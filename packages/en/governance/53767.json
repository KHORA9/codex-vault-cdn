S. DOWN TO THE TIME OF HIS\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\n1790-1826.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.--(_Confidential._)\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 24,1806.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A last effort at friendly settlement with Spain is proposed\r\nto be made at Paris, and under the auspices of France. For this purpose,\r\nGeneral Armstrong and Mr. Bowdoin (both now at Paris) have been appointed\r\njoint commissioners; but such a cloud of dissatisfaction rests on General\r\nArmstrong in the minds of many persons, on account of a late occurrence\r\nstated in all the public papers, that we have in contemplation to add\r\na third commissioner, in order to give the necessary measure of public\r\nconfidence to the commission. Of these two gentlemen, one being of\r\nMassachusetts and one of New York, it is thought the third should be\r\na southern man; and the rather, as the interests to be negotiated are\r\nalmost entirely southern and western. This addition is not yet ultimately\r\ndecided on; but I am inclined to believe it will be adopted. Under this\r\nexpectation, and my wish that you may be willing to undertake it, I give\r\nyou the earliest possible intimation of it, that you may be preparing\r\nboth your mind and your measures for the mission. The departure would be\r\nrequired to be very prompt; though the absence I think will not be long,\r\nBonaparte not being in the practice of procrastination. This particular\r\nconsideration will, I hope, reconcile the voyage to your affairs and your\r\nfeelings. The allowance to an extra mission, is salary from the day of\r\nleaving home, and expenses to the place of destination, or in lieu of the\r\nlatter, and to avoid settlements, a competent fixed sum may be given. For\r\nthe return, a continuance of the salary for three months after fulfilment\r\nof the commission. Be so good as to make up your mind as quickly as\r\npossible, and to answer me as early as possible. Consider the measure\r\nas proposed provisionally only, and not to be communicated to any mortal\r\nuntil we see it proper.\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 13, 1806.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The situation of your affairs certainly furnishes good cause\r\nfor your not acceding to my proposition of a special mission to Europe.\r\nMy only hope had been, that they could have gone on one summer without\r\nyou. An unjust hostility against General Armstrong will, I am afraid, show\r\nitself whenever any treaty made by him shall be offered for ratification.\r\nI wished, therefore, to provide against this, by joining a person who\r\nwould have united the confidence of the whole Senate. General Smith was\r\nso prominent in the opposition to Armstrong, that it would be impossible\r\nfor them to act together. We conclude, therefore, to leave the matter\r\nwith Armstrong and Bowdoin. Indeed, my dear Sir, I wish sincerely you\r\nwere back in the Senate; and that you would take the necessary measures\r\nto get yourself there. Perhaps, as a preliminary, you should go to our\r\nLegislature. Giles' absence has been a most serious misfortune. A majority\r\nof the Senate means well. But Tracy and Bayard are too dexterous for them,\r\nand have very much influenced their proceedings. Tracy has been of nearly\r\nevery committee during the session, and for the most part the chairman,\r\nand of course drawer of the reports. Seven federalists voting always\r\nin phalanx, and joined by some discontented republicans, some oblique\r\nones, some capricious, have so often made a majority, as to produce very\r\nserious embarrassment to the public operations; and very much do I dread\r\nthe submitting to them, at the next session, any treaty which can be\r\nmade with either England or Spain, when I consider that five joining the\r\nfederalists, can defeat a friendly settlement of our affairs. The House\r\nof Representatives is as well disposed as I ever saw one. The defection\r\nof so prominent a leader, threw them into dismay and confusion for a\r\nmoment; but they soon rallied to their own principles, and let them go\r\noff with five or six followers only. One half of these are from Virginia.\r\nHis late declaration of perpetual opposition to this administration, drew\r\noff a few others who at first had joined him, supposing his opposition\r\noccasional only, and not systematic. The alarm the House has had from this\r\nschism, has produced a rallying together and a harmony, which carelessness\r\nand security had begun to endanger. On the whole, this little trial of\r\nthe firmness of our representatives in their principles, and that of\r\nthe people also, which is declaring itself in support of their public\r\nfunctionaries, has added much to my confidence in the stability of our\r\ngovernment; and to my conviction, that, should things go wrong at any\r\ntime, the people will set them to rights by the peaceable exercise of\r\ntheir elective rights. To explain to you the character of this schism,\r\nits objects and combinations, can only be done in conversation; and must\r\nbe deferred till I see you at Monticello, where I shall probably be about\r\nthe 10th or 12th of May, to pass the rest of the month there. Congress has\r\nagreed to rise on Monday, the 21st.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HARRIS.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 18, 1806.\r\n\r\nSIR,--It is now some time since I received from you, through the house\r\nof Smith and Buchanan at Baltimore, a bust of the Emperor Alexander, for\r\nwhich I have to return you my thanks. These are the more cordial, because\r\nof the value the bust derives from the great estimation in which its\r\noriginal is held by the world, and by none more than by myself. It will\r\nconstitute one of the most valued ornaments of the retreat I am preparing\r\nfor myself at my native home. Accept, at the same time, my acknowledgments\r\nfor the elegant work of Atkinson and Walker on the customs of the\r\nRussians. I had laid it down as a law for my conduct while in office, and\r\nhitherto scrupulously observed, to accept of no present beyond a book, a\r\npamphlet, or other curiosity of minor value; as well to avoid imputation\r\non my motives of action, as to shut out a practice susceptible of such\r\nabuse. But my particular esteem for the character of the Emperor, places\r\nhis image in my mind above the scope of law. I receive it, therefore, and\r\nshall cherish it with affection. It nourishes the contemplation of all the\r\ngood placed in his power, and of his disposition to do it.\r\n\r\nA little before Dr. Priestley's death, he informed me that he had\r\nreceived intimations, through a channel he confided in, that the Emperor\r\nentertained a wish to know something of our Constitution. I have therefore\r\nselected the two best works we have on that subject, for which I pray\r\nyou to ask a place in his library. They are too much in detail to occupy\r\nhis time; but they will furnish materials for an abstract, to be made by\r\nothers, on such a scale as may bring the matter within the compass of the\r\ntime which his higher callings can yield to such an object.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period of my life, contemplating the history of the\r\naboriginal inhabitants of America, I was led to believe that if there had\r\never been a relation between them and the men of color in Asia, traces of\r\nit would be found in their several languages. I have therefore availed\r\nmyself of every opportunity which has offered, to obtain vocabularies\r\nof such tribes as have been within my reach, corresponding to a list\r\nthen formed of about two hundred and fifty words. In this I have made\r\nsuch progress, that within a year or two more I think to give to the\r\npublic what I then shall have acquired. I have lately seen a report of\r\nMr. Volney's to the Celtic academy, on a work of Mr. Pallas, entitled\r\n\"Vocabulaires compares des langues de toute la terre;\" with a list of one\r\nhundred and thirty words, to which the vocabulary is limited. I find that\r\nseventy-three of these words are common to that and to my vocabulary,\r\nand therefore will enable us, by a comparison of language, to make the\r\ninquiry so long desired, as to the probability of a common origin between\r\nthe people of color of the two continents. I have to ask the favor of you\r\nto procure me a copy of the above work of Pallas, to inform me of the\r\ncost, and permit me to pay it here to your use; for I presume you have\r\nsome mercantile correspondent here, to whom a payment can be made for\r\nyou. A want of knowledge what the book may cost, as well as of the means\r\nof making so small a remittance, obliges me to make this proposition, and\r\nto restrain it to the sole condition that I be permitted to reimburse it\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter for the Emperor, which be pleased to deliver or\r\nhave delivered; it has some relation to a subject which the Secretary of\r\nState will explain to you.\r\n\r\nAccept my salutations, and assurances of esteem and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 19, 1806.\r\n\r\nI owe an acknowledgment to your Imperial Majesty for the great\r\nsatisfaction I have received from your letter of August the 20th, 1805,\r\nand embrace the opportunity it affords of giving expression to the sincere\r\nrespect and veneration I entertain for your character. It will be among\r\nthe latest and most soothing comforts of my life, to have seen advanced\r\nto the government of so extensive a portion of the earth, and at so early\r\na period of his life, a sovereign whose ruling passion is the advancement\r\nof the happiness and prosperity of his people; and not of his own people\r\nonly, but who can extend his eye and his good will to a distant and infant\r\nnation, unoffending in its course, unambitious in its views.\r\n\r\nThe events of Europe come to us so late, and so suspiciously, that\r\nobservations on them would certainly be stale, and possibly wide of their\r\nactual state. From their general aspect, however, I collect that your\r\nMajesty's interposition in them has been disinterested and generous,\r\nand having in view only the general good of the great European family.\r\nWhen you shall proceed to the pacification which is to re-establish\r\npeace and commerce, the same dispositions of mind will lead you to think\r\nof the general intercourse of nations, and to make that provision for\r\nits future maintenance which, in times past, it has so much needed.\r\nThe northern nations of Europe, at the head of which your Majesty is\r\ndistinguished, are habitually peaceable. The United States of America,\r\nlike them, are attached to peace. We have then with them a common interest\r\nin the neutral rights. Every nation indeed, on the continent of Europe,\r\nbelligerent as well as neutral, is interested in maintaining these rights,\r\nin liberalizing them progressively with the progress of science and\r\nrefinement of morality, and in relieving them from restrictions which the\r\nextension of the arts has long since rendered unreasonable and vexatious.\r\n\r\nTwo personages in Europe, of which your Majesty is one, have it in their\r\npower, at the approaching pacification, to render eminent service to\r\nnations in general, by incorporating into the act of pacification, a\r\ncorrect definition of the rights of neutrals on the high seas. Such a\r\ndefinition, declared by all the powers lately or still belligerent, would\r\ngive to those rights a precision and notoriety, and cover them with an\r\nauthority, which would protect them in an important degree against future\r\nviolation; and should any further sanction be necessary, that of an\r\nexclusion of the violating nation from commercial intercourse with all the\r\nothers, would be preferred to war, as more analogous to the offence, more\r\neasy and likely to be executed with good faith. The essential articles of\r\nthese rights, too, are so few and simple as easily to be defined.\r\n\r\nHaving taken no part in the past or existing troubles of Europe, we have\r\nno part to act in its pacification. But as principles may then be settled\r\nin which we have a deep interest, it is a great happiness for us that\r\nthey are placed under the protection of an umpire, who, looking beyond\r\nthe narrow bounds of an individual nation, will take under the cover of\r\nhis equity the rights of the absent and unrepresented. It is only by a\r\nhappy concurrence of good characters and good occasions, that a step can\r\nnow and then be taken to advance the well-being of nations. If the present\r\noccasion be good, I am sure your Majesty's character will not be wanting\r\nto avail the world of it. By monuments of such good offices, may your life\r\nbecome an epoch in the history of the condition of man; and may He who\r\ncalled it into being, for the good of the human family, give it length of\r\ndays and success, and have it always in His holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 4, 1806.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 16th of March by a common vessel, and\r\nthen expected to have had, on the rising of Congress, an opportunity of\r\npeculiar confidence to you. Mr. Beckley then supposed he should take\r\na flying trip to London, on private business. But I believe he does\r\nnot find it convenient. He could have let you into the _arcana rerum_,\r\nwhich you have interests in knowing. Mr. Pinckney's pursuits having been\r\nconfined to his peculiar line, he has only that general knowledge of what\r\nhas passed here which the public possess. He has a just view of things\r\nso far as known to him. Our old friend, Mercer, broke off from us some\r\ntime ago; at first professing to disdain joining the federalists, yet,\r\nfrom the habit of voting together, becoming soon identified with them.\r\nWithout carrying over with him one single person, he is now in a state\r\nof as perfect obscurity as if his name had never been known. Mr. J.\r\nRandolph is in the same track, and will end in the same way. His course\r\nhas excited considerable alarm. Timid men consider it as a proof of the\r\nweakness of our government, and that it is to be rent into pieces by\r\ndemagogues, and to end in anarchy. I survey the scene with a different\r\neye, and draw a different augury from it. In a House of Representatives\r\nof a great mass of good sense, Mr. Randolph's popular eloquence gave him\r\nsuch advantages as to place him unrivalled as the leader of the House;\r\nand, although not conciliatory to those whom he led, principles of duty\r\nand patriotism induced many of them to swallow humiliations he subjected\r\nthem to, and to vote as was right, as long as he kept the path of right\r\nhimself. The sudden defection of such a man could not but produce a\r\nmomentary astonishment, and even dismay; but for a moment only. The\r\ngood sense of the House rallied around its principles, and without any\r\nleader pursued steadily the business of the session, did it well, and\r\nby a strength of vote which has never before been seen. Upon all trying\r\nquestions, exclusive of the federalists, the minority of republicans\r\nvoting with him has been from four to six or eight, against from ninety\r\nto one hundred; and although he yet treats the federalists with ineffable\r\ncontempt, yet, having declared eternal opposition to this administration,\r\nand consequently associated with them in his votes, he will, like Mercer,\r\nend with them. The augury I draw from this is, that there is a steady,\r\ngood sense in the Legislature, and in the body of the nation, joined\r\nwith good intentions, which will lead them to discern and to pursue the\r\npublic good under all circumstances which can arise, and that no _ignis\r\nfatuus_ will be able to lead them long astray. In the present case, the\r\npublic sentiment, as far as declarations of it have yet come in, is,\r\nwithout a single exception, in firm adherence to the administration. One\r\npopular paper is endeavoring to maintain equivocal ground; approving the\r\nadministration in all its proceedings, and Mr. Randolph in all those which\r\nhave heretofore merited approbation, carefully avoiding to mention his\r\nlate aberration. The ultimate view of this paper is friendly to you; and\r\nthe editor, with more judgment than him who assumes to be at the head of\r\nyour friends, sees that the ground of opposition to the administration\r\nis not that on which it would be advantageous to you to be planted.\r\nThe great body of your friends are among the firmest adherents to the\r\nadministration; and in their support of you, will suffer Mr. Randolph to\r\nhave no communications with them. My former letter told you the line which\r\nboth duty and inclination would lead me sacredly to pursue. But it is\r\nunfortunate for you to be embarrassed with such a _soi-disant_ friend. You\r\nmust not commit yourself to him. These views may assist you to understand\r\nsuch details as Mr. Pinckney will give you. If you are here at any time\r\nbefore the fall, it will be in time for any object you may have, and by\r\nthat time the public sentiment will be more decisively declared. I wish\r\nyou were here at present, to take your choice of the two governments\r\nof Orleans and Louisiana, in either of which I could now place you;\r\nand I verily believe it would be to your advantage to be just that much\r\nwithdrawn from the focus of the ensuing contest, until its event should\r\nbe known. The one has a salary of five thousand dollars, the other of two\r\nthousand dollars; both with excellent hotels for the Governor. The latter\r\nat St. Louis, where there is good society, both French and American; a\r\nhealthy climate, and the finest field in the United States for acquiring\r\nproperty. The former not unhealthy, if you begin a residence there in the\r\nmonth of November. The Mrs. Trists and their connections are established\r\nthere. As I think you can within four months inform me what you say to\r\nthis, I will keep things in their present state till the last day of\r\nAugust, for your answer.\r\n\r\nThe late change in the ministry I consider as insuring us a just\r\nsettlement of our differences, and we ask no more. In Mr. Fox, personally,\r\nI have more confidence than in any man in England, and it is founded\r\nin what, through unquestionable channels, I have had opportunities of\r\nknowing of his honesty and his good sense. While he shall be in the\r\nadministration, my reliance on that government will be solid. We had\r\ncommitted ourselves in a line of proceedings adapted to meet Mr. Pitt's\r\npolicy and hostility, before we heard of his death, which self-respect did\r\nnot permit us to abandon afterwards; and the late unparalleled outrage on\r\nus at New York excited such sentiments in the public at large, as did not\r\npermit us to do less than has been done. It ought not to be viewed by the\r\nministry as looking towards them at all, but merely as the consequences\r\nof the measures of their predecessors, which their nation has called on\r\nthem to correct. I hope, therefore, they will come to just arrangements.\r\nNo two countries upon earth have so many points of common interest and\r\nfriendship; and their rulers must be great bunglers indeed, if, with such\r\ndispositions, they break them asunder. The only rivalry that can arise\r\nis on the ocean. England may, by petty larceny thwartings, check us on\r\nthat element a little, but nothing she can do will retard us there one\r\nyear's growth. We shall be supported there by other nations, and thrown\r\ninto their scale to make a part of the great counterpoise to her navy.\r\nIf, on the other hand, she is just to us, conciliatory, and encourages\r\nthe sentiment of family feelings and conduct, it cannot fail to befriend\r\nthe security of both. We have the seamen and materials for fifty ships\r\nof the line, and half that number of frigates; and were France to give\r\nus the money, and England the dispositions to equip them, they would\r\ngive to England serious proofs of the stock from which they are sprung,\r\nand the school in which they have been taught; and added to the efforts\r\nof the immensity of sea coast lately united under one power, would leave\r\nthe state of the ocean no longer problematical. Were, on the other hand,\r\nEngland to give the money, and France the dispositions to place us on the\r\nsea in all our force, the whole world, out of the continent of Europe,\r\nmight be our joint monopoly. We wish for neither of these scenes. We\r\nask for peace and justice from all nations; and we will remain uprightly\r\nneutral in fact, though leaning in belief to the opinion that an English\r\nascendancy on the ocean is safer for us than that of France. We begin to\r\nbroach the idea that we consider the whole Gulf Stream as of our waters,\r\nin which hostilities and cruising are to be frowned on for the present,\r\nand prohibited so soon as either consent or force will permit us. We shall\r\nnever permit another privateer to cruise within it, and shall forbid our\r\nharbors to national cruisers. This is essential for our tranquillity and\r\ncommerce. Be so good as to have the enclosed letters delivered, to present\r\nme to your family, and be assured yourself of my unalterable friendship.\r\n\r\nFor fear of accidents, I shall not make the unnecessary addition of my\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 4, 1806.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor covering some papers from General\r\nWilkinson. I have repented but of one appointment there, that of Lucas,\r\nwhose temper I see overrules every good quality and every qualification\r\nhe has. Not a single fact has appeared, which occasions me to doubt that\r\nI could have made a fitter appointment than General Wilkinson. One qualm\r\nof principle I acknowledge I do feel, I mean the union of the civil and\r\nmilitary authority. You remember that when I came into office, while\r\nwe were lodging together at Conrad's, he was pressed on me to be made\r\nGovernor of the Mississippi territory; and that I refused it on that very\r\nprinciple. When, therefore, the House of Representatives took that ground,\r\nI was not insensible to its having some weight. But in the appointment\r\nto Louisiana, I did not think myself departing from my own principle,\r\nbecause I consider it not as a civil government, but merely a military\r\nstation. The Legislature had sanctioned that idea by the establishment\r\nof the office of Commandant, in which were completely blended the civil\r\nand military powers. It seemed, therefore, that the Governor should be in\r\nsuit with them. I observed, too, that the House of Representatives, on the\r\nvery day they passed the stricture on this union of authorities, passed\r\na bill making the Governor of Michigan commander of the regular troops\r\nwhich should at any time be within his government. However, on the subject\r\nof General Wilkinson nothing is in contemplation at this time. We shall\r\nsee what turn things take at home and abroad in the course of the summer.\r\nMonroe has had a second conversation with Mr. Fox, which gives me hopes\r\nthat we shall have an amicable arrangement with that government. Accept my\r\nfriendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DIGGES.\r\n\r\n                                                              July 1, 1806.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson salutes Mr. Digges with friendship and respect, and sends\r\nhim the newspapers received last night. He is sorry that only the latter\r\npart of the particular publication which Mr. Digges wished to see, is in\r\nthem. He will be happy to see Mr. Digges and his friends on the fourth\r\nof July, and to join in congratulations on the return of the day which\r\ndivorced us from the follies and crimes of Europe, from a dollar in the\r\npound at least of six hundred millions sterling, and from all the ruin\r\nof Mr. Pitt's administration. We, too, shall encounter follies; but if\r\ngreat, they will be short, if long, they will be light; and the vigor\r\nof our country will get the better of them. Mr. Pitt's follies have been\r\ngreat, long, and inflicted on a body emaciated with age, and exhausted by\r\nexcesses beyond its power to bear.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BIDWELL.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 5, 1806.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of June the 21st has been duly received. We have not\r\nas yet heard from General Skinner on the subject of his office. Three\r\npersons are proposed on the most respectable recommendations, and under\r\ncircumstances of such equality as renders it difficult to decide between\r\nthem. But it shall be done impartially. I sincerely congratulate you on\r\nthe triumph of republicanism in Massachusetts. The Hydra of federalism\r\nhas now lost all its heads but two. Connecticut I think will soon follow\r\nMassachusetts. Delaware will probably remain what it ever has been, a mere\r\ncounty of England, conquered indeed, and held under by force, but always\r\ndisposed to counter-revolution. I speak of its majority only.\r\n\r\nOur information from London continues to give us hopes of an accommodation\r\nthere on both the points of \"accustomed commerce and impressment.\" In this\r\nthere must probably be some mutual concession, because we cannot expect\r\nto obtain everything and yield nothing. But I hope it will be such an one\r\nas may be accepted. The arrival of the Hornet in France is so recently\r\nknown, that it will yet be some time before we learn our prospects there.\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts made here, and made professedly to assassinate\r\nthat negotiation in embryo, if the good sense of Bonaparte should prevail\r\nover his temper, the present state of things in Europe may induce him\r\nto require of Spain that she should do us justice at least. That he\r\nshould require her to sell us East Florida, we have no right to insist;\r\nyet there are not wanting considerations which may induce him to wish a\r\npermanent foundation for peace laid between us. In this treaty, whatever\r\nit shall be, our old enemies the federalists, and their new friends, will\r\nfind enough to carp at. This is a thing of course, and I should suspect\r\nerror where they found no fault. The buzzard feeds on carrion only. Their\r\nrallying point is \"war with France and Spain, and alliance with Great\r\nBritain:\" and everything is wrong with them which checks their new ardor\r\nto be fighting for the liberties of mankind; on the sea always excepted.\r\nThere one nation is to monopolize all the liberties of the others.\r\n\r\nI read, with extreme regret, the expressions of an inclination on your\r\npart to retire from Congress. I will not say that this time, more than all\r\nothers, calls for the service of every man; but I will say, there never\r\nwas a time when the services of those who possess talents, integrity,\r\nfirmness, and sound judgment, were more wanted in Congress. Some one of\r\nthat description is particularly wanted to take the lead in the House\r\nof Representatives, to consider the business of the nation as his own\r\nbusiness, to take it up as if he were singly charged with it, and carry it\r\nthrough. I do not mean that any gentleman, relinquishing his own judgment,\r\nshould implicitly support all the measures of the administration; but\r\nthat, where he does not disapprove of them, he should not suffer them\r\nto go off in sleep, but bring them to the attention of the House, and\r\ngive them a fair chance. Where he disapproves, he will of course leave\r\nthem to be brought forward by those who concur in the sentiment. Shall\r\nI explain my idea by an example? The classification of the militia was\r\ncommunicated to General Varnum and yourself merely as a proposition,\r\nwhich, if you approved, it was trusted you would support. I knew, indeed,\r\nthat General Varnum was opposed to anything which might break up the\r\npresent organization of the militia: but when so modified as to avoid\r\nthis, I thought he might, perhaps, be reconciled to it. As soon as I found\r\nit did not coincide with your sentiments, I could not wish you to support\r\nit; but using the same freedom of opinion, I procured it to be brought\r\nforward elsewhere. It failed there, also, and for a time, perhaps, may\r\nnot prevail; but a militia can never be used for distant service on any\r\nother plan; and Bonaparte will conquer the world, if they do not learn his\r\nsecret of composing armies of young men only, whose enthusiasm and health\r\nenable them to surmount all obstacles. When a gentleman, through zeal for\r\nthe public service, undertakes to do the public business, we know that we\r\nshall hear the cant of backstairs' councillors. But we never heard this\r\nwhile the declaimer was himself a backstairs' man, as he calls it, but\r\nin the confidence and views of the administration, as may more properly\r\nand respectfully be said. But if the members are to know nothing but\r\nwhat is important enough to be put into a public message, and indifferent\r\nenough to be made known to all the world; if the Executive is to keep all\r\nother information to himself, and the House to plunge on in the dark, it\r\nbecomes a government of chance and not of design. The imputation was one\r\nof those artifices used to despoil an adversary of his most effectual\r\narms; and men of mind will place themselves above a gabble of this order.\r\nThe last session of Congress was indeed an uneasy one for a time; but as\r\nsoon as the members penetrated into the views of those who were taking a\r\nnew course, they rallied in as solid a phalanx as I have ever seen act\r\ntogether. Indeed I have never seen a House of better dispositions.\r\n* * * * * Perhaps I am not entitled to speak with so much frankness; but\r\nit proceeds from no motive which has not a right to your forgiveness.\r\nOpportunities of candid explanation are so seldom afforded me, that I must\r\nnot lose them when they occur.\r\n\r\nThe information I receive from your quarter agrees with that from the\r\nsouth; that the late schism has made not the smallest impression on the\r\npublic, and that the seceders are obliged to give to it other grounds than\r\nthose which we know to be the true ones. All we have to wish is, that at\r\nthe ensuing session, every one may take the part openly which he secretly\r\nbefriends. I recollect nothing new and true, worthy communicating to you.\r\nAs for what is not true, you will always find abundance in the newspapers.\r\nAmong other things, are those perpetual alarms as to the Indians, for\r\nno one of which has there ever been the slightest ground. They are the\r\nsuggestions of hostile traders, always wishing to embroil us with the\r\nIndians, to perpetuate their own extortionate commerce. I salute you with\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 10, 1806.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I believe that when you left America the invention of the\r\npolygraph had not yet reached Boston. It is for copying with one pen while\r\nyou write with the other, and without the least additional embarrassment\r\nor exertion to the writer. I think it the finest invention of the present\r\nage, and so much superior to the copying machine, that the latter will\r\nnever be continued a day by any one who tries the polygraph. It was\r\ninvented by a Mr. Hawkins, of Frankford, near Philadelphia, who is now in\r\nEngland, turning it to good account. Knowing that you are in the habit of\r\nwriting much, I have flattered myself that I could add acceptably to your\r\ndaily convenience by presenting you with one of these delightful machines.\r\nI have accordingly had one made, and to be certain of its perfection I\r\nhave used it myself some weeks, and have the satisfaction to find it the\r\nbest one I have ever tried; and in the course of two years' daily use of\r\nthem, I have had opportunities of trying several. As a secretary, which\r\ncopies for us what we write without the power of revealing it, I find it a\r\nmost precious possession to a man in public business. I enclose directions\r\nfor unpacking and using the machine when you receive it; but the machine\r\nitself must await a special and sure conveyance under the care of some\r\nperson going to Paris. It is ready packed, and shall go by the first\r\nproper conveyance.\r\n\r\nAs we heard two or three weeks ago of the safe arrival of the Hornet\r\nat L'Orient, we were anxiously waiting to learn from you the first\r\nimpressions on her mission. If you can succeed in procuring us Florida,\r\nand a good western boundary, it will fill the American mind with joy.\r\nIt will secure to our fellow citizens one of the most ardent wishes,\r\na long peace with Spain and France. For be assured, the object of war\r\nwith them and alliance with England, which, at the last session of\r\nCongress, drew off from the republican band about half a dozen of its\r\nmembers, is universally reprobated by our _native_ citizens from north to\r\nsouth. I have never seen the nation stand more firm to its principles,\r\nor rally so firmly to its constituted authorities, and in reprobation\r\nof the opposition to them. With England, I think we shall cut off the\r\nresource of impressing our seamen to fight her battles, and establish the\r\ninviolability of our flag in its commerce with her enemies. We shall thus\r\nbecome what we sincerely wish to be, honestly neutral, and truly useful to\r\nboth belligerents. To the one, by keeping open market for the consumption\r\nof her manufactures, while they are excluded from all the other countries\r\nunder the power of her enemy; to the other, by securing for her a safe\r\ncarriage of all her productions, metropolitan or colonial, while her own\r\nmeans are restrained by her enemy, and may, therefore, be employed in\r\nother useful pursuits. We are certainly more useful friends to France and\r\nSpain as neutrals, than as allies. I hope they will be sensible of it,\r\nand by a wise removal of all grounds of future misunderstanding to another\r\nage, enable you to present us such an arrangement, as will insure to our\r\nfellow-citizens long and permanent peace and friendship with them. With\r\nrespect to our western boundary, your instructions will be your guide. I\r\nwill only add, as a comment to them, that we are attached to the retaining\r\nof the Bay of St. Bernard, because it was the first establishment of the\r\nunfortunate La Sale, was the cradle of Louisiana, and more incontestibly\r\ncovered and conveyed to us by France, under that name, than any other\r\nspot in the country. This will be secured to us by taking for our western\r\nboundary the Guadaloupe, and from its head around the sources of all\r\nwaters eastward of it, to the highlands embracing the waters running into\r\nthe Mississippi. However, all these things I presume will be settled\r\nbefore you receive this; and I hope so settled as to give peace and\r\nsatisfaction to us all.\r\n\r\nOur crops of wheat are greater than have ever been known, and are now\r\nnearly secured. A caterpillar gave for awhile great alarm, but did little\r\ninjury. Of tobacco, not half a crop has been planted for want of rain; and\r\neven this half, with cotton and Indian corn, has yet many chances to run.\r\n\r\nThis summer will place our harbors in a situation to maintain peace and\r\norder with them. The next, or certainly the one following that, will\r\nso provide them with gun-boats and common batteries, as to be _hors\r\nd'insulte_. Although our prospect is peace, our policy and purpose is\r\nto provide for defence by all those means to which our resources are\r\ncompetent.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship, and assure you of my high respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. A. BURWELL.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 17, 1806.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of August the 7th, from Liberty, never got to my hands\r\ntill the 9th instant. About the same time I received the Enquirer,\r\nin which Decius was so judiciously answered. The writer of that paper\r\nobserved, that the matter of Decius consisted, first of facts; secondly,\r\nof inferences from these facts: that he was not well enough informed to\r\naffirm or deny his facts, and he therefore examines his inferences, and in\r\na very masterly manner shows that even were his facts true, the reasonable\r\ninferences from them are very different from those drawn by Decius. But\r\nhis facts are far from truth, and should be corrected. It happened that\r\nMr. Madison and General Dearborne were here when I received your letter.\r\nI therefore, with them, took up Decius and read him deliberately; and\r\nour memories aided one another in correcting his bold and unauthorized\r\nassertions. I shall note the most material of them in the order of the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n1. It is grossly false that our ministers, as is said in a note, had\r\nproposed to surrender our claims to compensation for Spanish spoliations,\r\nor even for French. Their instructions were to make no treaty in which\r\nSpanish spoliations were not provided for; and although they were\r\npermitted to be silent as to French spoliations carried into Spanish\r\nports, they were not expressly to abandon even them. 2. It is not true\r\nthat our ministers, in agreeing to establish the Colorado as our western\r\nboundary, had been obliged to exceed the authority of their instructions.\r\nAlthough we considered our title good as far as the Rio Bravo, yet in\r\nproportion to what they could obtain east of the Mississippi, they were\r\nto relinquish to the westward, and successive sacrifices were marked\r\nout, of which even the Colorado was not the last. 3. It is not true that\r\nthe Louisiana treaty was antedated, lest Great Britain should consider\r\nour supplying her enemies with money as a breach of neutrality. After\r\nthe very words of the treaty were finally agreed to, it took some time,\r\nperhaps some days, to make out all the copies in the very splendid\r\nmanner of Bonaparte's treaties. Whether the 30th of April, 1803, the\r\ndate expressed, was the day of the actual compact, or that on which it\r\nwas signed, our memories do not enable us to say. If the former, then it\r\nis strictly conformable to the day of the compact; if the latter, then\r\nit was postdated, instead of being antedated. The motive assigned too,\r\nis as incorrect as the fact. It was so far from being thought, by any\r\nparty, a breach of neutrality, that the British minister congratulated\r\nMr. King on the acquisition, and declared that the King had learned it\r\nwith great pleasure; and when Baring, the British banker, asked leave\r\nof the minister to purchase the debt and furnish the money to France,\r\nthe minister declared to him, that so far from throwing obstacles in the\r\nway, if there were any difficulty in the payment of the money, it was\r\nthe interest of Great Britain to aid it. 4. He speaks of a double set of\r\nopinions and principles; the one ostensible, to go on the journals and\r\nbefore the public, the other efficient, and the real motives to action.\r\nBut where are these double opinions and principles? The executive informed\r\nthe legislature of the wrongs of Spain, and that preparation should be\r\nmade to repel them, by force, if necessary. But as it might still be\r\npossible to negotiate a settlement, they asked such means as might enable\r\nthem to meet the negotiation, whatever form it might take. The first\r\npart of this system was communicated publicly, the second privately; but\r\nboth were equally official, equally involved the responsibility of the\r\nexecutive, and were equally to go on the journals. 5. That the purchase\r\nof the Floridas was in direct opposition to the views of the executive,\r\nas expressed in the President's _official_ communication. It was not in\r\nopposition even to the public part of the communication, which did not\r\nrecommend war, but only to be prepared for it. It perfectly harmonized\r\nwith the private part, which asked the means of negotiation in such terms\r\nas covered the purchase of Florida as evidently as it was proper to speak\r\nit out. He speaks of secret communications between the executive and\r\nmembers, of backstairs' influence, &c. But he never spoke of this while\r\nhe and Mr. Nicholson enjoyed it most solely. But when he differed from the\r\nexecutive in a leading measure, and the executive, not submitting to him,\r\nexpressed their sentiments to others, the very sentiments (to wit, the\r\npurchase of Florida) which he acknowledges they expressed to him, then he\r\nroars out upon backstairs' influence. 6. The committee, he says, forbore\r\nto recommend offensive measures. Is this true? Did not they recommend\r\nthe raising ---- regiments? Besides, if it was proper for the committee\r\nto forbear recommending offensive measures, was it not proper for the\r\nexecutive and Legislature to exercise the same forbearance? 7. He says\r\nMonroe's letter had a most important bearing on our Spanish relations.\r\nMonroe's letter related, almost entirely, to our British relations. Of\r\nthose with Spain he knew nothing particular since he left that country.\r\nAccordingly, in his letter he simply expressed an opinion on our affairs\r\nwith Spain, of which he knew we had better information than he could\r\npossess. His opinion was no more than that of any other sensible man; and\r\nhis letter was proper to be communicated with the English papers, and with\r\nthem only. That the executive did not hold it up on account of any bearing\r\non Spanish affairs, is evident from the fact that it was communicated\r\nwhen the Senate had not yet entered on the Spanish affairs, and had not\r\nyet received the papers relating to them from the other House. The moment\r\nthe Representatives were ready to enter on the British affairs, Monroe's\r\nletter, which peculiarly related to them, and was _official_ solely as\r\nto them, was communicated to both Houses, the Senate being then about\r\nentering on Spanish affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese, my dear Sir, are the principal facts worth correction. Make any\r\nuse of them you think best, without letting your source of information be\r\nknown. Can you send me some cones or seeds of the cucumber tree? Accept\r\naffectionate salutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 12, 1806.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--You witnessed in the earlier part of the administration, the\r\nmalignant and long-continued efforts which the federalists exerted in\r\ntheir newspapers, to produce misunderstanding between Mr. Madison and\r\nmyself. These failed completely. A like attempt was afterwards made,\r\nthrough other channels, to effect a similar purpose between General\r\nDearborne and myself, but with no more success. The machinations of the\r\nlast session to put you at cross questions with us all, were so obvious\r\nas to be seen at the first glance of every eye. In order to destroy one\r\nmember of the administration, the whole were to be set to loggerheads\r\nto destroy one another. I observe in the papers lately, new attempts to\r\nrevive this stale artifice, and that they squint more directly towards\r\nyou and myself. I cannot, therefore, be satisfied, till I declare to you\r\nexplicitly, that my affections and confidence in you are nothing impaired,\r\nand that they cannot be impaired by means so unworthy the notice of candid\r\nand honorable minds. I make the declaration, that no doubts or jealousies,\r\nwhich often beget the facts they fear, may find a moment's harbor in\r\neither of our minds. I have so much reliance on the superior good sense\r\nand candor of all those associated with me, as to be satisfied they will\r\nnot suffer either friend or foe to sow tares among us. Our administration\r\nnow drawing towards a close, I have a sublime pleasure in believing\r\nit will be distinguished as much by having placed itself above all the\r\npassions which could disturb its harmony, as by the great operations by\r\nwhich it will have advanced the well-being of the nation.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of my constant and\r\nunalterable respect and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 3, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had intended yesterday to recommend to General Dearborne\r\nthe writing to you weekly by post, to convey information of our western\r\naffairs, so long as they are interesting, because it is possible, though\r\nnot probable, you might sometimes get the information quicker this way\r\nthan down the river, but the General received yesterday information of\r\nthe death of his son in the East Indies, and of course cannot now attend\r\nto business. I therefore write you a hasty line for the present week, and\r\nsend it in duplicates by the Athens and the Nashville routes.\r\n\r\nThe information in the enclosed paper, as to proceedings in the State\r\nof Ohio, is correct. Blennerhasset's flotilla of fifteen boats and two\r\nhundred barrels of provisions, is seized, and there can be no doubt that\r\nTyler's flotilla is also taken, because, on the 17th of December, we\r\nknow there was a sufficient force assembled at Cincinnati to intercept it\r\nthere, and another party was in pursuit of it on the river above. We are\r\nassured that these two flotillas composed the whole of the boats, provided\r\nBlennerhasset and Tyler had fled down the river. I do not believe that\r\nthe number of persons engaged for Burr has ever amounted to five hundred,\r\nthough some have carried them to one thousand or fifteen hundred. A part\r\nof these were engaged as settlers of Bastrop's land, but the greater\r\npart of these were engaged under the express assurance that the projected\r\nenterprise was against Mexico, and secretly authorized by this government.\r\nMany were expressly enlisted in the name of the United States. The\r\nproclamation which reached Pittsburg, December 2d, and the other parts of\r\nthe river successively, undeceived both these classes, and of course drew\r\nthem off, and I have never seen any proof of their having assembled more\r\nthan forty men in two boats from Beaver, fifty in Tyler's flotilla, and\r\nthe boatmen of Blennerhasset's. I believe therefore, that the enterprise\r\nmay be considered as crushed, but we are not to relax in our attentions\r\nuntil we hear what has passed at Louisville. If everything from that place\r\nupwards be successfully arrested, there is nothing from below that is to\r\nbe feared. Be assured that Tennessee, and particularly General Jackson,\r\nare faithful. The orders lodged at Massac and the Chickasaw bluffs, will\r\nprobably secure the interception of such fugitives from justice as may\r\nescape from Louisville, so that I think you will never see one of them.\r\nStill I would not wish, till we hear from Louisville, that you should\r\nrelax your preparations in the least, except so far as to dispense with\r\nthe militia of Mississippi and Orleans leaving their homes under our order\r\nof November 25th. Only let them consider themselves under requisition, and\r\nbe in a state of readiness should any force, too great for your regulars,\r\nescape down the river. You will have been sensible that those orders were\r\ngiven while we supposed you were on the Sabine, and the supposed crisis\r\ndid not admit the formality of their being passed through you. We had\r\nconsidered Fort Adams as the place to make a stand, because it covered the\r\nmouth of the Red river. You have preferred New Orleans on the apprehension\r\nof a fleet from the West Indies. Be assured there is not any foundation\r\nfor such an expectation, but the lying exaggerations of those traitors to\r\nimpose on others and swell their pretended means. The very man whom they\r\nrepresented to you as gone to Jamaica, and to bring the fleet, has never\r\nbeen from home, and has regularly communicated to me everything which\r\nhad passed between Burr and him. No such proposition was ever hazarded to\r\nhim. France or Spain would not send a fleet to take Vera Cruz; and though\r\none of the expeditions now near arriving from England, is probably for\r\nVera Cruz, and perhaps already there, yet the state of things between us\r\nrenders it impossible they should countenance an enterprise unauthorized\r\nby us. Still I repeat that these grounds of security must not stop our\r\nproceedings or preparations until they are further confirmed. Go on,\r\ntherefore, with your works for the defence of New Orleans, because they\r\nwill always be useful, only looking to what should be permanent rather\r\nthan means merely temporary. You may expect further information as we\r\nreceive it, and though I expect it will be such as will place us at our\r\nease, yet we must not place ourselves so until it be certain, but act on\r\nthe possibility that the resources of our enemy may be greater and deeper\r\nthan we are yet informed.\r\n\r\nYour two confidential messengers delivered their charges safely. One\r\narrived yesterday only with your letter of November 12th. The oral\r\ncommunications he made me are truly important. I beseech you to take the\r\nmost special care of the two letters which he mentioned to me, the one in\r\ncypher, the other from another of the conspirators of high standing, and\r\nto send them to me by the first conveyance you can trust. It is necessary\r\nthat all important testimony should be brought to one centre, in order\r\nthat the guilty may be convicted, and the innocent left untroubled. Accept\r\nmy friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                           January 4, 1807.\r\n\r\nThere is a vessel fitting out at New York, formerly called the Emperor,\r\nnow the James, or the Brutus (accounts differ), to carry 22 guns and\r\n150 men, and to be commanded by Blakely, who went out Lieutenant of\r\nthe Leander. She is confidently believed to be destined for Burr at\r\nNew Orleans. The collector should be put on his guard; he can get much\r\ninformation from the Mayor of New York on the subject. If Blakely went out\r\nreally with Miranda as Lieutenant, he should be immediately arrested and\r\nput on his trial. Will you be so good as to take the necessary measures on\r\nthis subject?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                           January 6, 1807.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke left with me the papers I now send you, presenting the claim of\r\nthe Corporation of New Orleans to all the lands between the city and the\r\nBayou St. Jean, as a common. What is to be done? The subject is broader\r\nthan these papers present. I presume this claim would be proper for an\r\ninvestigation and report by the commissioners. I believe it to be a plot\r\nagainst Lafayette. That there should be left a reasonable common for them\r\nwe had directed; but they might as well claim to the ocean as to the Bayou\r\nSt. Jean. I am certain there is in some of Claiborne's letters information\r\nthat they never had a right to a common, but under a kind of lease or\r\npermission for a term of years expired long since.\r\n\r\nBut I think we should go further, and direct the governor to report to us\r\nin detail all the lots and buildings owned by the public in New Orleans,\r\nstating the use they were applied to under the former government, and that\r\nfor which they would be proper now; to be laid before Congress at their\r\nnext session, for their determination. Indeed I am not certain but that\r\nClaiborne has made such a report to the Secretary at War. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CHARLES CLAY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of December 19th has been duly received, and I thank\r\nyou for your friendly attention to the offer of lands adjoining me for\r\nsale. It is true that I have always wished to purchase a part of what was\r\nMurray's tract, which would straiten the lines of the Poplar Forest, but\r\nI really am not able to make a purchase. I had hoped to keep the expenses\r\nof my office within the limits of its salary, so as to apply my private\r\nincome entirely to the improvement and enlargement of my estate; but I\r\nhave not been able to do it.\r\n\r\nOur affairs with Spain, after which you inquire, do not promise the\r\nresult we wish. Not that war will take place immediately, but they may\r\ngo off without a settlement, and leave us in constant bickering about\r\nindemnification for spoliations, the navigation of the Mobile and the\r\nlimits of Louisiana. Burr's enterprise is the most extraordinary since\r\nthe days of Don Quixotte. It is so extravagant that those who know his\r\nunderstanding, would not believe it if the proofs admitted doubt. He has\r\nmeant to place himself on the throne of Montezuma, and extend his empire\r\nto the Alleghany, seizing on New Orleans as the instrument of compulsion\r\nfor our western States. I think his undertaking effectually crippled by\r\nthe activity of Ohio. Whether Kentucky will give him the _coup de grace_\r\nis doubtful; but if he is able to descend the river with any means, we\r\nare sufficiently prepared at New Orleans. I hope, however, Kentucky will\r\ndo its duty, and finish the matter for the honor of popular government,\r\nand the discouragement of all arguments for standing armies. Accept my\r\nfriendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JONATHAN WILLIAMS AND C. W. PEALE, JUDGES OF ELECTION FOR THE A. P.\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I am again to return the tribute of my thanks for the\r\ncontinued proofs of favor from the American Philosophical Society; and I\r\never do it with sincere gratitude, sensible it is the effect of their good\r\nwill, and not of any services I have it in my power to render them. I pray\r\nyou to convey to them these expressions of my dutiful acknowledgments, and\r\nto accept yourselves thanks for the favorable terms in which your letter\r\nof the 2d instant announces the suffrage of the Society.\r\n\r\nI am happy at the same time to greet them on the safe return of a valuable\r\nmember of our fraternity, from a journey of uncommon length and peril. He\r\nwill ere long be with them, and present them with the additions he brings\r\nto our knowledge of the geography and natural history of our country, from\r\nthe Mississippi to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nTendering them my humble respects, permit me to add for yourselves my\r\nfriendly salutations, and assurances of high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nI return you the letter of Mr. Gelston respecting the Brutus. From what I\r\nlearn, she cannot be destined for the Mississippi, because she draws too\r\nmuch water to enter it. However, considering the difficulty Congress finds\r\nin enlarging the limits of our preventive powers, I think we should be\r\ncautious how we step across those limits ourselves. She is probably bound\r\nto St. Domingo. Could not Congress, while continuing that law, amend it so\r\nas to prevent the abuse actually practised. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 13, 1807.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AND ANCIENT FRIEND,--I have duly received your favor of the 1st\r\ninstant, and am ever thankful for communications which may guide me in the\r\nduties which I wish to perform as well as I am able. It is but too true\r\nthat great discontents exist in the territory of Orleans. Those of the\r\nFrench inhabitants have for their sources, 1, the prohibition of importing\r\nslaves. This may be partly removed by Congress permitting them to receive\r\nslaves from the other States, which, by dividing that evil, would lessen\r\nits danger; 2, the administration of justice in our forms, principles,\r\nand language, with all of which they are unacquainted, and are the more\r\nabhorrent, because of the enormous expense, greatly exaggerated by the\r\ncorruption of bankrupt and greedy lawyers, who have gone there from the\r\nUnited States and engrossed the practice; 3, the call on them by the land\r\ncommissioners to produce the titles of their lands. The object of this\r\nis really to record and secure their rights. But as many of them hold on\r\nrights so ancient that the title papers are lost; they expect the land\r\nis to be taken from them whenever they cannot produce a regular deduction\r\nof title in writing. In this they will be undeceived by the final result,\r\nwhich will evince to them a liberal disposition of the government towards\r\nthem. Among the American inhabitants it is the old division of federalists\r\nand republicans. The former are as hostile there as they are everywhere,\r\nand are the most numerous and wealthy. They have been long endeavoring\r\nto batter down the Governor, who has always been a firm republican. There\r\nwere characters superior to him whom I wished to appoint, but they refused\r\nthe office: I know no better man who would accept of it, and it would not\r\nbe right to turn him out for one not better. But it is the second cause,\r\nabove mentioned, which is deep-seated and permanent. The French members\r\nof the Legislature, being the majority in both Houses, lately passed\r\nan act declaring that the civil, or French laws, should be the laws of\r\ntheir land, and enumerated about fifty folio volumes, in Latin, as the\r\ndepositories of these laws. The Governor negatived the act. One of the\r\nHouses thereupon passed a vote for self-dissolution of the Legislature\r\nas a useless body, which failed in the other House by a single vote\r\nonly. They separated, however, and have disseminated all the discontent\r\nthey could. I propose to the members of Congress in conversation, the\r\nenlisting thirty thousand volunteers, Americans by birth, to be carried\r\nat the public expense, and settled immediately on a bounty of one hundred\r\nand sixty acres of land each, on the west side of the Mississippi, on the\r\ncondition of giving two years of military service, if that country should\r\nbe attacked within seven years. The defence of the country would thus be\r\nplaced on the spot, and the additional number would entitle the territory\r\nto become a State, would make the majority American, and make it an\r\nAmerican instead of a French State. This would not sweeten the pill to the\r\nFrench; but in making that acquisition we had some view to our own good as\r\nwell as theirs, and I believe the greatest good of both will be promoted\r\nby whatever will amalgamate us together.\r\n\r\nI have tired you, my friend, with a long letter. But your tedium will\r\nend in a few lines more. Mine has yet two years to endure. I am tired\r\nof an office where I can do no more good than many others, who would\r\nbe glad to be employed in it. To myself, personally, it brings nothing\r\nbut unceasing drudgery and daily loss of friends. Every office becoming\r\nvacant, every appointment made, _me donne un ingrat, et cent ennemis_. My\r\nonly consolation is in the belief that my fellow citizens at large give\r\nme credit for good intentions. I will certainly endeavor to merit the\r\ncontinuance of that good-will which follows well-intended actions, and\r\ntheir approbation will be the dearest reward I can carry into retirement.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, my excellent friend, and give you yet many healthy and\r\nhappy years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HENING.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of December 26th, was received in due time. The only\r\nobject I had in making my collection of the laws of Virginia, was to save\r\nall those for the public which were not then already lost, in the hope\r\nthat at some future day they might be republished. Whether this be by\r\npublic or private enterprise, my end will be equally answered. The book\r\ndivides itself into two very distinct parts; to wit, the printed and\r\nthe unprinted laws. The former begin in 1682, (Pervis' collection.) My\r\ncollection of these is in strong volumes, well bound, and therefore may\r\nsafely be transported anywhere. Any of these volumes which you do not\r\npossess, are at your service for the purpose of republication, but the\r\nunprinted laws are dispersed through many MS. volumes, several of them so\r\ndecayed that the leaf can never be opened but once without falling into\r\npowder. These can never bear removal further than from their shelf to a\r\ntable. They are, as well as I recollect, from 1622 downwards. I formerly\r\nmade such a digest of their order, and the volumes where they are to be\r\nfound, that, under my own superintendence, they could be copied with once\r\nhandling. More they would not bear. Hence the impracticability of their\r\nbeing copied but at Monticello. But independent of them, the printed laws,\r\nbeginning in 1682, with all our former printed collections, will be a most\r\nvaluable publication, and sufficiently distinct. I shall have no doubt of\r\nthe exactness of your part of the work, but I hope you will take measures\r\nfor having the typography and paper worthy of the work. I am lead to this\r\ncaution by the scandalous volume of our laws printed by Pleasants in 1803,\r\nand those by Davis in 1796 were little better; both unworthy the history\r\nof Tom Thumb. You can have them better and cheaper printed anywhere north\r\nof Richmond. Accept my salutations and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL CLARKE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have examined the papers you left with me on the claim to the\r\ncommon of New Orleans, and finding the subject to be within the cognizance\r\nof the Board of Commissioners for that territory, they will be immediately\r\ninstructed to make full inquiry into the foundation of the claim, and to\r\nreport it for the decision of Congress.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the lots and buildings in the city of New Orleans, held by\r\nthe public, the Governor will be immediately instructed to report an exact\r\nlist of them, stating the uses to which they were applied under the former\r\ngovernment, and those for which he thinks them proper at present, which\r\nshall be laid before Congress at their next session, the Legislature alone\r\nbeing competent to their final disposition.\r\n\r\nI have lodged in the Treasury Office the papers you left with me; but\r\nif you wish their return, they will there be delivered to you. Accept my\r\nsalutations and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SHEE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of the 16th ult. was duly received, conveying a tender\r\nof the Philadelphia republican militia legion, of their voluntary\r\nservices, against either foreign or domestic foes. The pressure of\r\nbusiness, usual at this season, has prevented its earlier acknowledgment,\r\nand the return of my thanks, on the public behalf, for this example of\r\npatriotic spirit. Always a friend to peace, and believing it to promote\r\neminently the happiness and prosperity of nations, I am ever unwilling\r\nthat it should be disturbed, until greater and more important interests\r\ncall for an appeal to force. Whenever that shall take place, I feel a\r\nperfect confidence that the energy and enterprise displayed by my fellow\r\ncitizens in the pursuits of peace, will be equally eminent in those of\r\nwar. The Legislature have now under consideration, in what manner, and\r\nto what extent, the executive may be permitted to accept the service of\r\nvolunteers, should the public peace be disturbed, either from without or\r\nwithin. In whatever way they shall give that authority, the legion may be\r\nassured that no unreasonable use shall be made of the proffer which their\r\nlaudable zeal has prompted them to make. With my just acknowledgments\r\nto them, I pray you to accept personally the assurance of my high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your letter of December 24th, conveying a\r\ntender, by the officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates of the\r\nSaratoga Rangers, of their voluntary services to support the Constitution,\r\nlaws, and integrity of our country, when the constitutional authorities\r\nshall declare it necessary, and I now, on the public behalf, return them\r\nthanks for this example of patriotic spirit. Always a friend to peace,\r\nand believing it to promote eminently the happiness and prosperity of\r\nmankind, I am ever unwilling that it should be disturbed until greater and\r\nmore imperious interests call for an appeal to force. Whenever that shall\r\ntake place, I feel a perfect confidence that the energy and enterprise\r\ndisplayed by my fellow citizens in the pursuits of peace, will be equally\r\neminent in those of war. The Legislature have now under consideration, in\r\nwhat manner, and to what extent, the executive may be permitted to accept\r\nthe service of volunteers, should the public peace be disturbed either\r\nfrom without or within. In whatever way they shall give that authority,\r\nthe Saratoga Rangers may be assured that no unreasonable use shall be made\r\nof the proffer which their laudable zeal has prompted them to make. With\r\nmy acknowledgments to them, I pray you to accept personally the assurance\r\nof my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received two days ago a letter from General Wilkinson, dated\r\nat New Orleans, December 14th, in which he enclosed me an affidavit, of\r\nwhich I now transmit you a copy. You will perceive that it authenticates\r\nthe copy of a letter from Colonel Burr to the General, affirming that\r\nMr. Alston, his son-in-law, is engaged in the unlawful enterprises he is\r\ncarrying on, and is to be an actor in them. I am to add, also, that I have\r\nreceived information from another source, that Mr. Alston, while returning\r\nfrom Kentucky last autumn through the upper part of your State, proposed\r\nto a Mr. Butler of that part of the country, to join in Colonel Burr's\r\nenterprise, which he represented as of a nature to make his fortune, and\r\nis understood to have been explained as against Mexico, as well as for\r\nseparating the Union of these States. That Butler communicated this to a\r\nperson, of the same part of the country, called Span, who communicated it\r\nto a Mr. Horan, the clerk of a court in that quarter; that Butler and Span\r\nagreed to join in the enterprise, but Horan refused.\r\n\r\nNobody is a better judge than yourself whether any and what measures can\r\nbe taken on this information. As to General Wilkinson's affidavit, it\r\nwill be laid before the Legislature in a few days, and, of course, will\r\nbe public; but as to the other part, if no use can be made of it, your\r\nown discretion and candor would lead you to keep it secret. It is further\r\nwell known here that Mr. Alston is an endorser to a considerable amount,\r\nof the bills which have enabled Colonel Burr to prepare his treasons. A\r\nmessage which I shall send into the Legislature two days hence, will give\r\na development of them. I avail myself with pleasure of this opportunity of\r\nrecalling myself to your recollection, and of assuring you of my constant\r\nesteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 24, 1807.\r\n\r\nSeveral French vessels of war, disabled from keeping the sea, by the\r\nstorms which some time since took place on our coast, put into the\r\nharbors of the United States to avoid the danger of shipwreck. The\r\nMinister of their nation states that their crews are without resources\r\nfor subsistence, and other necessaries, for the reimbursement of which he\r\noffers bills on his government, the faith of which he pledges for their\r\npunctual payment.\r\n\r\nThe laws of humanity make it a duty for nations, as well as individuals,\r\nto succor those whom accident and distress have thrown upon them. By\r\ndoing this in the present case, to the extent of mere _subsistence and\r\nnecessaries_, and so as to aid no military equipment, we shall keep within\r\nthe duties of rigorous neutrality, which never can be in opposition to\r\nthose of humanity. We furnished, on a former occasion, to a distressed\r\ncrew of the other belligerent party, similar accommodations, and we have\r\nourselves received, from both those powers, friendly and free supplies\r\nto the necessities of our vessels of war in their Mediterranean ports.\r\nIn fact, the governments of civilized nations generally are in the\r\npractice of exercising these offices of humanity towards each other. Our\r\ngovernment having as yet made no regular provision for the exchange of\r\nthese offices of courtesy and humanity between nations, the honor, the\r\ninterest, and the duty of our country requires that we should adopt any\r\nother mode by which it may legally be done on the present occasion. It\r\nis expected that we shall want a large sum of money in Europe, for the\r\npurposes of the present negotiation with Spain, and besides this we want\r\nannually large sums there, for the discharge of our instalments of debt.\r\nUnder these circumstances, supported by the unanimous opinion of the heads\r\nof departments, given on the 15th of December, and again about the 10th\r\ninst., and firmly trusting that the government of France will feel itself\r\npeculiarly interested in the punctual discharge of the bills drawn by\r\ntheir Minister, for the sole subsistence of their people, I approve of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury's taking the bills of the Minister of France,\r\nto an amount not exceeding sixty thousand dollars, which according to his\r\nown, as well as our estimate, will subsist his people until he will have\r\nhad time to be furnished with funds from his own government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                        January 31st, 1807.\r\n\r\nSatisfied that New Orleans must fall a prey to any power which shall\r\nattack it, in spite of any means we now possess, I see no security for it\r\nbut in planting on the spot the force which is to defend it. I therefore\r\nsuggest to some members of the Senate to add to the volunteer bill now\r\nbefore them, as an amendment, some such section as that enclosed, which\r\nis on the principles of what we agreed on last year, except the omission\r\nof the two years' service. If, by giving one hundred miles square of that\r\ncountry, we can secure the rest, and at the same time create an American\r\nmajority before Orleans becomes a State, it will be the best bargain ever\r\nmade. As you are intimate with the details of the Land Office, I will\r\nthank you to make any amendments to the enclosed in that part, or in any\r\nother which you may think needs it. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                Sunday, February 1st, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe more I consider the letter of our minister in London, the more\r\nseriously it impresses me. I believe the _sine quâ non_ we made is that of\r\nthe nation, and that they would rather go on without a treaty than with\r\none which does not settle this article. Under this dilemma, and at this\r\nstage of the business, had we not better take the advice of the Senate? I\r\nask a meeting at eleven o'clock to-morrow, to consult on this question.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. D. GOVERNOR TIFFIN.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 2d, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The pressure of business during a session of the Legislature has\r\nrendered me more tardy in addressing you than it was my wish to have been.\r\nThat our fellow citizens of the West would need only to be informed of\r\ncriminal machinations against the public safety to crush them at once, I\r\nnever entertained a doubt. I have seen with the greatest satisfaction that\r\namong those who have distinguished themselves by their fidelity to their\r\ncountry, on the occasion of the enterprise of Mr. Burr, yourself and the\r\nLegislature of Ohio have been the most eminent. The promptitude and energy\r\ndisplayed by your State has been as honorable to itself as salutary to\r\nits sister States; and in declaring that you have deserved well of your\r\ncountry, I do but express the grateful sentiment of every faithful citizen\r\nin it. The hand of the people has given the mortal blow to a conspiracy\r\nwhich, in other countries, would have called for an appeal to armies, and\r\nhas proved that government to be the strongest of which every man feels\r\nhimself a part. It is a happy illustration, too, of the importance of\r\npreserving to the State authorities all that vigor which the Constitution\r\nforesaw would be necessary, not only for their own safety, but for that\r\nof the whole. In making these acknowledgments of the merit of having\r\nset this illustrious example of exertion for the common safety, I pray\r\nthat they may be considered as addressed to yourself and the Legislature\r\nparticularly, and generally to every citizen who has availed himself of\r\nthe opportunity given of proving his devotion to his country. Accept my\r\nsalutations and assurances of great consideration and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 3d, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--A returning express gives me an opportunity of acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of your letters of November 12th, December 9th, 10th, 14th, 18th,\r\n25th, 26th, and January 2d. I wrote to you January 3d, and through Mr.\r\nBriggs, January 10th. The former being written while the Secretary at War\r\nwas unable to attend to business, gave you the state of the information\r\nwe then possessed as to Burr's conspiracy. I now enclose you a message,\r\ncontaining a complete history of it from the commencement down to the\r\neve of his departure from Nashville; and two subsequent messages showed\r\nthat he began his descent of the Mississippi January 1st, with ten boats,\r\nfrom eighty to one hundred men of his party, navigated by sixty oarsmen\r\nnot at all of his party. This, I think, is fully the force with which he\r\nwill be able to meet your gun-boats; and as I think he was uninformed of\r\nyour proceedings, and could not get the information till he would reach\r\nNatchez, I am in hopes that before this date he is in your possession.\r\nAlthough we at no time believed he could carry any formidable force out\r\nof the Ohio, yet we thought it safest that you should be prepared to\r\nreceive him with all the force which could be assembled, and with that\r\nview our orders were given; and we were pleased to see that without\r\nwaiting for them, you adopted nearly the same plan yourself, and acted\r\non it with promptitude; the difference between yours and ours proceeding\r\nfrom your expecting an attack by sea, which we knew was impossible, either\r\nby England or by a fleet under Truxton, who was at home; or by our own\r\nnavy, which was under our own eye. Your belief that Burr would really\r\ndescend with six or seven thousand men, was no doubt founded on what you\r\nknew of the numbers which could be raised in the Western country for an\r\nexpedition to Mexico, _under the authority of the government_; but you\r\nprobably did not calculate that the want of that authority would take\r\nfrom him every honest man, and leave him only the desperadoes of his\r\nparty, which in no part of the United States can ever be a numerous body.\r\nIn approving, therefore, as we do approve, of the defensive operations\r\nfor New Orleans, we are obliged to estimate them, not according to our\r\nown view of the danger, but to place ourselves in your situation, and\r\nonly with your information. Your sending here Swartwout and Bollman, and\r\nadding to them Burr, Blannerhassett, and Tyler, should they fall into\r\nyour hands, will be supported by the public opinion. As to Alexander,\r\nwho is arrived, and Ogden, expected, the evidence yet received will not\r\nbe sufficient to commit them. I hope, however, you will not extend this\r\ndeportation to persons against whom there is only suspicion, or shades of\r\noffence not strongly marked. In that case, I fear the public sentiment\r\nwould desert you; because, seeing no danger here, violations of law are\r\nfelt with strength. I have thought it just to give you these views of\r\nthe sentiments and sensations here, as they may enlighten your path. I\r\nam thoroughly sensible of the painful difficulties of your situation,\r\nexpecting an attack from an overwhelming force, unversed in law,\r\nsurrounded by suspected persons, and in a nation tender as to everything\r\ninfringing liberty, and especially from the military. You have doubtless\r\nseen a good deal of malicious insinuation in the papers against you.\r\nThis, of course, begot suspicion and distrust in those acquainted with\r\nthe line of your conduct. We, who knew it, have not failed to strengthen\r\nthe public confidence in you; and I can assure you that your conduct, as\r\nnow known, has placed you on ground extremely favorable with the public.\r\nBurr and his emissaries found it convenient to sow a distrust in your\r\nmind of our dispositions towards you; but be assured that you will be\r\ncordially supported in the line of your duties. I pray you to send me D.'s\r\noriginal letter, communicated through Briggs, by the first entirely safe\r\nconveyance. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 3, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I pray you to read the enclosed letter, to seal and deliver\r\nit. It explains itself so fully, that I need say nothing. I am sincerely\r\nconcerned for Mr. Reibelt, who is a man of excellent understanding\r\nand extensive science. If you had any academical berth, he would be\r\nmuch better fitted for that than for the bustling business of life.\r\nI enclose to General Wilkinson my message of January 22d. I presume,\r\nhowever, you will have seen it in the papers. It gives the history of\r\nBurr's conspiracy, all but the last chapter, which will, I hope, be\r\nthat of his capture before this time, at Natchez. Your situations have\r\nbeen difficult, and we judge of the merit of our agents there by the\r\nmagnitude of the danger as it appeared to them, not as it was known to\r\nus. On great occasions every good officer must be ready to risk himself\r\nin going beyond the strict line of law, when the public preservation\r\nrequires it; his motives will be a justification as far as there is any\r\ndiscretion in his ultra-legal proceedings, and no indulgence of private\r\nfeelings. On the whole, this squall, by showing with what ease our\r\ngovernment suppresses movements which in other countries requires armies,\r\nhas greatly increased its strength by increasing the public confidence in\r\nit. It has been a wholesome lesson too to our citizens, of the necessary\r\nobedience to their government. The Feds, and the little band of Quids,\r\nin opposition, will try to make something of the infringement of liberty\r\nby the military arrest and deportation of citizens, but if it does not go\r\nbeyond such offenders as Swartwout, Bollman, Burr, Blennerhasset, Tyler,\r\n&c., they will be supported by the public approbation. Accept my friendly\r\nsalutations, and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                          February 6, 1807.\r\n\r\nA resolution of the House of Representatives of yesterday, asks from me\r\ninformation as to the efficacy of the gun-boat defence, what particular\r\nports we propose to place them in, and how many in each. I will enumerate\r\nthe particular ports, but instead of saying literally how many to each, on\r\nwhich there would be a thousand opinions, I will throw them into groups as\r\nbelow, and say how many to each group. Will you be so good as to state how\r\nmany you would think necessary for each of the ports below mentioned, to\r\ngive then such a degree of protection as you think would be sufficiently\r\neffectual in time of war? Also to strike out any of the ports here named,\r\nand insert others as you shall think best:\r\n\r\n      Mississippi river, }\r\n      Lake Ponchartrain, }\r\n      Savannah,          }\r\n      Beaufort,          }\r\n      Charleston,        }\r\n      Cape Fear,         }\r\n      Ocracock,          }\r\n\r\n      Chesapeake Bay and water,\r\n\r\n      Delaware Bay,\r\n\r\n      New York,   }\r\n      New London, }\r\n      Newport,    }\r\n\r\n      Boston,     }\r\n      Newburyport,}\r\n      Portsmouth, }\r\n      Portland,   }\r\n      Kennebeck,  }\r\n      Penobscot,  }\r\n\r\n      Passamaquoddy.\r\n\r\nSend me also, if you please, copies of the opinions of certain officers\r\non the effect of gun-boats, which I believe, were formerly laid before a\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nA similar note in substance was sent to General Dearborne.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          February 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the case in the Siman Sea, which escaped my recollection.\r\nIt was indeed a very favorable one. I have adopted your other amendments,\r\nexcept as to the not building _now_; my own opinion being very strongly\r\nagainst this for these reasons: 1st. The 127 gun-boats cannot be built\r\nin one, two, or even six months. Commodore Preble told me he could\r\nbuild those he undertook, in two months. They were but four, and though\r\nhe was preparing during the winter, was engaged in April, and pressed\r\nto expedite them, they were not ready for sea till November. 2d. After\r\nwar commences they cannot be built in New York, Boston, Norfolk, or any\r\nseaport, because they would be destroyed by the enemy, on the stocks.\r\nThey could then be built only in interior places, inaccessible to ships\r\nand defended by the body of the country, where the building would be\r\nslow. 3d. The first operation of war by an enterprising enemy would be\r\nto sweep all our seaports, of their vessels at least. 4th. The expense\r\nof their preservation would be all but nothing, because I have had the\r\nopinion of, I believe, every captain of the navy, that the largest of our\r\ngun-boats can be drawn up, out of the water, and placed under a shed with\r\ngreat ease, by preparing ways and capstans proper for it, and always ready\r\nto let her down again. Such of them as are built in suitable places may\r\nremain on the stocks unlaunched. 5th. Full the half of the whole number\r\nwould be small, and not costing more than three-fifths of the large ones.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS SEYMOUR, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The mass of business which occurs during a session of the\r\nLegislature, renders me necessarily unpunctual in acknowledging the\r\nreceipt of letters, and in answering those which will admit of delay.\r\nThis must be my apology for being so late in noticing the receipt of the\r\nletter of December 20th, addressed to me by yourself, and several other\r\nrepublican characters of your State of high respectability. I have seen\r\nwith deep concern the afflicting oppression under which the republican\r\ncitizens of Connecticut suffer from an unjust majority. The truths\r\nexpressed in your letter have been long exposed to the nation through the\r\nchannel of the public papers, and are the more readily believed because\r\nmost of the States during the momentary ascendancy of kindred majorities,\r\nin them have seen the same spirit of opposition prevail.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the countervailing prosecutions now instituted in the\r\nCourt of the United States in Connecticut, I had heard but little, and\r\ncertainly, I believe, never expressed a sentiment on them. That a spirit\r\nof indignation and retaliation should arise when an opportunity should\r\npresent itself, was too much within the human constitution to excite\r\neither surprise or censure, and confined to an appeal to truth only, it\r\ncannot lessen the useful freedom of the press.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, conscious that there was not a _truth_ on earth which I\r\nfeared should be known, I have lent myself willingly as the subject of a\r\ngreat experiment, which was to prove that an administration, conducting\r\nitself with integrity and common understanding, cannot be battered down,\r\neven by the falsehoods of a licentious press, and consequently still\r\nless by the press, as restrained within the legal and wholesome limits\r\nof truth. This experiment was wanting for the world to demonstrate\r\nthe falsehood of the pretext that freedom of the press is incompatible\r\nwith orderly government. I have never therefore even contradicted the\r\nthousands of calumnies so industriously propagated against myself. But\r\nthe fact being once established, that the press is impotent when it\r\nabandons itself to falsehood, I leave to others to restore it to its\r\nstrength, by recalling it within the pale of truth. Within that it is a\r\nnoble institution, equally the friend of science and of civil liberty.\r\nIf this can once be effected in your State, I trust we shall soon see\r\nits citizens rally to the republican principles of our Constitution,\r\nwhich unite their sister-States into one family. It would seem impossible\r\nthat an intelligent people, with the faculty of reading and right of\r\nthinking, should continue much longer to slumber under the pupilage of\r\nan interested aristocracy of priests and lawyers, persuading them to\r\ndistrust themselves, and to let them think for them. I sincerely wish that\r\nyour efforts may awaken them from this voluntary degradation of mind,\r\nrestore them to a due estimate of themselves and their fellow-citizens,\r\nand a just abhorrence of the falsehoods and artifices which have seduced\r\nthem. Experience of the use made by federalism of whatever comes from me,\r\nobliges me to suggest the caution of considering my letter as private. I\r\npray you to present me respectfully to the other gentlemen who joined in\r\nthe letter to me, and to whom this is equally addressed, and to accept\r\nyourself my salutations, and assurances of great esteem and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                         February 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson salutes General Dearborne with friendship, and\r\ncommunicates the following information from Captain Lewis, which may be\r\nuseful to Colonel Freeman, and our future explorers; and indeed may enable\r\nus understandingly to do acceptable things to our Louisiana neighbors when\r\nwe wish to gratify them.\r\n\r\nHe says the following are the articles in highest value with them:\r\n\r\n1. _Blue_ beads. This is a coarse cheap bead imported from China, and\r\ncosting in England 13d. the pound, in strands. It is far more valued by\r\nthe Indians than the _white_ beads of the same manufacture, and answers\r\nall the purposes of money, being counted by the fathom. He says that were\r\nhis journey to be performed again, one-half or two-thirds of his stores\r\n_in value_ should be of these.\r\n\r\n2. Common brass buttons, more valued than anything except beads.\r\n\r\n3. Knives.\r\n\r\n4. Battleaxes and tomahawks.\r\n\r\n5. Sadlers' seat awls, which answer for moccasin awls.\r\n\r\n6. Some glovers' needles.\r\n\r\n7. Some iron combs.\r\n\r\n8. Some nests of camp kettles; brass is much preferred to iron, though\r\nboth are very useful to the Indians.\r\n\r\nArrow-points should have been added.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NICHOLSON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I did not receive your letter of the 18th till this morning. I\r\nam as yet in possession of no evidence against Adair, which could convict\r\nhim. General Wilkinson writes me that he would send the evidence against\r\nhim and Ogden by the officer bringing them, and that officer informed\r\nGeneral Dearborne (from Baltimore) that he was in possession of a large\r\npacket from General Wilkinson to me, which he was ordered to deliver into\r\nmy hands only; and, on that, he was ordered to come on with his prisoners,\r\nthat they and the evidence against them might be delivered up to the court\r\nhere. If the evidence, however, be found conclusive, they can be arrested\r\nagain, if it shall be worth while. Their crimes are defeated, and whether\r\nthey shall be punished or not belongs to another department, and is not\r\nthe subject of even a wish on my part. Accept my friendly salutations, and\r\nassurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WISTAR.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 25, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a letter from Dr. Goforth on the subject of the\r\nbones of the mammoth. Immediately on the receipt of this, as I found it\r\nwas in my power to accomplish the wishes of the society for the completion\r\nof this skeleton with more certainty than through the channel proposed\r\nin the letter, I set the thing into motion, so that it will be effected\r\nwithout any expense to the society, or other trouble than to indicate\r\nthe particular bones wanting. Being acquainted with Mr. Ross, proprietor\r\nof the big bone lick, I wrote to him for permission to search for such\r\nparticular bones as the society might desire, and I expect to receive it\r\nin a few days. Captain Clarke (companion of Captain Lewis) who is now\r\nhere, agrees, as he passes through that country, to stop at the Lick,\r\nemploy laborers, and superintend the search at my expense, not that of\r\nthe society, and to send me the specific bones wanted, without further\r\ntrespassing on the deposit, about which Mr. Ross would be tender, and\r\nparticularly where he apprehended that the person employed would wish to\r\ncollect for himself. If therefore you will be so good as to send me a list\r\nof the bones wanting (the one you formerly sent me having been forwarded\r\nto Dr. Brown), the business shall be effected without encroaching at all\r\non the funds of the society, and it will be particularly gratifying to me\r\nto have the opportunity of being of some use to them. But send me the list\r\nif you please without any delay, as Captain Clarke returns in a few days,\r\nand we should lose the opportunity. I send you a paper from Dr. Thornton\r\nfor the society. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CHANDLER PRICE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 24th was received this morning. The greatest favor\r\nwhich can be done me is the communication of the opinions of judicious\r\nmen, of men who do not suffer their judgments to be biassed by either\r\ninterests or passions. Of this character, I know Mr. Morgan to be. I\r\nreturn you the original of the letter of January 15th, having copied it\r\nto a mark in the 4th page, which you will see. I retain, as I understand,\r\nwith your permission, the copies of those of January 22d and 27th, because\r\nthey are copies; and the original of December 31st, because it relates\r\nwholly to public matters. They shall be sacredly reserved to myself,\r\nand for my own information only. The fortification of New Orleans will\r\nbe taken up on a sufficient footing; but the other part of Mr. Morgan's\r\nwish, an additional regular force, will not prevail. The spirit of\r\nthis country is totally adverse to a large military force. I have tried\r\nfor two sessions to prevail on the Legislature to let me plant thirty\r\nthousand well chosen volunteers on donation lands on the west side of the\r\nMississippi, as a militia always at hand for the defence of New Orleans;\r\nbut I have not yet succeeded. The opinion grows, and will perhaps ripen\r\nby the next session. A great security for that country is, that there is\r\na moral certainty that neither France nor England would meddle with that\r\ncountry, while the present state of Europe continues, and Spain we fear\r\nnot. Accept my salutations, and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE KING OF HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n                                                         February 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nGREAT AND GOOD FRIEND,--Having received your letter of September last,\r\nwhich notifies your accession to the throne of Holland, I tender you in\r\nbehalf of the United States my congratulations on this event. Connected\r\nwith that nation by the earliest ties of friendship, and maintaining\r\nwith them uninterrupted relations of peace and commerce, no event which\r\ninterests their welfare can be indifferent to us. It is therefore with\r\ngreat pleasure I receive the assurances of your majesty that you will\r\ncontinue to cherish these ancient relations; and we shall, on our part,\r\nendeavor to strengthen your good will by a faithful observance of justice,\r\nand by all the good offices which occasion shall permit. Distant as we\r\nare from the powers of Europe, and devoted to pursuits which separate\r\nus from their affairs, we still look with brotherly concern on whatever\r\naffects those nations, and offer constant prayers for their welfare. With\r\na friendly solicitude for your Majesty's person, I pray God, that he may\r\nalways have you, great and good friend, in His holy keeping. Done, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of January the 20th was received in due time. But\r\nsuch has been the constant pressure of business, that it has been out of\r\nmy power to answer it. Indeed, the subjects of it would be almost beyond\r\nthe extent of a letter, and as I hope to see you ere long at Monticello,\r\nit can then be more effectually done verbally. Let me observe, however,\r\ngenerally, that it is impossible for my friends ever to render me so\r\nacceptable a favor, as by communicating to me, without reserve, facts\r\nand opinions. I have none of that sort of self-love which winces at it;\r\nindeed, both self-love and the desire to do what is best, strongly invite\r\nunreserved communication. There is one subject which will not admit a\r\ndelay till I see you. Mr. T. M. Randolph is, I believe, determined to\r\nretire from Congress, and it is strongly his wish, and that of all here,\r\nthat you should take his place. Never did the calls of patriotism more\r\nloudly assail you than at this moment. After excepting the federalists,\r\nwho will be twenty-seven, and the little band of schismatics, who will be\r\nthree or four (all tongue), the residue of the House of Representatives\r\nis as well disposed a body of men as I ever saw collected. But there is no\r\none whose talents and standing, taken together, have weight enough to give\r\nhim the lead. The consequence is, that there is no one who will undertake\r\nto do the public business, and it remains undone. Were you here, the whole\r\nwould rally round you in an instant, and willingly co-operate in whatever\r\nis for the public good. Nor would it require you to undertake drudgery\r\nin the House. There are enough, able and willing to do that. A rallying\r\npoint is all that is wanting. Let me beseech you then to offer yourself.\r\nYou never will have it so much in your power again to render such eminent\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations and high esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                             March 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mr. Bloodworth, our first duty is to save the public\r\nfrom loss; the second, to aid the securities in saving themselves. They\r\nhave not asked a dismission, which would probably do them injury, but an\r\nexamination. I should think it equally safe for the public, and better for\r\nthe securities, to send them a dismission of the collector, to be used\r\nor not at their discretion. With this in their hand, they could compel\r\nhim to convey his property as a security to them, and to receive deputies\r\nof their appointment, who should apply all the future emoluments of the\r\ncollector, or a given part of them, towards making up the deficit. But\r\nin such case, faithful reports should be made to you from time to time,\r\nthat you may see that this operation is honestly going on, and no new\r\ndanger arising to the public. These ideas are submitted merely for your\r\nconsideration, as I am ready to sign a dismission as above proposed, or\r\nmake a new appointment at once, whichever you think best. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT BRENT, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received your letter of yesterday, asking the application of\r\na part of a late appropriation of Congress, to certain avenues and roads\r\nin this place.\r\n\r\nThe only appropriation ever before made by Congress to an object of\r\nthis nature, was \"to the public buildings and the highways _between_\r\nthem.\" This ground was deliberately taken, and I accordingly restrained\r\nthe application of the money to the avenue between the Capitol and the\r\nExecutive buildings, and the roads round the two squares.\r\n\r\nThe last appropriation was in terms much more lax, to wit, \"for avenues\r\nand roads in the District of Columbia.\" This, indeed, would take in a\r\nlarge field, but besides that we cannot suppose Congress intended to\r\ntax the people of the United States at large, for all the avenues in\r\nWashington and roads in Columbia; we know the fact to have been that\r\nthe expression was strongly objected to, and was saved merely from a\r\nwant of time to discuss, (the last day of the session,) and the fear of\r\nlosing the whole bill. But the sum appropriated (three thousand dollars)\r\nshows they did not mean it for so large a field; for by the time the\r\nPennsylvania avenue, between the two houses, is widened, newly gravelled,\r\nplanted, brick tunnels instead of wood, the roads round the squares put\r\nin order, and that in the south front of the war office dug down to its\r\nproper level, there will be no more of the three thousand dollars left\r\nthan will be wanting for constant repairs. With this view of the just and\r\nprobable intention of the Legislature, I shall not think myself authorized\r\nto take advantage of a lax expression, forced on by circumstances, to\r\ncarry the execution of the law into a region of expense which would merit\r\ngreat consideration before they should embark in it. Accept my friendly\r\nsalutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nI think with you it is better to leave the leasing the Salt Springs to\r\nGovernor Harrison, who will do it according to general rules; and I am\r\naverse to giving contracts of any kind to members of the Legislature. On\r\nthe subject of Latimer's letter, I gave him a general answer, that all\r\nindulgence permitted by the spirit of the law would be used. I am unable\r\nto give any particular opinion, because the law not having been printed\r\nyet, I cannot turn to it; but I am ready to approve any proposition you\r\nthink best. Indeed, I have but a little moment in the morning in which I\r\ncan either read, write, or think; being obliged to be shut up in a dark\r\nroom from early in the forenoon till night, with a periodical head-ache.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY, TENNESSEE, OHIO, AND MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Although the present state of things on the western side of the\r\nMississippi does not threaten any immediate collision with our neighbors\r\nin that quarter, and it is our wish they should remain undisturbed until\r\nan amicable adjustment may take place; yet as this does not depend on\r\nourselves alone, it has been thought prudent to be prepared to meet any\r\nmovements which may occur. The law of a former session of Congress, for\r\nkeeping a body of 100,000 militia in readiness for service at a moment's\r\nwarning, is still in force. But by an act of the last session, a copy of\r\nwhich I now enclose, the Executive is authorized to accept the services of\r\nsuch volunteers as shall offer themselves on the conditions of the act,\r\nwhich may render a resort to the former act unnecessary. It is for the\r\nexecution of this act that I am now to solicit your zealous endeavors. The\r\npersons who shall engage will not be called from their homes until some\r\naggression, committed or intended, shall render it necessary. When called\r\ninto action, it will not be for a lounging, but for an active, and perhaps\r\ndistant, service. I know the effect of this consideration in kindling that\r\nardor which prevails for this service, and I count on it for filling up\r\nthe numbers requisite without delay. To yourself, I am sure, it must be as\r\ndesirable as it is to me, to transfer this service from the great mass of\r\nour militia to that portion of them, to whose habits and enterprise active\r\nand distant service is most congenial. In using, therefore, your best\r\nexertions towards accomplishing the object of this act, you will render to\r\nyour constituents, as well as to the nation, a most acceptable service.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the organizing and officering those who shall be\r\nengaged within your State, the act itself will be your guide; and as it\r\nis desirable that we should be kept informed of the progress in this\r\nbusiness, I must pray you to report the same from time to time to the\r\nSecretary at War, who will correspond with you on all the details arising\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A copy of the treaty with Great Britain came to Mr. Erskine's\r\nhands on the last day of the session of Congress, which he immediately\r\ncommunicated to us; and since that Mr. Purviance has arrived with\r\nan original. On the subject of it you will receive a letter from the\r\nSecretary of State, of about this date, and one more in detail hereafter.\r\nI should not have written, but that I perceive uncommon efforts, and\r\nwith uncommon wickedness, are making by the federal papers to produce\r\nmischief between myself, personally, and our negotiators; and also to\r\nirritate the British government, by putting a thousand speeches into my\r\nmouth, not one word of which I ever uttered. I have, therefore, thought\r\nit safe to guard you, by stating the view which we have given out on the\r\nsubject of the treaty, in conversation and otherwise; for ours, as you\r\nknow, is a government which will not tolerate the being kept entirely in\r\nthe dark, and especially on a subject so interesting as this treaty. We\r\nimmediately stated in conversation, to the members of the Legislature and\r\nothers, that having, by a letter received in January, perceived that our\r\nministers might sign a treaty not providing satisfactorily against the\r\nimpressment of our seamen, we had, on the 3d of February, informed you,\r\nthat should such an one have been forwarded, it could not be ratified,\r\nand recommending, therefore that you should resume negotiations for\r\ninserting an article to that effect; that we should hold the treaty in\r\nsuspense until we could learn from you the result of our instructions,\r\nwhich probably would not be till summer, and then decide on the question\r\nof calling the Senate. We observed, too, that a written declaration of\r\nthe British commissioners, given in at the time of signature, would of\r\nitself, unless withdrawn, prevent the acceptance of any treaty, because\r\nits effect was to leave us bound by the treaty, and themselves totally\r\nunbound. This is the statement we have given out, and nothing more of the\r\ncontents of the treaty has ever been made known. But depend on it, my dear\r\nSir, that it will be considered as a hard treaty when it is known. The\r\nBritish commissioners appear to have screwed every article as far as it\r\nwould bear, to have taken everything, and yielded nothing. Take out the\r\neleventh article, and the evil of all the others so much overweighs the\r\ngood, that we should be glad to expunge the whole. And even the eleventh\r\narticle admits only that we may enjoy our right to the indirect colonial\r\ntrade, _during the present hostilities_. If peace is made this year, and\r\nwar resumed the next, the benefit of this stipulation is gone, and yet\r\nwe are bound for ten years, to pass no non-importation or non-intercourse\r\nlaws, nor take any other measures to restrain the unjust pretensions and\r\npractices of the British. But on this you will hear from the Secretary of\r\nState. If the treaty can not be put into acceptable form, then the next\r\nbest thing is to back out of the negotiation as well as we can, letting\r\nthat die away insensibly; but, in the meantime, agreeing informally, that\r\nboth parties shall act on the principles of the treaty, so as to preserve\r\nthat friendly understanding which we sincerely desire, until the one or\r\nthe other may be deposed to yield the points which divide us. This will\r\nleave you to follow your desire of coming home, as soon as you see that\r\nthe amendment of the treaty is desperate. The power of continuing the\r\nnegotiations will pass over to Mr. Pinckney, who, by procrastinations, can\r\nlet it die away, and give us time, the most precious of all things to us.\r\nThe government of New Orleans is still without such a head as I wish. The\r\nsalary of five thousand dollars is too small; but I am assured the Orleans\r\nlegislature would make it adequate, would you accept it. It is the second\r\noffice in the United States in importance, and I am still in hopes you\r\nwill accept it. It is impossible to let you stay at home while the public\r\nhas so much need of talents. I am writing under a severe indisposition of\r\nperiodical headache, without scarcely command enough of my mind to know\r\nwhat I write. As a part of this letter concerns Mr. Pinckney as well as\r\nyourself, be so good as to communicate so much of it to him; and with\r\nmy best respects to him, to Mrs. Monroe and your daughter, be assured\r\nyourself, in all cases, of my constant and affectionate friendship and\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, March 24th, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The two receipts of Poncin's have come safely to hand. The\r\naccount had been settled without difficulty. The federal papers appear\r\ndesirous of making mischief between us and England, by putting speeches\r\ninto my mouth which I never uttered. Perceiving, by a letter received\r\nin January, that our commissioners were making up their mind to sign a\r\ntreaty which contained no provision against impressment, we immediately\r\ninstructed them not to do so; and if done, to consider the treaty as not\r\naccepted, and to resume their negociations to supply an article against\r\nimpressment. We therefore hold the treaty in suspense, until we hear what\r\nis done in consequence of our last instructions. Probably we shall not\r\nhear till midsummer, and we reserve till that time the question of calling\r\nthe Senate. In the meantime, to show the continuance of a friendly spirit,\r\nwe continue the suspension of the non-importation act by proclamation.\r\nAnother cause for not accepting the treaty was a written declaration by\r\nthe British commissioner, at the time of signing, reserving a right, if\r\nwe did not oppose the French decree to their satisfaction, to retaliate\r\nin their own way, however it might affect the treaty; so that, in fact,\r\nwe were to be bound, and they left free. I think, upon the whole, the\r\nemperor cannot be dissatisfied at the present state of things between us\r\nand England, and that he must rather be satisfied at our unhesitating\r\nrejection of a proposition to make common cause against him, for such\r\nin amount it was. Burr has indeed made a most inglorious exhibition of\r\nhis much over-rated talents. He is now on his way to Richmond for trial.\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of constant esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, March 25th, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,-- * * * * * Burr is on his way to Richmond for trial. No man's\r\nhistory proves better the value of honesty. With that, what might he\r\nnot have been! I expect you are at a loss to understand the situation\r\nof the British treaty, on which the newspapers make so many speeches for\r\nme which I never made. It is exactly this. By a letter received from our\r\nnegotiators in January, we found they were making up their minds to sign\r\na treaty containing no provision against the impressment of our seamen.\r\nWe instantly (February 3d) instructed them not to do so; and that if such\r\na treaty had been forwarded, it could not be ratified; that therefore\r\nthey must immediately resume the negociations to supply that defect,\r\nas a _sine quâ non_. Such a treaty having come to hand, we of course\r\nsuspend it, until we know the result of the instructions of February 3d,\r\nwhich probably will not be till midsummer. We reserve ourselves till\r\nthen to decide the question of calling the Senate. In the meantime, I\r\nhave, by proclamation continued the suspension of the non-importation\r\nlaw, as a proof of the continuance of friendly dispositions. There was\r\nanother circumstance which would have prevented the acceptance of the\r\ntreaty. The British commissioners, at the time of signing, gave in a\r\nwritten declaration, that until they knew what we meant to do in the\r\nsubject of the French decree, the king reserved to himself the right of\r\nnot ratifying, and of taking any measures retaliating on France which\r\nhe should deem proper, notwithstanding the treaty. This made the treaty\r\nbinding on us; while he was loose to regard it or not, and clearly\r\nsquinted at the expectation that we should join in resistance to France,\r\nor they would not regard the treaty. We rejected this idea unhesitatingly.\r\n\r\nI expected to have paid a short visit to Monticello before this, but have\r\nbeen detained by the illness of my son-in-law, Mr. Randolph, and now by\r\nan attack of periodical headache on myself. This leaves me but an hour\r\nand a half each morning capable of any business at all. A part of this I\r\nhave devoted to write you this letter, and to assure you of my constant\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL G. MORGAN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, March 26th, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favors of January 19th and 20th came to hand in due time, but\r\nit was not in my power to acknowledge their receipt during the session\r\nof Congress. General Gage's paper I have filed with that on Pensacola,\r\nin the War Office, and Mr. Hutchins' map, in the Navy Office, where they\r\nwill be useful. I tender you my thanks for this contribution to the public\r\nservice. The bed of the Mississippi and the shoals on the coast change\r\nso frequently, as to require frequent renewals of the surveys. Congress\r\nhave authorized a new survey of our whole coast, by an act of the last\r\nsession. Burr is on his way to Richmond for trial; and if the judges do\r\nnot discharge him before it is possible to collect the testimony from\r\nMaine to New Orleans, there can be no doubt where his history will end.\r\nTo what degree punishments of his adherents shall be extended, will be\r\ndecided when we shall have collected all the evidence, and seen who were\r\ncordially guilty. The federalists appear to make Burr's cause their own,\r\nand to spare no efforts to screen his adherents. Their great mortification\r\nis at the failure of his plans. Had a little success dawned on him, their\r\nopenly joining him might have produced some danger. As it is, I believe\r\nthe undertaking will not be without some good effects, as a wholesome\r\nlesson to those who have more ardor than principle. I believe there is\r\nreason to expect that Blennerhasset will also be sent by the judges of\r\nMississippi to Virginia. Yours was the very first intimation I had of this\r\nplot, for which it is but justice to say you have deserved well of your\r\ncountry. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. COXE.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 27, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received on the 24th of January a communication, which from an\r\nendorsement in your hand, I knew to have come from you. Others had been\r\nreceived at different periods before, which candor obliges me frankly\r\nto say, had not been answered because some of the earliest of them had\r\nbeen of a character with which I thought it my duty to be dissatisfied.\r\nObserving, however, that you have continued to turn your attention\r\nassiduously to the public interests, and to communicate to the government\r\nyour ideas, which have often been useful, I expunge from my mind the\r\numbrage which had been taken, and wish it no more to be recollected or\r\nexplained on either side.\r\n\r\nYour idea of providing as many arms as we have fighting men, is\r\nundoubtedly a sound one. Its execution, however, depends on the\r\nLegislature. Composed, indeed, of gentlemen of the best intentions, but\r\nlike all others collected in mass, requiring considerable time to receive\r\nimpressions, however useful, if new. Time and reflection will not fail in\r\nthe end to bring them to whatever is right. The session before the last I\r\nproposed to them the classification of the militia, so that those in the\r\nprime of life only, and unburthened with families, should ever be called\r\ninto distant service; and that every man should receive a stand of arms\r\nthe first year he entered the militia. This would have required 40,000\r\nstands a year, and in a few years would have armed the whole, besides\r\nthe stock in the public arsenals, which is a good one. Converts to the\r\nmeasure are daily coming over, and it will prevail in time. The same thing\r\nwill happen as to the employing the surplus of our revenues to roads,\r\nrivers, canals, education. The proposition for building lock-docks for\r\nthe preservation of our navy, has local rivalries to contend against. Till\r\nthese can be overruled or compromised, the measure can never be adopted.\r\nYet there ought never to be another ship built until we can provide some\r\nmethod of preserving them through the long intervals of peace which I hope\r\nare to be the lot of our country. I understand that, employing private as\r\nwell as the public manufactories, we can make about 40,000 stand of arms\r\na year. But they come so much dearer than the imported of equal quality,\r\nthat we shall import also. From the beginning of my administration, I have\r\ndiscouraged the laying in stores of powder, but have recommended great\r\nstores of sulphur and salt-petre. I confess, however, I do not apprehend\r\nthat the dislike which I know the European governments have to our form,\r\nwill combine them in any serious attempts against it. They have too\r\nmany jealousies of one another, to engage in distant wars for a matter\r\nof opinion only. I verily believe that it will ever be in our power to\r\nkeep so even a stand between England and France, as to inspire a wish in\r\nneither to throw us into the scale of his adversary. But if we can do this\r\nfor a dozen years only, we shall have little to fear from them. Accept my\r\nsalutations, and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVETT HARRIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letters of August 10th and September 18th have been duly\r\nreceived, and I have to thank you for the safe transmission of the four\r\nvolumes of the \"Vocabulaires Comparés de Pallas,\" for which I am indebted,\r\nthrough you, to the Minister of Commerce, Count Romanzoff. I must pray\r\nyou, in a particular manner, to express to his Excellency my sensibility\r\nfor this mark of his obliging attention, rendered the more impressive\r\nfrom a high esteem for his personal character, and from the hope that an\r\ninterchange of personal esteem may contribute to strengthen the friendship\r\nof the two nations, bound together by many similar interests. To this\r\nI must add by anticipation my thanks for his work on the Commerce of\r\nRussia, as well as to Count Potoski, for the two works from him, which you\r\nmention to have been sent by Mr. A. Smith, and which, I doubt not, will\r\ncome safely to hand. Accept for yourself my salutations and assurances of\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nA doubt is entertained whether the Acts of Congress respecting claims\r\nto lands in Orleans and Louisiana, and authorizing the commissioners\r\n\"to decide according to the laws and established usages and customs of\r\nthe French and Spanish governments, _upon all claims to lands within\r\ntheir respective districts_,\" &c., meant to give that power as to _all\r\nclaims_, or to restrict it to those claims only which had been previously\r\nrecognized by Congress.\r\n\r\nWere it necessary for us to decide that question, I should be of opinion\r\nthat it meant _all claims_, because the words are general. \"_All claims\r\nto lands within their respective districts_,\" and there are no other words\r\nrestricting them to those claims only, previously recognized by Congress;\r\nand because the intention of the Act was to quiet and satisfy all the\r\nminor claimants, and reserve only the great and fraudulent speculations\r\nfor rigorous examination.\r\n\r\nBut the Board of Commissioners, being a judiciary tribunal, I should think\r\nit proper to leave them to the law itself, as their instructions, on the\r\nmeaning of which they are competent to decide, and, being on the spot, are\r\nbetter informed of the nature of those claims than we are. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nMany officers of the army being involved in the offence of intending a\r\nmilitary enterprise against a nation at peace with the United States,\r\nto remove the whole without trial, by the paramount authority of the\r\nexecutive, would be a proceeding of unusual severity. Some line must\r\ntherefore be drawn to separate the more from the less guilty. The only\r\nsound one which occurs to me is between those who believed the enterprise\r\nwas with the approbation of the government, open or secret, and those who\r\nmeant to proceed in defiance of the government. Concealment would be no\r\nline at all, because all concealed it. Applying the line of _defiance_\r\nto the case of Lieutenant Meade, it does not appear by any testimony I\r\nhave seen, that he meant to proceed in defiance of the government, but,\r\non the contrary, that he was made to believe the government approved\r\nof the expedition. If it be objected that he concealed a part of what\r\nhad taken place in his communications to the Secretary at War, yet if a\r\nconcealment of the whole would not furnish a proper line of distinction,\r\nstill less would the concealment of a part. This too would be a removal\r\nfor _prevarication_, not for _unauthorized enterprise_, and could not be\r\na proper ground for exercising the extraordinary power of removal by the\r\nPresident. On the whole, I think Lieutenant Meade's is not a case for its\r\nexercise. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ROBERT PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your letter of the 25th, proposing the\r\nappointment of an assistant-engraver to the Mint, at a salary of $600, and\r\nthat Mr. Reich should be the assistant. You are so exclusively competent\r\nto decide on the want of such an officer, that I approve the proposition\r\nin the faith of your opinion. With respect to the person to be appointed,\r\nmy knowledge of the superior talents of Mr. Reich concurs with your\r\nrecommendation in the propriety of appointing him.\r\n\r\nI should approve of your employing the Mint on small silver coins, rather\r\nthan on dollars and gold coins, as far as the consent of those who employ\r\nit can be obtained. It would be much more valuable to the public to be\r\nsupplied with abundance of dimes and half dimes, which would stay among\r\nus, than with dollars and eagles which leave us immediately. Indeed I\r\nwish the law authorized the making two cent and three cent pieces of\r\nsilver, and golden dollars, which would all be large enough to handle, and\r\nwould be a great convenience to our own citizens. Accept my affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LE COMTE DIODATI.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AND ANCIENT FRIEND,--Your letter of August the 29th reached me\r\non the 18th of February. It enclosed a duplicate of that written from\r\nBrunswick five years before, but which I never received, or had notice of,\r\nbut by this duplicate. Be assured, my friend, that I was incapable of such\r\nnegligence towards you, as a failure to answer it would have implied. It\r\nwould illy have accorded with those sentiments of friendship I entertained\r\nfor you at Paris, and which neither time nor distance has lessened. I\r\noften pass in review the many happy hours I spent with Madame Diodati\r\nand yourself on the banks of the Seine, as well as at Paris, and I count\r\nthem among the most pleasing I enjoyed in France. Those were indeed days\r\nof tranquillity and happiness. They had begun to cloud a little before I\r\nleft you; but I had no apprehension that the tempest, of which I saw the\r\nbeginning, was to spread over such an extent of space and time. I have\r\noften thought of you with anxiety, and wished to know how you weathered\r\nthe storm, and into what port you had retired. The letters now received\r\ngive me the first information, and I sincerely felicitate you on your safe\r\nand quiet retreat. Were I in Europe, _pax et panis_ would certainly be my\r\nmotto. Wars and contentions, indeed, fill the pages of history with more\r\nmatter. But more blest is that nation whose silent course of happiness\r\nfurnishes nothing for history to say. This is what I ambition for my own\r\ncountry, and what it has fortunately enjoyed for now upwards of twenty\r\nyears, while Europe has been in constant volcanic eruption, I again, my\r\nfriend, repeat my joy that you have escaped the overwhelming torrent of\r\nits lava.\r\n\r\nAt the end of my present term, of which two years are yet to come, I\r\npropose to retire from public life, and to close my days on my patrimony\r\nof Monticello, in the bosom of my family. I have hitherto enjoyed uniform\r\nhealth; but the weight of public business begins to be too heavy for me,\r\nand I long for the enjoyments of rural life, among my books, my farms and\r\nmy family. Having performed my _quadragena stipendia_, I am entitled to\r\nmy discharge, and should be sorry, indeed, that others should be sooner\r\nsensible than myself when I ought to ask it. I have, therefore, requested\r\nmy fellow citizens to think of a successor for me, to whom I shall deliver\r\nthe public concerns with greater joy than I received them. I have the\r\nconsolation too of having added nothing to my private fortune, during my\r\npublic service, and of retiring with hands as clean as they are empty.\r\nPardon me these egotisms, which, if ever excusable, are so when writing\r\nto a friend to whom our concerns are not uninteresting. I shall always\r\nbe glad to hear of your health and happiness, and having been out of the\r\nway of hearing of any of our cotemporaries of the _corps diplomatique_\r\nat Paris, any details of their subsequent history which you will favor me\r\nwith, will be thankfully received. I pray you to make my friendly respects\r\nacceptable to Madame la Comtesse Diodati, to assure M. Tronchin of my\r\ncontinued esteem, and to accept yourself my affectionate salutations, and\r\nassurances of constant attachment and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, April 2, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 10th of July last; but neither your letter\r\nof October the 20th, nor that of November the 15th mentioning the receipt\r\nof it, I fear it has miscarried. I therefore now enclose a duplicate. As\r\nthat was to go under cover of the Secretary of State's despatches by any\r\nvessel going from our distant ports, I retained the polygraph therein\r\nmentioned for a safer conveyance. None such has occurred till now, that\r\nthe United States armed brig the Wasp, on her way to the Mediterranean is\r\nto touch at Falmouth, with despatches for our ministers at London and at\r\nBrest, with others for yourself and General Armstrong.\r\n\r\nYou heard in due time from London of the signature of a treaty there\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States. By a letter we received\r\nin January from our ministers at London, we found they were making up\r\ntheir minds to sign a treaty, in which no provision was made against the\r\nimpressment of our seamen, contenting themselves with a note received\r\nin the course of their correspondence, from the British negotiators,\r\nassuring them of the discretion with which impressments should be\r\nconducted, which could be construed into a covenant only by inferences,\r\nagainst which its omission in the treaty was a strong inference; and in\r\nits terms totally unsatisfactory. By a letter of February the 3d, they\r\nwere immediately informed that no treaty, not containing a satisfactory\r\narticle on that head, would be ratified, and desiring them to resume the\r\nnegotiations on that point. The treaty having come to us actually in the\r\ninadmissible shape apprehended, we, of course, hold it up until we know\r\nthe result of the instructions of February the 3d. I have but little\r\nexpectation that the British government will retire from their habitual\r\nwrongs in the impressment of our seamen, and am certain, that without\r\nthat, we will never tie up our hands by treaty, from the right of passing\r\na non-importation or non-intercourse act, to make it her interest to\r\nbecome just. This may bring on a war of commercial restrictions. To show,\r\nhowever, the sincerity of our desire for conciliation, I have suspended\r\nthe non-importation act. This state of things should be understood at\r\nParis, and every effort used on your part to accommodate our differences\r\nwith Spain, under the auspices of France, with whom it is all important\r\nthat we should stand in terms of the strictest cordiality. In fact, we\r\nare to depend on her and Russia for the establishment of neutral rights\r\nby the treaty of peace, among which should be that of taking no persons\r\nby a belligerent out of a neutral ship, unless they be the _soldiers_ of\r\nan enemy. Never did a nation act towards another with more perfidy and\r\ninjustice than Spain has constantly practised against us: and if we have\r\nkept our hands off of her till now, it has been purely out of respect to\r\nFrance, and from the value we set on the friendship of France. We expect,\r\ntherefore, from the friendship of the Emperor, that he will either compel\r\nSpain to do us justice, or abandon her to us. We ask but one month to be\r\nin possession of the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\nNo better proof of the good faith of the United States could have been\r\ngiven, than the vigor with which we have acted, and the expense incurred,\r\nin suppressing the enterprise meditated lately by Burr against Mexico.\r\nAlthough at first, he proposed a separation of the western country, and\r\non that ground received encouragement and aid from Yrujo, according to the\r\nusual spirit of his government towards us, yet he very early saw that the\r\nfidelity of the western country was not to be shaken, and turned himself\r\nwholly towards Mexico. And so popular is an enterprise on that country\r\nin this, that we had only to lie still, and he would have had followers\r\nenough to have been in the city of Mexico in six weeks. You have doubtless\r\nseen my several messages to Congress, which give a faithful narrative of\r\nthat conspiracy. Burr himself, after being disarmed by our endeavors of\r\nall his followers, escaped from the custody of the court of Mississippi,\r\nbut was taken near Fort Stoddart, making his way to Mobile, by some\r\ncountry people, who brought him on as a prisoner to Richmond, where he\r\nis now under a course for trial. Hitherto we have believed our law to\r\nbe, that suspicion on probable grounds was sufficient cause to commit a\r\nperson for trial, allowing time to collect witnesses till the trial. But\r\nthe judges here have decided, that conclusive evidence of guilt must be\r\nready in the moment of arrest, or they will discharge the malefactor. If\r\nthis is still insisted on, Burr will be discharged; because his crimes\r\nhaving been sown from Maine, through the whole line of the western waters,\r\nto New Orleans, we cannot bring the witnesses here under four months. The\r\nfact is, that the federalists make Burr's cause their own, and exert their\r\nwhole influence to shield him from punishment, as they did the adherents\r\nof Miranda. And it is unfortunate that federalism is still predominant\r\nin our judiciary department, which is consequently in opposition to the\r\nlegislative and executive branches, and is able to baffle their measures\r\noften.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 6th instant, on the subject of Burr's\r\noffences, was received only four days ago. That there should be anxiety\r\nand doubt in the public mind, in the present defective state of the proof,\r\nis not wonderful; and this has been sedulously encouraged by the tricks of\r\nthe judges to force trials before it is possible to collect the evidence,\r\ndispersed through a line of two thousand miles from Maine to Orleans.\r\nThe federalists, too, give all their aid, making Burr's cause their\r\nown, mortified only that he did not separate the Union or overturn the\r\ngovernment, and proving, that had he had a little dawn of success, they\r\nwould have joined him to introduce his object, their favorite monarchy,\r\nas they would any other enemy, foreign or domestic, who could rid them of\r\nthis hateful republic for any other government in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe first ground of complaint was the supine inattention of the\r\nadministration to a treason stalking through the land in open day. The\r\npresent one, that they have crushed it before it was ripe for execution,\r\nso that no overt acts can be produced. This last may be true; though I\r\nbelieve it is not. Our information having been chiefly by way of letter,\r\nwe do not know of a certainty yet what will be proved. We have set on\r\nfoot an inquiry through the whole of the country which has been the\r\nscene of these transactions, to be able to prove to the courts, if they\r\nwill give time, or to the public by way of communication to Congress,\r\nwhat the real facts have been. For obtaining this, we are obliged to\r\nappeal to the patriotism of particular persons in different places, of\r\nwhom we have requested to make the inquiry in their neighborhood, and on\r\nsuch information as shall be voluntarily offered. Aided by no process\r\nor facilities from the _federal_ courts, but frowned on by their new\r\nborn zeal for the liberty of those whom we would not permit to overthrow\r\nthe liberties of their country, we can expect no revealments from the\r\naccomplices of the chief offender. Of treasonable intentions, the judges\r\nhave been obliged to confess there is probable appearance. What loophole\r\nthey will find in the case, when it comes to trial, we cannot foresee.\r\nEaton, Stoddart, Wilkinson, and two others whom I must not name, will\r\nsatisfy the world, if not the judges, of Burr's guilt. And I do suppose\r\nthe following overt acts will be proved. 1. The enlistment of men, in\r\na regular way. 2. The regular mounting of guard round Blennerhasset's\r\nisland when they expected Governor Tiffin's men to be on them, _modo\r\nguerrino arraiati_. 3. The rendezvous of Burr with his men at the mouth\r\nof Cumberland. 4. His letter to the acting Governor of Mississippi,\r\nholding up the prospect of civil war. 5. His capitulation regularly signed\r\nwith the aids of the Governor, as between two independent and hostile\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\nBut a moment's calculation will show that this evidence cannot be\r\ncollected under four months, probably five, from the moment of deciding\r\nwhen and where the trial shall be. I desired Mr. Rodney expressly to\r\ninform the Chief Justice of this, inofficially. But Mr. Marshall says,\r\n\"More than five weeks have elapsed since the opinion of the Supreme Court\r\nhas declared the necessity of proving the overt acts, if they exist. Why\r\nare they not proved?\" In what terms of decency can we speak of this? As\r\nif an express could go to Natchez, or the mouth of Cumberland, and return\r\nin five weeks, to do which has never taken less than twelve. Again, \"If,\r\nin November or December last, a body of troops had been assembled on\r\nthe Ohio, it is impossible to suppose the affidavits establishing the\r\nfact could not have been obtained by the last of March.\" But I ask the\r\njudge where they should have been lodged? At Frankfort? at Cincinnati? at\r\nNashville? St. Louis? Natchez? New Orleans? These were the probable places\r\nof apprehension and examination. It was not known at _Washington_ till\r\nthe 26th of March that Burr would escape from the Western tribunals, be\r\nretaken and brought to an Eastern one; and in five days after, (neither\r\nfive months nor five weeks, as the judge calculated,) he says, it is\r\n\"impossible to suppose the affidavits could not have been obtained.\"\r\nWhere? At Richmond he certainly meant, or meant only to throw dust in the\r\neyes of his audience. But all the principles of law are to be perverted\r\nwhich would bear on the favorite offenders who endeavor to overturn\r\nthis odious Republic. \"I understand,\" says the judge, \"_probable_ cause\r\nof guilt to be a case made out by _proof_ furnishing good reason to\r\nbelieve,\" &c. Speaking as a lawyer, he must mean legal proof, i. e., proof\r\non oath, at least. But this is confounding _probability_ and _proof_.\r\nWe had always before understood that where there was reasonable ground\r\nto believe guilt, the offender must be put on his trial. That guilty\r\nintentions were probable, the judge believed. And as to the overt acts,\r\nwere not the bundle of letters of information in Mr. Rodney's hands, the\r\nletters and facts published in the local newspapers, Burr's flight, and\r\nthe universal belief or rumor of his guilt, probable ground for presuming\r\nthe facts of enlistment, military guard, rendezvous, threat of civil war,\r\nor capitulation, so as to put him on trial? Is there a candid man in the\r\nUnited States who does not believe some one, if not all, of these overt\r\nacts to have taken place?\r\n\r\nIf there ever had been an instance in this or the preceding\r\nadministrations, of federal judges so applying principles of law as to\r\ncondemn a federal or acquit a republican offender, I should have judged\r\nthem in the present case with more charity. All this, however, will work\r\nwell. The nation will judge both the offender and judges for themselves.\r\nIf a member of the executive or legislature does wrong, the day is never\r\nfar distant when the people will remove him. They will see then and amend\r\nthe error in our Constitution, which makes any branch independent of the\r\nnation. They will see that one of the great co-ordinate branches of the\r\ngovernment, setting itself in opposition to the other two, and to the\r\ncommon sense of the nation, proclaims impunity to that class of offenders\r\nwhich endeavors to overturn the Constitution, and are themselves protected\r\nin it by the Constitution itself; for impeachment is a farce which will\r\nnot be tried again. If their protection of Burr produces this amendment,\r\nit will do more good than his condemnation would have done. Against Burr,\r\npersonally, I never had one hostile sentiment. I never indeed thought\r\nhim an honest, frank-dealing man, but considered him as a crooked gun,\r\nor other perverted machine, whose aim or shot you could never be sure\r\nof. Still, while he possessed the confidence of the nation, I thought\r\nit my duty to respect in him their confidence, and to treat him as if\r\nhe deserved it; and if his punishment can be commuted now for an useful\r\namendment of the Constitution, I shall rejoice in it. My sheet being\r\nfull, I perceive it is high time to offer you my friendly salutations, and\r\nassure you of my constant and affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, April 21st, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 13th came to hand only yesterday, and I now return\r\nyou the letters of Turreau and Woodward, and Mr. Gallatin's paper on\r\nforeign seamen. I retain Monroe and Pinckney's letters, to give them a\r\nmore deliberate perusal than I can now before the departure of the post.\r\nBy the next they shall be returned. I should think it best to answer\r\nTurreau at once, as he will ascribe delay to a supposed difficulty, and\r\nwill be sure to force an answer at last. I take the true principle to be,\r\nthat \"for violations of jurisdiction, with the consent of the sovereign,\r\nor his voluntary sufferance, indemnification is due; but that for others\r\nhe is bound only to use all _reasonable_ means to obtain indemnification\r\nfrom the aggressor, which must be calculated on his circumstances,\r\nand these endeavors _bonâ fide_ made; and failing, he is no further\r\nresponsible.\" It would be extraordinary indeed if we were to be answerable\r\nfor the conduct of belligerents through our whole coast, whether inhabited\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nWill you be so good as to send a passport to Julian Y. Niemcewicz, an\r\nAmerican citizen, of New Jersey, going to Europe on his private affairs?\r\nI have known him intimately for twenty years, the last twelve of which\r\nhe has resided in the United States, of which he has a certificate of\r\ncitizenship. He was the companion of Kosciusko. Be so good as to direct\r\nit to him at Elizabethtown, and without delay, as he is on his departure.\r\nMr. Gallatin's estimate of the number of foreign seamen in our employ\r\nrenders it prudent, I think, to suspend all propositions respecting our\r\nnon-employment of them. As, on a consultation when we were all together,\r\nwe had made up our minds on every article of the British treaty, and this\r\nof not employing their seamen was only mentioned for further inquiry and\r\nconsideration, we had better let the negociations go on, on the ground\r\nthen agreed on, and take time to consider this supplementary proposition.\r\nSuch an addition as this to a treaty already so bad would fill up the\r\nmeasure of public condemnation. It would indeed be making bad worse. I am\r\nmore and more convinced that our best course is, to let the negotiation\r\ntake a friendly nap, and endeavor in the meantime to practice on such\r\nof its principles as are mutually acceptable. Perhaps we may hereafter\r\nbarter the stipulation not to employ their seamen for some equivalent to\r\nour flag, by way of convention; or perhaps the general treaty of peace\r\nmay do better for us, if we shall not, in the meantime, have done worse\r\nfor ourselves. At any rate, it will not be the worse for lying three weeks\r\nlonger. I salute you with sincere affection.\r\n\r\nP. S. Will you be so good as to have me furnished with a copy of Mr.\r\nGallatin's estimate of the number of foreign seamen? I think he overrates\r\nthe number of officers greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nSome very unusual delay has happened to the post, as I received\r\nyesterday only my letter from Philadelphia, as far back as April 9th,\r\nand Washington, April 11th. Of course yours of the 13th and 16th were\r\nthen only received, and being overwhelmed with such an accumulated\r\nmail, I must be short, as the post goes out in a few hours. I return\r\nyou Huston's, Findlay's, and Governor Harrison's letters. J. Smith's is\r\nretained because it is full of nominations. I had received, a week ago,\r\nfrom a member of the Pennsylvania legislature, a copy of their act for the\r\nWestern road. I immediately wrote to Mr. Moore that we should consider\r\nthe question whether the road should pass through Uniontown, as now\r\ndecided affirmatively, and I referred to the commissioner to reconsider\r\nthe question whether it should also pass through Brownsville, and to\r\ndecide it according to their own judgment. I desired him to undertake the\r\nsuperintendence of the execution, to begin the work in time to lay out the\r\nwhole appropriation this summer, and to employ it in making effectually\r\ngood the most difficult parts. I approve of Governor Harrison's lease\r\nto Taylor, and of the conveying the salt water by pipes to the fuel and\r\nnavigation, rather than the fuel and navigation to the Saline. I think\r\nit our indispensable duty to remove immediately all intruders from the\r\nlands, the timber of which will be wanting for the Salines, and will sign\r\nany order you will be so good as to prepare for that purpose. You are\r\nhereby authorized to announce to the collector of Savannah, his removal,\r\nif you judge it for the public good. I recollect nothing of Bullock,\r\nthe attorney, and not having my papers here, I am not able to refresh my\r\nmemory concerning him. I expect to leave this, on my return to Washington,\r\nabout three weeks hence. Your estimate of the number of foreign seamen\r\nin our employ, renders it prudent, in my opinion, to drop the idea of\r\nany proposition not to employ them. As we had made up our minds on every\r\narticle of the British treaty, when consulting together, and this idea\r\nwas only an after thought referred for enquiry and consideration, we had\r\nbetter take more time for it. Time strengthens my belief that no equal\r\ntreaty will be obtained from such a higher as Lord Auckland, or from\r\nthe present ministry, Fox being no longer with them, and that we shall\r\nbe better without any treaty than an unequal one. Perhaps we may engage\r\nthem to act on certain articles, including their note on impressment, by\r\na mutual understanding, under the pretext of further time to arrange a\r\ngeneral treaty. Perhaps, too, the general peace will, in the meantime,\r\nestablish for us better principles than we can obtain ourselves.\r\n\r\nI enclose a letter from Gideon Fitz. Affectionate salutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NIEMCEWICZ.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 22, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received on the 20th your favor of the 10th instant, and\r\nyesterday I wrote to desire the Secretary of State to forward your\r\npassport to Elizabethtown. In the visit you propose to make to your\r\nnative country, I sincerely wish you may find its situation, and your\r\nown interests in it, satisfactory. On what it has been, is, or shall be,\r\nhowever, I shall say nothing. I consider Europe, at present, as a world\r\napart from us, about which it is improper for us even to form opinions, or\r\nto indulge any wishes but the general one, that whatever is to take place\r\nin it, may be for its happiness. For yourself, however, personally, I may\r\nexpress with safety as well as truth, my great esteem and the interest I\r\nfeel for your welfare. From the same principles of caution, I do not write\r\nto my friend Kosciusko. I know he is always doing what he thinks is right,\r\nand he knows my prayers for his success in whatever he does. Assure him,\r\nif you please, of my constant affection, and accept yourself my wishes for\r\na safe and pleasant voyage, with my friendly salutations and assurances of\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 25, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 20th came to hand on the 23d, and I now return all\r\nthe papers it covered, to wit, Harris's, Maunce's, and General Smith's\r\nletters, as also some papers respecting Burr's case, for circulation.\r\nUnder another cover is a letter from Governor Williams, confidential, and\r\nfor yourself alone, as yet. I expect we shall have to remove Meade. Under\r\nstill a different cover you will receive Monroe's and Pinckney's letters,\r\ndetained at the last post. I wrote you then on the subject of the British\r\ntreaty, which the more it is developed the worse it appears. Mr. Rodney\r\nbeing supposed absent, I enclose you a letter from Mr. Reed, advising the\r\nsummoning Rufus Easton as a witness; but if he is at St. Louis, he cannot\r\nbe here by the 22d of May. You will observe that Governor Williams asks\r\nimmediate instructions what he shall do with Blennerhasset, Tyler, Floyd,\r\nand Ralston. I do not know that we can do anything but direct General\r\nWilkinson to receive and send them to any place where the judge shall\r\ndecide they ought to be tried. I suppose Blennerhasset should come to\r\nRichmond. On consulting with the other gentlemen, be so good as to write\r\nto Williams immediately, as a letter will barely get there by the 4th\r\nMonday of May. I enclose you a warrant for five thousand dollars for Mr.\r\nRodney, in the form advised by Mr. Gallatin.\r\n\r\nWe have had three great rains within the last thirteen days. It is just\r\nnow clearing off after thirty-six hours of rain, with little intermission.\r\nYet it is thought not too much. I salute you with sincere affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS MOORE.\r\n\r\n                                                    MONTICELLO, May 1,1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On the 14th of April I wrote to you, on the presumption that a law\r\nrespecting the western road had passed the Legislature of Pennsylvania,\r\nin the form enclosed by Mr. Dorsey, and which I enclosed to you. I have\r\nnow received from the Governor an authentic copy of the law, which agrees\r\nwith that I forwarded to you. You will therefore be pleased to consider\r\nthe contents of that letter as founded in the certainty of the fact that\r\nthe law did pass in that form, although not certainly known at that time,\r\nand proceed on it accordingly. I shall be in Washington on the 16th and\r\n17th inst., should you have occasion for further communication with me. I\r\nsalute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you Monroe's, Armstrong's, Harris's, and Anderson's\r\nletters, and add a letter and act from Gov. McKean, to be filed in your\r\noffice. The proposition for separating the western country, mentioned\r\nby Armstrong to have been made at Paris, is important. But what is the\r\ndeclaration he speaks of? for none accompanies his letter, unless he means\r\nHarry Grant's proposition. I wish our Ministers at Paris, London, and\r\nMadrid, could find out Burr's propositions and agents there. I know few\r\nof the characters of the new British administration. The few I know are\r\ntrue Pittites, and anti-American. From them we have nothing to hope, but\r\nthat they will readily let us back out. Whether they can hold their places\r\nwill depend on the question whether the Irish propositions be popular\r\nor unpopular in England. Dr. Sibley, in a letter to Gen. Dearborne,\r\ncorrects an error of fact in my message to Congress of December. He says\r\nthe Spaniards never had a single soldier at Bayou Pierre till after 1805.\r\nConsequently it was not a keeping, but a taking of a military possession\r\nof that post. I think Gen. Dearborne would do well to desire Sibley to\r\nsend us affidavits of that fact.\r\n\r\nOur weather continues extremely seasonable, and favorable for vegetation.\r\nI salute you with sincere affection.\r\n\r\nP. S. The pamphlet and papers shall be returned by next post.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. OLIVER EVANS.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 2, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 18th came to hand two days ago. That the ingenuity\r\nof an advocate, seeking for something to defend his client, should have\r\nhazarded as an objection that it did not appear on the face of the patent\r\nitself, that you had complied with the requisitions of the act authorizing\r\na patent for your invention, is not wonderful; but I do not expect that\r\nsuch an objection can seriously embarrass the good sense of a judge. The\r\nlaw requires, indeed, that certain acts shall be performed by the inventor\r\nto authorize a monopoly of his invention, and, to secure their being done,\r\nit has called in, and relied on, the agency of the Secretary of State,\r\nthe Attorney General, and President. When they are satisfied the acts\r\nhave been done, they are to execute a patent, granting to the inventor\r\nthe monopoly. But the law does not require that the patent itself should\r\nbear the evidence that they should have been performed, any more than it\r\nrequires that in a judgment should be stated all the evidence on which it\r\nis founded. The evidence of the acts on which the patent is founded, rests\r\nwith those whose duty it is to see that they are performed; in fact, it is\r\nin the Secretary of State's office, where the interloper or inventor may\r\nhave recourse to it if wanting. If these high officers have really failed\r\nto see that the acts were performed, or to preserve evidence of it, they\r\nhave broken their trust to the public, and are responsible to the public;\r\nbut their negligence cannot invalidate the inventor's right, who has been\r\nguilty of no fault. On the contrary, the patent, which is a record, has\r\nconveyed a right to him from the public, and that it was issued rightfully\r\nought to be believed on the signature of these high officers affixed\r\nto the patent,--this being a solemn pledge on their part that the acts\r\nhad been performed. Would their assertion of the fact, in the patent\r\nitself, pledge them more to the public? I do not think, then, that the\r\ndisinterested judgment of a court can find difficulty in this objection.\r\nAt any rate your right will be presumed valid, until they decide that\r\nit is not. Their final decision alone can authorize your resort to any\r\nremedial authority,--that is to say, to the Legislature, who alone can\r\nprovide a remedy. Certainly an inventor ought to be allowed a right to\r\nthe benefit of his invention for some certain time. It is equally certain\r\nit ought not to be perpetual; for to embarrass society with monopolies\r\nfor every utensil existing, and in all the details of life, would be more\r\ninjurious to them than had the supposed inventors never existed; because\r\nthe natural understanding of its members would have suggested the same\r\nthings or others as good. How long the term should be is the difficult\r\nquestion. Our Legislators have copied the English estimate of the term,\r\nperhaps without sufficiently considering how much longer, in a country so\r\nmuch more sparsely settled, it takes for an invention to become known,\r\nand used to an extent profitable to the inventor. Nobody wishes more\r\nthan I do that ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement: nobody\r\nestimates higher the utility which society has derived from that displayed\r\nby yourself; and I assure you with truth, that I shall always be ready\r\nto manifest it by every service I can render you. To this assurance I add\r\nthat of my great respect and esteem, and my friendly salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 5, 1807.\r\n\r\nI return you the pamphlet of the author of War in Disguise. Of its first\r\nhalf, the topics and the treatment of them are very commonplace; but from\r\npage 118 to 130 it is most interesting to all nations, and especially\r\nto us. Convinced that a militia of all ages promiscuously are entirely\r\nuseless for distant service, and that we never shall be safe until we have\r\na selected corps for a year's distant service at least, the classification\r\nof our militia is now the most essential thing the United States have to\r\ndo. Whether, on Bonaparte's plan of making a class for every year between\r\ncertain periods, or that recommended in my message, I do not know, but\r\nI rather incline to his. The idea is not new, as, you may remember, we\r\nadopted it once in Virginia during the revolution, but abandoned it too\r\nsoon. It is the real secret of Bonaparte's success. Could H. Smith put\r\nbetter matter into his paper than the twelve pages above mentioned, and\r\nwill you suggest it to him? No effort should be spared to bring the public\r\nmind to this great point. I salute you with sincere affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JOHN SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your two letters of March 27th and April 6th have been\r\nreceived. Writing from this place, where I have not my papers to turn\r\nto, I cannot even say whether I have received such as you ask copies of.\r\nBut I am sorry to answer any request of yours by saying that a compliance\r\nwould be a breach of trust. It is essential for the public interest that\r\nI should receive all the information possible respecting either matters\r\nor persons connected with the public. To induce people to give this\r\ninformation, they must feel assured that when deposited with me it is\r\nsecret and sacred. Honest men might justifiably withhold information,\r\nif they expected the communication would be made public, and commit them\r\nto war with their neighbors and friends. This imposes the duty on me of\r\nconsidering such information as mere suggestions for inquiry, and to put\r\nme on my guard; and to injure no man by forming any opinion until the\r\nsuggestion be verified. Long experience in this school has by no means\r\nstrengthened the disposition to believe too easily. On the contrary, it\r\nhas begotten an incredulity which leaves no one's character in danger\r\nfrom any hasty conclusion. I hope these considerations will satisfy you,\r\nboth as they respect you and myself, and that you will be assured I shall\r\nalways be better pleased with those cases which admit that compliance with\r\nyour wishes which is always pleasing to me. Accept my salutations, and\r\nassurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nI return you Monroe's letter of March 5th. As the explosion in the\r\nBritish ministry took place about the 15th, I hope we shall be spared\r\nthe additional embarrassment of his convention. I enclose you a letter\r\nof Michael Jones for circulation, and to rest with the Attorney General.\r\nIt contains new instances of Burr's enlistments. I received this from Mr.\r\nGallatin, so you can hand it to General Dearborne direct.\r\n\r\nI expect to leave this on the 13th, but there is a possible occurrence\r\nwhich may prevent it till the 19th, which however is not probable. Accept\r\naffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Dr. Bollman, on his arrival here in custody in January,\r\nvoluntarily offered to make communications to me, which he accordingly\r\ndid, Mr. Madison also being present. I previously and subsequently assured\r\nhim, (without, however, his having requested it,) that they should never\r\nbe used _against himself_. Mr. Madison on the same evening committed to\r\nwriting, by memory, what he had said; and I moreover asked of Bollman\r\nto do it himself, which he did, and I now enclose it to you. The object\r\nis, as he is to be a witness, that you may know how to examine him, and\r\ndraw everything from him. I wish the paper to be seen and known only to\r\nyourself and the gentlemen who aid you, and to be returned to me. If\r\nhe should prevaricate, I should be willing you should go so far as to\r\nask him whether he did not say so and so to Mr. Madison and myself. In\r\norder to let him see that his prevarications will be marked, Mr. Madison\r\nwill forward you a pardon for him, which we mean should be delivered\r\npreviously. It is suspected by some he does not intend to appear. If he\r\ndoes not, I hope you will take effectual measures to have him immediately\r\ntaken into custody. Some other blank pardons are sent on to be filled\r\nup at your discretion, if you should find a defect of evidence, and\r\nbelieve that this would supply it, by avoiding to give them to the gross\r\noffenders, unless it be visible that the principal will otherwise escape.\r\nI send you an affidavit of importance received last night. If General\r\nWilkinson gets on in time, I expect he will bring Dunbaugh on with him.\r\nAt any rate it may be a ground for an arrest and commitment for treason.\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DE LA COSTE.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 24, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received, in due time, your favor of April 10th, enclosing a\r\nscheme and subscription for the establishment of a museum of natural\r\nhistory, at Williamsburgh, by private contributions. Nobody can desire\r\nmore ardently than myself, to concur in whatever may promote useful\r\nscience, and I view no science with more partiality than natural history.\r\nBut I have ever believed that in this, as in most other cases, abortive\r\nattempts retard rather than promote this object. To be really useful\r\nwe must keep pace with the state of society, and not dishearten it by\r\nattempts at what its population, means, or occupations will fail in\r\nattempting. In the particular enterprises for museums, we have seen\r\nthe populous and wealthy cities of Boston and New York unable to found\r\nor maintain such an institution. The feeble condition of that in each\r\nof these places sufficiently proves this. In Philadelphia alone, has\r\nthis attempt succeeded to a good degree? It has been owing there to\r\na measure of zeal and perseverance in an individual rarely equalled;\r\nto a population, crowded, wealthy, and more than usually addicted to\r\nthe pursuit of knowledge. And, with all this, the institution does not\r\nmaintain itself. The proprietor has been obliged to return to the practice\r\nof his original profession to help it on. I know, indeed, that there\r\nare many individuals in Williamsburg, and its vicinity, who have already\r\nattained a high degree of science, and many zealously pursuing it. But\r\nafter viewing all circumstances there as favorably as the most sanguine\r\nof us could wish, I cannot find in them a rational ground for expecting\r\nsuccess in an undertaking to which the other positions have been found\r\nunequal. I sincerely wish I may be mistaken, and that the success which\r\nyour zeal I am sure will merit, may be equal to your wishes, as well\r\nas ours. But, for the present, I would rather reserve myself till its\r\nprospects can be more favorably estimated; because the aid we would be\r\ndisposed to give to a promising enterprise, would be very different to\r\none we might offer to a desperate one. Although less sanguine on this\r\nparticular subject, I do entire justice to the zeal for the promotion of\r\nscience, which has excited your effort, and shall see it with uncommon\r\npleasure surmounting the present difficulties, or engaged in other\r\npursuits which may reward it with better success. Be assured that no one\r\nis more sincere in wishing it, and accept my salutations and assurances of\r\ngreat respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CLINTON.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 24, 1807.\r\n\r\nTh: Jefferson presents his compliments to Mr. Clinton, and his thanks for\r\nthe pamphlet sent him. He recollects the having read it at the time with\r\na due sense of his obligation to the author, whose name was surmised,\r\nthough not absolutely known, and a conviction that he had made the most\r\nof his matter. The ground of defence might have been solidly aided by\r\nthe assurance (which is the absolute fact) that the whole story fathered\r\non Mazzei, was an unfounded falsehood. Dr. Linn, as aware of that, takes\r\ncare to quote it from a dead man, who is made to quote from one residing\r\nin the remotest part of Europe. Equally false was Dr. Linn's other story\r\nabout Bishop Madison's lawn sleeves, as the Bishop can testify, for\r\ncertainly Th: J. never saw him in lawn sleeves. Had the Doctor ventured to\r\nname time, place, and person, for his third lie, (the government without\r\nreligion) it is probable he might have been convicted on that also. But\r\nthese are slander and slanderers, whom Th: Jefferson has thought it best\r\nto leave to the scourge of public opinion. He salutes Mr. Clinton with\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 26, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--We are this moment informed by a person who left Richmond since\r\nthe 22d, that the prosecution of Burr had begun under very inauspicious\r\nsymptoms by the challenging and rejecting two members of the Grand Jury,\r\nas far above all exception as any two persons in the United States. I\r\nsuppose our informant is inaccurate in his terms, and has mistaken an\r\nobjection by the criminal and voluntary retirement of the gentlemen with\r\nthe permission of the court, for a challenge and rejection, which, in the\r\ncase of a Grand Jury, is impossible. Be this as it may, and the result\r\nbefore the formal tribunal, fair or false, it becomes our duty to provide\r\nthat full testimony shall be laid before the Legislature, and through\r\nthem the public. For this purpose, it is necessary that we be furnished\r\nwith the testimony of every person who shall be with you as a witness.\r\nIf the Grand Jury find a bill, the evidence given in court, taken as\r\nverbatim as possible, will be what we desire. If there be no bill, and\r\nconsequently no examination before court, then I must beseech you to\r\nhave every man privately examined by way of affidavit, and to furnish me\r\nwith the whole testimony. In the former case, the person taking down the\r\ntestimony as orally delivered in court, should make oath that he believes\r\nit to be substantially correct. In the latter case, the certificate of the\r\nmagistrate administering the oath, and signature of the party, will be\r\nproper; and this should be done before they receive their compensation,\r\nthat they may not evade examination. Go into any expense necessary for\r\nthis purpose, and meet it from the funds provided by the Attorney General\r\nfor the other expenses. He is not here, or this request would have gone\r\nfrom him directly. I salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have this moment received your letter of the 25th, and hasten\r\nto answer it. If the grand jury do not find a bill against Burr, as there\r\nwill be no examination before a petty jury, Bollman's pardon need not in\r\nthat case to be delivered; but if a bill be found, and a trial had, his\r\nevidence is deemed entirely essential, and in that case his pardon is to\r\nbe produced before he goes to the book. In my letter of the day before\r\nyesterday, I enclosed you Bollman's written communication to me, and\r\nobserved you might go so far, if he prevaricated, as to ask him whether\r\nhe did not say so and so to Mr. Madison and myself. On further reflection\r\nI think you may go farther, if he prevaricates grossly, and show the\r\npaper to him, and ask if it is not his handwriting, and confront him by\r\nits contents. I enclose you some other letters of Bollman to me on former\r\noccasions, to prove by similitude of hand that the paper I enclosed on the\r\n26th was of his handwriting. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have not written to you by Mr. Purviance, because he can give\r\nyou _vivâ voce_ all the details of our affairs here, with a minuteness\r\nbeyond the bounds of a letter, and because, indeed, I am not certain this\r\nletter will find you in England. The sole object in writing it, is to add\r\nanother little commission to the one I had formerly troubled you with. It\r\nis to procure for me \"a machine for ascertaining the resistance of ploughs\r\nor carriages, invented and sold by Winlaw, in Margaret street, Cavendish\r\nSquare.\" It will cost, I believe, four or five guineas, which shall be\r\nreplaced here instanter on your arrival. I had intended to have written\r\nyou to counteract the wicked efforts which the federal papers are making\r\nto sow tares between you and me, as if I were lending a hand to measures\r\nunfriendly to any views which our country might entertain respecting you.\r\nBut I have not done it, because I have before assured you that a sense\r\nof duty, as well as of delicacy, would prevent me from ever expressing a\r\nsentiment on the subject, and that I think you know me well enough to be\r\nassured I shall conscientiously observe the line of conduct I profess.\r\nI shall receive you on your return with the warm affection I have ever\r\nentertained for you, and be gratified if I can in any way avail the public\r\nof your services. God bless you and yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. SILVESTRE, SECRETAIRE DE LA SOCIETE D'AGRICULTURE DE PARIS.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received, through the care of Gen. Armstrong, the medal of\r\ngold by which the society of agriculture at Paris have been pleased to\r\nmark their approbation of the form of a mould-board which I had proposed;\r\nalso the four first volumes of their memoirs, and the information that\r\nthey had honored me with the title of foreign associate to their society.\r\nI receive with great thankfulness these testimonies of their favor, and\r\nshould be happy to merit them by greater services. Attached to agriculture\r\nby inclination, as well as by a conviction that it is the most useful of\r\nthe occupations of man, my course of life has not permitted me to add\r\nto its theories the lessons of practice. I fear, therefore, I shall be\r\nto them but an unprofitable member, and shall have little to offer of\r\nmyself worthy their acceptance. Should the labors of others, however,\r\non this side the water, produce anything which may advance the objects\r\nof their institution, I shall with great pleasure become the instrument\r\nof its communication, and shall moreover execute with zeal any orders of\r\nthe society in this portion of the globe. I pray you to express to them\r\nmy sensibility for the distinctions they have been pleased to confer on\r\nme, and to accept yourself the assurances of my high consideration and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, June 2, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--While Burr's case is depending before the court, I will\r\ntrouble you, from time to time, with what occurs to me. I observe that\r\nthe case of Marbury v. Madison has been cited, and I think it material\r\nto stop at the threshold the citing that case as authority, and to have\r\nit denied to be law. 1. Because the judges, in the outset, disclaimed\r\nall cognizance of the case, although they then went on to say what would\r\nhave been their opinion, had they had cognizance of it. This, then, was\r\nconfessedly an extrajudicial opinion, and, as such, of no authority. 2.\r\nBecause, had it been judicially pronounced, it would have been against\r\nlaw; for to a commission, a deed, a bond, _delivery_ is essential to\r\ngive validity. Until, therefore, the commission is delivered out of\r\nthe hands of the executive and his agents, it is not his deed. He may\r\nwithhold or cancel it at pleasure, as he might his private deed in the\r\nsame situation. The Constitution intended that the three great branches\r\nof the government should be co-ordinate, and independent of each other.\r\nAs to acts, therefore, which are to be done by either, it has given no\r\ncontrol to another branch. A judge, I presume, cannot sit on a bench\r\nwithout a commission, or a record of a commission; and the Constitution\r\nhaving given to the judiciary branch no means of compelling the executive\r\neither to _deliver_ a commission, or to make a record of it, shows it\r\ndid not intend to give the judiciary that control over the executive,\r\nbut that it should remain in the power of the latter to do it or not.\r\nWhere different branches have to act in their respective lines, finally\r\nand without appeal, under any law, they may give to it different and\r\nopposite constructions. Thus, in the case of William Smith, the House of\r\nRepresentatives determined he was a citizen; and in the case of William\r\nDuane, (precisely the same in every material circumstance,) the judges\r\ndetermined he was no citizen. In the cases of Callendar and others, the\r\njudges determined the sedition act was valid under the Constitution,\r\nand exercised their regular powers of sentencing them to fine and\r\nimprisonment. But the executive determined that the sedition act was\r\na nullity under the Constitution, and exercised his regular power of\r\nprohibiting the execution of the sentence, or rather of executing the real\r\nlaw, which protected the acts of the defendants. From these different\r\nconstructions of the same act by different branches, less mischief\r\narises than from giving to any one of them a control over the others. The\r\nexecutive and Senate act on the construction, that until delivery from\r\nthe executive department, a commission is in their possession, and within\r\ntheir rightful power; and in cases of commissions not revocable at will,\r\nwhere, after the Senate's approbation and the President's signing and\r\nsealing, new information of the unfitness of the person has come to hand\r\nbefore the _delivery_ of the commission, new nominations have been made\r\nand approved, and new commissions have issued.\r\n\r\nOn this construction I have hitherto acted; on this I shall ever act,\r\nand maintain it with the powers of the government, against any control\r\nwhich may be attempted by the judges, in subversion of the independence\r\nof the executive and Senate within their peculiar department. I presume,\r\ntherefore, that in a case where our decision is by the Constitution\r\nthe supreme one, and that which can be carried into effect, it is the\r\nconstitutionally authoritative one, and that that by the judges was\r\n_coram non judice_, and unauthoritative, because it cannot be carried\r\ninto effect. I have long wished for a proper occasion to have the\r\ngratuitous opinion in Marbury _v._ Madison brought before the public, and\r\ndenounced as not law; and I think the present a fortunate one, because\r\nit occupies such a place in the public attention. I should be glad,\r\ntherefore, if, in noticing that case, you could take occasion to express\r\nthe determination of the executive, that the doctrines of that case were\r\ngiven extrajudicially and against law, and that their reverse will be the\r\nrule of action with the executive. If this opinion should not be your\r\nown, I would wish it to be expressed merely as that of the executive.\r\nIf it is your own also, you would of course give to the arguments such a\r\ndevelopment as a case, incidental only, might render proper. I salute you\r\nwith friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                              June 3, 1807.\r\n\r\nI gave you, some time ago, a project of a more equal tariff on wines than\r\nthat which now exists. But in that I yielded considerably to the faulty\r\nclassification of them in our law. I have now formed one with attention,\r\nand according to the best information I possess, classing them more\r\nrigorously. I am persuaded that were the duty on cheap wines put on the\r\nsame ratio with the dear, it would wonderfully enlarge the field of those\r\nwho use wine, to the expulsion of whiskey. The introduction of a very\r\ncheap wine (St. George) into my neighborhood, within two years past, has\r\nquadrupled in that time the number of those who keep wine, and will ere\r\nlong increase them tenfold. This would be a great gain to the treasury,\r\nand to the sobriety of our country. I will here add my tariff, (_see\r\nopposite page_,) wherein you will be able to choose any rate of duty you\r\nplease, and to decide whether it will not, on a fit occasion, be proper\r\nfor legislative attention. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------+-------+---------+--------+-------------\r\n                                            | Cost  |         |        |25 per

Most of them took his word\r\nfor it, but it is said that with those who would not, the following\r\nstratagem was practised. A forged letter, purporting to be from General\r\nDearborne, was made to express his approbation, and to say that I was\r\nabsent at Monticello, but that there was no doubt that, on my return, my\r\napprobation of his enterprises would be given. This letter was spread open\r\non his table, so as to invite the eye of whoever entered his room, and he\r\ncontrived occasions of sending up into his room those whom he wished to\r\nbecome witnesses of his acting under sanction. By this means he avoided\r\ncommitting himself to any liability to prosecution for forgery, and gave\r\nanother proof of being a great man in little things, while he is really\r\nsmall in great ones. I must add General Dearborne's declaration, that he\r\nnever wrote a letter to Burr in his life, except that when here, once in\r\na winter, he usually wrote him a billet of invitation to dine. The only\r\nobject of sending you the enclosed letters is to possess you of the fact,\r\nthat you may know how to pursue it, if any of your witnesses should know\r\nanything of it. My intention in writing to you several times, has been\r\nto convey facts or observations occurring in the absence of the Attorney\r\nGeneral, and not to make to the dreadful drudgery you are going through\r\nthe unnecessary addition of writing me letters in answer, which I beg\r\nyou to relieve yourself from, except when some necessity calls for it. I\r\nsalute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WEAVER.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, June 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of March 30th never reached my hands till May 16th.\r\nThe friendly views it expresses of my conduct in general give me great\r\nsatisfaction. For these testimonies of the approbation of my fellow\r\ncitizens, I know that I am indebted more to their indulgent dispositions\r\nthan to any peculiar claims of my own. For it can give no great claims\r\nto any one to manage honestly and disinterestedly the concerns of others\r\ntrusted to him. Abundant examples of this are always under our eye. That I\r\nshould lay down my charge at a proper season, is as much a duty as to have\r\nborne it faithfully. Being very sensible of bodily decays from advancing\r\nyears, I ought not to doubt their effect on the mental faculties. To do so\r\nwould evince either great self-love or little observation of what passes\r\nunder our eyes; and I shall be fortunate if I am the first to perceive and\r\nto obey this admonition of nature. That there are in our country a great\r\nnumber of characters entirely equal to the management of its affairs,\r\ncannot be doubted. Many of them, indeed, have not had opportunities of\r\nmaking themselves known to their fellow citizens; but many have had,\r\nand the only difficulty will be to choose among them. These changes\r\nare necessary, too, for the security of republican government. If some\r\nperiod be not fixed, either by the Constitution or by practice, to the\r\nservices of the First Magistrate, his office, though nominally elective,\r\nwill, in fact, be for life; and that will soon degenerate into an\r\ninheritance. Among the felicities which have attended my administration,\r\nI am most thankful for having been able to procure coadjutors so able,\r\nso disinterested, and so harmonious. Scarcely ever has a difference of\r\nopinion appeared among us which has not, by candid consultation, been\r\namalgamated into something which all approved; and never one which in\r\nthe slightest degree affected our personal attachments. The proof we\r\nhave lately seen of the innate strength of our government, is one of\r\nthe most remarkable which history has recorded, and shows that we are a\r\npeople capable of self-government, and worthy of it. The moment that a\r\nproclamation apprised our citizens that there were traitors among them,\r\nand what was their object, they rose upon them wherever they lurked, and\r\ncrushed by their own strength what would have produced the march of armies\r\nand civil war in any other country. The government which can wield the arm\r\nof the people must be the strongest possible. I thank you for the interest\r\nyou are so kind as to express in my health and welfare, and return you the\r\nsame good wishes with my salutations, and assurance of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR HORATIO TURPIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of June the 1st has been received. To a mind like\r\nyours, capable in any question of abstracting it from its relation to\r\nyourself, I may safely hazard explanations, which I have generally avoided\r\nto others on questions of appointment. Bringing into office no desires of\r\nmaking it subservient to the advancement of my own private interests, it\r\nhas been no sacrifice, by postponing them, to strengthen the confidence\r\nof my fellow citizens. But I have not felt equal indifference towards\r\nexcluding merit from office, merely because it was related to me. However,\r\nI have thought it my duty so to do, that my constituents may be satisfied,\r\nthat, in selecting persons for the management of their affairs, I am\r\ninfluenced by neither personal nor family interests, and especially, that\r\nthe field of public office will not be perverted by me into a family\r\nproperty. On this subject, I had the benefit of useful lessons from my\r\npredecessors, had I needed them, marking what was to be imitated and what\r\navoided. But in truth, the nature of our government is lesson enough.\r\nIts energy depending mainly on the confidence of the people in the chief\r\nmagistrate, makes it his duty to spare nothing which can strengthen him\r\nwith that confidence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN NORVELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of May the 9th has been duly received. The subject it\r\nproposes would require time and space for even moderate development. My\r\noccupations limit me to a very short notice of them. I think there does\r\nnot exist a good elementary work on the organization of society into civil\r\ngovernment: I mean a work which presents in one full and comprehensive\r\nview the system of principles on which such an organization should be\r\nfounded, according to the rights of nature. For want of a single work\r\nof that character, I should recommend Locke on Government, Sidney,\r\nPriestley's Essay on the first Principles of Government, Chipman's\r\nPrinciples of Government, and the Federalist. Adding, perhaps, Beccaria\r\non crimes and punishments, because of the demonstrative manner in which\r\nhe has treated that branch of the subject. If your views of political\r\ninquiry go further, to the subjects of money and commerce, Smith's Wealth\r\nof Nations is the best book to be read, unless Say's Political Economy\r\ncan be had, which treats the same subjects on the same principles, but in\r\na shorter compass and more lucid manner. But I believe this work has not\r\nbeen translated into our language.\r\n\r\nHistory, in general, only informs us what bad government is. But as we\r\nhave employed some of the best materials of the British constitution in\r\nthe construction of our own government, a knowledge of British history\r\nbecomes useful to the American politician. There is, however, no general\r\nhistory of that country which can be recommended. The elegant one of\r\nHume seems intended to disguise and discredit the good principles of the\r\ngovernment, and is so plausible and pleasing in its style and manner, as\r\nto instil its errors and heresies insensibly into the minds of unwary\r\nreaders. Baxter has performed a good operation on it. He has taken the\r\ntext of Hume as his ground work, abridging it by the omission of some\r\ndetails of little interest, and wherever he has found him endeavoring to\r\nmislead, by either the suppression of a truth or by giving it a false\r\ncoloring, he has changed the text to what it should be, so that we may\r\nproperly call it Hume's history republicanised. He has moreover continued\r\nthe history (but indifferently) from where Hume left it, to the year\r\n1800. The work is not popular in England, because it is republican; and\r\nbut a few copies have ever reached America. It is a single quarto volume.\r\nAdding to this Ludlow's Memoirs, Mrs. M'Cauley's and Belknap's histories,\r\na sufficient view will be presented of the free principles of the English\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nTo your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should\r\nbe conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, \"by restraining\r\nit to true facts and sound principles only.\" Yet I fear such a paper would\r\nfind few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the\r\npress could not more completely deprive the nation of its benefits, than\r\nis done by its abandoned prostitution to falsehood. Nothing can now be\r\nbelieved which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by\r\nbeing put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of\r\nmisinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront\r\nfacts within their knowledge with the lies of the day. I really look with\r\ncommiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading\r\nnewspapers, live and die in the belief, that they have known something of\r\nwhat has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts\r\nthey have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other\r\nperiod of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the\r\nday are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected\r\nfrom them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a\r\nsuccessful warrior, that he has subjected a great portion of Europe to\r\nhis will, &c., &c.; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the\r\nman who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads\r\nthem; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose\r\nmind is filled with falsehoods and errors. He who reads nothing will still\r\nlearn the great facts, and the details are all false.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this.\r\nDivide his paper into four chapters, heading the 1st, Truths. 2d,\r\nProbabilities. 3d, Possibilities. 4th, Lies. The first chapter would be\r\nvery short, as it would contain little more than authentic papers, and\r\ninformation from such sources, as the editor would be willing to risk\r\nhis own reputation for their truth. The second would contain what, from\r\na mature consideration of all circumstances, his judgment should conclude\r\nto be probably true. This, however, should rather contain too little than\r\ntoo much. The third and fourth should be professedly for those readers\r\nwho would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they would\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\nSuch an editor too, would have to set his face against the demoralizing\r\npractice of feeding the public mind habitually on slander, and the\r\ndepravity of taste which this nauseous aliment induces. Defamation is\r\nbecoming a necessary of life; insomuch, that a dish of tea in the morning\r\nor evening cannot be digested without this stimulant. Even those who do\r\nnot believe these abominations, still read them with complaisance to their\r\nauditors, and instead of the abhorrence and indignation which should fill\r\na virtuous mind, betray a secret pleasure in the possibility that some may\r\nbelieve them, though they do not themselves. It seems to escape them, that\r\nit is not he who prints, but he who pays for printing a slander, who is\r\nits real author.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts on the subjects of your letter are hazarded at your\r\nrequest. Repeated instances of the publication of what has not been\r\nintended for the public eye, and the malignity with which political\r\nenemies torture every sentence from me into meanings imagined by their\r\nown wickedness only, justify my expressing a solicitude, that this hasty\r\ncommunication may in nowise be permitted to find its way into the public\r\npapers. Not fearing these political bull-dogs, I yet avoid putting myself\r\nin the way of being baited by them, and do not wish to volunteer away that\r\nportion of tranquillity, which a firm execution of my duties will permit\r\nme to enjoy.\r\n\r\nI tender you my salutations, and best wishes, for your success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR, * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe proposition in your letter of May the 16th, of adding an umpire to\r\nour discordant negotiators at Paris, struck me favorably on reading it,\r\nand reflection afterwards strengthened my first impressions. I made it\r\ntherefore a subject of consultation with my coadjutors, as is our usage.\r\nFor our government, although in theory subject to be directed by the\r\nunadvised will of the President, is, and from its origin has been, a very\r\ndifferent thing in practice. The minor business in each department is done\r\nby the Head of the department, on consultation with the President alone.\r\nBut all matters of importance or difficulty are submitted to all the\r\nHeads of departments composing the cabinet; sometimes by the President's\r\nconsulting them separately and successively, as they happen to call on\r\nhim; but in the greatest cases, by calling them together, discussing the\r\nsubject maturely, and finally taking the vote, in which the President\r\ncounts himself but as one. So that in all important cases the executive\r\nis, in fact, a directory, which certainly the President might control; but\r\nof this there was never an example, either in the first or the present\r\nadministration. I have heard, indeed, that my predecessor sometimes\r\ndecided things against his council. * * * * * I adopted in the present\r\ncase the mode of separate consultation. The opinion of each member, taken\r\nseparately, was that the addition of a third negotiator was not at this\r\ntime advisable. For the present therefore, the question must rest. Mr.\r\nBowdoin, we know, is anxious to come home, and is detained only by the\r\ndelicacy of not deserting his post. In the existing temper between him and\r\nhis colleague, it would certainly be better that one of them should make\r\nan opening for re-composing the commission more harmoniously.\r\n\r\nI salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 9th is this moment received. Reserving\r\nthe necessary right of the President of the United States to decide,\r\nindependently of all other authority, what papers, coming to him as\r\nPresident, the public interests permit to be communicated, and to whom, I\r\nassure you of my readiness under that restriction, voluntarily to furnish\r\non all occasions, whatever the purposes of justice may require. But\r\nthe letter of General Wilkinson, of October the 21st, requested for the\r\ndefence of Colonel Burr, with every other paper relating to the charges\r\nagainst him, which were in my possession when the Attorney General went\r\non to Richmond in March, I then delivered to him; and I have always taken\r\nfor granted he left the whole with you. If he did, and the bundle retains\r\nthe order in which I had arranged it, you will readily find the letter\r\ndesired, under the date of its receipt, which was November the 25th; but\r\nlest the Attorney General should not have left those papers with you, I\r\nthis day write to him to forward this one by post. An uncertainty whether\r\nhe is at Philadelphia, Wilmington, or New Castle, may produce delay in his\r\nreceiving my letter, of which it is proper you should be apprized. But, as\r\nI do not recollect the whole contents of that letter, I must beg leave to\r\ndevolve on you the exercise of that discretion which it would be my right\r\nand duty to exercise, by withholding the communication of any parts of the\r\nletter, which are not directly material for the purposes of justice.\r\n\r\nWith this application, which is specific, a prompt compliance is\r\npracticable. But when the request goes to \"copies of the orders issued\r\nin relation to Colonel Burr, to the officers at Orleans, Natchez, &c.\r\nby the Secretaries of the War and Navy departments,\" it seems to cover\r\na correspondence of many months, with such a variety of officers, civil\r\nand military, all over the United States, as would amount to the laying\r\nopen the whole executive books. I have desired the Secretary at War to\r\nexamine his official communications; and on a view of these, we may be\r\nable to judge what can and ought to be done, towards a compliance with\r\nthe request. If the defendant alleges that there was any particular order,\r\nwhich, as a cause, produced any particular act on his part, then he must\r\nknow what this order was, can specify it, and a prompt answer can be\r\ngiven. If the _object_ had been specified, we might then have some guide\r\nfor our conjectures, as to what part of the executive records might be\r\nuseful to him; but, with a perfect willingness to do what is right, we are\r\nwithout the indications which may enable us to do it. If the researches of\r\nthe Secretary at War should produce anything proper for communication, and\r\npertinent to any point we can conceive in the defence before the court, it\r\nshall be forwarded to you.\r\n\r\nI salute you with respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In answering your letter of the 9th, which desired a communication\r\nof one to me from General Wilkinson, specified by its date, I informed\r\nyou in mine of the 12th that I had delivered it, with all other papers\r\nrespecting the charges against Aaron Burr, to the Attorney General,\r\nwhen he went to Richmond; that I had supposed he had left them in your\r\npossession, but would immediately write to him, if he had not, to forward\r\nthat particular letter without delay. I wrote to him accordingly on the\r\nsame day, but having no answer, I know not whether he has forwarded the\r\nletter. I stated in the same letter, that I had desired the Secretary at\r\nWar to examine his office, in order to comply with your further request,\r\nto furnish copies of the orders which had been given respecting Aaron\r\nBurr and his property; and in a subsequent letter of the same day, I\r\nforwarded to you copies of two letters from the Secretary at War, which\r\nappeared to be within the description expressed in your letter. The\r\norder from the Secretary of the Navy, you said, you were in possession\r\nof. The receipt of these papers had, I presume, so far anticipated, and\r\nothers this day forwarded will have substantially fulfilled the object\r\nof a subpœna from the District Court of Richmond, requiring that those\r\nofficers and myself should attend the Court in Richmond, with the letter\r\nof General Wilkinson, the answer to that letter, and the orders of the\r\ndepartments of War and the Navy, therein generally described. No answer\r\nto General Wilkinson's letter, other than a mere acknowledgment of its\r\nreceipt, in a letter written for a different purpose, was ever written by\r\nmyself or any other. To these communications of papers, I will add, that\r\nif the defendant supposes there are any facts within the knowledge of the\r\nHeads of departments, or of myself, which can be useful for his defence,\r\nfrom a desire of doing anything our situation will permit in furtherance\r\nof justice, we shall be ready to give him the benefit of it, by way of\r\ndeposition, through any persons whom the Court shall authorize to take our\r\ntestimony at this place. I know, indeed, that this cannot be done but by\r\nconsent of parties; and I therefore authorize you to give consent on the\r\npart of the United States. Mr. Burr's consent will be given of course, if\r\nhe supposes the testimony useful.\r\n\r\nAs to our personal attendance at Richmond, I am persuaded the Court\r\nis sensible, that paramount duties to the nation at large control the\r\nobligation of compliance with their summons in this case; as they would,\r\nshould we receive a similar one, to attend the trials of Blannerhassett\r\nand others, in the Mississippi territory, those instituted at St. Louis\r\nand other places on the western waters, or at any place, other than the\r\nseat of government. To comply with such calls would leave the nation\r\nwithout an executive branch, whose agency, nevertheless, is understood\r\nto be so constantly necessary, that it is the sole branch which the\r\nconstitution requires to be always in function. It could not then mean\r\nthat it should be withdrawn from its station by any co-ordinate authority.\r\n\r\nWith respect to papers, there is certainly a public and a private side to\r\nour offices. To the former belong grants of land, patents for inventions,\r\ncertain commissions, proclamations, and other papers patent in their\r\nnature. To the other belong mere executive proceedings. All nations have\r\nfound it necessary, that for the advantageous conduct of their affairs,\r\nsome of these proceedings, at least, should remain known to their\r\nexecutive functionary only. He, of course, from the nature of the case,\r\nmust be the sole judge of which of them the public interests will permit\r\npublication. Hence, under our Constitution, in requests of papers from the\r\nlegislative to the executive branch, an exception is carefully expressed,\r\nas to those which he may deem the public welfare may require not to be\r\ndisclosed; as you will see in the enclosed resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, which produced the message of January 22d, respecting\r\nthis case. The respect mutually due between the constituted authorities,\r\nin their official intercourse, as well as sincere dispositions to do\r\nfor every one what is just, will always insure from the executive, in\r\nexercising the duty of discrimination confided to him, the same candor\r\nand integrity to which the nation has in like manner trusted in the\r\ndisposal of its judiciary authorities. Considering you as the organ for\r\ncommunicating these sentiments to the Court, I address them to you for\r\nthat purpose, and salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 17th was received last night. Three blank pardons\r\nhad been (as I expect) made up and forwarded by the mail of yesterday,\r\nand I have desired three others to go by that of this evening. You ask\r\nwhat is to be done if Bollman finally rejects his pardon, and the Judge\r\ndecides it to have no effect? Move to commit him immediately for treason\r\nor misdemeanor, as you think the evidence will support; let the Court\r\ndecide where he shall be sent for trial; and on application, I will have\r\nthe marshall aided in his transportation, with the executive means. And\r\nwe think it proper, further, that when Burr shall have been convicted\r\nof either treason or misdemeanor, you should immediately have committed\r\nall those persons against whom you should find evidence sufficient,\r\nwhose agency has been so prominent as to mark them as proper objects of\r\npunishment, and especially where their boldness has betrayed an inveteracy\r\nof criminal disposition. As to obscure offenders and repenting ones, let\r\nthem lie for consideration.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the copy of a letter received last night, and giving\r\nsingular information. I have inquired into the character of Graybell. He\r\nwas an old revolutionary captain, is now a flour merchant in Baltimore,\r\nof the most respectable character, and whose word would be taken as\r\nimplicitly as any man's for whatever he affirms. The letter writer, also,\r\nis a man of entire respectability. I am well informed, that for more than\r\na twelvemonth it has been believed in Baltimore, generally, that Burr was\r\nengaged in some criminal enterprise, and that Luther Martin knew all about\r\nit. We think you should immediately despatch a subpœna for Graybell; and\r\nwhile that is on the road, you will have time to consider in what form\r\nyou will use his testimony; _e. g._ shall Luther Martin be summoned as a\r\nwitness against Burr, and Graybell held ready to confront him? It may be\r\ndoubted whether we could examine a witness to discredit our own witness.\r\nBesides, the lawyers say that they are privileged from being forced to\r\nbreaches of confidence, and that no others are. Shall we move to commit\r\nLuther Martin, as _particeps criminis_ with Burr? Graybell will fix upon\r\nhim misprison of treason at least. And at any rate, his evidence will\r\nput down this unprincipled and impudent federal bull-dog, and add another\r\nproof that the most clamorous defenders of Burr are all his accomplices.\r\nIt will explain why Luther Martin flew so hastily to the \"aid of his\r\nhonorable friend,\" abandoning his clients and their property during a\r\nsession of a principal court in Maryland, now filled, as I am told, with\r\nthe clamors and ruin of his clients. I believe we shall send on Latrobe as\r\na witness. He will prove that Aaron Burr endeavored to get him to engage\r\nseveral thousand men, chiefly Irish emigrants, whom he had been in the\r\nhabit of employing in the works he directs, under pretence of a canal\r\nopposite Louisville, or of the Washita, in which, had he succeeded, he\r\ncould with that force alone have carried everything before him, and would\r\nnot have been where he now is. He knows, too, of certain meetings of Burr,\r\nBollman, Yrujo, and one other whom we have never named yet, but have him\r\nnot the less in our view.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. Will you send us half a dozen blank subpœnas?\r\n\r\nSince writing the within I have had a conversation with Latrobe. He says\r\nit was five hundred men he was desired to engage. The pretexts were, to\r\nwork on the Ohio canal, and be paid in Washita lands. Your witnesses will\r\nsome of them prove that Burr had no interest in the Ohio canal, and that\r\nconsequently this was a mere pretext to cover the real object from the men\r\nthemselves, and all others. Latrobe will set out in the stage of to-morrow\r\nevening, and be with you Monday evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In acknowledging the receipt of your favor of the 3d instant,\r\nI avail myself of the occasion it offers of tendering to yourself, to\r\nMr. Lincoln and to your State, my sincere congratulations on the late\r\nhappy event of the election of a republican executive to preside over\r\nits councils. The harmony it has introduced between the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches, between the people and both of them, and between\r\nall and the General Government, are so many steps towards securing that\r\nunion of action and effort in all its parts, without which no nation can\r\nbe happy or safe. The just respect with which all the States have ever\r\nlooked to Massachusetts, could leave none of them without anxiety, while\r\nshe was in a state of alienation from her family and friends. Your opinion\r\nof the propriety and advantage of a more intimate correspondence between\r\nthe executives of the several States, and that of the Union, as a central\r\npoint, is precisely that which I have ever entertained; and on coming into\r\noffice I felt the advantages which would result from that harmony. I had\r\nit even in contemplation, after the annual recommendation to Congress of\r\nthose measures called for by the times, which the Constitution had placed\r\nunder their power, to make communications in like manner to the executives\r\nof the States, as to any parts of them to which the legislatures might\r\nbe alone competent. For many are the exercises of power reserved to\r\nthe States, wherein an uniformity of proceeding would be advantageous\r\nto all. Such are quarantines, health laws, regulations of the press,\r\nbanking institutions, training militia, &c., &c. But you know what was\r\nthe state of the several governments when I came into office. That a great\r\nproportion of them were federal, and would have been delighted with such\r\nopportunities of proclaiming their contempt, and of opposing republican\r\nmen and measures. Opportunities so furnished and used by some of the State\r\nGovernments, would have produced an ill effect, and would have insured\r\nthe failure of the object of uniform proceeding. If it could be ventured\r\neven now (Connecticut and Delaware being still hostile) it must be on\r\nsome greater occasion than is likely to arise within my time. I look\r\nto it, therefore, as a course which will probably be to be left to the\r\nconsideration of my successor.\r\n\r\nI consider, with you, the federalists as completely vanquished, and never\r\nmore to take the field under their own banners. They will now reserve\r\nthemselves to profit by the schisms among republicans, and to earn favors\r\nfrom minorities, whom they will enable to triumph over their more numerous\r\nantagonists. So long as republican minorities barely accept their votes,\r\nno great harm will be done; because it will only place in power one shade\r\nof republicanism, instead of another. But when they purchase the votes\r\nof the federalists, by giving them a participation of office, trust and\r\npower, it is a proof that anti-monarchism is not their strongest passion.\r\nI do not think that the republican minority in Pennsylvania has fallen\r\ninto this heresy, nor that there are in your State materials of which a\r\nminority can be made who will fall into it.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the tour my friends to the north have proposed that I\r\nshould make in that quarter, I have not made up a final opinion. The\r\ncourse of life which General Washington had run, civil and military,\r\nthe services he had rendered, and the space he therefore occupied in the\r\naffections of his fellow citizens, take from his examples the weight of\r\nprecedents for others, because no others can arrogate to themselves the\r\nclaims which he had on the public homage. To myself, therefore, it comes\r\nas a new question, to be viewed under all the phases it may present.\r\nI confess that I am not reconciled to the idea of a chief magistrate\r\nparading himself through the several States, as an object of public\r\ngaze, and in quest of an applause which, to be valuable, should be purely\r\nvoluntary. I had rather acquire silent good will by a faithful discharge\r\nof my duties, than owe expressions of it to my putting myself in the way\r\nof receiving them. Were I to make such a tour to Portsmouth or Portland,\r\nI must do it to Savannah, perhaps to Orleans and Frankfort. As I have\r\nnever yet seen the time when the public business would have permitted me\r\nto be so long in a situation in which I could not carry it on, so I have\r\nno reason to expect that such a time will come while I remain in office. A\r\njourney to Boston or Portsmouth, after I shall be a private citizen, would\r\nmuch better harmonize with my feelings, as well as duties; and, founded\r\nin curiosity, would give no claims to an extension of it. I should see\r\nmy friends too more at our mutual ease, and be left more exclusively to\r\ntheir society. However, I end as I began, by declaring I have made up no\r\nopinion on the subject, and that I reserve it as a question for future\r\nconsideration and advice.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, and at all times, I salute you with great respect and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Latrobe now comes on as a witness against Burr. His\r\npresence here is with great inconvenience dispensed with, as one hundred\r\nand fifty workmen require his constant directions on various public works\r\nof pressing importance. I hope you will permit him to come away as soon\r\nas possible. How far his testimony will be important as to the prisoner, I\r\nknow not; but I am desirous that those meetings of Yrujo with Burr and his\r\nprincipal accomplices, should come fully out, and judicially, as they will\r\nestablish the just complaints we have against his nation.\r\n\r\nI did not see till last night the opinion of the Judge on the _subpœna\r\nduces tecum_ against the President. Considering the question there as\r\n_coram non judice_, I did not read his argument with much attention. Yet I\r\nsaw readily enough, that, as is usual where an opinion is to be supported,\r\nright or wrong, he dwells much on smaller objections, and passes over\r\nthose which are solid. Laying down the position generally, that all\r\npersons owe obedience to subpœnas, he admits no exception unless it can be\r\nproduced in his law books. But if the Constitution enjoins on a particular\r\nofficer to be always engaged in a particular set of duties imposed on him,\r\ndoes not this supersede the general law, subjecting him to minor duties\r\ninconsistent with these? The Constitution enjoins his constant agency\r\nin the concerns of six millions of people. Is the law paramount to this,\r\nwhich calls on him on behalf of a single one? Let us apply the Judge's own\r\ndoctrine to the case of himself and his brethren. The sheriff of Henrico\r\nsummons him from the bench, to quell a riot somewhere in his county. The\r\nfederal judge is, by the general law, a part of the _posse_ of the State\r\nsheriff. Would the Judge abandon major duties to perform lesser ones?\r\nAgain; the court of Orleans or Maine commands, by subpœnas, the attendance\r\nof all the judges of the Supreme Court. Would they abandon their posts\r\nas judges, and the interests of millions committed to them, to serve the\r\npurposes of a single individual? The leading principle of our Constitution\r\nis the independence of the Legislature, executive and judiciary of each\r\nother, and none are more jealous of this than the judiciary. But would\r\nthe executive be independent of the judiciary, if he were subject to the\r\n_commands_ of the latter, and to imprisonment for disobedience; if the\r\nseveral courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him constantly\r\ntrudging from north to south and east to west, and withdraw him entirely\r\nfrom his constitutional duties? The intention of the Constitution, that\r\neach branch should be independent of the others, is further manifested by\r\nthe means it has furnished to each, to protect itself from enterprises\r\nof force attempted on them by the others, and to none has it given more\r\neffectual or diversified means than to the executive. Again; because\r\nministers can go into a court in London as witnesses, without interruption\r\nto their executive duties, it is inferred that they would go to a court\r\none thousand or one thousand five hundred miles off, and that ours are\r\nto be dragged from Maine to Orleans by every criminal who will swear that\r\ntheir testimony \"may be of use to him.\" The Judge says, \"_it is apparent_\r\nthat the President's duties as chief magistrate do not demand his whole\r\ntime, and are not unremitting.\" If he alludes to our annual retirement\r\nfrom the seat of government, during the sickly season, he should be told\r\nthat such arrangements are made for carrying on the public business, at\r\nand between the several stations we take, that it goes on as unremittingly\r\nthere, as if we were at the seat of government. I pass more hours in\r\npublic business at Monticello than I do here, every day; and it is much\r\nmore laborious, because all must be done in writing. Our stations being\r\nknown, all communications come to them regularly, as to fixed points. It\r\nwould be very different were we always on the road, or placed in the noisy\r\nand crowded taverns where courts are held. Mr. Rodney is expected here\r\nevery hour, having been kept away by a sick child.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WISTAR.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have a grandson, the son of Mr. Randolph, now about fifteen\r\nyears of age, in whose education I take a lively interest. * * * * * I am\r\nnot a friend to placing young men in populous cities, because they acquire\r\nthere habits and partialities which do not contribute to the happiness\r\nof their after life. But there are particular branches of science, which\r\nare not so advantageously taught anywhere else in the United States as\r\nin Philadelphia. The garden at the Woodlands for Botany, Mr. Peale's\r\nMuseum for Natural History, your Medical school for Anatomy, and the able\r\nprofessors in all of them, give advantages not to be found elsewhere. We\r\npropose, therefore, to send him to Philadelphia to attend the schools\r\nof Botany, Natural History, Anatomy, and perhaps Surgery; but not of\r\nMedicine. And why not of Medicine, you will ask? Being led to the subject,\r\nI will avail myself of the occasion to express my opinions on that\r\nscience, and the extent of my medical creed. But, to finish first with\r\nrespect to my grandson, I will state the favor I ask of you, and which is\r\nthe object of this letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis subject dismissed, I may now take up that which it led to, and\r\nfurther tax your patience with unlearned views of medicine; which, as in\r\nmost cases, are, perhaps, the more confident in proportion as they are\r\nless enlightened.\r\n\r\nWe know, from what we see and feel, that the animal body is in its organs\r\nand functions subject to derangement, inducing pain, and tending to its\r\ndestruction. In this disordered state, we observe nature providing for the\r\nre-establishment of order, by exciting some salutary evacuation of the\r\nmorbific matter, or by some other operation which escapes our imperfect\r\nsenses and researches. She brings on a crisis, by stools, vomiting, sweat,\r\nurine, expectoration, bleeding, &c., which, for the most part, ends in\r\nthe restoration of healthy action. Experience has taught us, also, that\r\nthere are certain substances, by which, applied to the living body,\r\ninternally or externally, we can at will produce these same evacuations,\r\nand thus do, in a short time, what nature would do but slowly, and do\r\neffectually, what perhaps she would not have strength to accomplish.\r\nWhere, then, we have seen a disease, characterized by specific signs\r\nor phenomena, and relieved by a certain natural evacuation or process,\r\nwhenever that disease recurs under the same appearances, we may reasonably\r\ncount on producing a solution of it, by the use of such substances as we\r\nhave found produce the same evacuation or movement. Thus, fulness of the\r\nstomach we can relieve by emetics; diseases of the bowels, by purgatives;\r\ninflammatory cases, by bleeding; intermittents, by the Peruvian bark;\r\nsyphilis, by mercury; watchfulness, by opium; &c. So far, I bow to the\r\nutility of medicine. It goes to the well-defined forms of disease, and\r\nhappily, to those the most frequent. But the disorders of the animal\r\nbody, and the symptoms indicating them, are as various as the elements\r\nof which the body is composed. The combinations, too, of these symptoms\r\nare so infinitely diversified, that many associations of them appear too\r\nrarely to establish a definite disease; and to an unknown disease, there\r\ncannot be a known remedy. Here then, the judicious, the moral, the humane\r\nphysician should stop. Having been so often a witness to the salutary\r\nefforts which nature makes to re-establish the disordered functions, he\r\nshould rather trust to their action, than hazard the interruption of that,\r\nand a greater derangement of the system, by conjectural experiments on a\r\nmachine so complicated and so unknown as the human body, and a subject\r\nso sacred as human life. Or, if the appearance of doing something be\r\nnecessary to keep alive the hope and spirits of the patient, it should be\r\nof the most innocent character. One of the most successful physicians I\r\nhave ever known, has assured me, that he used more bread pills, drops of\r\ncolored water, and powders of hickory ashes, than of all other medicines\r\nput together. It was certainly a pious fraud. But the adventurous\r\nphysician goes on, and substitutes presumption for knowledge. From the\r\nscanty field of what is known, he launches into the boundless region\r\nof what is unknown. He establishes for his guide some fanciful theory\r\nof corpuscular attraction, of chemical agency, of mechanical powers, of\r\nstimuli, of irritability accumulated or exhausted, of depletion by the\r\nlancet and repletion by mercury, or some other ingenious dream, which\r\nlets him into all nature's secrets at short hand. On the principle which\r\nhe thus assumes, he forms his table of nosology, arrays his diseases into\r\nfamilies, and extends his curative treatment, by analogy, to all the cases\r\nhe has thus arbitrarily marshalled together. I have lived myself to see\r\nthe disciples of Hoffman, Boerhaave, Stahl, Cullen, Brown, succeed one\r\nanother like the shifting figures of a magic lantern, and their fancies,\r\nlike the dresses of the annual doll-babies from Paris, becoming, from\r\ntheir novelty, the vogue of the day, and yielding to the next novelty\r\ntheir ephemeral favor. The patient, treated on the fashionable theory,\r\nsometimes gets well in spite of the medicine. The medicine therefore\r\nrestored him, and the young doctor receives new courage to proceed in\r\nhis bold experiments on the lives of his fellow creatures. I believe\r\nwe may safely affirm, that the inexperienced and presumptuous band of\r\nmedical tyros let loose upon the world, destroys more of human life in\r\none year, than all the Robinhoods, Cartouches, and Macheaths do in a\r\ncentury. It is in this part of medicine that I wish to see a reform, an\r\nabandonment of hypothesis for sober facts, the first degree of value set\r\non clinical observation, and the lowest on visionary theories. I would\r\nwish the young practitioner, especially, to have deeply impressed on his\r\nmind, the real limits of his art, and that when the state of his patient\r\ngets beyond these, his office is to be a watchful, but quiet spectator\r\nof the operations of nature, giving them fair play by a well-regulated\r\nregimen, and by all the aid they can derive from the excitement of good\r\nspirits and hope in the patient. I have no doubt, that some diseases not\r\nyet understood may in time be transferred to the table of those known.\r\nBut, were I a physician, I would rather leave the transfer to the slow\r\nhand of accident, than hasten it by guilty experiments on those who put\r\ntheir lives into my hands. The only sure foundations of medicine are,\r\nan intimate knowledge of the human body, and observation on the effects\r\nof medicinal substances on that. The anatomical and clinical schools,\r\ntherefore, are those in which the young physician should be formed. If\r\nhe enters with innocence that of the theory of medicine, it is scarcely\r\npossible he should come out untainted with error. His mind must be strong\r\nindeed, if, rising above juvenile credulity, it can maintain a wise\r\ninfidelity against the authority of his instructors, and the bewitching\r\ndelusions of their theories. You see that I estimate justly that portion\r\nof instruction which our medical students derive from your labors; and,\r\nassociating with it one of the chairs which my old and able friend,\r\nDoctor Rush, so honorably fills, I consider them as the two fundamental\r\npillars of the edifice. Indeed, I have such an opinion of the talents\r\nof the professors in the other branches which constitute the school of\r\nmedicine with you, as to hope and believe, that it is from this side of\r\nthe Atlantic, that Europe, which has taught us so many other things, will\r\nat length be led into sound principles in this branch of science, the most\r\nimportant of all others, being that to which we commit the care of health\r\nand life.\r\n\r\nI dare say, that by this time, you are sufficiently sensible that old\r\nheads as well as young, may sometimes be charged with ignorance and\r\npresumption. The natural course of the human mind is certainly from\r\ncredulity to scepticism; and this is perhaps the most favorable apology\r\nI can make for venturing so far out of my depth, and to one too, to whom\r\nthe strong as well as the weak points of this science are so familiar. But\r\nhaving stumbled on the subject in my way, I wished to give a confession of\r\nmy faith to a friend; and the rather, as I had perhaps, at times, to him\r\nas well as others, expressed my scepticism in medicine, without defining\r\nits extent or foundation. At any rate, it has permitted me, for a moment,\r\nto abstract myself from the dry and dreary waste of politics, into which\r\nI have been impressed by the times on which I happened, and to indulge\r\nin the rich fields of nature, where alone I should have served as a\r\nvolunteer, if left to my natural inclinations and partialities.\r\n\r\nI salute you at all times with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received last night yours of the 16th, and sincerely\r\ncongratulate you on your safe arrival at Richmond, against the impudent\r\nsurmises and hopes of the band of conspirators, who, because they are as\r\nyet permitted to walk abroad, and even to be in the character of witnesses\r\nuntil such a measure of evidence shall be collected as will place them\r\nsecurely at the bar of justice, attempt to cover their crimes under noise\r\nand insolence. You have indeed had a fiery trial at New Orleans, but it\r\nwas soon apparent that the clamorous were only the criminal, endeavoring\r\nto turn the public attention from themselves and their leader upon any\r\nother object.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered to the Attorney General all the papers I possessed,\r\nrespecting Burr and his accomplices, when he went to Richmond, I could\r\nonly write to him (without knowing whether he was at Philadelphia,\r\nWilmington, or Delaware) for your letter of October 21st, desired by the\r\ncourt. If you have a copy of it, and choose to give it in, it will, I\r\nthink, have a good effect; for it was my intention, if I should receive\r\nit from Mr. Rodney, not to communicate it without your consent, after I\r\nlearnt your arrival. Mr. Rodney will certainly either bring or send it\r\nwithin the course of a day or two, and it will be instantly forwarded\r\nto Mr. Hay. For the same reason, I cannot send the letter of J. P. D.,\r\nas you propose, to Mr. Hay. I do not recollect what name these initials\r\nindicate, but the paper, whatever it is, must be in the hands of Mr.\r\nRodney. Not so as to your letter to Dayton; for as that could be of no use\r\nin the prosecution, and was reserved to be forwarded or not, according to\r\ncircumstances, I retained it in my own hands, and now return it to you.\r\nIf you think Dayton's son should be summoned, it can only be done from\r\nRichmond. We have no subpœnas here. Within about a month we shall leave\r\nthis to place ourselves in healthier stations. Before that I trust you\r\nwill be liberated from your present attendance. It would have been of\r\ngreat importance to have had you here with the Secretary at War, because I\r\nam very anxious to begin such works as will render Plaquemine impregnable,\r\nand an insuperable barrier to the passage of any force up or down the\r\nriver. But the Secretary at War sets out on Wednesday, to meet with some\r\nother persons at New York, and determine on the works necessary to be\r\nundertaken to put that place _hors d'insulte_, and thence he will have\r\nto proceed northwardly, I believe. I must ask you, at your leisure, to\r\nstate to me in writing what you think will answer our views at Plaquemine,\r\nwithin the limits of expense which we can contemplate, and of which you\r\ncan form a pretty good idea.\r\n\r\nYour enemies have filled the public ear with slanders, and your mind with\r\ntrouble on that account. The establishment of their guilt will let the\r\nworld see what they ought to think of their clamors; it will dissipate the\r\ndoubts of those who doubted for want of knowledge, and will place you on\r\nhigher ground in the public estimate and public confidence. No one is more\r\nsensible than myself of the injustice which has been aimed at you. Accept,\r\nI pray you, my salutations, and assurances of respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                             June 22, 1807.\r\n\r\nI suggest to you the following, as some of the ideas which might be\r\nexpressed by General Wilkinson, in answering Governor Saludo's letter. The\r\nintroductory and concluding sentiments will best flow from the General's\r\nown feelings of the personal standing between him and Governor Saludo:\r\n\r\n\"On the transfer of Louisiana by France to the United States, according\r\nto its boundaries when possessed by France, the government of the United\r\nStates considered itself entitled as far west as the Rio Norte; but\r\nunderstanding soon after that Spain, on the contrary, claimed eastwardly\r\nto the river Sabine, it has carefully abstained from doing any act in\r\nthe intermediate country, which might disturb the existing state of\r\nthings, until these opposing claims should be explained and accommodated\r\namicably. But that the Red river and all its waters belonged to France,\r\nthat she made several settlements on that river, and held them as a part\r\nof Louisiana until she delivered that country to Spain, and that Spain,\r\non the contrary, had never made a single settlement on the river, are\r\ncircumstances so well known, and so susceptible of proof, that it was\r\nnot supposed that Spain would seriously contest the facts, or the right\r\nestablished by them. Hence our government took measures for exploring that\r\nriver, as it did that of the Missouri, by sending Mr. Freeman to proceed\r\nfrom the mouth upwards, and Lieutenant Pike from the source downwards,\r\nmerely to acquire its geography, and so far enlarge the boundaries of\r\nscience. For the day must be very distant when it will be either the\r\ninterest or the wish of the United States to extend settlements into\r\nthe interior of that country. Lieutenant Pike's orders were accordingly\r\nstrictly confined to the waters of the Red river, and, from his known\r\nobservance of orders, I am persuaded that it must have been, as he himself\r\ndeclares, by missing his way that he got on the waters of the Rio Norte,\r\ninstead of those of the Red river. That your Excellency should excuse\r\nthis involuntary error, and indeed misfortune, was expected from the\r\nliberality of your character; and the kindnesses you have shown him are\r\nan honorable example of those offices of good neighborhood on your part,\r\nwhich it will be so agreeable to us to cultivate. Accept my thanks for\r\nthem, and be assured they shall on all occasions meet a like return. To\r\nthe same liberal sentiment Lieutenant Pike must appeal for the restoration\r\nof his papers. You must have seen in them no trace of unfriendly views\r\ntowards your nation, no symptoms of any other design than of extending\r\ngeographical knowledge; and it is not in the nineteenth century, nor\r\nthrough the agency of your Excellency, that science expects to encounter\r\nobstacles. The field of knowledge is the common property of all mankind,\r\nand any discoveries we can make in it will be for the benefit of yours and\r\nof every other nation, as well as our own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 23, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In mine of the 12th I informed you I would write to the\r\nAttorney General to send on the letter of General Wilkinson of October\r\n21st, referred to in my message of January 22d. He accordingly sent\r\nme a letter of that date, but I immediately saw that it was not the\r\none desired, because it had no relation to the facts stated under that\r\nreference. I immediately, by letter, apprized him of this circumstance,\r\nand being since returned to this place, he yesterday called on me with\r\nthe whole of the papers remaining in his possession, and he assured me\r\nhe had examined carefully the whole of them, and that the one referred\r\nto in the message was not among them, nor did he know where it would be\r\nfound. These papers have been recurred to so often, on so many occasions,\r\nand some of them delivered out for particular purposes, that we find\r\nseveral missing, without being able to recollect what has been done with\r\nthem. Some of them were delivered to the Attorney of this district, to be\r\nused on the occasions which arose in the District Court, and a part of\r\nthem were filed, as is said, in their office. The Attorney General will\r\nexamine their office to day, and has written to the District Attorney to\r\nknow whether he retained any of them. No researches shall be spared to\r\nrecover this letter, and if recovered, it shall immediately be sent on\r\nto you. Compiling the message from a great mass of papers, and pressed\r\nin time, the date of a particular paper may have been mistaken, but\r\nwe all perfectly remember the one referred to in the message, and that\r\nits substance is there correctly stated. General Wilkinson probably has\r\ncopies of all the letters he wrote me, and having expressed a willingness\r\nto furnish the one desired by the Court, the defendant can still have\r\nthe benefit of it. Or should he not have the particular one on which\r\nthat passage in the message is founded, I trust that his memory would\r\nenable him to affirm that it is substantially correct. I salute you with\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BLAKE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 24, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I enclose you a petition of John Partridge, which I perceive to have\r\nbeen in your hands before, by a certificate endorsed on it. The petitioner\r\nsays the term of labor to which he was sentenced expired on the 14th\r\ninstant; that he is unable to pay the costs of prosecution, and therefore\r\nprays to be discharged. But in such cases it is usual to substitute an\r\nadditional term of confinement equivalent to that portion of the sentence\r\nwhich cannot be complied with. Pardons too for counterfeiting bank paper\r\nare yielded with much less facility than others. However, in all cases\r\nI have referred these petitions to the judges and prosecuting attorney,\r\nwho having heard all the circumstances of the case, are the best judges\r\nwhether any of them were of such a nature as ought to obtain for the\r\ncriminal a remission or abridgement of the punishment. I now enclose the\r\npapers, and ask the favor of you to take the opinion of the judges on that\r\nsubject, and to favor me with your own, which will govern me in what I do,\r\nand be my voucher for it. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                      WASHINGTON, June 25, 1807. 5.30 P. M.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am sincerely sorry that I am obliged to ask your attendance\r\nhere without a moment's avoidable delay. The capture of the Chesapeake\r\nby a British ship of war renders it necessary to have all our Council\r\ntogether. I do not suppose it will detain you long from rejoining Mrs.\r\nDearborne. The mail is closing. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                      WASHINGTON, June 25, 1807. 5.30 P. M.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am sorry to be obliged to hasten your return to this place,\r\nand pray that it maybe without a moment's avoidable delay. The capture of\r\nthe Chesapeake by a British ship of war renders it necessary to have all\r\nour Council together. The mail is closing. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor by express was safely received on Saturday night, and I\r\nam thankful to you for the attention of which it is a proof. Considering\r\nthe General and State governments as co-operators in the same holy\r\nconcerns, the interest and happiness of our country, the interchange\r\nof mutual aid is among the most pleasing of the exercises of our duty.\r\nCaptain Gordon, the second in command of the Chesapeake, has arrived\r\nhere with the details of that affair. Yet as the precaution you took of\r\nsecuring us against the accident of wanting information, was entirely\r\nproper, and the expense of the express justly a national one, I have\r\ndirected him to be paid here, so that he is enabled to refund any money\r\nyou may have advanced him. Mr. Gallatin and General Dearborne happening\r\nto be absent, I have asked their immediate attendance here, and I expect\r\nthem this day. We shall then determine on the course which the exigency\r\nand our constitutional powers call for. Whether the outrage is a proper\r\ncause of war, belonging exclusively to Congress, it is our duty not to\r\ncommit them by doing anything which would be to be retracted. We may,\r\nhowever, exercise the powers entrusted to us for preventing future insults\r\nwithin our harbors, and claim firmly satisfaction for the past. This will\r\nleave Congress free to decide whether war is the most efficacious mode\r\nof redress in our case, or whether, having taught so many other useful\r\nlessons to Europe, we may not add that of showing them that there are\r\npeaceable means of repressing injustice, by making it the interest of\r\nthe aggressor to do what is just, and abstain from future wrong. It is\r\nprobable you will hear from us in the course of the week. I salute you\r\nwith great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                              July 4, 1807.\r\n\r\nIf I understand the claim of the Creeks, it is that they shall have a\r\nright of transit across our territories, but especially along our rivers\r\nfrom the Spanish territories to their own, for goods _for their own use_,\r\nwithout paying us a duty. I think they are in the right. This is exactly\r\nwhat we are claiming of Spain, as to this very river, the Mobile. Our\r\ndoctrine is that different nations inhabiting the same river have all a\r\nnatural right to an innocent passage along it, just as individuals of the\r\nsame nation have of a river wholly within the territory of that nation. I\r\ndo not know whether our revenue law, justly construed, opposes this; but\r\nif it does not, we ought to take the case into consideration, and do what\r\nis right. It is here that the manner in which this right has been asserted\r\nby Captain Isaac, is not agreeable. But can we blame it? and ought\r\nnot those who are in the wrong to put themselves in the right, without\r\nlistening to false pride?\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 6, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I congratulate you on your safe arrival with Miss Clinton\r\nat New York, and especially on your escape from British violence. This\r\naggression is of a character so distinct from that on the Chesapeake, and\r\nof so aggravated a nature, that I consider it as a very material one to\r\nbe presented with that to the British Government. I pray you, therefore,\r\nto write me a letter, stating the transaction, and in such a form as that\r\nit may go to that Government. At the same time, I must request you to\r\ninstruct Mr. Gelston, from me, to take the affidavits of the Captain of\r\nthe revenue cutter, and of such other persons as you shall direct, stating\r\nthe same affair, and to be forwarded, in like manner, to our Minister in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen by the proclamation, the measures adopted. We act on\r\nthese principles, 1. That the usage of nations requires that we shall\r\ngive the offender an opportunity of making reparation and avoiding war.\r\n2. That we should give time to our merchants to get in their property and\r\nvessels and our seamen now afloat. And 3. That the power of declaring war\r\nbeing with the Legislature, the executive should do nothing, necessarily\r\ncommitting them to decide for war in preference of non-intercourse, which\r\nwill be preferred by a great many. They will be called in time to receive\r\nthe answer from Great Britain, unless new occurrences should render it\r\nnecessary to call them sooner.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL TATHAM.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 6, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 1st instant has been received, and I thank you for\r\nthe communication. Considering the mass of false reports in circulation,\r\nand the importance of being truly informed of the proceedings of the\r\nBritish armed vessels in the Chesapeake and its vicinities, I should\r\nbe very glad, as you are on the spot, provided with a proper vessel and\r\nmen, if you could continue watching their motions constantly, and giving\r\nme information of them. In that case it would be necessary you should\r\njournalize everything respecting them which should fall within your\r\nobservation, and enclose daily to me a copy of the observations of the\r\nday, forwarding them to the post-office of Norfolk, by every opportunity\r\noccurring. Your allowance should be exactly on the same footing as when\r\nyou were surveying the coast, and for current expenses you may draw on\r\nMr. Bedinger, Navy Agent, at Norfolk, only accompanying each draught with\r\na letter explaining generally the purpose of it, which is a constant and\r\nindispensable rule in all our departments. It will be necessary for me to\r\nask the continuance of this service from you only until I can ascertain\r\nthe course these officers mean to pursue.\r\n\r\nI salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you copies of two letters sent by express from\r\nCaptain Decatur. By these you will perceive that the British commanders\r\nhave their foot on the threshold of war. They have begun the blockade of\r\nNorfolk; have sounded the passage to the town, which appears practicable\r\nfor three of their vessels, and menace an attack on the Chesapeake and\r\nCybele. These, with four gun-boats, form the present defence, and there\r\nare four more gun-boats in Norfolk nearly ready. The four gun-boats at\r\nHampton are hauled up, and in danger, four in Mopjack bay are on the\r\nstocks. Blows may be hourly possible. In this state of things I am sure\r\nyour own feelings will anticipate the public judgment, that your presence\r\nhere cannot be dispensed with. There is nobody here who can supply your\r\nknowledge of the resources for land co-operation, and the means for\r\nbringing them into activity. Still, I would wish you would stay long\r\nenough at New York to settle with the V. P. and Colonel Williams, the plan\r\nof defence for that place; and I am in hopes you will also see Fulton's\r\nexperiments tried, and see how far his means may enter into your plan. But\r\nas soon as that is done, should matters remain in their present critical\r\nstate, I think the public interest and safety would suffer by your absence\r\nfrom us. Indeed, if the present state of things continues, I begin to fear\r\nwe shall not be justifiable in separating this autumn, and that even an\r\nearlier meeting of Congress than we had contemplated, may be requisite. I\r\nsalute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MASTERS AND OTHER OFFICERS SAILING TO AND FROM THE PORTS OF NORFOLK\r\nAND PORTSMOUTH.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe tender of your services for the erection and reparation of Fort\r\nNorfolk and works on Craney Island, and for manning the gun-boats and\r\nother vessels for the waters of Elizabeth and James rivers, are received\r\nwith great satisfaction. They are the more important, in proportion as\r\nwe have much to do in the least time possible. Knowing their peculiar\r\nvalue for manning and managing the gun-boats and other vessels, it is in\r\nthat direction I am in hopes they will have been applied, and that the\r\nnecessary aid for erecting or repairing works on the land will have been\r\nfound in the zeal of other citizens, less qualified to be useful in the\r\nemployments on the water. I return, for your country, the thanks you so\r\njustly deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--You will have received from the Secretary at War a letter,\r\nrequesting that the quota of the State of Virginia of 100,000 militia\r\nbe immediately organized and put in readiness for service at the\r\nshortest warning, but that they be not actually called out until further\r\nrequisition. The menacing attitudes which the British ships of war have\r\ntaken in Hampton Road, the actual blockade of Norfolk, and their having\r\nsounded the entrance, as if with a view to pass up to the city, render it\r\nnecessary that we should be as well prepared there as circumstances will\r\npermit. The Secretary at War being gone to New York to arrange a plan of\r\ndefence for that city, it devolves on me to request that, according to the\r\napplications you may receive from the officers charged with the protection\r\nof the place, and the information which you are more at hand to obtain\r\nthan we are here, you will order such portions of the militia as you shall\r\nthink necessary and most convenient to enter immediately on duty, for the\r\ndefence of the place and protection of the country, at the expense of the\r\nUnited States. We have, moreover, four gun-boats hauled up at Hampton, and\r\nfour others on the stocks in Matthews county, under the care of Commodore\r\nSamuel Barron, which we consider as in danger. I must request you also\r\nto order such aids of militia, on the application of that officer, as you\r\nshall think adequate to their safety. Any arms which it may be necessary\r\nto furnish to the militia for the present objects, if not identically\r\nrestored to the State, shall be returned in kind or in value by the United\r\nStates. I have thought I could not more effectually provide for the safety\r\nof the places menaced, than by committing it to your hands, as you are\r\nnearer the scene of action, have the necessary powers over the militia,\r\ncan receive information, and give aid so much more promptly than can be\r\ndone from this place. I will ask communications from time to time of your\r\nproceedings under this charge. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN J. SAUNDERS, FORT NELSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Secretary at War having proceeded to New York to make\r\narrangements for the defence of that place, your letter to him of July 4th\r\nhas been put into my hands. I see with satisfaction the promptitude with\r\nwhich you have proceeded in mounting the guns of your fort, and I will\r\ncount on your continuing your utmost exertions for putting yourself in\r\nthe best condition of defence possible. With respect to the instructions\r\nyou ask for, you will consider the proclamation of July 2d as your general\r\ninstructions, but especially you are to contribute all the means in your\r\npower towards the defence of the country, its citizens, and property,\r\nagainst any aggressions which may be attempted by the British armed\r\nvessels or any other armed force. I salute you with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL MATTHEWS.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Secretary at War having gone on to New York for the purpose of\r\nhaving that place put into a state of defence, your letter of July 4th\r\nto him has been put into my hands. I see with satisfaction that in an\r\nemergency too sudden to have been provided for by orders from hence, you\r\nhave, under the guidance of your own judgment and patriotism, taken the\r\nmeasures within your power towards supporting the rights of your country.\r\nI will pray you to consider the proclamation of July 2d as laying down\r\nthe rule of action for all our citizens, in their several authorities and\r\nstations; but that it is further desired of you to employ the means under\r\nyour command, for defence of the country, its citizens, and property,\r\nagainst all aggressions attempted by the British armed vessels or other\r\nforce. The Governor of Virginia being in a situation to act with more\r\npromptitude on any emergency which may arise, so far as respects the\r\nmilitia of the State, I have authorized and requested him to order into\r\nservice such portions of the militia as he shall think necessary, on\r\napplication from any of the persons charged with the defence of Norfolk\r\nor other places menaced. With him I recommend to you to communicate as\r\nto the militia to be employed, approving most myself whatever shall be\r\nmost effectual for repelling aggression on our peace, and maintaining\r\nthe authority of the laws. Accept my salutations, and assurances of great\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE THOMAS COOPER.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of June 23d is received. I had not before learned\r\nthat a life of Dr. Priestley had been published, or I should certainly\r\nhave procured it; for no man living had a more affectionate respect\r\nfor him. In religion, in politics, in physics, no man has rendered more\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nI had always expected that when the republicans should have put down\r\nall things under their feet, they would schismatize among themselves. I\r\nalways expected, too, that whatever names the parties might bear, the real\r\ndivision would be into moderate and ardent republicanism. In this division\r\nthere is no great evil,--not even if the minority obtain the ascendency\r\nby the accession of federal votes to their candidate; because this gives\r\nus one shade only, instead of another, of republicanism. It is to be\r\nconsidered as apostasy only when they purchase the votes of federalists,\r\nwith a participation in honor and power. The gross insult lately received\r\nfrom the English has forced the latter into a momentary coalition with the\r\nmass of republicans; but the moment we begin to act in the very line they\r\nhave joined in approving, all will be wrong, and every act the reverse of\r\nwhat it should have been. Still, it is better to admit their coalescence,\r\nand leave to themselves their short-lived existence. Both reason and the\r\nusage of nations required we should give Great Britain an opportunity\r\nof disavowing and repairing the insult of their officers. It gives us at\r\nthe same time an opportunity of getting home our vessels, our property,\r\nand our seamen,--the only means of carrying on the kind of war we should\r\nattempt. The only difference, I believe, between your opinion and mine, as\r\nto the protection of commerce, is the forcing the nation to take the best\r\nroad, and the letting them take the worse, if such is their will. I salute\r\nyou with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Considering that gun-boats will enter very materially into the\r\nsystem of defence for New York, I have thought that Commodore Rogers,\r\n(who is proceeding to that place on other business,) from his peculiar\r\nacquaintance with their operation and effect, might be useful as an\r\nassociate in your examinations of the place, and the determinations to\r\nbe formed. His opinions on that part of the subject will add weight\r\nto whatever shall be concluded. I have therefore desired him to take\r\na part with yourself, the Vice-President, and Colonel Williams, in the\r\nexaminations and consultations.\r\n\r\nI have just received a deputation from the Alexandrians, who are under\r\nuneasiness for their own unprotected situation, and asking the loan of\r\na large number of muskets and cannon. I have convinced them that a very\r\nsmall force at Digges' Point will defend them more effectually than a\r\nvery great one at their city, and that on your return we will have the\r\nplace examined, a battery established, and have small arms in readiness\r\nto be given out to them in the moment they shall be wanted to support the\r\nbattery. Indeed I think a position to be taken there is indispensable\r\nfor the safety of the Navy Yard and its contents: say a battery and\r\nblock-house. Who can we get to examine the place, and give a proper\r\nplan? This we must determine on your return. Nothing new from Norfolk.\r\nMr. Erskine has written pressingly to Commodore Douglass. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                             July 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nSomething now occurs almost every day on which it is desirable to have the\r\nopinions of the heads of departments, yet to have a formal meeting every\r\nday would consume so much of their time as to seriously obstruct their\r\nregular business. I have proposed to them, as most convenient for them,\r\nand wasting less of their time, to call on me at any moment of the day\r\nwhich suits their separate convenience, when, besides any other business\r\nthey may have to do, I can learn their opinions separately on any matter\r\nwhich has occurred, also communicate the information received daily.\r\nPerhaps you could find it more convenient, sometimes, to make your call\r\nat the hour of dinner, instead of going so much further to dine alone.\r\nYou will always find a plate and a sincere welcome. In this way, that is,\r\nsuccessively, I have to-day consulted the other gentlemen on the question\r\nwhether letters of Marque were to be considered as written within our\r\ninterdict. We are unanimously of opinion they are not. We consider them\r\nas essentially _merchant vessels_; that commerce is their main object, and\r\narms merely incidental and defensive. Affectionate salutations\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 10th of July, 1806, but supposing, from\r\nyour not acknowledging the receipt of the letter, that it had miscarried,\r\nI sent a duplicate with my subsequent one of April the 2d. These having\r\ngone by the Wasp, you will doubtless have received them. Since that, yours\r\nof May the 1st has come to hand. You will see by the despatches from the\r\ndepartment of State, earned by the armed vessel the Revenge, into what\r\na critical state our peace with Great Britain is suddenly brought, by\r\ntheir armed vessels in our waters. Four vessels of war (three of them two\r\ndeckers) closely blockade Norfolk at this instant. Of the authority under\r\nwhich this aggression is committed, their minister here is unapprized.\r\nYou will see by the proclamation of July the 2d, that (while we are\r\nnot omitting such measures of force as are immediately necessary) we\r\npropose to give Great Britain an opportunity of disavowal and reparation,\r\nand to leave the question of war, non-intercourse, or other measures,\r\nuncommitted, to the Legislature. This country has never been in such\r\na state of excitement since the battle of Lexington. In this state of\r\nthings, cordial friendship with France, and peace at least with Spain,\r\nbecome more interesting. You know the circumstances respecting this last\r\npower, which have rendered it ineligible that you should have proceeded\r\nheretofore to your destination. But this obstacle is now removed by their\r\nrecall of Yrujo, and appointment of another minister, and in the meantime,\r\nof a chargé des affaires, who has been received. The way now being open\r\nfor taking your station at Madrid, it is certainly our wish you should\r\ndo so, and that this may be more agreeable to you than your return home,\r\nas is solicited in yours of May the 1st. It is with real unwillingness we\r\nshould relinquish the benefit of your services. Nevertheless, if your mind\r\nis decidedly bent on that, we shall regret, but not oppose your return.\r\nThe choice, therefore, remains with yourself. In the meantime, your place\r\nin the joint commission being vacated by either event, we shall take\r\nthe measures rendered necessary by that. We have seen, with real grief,\r\nthe misunderstanding which has taken place between yourself and General\r\nArmstrong. We are neither qualified nor disposed to form an opinion\r\nbetween you. We regret the pain which must have been felt by persons, both\r\nof whom hold so high a place in our esteem, and we have not been without\r\nfear that the public interest might suffer by it. It has seemed, however,\r\nthat the state of Europe has been such as to admit little to be done, in\r\nmatters so distant from them.\r\n\r\nThe present alarm has had the effect of suspending our foreign commerce.\r\nNo merchant ventures to send out a single vessel; and I think it probable\r\nthis will continue very much the case till we get an answer from England.\r\nOur crops are uncommonly plentiful. That of small grain is now secured\r\nsouth of this, and the harvest is advancing here.\r\n\r\nAccept my salutations, and assurances of affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN BEATTY, FOR HIMSELF, THE OTHER OFFICERS AND PRIVATES OF THE\r\nLIGHT INFANTRY COMPANY OF GEORGETOWN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received your letter of yesterday, mentioning that you had,\r\non the 4th of July, made a tender of the services of the Light Infantry\r\nCompany of Georgetown. The circumstances of the day must apologize for its\r\nhaving escaped my recollection. This tender of service in support of the\r\nrights of our country merits and meets the highest praise; and whenever\r\nthe moment arrives in which these rights must appeal to the public arm for\r\nsupport, the spirit from which your offer flows, that which animates our\r\nnation, will be their sufficient safeguard.\r\n\r\nTo the Legislature will be rendered a faithful account of the events which\r\nhave so justly excited the sensibilities of our country, of the measures\r\ntaken to obtain reparation, and of their result; and to their wisdom will\r\nbelong the course to be ultimately pursued.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is our duty to pursue that prescribed by the existing\r\nlaws, towards which, should your services be requisite, this offer of them\r\nwill be remembered.\r\n\r\nI tender for your country the thanks so justly due to yourself, the other\r\nofficers and privates of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BIDWELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of June 27th has been duly received, and although\r\nwishing your happiness always, I cannot be altogether unpleased with a\r\ntransfer of your services to a department more pleasing to yourself,\r\nyet I cannot but lament your loss in Congress. You know that talents\r\ncannot be more useful anywhere than there; and the times seem to portend\r\nthat we may have occasion there for all we possess. You have long ago\r\nlearnt the atrocious acts committed by the British armed vessels in the\r\nChesapeake and its neighborhood. They cannot be easily accommodated,\r\nalthough it is believed that they cannot be justified by orders from their\r\ngovernment. We have acted on these principles; 1, to give that government\r\nan opportunity to disavow and make reparation; 2, to give ourselves time\r\nto get in the vessels, property and seamen, now spread over the ocean; 3,\r\nto do no act which might compromit Congress in their choice between war,\r\nnon-intercourse, or any other measure. We shall probably call them some\r\ntime in October, having regard to the return of the healthy season, and to\r\nthe receipt of an answer from Great Britain, before which they could only\r\nact in the dark. In the meantime we shall make all the preparations which\r\ntime will permit, so as to be ready for any alternative.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the British ships, in a conference with a gentleman\r\nsent to them by the Mayor of Norfolk, have solemnly protested they\r\nmean no further proceeding without further orders. But the question is\r\nwhether they will obey the proclamation? If they do not, acts of force\r\nwill probably ensue; still these may lead to nothing further, if their\r\ngovernment is just. I salute you with great affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 13, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 7th; since that we learn that the Bellone\r\nand Leopard remaining in Hampton Road, the other two vessels have returned\r\nto the Capes of Chesapeake, where they have been reinforced by another\r\nfrigate and a sloop of war, we know not from whence. This induces us to\r\nsuppose they do not mean an immediate attack on Norfolk, but to retain\r\ntheir present position till further orders from their Admiral. I am\r\ninclined to think that the body of militia now in the field in Virginia\r\nwould need to be regulated according to these views. They are in great\r\nwant of artillery, the State possessing none. Their subsistence also,\r\nand other necessary expenses, require immediate attention from us, the\r\nfinances of the State not being at all in a condition to meet these cases.\r\nWe have some applications for the loan of field-pieces. The transportation\r\nof heavy cannon to Norfolk and Hampton, is rendered difficult by the\r\nblockade of those ports. These things are of necessity reserved for your\r\ndirection on your return, as nobody here is qualified to act in them.\r\nIt gives me sincere concern that events should thus have thwarted your\r\nwishes. Should the Bellone and Leopard retire, and a disposition be shown\r\nby the British commanders to restore things to a state of peace until they\r\nhear from their government, we may go into summer quarters without injury\r\nto the public safety, having previously made all necessary arrangements.\r\nBut if the present hostile conduct is pursued, I fear we shall be obliged\r\nto keep together, or at least within consulting distance. I salute you\r\nwith sincere affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I received last night your letter of May 6th, and a vessel\r\nbeing just now sailing from Baltimore, affords me an opportunity of\r\nhastily acknowledging it. Your exhortation to make a provision of arms is\r\nundoubtedly wise, and we have not been inattentive to it. Our internal\r\nresources for cannon are great, and those for small arms considerable,\r\nand in full employment. We shall not suffer from that want, should we\r\nhave war; and of the possibility of that you will judge by the enclosed\r\nproclamation, and by what you know of the character of the English\r\ngovernment. Never since the battle of Lexington have I seen this country\r\nin such a state of exasperation as at present, and even that did not\r\nproduce such unanimity. The federalists themselves coalesce with us as\r\nto the object, though they will return to their trade of censuring every\r\nmeasure taken to obtain it. \"Reparation for the past, and security for\r\nthe future,\" is our motto; but whether they will yield it freely, or\r\nwill require resort to non-intercourse, or to war, is yet to be seen. We\r\nprepare for the last. We have actually 2,000 men in the field, employed\r\nchiefly in covering the exposed coast, and cutting off all supply to\r\nthe British vessels. We think our gun-boats at New York, (thirty-two,)\r\nwith heavy batteries along shore, and bombs, will put that city _hors de\r\ninsulte_. If you could procure, and send me a good description and drawing\r\nof one of your Prames, you would do me a most acceptable service. I\r\nsuppose them to be in fact a floating battery, rendered very manageable by\r\noars.\r\n\r\nBurr's conspiracy has been one of the most flagitious of which history\r\nwill ever furnish an example. He had combined the objects of separating\r\nthe western States from us, of adding Mexico to them, and of placing\r\nhimself at their head. But he who could expect to effect such objects\r\nby the aid of American citizens, must be perfectly ripe for Bedlam. Yet\r\nalthough there is not a man in the United States who is not satisfied of\r\nthe depth of his guilt, such are the jealous provisions of our laws in\r\nfavor of the accused, and against the accuser, that I question if he can\r\nbe convicted. Out of the forty-eight jurors who are to be summoned, he has\r\na right to choose the twelve who are to try him, and if any one of the\r\ntwelve refuses to concur in finding him guilty, he escapes. This affair\r\nhas been a great confirmation in my mind of the innate strength of the\r\nform of our government. He had probably induced near a thousand men to\r\nengage with him, by making them believe the government connived at it. A\r\nproclamation alone, by undeceiving them, so completely disarmed him, that\r\nhe had not above thirty men left, ready to go all lengths with him. The\r\nfirst enterprise was to have been the seizure of New Orleans, which he\r\nsupposed would powerfully bridle the country above, and place him at the\r\ndoor of Mexico. It has given me infinite satisfaction that not a single\r\nnative Creole of Louisiana, and but one American, settled there before\r\nthe delivery of the country to us, were in his interest. His partisans\r\nthere were made up of fugitives from justice, or from their debts, who had\r\nflocked there from other parts of the United States, after the delivery\r\nof the country, and of adventurers and speculators of all descriptions.\r\nI thank you for the volume of Memoirs you have sent me, and I will\r\nimmediately deliver that for the Phil. Society. I feel a great interest in\r\nthe publication of Turfot's works, but quite as much in your return here.\r\nYour Eleutherian son is very valuable to us, and will daily become more\r\nso. I hope there will be a reaction of good offices on him. We have heard\r\nof a great improvement in France of the furnace for heating cannon-balls,\r\nbut we can get no description of it.\r\n\r\nI salute you with sincere affection, and add assurances of the highest\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I received last night your letters of February the\r\n20th and April 29th, and a vessel just sailing from Baltimore enables me\r\nhastily to acknowledge them; to assure you of the welcome with which I\r\nreceive whatever comes from you, and the continuance of my affectionate\r\nesteem for yourself and family. I learn with much concern, indeed, the\r\nstate of Madame de La Fayette's health. I hope I have the pleasure yet to\r\ncome of learning its entire re-establishment. She is too young not to give\r\ngreat confidence to that hope.\r\n\r\nMeasuring happiness by the American scale, and sincerely wishing that\r\nof yourself and family, we had been anxious to see them established this\r\nside of the great water. But I am not certain that any equivalent can be\r\nfound for the loss of that species of society, to which our habits have\r\nbeen formed from infancy. Certainly, had you been, as I wished, at the\r\nhead of the government of Orleans, Burr would never have given me one\r\nmoment's uneasiness. His conspiracy has been one of the most flagitious\r\nof which history will ever furnish an example. He meant to separate the\r\nwestern States from us, to add Mexico to them, place himself at their\r\nhead, establish what he would deem an energetic government, and thus\r\nprovide an example and an instrument for the subversion of our freedom.\r\nThe man who could expect to effect this, with American materials, must be\r\na fit subject for Bedlam. The seriousness of the crime, however, demands\r\nmore serious punishment. Yet, although there is not a man in the United\r\nStates who doubts his guilt, such are the jealous provisions of our laws\r\nin favor of the accused against the accuser, that I question if he is\r\nconvicted. Out of forty-eight jurors to be summoned, he is to select the\r\ntwelve who are to try him, and if there be any one who will not concur\r\nin finding him guilty, he is discharged of course. I am sorry to tell\r\nyou that Bollman was Burr's right hand man in all his guilty schemes. On\r\nbeing brought to prison here, he communicated to Mr. Madison and myself\r\nthe whole of the plans, always, however, apologetically for Burr, as far\r\nas they would bear. But his subsequent tergiversations have proved him\r\nconspicuously base. I gave him a pardon, however, which covers him from\r\neverything but infamy. I was the more astonished at his engaging in this\r\nbusiness, from the peculiar motives he should have felt for fidelity. When\r\nI came into the government, I sought him out on account of the services\r\nhe had rendered you, cherished him, offered him two different appointments\r\nof value, which, after keeping them long under consideration, he declined\r\nfor commercial views, and would have given him anything for which he\r\nwas fit. Be assured he is unworthy of ever occupying again the care of\r\nany honest man. Nothing has ever so strongly proved the innate force of\r\nour form of government, as this conspiracy. Burr had probably engaged\r\none thousand men to follow his fortunes, without letting them know his\r\nprojects, otherwise than by assuring them the government approved of them.\r\nThe moment a proclamation was issued, undeceiving them, he found himself\r\nleft with about thirty desperadoes only. The people rose in mass wherever\r\nhe was, or was suspected to be, and by their own energy the thing was\r\ncrushed in one instant, without its having been necessary to employ a man\r\nof the military but to take care of their respective stations. His first\r\nenterprise was to have been to seize New Orleans, which he supposed would\r\npowerfully bridle the upper country, and place him at the door of Mexico.\r\nIt is with pleasure I inform you that not a single native Creole, and but\r\none American of those settled there before we received the place, took\r\nany part with him. His partisans were the new emigrants from the United\r\nStates and elsewhere, fugitives from justice or debt, and adventurers and\r\nspeculators of all descriptions.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a proclamation, which will show you the critical footing\r\non which we stand at present with England. Never, since the battle of\r\nLexington, have I seen this country in such a state of exasperation as at\r\npresent. And even that did not produce such unanimity. The federalists\r\nthemselves coalesce with us as to the object, although they will return\r\nto their old trade of condemning every step we take towards obtaining\r\nit. \"Reparation for the past, and security for the future,\" is our\r\nmotto. Whether these will be yielded freely, or will require resort to\r\nnon-intercourse, or to war, is yet to be seen. We have actually near two\r\nthousand men in the field, covering the exposed parts of the coast, and\r\ncutting off supplies from the British vessels.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have been very unsuccessful in my endeavors to serve Madame\r\nde Tessé in her taste for planting. A box of seeds, &c., which I sent\r\nher in the close of 1805, was carried with the vessel into England, and\r\ndischarged so late that I fear she lost their benefit for that season.\r\nAnother box, which I prepared in the autumn of 1806, has, I fear, been\r\nequally delayed from other accidents. However, I will persevere in my\r\nendeavors.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to her, M. de Tessé, Madam de La Fayette and your\r\nfamily, and accept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of constant\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 16, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 10th has been received, and I note what\r\nis said on the provision which ought to be made by us, for the militia\r\nin the field. An arrangement by the Secretary at War to meet certain\r\nother persons at New York, to concert a plan of defence for that city,\r\nhas occasioned necessarily his temporary absence from this place, and\r\nthere is no person sufficiently informed to take the necessary measures\r\nuntil his return, which will be on Tuesday or Wednesday next. I hope\r\nno great inconvenience may be experienced if it lies till then. It has\r\nbeen suggested to me that if the British vessels should be disposed to\r\nleave our waters, they might not be able to do it without some supplies,\r\nespecially of water; and it is asked whether supplies to carry them away\r\nmay be admitted? It has been answered that, on their giving assurance of\r\nimmediate departure from our waters, they may have the supplies necessary\r\nto carry them to Halifax or the West Indies. I must pray you to instruct\r\nGen. Matthews to permit it, if he be applied to. But it is best that\r\nnothing be said on this subject until an application is actually made by\r\nthem. Their retirement would prevent the necessity of a resort to force,\r\nand give us time to get in our ships, our property, and our seamen, now\r\nunder the grasp of our adversary; probably not less than 20,000 of the\r\nlatter are now exposed on the ocean, whose loss would cripple us in the\r\noutset more than the loss of several battles. However pleasing the ardor\r\nof our countrymen, as a pledge of their support, if war is to ensue, as is\r\nvery possible, we, to whom they trust for conducting their affairs to the\r\nbest advantage, should take care that it be not precipitated, while every\r\nday is restoring to us our best means for carrying it on. I salute you\r\nwith friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME DE STAEL DE HOLSTEIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 16, 1807.\r\n\r\nI have received, madam, the letter which you have done me the favor to\r\nwrite from Paris on the 24th of April, and M. le Ray de Chaumont informs\r\nme that the book you were so kind as to confide to him, not having reached\r\nNantes when he sailed, will come by the first vessel from that port to\r\nthis country. I shall read with great pleasure whatever comes from your\r\npen, having known its powers when I was in a situation to judge, nearer at\r\nhand, the talents which directed it.\r\n\r\nSince then, madam, wonderful are the scenes which have passed! Whether\r\nfor the happiness of posterity, must be left to their judgment. Even of\r\ntheir effect on those now living, we, at this distance, undertake not to\r\ndecide. Unmeddling with the affairs of other nations, we presume not to\r\nprescribe or censure their course. Happy, could we be permitted to pursue\r\nour own in peace, and to employ all our means in improving the condition\r\nof our citizens. Whether this will be permitted, is more doubtful now than\r\nat any preceding time. We have borne patiently a great deal of wrong, on\r\nthe consideration that if nations go to war for every degree of injury,\r\nthere would never be peace on earth. But when patience has begotten false\r\nestimates of its motives, when wrongs are pressed because it is believed\r\nthey will be borne, resistance becomes morality.\r\n\r\nThe grandson of Mr. Neckar cannot fail of a hearty welcome in a country\r\nwhich so much respected him. To myself, who loved the virtues and honored\r\nthe great talents of the grandfather, the attentions I received in his\r\nnatal house, and particular esteem for yourself, are additional titles\r\nto whatever service I can render him. In our cities he will find distant\r\nimitations of the cities of Europe. But if he wishes to know the nation,\r\nits occupations, manners, and principles, they reside not in the cities;\r\nhe must travel through the country, accept the hospitalities of the\r\ncountry gentlemen, and visit with them the school of the people. One year\r\nafter the present will complete for me the _quadragena stipendia_, and\r\nwill place me among those to whose hospitality I recommend the attentions\r\nof your son. He will find a sincere welcome at Monticello, where I shall\r\nthen be in the bosom of my family, occupied with my books and my farms,\r\nand enjoying, under the government of a successor, the freedom and\r\ntranquillity I have endeavored to secure for others.\r\n\r\nAccept the homage of my respectful salutations, and assurances of great\r\nesteem and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL ARMSTRONG.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I take the liberty of enclosing to your care some letters to\r\nfriends who, whether they are in Paris or not I do not know. If they are\r\nnot, I will pray you to procure them a safe delivery.\r\n\r\nYou will receive, through the department of State, information of the\r\ncritical situation in which we are with England. An outrage not to be\r\nborne has obliged us to fly to arms, and has produced such a state of\r\nexasperation, and that so unanimous, as never has been seen in this\r\ncountry since the battle of Lexington. We have between two and three\r\nthousand men on the shores of the Chesapeake, patrolling them for the\r\nprotection of the country, and for preventing supplies of any kind being\r\nfurnished to the British; and the moment our gun-boats are ready we shall\r\nendeavor by force to expel them from our waters. We now send a vessel\r\nto call upon the British government for reparation for the past outrage,\r\nand security for the future, nor will anything be deemed security but a\r\nrenunciation of the practice of taking persons out of our vessels, under\r\nthe pretence of their being English. Congress will be called some time in\r\nOctober, by which time we may have an answer from England. In the meantime\r\nwe are preparing for a state of things which will take that course,\r\nwhich either the pride or the justice of England shall give it. This will\r\noccasion a modification of your instructions, as you will learn from the\r\nSecretary of State. England will immediately seize on the Floridas as a\r\npoint d'appui to annoy us. What are we to do in that case? I think she\r\nwill find that there is no nation on the globe which can gall her so much\r\nas we can. I salute you with great affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have this moment received certain information that the\r\nBritish vessels have retired from Hampton Road. Whether they will only\r\njoin their companions in the bay, and remain there or go off, is yet to\r\nbe seen. It gives me real pain to believe that circumstances still require\r\nyour presence here. I have had a consultation this day with our colleagues\r\non that subject, and we have all but one opinion on that point. Indeed,\r\nif I regarded yourself alone, I should deem it necessary to satisfy\r\npublic opinion, that you should not be out of place at such a moment.\r\nThe arrangements for the militia, now much called for, can be properly\r\nmade only by yourself. Several other details are also at a stand. I shall\r\ntherefore hope to see you in a very few days. An important question will\r\nbe to be decided on the arrival of Decatur here, about this day se'nnight,\r\nwhether, as the retirement of the British ships from Hampton Road enables\r\nus to get our sixteen gun-boats together, we shall authorize them to use\r\nactual force against the British vessels. Present to Mrs. Dearborne, and\r\naccept yourself, my affectionate and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--Yours of the 11th is received. In appointments to public\r\noffices of mere profit, I have ever considered faithful service in either\r\nour first or second revolution as giving preference of claim, and that\r\nappointments on that principle would gratify the public, and strengthen\r\nthat confidence so necessary to enable the executive to direct the\r\nwhole public force to the best advantage of the nation. Of Mr. Bolling\r\nRobertson's talents and integrity I have long been apprized, and would\r\ngladly use them where talents and integrity are wanting. I had thought\r\nof him for the vacant place of secretary of the Orleans territory, but\r\nsupposing the salary of two thousand dollars not more than he makes by\r\nhis profession, and while remaining with his friends, I have, in despair,\r\nnot proposed it to him. If he would accept it, I should name him instantly\r\nwith the greatest satisfaction. Perhaps you could inform me on this point.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Major Gibbons, I do indeed recollect, that in some casual\r\nconversation, it was said, that the most conspicuous accomplices of Burr\r\nwere at home at his house; but it made so little impression on me, that\r\nneither the occasion nor the person is now recollected. On this subject,\r\nI have often expressed the principles on which I act, with a wish they\r\nmight be understood by the federalists in office. I have never removed\r\na man merely because he was a federalist: I have never wished them to\r\ngive a vote at an election, but according to their own wishes. But as\r\nno government could discharge its duties to the best advantage of its\r\ncitizens, if its agents were in a regular course of thwarting instead of\r\nexecuting all its measures, and were employing the patronage and influence\r\nof their offices against the government and its measures, I have only\r\nrequested they would be quiet, and they should be safe; that if their\r\nconscience urges them to take an active and zealous part in opposition,\r\nit ought also to urge them to retire from a post which they could not\r\nconscientiously conduct with fidelity to the trust reposed in them; and\r\non failure to retire, I have removed them; that is to say, those who\r\nmaintained an active and zealous opposition to the government. Nothing\r\nwhich I have yet heard of Major Gibbons places him in danger from these\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nI am much pleased with the ardor displayed by our countrymen on the late\r\nBritish outrage. It gives us the more confidence of support in the demand\r\nof _reparation_ for the past, and _security_ for the future, that is to\r\nsay, an end of impressments. If motives of either justice or interest\r\nshould produce this from Great Britain, it will save a war; but if they\r\nare refused, we shall have gained time for getting in our ships and\r\nproperty, and at least twenty thousand seamen now afloat on the ocean,\r\nand who may man two hundred and fifty privateers. The loss of these to us\r\nwould be worth to Great Britain many victories of the Nile and Trafalgar.\r\nThe meantime may also be importantly employed in preparations to enable us\r\nto give quick and deep blows.\r\n\r\nPresent to Mrs. Page, and receive yourself my affectionate and respectful\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN MORGAN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--We learn through the channel of the newspapers that Governor\r\nClaiborne having engaged in a duel, has been dangerously wounded, and the\r\nSecretary having resigned his office, the territory will in that event\r\nbe left without any executive head. It is not in my power immediately to\r\nmake provision for this unfortunate and extraordinary state to which the\r\nterritory may thus have been reduced, otherwise than by beseeching you to\r\nundertake the office of Secretary for a short time, until I can fill up\r\nthe appointment. I well know that immersed in other business, as you are,\r\nthis will greatly embarrass you; but I will not desire you to do anything\r\nmore than absolute necessity shall require, and even from that you shall\r\nbe shortly relieved by the appointment of a successor. This request is\r\nmade in the event of Governor Claiborne's wound having proved mortal. If\r\nhe is alive, the commission need not be used. I shall be anxious to hear\r\nfrom you. In the meantime accept my friendly and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of the 15th was received yesterday, and the opinion you\r\nhave given to General Matthews against allowing any intercourse between\r\nthe British Consul and the ships of his nation remaining in our waters,\r\nin defiance of our authority, is entirely approved. Certainly while they\r\nare conducting themselves as enemies _de facto_, intercourse should be\r\npermitted only as between enemies, by flags under the permission of the\r\ncommanding officers, and with their passports. My letter of the 16th\r\nmentioned a case in which a communication from the British officers should\r\nbe received if offered. A day or two ago, we permitted a parent to go on\r\nboard the Bellone with letters from the British minister, to demand a son\r\nimpressed; and others equally necessary will occur, but they should be\r\nunder the permission of some officer having command in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the disbanding some portion of the troops, although I\r\nconsider Norfolk as rendered safe by the batteries, the two frigates,\r\nthe eight gun-boats present, and nine others and a bomb-vessel which will\r\nbe there immediately, and consequently that a considerable proportion of\r\nthe militia may be spared, yet I will pray you to let that question lie a\r\nfew days, as in the course of this week we shall be better able to decide\r\nit. I am anxious for their discharge the first moment it can be done with\r\nsafety, because I know the dangers to which their health will be exposed\r\nin that quarter in the season now commencing. By a letter of the 14th\r\nfrom Col. Tatham, stationed at the vicinities of Lynhaven Bay to give us\r\ndaily information of what passes, I learn that the British officers and\r\nmen often go ashore there, that on the day preceding, 100 had been at the\r\npleasure-house in quest of fresh provisions and water, that negroes had\r\nbegun to go off to them. As long as they remain there, we shall find it\r\nnecessary to keep patroles of militia in the neighborhood sufficiently\r\nstrong to prevent them from taking or receiving supplies. I presume it\r\nwould be thought best to assign the tour for the three months to come, to\r\nthose particular corps who being habituated to the climate of that part\r\nof the country, will be least likely to suffer in their health; at the end\r\nof which time others from other parts of the country may relieve them, if\r\nstill necessary. In the meantime our gun-boats may all be in readiness,\r\nand some preparations may be made on the shore, which may render their\r\nremaining with us not eligible to themselves. These things are suggested\r\nmerely for consideration for the present, as by the close of the week\r\nI shall be able to advise you of the measures ultimately decided on. I\r\nsalute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Although I cannot always acknowledge the receipt of communications,\r\nyet I merit their continuance by making all the use of them of which\r\nthey are susceptible. Some of your suggestions had occurred, and others\r\nwill be considered. The time is coming when our friends must enable us\r\nto hear everything, and expect us to say nothing; when we shall need all\r\ntheir confidence that everything is doing which can be done, and when\r\nour greatest praise shall be, that we _appear_ to be doing nothing. The\r\nlaw for detaching one hundred thousand militia, and the appropriation\r\nfor it, and that for fortifications, enable us to do everything for\r\nland service, as well as if Congress were here; and as to naval matters,\r\ntheir opinion is known. The course we have pursued, has gained for our\r\nmerchants a precious interval to call in their property and our seamen,\r\nand the postponing the summons of Congress will aid in avoiding to give\r\ntoo quick an alarm to the adversary. They will be called, however, in good\r\ntime. Although we demand of England what is merely of right, reparation\r\nfor the past, security for the future, yet as their pride will possibly,\r\nnay probably, prevent their yielding them to the extent we shall require,\r\nmy opinion is, that the public mind, which I believe is made up for war,\r\nshould maintain itself at that point. They have often enough, God knows,\r\ngiven us cause of war before; but it has been on points which would not\r\nhave united the nation. But now they have touched a chord which vibrates\r\nin every heart. Now then is the time to settle the old and the new.\r\n\r\nI have often wished for an occasion of saying a word to you on the subject\r\nof the Emperor of Russia, of whose character and value to us, I suspect\r\nyou are not apprized correctly. A more virtuous man, I believe, does\r\nnot exist, nor one who is more enthusiastically devoted to better the\r\ncondition of mankind. He will probably, one day, fall a victim to it,\r\nas a monarch of that principle does not suit a Russian noblesse. He is\r\nnot of the very first order of understanding, but he is of a high one.\r\nHe has taken a peculiar affection to this country and its government,\r\nof which he has given me public as well as personal proofs. Our nation\r\nbeing, like his, habitually neutral, our interests as to neutral rights,\r\nand our sentiments agree. And whenever conferences for peace shall take\r\nplace, we are assured of a friend in him. In fact, although in questions\r\nof restitution he will be with England, in those of neutral rights he will\r\nbe with Bonaparte and with every other power in the world, except England;\r\nand I do presume that England will never have peace until she subscribes\r\nto a just code of marine law. I have gone into this subject, because I\r\nam confident that Russia (while her present monarch lives) is the most\r\ncordially friendly to us of any power on earth, will go furthest to serve\r\nus, and is most worthy of conciliation. And although the source of this\r\ninformation must be a matter of confidence with you, yet it is desirable\r\nthat the sentiments should become those of the nation. I salute you with\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GAINES.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 23, 1807.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson has re-examined the complaints in the memorial from\r\nTombigbee, and Mr. Gaines' explanation. The complaints are:\r\n\r\n1. That Mr. Gaines stopped a vessel having a legal permit.\r\n\r\n2. That he arrested Col. Burr militarily.\r\n\r\n3. That Mr. Small gave evidence against Col. Burr.\r\n\r\n4. That he, Mr. Small, refused a passport to a Mr. Feu.\r\n\r\n5. That he levies duties on Indian goods.\r\n\r\n6. That the people of that settlement have not the free use of the Mobile.\r\n\r\n2. That the arrest of Col. Burr was military has been disproved; but had\r\nit been so, every honest man and good citizen is bound, by any means in\r\nhis power, to arrest the author of projects so daring and dangerous.\r\n\r\n3. This complaint, as well as the preceding one, would imply a partiality\r\nfor Col. Burr, of which he hopes the petitioners were not guilty.\r\n\r\n5. The levy of duty on Indian goods is required by the laws of Congress.\r\n\r\n6. There has been a constant hope of obtaining the navigation by\r\nnegotiation, and no endeavors has been spared. Congress has not thought it\r\nexpedient as yet to plunge the nation into a war against Spain and France,\r\nor to obtain an exemption from the duty levied on the use of that river.\r\n\r\n1. On the subject of the first complaint, Mr. Gaines was giving a verbal\r\nexplanation, which Thomas Jefferson asks the favor of him to repeat.\r\n\r\n4. On this subject, also, he asks any information Mr. Gaines can give;\r\nfor though it is a matter of discretion, it should be exercised without\r\npartiality or passion. He salutes Mr. Gaines with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 24, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Yours of the 20th has been duly received. The relation in which\r\nwe stand with the British naval force within our waters is so new, that\r\ndifferences of opinion are not to be wondered at respecting the captives,\r\nwho are the subject of your letter. Are they insurgents against the\r\nauthority of the laws? Are they public enemies, acting under the orders of\r\ntheir sovereign? or will it be more correct to take their character from\r\nthe act of Congress for the preservation of peace in our harbors, which\r\nauthorizes a qualified war against persons of their demeanor, defining its\r\nobjects, and limiting its extent? Considering this act as constituting\r\nthe state of things between us and them, the captives may certainly be\r\nheld as prisoners of war. If we restore them it will be an act of favor,\r\nand not of any right they can urge. Whether Great Britain will give us\r\nthat reparation for the past and security for the future, which we have\r\ncategorically demanded, cannot as yet be foreseen; but we have believed\r\nwe should afford an opportunity of doing it, as well from justice and the\r\nusage of nations, as a respect to the opinion of an impartial world, whose\r\napprobation and esteem are always of value. This measure was requisite,\r\nalso, to produce unanimity among ourselves; for however those nearest\r\nthe scenes of aggression and irritation may have been kindled into a\r\ndesire for war at short hand, the more distant parts of the Union have\r\ngenerally rallied to the point of previous demand of satisfaction and\r\nwar, if denied. It was necessary, too, for our own interests afloat on\r\nthe ocean, and under the grasp of our adversary; and, added to all this,\r\nGreat Britain was ready armed and on our lines, while we were taken by\r\nsurprise, in all the confidence of a state of peace, and needing time to\r\nget our means into activity. These considerations render it still useful\r\nthat we should avoid every act which may precipitate immediate and general\r\nwar, or in any way shorten the interval so necessary for our own purposes;\r\nand they render it advisable that the captives, in the present instance,\r\nshould be permitted to return, with their boat, arms, &c., to their ships.\r\nWhether we shall do this a second, a third, or a fourth time, must still\r\ndepend on circumstances. But it is by no means intended to retire from\r\nthe ground taken in the proclamation. That is to be strictly adhered to.\r\nAnd we wish the military to understand that while, for special reasons,\r\nwe restore the captives in this first instance, we applaud the vigilance\r\nand activity which, by taking them, have frustrated the object of their\r\nenterprise, and urge a continuance of them, to intercept all intercourse\r\nwith the vessels, their officers and crews, and to prevent them from\r\ntaking or receiving supplies of any kind; and for this purpose, should the\r\nuse of force be necessary, they are unequivocally to understand that force\r\nis to be employed without reserve or hesitation. I salute you with great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 27, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Secretary at War having returned from New York, we have\r\nimmediately taken up the question respecting the discharge of the militia,\r\nwhich was the subject of your two last letters, and which I had wished\r\nmight remain undecided a few days. From what we have learnt of the conduct\r\nof the British squadron in the Chesapeake, since they have retired from\r\nHampton Roads, we suppose that, until orders from England, they do not\r\ncontemplate any further acts of hostility, other than those they are\r\ndaily exercising, by remaining in our waters in defiance of the national\r\nauthority, and bringing to vessels within our jurisdiction. Were they even\r\ndisposed to make an attempt on Norfolk, it is believed to be sufficiently\r\nsecured by the two frigates Cybele and Chesapeake, by the twelve gun-boats\r\nnow there, and four more from Matthews county expected,--by the works\r\nof Fort Nelson; to all of which we would wish a company of artillery, of\r\nthe militia of the place, to be retained and trained, putting into their\r\nhands the guns used at Fort Norfolk and Cape Henry, to cut off from these\r\nvessels all supplies, according to the injunctions of the proclamation,\r\nand to give immediate notice to Norfolk should any symptoms of danger\r\nappear,--to oppose which the militia of the borough and the neighboring\r\ncounties should be warned to be in constant readiness to march at a\r\nmoment's warning. Considering these provisions as quite sufficient for the\r\nsafety of Norfolk, we are of opinion that it will be better immediately\r\nto discharge the body of militia now in service, both on that and the\r\nother side of James river. This is rendered expedient, not only that we\r\nmay husband from the beginning those resources which will probably be\r\nput to a long trial, but from a regard to the health of those in service,\r\nwhich cannot fail to be greatly endangered during the sickly season now\r\ncommencing, and the discouragement, which would thence arise, to that\r\nardor of public spirit now prevailing. As to the details necessary on\r\nwinding up this service, the Secretary at War will write fully, as he\r\nwill, also, relative to the force retained in service, and whatever may\r\nhereafter concern them or their operations, which he possesses so much\r\nmore familiarly than I do, and have been gone into by myself immediately,\r\nonly on account of his absence on another service.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of the season incident to most situations on the tide-waters,\r\nnow beginning to show themselves here, and to threaten some of our\r\nmembers, together with the probability of a uniform course of things in\r\nthe Chesapeake, induce us to prepare for leaving this place during the\r\ntwo sickly months, as well for the purposes of health as to bestow some\r\nlittle attention to our private affairs, which is necessary at some time\r\nof every year. Our respective stations will be fixed and known, so that\r\neverything will find us at them, with the same certainty as if we were\r\nhere; and such measures of intercourse will be established as that the\r\npublic business will be carried on at them, with all the regularity and\r\ndispatch necessary. The present arrangements of the post office admit an\r\ninterchange of letters between Richmond and Monticello twice a week, if\r\nnecessary, and I propose that a third shall be established during the two\r\nensuing months, of which you shall be informed. My present expectation\r\nis to leave this place for Monticello, about the close of this or the\r\nbeginning of the next week. The Secretary at War will continue in this\r\nneighborhood until we shall further see that the course of things in the\r\nChesapeake will admit of his taking some respite. I salute you with great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL TATHAM.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your several letters from the 10th to the 23d, inclusive, have been\r\nduly received, and have served to regulate our belief of the state of\r\nthings in Lynhaven, amidst the variety of uncertain reports which were\r\nafloat. In mine of the 6th, I mentioned that it would be necessary for\r\nme to ask the continuance of this service from you only until I could\r\nascertain the course the squadron of Commodore Douglass meant to pursue.\r\nWe are now tolerably satisfied as to that course. From everything we\r\nhave seen, we conclude that it is not their intention to go into a state\r\nof general war, or to commit further hostilities than remaining in our\r\nwaters in defiance, and bring-to vessels within them, until they get\r\ntheir orders from England. We have therefore determined to keep up only a\r\ntroop of cavalry for patrolling the coast opposite them, and preventing\r\ntheir getting supplies, and the naval and artillery force, now in\r\nNorfolk, for its defence. In this state of things, and in consideration\r\nof the unhealthy season now approaching at this as other places on the\r\ntide-waters, and which we have always retired from about this time, the\r\nmembers of the administration, as well as myself, shall leave this place\r\nin three or four days, not to return till the sickly term is over, unless\r\nsomething extraordinary should re-assemble us. It is therefore unnecessary\r\nfor me to ask any longer the continuance of your labors. You will be so\r\ngood as to make the proper disposition of whatever articles you may have\r\nfound it necessary to procure on public account, to make up the accounts\r\nfor your services according to the principles stated in my letter of the\r\n6th, and to send them either to myself for the Navy department, or to\r\nthe head of that department directly. They would find me at Monticello.\r\nWith my thanks for the diligence with which you have executed this trust,\r\naccept my salutations and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 30, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I kept up your letter of the 23d till the return of General\r\nDearborne enabled us to give to the question of lending arms, a serious\r\nconsideration. We find that both law and expediency draw a line for\r\nour guide. In general, our magazines are open for troops, militia, or\r\nothers, when they take the field for actual service. Besides this, a law\r\nhas expressly permitted loans for training volunteers who have engaged\r\nthemselves for immediate service. The inference is, that we are not to\r\nlend to any others. And indeed, were we to lend for training the militia,\r\nour whole stock would not suffice, and not an arm would be left for real\r\nservice. You are sensible, I am sure, that however desirous we might be of\r\ngratifying the particular request you have made, yet as what we do for one\r\nwe must do for another, we could not afterwords stop.\r\n\r\nOf the measures suggested in your preceding letter, one only did not\r\nexactly meet our ideas. We thought it better not to convene Congress\r\ntill the 26th of October. Within a fortnight after that we may expect our\r\nvessel with the answer of England. Until that arrives there would be no\r\nground sufficiently certain for Congress to act on. In the meanwhile we\r\nare making every preparation which could be made were they in session.\r\nThe detachment act and its appropriation authorizes this. Congress\r\ncould not declare war without a demand of satisfaction, nor should they\r\nlay an embargo while we have so much under the grasp of our adversary.\r\nThey might, indeed, authorize the building more gun-boats; but having\r\nso lately negatived that proposition, it would not be respectful in me\r\neven to suggest it again, much less to make it the ground of convening\r\nthem. If they should change their minds, and authorize the building more,\r\n(and indeed I think two hundred more, at least, are necessary, in aid of\r\nother works, to secure our harbors,) the winter will suffice for building\r\nthem, and the winter will also enable us to do much towards batteries and\r\nfortifications, if the appropriation be made early. We find that we cannot\r\nman our gun-boats now at Norfolk. I think it will be necessary to erect\r\nour sea-faring men into a naval militia, and subject them to tours of duty\r\nin whatever port they may be.\r\n\r\nWe have been for some time under dread from the bilious season,\r\nnow commencing. Mr. Madison and Mr. Gallatin have had symptoms of\r\nindisposition. We have nearly everything so arranged as that we can carry\r\non the public affairs at our separate stations. I shall therefore leave\r\nthis on the 1st of August, for that and the ensuing month. We shall avoid,\r\nas far as we honorably can, every act which would precipitate general\r\nhostilities, and shorten the interval so necessary for our merchants\r\nto get in their property and our seamen. Accept my salutations, and\r\nassurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MASTERS OF VESSELS IN THE PORT OF CHARLESTON, S. C.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 30, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe offer of your professional services in any way most useful to your\r\ncountry, merits and meets the highest praise. Should the outrages lately\r\ncommitted by the agents of a foreign power, in the Chesapeake and its\r\nneighborhood, extend themselves to your port, your services will be\r\nvaluable towards its security; and if a general appeal is to be made to\r\nthe public arm for the support of our rights, the spirit from which your\r\noffer flows, that which animates our nation, will, I trust, be their\r\nsufficient safeguard.\r\n\r\nI tender for your country the thanks you so justly deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 31, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I shall to-morrow set out for Monticello. Considering the\r\ncritical state of things, it has been thought better, during my stay\r\nthere, to establish a _daily_ conveyance of a mail from Fredericksburg to\r\nMonticello. This enables me to hear both from the north and south every\r\nday. Should you have occasion then to communicate with me, your letters\r\ncan come to me daily by being put into the Fredericksburg mail, every day\r\nexcept that on which the mail stage leaves Richmond for Milton, by which\r\nletters of that day will come to me directly.\r\n\r\nThe course which things are likely to hold for some time has induced me to\r\ndiscontinue the establishment at Lynhaven for obtaining daily information\r\nof the movements of the squadron in that neighborhood. But still as it\r\nis expected that a troop of cavalry will patrole that coast constantly,\r\nI think it would be advisable if your Excellency would be so good as to\r\ninstruct the commanding officer of the troop to inform you daily of the\r\noccurrences of the day, sending off his letter in time to get to Norfolk\r\nbefore the post hour. This letter, after perusal for your own information,\r\nI would ask the favor of you to forward by the post of the day, under\r\ncover to me. I think a post comes one day from Norfolk by the way of\r\nPetersburg, and the next by the way of Hampton. If so, the letters may\r\ncome every day. I salute you with great and sincere esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, August 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received two days ago your letter recommendatory of Mr.\r\nWoodford. I knew his father well, and can readily believe that his merits\r\nare descended on the son, and especially after what you say of him. If we\r\ncould always have as good grounds to go upon, it would greatly relieve the\r\nterrible business of nominations. But lest you should not have attended to\r\nit, I have taken up my pen in the moment of setting out for Monticello,\r\nto remind you that whether we receive the militia or volunteers from the\r\nStates, the appointment of officers will be with them. There therefore\r\nshould be Mr. Woodford's application. Should we have war with England,\r\nregular troops will be necessary; and though in the first moments of the\r\noutrage on the Chesapeake I did not suppose it was by authority from their\r\ngovernment, I now more and more suspect it, and of course, that they will\r\nnot give the reparation for the past and security for the future, which\r\nalone may prevent war. The new depredations committing on us, with this\r\nattack on the Chesapeake, and their calling on Portugal to declare on\r\nthe one side or the other, if true, prove they have coolly calculated it\r\nwill be to their benefit to have everything on the ocean fair prize, and\r\nto support their navy by plundering all mankind. This is the doctrine of\r\n\"war in disguise,\" and I expect they are going to adopt it. It is really\r\nmortifying that we should be forced to wish success to Bonaparte, and\r\nto look to his victories as our salvation. We expect the return of the\r\nRevenge the second week in November, with their answer, or no answer,\r\nwhich will enable Congress to take their course. In the meantime, we will\r\nhave everything as ready as possible for any course they may prefer. I\r\nsalute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nI dare say that Purcell's map must be of value, and it would be well if\r\nhis representatives would publish it, but whether worth your purchase, and\r\nat what price, General Wilkinson might perhaps satisfy you. I shall write\r\nto Marentille that if you think it worth while to give him fifty thousand\r\ndollars for his project, you will inform him. In the contrary case, it\r\nmay be put away in your pigeon hole of projects. Governor Cabell, after\r\ninforming me of the orders for the discharge of the militia, except a\r\ncompany of artillery, and one of cavalry, as we directed, adds: \"I have,\r\nhowever, in pursuance of the advice of council, done what your letter\r\ndid not expressly authorize. But when I state to you the reasons which\r\ninfluenced the measure, I hope you will approve it. You relied entirely on\r\nthe troop of horse for cutting off the supplies. But we have received the\r\nmost satisfactory information of the insufficiency of cavalry to perform\r\nthat service, in consequence of the particular nature of the country in\r\nwhich they have to act. It is covered with sandbanks and hills, which,\r\nin many places (where supplies are most easily procured), render cavalry\r\nincapable of action. So severe has this service been, that it has already\r\nalmost knocked up as fine a battalion of cavalry as any in the United\r\nStates, perhaps as any in the world. Influenced by these considerations,\r\nwhich we believe had not presented themselves to your mind, because you\r\nhad not received the necessary information as to facts, the executive have\r\ncalled into service a company of infantry from the county of Princess\r\nAnne, to co-operate with the cavalry in cutting off the supplies. Since\r\ngiving these orders, I understand that General Mathews has anticipated\r\nus by calling into actual service the very force we contemplated.\" Our\r\nobject was certainly to prevent supplies, and if the means we thought of\r\nare not adequate, we should, had we known all circumstances, have provided\r\nwhat would have been effectual; for I think the point of honor requires\r\nwe should enforce the proclamation in those points in which we have\r\nforce sufficient. I shall await your opinion, however, before I answer\r\nthe Governor's letter. Information as late as August 3d, shows that the\r\nsquadron was quiet in and near the Bay, and General Thomas Hardy, to whom\r\nTazewell delivered the five men, declared to him that his objection to\r\nintercourse by flag, was that the two nations were not in a state of war,\r\nwhich alone required it. He said he expected Barclay, or General Robert\r\nLowrie, in a week to take the command. I salute you with sincere affection\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of July 31st and August 5th were received\r\nyesterday. The ground taken in conformity with the Act of Congress, of\r\nconsidering as public enemies British armed vessels in or entering our\r\nwaters, gives us the benefit of a system of rules, sanctioned by the\r\npractice of nations in a state of war, and consequently enabling us\r\nwith certainty and satisfaction to solve the different cases which may\r\noccur in the present state of things. With these rules most officers are\r\nacquainted, and especially those old enough to have borne a part in the\r\nrevolutionary war.\r\n\r\n1. As to the enemy within our waters, intercourse, according to the\r\nusages of war, can only be by flag; and the ceremonies respecting that are\r\nusually a matter of arrangement between the adverse officers commanding in\r\nthe neighborhood of each other. If no arrangement is agreed on, still the\r\nright of sending a flag is inherent in each party, whose discretion will\r\ndirect him to address it to the proper adverse authority; as otherwise\r\nit would be subject to delay or rejection. Letters addressed by flag\r\nto persons in authority with the adverse power, may be sent sealed, and\r\nshould be delivered. But, if to others, or to their own friends happening\r\nto be within the limits of the adversary, they must be open. If innocent\r\nin the judgment of the receiving officer, courtesy requires their\r\ndelivery; if otherwise, they may be destroyed or returned by him; but in\r\na case of only suspended amity, as ours, they should be returned. Letters\r\nsent from the interdicted vessels to their consul in Norfolk must be open;\r\nand the propriety of delivering them judged of by our officer, tempering\r\nhis judgment however with liberality and urbanity. Those to their minister\r\nplenipotentiary here, sealed or unsealed, should be sent to the Secretary\r\nof State without any delay. As to the demand of fugitive slaves, it was\r\nthe custom during the late war, for the owner to apply to our commander\r\nfor a flag, and to go himself with that, to exhibit his claim and receive\r\nthe fugitive. And with respect to Americans detained on board their ships,\r\nthe application should be still, as heretofore, made through the Secretary\r\nof State, to whose proper documents are to be furnished. But without\r\nwaiting for his application, the British officer, knowing them to be\r\nAmericans and freemen, cannot but feel it a duty to restore them to their\r\nliberty on their own demand.\r\n\r\n2. As to the residue of the British nation, with whom we are as yet in\r\npeace, their persons and vessels, unarmed, are free to come into our\r\ncountry without question or molestation. And even armed vessels, in\r\ndistress, or charged, under due authority, with despatches addressed to\r\nthe government of the United States, or its authorized agents, are, by\r\na proviso in the proclamation, to be received. This exception was meant\r\nto cover the British packets coming to New York, which are generally\r\narmed, as well as to keep open, through other channels, the communication\r\nbetween the governments. Such a vessel as the Columbine needs no flag,\r\nbecause she is not included in the interdict. Her repairs and supplies\r\nare to be regulated by the collector of the port, who may permit them\r\nliberally (if no abuse be justly suspected) so far as wanted to carry her\r\nback to the port from whence she came. The articles of intercourse, stay\r\nand departure, are to be specially superintended by such person as the\r\ngovernment shall authorize and instruct.\r\n\r\nI have thus far, in compliance with your request, stated the practice\r\nof nations so generally as to meet the cases which may arise in the\r\nneighborhood of Norfolk. In doing this, I may, in some cases, have\r\nmistaken the practice. Where I have done so, I mean that my opinion shall\r\nbe subject to correction from that practice. On determining that the\r\nmilitia should be disbanded, except so small a portion as would require\r\nonly a major to command, we concluded that so long as Captain Decatur\r\nshould remain in his present station, he should be the officer to receive,\r\nauthorize and regulate intercourse by flag, with the British squadron in\r\nthe Chesapeake. He has accordingly, I expect, received instructions to\r\nthat effect, from the Secretary of the Navy, and I shall communicate to\r\nhim a copy of this letter to assist him in that duty.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary at War, I presume, has written to you on the appointment of\r\na Major to command the militia retained. In your selection of the officer,\r\nI have no doubt you will be sensible of the importance of naming one of\r\nintelligence and activity, as on him we are to rely for daily information\r\nfrom that interesting quarter.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have just now received from the Secretary at War, a letter to\r\nhim from the Secretary of the territory of Louisiana, requesting him\r\nto tender to the President of the United States the services of the\r\nmembers of the Military School of the Mine à Burton, as a volunteer\r\ncorps, under the late act of Congress authorizing the acceptance of\r\nthe services of volunteer corps. As you are now proceeding to take upon\r\nyou the government of that territory, I pray you to be the bearer of my\r\nthanks to them for this offer, and to add the pleasure it gives me to\r\nreceive further their assurances that they will cordially co-operate in\r\nthe restoration of that harmony in the territory, so essential to its\r\nhappiness, and so much desired by me. They, as well as all the other\r\ninhabitants of the territory, may rest satisfied that all the authorities\r\nof the general government entertain towards them the most liberal and\r\npaternal dispositions, and wish nothing more ardently than to do for their\r\nhappiness whatever these dispositions may dictate. Want of information, or\r\nmisinformation, may defeat their first efforts towards this object, but as\r\nthey advance in obtaining more correct knowledge of their situation, they\r\nwill be able to establish for them in the end such regulations as will\r\nsecure their religious, political and civil rights.\r\n\r\nAs the direction of the militia will be in your hands, I must request you\r\nto exercise for me the powers given by the act above mentioned, respecting\r\nvolunteers, and to arrange them to the best advantage for the prompt\r\nand effectual defence of the territory. I salute you with friendship and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of yesterday was received in the course of the day. Our\r\npost-rider has not yet got to be punctual, arriving here from two to four\r\nhours later than he should do, that is to say from 3 to 5 o'clock instead\r\nof 1. I mean to propose to him that being rigorously punctual in his\r\narrival, I will always discharge him the moment he arrives, instead of\r\nkeeping him till 7 o'clock as the postmaster proposes, taking for myself\r\nthe forenoon of the succeeding day to answer every mail. I do not exactly\r\nrecollect who of the heads of departments were present, (but I think every\r\none except Mr. Gallatin,) when, conversing on the bungling conduct of our\r\nofficers with respect to Erskine's letters, and the more bungling conduct\r\nto be expected when the command should devolve on a militia major, Mr.\r\nSmith proposed that the whole regulation of flags should be confided to\r\nDecatur, which appeared to obtain the immediate assent of all. However,\r\nthe remedy is easy, and perhaps more proper on the whole. That is, to\r\nlet the commanding officer by land, as well as the one by water, have\r\nequal authority to send and receive flags. I will write accordingly to\r\nGovernor Cabell. This is the safer, as I believe T. Newton (of Congress)\r\nis the Major. General Dearborne has sent me a plan of a war establishment\r\nfor fifteen thousand regulars for garrisons, and instead of fifteen\r\nthousand others, as a disposable force, to substitute thirty-two thousand\r\ntwelve-month volunteers, to be exercised and paid three months in the\r\nyear, and consequently the costing no more than eight thousand permanent,\r\ngiving us the benefit of thirty-two thousand for any expedition, who would\r\nbe themselves nearly equal to regulars, but could on occasion be put into\r\nthe garrisons and the regulars employed in the expedition _primâ facie_. I\r\nlike it well. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\nP. S. The record of the blank commission for Marshal of North Carolina,\r\nsent to Governor Alexander, must be filled up with the name of John S.\r\nWest, the former Marshal, who has agreed to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday yours of the 7th, with the proposition\r\nfor substituting thirty-two thousand twelve-month volunteers instead of\r\nfifteen thousand regulars as a disposable force, and I like the idea much.\r\nIt will of course be a subject of consideration when we all meet again,\r\nbut I repeat that I like it greatly.\r\n\r\nOn some occasion, a little before I left Washington, when we were together\r\n(all, I think, except Mr. Gallatin, but I am not quite so sure as to\r\nyourself as the others), conversing on the bungling business which had\r\nbeen made by the officers commanding at Norfolk, with Erskine's letters,\r\nand the more bungling conduct to be expected when the command should\r\ndevolve on a militia major, Mr. Smith proposed that the whole business of\r\nflags should be committed to Decatur. This appeared to obtain at once the\r\ngeneral approbation. Thinking it so settled, on lately receiving a letter\r\nfrom Governor Cabell, asking full and explicit instructions as to the mode\r\nof intercourse, I endeavored to lay down the general rules of intercourse\r\nby flag, as well digested as I could to meet all cases, but concluded\r\nby informing him that that whole business was committed to Decatur. Mr.\r\nMadison now informs me that either not recollecting or not understanding\r\nthis to have been the arrangement, instructions have been given to the\r\nofficer commanding by land, relative to intercourse, which may produce\r\ncollision. The remedy I think is easy, and will on the whole place the\r\nmatter on more proper ground. That is, to give to the commanding officers\r\nby land as well as sea, equal authority to send and receive flags. This\r\nis the safer, as I see by the papers that Mr. Newton (of Congress) is the\r\nMajor. I shall accordingly write to Governor Cabell to-day to correct the\r\nerror, and to inform him that the two commanders stand on an equal footing\r\nin the direction of flags.\r\n\r\nI wrote you yesterday as to the additional company of infantry employed,\r\nand shall await your opinion before I say anything on it to the Governor.\r\nI salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my letter of the 7th I informed you that on consultation\r\nat Washington, it had been concluded best to commit the whole business\r\nof flags to Captain Decatur. I now find that I had not recollected our\r\nconclusion correctly, and that it had been understood that the commanding\r\nofficers by land and water, should have equal authority to license the\r\nsending and receiving flags; which is not only proper, but the more\r\nsatisfactory, as I learn by the papers that Mr. Newton, of Congress, is\r\nthe commanding Major. Will you be so good as to have him furnished with a\r\ncopy of my letter, (with a correction of the error,) that he and Captain\r\nDecatur may govern themselves by the same rules. I salute you with great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THORNWICK CHASE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On receiving tenders of service from various military corps,\r\nI have usually addressed the answer to the officer commanding them.\r\nObserving in the address of the Master Mariners of Baltimore of July\r\n16th, that being probably unorganized, no commanding officer was named,\r\nI considered the first person on the list of subscribers as a kind of\r\nforeman, and therefore addressed my answer to him. I now, with pleasure,\r\ncorrect, on reflection, that error, by enclosing a duplicate of the\r\nanswer to yourself, as the chairman whom they had chosen as the channel\r\nof communication, having nothing more at heart than to prove my respect\r\nfor yourself and the Master Mariners of Baltimore. Accept for yourself and\r\nthem the assurances of my high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Soon after my arrival here I received a letter from Governor\r\nCabell, requesting me to give such instructions for regulating the\r\nintercourse with the British squadron as might enable the officers to act\r\ncorrectly. I accordingly undertook to digest the rules of practice, as\r\nto flags, as well as I could, and so as to meet all cases, in a letter to\r\nthe Governor, a copy of which I now enclose you. Soon after sending it, I\r\nlearnt from Mr. Madison that the arrangement at Washington had not been\r\nknown or understood to exclude the officer commanding on shore from the\r\nright of communicating by flag, and that some particular orders from the\r\nWar office, respecting Mr. Erskine's letter, might produce a collision. I\r\nhave therefore written to Governor Cabell, making the correction stated\r\nat the foot of the enclosed letter, which is the safer. As Mr. Newton\r\n(of Congress) is the Major Commandant ashore, you will see by the letter\r\nthat I meant to send a copy of it to Captain Decatur, but have thought it\r\nmore proper to send it you, with a request to forward it, or a copy, to\r\nhim. Mr. Newton receiving also a copy, they will be enabled to act by one\r\nuniform rule. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In mine of the day before yesterday, I informed you that to\r\ncomply with a request of Governor Cabell, I had undertaken to lay down\r\nrules of intercourse with the British vessels, at first intended for\r\nCaptain Decatur only, but afterwards extended with equal power to the\r\nofficer commanding by land, so that each should have equal power to send\r\nand receive flags. I now send you a copy of that letter. Since that I have\r\nreceived from the Governor a letter, pointing out difficulties occurring\r\nin the execution of the Volunteer act, from the restriction of issuing\r\ncommissions until the companies be actually raised, the brigades, &c.,\r\norganized. Another difficulty, not mentioned in the letter, embarrassed\r\nhim, with respect to accepting more than the quota of each district. I\r\nlearnt, through a direct channel, that he was so seriously impressed with\r\nthese legal obstacles, that no commissions were likely to be issued, and\r\nthen, certainly, that few volunteers would be raised. In answering his\r\nletter, therefore, I have dwelt more on these points than might otherwise\r\nhave seemed necessary. I enclose the letter for your consideration, that\r\nif you find no error in it material enough to require a return of it for\r\ncorrection, you will be so good as to seal and forward it to him without\r\ndelay. But if you think anything material in it should be corrected before\r\nit is sent, I will pray you to suggest the alteration, and return me the\r\nletter. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\nP. S. Be pleased to return the Governor's letter to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 11, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 7th is received. It asks my opinion on\r\nseveral points of law arising out of the act of Congress for accepting\r\nthirty thousand volunteers. Although your own opinion, and those of some\r\nof your counsellors, more recent in the habit of legal investigation,\r\nwould be a safer guide for you than mine, unassisted by my ordinary and\r\nable associates, yet I shall frankly venture my individual thoughts on the\r\nsubject, and participate with you in any risks of disapprobation to which\r\nan honest desire of furthering the public good may expose us.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of a law, even in judiciary cases of _meum et tuum_,\r\nwhere the opposite parties have a right and counter-right in the very\r\nwords of the law, the Judge considers the intention of the law-giver as\r\nhis true guide, and gives to all the parts and expressions of the law,\r\nthat meaning which will effect, instead of defeating, its intention.\r\nBut in laws merely executive, where no private right stands in the way,\r\nand the public object is the interest of all, a much freer scope of\r\nconstruction, in favor of the intention of the law, ought to be taken, and\r\ningenuity ever should be exercised in devising constructions, which may\r\nsave to the public the benefit of the law. Its intention is the important\r\nthing: the means of attaining it quite subordinate. It often happens\r\nthat, the Legislature prescribing details of execution, some circumstance\r\narises, unforeseen or unattended to by them, which would totally frustrate\r\ntheir intention, were their details scrupulously adhered to, and deemed\r\nexclusive of all others. But constructions must not be favored which go\r\nto defeat instead of furthering the principal object of their law, and\r\nto sacrifice the end to the means. It being as evidently their intention\r\nthat the end shall be attained as that it should be effected by any given\r\nmeans, if both cannot be observed, we are equally free to deviate from the\r\none as the other, and more rational in postponing the means to the end.\r\nIn the present case, the object of the act of Congress was to relieve the\r\nmilitia at large from the necessity of leaving their farms and families,\r\nto encounter a service very repugnant to their habits, and to permit\r\nthat service to be assumed by others ardently desiring it. Both parties,\r\ntherefore, (and they comprehend the whole nation,) would willingly waive\r\nany verbal difficulties, or circumstances of detail, which might thwart\r\ntheir mutual desires, and would approve all those views of the subject\r\nwhich facilitate the attainment of their wishes.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be considered that the Constitution gives the executive\r\na general power to carry the laws into execution. If the present law\r\nhad enacted that the service of thirty thousand volunteers should be\r\naccepted, without saying anything of the means, those means would, by\r\nthe Constitution, have resulted to the discretion of the executive.\r\nSo if means specified by an act are impracticable, the constitutional\r\npower remains, and supplies them. Often the means provided specially\r\nare affirmative merely, and, with the constitutional powers, stand well\r\ntogether; so that either may be used, or the one supplementary to the\r\nother. This aptitude of means to the end of a law is essentially necessary\r\nfor those which are executive; otherwise the objection that our government\r\nis an impracticable one, would really be verified.\r\n\r\nWith this general view of our duty as executive officers, I proceed to the\r\nquestions proposed by you.\r\n\r\n1st. Does not the act of Congress contemplate the association of companies\r\nto be formed before commissions can be issued to the Captains, &c.?\r\n\r\n2d. Can battalion or field-officers be appointed by either the State or\r\nCongressional laws, but to battalions or regiments actually existing?\r\n\r\n3d. The organization of the companies into battalions and regiments\r\nbelonging to the President, can the Governor of the State issue\r\ncommissions to these officers before that organization is made and\r\nannounced to him?\r\n\r\n4th. Ought not the volunteers tendering their services, under the act\r\nof February 24th, 1807, to be accepted by the President before the\r\ncommissions can issue?\r\n\r\nHad we no other executive powers but those given in this act, the first,\r\nsecond, and third questions would present considerable difficulties,\r\ninasmuch as the act of Congress does appear, as you understand it, to\r\ncontemplate that the companies are to be associated, and the battalions,\r\nsquadrons, regiments, brigades, and divisions organized, before\r\ncommissions are to issue. And were we to stop here the law might stop\r\nalso; because I verily believe that it will be the zeal and activity\r\nalone of those destined for commands, which will give form and body to\r\nthe floating ardor of our countrymen to enter into this service, and bring\r\ntheir wills to a point of union and effect. We know from experience that\r\nindividuals having the same desires are rarely brought into an association\r\nof them, unless urged by some one assuming an agency, and that in military\r\nassociations the person of the officer is a material inducement. Whether\r\nour constitutional powers to carry the laws into execution, would not\r\nauthorize the issuing a previous commission (as they would, had nothing\r\nbeen said about commissions in the law), is a question not necessary\r\nnow to be decided; because they certainly allow us to do what will be\r\nequally effectual. We may issue instructions or warrants to the persons\r\ndestined to be captains, &c., authorizing them to superintend the\r\nassociation of the companies, and to perform the functions of a captain\r\n&c., until commissions may be regularly issued, when such a commission\r\nwill be given to the bearer, or a warrant authorizing the bearer to\r\nsuperintend the organization of the companies associated in a particular\r\ndistrict, into battalions, squadrons, &c., and otherwise to perform the\r\nfunctions of a colonel &c., until a commission may regularly issue, when\r\nsuch a commission will be given to the bearer. This is certainly within\r\nthe constitutional powers of the executive, and with such a warrant, I\r\nbelieve, the person bearing it would act with the same effect as if he had\r\nthe commission.\r\n\r\nAs to the fourth question, the execution of this law having been\r\ntransferred to the State executives, I did consider all the powers\r\nnecessary for its execution as delegated from the President to them.\r\nOf this I have been so much persuaded that, to companies offering their\r\nservices under this law, I have answered that the power of acceptance was\r\nin the Governor, and have desired them to renew their offer to him. If\r\nthe delegation of this power should be expressly made, it is hereby fully\r\ndelegated.\r\n\r\nTo the preceding I will add one other observation. As we might still\r\nbe disappointed in obtaining the whole number of 11,563, were they\r\napportioned among the several districts, and each restrained to its\r\nprecise apportionment (which some might fail to raise), I think it would\r\nbetter secure the complete object of the law to accept all proper offers,\r\nthat the excess of some districts may supply the deficiencies of others.\r\nWhen the acceptances are all brought together, the surplus, if any, will\r\nbe known, and, if not wanted by the United States, may be rejected; and\r\nin doing this, such principles of selection may be adopted as, without\r\nany imputation of partiality, may secure to us the best offers. For\r\nexample, first, we may give a preference to all those who will agree to\r\nbecome regulars, if desired. This is so obviously for the public advantage\r\nthat no one could object to it. Second, we may give a preference to\r\ntwelve-month volunteers over those for six months; and other circumstances\r\nof selection will of course arise from the face of the offers, such as\r\ndistribution, geographical position, proportion of cavalry, riflemen, &c.\r\n\r\nI have thus, without reserve, expressed my ideas on the several doubts\r\nstated in your letters, and I submit them to your consideration. They\r\nwill need it the more, as the season and other circumstances occasioning\r\nthe members of the administration to be in a state of separation at this\r\nmoment, they go without the stamp of their aid and approbation. It is our\r\nconsolation and encouragement that we are serving a just public, who will\r\nbe indulgent to any error committed honestly, and relating merely to the\r\nmeans of carrying into effect what they have manifestly willed to be a\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you all the papers received in yours of the 9th,\r\nexcept Morrison's letter on the subject of Alston, which, although\r\nexpressed to be confidential, I send to Mr. Hay under that injunction,\r\nmerely for his information, should there be other bearings on the same\r\npoint. In my conscience, I have no doubt as to his participation. To\r\nyour papers I add some others, particularly respecting the defence of\r\nSt. Mary's and Beaufort, that you may take them into consideration as a\r\npart of the general subject of defence. I sincerely wish this business\r\nof levying duty on Creek goods could be stopped. We have no right to make\r\nthem contribute to the support of our government. The conduct of Captain\r\nIsaac is nettling. But what can we do while we are in the wrong? I wonder\r\nwe hear nothing from Hawkins on the subject. I wish Governor Harrison\r\nmay be able to have the murder of the Kaskaskian by the Kickapoo settled\r\nin the Indian way. I think it would not be amiss for him to bring over\r\nDecoigne secretly by a douceur, by which he is easily influenced. I think,\r\ntoo, that if the apprehension of the murderer, Rea, could be effected by\r\nour making up Harrison's reward of three hundred dollars to one thousand,\r\nit would be well laid out. Both the Indians and our own people want some\r\nexample of punishment for the murder of an Indian. With respect to the\r\nprophet, if those who are in danger from him would settle it in their\r\nown way, it would be their affair. But we should do nothing towards it.\r\nThat kind of policy is not in the character of our government, and still\r\nless of the paternal spirit we wish to show towards that people. But\r\ncould not Harrison gain over the prophet, who no doubt is a scoundrel,\r\nand only needs his price? The best conduct we can pursue to countervail\r\nthese movements among the Indians, is to confirm our friends by redoubled\r\nacts of justice and favor, and to endeavor to draw over the individuals\r\nindisposed towards us. The operations we contemplate, should there be\r\noccasion for them, would have an imposing effect on their minds, and, if\r\nsuccessful, will indeed put them entirely in our power; if no occasion\r\narises for carrying these operations into effect, then we shall have\r\ntime enough to get the Indian mind to rights. I think it an unlucky time\r\nfor Governor Hull to press the purchase of their lands, and hope he will\r\nnot press it. That is the only point on which the Indians feel very sore\r\ntowards us. If we have war, those lands cannot now be settled; if peace,\r\nany future movement will be more favorable.\r\n\r\nI really believe that matters in the Chesapeake will remain quiet until\r\nfurther orders from England, and that so soon as you have set all works\r\nof preparation into motion, your visit to your family and affairs may be\r\nsafely made. Be so good as to inform me how I am to address letters which\r\nI wish to go to yourself personally during your absence.\r\n\r\nWishing you a happy meeting with your friends, I salute you with affection\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 16, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday your two letters without date, on the\r\nsubjects now to be answered. I do not see any objection to the appointment\r\nof Mr. Cocke, as agent at Martinique. That of a consul at Mogadore is\r\non more difficult ground. A consul in Barbary is a diplomatic character;\r\nalthough the title does not imply that. He receives a salary fixed by the\r\nLegislature; being independent of Simpson, we should have two ministers to\r\nthe same sovereign. I should therefore think it better to leave the port\r\nof Mogadore to an agent of Simpson's appointment, and under his control.\r\n\r\nIf anything Thrasonic and foolish from Spain could add to my contempt\r\nof that government, it would be the demand of satisfaction now made by\r\nForonda. However, respect to ourselves requires that the answer should be\r\ndecent, and I think it fortunate that this opportunity is given to make a\r\nstrong declaration of facts, to wit, how far our knowledge of Miranda's\r\nobjects went, what measures we took to prevent anything further, the\r\nnegligence of the Spanish agents to give us earlier notice, the measures\r\nwe took for punishing those guilty, and our quiet abandonment of those\r\ntaken by the Spaniards. But I would not say a word in recrimination as\r\nto the western intrigues of Spain. I think that is the snare intended\r\nby this protest, to make it a set-off for the other. As soon as we have\r\nall the proofs of the western intrigues, let us make a remonstrance and\r\ndemand of satisfaction, and, if Congress approves, we may in the same\r\ninstant make reprisals on the Floridas, until satisfaction for that\r\nand for spoliations, and until a settlement of boundary. I had rather\r\nhave war against Spain than not, if we go to war against England. Our\r\nsouthern defensive force can take the Floridas, volunteers for a Mexican\r\narmy will flock to our standard, and rich pabulum will be offered to our\r\nprivateers in the plunder of their commerce and coasts. Probably Cuba\r\nwould add itself to our confederation. The paper in answer to Florida\r\nshould, I think, be drawn with a view to its being laid before Congress,\r\nand published to the world as our justification against the imputation of\r\nparticipation in Miranda's projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL FULTON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 16, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of July 28th, came to hand just as I was about leaving\r\nWashington, and it has not been sooner in my power to acknowledge it. I\r\nconsider your torpedoes as very valuable means of the defence of harbors,\r\nand have no doubt that we should adopt them to a considerable degree.\r\nNot that I go the whole length (as I believe you do) of considering them\r\nas solely to be relied on. Neither a nation nor those entrusted with\r\nits affairs, could be justifiable, however sanguine its expectations,\r\nin trusting solely to an engine not yet sufficiently tried, under all\r\nthe circumstances which may occur, and against which we know not as yet\r\nwhat means of parrying may be devised. If, indeed, the mode of attaching\r\nthem to the cable of a ship be the only one proposed, modes of prevention\r\ncannot be difficult. But I have ever looked to the submarine boat as most\r\nto be depended on for attaching them, and though I see no mention of it\r\nin your letter, or your publications, I am in hopes it is not abandoned\r\nas impracticable. I should wish to see a corps of young men trained to\r\nthis service. It would belong to the engineers if at hand, but being\r\nnautical, I suppose we must have a corps of naval engineers, to practise\r\nand use them. I do not know whether we have authority to put any part of\r\nour existing naval establishment in a course of training, but it shall\r\nbe the subject of a consultation with the Secretary of the Navy. General\r\nDearborne has informed you of the urgency of our want of you at New\r\nOrleans for the locks there.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of the 11th, 12th, and 14th were received\r\nyesterday, being the first day for some days past that the obstruction of\r\nthe water-courses has permitted the post to come through. I now return you\r\nthe letters of General Matthews and Captain Hardy; I enclose you also two\r\noffers of volunteers from Montgomery and Fauquier counties, because they\r\nare expressly made under the late act of Congress. I have received a great\r\nnumber of tenders of service at a moment's warning, which, appearing to me\r\nto have relation merely to the repelling invasion in the quarter lately\r\nviolated, and not to intend an absolute engagement for twelve months,\r\nI have only accepted generally and vaguely, without relation to the\r\nVolunteer Act.\r\n\r\nYour letter mentioning the calling into service near the Capes, a company\r\nof Infantry, I enclosed to the Secretary at War for his information and\r\nopinion, and received his answer yesterday. Your observations satisfy\r\nhim that Infantry alone can be effectual in that station, and induce him\r\nto think that the company of Infantry should be a substitute for that of\r\nCavalry, and that the latter should be discharged. To the weight of his\r\nopinion and advice, as the head of the department, is added the apparent\r\nfact that the British squadron means to be quiet till orders from England,\r\nan intention much strengthened by the complexion of Captain Hardy's\r\nletter now returned. The duty therefore of husbanding our resources for\r\nthe moment of real want, requires that I should approve his opinion, and\r\nrecommend the discharge of the troop of Cavalry. The company of Infantry\r\nwill be as vigilant as they can to cut off supplies from the squadron,\r\naccording to the proclamation; and it is proper that a daily express\r\nfrom the station of the company to the Norfolk Post Office should be\r\nestablished under your Excellency's direction. I salute you with great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 14th and 15th were received yesterday. The\r\nformer is now returned. I shall, in answer to Mr. Nicholas, say that we\r\ncannot lend arms but to volunteers training for immediate service, and\r\nthat as to a deposit in his neighborhood, we shall in due time take up\r\nthat subject generally, when just attention will be paid to that section\r\nof our country. Our separation at this time having been agreed on, I\r\nsupposed it equally settled as to yourself that you also would take a\r\nrecess as soon as the affairs of your office would permit; and that no\r\nfurther approbation on my part could be wanting. However, if it were, I\r\nhope you considered my letter of the 12th as expressing it fully, so as\r\nnot to permit yourself to be detained for anything further. Wishing you\r\na pleasant journey and happy meeting with your family, I salute you with\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you the papers received yesterday. Mr. Erskine\r\ncomplains of a want of communication between the British armed vessels\r\n_in the_ Chesapeake, or _off_ the coast. If, by _off_ the coast, he means\r\nthose which, being generally in our waters, go occasionally out of them\r\nto cruize or to acquire a title to communicate with their consul, it is\r\ntoo poor an evasion for him to expect us to be the dupes of. If vessels\r\n_off_ the coast, and having never violated the proclamation, wish to\r\ncommunicate with their consul, they may send in by any vessel, without a\r\nflag. He gives a proof of their readiness to restore deserters, from an\r\ninstance of the Chichester lying along-side a wharf at Norfolk. It would\r\nhave been as applicable if Captain Stopfield and his men had been in a\r\ntavern at Norfolk. All this, too, a British sergeant _is ready_ to swear\r\nto; and further, that he saw British deserters enlisted in their British\r\nuniform, by our officer. As this fact is probably false, and can easily\r\nbe inquired into, names being given, and as the story of the Chichester\r\ncan be ascertained by Captain Saunders, suppose you send a copy of the\r\npaper to the Secretary of the Navy, and recommend to him having an inquiry\r\nmade. We ought gladly to procure evidence to hang the privates, if no\r\nobjection or difficulty occur from the place of trial. If the Driver\r\nis the scene of trial, where is she? if in our waters, we can have no\r\ncommunication with her, if out of them, it may be inconvenient to send the\r\nwitnesses. Although there is neither candor nor dignity in soliciting the\r\nvictualling the Columbine for four months for a voyage of ten days, yet I\r\nthink you had better give the permission. It is not by these huckstering\r\nmanœuvres that the great national question is to be settled. I salute you\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 2d did not reach me till yesterday. That\r\nfrom General Hall, communicating the patriotic resolutions of the\r\ncounty of Ontario, was received the day before. Considering war as one\r\nof the alternatives which Congress may adopt on the failure of proper\r\nsatisfaction for the outrages committed on us by Great Britain, I have\r\nthought it my duty to put into train every preparation for that which the\r\nexecutive powers, and the interval left for their exercise, will admit of.\r\n\r\nWhenever militia take the field of actual service, the deficiencies of\r\ntheir arms are of course supplied from the public magazines, and the law\r\nalso permits us to lend arms to _volunteers_ engaged, and training for\r\nimmediate service. In no case is the loan of arms to militia, remaining at\r\nhome, permitted or practiced.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of deposits of arms, to be resorted to when occasion\r\npresses, is within the executive direction. A distribution of these\r\ndeposits, wherever there may be occasion, and in proportion to the\r\nprobable occasion, either defensive or offensive is one of the branches\r\nof preparation which circumstances call on us to make. It will be done in\r\ndue time; and although nothing specific can now be said, yet I may safely\r\nassure you, that whenever we proceed to settle the general arrangement,\r\nthe section of country which is the subject of your letter, shall receive\r\na just portion of our attention and provisions.\r\n\r\nI learn with particular satisfaction that volunteers will be readily\r\nengaged on that part of our frontier. It is a quarter in which they will\r\nbe particularly useful. I presume that, in consequence of the call on the\r\nseveral States, the Governor will have put the engagement of volunteers\r\ninto such a course as will avail us of the favorable disposition which\r\nprevails towards that service. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                           August 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nI suppose Mr. Gamble should be told that his opinion in favor of the\r\nappointment of a Consul General for the Danish islands being founded on\r\nthe supposition of a war with England, the executive cannot at present act\r\non that ground. It would seem indeed, that in the event of war, our agent\r\nor agents in those islands would be very important persons, and should\r\ntherefore be chosen with care. I presume it would become the best office\r\nin the gift of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt will be very difficult to answer Mr. Erskine's demand respecting the\r\nwater casks in the tone proper for such a demand. I have heard of one\r\nwho, having broke his cane over the head of another, demanded payment\r\nfor his cane. This demand might well enough have made part of an offer\r\nto pay the damages done to the Chesapeake, and to deliver up the authors\r\nof the murders committed on board her. I return you the papers received\r\nyesterday. The Governor has enclosed me a letter from General Mathews of\r\nAugust 13th, mentioning the recent arrival of a ship in the Chesapeake,\r\nbearing the flag of a Vice-Admiral; from whence he concludes that Barclay\r\nis arrived. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you the papers received in your letter of the 16th.\r\nThe Secretary of State communicated to me yesterday a letter from Mr.\r\nErskine, containing assurances from Governor Thomas Hardy, that he should\r\ncarefully abstain from acts of violence unless he received orders from his\r\nsuperiors. Although Barclay's character does not give the same confidence,\r\nyet I see no reason to doubt that matters will continue, in the\r\nChesapeake, in their present train until they receive orders from their\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of August 11th, 12th, 13th, had been before\r\nacknowledged, and in mine of this morning I acknowledged yours of the\r\n16th, and returned the papers enclosed in it. Since writing that, I have\r\nreceived another letter of yours of August 11th, which, by an error of the\r\nPost Office, had been sent to a wrong office. I now enclose the papers\r\nreceived in that. They call but for one observation, which is, that the\r\nmode of communication by flag, as before directed, must be adhered to.\r\nAlthough credit and indulgence is due to the liberality of Governor T.\r\nHardy, yet armed vessels remaining within our jurisdiction in defiance\r\nof the authority of the laws, must be viewed either as rebels, or public\r\nenemies. The latter character, it is most expedient to ascribe to them;\r\nthe laws of intercourse with persons of that description are fixed and\r\nknown. If we relinquish them we shall have a new code to settle with those\r\nindividual offenders, with whom self respect forbids any intercourse but\r\nmerely for purposes of humanity. A letter which I wrote to the Secretary\r\nof State on the 17th, expressed my opinion that we should not higgle with\r\nthe Columbine as to the quantity of supplies, but let her have what she\r\nwants.\r\n\r\nThese small distresses contribute nothing to the bringing an enemy to\r\nreason. It should not be till an abuse of this liberality has taken place,\r\nthat we should be rigorous in the quantum of supplies. I salute you with\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Appleton, the writer of the enclosed letter, was well known\r\nto me at Paris, but not as a man of business. He was young, handsome, and\r\ndevoted to pleasant pursuits. He is now probably forty-five, and has since\r\nbeen in business, but with what qualifications or success I know not. He\r\nwas our consul at Calais, his brother is our consul at Leghorn, and his\r\nfather is (if living) a respectable merchant at Boston. All this leaves\r\nstill room for inquiry whether he is fit for your agent. While on the\r\nsubject, if you should be on the look-out, it may be worth your while to\r\ninquire after a Colonel Dowse, (of the same town with Fisher Ames.) He is\r\na scientific navigator, has made voyages to the East Indies, is a sensible\r\nand most upright man, a little too much wrapt up in religious reveries. He\r\nhas been most firm in his republicanism through all the storms and trials\r\nwhich those sentiments have been exposed to in that State. I write all\r\nthis from my own knowledge of him; but I do not know he would accept the\r\nplace and quit the retirement in which he has now been several years.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the copy of a letter I wrote Mr. Fulton. I wait his answer\r\nas to the submarine boat, before I make you the proposition in form.\r\nThe very name of a corps of submarine engineers would be a defence. Mr.\r\nNicholas and his family left this neighborhood in health the day I arrived\r\nin it. We do not give up the hope of seeing Mrs. Smith and yourself here.\r\nI salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On the death of Imlay, loan officer of Connecticut, Jonathan\r\nBull (Judge Bull) is well recommended as his successor by a number of\r\nrepublicans, and by Mr. Wolcott, in a special letter. A Ralph Pomeroy, of\r\nHartford, solicits it for himself, but sends no recommendations. Those of\r\nBull would leave me with little doubt of the propriety of his nomination;\r\nbut as you can so conveniently make inquiry respecting him, I will pray\r\nyou to do it, and to communicate the result to me with as little delay as\r\nconvenient, in order to preclude other solicitations.\r\n\r\nAll my information from the Capes of Chesapeake, confirms the opinion that\r\nthe present quiet train of things there is to be continued till further\r\norders. The interdicted officers are extremely averse to our mode of\r\ncommunication by flag. But being considered as enemies rather than rebels,\r\nwhile here in defiance, no other communication will be allowed. Burr's\r\ntrial goes on to the astonishment of all, as to the manner of conducting\r\nit. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nYour letter to Dayton I think perfectly right, unless, perhaps, the\r\nexpression of personal sympathy in the first page might be misconstrued,\r\nand, coupled with the circumstance that we had not yet instituted a\r\nprosecution against him, although possessed of evidence. Poor Yznardi\r\nseems to have been worked up into distraction by the persecutions of\r\nMeade. I enclose you a letter I have received from him. Also one from\r\nWarden, attested by Armstrong, by which you will see that the feuds there\r\nare not subsiding.\r\n\r\nBy yesterday's, or this day's mails, you will have received the\r\ninformation that Bonaparte has annihilated the allied armies. The result\r\nwill doubtless be peace on the continent, an army despatched through\r\nPersia to India, and the main army brought back to their former position\r\non the channel. This will oblige England to withdraw everything home, and\r\nleave us an open field. An account, apparently worthy of credit, in the\r\nAlbany paper, is, that the British are withdrawing all their cannon and\r\nmagazines from Upper Canada to Quebec, considering the former not tenable,\r\nand the latter their only fast-hold.\r\n\r\nI salute you with sincere affection.\r\n\r\nP. S. I had forgotten to express my opinion that deserters ought never\r\nto be enlisted; but I think you may go further and say to Erskine, that\r\nif ever such a practise has prevailed, it has been without the knowledge\r\nof the Government, and would have been forbidden, if known, and if any\r\nexamples of it have existed, (which is doubted,) they must have been few,\r\nor they would have become known. The case presented from the Chichester,\r\nif true, does not prove the contrary, as the persons there said to have\r\nbeen enlisted are believed to have been American citizens, who, whether\r\nimpressed or enlisted into the British service, were equally right in\r\nreturning to the duties they owed to their own country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Colonel Newton's inquiries are easily solved, I think, by\r\napplication of the principles we have assumed. 1. The _interdicted_\r\nships are _enemies_. Should they be forced, by stress of weather, to run\r\nup into safer harbors, we are to act towards them as we would towards\r\nenemies in regular war, in like case. Permit no intercourse, no supplies;\r\nand if they land, kill or capture them as enemies. If they lie still,\r\nDecatur has orders not to attack them without stating the case to me,\r\nand awaiting instructions. But if they attempt to enter Elizabeth river,\r\nhe is to attack them without waiting for instructions. 2. Other armed\r\nvessels, putting in from sea in distress, are _friends_. They must report\r\nthemselves to the collector, he assigns them their station, and regulates\r\ntheir repairs, supplies, intercourse and stay. Not needing flags, they\r\nare under the direction of the collector alone, who should be reasonably\r\nliberal as to their repairs and supplies, furnishing them for a voyage to\r\nany of their American ports; but I think with him their crews should be\r\nkept on board, and that they should not enter Elizabeth river.\r\n\r\nI remember Mr. Gallatin expressed an opinion that our negotiations with\r\nEngland should not be laid before Congress at their meeting, but reserved\r\nto be communicated all together with the answer they should send us,\r\nwhenever received. I am not of this opinion. I think, on the meeting of\r\nCongress, we should lay before them everything that has passed to that\r\nday, and place them on the same ground of information we are on ourselves.\r\nThey will then have time to bring their minds to the same state of things\r\nwith ours, and when the answer arrives, we shall all view it from the\r\nsame position. I think, therefore, you should order the whole of the\r\nnegotiation to be prepared in two copies. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday your favor of the 11th. An error of the\r\npost office had occasioned the delay. Before an impartial jury, Burr's\r\nconduct would convict himself, were not one word of testimony to be\r\noffered against him. But to what a state will our law be reduced by party\r\nfeelings in those who administer it? Why do not Blannerhassett, Dayton,\r\n&c., demand private and comfortable lodgings? In a country where an equal\r\napplication of law to every condition of man is fundamental, how could\r\nit be denied to them? How can it ever be denied to the most degraded\r\nmalefactor? The enclosed letter of James Morrison, covering a copy of\r\none from Alston to Blannerhassett, came to hand yesterday. I enclose\r\nthem, because it is proper all these papers should be in one deposit,\r\nand because you should know the case and all its bearings, that you may\r\nunderstand whatever turns up in the cause. Whether the opinion of the\r\nletter writer is sound, may be doubted. For, however these, and other\r\ncircumstances which have come to us, may induce us to believe that the\r\nbouncing letter he published, and the insolent one he wrote to me, were\r\nintended as blinds, yet they are not sufficient for legal conviction.\r\nBlannerhassett and his wife could possibly tell us enough. I commiserate\r\nthe suffering you have to go through in such a season, and salute you with\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had had the letter of Mr. Jouett of July 6th from\r\nChicago, and that from Governor Hull, of July 14th, from Detroit, under\r\nconsideration some days, when the day before yesterday I received that of\r\nthe Governor of July 25th.\r\n\r\nWhile it appeared that the workings among the Indians of that neighborhood\r\nproceeded from their prophet chiefly, and that his endeavors were directed\r\nto the restoring them to their ancient mode of life, to the feeding\r\nand clothing themselves with the produce of the chase, and refusing all\r\nthose articles of meat, drink, and clothing, which they can only obtain\r\nfrom the whites, and are now rendered necessary by habit, I thought it a\r\ntransient enthusiasm, which, if let alone, would evaporate innocently of\r\nitself; although visibly tinctured with a partiality against the United\r\nStates. But the letters and documents now enclosed give to the state of\r\nthings there a more serious aspect; and the visit of the Governor of Upper\r\nCanada, and assembling of the Indians by him, indicate the object to which\r\nthese movements are to point. I think, therefore, we can no longer leave\r\nthem to their own course, but that we should immediately prepare for war\r\nin that quarter, and at the same time redouble our efforts for peace.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, that the Governors of Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana,\r\nbe instructed immediately to have designated, according to law, such\r\nproportions of their militia as you shall think advisable, to be ready for\r\nservice at a moment's warning, recommending to them to prefer volunteers\r\nas far as they can be obtained, and of that description fitted for Indian\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThat sufficient stores of arms, ammunition and provision, be deposited\r\nin convenient places for any expedition which it may be necessary\r\nto undertake in that quarter, and for the defence of the posts and\r\nsettlements there; and that the object of these preparations be openly\r\ndeclared, as well to let the Indians understand the danger they are\r\nbringing on themselves, as to lull the suspicion of any other object.\r\n\r\nThat at the same time, and while these preparations for war are openly\r\ngoing on, Governors Hull and Harrison be instructed to have interviews by\r\nthemselves or well-chosen agents, with the chiefs of the several tribes in\r\nthat quarter, to recall to their minds the paternal policy pursued towards\r\nthem by the United States, and still meant to be pursued. That we never\r\nwished to do them an injury, but on the contrary, to give them all the\r\nassistance in our power towards improving their condition, and enabling\r\nthem to support themselves and their families; that a misunderstanding\r\nhaving arisen between the United States and the English, war may possibly\r\nensue. That in this war it is our wish the Indians should be quiet\r\nspectators, not wasting their blood in quarrels which do not concern them;\r\nthat we are strong enough to fight our own battles, and therefore ask\r\nno help; and if the English should ask theirs, it should convince them\r\nthat it proceeds from a sense of their own weakness which would not augur\r\nsuccess in the end; that at the same time, as we have learnt that some\r\ntribes are already expressing intentions hostile to the United States, we\r\nthink it proper to apprize them of the ground on which they now stand; for\r\nwhich purpose we make to them this solemn declaration of our unalterable\r\ndetermination, that we wish them to live in peace with all nations as\r\nwell as with us, and we have no intention ever to strike them or to do\r\nthem an injury of any sort, unless first attacked or threatened; but that\r\nlearning that some of them meditate war on us, we too are preparing for\r\nwar against those, and those only who shall seek it; and that if ever we\r\nare constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay\r\nit down till that tribe is exterminated, or driven beyond the Mississippi.\r\nAdjuring them, therefore, if they wish to remain on the land which covers\r\nthe bones of their fathers, to keep the peace with a people who ask their\r\nfriendship without needing it, who wish to avoid war without fearing it.\r\nIn war, they will kill some of us; we shall destroy all of them. Let them\r\nthen continue quiet at home, take care of their women and children, and\r\nremove from among them the agents of any nation persuading them to war,\r\nand let them declare to us explicitly and categorically that they will do\r\nthis: in which case, they will have nothing to fear from the preparations\r\nwe are now unwillingly making to secure our own safety?\r\n\r\nThese ideas may form the substance of speeches to be made to them, only\r\nvarying therein according to the particular circumstances and dispositions\r\nof particular tribes; softening them to some, and strengthening them as\r\nto others. I presume, too, that such presents as would show a friendly\r\nliberality should at the same time be made to those who unequivocally\r\nmanifest intentions to remain friends; and as to those who indicate\r\ncontrary intentions, the preparations made should immediately look towards\r\nthem; and it will be a subject for consideration whether, on satisfactory\r\nevidence that any tribe means to strike us, we shall not anticipate by\r\ngiving them the first blow, before matters between us and England are\r\nso far advanced as that their troops or subjects should dare to join the\r\nIndians against us. It will make a powerful impression on the Indians, if\r\nthose who spur them on to war, see them destroyed without yielding them\r\nany aid. To decide on this, the Governors of Michigan and Indiana should\r\ngive us weekly information, and the Postmaster General should immediately\r\nput the line of posts to Detroit into the most rapid motion. Attention,\r\ntoo, is requisite to the safety of the post at Michillimacinac.\r\n\r\nI send this letter open to the Secretary of State, with a desire that,\r\nwith the documents, it may be forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nat Baltimore, the Attorney General, at Wilmington, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, at New York, and finally to yourself; that it may be considered\r\nonly as the origination of a proposition to which I wish each of them to\r\npropose such amendments as their judgment shall approve, to be addressed\r\nto yourself; and that from all our opinions you will make up a general\r\none, and act on it without waiting to refer it back to me.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 30, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--There can be no doubt that Fronda's claim for the money\r\nadvanced to Lieutenant Pike should be repaid, and while his application\r\nto yourself is the proper one, we must attend to the moneys being drawn\r\nfrom the proper fund, which is that of the war department. I presume,\r\ntherefore, it will be necessary for you to apply to General Dearborne to\r\nfurnish the money. Will it not be proper to rebut Fronda's charge of this\r\ngovernment sending a spy to Santa Fé, by saying that this government has\r\nnever employed a spy in any case, and that Pike's mission was to ascend\r\nthe Arkansas and descend the Red river for the purpose of ascertaining\r\ntheir geography; that, as far as we are yet informed, he entered the\r\nwaters of the North river, believing them to be those of the Red river;\r\nand that, however certain we are of a right extending to the North river,\r\nand participating of its navigation with Spain, yet Pike's voyage was\r\nnot intended as an exercise of that right, which we notice here, merely\r\nbecause he had chosen to deny it; a question to be settled in another way.\r\n\r\nFrom the present state of the tranquillity in the Chesapeake, and the\r\nprobability of its continuance, I begin to think the daily mail may soon\r\nbe discontinued, and an extra mail once a week substituted, to leave\r\nFredericksburg Sunday morning, and Milton Wednesday morning. This will\r\ngive us two mails a week. I should propose this change for September 9th,\r\nwhich is the day I set out for Bedford, and will exactly close one month\r\nof daily mail. What do you think of it? Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 31, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Madison will have written to you on the subject of a demand\r\nof $1,000 furnished to Lieut Pike, to be repaid to Fronda, which of course\r\nmust come out of the military fund.\r\n\r\nI enclose you an application from Mr. Graham for a commission in the army\r\nfor a Mr. Lithgow, relation of Mr. Henderson, who solicits it, and who, I\r\nthink, has a just claim for the gratification.\r\n\r\nI enclose you also a letter from Captain Brent to Mr. Coles on the subject\r\nof their commissions. They presented to me a list of names engaged,\r\nand of the officers they had chosen. I do not remember the words of my\r\nanswer; but the idea meant to be expressed was only that the officers\r\nshould be commissioned. I had no idea of fixing a date for them before\r\nthey should have raised what could be accepted as a troop. They seem to\r\nhave understood the date of my acceptance as the proper date of their\r\ncommissions. I told Mr. Coles I would consult you; and that my own idea\r\nwas to inquire what was the smallest number ever admitted as a troop or\r\ncompany, and let their commissions have the date of the day on which they\r\nhad engaged that number. This may be the subject of conversation when we\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nI send you a paper on the defence of the mouth of the Chesapeake. We never\r\nexpect from the writer a detailed, well-digested and practicable plan;\r\nbut good ideas and susceptible of improvement sometimes escape from him.\r\nThe first question is, whether works on the shore of Lynhaven may not be\r\nconstructed for dislodging an enemy from that bay by throwing bombs? and\r\nwhether they can lie there in safety out of the reach of bombs? There\r\nis no other place where they can lie in safety so near the Capes, not\r\nto be in danger of being intercepted by gun-boats, and attacked with the\r\nadvantage of weather. 2d. May not artificial harbors be made on the middle\r\ngrounds and Horseshoe for the reception of gun boats, with cavaliers for\r\nthe discharge of bombs? and will not these two points and Lynhaven thus\r\ncommand all the mouth of the bay? To answer these questions will require\r\nan accurate survey of the whole field, which, if we have not, we should\r\ndirect to be made. It is an important fact that the middle grounds have\r\nbeen seen bare; and that both these and the Horseshoe are always shoal.\r\nCannot cassoons filled with stone, and of the shape of truncated wedges,\r\nbe sunk there in close order so as to enclose a harbor for gun-boats, of\r\nsuch a height as that the sea shall not go over it in the highest tides,\r\nand of base proportioned to the height and sufficient to resist the force\r\nof the water? The nearest stone is up James river above the Hundred, and\r\nup York river above West Point, from whence however it can be brought\r\nin ships of size. At New York, they calculate on depositing their stone\r\nfor from 4 to 5 cents the cubic foot. If it costs the double here, the\r\namount would not be disproportioned to the object, if we consider what a\r\nvast extent of coast on the Chesapeake and its waters will otherwise be\r\ndepredated or secured by works and troops in detail. I throw out these\r\nthoughts now that they may be under your consideration, while making up\r\nthe general statement of defensive works for the sea coast. Present my\r\nrespects to Mrs. Dearborne, and accept my affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I think with you we had better send to Algiers some of the\r\nlosing articles in order to secure peace there while it is uncertain\r\nelsewhere. While war with England is probable, everything leading to\r\nit with every other nation should be avoided, except with Spain. As to\r\nher, I think it the precise moment when we should declare to the French\r\ngovernment that we will instantly seize on the Floridas as reprisal for\r\nthe spoliations denied us, and, that if by a given day they are paid to\r\nus, we will restore all east of the Perdido, and hold the rest subject to\r\namicable discussion. Otherwise, we will hold them forever as compensation\r\nfor the spoliations. This to be a subject of consideration when we\r\nassemble.\r\n\r\nOne reason for suggesting the discontinuance of the daily post was, that\r\nit is not kept up by contract, but at the expense of the United States.\r\nBut the principal reason was to avoid giving ground for clamor. The\r\ngeneral idea is, that those who receive annual compensations should be\r\nconstantly at their posts. Our constituents might not in the first moment\r\nconsider 1st, that we all have property to take care of, which we cannot\r\nabandon for temporary salaries; 2d, that we have health to take care of,\r\nwhich at this season cannot be preserved at Washington; 3d, that while\r\nat our separate homes our public duties are fully executed, and at much\r\ngreater personal labor than while we are together when a short conference\r\nsaves a long letter. I am aware that in the present crisis some incident\r\nmight turn up where a day's delay might infinitely overweigh a month's\r\nexpense of the daily post. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. COOPER.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 9th is received, and with it the copy of\r\nDr. Priestley's Memoirs, for which I return you many thanks. I shall read\r\nthem with great pleasure, as I revered the character of no man living more\r\nthan his. With another part of your letter I am sensibly affected. I have\r\nnot here my correspondence with Governor McKean to turn to, but I have\r\nno reason to doubt that the particular letter referred to may have been\r\nsilent on the subject of your appointment as stated. The facts are these:\r\nThe opinion I have ever entertained, and still entertain as strongly as\r\never, of your abilities and integrity, was such as made it my wish, from\r\nthe moment I came to the administration, that you should be employed in\r\nsome public way. On a review, however, of all circumstances, it appeared\r\nto me that the State of Pennsylvania had occasions for your service,\r\nwhich would be more acceptable than any others to yourself because they\r\nwould leave you in the enjoyment of the society of Dr. Priestley, to which\r\nyour attachment was known. I therefore expressed my solicitude respecting\r\nyou to Governor McKean, whose desires to serve yourself and the public\r\nby employing you I knew to be great, and of course that you were an\r\nobject of mutual concern, and I received his information of having found\r\nemployment for your talents with the sincerest pleasure. But pressed as\r\nI am perpetually by an overflow of business, and adopting from necessity\r\nthe rule of never answering any letter, or part of a letter, which can\r\ndo without answer, in replying to his which related to other subjects, I\r\nprobably said nothing on that, because my former letter had sufficiently\r\nmanifested how pleasing the circumstance must be to me, and my time and\r\npractice did not permit me to be repeating things already said. This is a\r\ncandid statement of that incident, and I hope you will see in it a silence\r\naccounted for on grounds far different from that of a continuance of my\r\nestimation and good wishes, which have experienced no change. With respect\r\nto the schism among the republicans in your State, I have ever declared\r\nto both parties that I consider the general government as bound to take\r\nno part in it, and I have carefully kept both my judgment, my affections,\r\nand my conduct, clear of all bias to either. It is true, as you have\r\nheard, that a distance has taken place between Mr. Clay and myself. The\r\ncause I never could learn nor imagine. I had always known him to be an\r\nable man, and I believed him an honest one. I had looked to his coming\r\ninto Congress with an entire belief that he would be cordial with the\r\nadministration, and even before that I had always had him in my mind for\r\na high and important vacancy which had been from time to time expected,\r\nbut is only now about to take place. I feel his loss therefore with\r\nreal concern, but it is irremediable from the necessity of harmony and\r\ncordiality between those who are to manage together the public concerns.\r\nNot only his withdrawing from the usual civilities of intercourse with me,\r\n(which even the federalists with two or three exceptions keep up,) but\r\nhis open hostility in Congress to the administration, leave no doubt of\r\nthe state of his mind as a fact, although the cause be unknown. Be so good\r\nas to communicate my respects to Mr. Priestley, and to accept yourself my\r\nfriendly salutations, and assurances of unaltered esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 2, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My letter of August 28th, on the dispositions of the Indians,\r\nwas to go the rounds of all our brethren, and to be finally sent to you\r\nwith their separate opinions. I think it probable, therefore, that the\r\nenclosed extract of a letter from a priest at Detroit to Bishop Carroll,\r\nmay reach you as soon, or sooner, than that. I therefore forward it,\r\nbecause it throws rather a different light on the dispositions of the\r\nIndians from that given by Hull and Dunham. I do not think, however,\r\nthat it ought to slacken our operations, because those proposed are all\r\nprecautionary. But it ought absolutely to stop our negotiations for land\r\notherwise the Indians will think that these preparations are meant to\r\nintimidate them into a sale of their lands, an idea which would be most\r\npernicious, and would poison all our professions of friendship to them.\r\nThe immediate acquisition of the land is of less consequence to us than\r\ntheir friendship and a thorough confidence in our justice. We had better\r\nlet the purchase lie till they are in better temper. I salute you with\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, September 3.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of August 23d, 27th, 29th, and 30th, have all been\r\nreceived; the two last came yesterday. I observe that the merchants of New\r\nYork and Philadelphia think that notice of our present crisis with England\r\nshould be sent to the Straits of Sunda by a public ship, but that such a\r\nvessel going to Calcutta, or into the Bay of Bengal, would give injurious\r\nalarm; while those of Baltimore think such a vessel going to the Straits\r\nof Sunda would have the same effect. Your proposition, very happily in\r\nmy opinion, avoids the objections of all parties; will do what some think\r\nuseful and none think injurious. I therefore approve of it. To wit, that\r\nby some of the private vessels now going, instruction from the department\r\nof State be sent to our Consul at the Isle of France, to take proper\r\nmeasures to advise all our returning vessels, as far as he can, to be on\r\ntheir guard against the English, and that we now appoint and send a Consul\r\nto Batavia, to give the same notice to our vessels returning through the\r\nStraits of Sunda. For this purpose I sign a blank sheet of paper, over\r\nwhich signature the Secretary of State will have a consular commission\r\nwritten, leaving a blank for the name to be filled up by yourself with the\r\nname of such discreet and proper person as shall be willing to go. If he\r\ndoes not mean to reside there as Consul, we must bear his expenses out and\r\nin, and compensate his time. I presume you will receive this commission,\r\nand the papers you sent me through the Secretary of State, on the 8th.\r\n\r\nI approve of the orders you gave for intercepting the pirates, and that\r\nthey were given as the occasion required, without waiting to consult\r\nme, which would have defeated the object. I am very glad indeed that\r\nthe piratical vessel and some of the crew have been taken, and hope the\r\nwhole will be taken; and that this has been done by the militia. It will\r\ncontribute to show the expediency of an organized naval militia.\r\n\r\nI send you the extract of a letter I lately wrote to General Dearborne\r\non the defence of the Chesapeake. Your situation will better enable you\r\nto make inquiries into the practicability of the plan than he can. If\r\npracticable, it is all-important.\r\n\r\nI do not see the probability of receiving from Great Britain reparation\r\nfor the wrong committed on the Chesapeake, and future security for our\r\nseamen, in the same favorable light with Mr. Gallatin and yourself.\r\nIf indeed the consequence of the battle of Friedland can be to exclude\r\nher from the Baltic, she may temporize with us. But if peace among the\r\n_continental_ powers of Europe should leave her free in her intercourse\r\nwith the powers who will then be _neutral_, the present ministry, perhaps\r\nno ministry which can now be formed, will not in my opinion give us the\r\nnecessary assurance respecting our flag. In that case, it must bring on a\r\nwar soon, and if so, it can never be in a better time for us. I look to\r\nthis, therefore, as most probably now to take place, although I do most\r\nsincerely wish that a just and sufficient security may be given us, and\r\nsuch an interruption of our property avoided. I salute you with affection\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 3, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Smith's letter of August 29th and the papers it enclosed,\r\nand which are now re-enclosed, will explain to you the necessity of my\r\nconfirming his proposition as to the means of apprizing our East India\r\ncommerce of their danger, without waiting for further opinions on the\r\nsubject. You will see that it throws on you the immediate burden of\r\ngiving the necessary instructions with as little delay as possible, lest\r\nthe occasion by the vessels now sailing should be lost. Be so good as to\r\nreturn me his two letters, and to seal and forward on to him mine, and the\r\nother papers. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 3, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--After writing to Mr. Smith my letter of yesterday, by the post\r\nof that day, I received one from him now enclosed, and covering a letter\r\nfrom Mr. Crownenshield on the subject of notifying our East India trade.\r\nTo this I have written the answer herein, which I have left open for\r\nyour perusal, with Crownenshield's letter, praying that you will seal and\r\nforward them immediately, with any considerations of your own, addressed\r\nto Mr. Smith, which may aid him in the decision I refer to him. I do not\r\ngive to the newspaper and parliamentary scraps the same importance you do.\r\nI think they all refer to the convention of limits sent us in the form of\r\na project, brought forward only as a sop of the moment for Parliament and\r\nthe public. Nothing but an exclusion of Great Britain from the Baltic will\r\ndispose her to peace with us, and to defer her policy of subsisting her\r\nnavy by the general plunder of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, September 4, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had written to you yesterday on the subject of notifying\r\nour East India trade, in answer to yours of the 29th of August, and\r\napproving your proposition of giving the notice to our trade beyond the\r\nStraits of Sunda, by a consul specially sent to Batavia, and to that on\r\nthis side by our consul at the Isle of France. Since writing that letter,\r\nI have received yours of the 31st, covering Mr. Crownenshield's. This\r\nletter shows a great and intimate knowledge of the subject, and points\r\nout so many various circumstances which may require a variation in the\r\ncourse to be pursued, that it confirms me in the opinion that it must be\r\nconfided to the discretion of a well-chosen agent, governing himself by\r\ncircumstances as they may occur. I think it possible, however, from Mr.\r\nCrownenshield's letter, that we may not have done the best in our power\r\nfor notifying Madras, and the other ports in the bay of Bengal. I refer\r\nit to yourself, therefore, to decide on the advice you can so readily\r\nget at Baltimore, whether we should not despatch a third person, with\r\ninstructions to procure himself a passage in any private vessel which\r\nmay be going from this country to any port in the bay of Bengal, or to\r\nany other port from which he can probably get a passage to some port in\r\nthe bay of Bengal, and from whence he can notify the other ports in the\r\nsame bay, either by personally visiting them or by writing. Such a person\r\nshould carry with him your commission as an agent of the navy, to obtain\r\ncredence by secretly exhibiting that to those he should notify. I return\r\nyou Mr. Crownenshield's and Mr. Gallatin's letters. I shall be absent\r\nfrom this place from the 9th to the 16th inst. Mr. Madison will be with\r\nme to-morrow, on a visit of some days. I salute you with affection and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 4, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 1st came to hand yesterday. The event has been\r\n* * * * * that is to say, not only to clear Burr, but to prevent the\r\nevidence from ever going before the world. But this latter case must not\r\ntake place. It is now, therefore, more than ever indispensable, that not\r\na single witness be paid or permitted to depart until his testimony has\r\nbeen committed to writing, either as delivered in court, or as taken by\r\nyourself in the presence of any of Burr's counsel, who may choose to\r\nattend to cross-examine. These whole proceedings will be laid before\r\nCongress, that they may decide, whether the defect has been in the\r\nevidence of guilt, or in the law, or in the application of the law, and\r\nthat they may provide the proper remedy for the past and the future.\r\nI must pray you also to have an authentic copy of the record made out\r\n(without saying for what) and to send it to me; if the Judge's opinions\r\nmake out a part of it, then I must ask a copy of them, either under his\r\nhand, if he delivers one signed, or duly proved by affidavit.\r\n\r\nThe criminal is preserved to become the rallying point of all the\r\ndisaffected and the worthless of the United States, and to be the pivot\r\non which all the intrigues and the conspiracies which foreign governments\r\nmay wish to disturb us with, are to turn. If he is convicted of the\r\nmisdemeanor, the Judge must in decency give us respite by some short\r\nconfinement of him; but we must expect it to be very short. Be assured\r\nyourself, and communicate the same assurance to your colleagues, that\r\nyour and their zeal and abilities have been displayed in this affair to my\r\nentire satisfaction and your own honor.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 6, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you the letters of Mr. Granger and Mr. J. Nicholas,\r\nby the latter of which you will see that an Indian rupture in the\r\nneighborhood of Detroit becomes more probable, if it has not already taken\r\nplace. I see in it no cause for changing the opinion given in mine of\r\nAugust 28, but on the contrary, strong reason for hastening the measures\r\ntherein recommended. We must make ever memorable examples of the tribe or\r\ntribes which shall have taken up the hatchet.\r\n\r\nI salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 6, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received last night your favor of August 29, and with\r\nit a model of a contrivance for making one gun-boat do nearly double\r\nexecution. It has all the ingenuity and simplicity which generally mark\r\nyour inventions. I am not nautical enough to judge whether two guns may\r\nbe too heavy for the bow of a gun-boat, or whether any other objection\r\nwill countervail the advantage it offers, and which I see visibly enough.\r\nI send it this day to the Secretary of the Navy, within whose department\r\nit lies to try and to judge it. Believing, myself, that gun-boats are the\r\nonly _water_ defence which can be useful to us, and protect us from the\r\nruinous folly of a navy, I am pleased with everything which promises to\r\nimprove them.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Friedland, armistice with Russia, conquest of Prussia, will\r\nbe working on the British stomach when they will receive information of\r\nthe outrage they have committed on us. Yet, having entered on the policy\r\nproposed by their champion \"war in disguise,\" of making the property of\r\nall nations lawful plunder to support a navy which their own resources\r\ncannot support, I doubt if they will readily relinquish it. That war\r\nwith us had been predetermined may be fairly inferred from the diction\r\nof Berkley's order, the Jesuitism of which proves it ministerial from\r\nits being so timed as to find us in the midst of Burr's rebellion as they\r\nexpected, from the contemporaneousness of the Indian excitements, and of\r\nthe wide and sudden spread of their maritime spoliations. I salute you\r\nwith great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY, ESQ., ATTORNEY FOR THE U. S., BEFORE THE DISTRICT OF\r\nVIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Understanding that it is thought important that a letter of November\r\n12, 1806, from General Wilkinson to myself, should be produced in evidence\r\non the charges against Burr, depending in the District Court now sitting\r\nin Richmond, I send you a copy of it, omitting only certain passages, the\r\nnature of which is explained in the certificate subjoined to the letter.\r\nAs the Attorney for the United States, be pleased to submit the copy and\r\ncertificate to the uses of the Court. I salute you with great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nP. S. On re-examination of a letter of November 12, 1806, from General\r\nWilkinson to myself, (which having been for a considerable time out of my\r\npossession, and now returned to me,) I find in it some passages entirely\r\nconfidential, given for my information in the discharge of my executive\r\nfunctions, and which my duties and the public interest forbid me to make\r\npublic. I have therefore given above a correct copy of all those parts\r\nwhich I ought to permit to be made public. Those not communicated are in\r\nnowise material for the purposes of justice on the charges of treason or\r\nmisdemeanor depending against Aaron Burr; they are on subjects irrelevant\r\nto any issues which can arise out of those charges, and could contribute\r\nnothing towards his acquittal or conviction. The papers mentioned in\r\nthe 1st and 3d paragraphs, as enclosed in the letters, being separated\r\ntherefrom, and not in my possession, I am unable, from memory, to say what\r\nthey were. I presume they are in the hands of the attorney for the United\r\nStates. Given under my hand this 7th day of September, 1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now return you Major Newton's letters. The intention of the\r\nsquadron in the bay is so manifestly pacific, that your instructions to\r\nhim are perfectly proper, not to molest their boats merely for approaching\r\nthe shore. While they are giving up slaves and citizen seamen, and\r\nattempting nothing ashore, it would not be well to stop this by any\r\nnew restriction. If they come ashore indeed, they must be captured, or\r\ndestroyed if they cannot be captured, because we mean to enforce the\r\nproclamation rigorously in preventing supplies. So the instructions\r\nalready given as to intercourse by flag, as to sealed and unsealed\r\nletters, must be strictly adhered to. It is so material that the seaport\r\ntowns should have artillery militia duly trained, that I think you have\r\ndone well to permit Captain Nestell's company to have powder and ball to\r\nexercise. With respect to gun-carriages, furnaces and clothes, I am so\r\nlittle familiar with the details of the War department that I must beg\r\nthose subjects to lie till the return of the Secretary at War, which will\r\nbe in three weeks. Proposing to be absent from this place from the 9th to\r\nthe 16th instant, our daily post will be suspended during that interval. I\r\nsalute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE HAY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 7, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received, late last night, your favor of the day before,\r\nand now re-enclose you the subpœna. As I do not believe that the district\r\ncourts have a power of _commanding_ the executive government to abandon\r\nsuperior duties and attend on them, at whatever distance, I am unwilling,\r\nby any notice of the subpœna, to set a precedent which might sanction a\r\nproceeding so preposterous. I enclose you, therefore, a letter, public and\r\nfor the court, covering substantially all they ought to desire. If the\r\npapers which were enclosed in Wilkinson's letter may, in your judgment,\r\nbe communicated without injury, you will be pleased to communicate them. I\r\nreturn you the original letter.\r\n\r\nI am happy in having the benefit of Mr. Madison's counsel on this\r\noccasion, he happening to be now with me. We are both strongly of opinion,\r\nthat the prosecution against Burr for misdemeanor should proceed at\r\nRichmond. If defeated, it will heap coals of fire on the head of the\r\nJudge; if successful, it will give time to see whether a prosecution for\r\ntreason against him can be instituted in any, and what other court. But we\r\nincline to think, it may be best to send Blennerhasset and Smith (Israel)\r\nto Kentucky, to be tried both for the treason and misdemeanor. The trial\r\nof Dayton for misdemeanor may as well go on at Richmond.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Madison, who is with me, suggests the expediency of\r\nimmediately taking up the case of Captain Porter, against whom you know\r\nMr. Erskine lodged a very serious complaint, for an act of violence\r\ncommitted on a British seaman in the Mediterranean. While Mr. Erskine\r\nwas reminded of the mass of complaints we had against his government\r\nfor similar violences, he was assured that contending against such\r\nirregularities ourselves, and requiring satisfaction for them, we did\r\nnot mean to follow the example, and that on Captain Porter's return, it\r\nshould be properly inquired into. The sooner this is done the better;\r\nbecause if Great Britain settles with us satisfactorily all our subsisting\r\ndifferences, and should require in return, (to have an appearance of\r\nreciprocity of wrong as well as redress,) a marked condemnation of\r\nCaptain Porter, it would be embarrassing were that the only obstacle\r\nto a peaceable settlement, and the more so as we cannot but disavow his\r\nact. On the contrary, if we immediately look into it, we shall be more at\r\nliberty to be moderate in the censure of it, on the very ground of British\r\nexample; and the case being once passed upon, we can more easily avoid\r\nthe passing on it a second time, as against a settled principle. It is\r\ntherefore to put it in our power to let Captain Porter off as easily as\r\npossible, as a valuable officer whom we all wish to favor, that I suggest\r\nto you the earliest attention to the inquiry, and the promptest settlement\r\nof it. I set out to-morrow on a journey of 100 miles, and shall be absent\r\neight or nine days. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his compliments to Mr. Crawford, and his\r\nthanks for his Observations on Quarantines, which he has read with great\r\npleasure. Not himself a friend to quarantines, nor having confidence\r\nin their efficacy, even if they are necessary, he sees with pleasure\r\nevery effort to lessen their credit. But the theory which derives all\r\ninfection, and ascribes to unseen animals the effects hitherto believed to\r\nbe produced by it, is as yet too new and unreceived to justify the public\r\nservants in resting thereon the public health, until time and further\r\ninvestigation shall have sanctioned it by a more general confidence. He\r\nsalutes Mr. Crawford with great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 2d is received, and I have this day directed\r\ncommissions for Bull, Hubbell, and for Benajah Nicholls of North Carolina,\r\nas Surveyor of the port of Windsor, v. Simeon Turner, resigned. This last\r\nis on the recommendation of Alston.\r\n\r\nYou know that the merchants of New York and Philadelphia were of opinion\r\nthat a public vessel sent into the Bay of Bengal to notify our trade\r\nthere, would in fact increase the danger of our vessels. The most\r\nintelligent merchants of Baltimore, consulted by Mr. Smith, were of\r\nthe same opinion as to the Straits of Sunda. It was therefore concluded\r\nbetween Mr. Smith, Mr. Madison, and myself, (time not admitting further\r\nconsultation,) that it would be best to make a Consul for Batavia,\r\n(there being none,) and send him to his post by a private vessel, with\r\ninstructions to take the best measures he could for notifying all our\r\ntrade beyond the Straits, to instruct our Consul at the Isle of France to\r\ndo the same to all on this side, and moreover to send a special agent by\r\nany private conveyance to be obtained, to go from port to port in the Bay\r\nof Bengal, to give private notice to the vessels there. As several vessels\r\nwere on their departure for those seas from Philadelphia and Baltimore,\r\nit is trusted that this arrangement will effect all the good proposed,\r\nand avoid all the evil apprehended at the different places which were\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nI set out to-morrow to Bedford, and shall be absent eight days. I shall\r\nleave this on the 30th, and be in Washington the 3d of October, ready for\r\nour meeting on the 5th. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On my return to this place yesterday I found your favor of the 15th,\r\nand now return the papers it covered. I am glad to see the temperate\r\ncomplexion of Lowrie's correspondence. I presume the intelligence\r\nfrom England since the arrival there of the information respecting the\r\nChesapeake, will produce a moderate deportment in their officers. Your\r\ninstructions to Major Newton on the opening of letters, are perfectly\r\nconsonant with the rules laid down. With respect to the mode of furnishing\r\nthe troops with provisions through any other channel than that of\r\nthe public contractor, I am unable to say anything, being not at all\r\nacquainted with the arrangements of the war department on that subject.\r\nI enclose you a letter I have received from a Mr. Belcher, of Gloster,\r\ngiving reason to believe there have been some contraventions of the\r\nProclamation there which ought to be punished if they can be detected. I\r\nsalute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nI returned here yesterday afternoon and found, as I might expect, an\r\nimmense mass of business. With the papers received from you, I enclose you\r\nsome others which will need no explanation. I am desired by the Secretary\r\nof the Navy to say what must be the conduct of Commodore Rodgers, at\r\nNew York, on the late or any similar entry of that harbor by the British\r\narmed vessels. I refer him to the orders to Decatur as to what he was to\r\ndo if the vessels in the Chesapeake. 1. Remain quiet in the Bay. 2. Come\r\nto Hampton road. 3. Enter Elizabeth river, and recommend an application\r\nof the same rules to New York, accommodated to the localities of the\r\nplace. Should the British government give us reparation of the past,\r\nand security for the future, yet the continuance of their vessels in our\r\nharbors in defiance constitutes a new injury, which will not be included\r\nin any settlement with our ministers, and will furnish good ground\r\nfor declaring their future exclusion from our waters, in addition with\r\nthe other reasonable ground before existing. Our Indian affairs in the\r\nnorthwest on the Missouri, and at the Natchitoches, wear a very unpleasant\r\naspect. As to the first all I think is done which is necessary. But for\r\nthis and other causes, I am anxious to be again assembled. I have a letter\r\nfrom Connecticut. The prosecution there will be dismissed this term on\r\nthe ground that the case is not cognisable by the courts of the United\r\nStates. Perhaps you can intimate this where it will give tranquillity.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 18, 1807\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On my return yesterday I found yours of the 10th, and now\r\nre-enclose you Commodore Rodgers' letter. You remember that the orders to\r\nDecatur were to leave the British ships unmolested so long as they laid\r\nquiet in the Bay; but if they should attempt to enter Elizabeth river\r\nto attack them with all his force. The spirit of these orders should, I\r\nthink, be applied to New York. So long as the British vessels merely enter\r\nthe Hook, or remain quiet there, I would not precipitate hostilities. I do\r\nnot sufficiently know the geography of the harbor to draw the line which\r\nthey should not pass. Perhaps the narrows, perhaps some other place which\r\nyourself or Commodore Rogers can fix with the aid of the advice he can get\r\nin New York. But a line should be drawn which if they attempt to pass, he\r\nshould attack them with all his force. Perhaps he would do well to have\r\nhis boats ordinarily a little without the line to let them see they are\r\nnot to approach it; but whether he can lay there in safety, _ordinarily_,\r\nhe must judge. But if the British vessels continue at the Hook, great\r\nattention should be paid to prevent their receiving supplies or their\r\nlanding, or having any intercourse with the shore or other vessels. I\r\nleft Mr. Nicholas's yesterday morning: he is indisposed with his annual\r\ninfluenza. Mrs. Nicholas is well. I shall be at Washington on the 3d\r\nproximo. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT BRENT, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have just received your favor of the 8th, informing me that the\r\nBoard of Trustees for the public school in Washington had unanimously\r\nre-appointed me their President. I pray you to present to them my thanks\r\nfor the mark of their confidence, with assurances that I shall at all\r\ntimes be ready to render to the Institution any services which shall be in\r\nmy power. Accept yourself my salutations, and assurances of great respect\r\nand esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                        September 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nI return all the papers received in yours of the 18th and 19th, except\r\none soliciting office, Judge Woodward's letters, to be communicated to\r\nthe Secretary of War. Should not Claiborne be instructed to say at once to\r\nGovernor Folch, that as we never did prohibit any articles (except slaves)\r\nfrom being carried up the Mississippi to Baton Rouge, so we do not mean to\r\nprohibit them, and that we only ask a perfect and equal reciprocity to be\r\nobserved on the rivers which pass through the territories of both nations.\r\nMust we not denounce to Congress the Spanish decree as well as the British\r\nregulation pretending to be the countervail of the French? One of our\r\nfirst consultations, on meeting, must be on the question whether we shall\r\nnot order all the militia and volunteers destined for the Canadas to be\r\nembodied on the 26th of October, and to march immediately to such points\r\non the way to their destination as shall be pointed out, there to await\r\nthe decision of Congress? I approve of the letter to Erskine. In answering\r\nhis last, should he not be reminded how strange it is he should consider\r\nas a hostility our refusing to receive but under a flag, persons from\r\nvessels remaining and acting in our waters in defiance of the authority\r\nof the country? The post-rider of the day before yesterday has behaved\r\nmuch amiss in not calling on you. When I found your mail in the valise and\r\nthat they had not called on you, I replaced the mail in it and expressly\r\ndirected him to return by you. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAY.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--General Wilkinson has asked permission to make use, in the\r\nstatement of Burr's affair which he is about to publish, of the documents\r\nplaced in your hands by Mr. Rodney. To this, consent is freely given with\r\none reservation. Some of these papers are expressed to be confidential.\r\nOthers containing censures on particular individuals, are such as I always\r\ndeem confidential, and therefore cannot communicate, but for regularly\r\nofficial purposes, without a breach of trust. I must therefore ask the\r\nexercise of your discretion in selecting all of this character, and of\r\ngiving to the General the free use of the others. It will be necessary\r\nthat the whole be returned to the Attorney General by the first week in\r\nthe next month, as a selection will be made from them to make part of the\r\nwhole evidence in the case, which I shall have printed and communicated to\r\nCongress. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 20, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favors of the 13th and 15th on my return to\r\nthis place on the 17th, and such was the mass of business accumulated in\r\nmy absence, that I have not till now been able to take up your letters.\r\nYou are certainly free to make use of any of the papers we put into\r\nMr. Hay's hands, with a single reservation: to wit, some of them are\r\nexpressed to be confidential, and others are of that kind which I always\r\nconsider as confidential, conveying censure on particular individuals, and\r\ntherefore never communicate them beyond the immediate executive circle. I\r\naccordingly write to this effect to Mr. Hay. The scenes which have been\r\nacted at Richmond are such as have never before been exhibited in any\r\ncountry where all regard to public character has not yet been thrown off.\r\nThey are equivalent to a proclamation of impunity to every traitorous\r\ncombination which may be formed to destroy the Union; and they preserve a\r\nhead for all such combinations as may be formed within, and a centre for\r\nall the intrigues and machinations which foreign governments may nourish\r\nto disturb us. However, they will produce an amendment to the Constitution\r\nwhich, keeping the judges independent of the Executive, will not leave\r\nthem so, of the nation.\r\n\r\nI shall leave this place on the 30th for Washington. It is with pleasure\r\nthat I perceive from all the expressions of public sentiment, that the\r\nvirulence of those whose treasons you have defeated only place you on\r\nhigher ground in the opinion of the nation. I salute you with great esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. COXE.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have read with great satisfaction your observations on the\r\nprinciples for equalizing the power of the different nations on the\r\nsea, and think them perfectly sound. Certainly it will be better to\r\nproduce a balance on that element, by reducing the means of its great\r\nmonopolizer, than by endeavoring to raise our own to an equality with\r\ntheirs. I have ever wished that all nations would adopt a navigation law\r\nagainst those who have one, which perhaps would be better than against all\r\nindiscriminately, and while in France I proposed it there. Probably that\r\ncountry is now ripe for it. I see no reason why your paper should not be\r\npublished, as it would have effect towards bringing the public mind to\r\nproper principles. I do not know whether you kept a copy; if you did not,\r\nI will return it. Otherwise I retain it for the perusal of my coadjutors,\r\nand perhaps to suggest the measure abroad. I salute you with great esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, October 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,-- * * * * * The approaching convention of Congress would render\r\nyour assistance here desirable. Besides the varieties of general matter\r\nwe have to lay before them, on which we should be glad of your aid and\r\ncounsel, there are two subjects of magnitude in which your agency will be\r\npeculiarly necessary. 1st. The selection and digestion of the documents\r\nrespecting Burr's treason, which must be laid before Congress in two\r\ncopies, (or perhaps printed, which would take ten days.) 2d. A statement\r\nof the conduct of Great Britain towards this country, so far as respects\r\nthe violations of the Maritime Law of nations. Here it would be necessary\r\nto state each distinct principle violated, and to quote the cases of\r\nviolation, and to conclude with a view of her vice-admiralty courts, their\r\nvenality and rascality, in order to show that however for conveniences,\r\n(and not of right) the court of the captor is admitted to exercise the\r\njurisdiction, yet that in so palpable an abuse of that trust, some remedy\r\nmust be applied. Everything we see and hear leads in my opinion to war;\r\nwe have therefore much to consult and determine on, preparatory to that\r\nevent. I salute you with affectionate respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, October 9, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your second letter on the subject of gun-boats, came to hand\r\njust before my departure from Monticello. In the meantime, the inquiry\r\ninto the proposition had been referred, agreeably to our usage, or to\r\nreason, to the practical persons of the department to which it belonged,\r\ndeemed most skilful. On my arrival here, I found the answers of the\r\npersons to whom it was referred, the substance of which I now enclose\r\nyou. I am not a judge of their solidity, but I presume they are founded,\r\nand the rather as they are from officers entirely favorable to the use of\r\ngun-boats.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet no knowledge of the arrival of the Revenge in England,\r\nbut we may daily expect to hear of it; and as we expected she would be\r\ndetained there and in France about a month, it will be a month hence\r\nbefore we can expect her back here. In the meantime, all the little\r\ncircumstances coming to our knowledge are unfavorable to our wishes for\r\npeace. If they would but settle the question of impressment from our\r\nbottoms, I should be well contented to drop all attempts at a treaty. The\r\nother rights of neutral powers will be taken care of by Bonaparte and\r\nAlexander; and for commercial arrangements we can sufficiently provide\r\nby legislative regulations. But as the practice of impressment has taken\r\nplace only against us, we shall be left to settle that for ourselves;\r\nand to do this we shall never again have so favorable a conjuncture of\r\ncircumstances. Accept my friendly salutations and assurances of great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 12, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now return you several of Major Newton's letters, some of\r\nwhich have been kept awhile for consideration. It is determined that\r\nthere shall be no relaxation in the conditions of the proclamations, or\r\nany change in the rules of intercourse by flag. If the British officers\r\nset the example of refusing to receive a flag, let ours then follow it\r\nby never sending or receiving another. The interval cannot now be long in\r\nwhich matters will remain at their present point. I salute you with great\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, October 14, 1807\r\n\r\nI think the proper instructions for Mr. Christie's revenue cutter may\r\nbe drawn from those given to Captain Decatur. The authority of the\r\nproclamation is to be maintained, no supplies to be permitted to be\r\ncarried to the British vessels, nor their vessels permitted to land. For\r\nthese purposes force, and to any extent, is to be applied, if necessary,\r\nbut not unless necessary, nor, considering how short a time the present\r\nstate of things has to continue, would I recommend any extraordinary\r\nvigilance or great industry in seeking even just occasions for collision.\r\nIt will suffice to do what is right when the occasion comes into their\r\nway. I cannot doubt the expediency of getting the instruments recommended\r\nby Mr. Patterson, and of the best kind, _if they can be got in England_,\r\nbecause I almost know they cannot be made _in any other country_ equally\r\ngood, and I should be quite averse to getting those which should not be\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nMay we not at once appoint the republican candidate for the collectorship\r\nof Snow-hill? Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 17, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I forwarded to Mr. Smith, Secretary of the Navy, an extract\r\nof so much of my letter to you of August 31st, as suggested the idea of\r\nartificial harbors for gun-boats, on the horse-shoe and middle grounds,\r\nwith a view to his having their formation examined, to know if they\r\nwould support works, and their distance ascertained, to know what would\r\nbe their effect. The objects were, 1, to provide an asylum on the shoals\r\nfor gun-boats against weather and ships of war, and 2, to prevent ships\r\nlying within the capes. I enclose you the opinion of Captain Porter,\r\naccording to which, without thinking of attempting works so difficult and\r\ndoubtful, both ends will be answered by a work at Lynhaven river, where\r\nthe shoals are extensive enough to keep off ships of war, and the river\r\nsufficiently capacious to receive all the gun-boats. He thinks a work at\r\nPoint Comfort might also be useful. I send you his draught, which, being\r\nmerely an enlargement from More's map on a very minute scale, is not to\r\nbe much depended on; and considering the extent of country that point is\r\nto defend, I recommend it to your consideration, as one of our important\r\nobjects. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 8th inst., covering, at\r\nthe request of the general court of Massachusetts, a memorial to the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives of the United States, on behalf of\r\nBenjamin Hichborn and others, with a desire that I would communicate and\r\nrecommend the same to both Houses of Congress. I should avail myself with\r\nparticular pleasure of every occasion of doing what would be acceptable\r\nto the legislative and executive authorities of Massachusetts, and\r\nwhich should be within the limits of my functions. The Executive of the\r\nUnion is, indeed, by the Constitution, made the channel of communication\r\nbetween _foreign_ powers and the United States. But citizens, whether\r\nindividually, or in bodies corporate, or associated, have a right to\r\napply directly to any department of their government, whether legislative,\r\nexecutive, or judiciary, the exercise of whose powers they have a right\r\nto claim; and neither of these can regularly offer its intervention in a\r\ncase belonging to the other. The communication and recommendation by me\r\nto Congress of the memorial you have been pleased to enclose me, would\r\nbe an innovation, not authorized by the practice of our government, and\r\ntherefore the less likely to add to its weight or effect. Thus restrained\r\nfrom serving you in the exact way desired, I have thought I could not\r\nbetter do it than by a prompt return of the papers, that no time might\r\nbe lost in transmitting them through the accustomary channels of your\r\nSenators and Representatives in Congress; and I avail myself of the\r\noccasion of assuring you of my very high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BARTON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received last night a diploma from the Linnæan Society of\r\nPhiladelphia, doing me the honor of associating me to their body. I pray\r\nyou to do me the favor of assuring the society of my sensibility for\r\nthis mark of their notice, and of my thanks. Sincerely associated with\r\nthe friends of science, in spirit and inclination, I regret the constant\r\noccupations of a different kind, which put out of my power the proper\r\nco-operations with them, had I otherwise the talents for them. I shall\r\ngladly embrace any occasion which can be offered of being useful to the\r\nsociety, as a mark of my acknowledgments for their favors, with my thanks\r\nfor the copy of your discourse, enclosed at the same time. I pray you\r\nto receive my friendly salutations, and assurances of great respect and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES GAMBLE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 17th has been duly received. I have long seen,\r\nand with very great regret, the schisms which have taken place among the\r\nrepublicans, and principally those of Pennsylvania and New York. As far as\r\nI have been able to judge, they have not been produced by any difference\r\nof political principle,--at least, any important difference, but by a\r\ndifference of opinion as to persons. I determined from the first moment\r\nto take no part in them, and that the government should know nothing of\r\nany such differences. Accordingly, it has never been attended to in any\r\nappointment, or refusal of appointment. General Shee's personal merit,\r\nuniversally acknowledged, was the cause of his appointment as Indian\r\nSuperintendent, and a subsequent discovery that his removal to this\r\nplace (the indispensable residence of that officer), would be peculiarly\r\nunpleasant to him suggested his translation to another office, to solve\r\nthe double difficulty. Rarely reading the controversial pieces between\r\nthe different sections of republicans, I have not seen the piece in the\r\nAurora, to which you allude; but I may with truth assure you, that no\r\nfact has come to my knowledge which has ever induced any doubt of your\r\ncontinued attachment to the true principles of republican government. I\r\nam thankful for the favorable sentiments you are so kind as to express\r\ntowards me personally, and trust that an uniform pursuit of the principles\r\nand conduct which have procured, will continue to me an approbation, which\r\nI highly value.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 25, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letters of the 21st and 22d are received, and I now return\r\nCaptain Read's of the 18th. We conclude it unnecessary to call for another\r\ncorps of militia, to relieve that now in service at Lynhaven. General\r\nDearborn will write, and give the necessary directions for discharging,\r\npaying, &c. I suspect the departure of the British armed vessels from our\r\nwaters, is in consequence of orders from their government to respect the\r\nproclamation. If Congress should approve our ideas of defensive works for\r\nthe several harbors of the United States, there will be a regular fort at\r\nthe mouth of Lynhaven river, to protect such a number of gun-boats to be\r\nstationed there as will, in case of war, render it too dangerous to any\r\narmed vessel to enter the bay; and thus to protect the bay and all its\r\nwaters at its mouth. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 27, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have reflected on the case of the embodying of the militia\r\nin Ohio, and think the respect we owe to the State may overweigh the\r\ndisapprobation so justly due to the conduct of their Governor pro tem.\r\nThey certainly had great merit, and have acquired a very general favor\r\nthrough the Union, for the early and vigorous blows by which they crushed\r\nthe insurrection of Burr. We have now again to appeal to their patriotism\r\nand public spirit in the same case; and should there be war, they are\r\nour bulwark in the most prominent point of assault from the Indians.\r\nTheir good will and affection, therefore, should be conciliated by\r\nall justifiable means. If we suffer the question of paying the militia\r\nembodied to be thrown on their Legislature, it will excite acrimonious\r\ndebate in that body, and they will spread the same dissatisfaction among\r\ntheir constituents, and finally it will be forced back on us through\r\nCongress. Would it not, therefore, be better to say to Mr. Kirker, that\r\nthe general government is fully aware that emergencies which appertain to\r\nthem will sometimes arise so suddenly as not to give time for consulting\r\nthem, before the State must get into action; that the expenses in\r\nsuch cases, incurred on reasonable grounds, will be met by the general\r\ngovernment; and that in the present case, although it appears there was\r\nno real ground for embodying the militia, and that more certain measures\r\nfor ascertaining the truth should have been taken before embodying them,\r\nyet an unwillingness to damp the public spirit of your countrymen, and\r\nthe justice due to the individuals who came forward in defence of their\r\ncountry, and who could not know the grounds on which they were called,\r\nhave determined us to consider the call as justifiable, and to defray\r\nthe expenses. This is submitted to you for consideration. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nI think there is nothing in the former regulations of the Salines which\r\nhindered merchants or others of the country round about, far or near,\r\nfrom purchasing salt at the Salines, at the stated price, and carrying\r\nand vending it elsewhere at their own price; and it was naturally to be\r\nexpected that competition would in this way reduce it to a proper price\r\nwherever sold. If this had taken place, it would have been desirable\r\nthat the lessees should not have engaged in it, because as the price at a\r\ndistance must add some profit to the transportation and first cost, this\r\nprofit might have induced the lessees to sell reluctantly on the spot. As\r\nthe merchants, however, have not entered into this business, I think it\r\nwould be well to let the lessees begin it, leaving them open to the effect\r\nof future competition; subjecting them to a maximum as they themselves\r\npropose, and to have the permission revoked if they obstruct sales at the\r\nSalines, or otherwise abuse the permission. I return you their letter.\r\n\r\nI return you, also, the papers respecting the lead mines, and think with\r\nyou that one-fifth for the three last years is not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nI propose to inform Mr. Moore (if you know of no objection,) that I\r\napprove his proposition for cutting the whole road from Cumberland to\r\nBrownsville. We shall by this means secure, at any rate, the benefit of\r\ntheir location, which will of itself have occasioned considerable expense.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 31, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe rent we proposed for the Indiana lead mine was two-tenths of\r\nthree years' produce=six-tenths of one year's produce for five years'\r\noccupation: and one-tenth of five year's produce=five-tenths of one year's\r\nproduce for five years' occupation, is the option you propose. There can\r\nbe but one objection to it, that is, the effect which a rent of one-tenth\r\nannually might have in lowering the future rents permanently. From the\r\nLouisiana standing rent of one-tenth, and the offer of one-tenth for the\r\nIndiana mine, I suspect that one-fifth may be too much for a permanent\r\nrent. What would you think of continuing the offer of two years free of\r\nrent, and one-eighth of the _metal_ afterwards? I think the most important\r\nobject for the public is to find what rent the tenant can pay and still\r\nhave an encouraging profit for himself, and to obtain that rent. However,\r\nI suggest this merely for your consideration.\r\n\r\nI have written to Mr. Moore on the subject of the road. Whom shall we\r\nappoint in the room of Kilgore. I have conversed with Morrar, but have had\r\nno opportunity of speaking with Governor Tiffin. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, November 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your late letters have been regularly referred to the Secretary\r\nat War, who has already answered their several enquiries, or will do it\r\nimmediately. I am inclined to believe that the departure of the British\r\nvessels from our waters must be in consequence of orders from England to\r\nrespect the authorities of the country. Within about a fortnight we think\r\nwe may expect answers from England which will decide whether this cloud is\r\nto issue in a storm or calm. Here we are pacifically inclined, if anything\r\ncomes which will permit us to follow our inclinations. But whether we have\r\npeace or war, I think the present Legislature will authorize a complete\r\nsystem of defensive works, on such a scale as they think they ought to\r\nadopt. The state of our finances now permits this. To defensive works by\r\nland they will probably add a considerable enlargement of the force in\r\ngun-boats. A combination of these, will, I think, enable us to defend the\r\nChesapeake at its mouth, and save the vast line of preparation which the\r\ndefence of all its interior waters would otherwise require. I salute you\r\nwith great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, November 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your letter of August 25th, in which you\r\nexpress a wish that the letters received from you may be acknowledged,\r\nin order to ascertain their safe transmission. Those received the present\r\nyear have been of March 14, May 11, and 30, June 8, July 3, August 12, and\r\n25. They have not been before acknowledged in conformity with a practice\r\nwhich the constant pressure of business has forced me to follow, of not\r\nanswering letters which do not necessarily require it. I have seen with\r\nregret, the violence of the dissensions in your quarter. We have the same\r\nin the territories of Louisiana and Michigan. It seems that the smaller\r\nthe society the bitterer the dissensions into which it breaks. Perhaps\r\nthis observation answers all the objections drawn by Mr. Adams from the\r\nsmall republics of Italy. I believe ours is to owe its permanence to its\r\ngreat extent, and the smaller portion comparatively, which can ever be\r\nconvulsed at one time by local passions. We expect shortly now to hear\r\nfrom England, and to know how the present cloud is to terminate. We\r\nare all pacifically inclined here, if anything comes from thence which\r\nwill permit us to follow our inclinations. I salute you with esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          November 8, 1807.\r\n\r\nI will sign a proclamation for the sale of the lands northwest of Ohio,\r\nwhenever you think proper. I believe the form is in your office, and in\r\nthe course of this week we will agree on the officers.\r\n\r\nI am afraid we know too little as yet of the lead mines to establish a\r\npermanent system. I verily believe that of leasing will be far the best\r\nfor the United States. But it will take time to find out what rent may be\r\nreserved, so as to enable the lessee to compete with those who work mines\r\nin their own right, and yet have an encouraging profit for themselves.\r\nHaving on the spot two such men as Lewis and Bates, in whose integrity\r\nand prudence unlimited confidence may be placed, would it not be best\r\nto confide to them the whole business of leasing and regulating the\r\nmanagement of our interests, recommending to them short leases, at first,\r\ntill themselves shall become thoroughly acquainted with the subject, and\r\nshall be able to reduce the management to a system, which the government\r\nmay then approve and adhere to. I think one article of it should be that\r\nthe rent shall be paid in metal, not in mineral, so that we may have\r\nnothing to do with works which will always be mismanaged, and reduce\r\nour concern to a simple rent. We shall lose more by ill-managed smelting\r\nworks than the digging the ore is worth. Then it would be better that our\r\nore remained in the earth than in a storehouse, and consequently we give\r\nnine-tenths of the ore for nothing. These thoughts are merely for your\r\nconsideration. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 15, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 6th has been duly received. On the subject\r\nof your location for the winter, it is impossible in my view of it,\r\nto doubt on the preference which should be given to this place. Under\r\nany circumstances it could not but be satisfactory to you to acquire\r\nan intimate knowledge of our political machine, not merely of its\r\norganization, but the individuals and characters composing it, their\r\ngeneral mode of thinking, and of acting openly and secretly. Of all this\r\nyou can learn no more at Philadelphia than of a diet of the empire. None\r\nbut an eye-witness can really understand it, and it is quite as important\r\nto be known to them, and to obtain a certain degree of their confidence in\r\nyour own right. In a government like ours, the standing of a man well with\r\nthis portion of the public must weigh against a considerable difference\r\nof other qualifications. Your quarters here may not perhaps be quite as\r\ncomfortable as at Philadelphia. There is a good house half-way between\r\nthis and the Treasury, where General Dearborne, Mr. and Mrs. Cutts, board\r\ntogether. I do not know if there is a vacancy in it, but there are houses\r\nall along the avenue, convenient to the Capitol, and to this house also,\r\nto come and take your soup with us every day, when not otherwise engaged.\r\n\r\nOur affairs with Spain laid dormant during the absence of Bonaparte from\r\nParis, because we know Spain would do nothing towards settling them, but\r\nby compulsion. Immediately on his return, our terms were stated to him,\r\nand his interposition obtained. If it was with good faith, its effect\r\nwill be instantaneous; if not with good faith, we shall discover it by\r\naffected delays, and must decide accordingly. I think a few weeks will\r\nclear up this matter. With England, all is uncertain. The late stuff by\r\nCaptain Doane, is merely a counterbalance for the stuff we had a week\r\nbefore of a contrary aspect. Those dialogues they put into the mouths\r\nof the ministers were not likely to be communicated to the newswriters,\r\nand they are founded on a falsehood within my knowledge, not that I have\r\nconfidence with an amicable arrangement with England; but I have not the\r\nless on account of this information. One circumstance only in it, I view\r\nas very possible, that she may by proclamation forbid all commerce with\r\nher enemies, which is equivalent to forbidding it with any nation but\r\nherself. As her commerce could not be accepted on such terms, this will be\r\nas much of a war as she could wage if she were to declare war, for she can\r\nwage only a maritime war with us. In such a case we could not let the war\r\nbe all on one side but must certainly endeavor at as much indemnification\r\nas we could take. If we have war with her, we shall need no loan the\r\nfirst year, a domestic loan only the second year, but after that, foreign\r\nloans. The moment the war is decided, we shall think it necessary to take\r\nmeasures to insure these by the time they are wanted, and your management\r\nof this kind of business, formerly, is known to have been so advantageous,\r\nthat we should certainly wish to avail ourselves of your services, if they\r\ncan be obtained conformably to our joint views. But nothing specific can\r\nbe said until the denouement of our present situation. No inference can\r\nbe drawn from Monroe's return, (which I dare say will be by the Revenge,)\r\nbecause his return this autumn had been earnestly solicited by him, and\r\nagreed to by us. The classification of our militia will be again proposed,\r\non a better plan, and with more probable success. With respect to General\r\nMoreau, no one entertains a more cordial esteem for his character than I\r\ndo, and although our relations with France have rendered it a duty in me\r\nnot to seek any public manifestation of it, yet were accident to bring us\r\ntogether, I could not be so much wanting to my own sentiments and those of\r\nmy constituents individually, as to omit a cordial manifestation of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES PEMBERTON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 16, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of October 31st has been duly received, and I thank\r\nyou for the communication of the report of the Committee of Friends.\r\nIt gives me great satisfaction to see that we are likely to render our\r\nIndian neighbors happier in themselves and well affected to us; that\r\nthe measures we are pursuing are prescribed equally by our duty to\r\nthem, and by the good of our own country. It is a proof the more of the\r\nindissoluble alliance between our duties and interest, which if ever\r\nthey appear to lead in opposite directions, we may be assured it is\r\nfrom our own defective views. It is evident that your society has begun\r\nat the right end for civilizing these people. Habits of industry, easy\r\nsubsistence, attachment to property, are necessary to prepare their\r\nminds for the first elements of science, and afterwards for moral and\r\nreligious instruction. To begin with the last has ever ended either in\r\neffecting nothing, or ingrafting bigotry on ignorance, and setting them to\r\ntomahawking and burning old women and others as witches, of which we have\r\nseen a commencement among them. There are two circumstances which have\r\nenabled us to advance the southern tribes faster than the northern; 1,\r\nthey are larger, and the agents and instructors therefore can extend their\r\ninstruction and influence over a much larger surface; 2, the southern\r\ntribes can raise cotton, and immediately enter on the process of spinning\r\nand weaving, so as to clothe themselves without resorting to the chase.\r\nThe northern tribes cannot cultivate cotton, nor can they supply its want\r\nby raising sheep, because of the number of wolves. I see not how they are\r\nto clothe themselves till they shall have destroyed these animals, which\r\nwill be a work of time. They should make this one of the principal objects\r\nof their hunts. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL ECCLESTON, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received on the 22d ult. your favor of May 20th, with the medals\r\naccompanying it, through the channel of my friend and ancient class-mate,\r\nMr. Manning, of Liverpool. That our own nation should entertain sentiments\r\nof gratitude and reverence for the great character who is the subject\r\nof your medallion, is a matter of duty. His disinterested and valuable\r\nservices to them have rendered it so; but such a monument to his memory by\r\nthe member of another community, proves a zeal for virtue in the abstract,\r\nhonorable to him who inscribes it, as to him whom it commemorates. In\r\nreturning you my individual thanks for the one destined for myself, I\r\nshould perform but a part of my duty were I not to add an assurance that\r\nthis testimonial in favor of the first worthy of our country will be\r\ngrateful to the feelings of our citizens generally.\r\n\r\nI immediately forwarded the two other medals and the letter to Judge\r\nWashington, with a request that he would hand one of them to Chief Justice\r\nMarshall. I salute you with great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MAURY.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 21, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of July 21st came to hand October 22d, with the\r\nletters and medals of General Washington, from Mr. Eccleston, and I now\r\ntake the liberty of enclosing through you my acknowledgments to him. This\r\ntribute of respect to the first worthy of our country, is honorable to him\r\nwho renders as to him who is the subject of it.\r\n\r\nThe world, as you justly observe, is truly in an awful state. Two nations\r\nof overgrown power are endeavoring to establish, the one an universal\r\ndominion by sea, the other by land. We naturally fear that which comes\r\ninto immediate contact with us, leaving remoter dangers to the chapter of\r\naccidents. We are now in hourly expectation of hearing from our ministers\r\nin London, by the return of the Revenge. Whether she will bring us war or\r\npeace, or the middle state of non-intercourse, seems suspended in equal\r\nbalance. With every wish for peace, permitted by the circumstances forced\r\nupon us, we look to war as equally probable. The crops of the present year\r\nhave been great beyond example. The wheat sown for the ensuing year is in\r\na great measure destroyed by the drought and the fly. A favorable winter\r\nand spring sometimes do wonders towards recovering unpromising grain; but\r\nnothing can make the next crop of wheat a good one.\r\n\r\nThe present aspect of our foreign relations has encouraged here a\r\ngeneral spirit of encouragement to domestic manufacture. The Merino\r\nbreed of sheep is well established with us, and fine samples of cloth\r\nare sent on from the north. Considerable manufactures of cotton are also\r\ncommencing. Philadelphia, particularly, is becoming more manufacturing\r\nthan commercial. I have heard nothing lately from your friends in\r\nAlbemarle; but if all had not been well with them, I should have heard of\r\nit. I tender you my affectionate salutations, and assurances of constant\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         November 22, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe defence of Orleans against a land army can never be provided for,\r\naccording to the principles of the Constitution, till we can get a\r\nsufficient militia here. I think therefore to get the enclosed bill\r\nbrought forward again. Will you be so good as to make any alterations in\r\nit which the present state of the surveys may have rendered necessary, and\r\nany others you shall think for the better?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MINOR.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 25, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 23d came to hand last night, and I thank\r\nyou for your attention to the letter to Mrs. Dangerfield, whose answer I\r\nhave received. Perceiving that you are rendered unquiet by the impudent\r\nfalsehoods with which the newspapers have tormented the public feelings\r\nlately, in a moment of extraordinary anxiety, I must assure you that these\r\narticles are all demonstrably false, that is to say, the information of\r\nabout three or four weeks ago that the ministers on both sides had given\r\nout that all things were amicably arranged. That which followed a week\r\nafter assuring us all negotiation was at an end, and war inevitable,\r\nthat is to say, Capt. Doane's news, and what followed a few days ago\r\nof Bonaparte's pretended answer to queries, extending his decree to\r\nus, coming via Antwerp and Bordeaux. It is believed that the last was\r\nfabricated in Boston, to counteract the war-news from England there\r\nafloat. I have no doubt Monroe is coming home, and that he, as well as\r\nthe Revenge, may be expected about the last of the month; and I think it\r\npossible he may be the bearer of propositions for a middle ground between\r\nus, modifying what we have deemed indispensable; consequently that there\r\nwill be time still employed in these things crossing and re-crossing the\r\nAtlantic, during which peace may take place in Europe, which of course\r\nremoves all ground of dispute between us till another war. As to the\r\nChesapeake, there is no doubt they will make satisfaction of some sort.\r\nThis is my present idea of the present state of things with that country,\r\nbut founded as you will perceive on possibilities only and conjectures,\r\nwhich one week may ascertain. I salute you with great friendship and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. FULTON.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents Mr. Fulton his thanks for the communication of\r\nhis Memoir, which he has read with great satisfaction, and now returns.\r\nThere is nothing in it but what will contribute to the promotion of its\r\ngreat object; and some of the calculations will have a very powerful\r\neffect. He salutes him with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you Mr. Law's letter, with thanks for the\r\ncommunication. I wish he may be a true prophet as to peace in six\r\nmonths. It is impossible that any other man should wish it as much as\r\nI do; although duty may control that wish. The desire of peace is very\r\nmuch strengthened in me by that which I feel in favor of the great\r\nsubjects of yours and Mr. Fulton's letters. I had fondly hoped to set\r\nthose enterprizes into motion with the last legislature I shall meet.\r\nBut the chance of war is an unfortunate check. I do not however despair\r\nthat the proposition of amendment may be sent down this session to the\r\nlegislatures. But it is not certain. There is a snail-paced gate for the\r\nadvance of new ideas on the general mind, under which we must acquiesce.\r\nA forty years' experience of popular assemblies has taught me, that you\r\nmust give them time for every step you take. If too hard pushed, they\r\nbaulk, and the machine retrogrades. I doubt whether precedence will be\r\ngiven to your part of the plan before Mr. Fulton's. People generally have\r\nmore feeling for canals and roads than education. However, I hope we can\r\nadvance them with equal pace. If the amendment is sent out this session,\r\nreturned to the next, and no war takes place, we may offer the plan to the\r\nnext session in the form of a bill, the preparation of which should be the\r\nwork of the ensuing summer. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL JOHN MASON.\r\n\r\nAlthough the decree of the French government of November 21st\r\ncomprehended, in its literal terms, the commerce of the United States,\r\nyet the prompt explanation by one of the ministers of that government\r\nthat it was not so understood, and that our treaty would be respected,\r\nthe practice which took place in the French ports conformably with that\r\nexplanation, and the recent interference of that government to procure\r\nin Spain a similar construction of a similar decree there, had given\r\nwell-founded expectation that it would not be extended to us; and this was\r\nmuch strengthened by the consideration of their obvious interests. But the\r\ninformation from our minister at Paris now communicated to Congress is,\r\nthat it is determined to extend the effect of that decree to us; and it\r\nis probable that Spain and the other Atlantic and Mediterranean States of\r\nEurope will co-operate in the same measure. The British regulations had\r\nbefore reduced us to a direct voyage to a single port of their enemies,\r\nand it is now believed they will interdict all commerce whatever with\r\nthem. A proclamation too of that government (not officially, indeed,\r\ncommunicated to us, yet so given out to the public as to become a rule of\r\naction with them,) seems to have shut the door on all negotiation with us,\r\nexcept as to the single aggression on the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nThe sum of these mutual enterprises on our national rights is that France,\r\nand her allies, reserving for further consideration the prohibiting our\r\ncarrying anything to the British territories, have virtually done it,\r\nby restraining our bringing a return cargo from them; and Great Britain,\r\nafter prohibiting a great proposition of our commerce with France and her\r\nallies, is now believed to have prohibited the whole. The whole world is\r\nthus laid under interdict by these two nations, and our vessels, their\r\ncargoes and crews, are to be taken by the one or the other, for whatever\r\nplace they may be destined, out of our own limits. If, therefore, on\r\nleaving our harbors we are certainly to lose them, is it not better, as to\r\nvessels, cargoes, and seamen, to keep them at home? This is submitted to\r\nthe wisdom of Congress, who alone are competent to provide a remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WISTAR.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have never known to what family you ascribed the Wild Sheep,\r\nor Fleecy Goat, as Governor Lewis called it, or the _Potio-trajos_, if\r\nits name must be Greek. He gave me a skin, but I know he carried a more\r\nperfect one, with the horns on, to Mr. Peale; and if I recollect well\r\nthose horns, they, with the fleece, would induce one to suspect it to be\r\nthe Lama, or at least a _Lamæ affinis_. I will thank you to inform me what\r\nyou determine it to be.\r\n\r\nI have lately received a letter from General Clarke. He has employed\r\nten laborers several weeks, at the Big-bone Lick, and has shipped the\r\nresult, in three large boxes, down the Ohio, via New Orleans, for this\r\nplace, where they are daily expected. He has sent, 1st, of the Mammoth,\r\nas he calls it, frontals, jaw-bones, tusks, teeth, ribs, a thigh, and\r\na leg, and some bones of the paw; 2d, of what he calls the Elephant, a\r\njaw-bone, tusks, teeth, ribs; 3d, of something of the Buffalo species, a\r\nhead and some other bones unknown. My intention, in having this research\r\nthoroughly made, was to procure for the society as complete a supplement\r\nto what is already possessed as that lick can furnish at this day, and\r\nto serve them first with whatever they wish to possess of it. There is a\r\ntusk and a femur which General Clarke procured particularly at my request,\r\nfor a special kind of Cabinet I have at Monticello. But the great mass of\r\nthe collection are mere duplicates of what you possess at Philadelphia,\r\nof which I would wish to make a donation to the National Institute of\r\nFrance, which I believe has scarcely any specimens of the remains of these\r\nanimals. But how to make the selection without the danger of sending away\r\nsomething which might be useful to our own society? Indeed, my friend,\r\nyou must give a week to this object. You cannot but have some wish to\r\nsee Washington for its site, and some of its edifices, which will give\r\nyou pleasure. You will see one room especially, to which Europe can show\r\nnothing superior. Baltimore, too, is an object. Take your lodgings at the\r\ntavern close by us. Mess with me every day, and in the intervals of your\r\nperlustrations of the city, Navy Yard, Capitol, &c., examine these bones,\r\nand set apart what you would wish for the society. I will give you notice\r\nwhen they arrive here, and then you will select a time when you can best\r\nabsent yourself for a week from Philadelphia. I hope you will not deny us\r\nthis great service, and I salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEN. WILLIAM CLARKE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your two favors of September 20th, and\r\nNovember 10th, and am greatly obliged, indeed, by the trouble you have\r\nbeen so good as to take in procuring for me as thorough a supplement to\r\nthe bones of the Mammoth as can now be had. I expect daily to receive your\r\nbill for all the expenses, which shall be honored with thanks.\r\n\r\nThe collection you have made is so considerable that it has suggested an\r\nidea I had not before. I see that after taking out for the Philosophical\r\nSociety everything they shall desire, there will remain such a collection\r\nof duplicates as will be a grateful offering from me to the National\r\nInstitute of France, for whom I am bound to do something. But in order to\r\nmake it more considerable, I find myself obliged to ask the addition of\r\nthose which you say you have deposited with your brother at Clarkesville,\r\nsuch as ribs, backbones, leg bones, thigh, ham hips, shoulder-blades,\r\nparts of the upper and under jaw, teeth of the Mammoth and Elephant, and\r\nparts of the Mammoth tusks, to be forwarded hereafter, if necessary.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of these last words to ask that they may packed and\r\nforwarded to me by the way of New Orleans, as the others have been. I do\r\nthis with the less hesitation, knowing these things can be of little value\r\nto yourself or brother, so much in the way of furnishing yourselves, if\r\ndesired, and because I know they will be so acceptable to an institution\r\nto which, as a member, I wish to be of some use. I salute you with great\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GEORGE ROGERS CLARKE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 19, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--As I think it probable your brother will have left you\r\nbefore the enclosed comes to hand, I have left it open, and request you to\r\nread it, and do for me what it asks of him, and what he will do should he\r\nstill be with you, that is to say to have the bones packed and forwarded\r\nfor me to William Brown, collector at New Orleans, who will send them on\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion of recalling myself to your memory, and\r\nof assuring you that time has not lessened my friendship for you. We are\r\nboth now grown old. You have been enjoying in retirement the recollections\r\nof the services you have rendered your country, and I am about to retire\r\nwithout an equal consciousness that I have not occupied places in which\r\nothers would have done more good. But in all places and times I shall wish\r\nyou every happiness, and salute you with great friendship and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 24, 1807.\r\n\r\nI think there should certainly be an inquiry into the conduct of Taylor\r\nof Ceracock, the charges being specified, of the most serious nature, and\r\noffered to be proved.\r\n\r\nWe might take a conveyance of the lands at Tarpaulin cove, of an estate,\r\nto continue _so long as a light-house should be kept upon it, and used\r\nas a light-house_. It would not be a fee simple, but what the lawyers\r\ncall a _base fee_. But it would be a bad example, and we should have all\r\nproprietors hereafter insisting on the same thing. It is better they\r\nshould trust to the liberality of the United States, in giving them a\r\npre-emption if the light-house be discontinued. It will be better to add\r\nto the absolute conveyance, such restriction of right as we consent to,\r\nto wit, that there shall be no tavern, &c., than attempt to enumerate the\r\nrights we may exercise,--_e. g._, that we may keep cows, cultivate, &c.\r\n\r\nI approve entirely the idea of conveying to the city of New Orleans the\r\nrights of the United States in the Batture, lately claimed by that city,\r\nand to all other Riparian possessors on the Mississippi all alluvions,\r\nand all atterisements, or shoals, left uncovered at low water, saving\r\nto navigators the right of landing, unloading, &c. But providing that\r\nthe claim to the Batture given to the city, should be decided by special\r\ncommissioners to whom the evidence and arguments in writing shall be sent,\r\nwithout any necessity of their going there.\r\n\r\nShould not a bill be immediately proposed for amending the embargo law? In\r\nthe meantime the revenue cutters and armed vessels must use force.\r\n\r\nCockle's bonds are certainly good set-offs against his Louisiana bills,\r\nand ought so to be used to save his sureties.\r\n\r\nI am glad to find we have 4,000,000 acres west of Chafalaya. How much\r\nbetter to have every 160 acres settled by an able-bodied militia man, than\r\nby purchasers with their hordes of negroes, to add weakness instead of\r\nstrength. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 26, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you the letters you were so kind as to communicate\r\nto me, on the appointment of Dr. Waterhouse to the care of the marine\r\nhospital. When he was decided on (November 26th), no other candidate had\r\nbeen named to me as desiring the place.\r\n\r\nThe respectable recommendations I had received, and his station as\r\nprofessor of medicine in a college of high reputation, sufficiently\r\nwarranted his abilities as a physician, and to these was added a fact\r\nwell known, that, to his zeal, the United States were indebted for the\r\nintroduction of a great blessing,--vaccination, which has extirpated one\r\nof the most loathsome and mortal diseases which has afflicted humanity\r\nsome years, probably, sooner than would otherwise have taken place. It was\r\na pleasure, therefore, as well as a duty, in dispensing the public favors,\r\nto make this small return for the great service rendered our country by\r\nDr. Waterhouse.\r\n\r\nThat he is not a professional _surgeon_ is not an objection. The marine\r\nhospitals are medical institutions, for the relief of common seamen,\r\nand the ordinary diseases to which they are liable. To them, therefore,\r\nprofessional _physicians_ have always been appointed.\r\n\r\nA surgeon is named to the navy hospital. The surgeon will have medical\r\ncases under him, and the physician some surgical cases; but not in\r\nsufficient proportion to change the characters of the institutions, or of\r\nthe persons to whom they are committed.\r\n\r\nOn a review of the subject, therefore, I have no reason to doubt that\r\nthe person appointed will perform the services of the marine hospital\r\nwith ability and faithfulness; and I feel a satisfaction in having\r\ndone something towards discharging a moral obligation of the nation, to\r\none who has saved so many of its victims from a mortal disease. Nor is\r\nit unimportant to the State in which that institution is, that it has\r\nextended his means of usefulness to the medical students of its college.\r\n\r\nI am thankful now, as at all times, for information on the subject of\r\nappointments, even when it comes too late to be used. I know none but\r\npublic motives in making them. It is more difficult and more painful than\r\nall the other duties of my office, and one in which I am sufficiently\r\nconscious that involuntary error must often be committed; and I am\r\nparticularly thankful to yourself for this opportunity of explaining\r\nthe grounds of the appointment in question; and I tender you sincere\r\nassurances of my affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 29, 1807.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to detest more than I do the fraudulent and injurious\r\npractice of covering foreign vessels and cargoes under the American flag;\r\nand I sincerely wish a systematic and severe course of punishment could be\r\nestablished. It is only as a punishment of this fraud, that we could deny\r\nto the Portuguese vessel the liberty of departing. But I do not know that\r\na solitary and accidental instance of punishment would have any effect.\r\nThe vessel is _bonâ fide_ Portuguese, the crew Portuguese, loaded with\r\nprovisions for Portugal, an unoffending and friendly country, to whom we\r\nwish no ill. I have not sufficiently considered the embargo act, to say\r\nhow far the executive is at liberty to decide on these cases. But if we\r\nare free to do it, I should be much disposed to take back her American\r\npapers, and let her go, especially on giving bond and security to land the\r\ncargo in Portugal, dangers of the sea and superior force excepted. Perhaps\r\nit would be proper to require the captain to give up also his certificate\r\nof citizenship, which is also merely fraudulent, has been the ground of\r\nfraudulent conversion, and may be used on the voyage as a fraudulent cover\r\nto the cargo. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 3, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December 20th has been received. The copy of\r\nthe late volume of Agricultural Proceedings is not yet at hand, but will\r\nprobably come safe. I had formerly received the preceding volumes from\r\nyour kindness, as you supposed. Writings on this subject are peculiarly\r\npleasing to me, for, as they tell us, we are sprung from the earth, so\r\nto that we naturally return. It is now among my most fervent longings\r\nto be on my farm, which, with a garden and fruitery, will constitute my\r\nprincipal occupation in retirement. I have lately received the proceedings\r\nof the Agricultural Society of Paris. They are proceeding with enthusiasm\r\nand understanding. I have been surprised to find that the rotation of\r\ncrops and substitution of some profitable growth preparatory for grain,\r\ninstead of the useless and expensive fallow, is yet only dawning among\r\nthem. The society has lately re-published Oliver de Serres' Theatre\r\nd'Agriculture, in 2 vols. 4to, although written in the reign of * * * * *\r\nIt is the finest body of agriculture extant, and especially as improved\r\nby voluminous notes, which bring its process to the present day. I lately\r\nreceived from Colonel Few in New York, a bottle of the oil of Beni,\r\nbelieved to be a sesamum. I did not believe there existed so perfect a\r\nsubstitute for olive oil. Like that of Florence, it has no taste, and is\r\nperhaps rather more limpid. A bushel of seed yields three gallons of oil;\r\nand Governor Milledge, of Georgia, says the plant will grow wherever the\r\nPalmi Christi will. It is worth your attention, and you can probably get\r\nseed from Colonel Few. We are in hourly expectation of Mr. Rose here, in\r\nthe hope of seeing what turn our differences with that nation are to take.\r\nAs yet all is doubtful. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 3, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Dr. Waterhouse has been appointed to the Marine Hospital of\r\nBoston, as you wished. It was a just though small return for his merit,\r\nin introducing the vaccination earlier than we should have had it. His\r\nappointment there makes some noise there and here, being unacceptable to\r\nsome; but I believe that schismatic divisions in the medical fraternity\r\nare at the bottom of it. My usage is to make the best appointment my\r\ninformation and judgment enable me to do, and then fold myself up in the\r\nmantle of conscience, and abide unmoved the peltings of the storm. And oh!\r\nfor the day when I shall be withdrawn from it; when I shall have leisure\r\nto enjoy my family, my friends, my farm and books!\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing autumn, I shall be sending on to Philadelphia a grandson of\r\nabout fifteen years of age, to whom I shall ask your friendly attentions.\r\nWithout that bright fancy which captivates, I am in hopes he possesses\r\nsound judgment and much observation; and, what I value more than all\r\nthings, good humor. For thus I estimate the qualities of the mind; 1, good\r\nhumor, 2, integrity; 3, industry; 4, science. The preference of the first\r\nto the second quality may not at first be acquiesced in; but certainly we\r\nhad all rather associate with a good-humored, light-principled man, than\r\nwith an ill tempered rigorist in morality.\r\n\r\nWe are here in hourly expectation of seeing Mr. Rose, and of knowing\r\nwhat turn his mission is to give to our present differences. The embargo\r\nis salutary. It postpones war, gives time and the benefits of events\r\nwhich that may produce; particularly that of peace in Europe, which will\r\npostpone the causes of difference to the next war. I salute you with great\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your ingenious friend, Mr. Martin, formerly made for me a drill\r\nof very fine construction. I am now very desirous of sending one of them\r\nto the Agricultural Society of Paris, with whom I am in correspondence,\r\nand who are sending me a plough supposed to be of the best construction\r\never known. On trial with their best ploughs, by a dynamometer, it is\r\ndrawn by from one-half to two-thirds of the force requisite to their best\r\nformer ploughs. Will you be so good as to get Mr. Martin to make me one\r\nof his best drills, sparing no pains to make the workmanship worthy of the\r\nobject, to pack it in a box, and contrive it for me to Fredericksburg. The\r\ncost shall be remitted him as soon as known. I see by the agricultural\r\ntransactions of the Paris Society, they are cultivating the Jerusalem\r\nartichoke for feeding their animals. They make 10,000 lb. to the acre,\r\nwhich they say is three times as much as they generally make of the\r\npotatoe. The African Negroes brought over to Georgia a seed which they\r\ncalled benn, and the botanists sesamum. I lately received a bottle of the\r\noil, which was eaten with sallad by various companies. All agree it is\r\nequal to the olive oil. A bushel of seed yields three gallons of oil. I\r\npropose to cultivate it for my own use at least. The embargo keeping at\r\nhome our vessels, cargoes and seamen, saves us the necessity of making\r\ntheir capture the cause of immediate war; for, if going to England, France\r\nhad determined to take them, if to any other place, England was to take\r\nthem. Till they return to some sense of moral duty, therefore, we keep\r\nwithin ourselves. This gives time. Time may produce peace in Europe; peace\r\nin Europe removes all causes of difference, till another European war; and\r\nby that time our debt may be paid, our revenues clear, and our strength\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                           January 7, 1808.\r\n\r\nI think with you that the establishment of posts of delivery at Green Bay\r\nand Chicago, would only furnish pretexts for not entering at Mackinac;\r\nand that a new post at the falls of St. Mary's, requiring a military post\r\nto be established there, would not quit cost, nor is this a time to be\r\nmultiplying small establishments.\r\n\r\nThe collector should have his eye on the schooner Friends on her return,\r\nand though proof may be difficult, harass them with a prosecution.\r\n\r\nI see nothing in the case of the Swedish captain which can produce doubt.\r\nThe law is plain that a foreign vessel may go with the load she had on\r\nboard and no more. The exception as to vessels under the President's\r\ndirection, can only be meant to embrace governmental cases, such as advice\r\nvessels, such as permitting foreign seamen to be shipped to their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Four Brothers, I know not what can be done, unless the\r\namendatory law would authorize the collector to detain on circumstances\r\nof strong suspicion, until he can refer the case here, and give a power to\r\ndetain finally on such grounds.\r\n\r\nHave you thought of the Indian drawback? The Indians can be kept in order\r\nonly by commerce or war. The former is the cheapest. Unless we can induce\r\nindividuals to employ their capital in that trade, it will require an\r\nenormous sum of capital from the public treasury, and it will be badly\r\nmanaged. A drawback for four or five years is the cheapest way of getting\r\nthat business off our hands. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                           January 7, 1808.\r\n\r\nProceeding as we are to an extensive construction of gun-boats, there are\r\nmany circumstances to be considered and agreed on, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. How many shall we build? for the debate lately published proves clearly\r\nit was not expected we should build the whole number proposed.\r\n\r\n2. Of what size, and how many of each size?\r\n\r\n3. What weight of metal shall each size carry? shall carronades be added?\r\n\r\n4. Is it not best, as they will not be seasoned, to leave them unsealed\r\nawhile?\r\n\r\n5. Where shall they be built, and when required to be in readiness?\r\n\r\n6. As a small proportion only will be kept afloat, in time of peace, the\r\n_safe_ and _convenient_ depositories for those laid up should be inquired\r\ninto and agreed on, and sheds erected under which they may be covered from\r\nthe sun and rain.\r\n\r\n7. To economize the navy funds of the ensuing year, we should determine\r\nhow many of the boats now in service ought to be kept in each, and for how\r\nmany we will depend on the seaport in case of attack.\r\n\r\nThe first of these subjects may require a general consultation, and\r\nperhaps the 7th also. The others are matters of detail which may be\r\ndetermined on between you and myself. I shall be ready to consult with you\r\non them at your convenience. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 8, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of December 29th brings to my mind a subject which\r\nnever has presented itself but with great pain, that of your withdrawing\r\nfrom the administration, before I withdraw myself. It would have been\r\nto me the greatest of consolations to have gone through my term with the\r\nsame coadjutors, and to have shared with them the merit, or demerit, of\r\nwhatever good or evil we may have done. The integrity, attention, skill,\r\nand economy with which you have conducted your department, have given\r\nme the most complete and unqualified satisfaction, and this testimony I\r\nbear to it with all the sincerity of truth and friendship; and should a\r\nwar come on, there is no person in the United States to whose management\r\nand care I could commit it with equal confidence. That you as well\r\nas myself, and all our brethren, have maligners, who from ill-temper,\r\nor disappointment, seek opportunities of venting their angry passions\r\nagainst us, is well known, and too well understood by our constituents\r\nto be regarded. No man who can succeed you will have fewer, nor will any\r\none enjoy a more extensive confidence through the nation. Finding that\r\nI could not retain you to the end of my term, I had wished to protract\r\nyour stay, till I could with propriety devolve on another the naming of\r\nyour successor. But this probably could not be done till about the time\r\nof our separation in July. Your continuance however, till after the end\r\nof the session, will relieve me from the necessity of any nomination\r\nduring the session, and will leave me only a chasm of two or three months\r\nover which I must hobble as well as I can. My greatest difficulty will\r\narise from the carrying on the system of defensive works we propose to\r\nerect. That these should have been fairly under way, and in a course\r\nof execution, under your direction, would have peculiarly relieved\r\nme; because we concur so exactly in the scale on which they are to be\r\nexecuted. Unacquainted with the details myself, I fear that when you are\r\ngone, aided only by your chief clerk, I shall be assailed with schemes\r\nof improvement and alterations which I shall be embarrassed to pronounce\r\non, or withstand, and incur augmentations of expense, which I shall not\r\nknow how to control. I speak of the interval between the close of this\r\nsession, when you propose to retire, and the commencement of our usual\r\nrecess in July. Because during that recess, we are in the habit of leaving\r\nthings to the chief clerks; and, by the end of it, my successor may be\r\npretty well known, and prevailed on to name yours. However, I am so much\r\nrelieved by your ekeing out your continuance to the end of the session,\r\nthat I feel myself bound to consult your inclinations then, and to take\r\non myself the difficulties of the short period then ensuing. In public or\r\nin private, and in all situations, I shall retain for you the most cordial\r\nesteem, and satisfactory recollections of the harmony and friendship with\r\nwhich we have run our race together; and I pray you now to accept sincere\r\nassurances of it, and of my great respect and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. MAESE, LEYBERT AND DICKERSON, OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I duly received your favor of the 1st instant, informing me\r\nthat at an election of officers of the American Philosophical Society,\r\nheld at their hall on that day, they were pleased unanimously to elect me\r\nas their President for the ensuing year. I repeat, with great sensibility,\r\nmy thanks to the Society for these continued proofs of their good will,\r\nand my constant regret that distance and other duties deny me the pleasure\r\nof performing at their meetings the functions assigned to me, and of\r\nenjoying an intercourse with them which of all others would be the most\r\ngratifying to me. Thus circumstanced I can only renew assurances of my\r\ndevotion to the objects of the Institution, and that I shall avail myself\r\nwith peculiar pleasure of every occasion which may occur of promoting\r\nthem, and of being useful to the Society.\r\n\r\nI beg leave through you, Gentlemen, to present them the homage of my\r\ndutiful respects, and that you will accept yourselves, the assurances of\r\nmy high consideration and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nI find Bastrop's case less difficult than I had expected. My view of it is\r\nthis: The Governor of Louisiana being desirous of introducing the culture\r\nof wheat into that province, engages Bastrop as an agent for carrying\r\nthat object into effect. He agrees to lay off twelve leagues square on\r\nthe Washita and Bayou liard, as a settlement for the culture of wheat, to\r\nwhich Bastrop is to bring five hundred families, each of which families is\r\nto have four hundred arpens of the land; the residue of the twelve leagues\r\nsquare, we may understand, was to be Bastrop's premium. The government was\r\nto bear the expenses of bringing these emigrants from New Madrid, and was\r\nto allow them rations for six months,--Bastrop undertaking to provide the\r\nrations, and the government paying a real and a half for each.\r\n\r\nBastrop binds himself to settle the five hundred families in three years,\r\nand the Governor especially declares that if within that time the major\r\npart of the establishment shall not have been made good, the _twelve\r\nleagues square_, destined for Bastrop's settlers, shall be occupied by\r\nthe families first presenting themselves for that purpose. Bastrop brings\r\non some settlers,--how many does not appear, and the Intendant, from a\r\nwant of funds, suspends further proceeding in the settlement until the\r\nKing's decision. [His decision of what? Doubtless whether the settlement\r\nshall proceed on these terms, and the funds be furnished by the king?\r\nor shall be abandoned?] He promises Bastrop, at the same time, that the\r\nformer limitation of three years shall be extended to two years, after the\r\ncourse of the contract shall have again commenced to be executed, and the\r\ndetermination of the King shall be made known to Bastrop. Here, then, is\r\na complete suspension of the undertaking until the King's decision, and\r\nhis silence from that time till, and when, he ceded the province, must be\r\nconsidered as an abandonment of the project.\r\n\r\nThere are several circumstances in this case offering ground for question,\r\nwhether Bastrop is entitled to any surplus of the lands. But this will\r\nbe an investigation for the Attorney General. But the uttermost he can\r\nclaim is a surplus proportioned to the number of families he settled,\r\nthat is to say, a quota of land bearing such a proportion to the number\r\nof families he settled, (deducting four hundred arpens for each of them,)\r\nas one hundred and forty-four square leagues bear to the whole number of\r\nfive hundred families. The important fact therefore to be settled, is the\r\nnumber of families he established there before the suspension.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis du Maison Rouge (under whom Mr. Clarke claims) was to have\r\nthirty square leagues on the Washita, for settling thirty families, none\r\nof them to be Americans. The lands were located and appropriated under the\r\nterms and conditions stipulated and contracted for by the said Marquis.\r\nWhat these were we are not told. The grantee must prove his grant by\r\nproducing it. That will prove what the conditions were, and then he must\r\nprove these conditions performed.\r\n\r\nLivingston's argument does not establish the fact that the lands between\r\nthe staked line and the river, (if they belonged to the Jesuits,) were\r\nconveyed to Gravier.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to consider the indulgence to the Apelousas as anything\r\nmore than a _voluntary_ permission from the government to use the timber\r\non the ungranted lands, until they should be granted to others. It could\r\nnever be intended to keep that country forever unsettled, as appears by\r\nexpressly reserving the right of soil. But I think we should continue the\r\npermission until we sell the lands.\r\n\r\nThese opinions are, of course, not to be considered as decisions, (for\r\nthat is not my province,) but as general ideas of the rights of the United\r\nStates, to be kept in view on the settlement.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of the lots in New Orleans must certainly be suspended,\r\nuntil we get the supplementary information promised. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM WIRT, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I pray you that this letter may be sacredly secret, because it\r\nmeddles in a line wherein I should myself think it wrong to intermeddle,\r\nwere it not that it looks to a period when I shall be out of office,\r\nbut others might think it wrong notwithstanding that circumstance. I\r\nsuspected, from your desire to go into the army, that you disliked your\r\nprofession, notwithstanding that your prospects in it were inferior to\r\nnone in the State. Still I know that no profession is open to stronger\r\nantipathies than that of the law. The object of this letter, then, is\r\nto propose to you to come into Congress. That is the great commanding\r\ntheatre of this nation, and the threshold to whatever department of office\r\na man is qualified to enter. With your reputation, talents, and correct\r\nviews, used with the necessary prudence, you will at once be placed at\r\nthe head of the republican body in the House of Representatives; and\r\nafter obtaining the standing which a little time will ensure you, you may\r\nlook, at your own will, into the military, the judiciary, diplomatic, or\r\nother civil departments, with a certainty of being in either whatever you\r\nplease. And in the present state of what may be called the eminent talents\r\nof our country, you may be assured of being engaged through life in the\r\nmost honorable employments. If you come in at the next election, you will\r\nbegin your course with a new administration. That administration will\r\nbe opposed by a faction, small in numbers, but governed by no principle\r\nbut the most envenomed malignity. They will endeavor to batter down\r\nthe executive before it will have time, by its purity and correctness,\r\nto build up a confidence with the people, founded on experiment. By\r\nsupporting them you will lay for yourself a broad foundation in the public\r\nconfidence, and indeed you will become the Colossus of the republican\r\ngovernment of your country. I will not say that public life is the line\r\nfor making a fortune. But it furnishes a decent and honorable support, and\r\nplaces one's children on good grounds for public favor. The family of a\r\nbeloved father will stand with the public on the most favorable ground of\r\ncompetition. Had General Washington left children, what would have been\r\ndenied to them?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to apologize for the frankness of this communication. It\r\nproceeds from an ardent zeal to see this government (the idol of my soul)\r\ncontinue in good hands, and from a sincere desire to see you whatever you\r\nwish to be. To this apology I shall only add my friendly salutations, and\r\nassurances of sincere esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 14, 1808.\r\n\r\nI return you Chauncey's letter. I am sorry to see the seamen working for\r\nrations only, and that we cannot allow even them. And further, indeed,\r\nthat we shall be under the necessity of discharging a number of those we\r\nhave. This is so serious a question that I propose to call a consultation\r\non it a day or two hence. Our sixty-four gun-boats and ketches may\r\ncertainly be reduced to ten seamen each, at least I have at various times\r\nhad the opinions of nearly all our naval captains, that from eight to ten\r\nmen are sufficient to keep a gun-boat clean and in order, to navigate her\r\nin harbor, and to look out of it. This would give us a reduction of about\r\nfour hundred men. But even this will not bring it within the estimate.\r\nHowever, what is to be done, is the question on which I shall propose\r\na consultation. I send you a letter of a Mr. Walton, of Baltimore, for\r\nperusal, merely as it suggests ideas worth looking at. I confess, I think\r\nour _naval militia_ plan, both as to name and structure, better for us\r\nthan the English plan of seafencibles.\r\n\r\nI ought to be in possession of a former letter from the same person, but\r\nnot finding it among my papers, am induced to ask whether I sent it to\r\nyou? Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nTo the letter from Mr. Davy, of the committee of the chamber of commerce,\r\nof Philadelphia, (which I now return you,) I think you may say in answer,\r\nthat you had communicated it to the President, and were authorized to\r\nsay that the Government of the United States have no present views of\r\nforming new harbors for the reception of their vessels of war: that under\r\nthe authority, and with the means, lately given by the Legislature to\r\nthe executive, it is intended to furnish means of defence, by land and\r\nwater, to the several harbors of the United States, in proportion to their\r\nimportance and local circumstances: that all the points to be defended are\r\nnot yet definitively decided on; but that in reviewing them, the harbor\r\nproposed by the chamber of commerce, to be formed near Lewistown, will\r\nbe considered, and will have a just participation in the provisions for\r\nprotection, in the first place according to its present circumstances, and\r\nhereafter according to any new importance which shall have been given it\r\nby being made a place of greater resort for merchant vessels. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. J. DORSEY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 21, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of December 20th,\r\nand am much pleased to find our progress in manufactures to be so great.\r\nThat of cotton is peculiarly interesting, because we raise the raw\r\nmaterial in such abundance, and because it may, to a great degree, supply\r\nour deficiencies both in wool and linen. A former application on behalf\r\nof Messrs. Binney & Robertson, was delivered to the Secretary of State,\r\nwho will engage General Armstrong to aid such measures as they may take in\r\nParis for obtaining permission to draw supplies of Antimony from thence.\r\n\r\nIt will give me real pleasure to see some good system of measures and\r\nweights introduced and combined with the decimal arithmetic. It is a great\r\nand difficult question whether to venture only on a half reformation,\r\nwhich by presenting fewer innovations, may be more easily adopted, or,\r\nas the French have tried with success, make a radical reform. Your plan\r\npresents as few innovations as any I have seen; but I think your _foot_\r\nshould refer to the pendulum, by saying, for instance, that the _foot_\r\nshall be a measure which shall be to the second pendulum as 1 to 3,267;\r\nor rather as 1 to the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in latitude\r\n45°. This offers a standard in every place, because it can everywhere be\r\nfound. The rod you propose is only to be found in Philadelphia. You say\r\nin your letter that \"if the decimal mode obtain in the division of the\r\npound, the Troy and it, as regards the Troy grain, would be the same.\"\r\nI do not understand this; because the Avoirdupois pound containing 7,000\r\nTroy grains, I do not see how any decimal subdivision of the pound could\r\ncoincide with the Troy grain. However, I shall be very glad to see adopted\r\nwhatever measure is most promising. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REV. MR. MILLAR.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 18th, and am thankful to you\r\nfor having written it, because it is more agreeable to prevent than to\r\nrefuse what I do not think myself authorized to comply with. I consider\r\nthe government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution\r\nfrom intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines,\r\ndiscipline, or exercises. This results not only from the provision that\r\nno law shall be made respecting the establishment or free exercise of\r\nreligion, but from that also which reserves to the States the powers\r\nnot delegated to the United States. Certainly, no power to prescribe\r\nany religious exercise, or to assume authority in religious discipline,\r\nhas been delegated to the General Government. It must then rest with\r\nthe States, as far as it can be in any human authority. But it is only\r\nproposed that I should _recommend_, not prescribe a day of fasting and\r\nprayer. That is, that I should _indirectly_ assume to the United States an\r\nauthority over religious exercises, which the Constitution has directly\r\nprecluded them from. It must be meant, too, that this recommendation is\r\nto carry some authority, and to be sanctioned by some penalty on those\r\nwho disregard it; not indeed of fine and imprisonment, but of some degree\r\nof proscription, perhaps in public opinion. And does the change in the\r\nnature of the penalty make the recommendation less a _law_ of conduct\r\nfor those to whom it is directed? I do not believe it is for the interest\r\nof religion to invite the civil magistrate to direct its exercises, its\r\ndiscipline, or its doctrines; nor of the religious societies, that the\r\nGeneral Government should be invested with the power of effecting any\r\nuniformity of time or matter among them. Fasting and prayer are religious\r\nexercises; the enjoining them an act of discipline. Every religious\r\nsociety has a right to determine for itself the times for these exercises,\r\nand the objects proper for them, according to their own particular tenets;\r\nand this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the\r\nConstitution has deposited it.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the practice of my predecessors may be quoted. But I have\r\never believed, that the example of State executives led to the assumption\r\nof that authority by the General Government, without due examination,\r\nwhich would have discovered that what might be a right in a State\r\ngovernment, was a violation of that right when assumed by another. Be this\r\nas it may, every one must act according to the dictates of his own reason,\r\nand mine tells me that civil powers alone have been given to the President\r\nof the United States, and no authority to direct the religious exercises\r\nof his constituents.\r\n\r\nI again express my satisfaction that you have been so good as to give me\r\nan opportunity of explaining myself in a private letter, in which I could\r\ngive my reasons more in detail than might have been done in a public\r\nanswer; and I pray you to accept the assurances of my high esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson returns thanks to Mr. Barlow for the copy of the\r\nColumbiad he has been so kind as to send him; the eye discovers at\r\nonce the excellence of the mechanical execution of the work, and he is\r\npersuaded that the mental part will be found to have merited it. He will\r\nnot do it the injustice of giving it such a reading as his situation here\r\nwould admit, of a few minutes at a time, and at intervals of many days.\r\nHe will reserve it for that retirement after which he is panting, and not\r\nnow very distant, where he may enjoy it in full concert with its kindred\r\nscenes, amidst those rural delights which join in chorus with the poet,\r\nand give to his song all its magic effect. He salutes Mr. Barlow with\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR TOMKINS.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 26, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of enclosing to you the copy of an application\r\nwhich I have received from a portion of the citizens of the State of New\r\nYork, residing on the river St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario, setting forth\r\ntheir very defenceless situation for the want of arms, and praying to be\r\nfurnished from the magazines of the United States. Similar applications\r\nfrom other parts of our frontier in every direction have sufficiently\r\nshown that did the laws permit such a disposition of the arms of the\r\nUnited States, their magazines would be completely exhausted, and nothing\r\nwould remain for actual war. But it is only when troops take the field,\r\nthat the arms of the United States can be delivered to them. For the\r\nordinary safety of the citizens of the several States, whether against\r\ndangers within or without, their reliance must be on the means to be\r\nprovided by their respective States. Under these circumstances I have\r\nthought it my duty to transmit to you the representation received, not\r\ndoubting that you will have done for the safety of our fellow citizens,\r\non a part of our frontier so interesting and so much exposed, what their\r\nsituation requires, and the means under your control may permit.\r\n\r\nShould our present differences be amicably settled, it will be a question\r\nfor consideration whether we should not establish a strong post on the St.\r\nLawrence, as near our northern boundary as a good position can be found.\r\nTo do this at present would only produce a greater accumulation of hostile\r\nforce in that quarter. I pray you to accept the assurances of my high\r\nrespect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JACOB J. BROWN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The representation of the county of Jefferson, in New York, of\r\nwhich you are chairman, stating their want of arms, and asking a supply,\r\nhas been duly received and considered. I learn with great concern that\r\na portion of our frontier so interesting, so important, and so exposed,\r\nshould be so entirely unprovided with common fire-arms. I did not suppose\r\nany part of the United States so destitute of what is considered as among\r\nthe first necessaries of a farm-house. This circumstance gives me the\r\nmore concern as the laws of the United States do not permit their arms to\r\nbe delivered from the magazines but to troops actually taking the field;\r\nand, indeed, were the inhabitants on the whole of our frontier, of so\r\nmany thousands of miles, to be furnished from our magazines, little would\r\nbe left in them for actual war. For the ordinary safety of the citizens\r\nof the several States, whether against dangers from within or without,\r\nreliance has been placed either on the domestic means of the individuals,\r\nor on those provided by the respective States. What those means are in\r\nthe State of New York, I am not informed; but I have transmitted your\r\nrepresentation to Governor Tomkins, with an earnest recommendation of it\r\nto his attention; and I have no doubt that his solicitude for the welfare\r\nand safety of a portion so eminently exposed of those under his immediate\r\ncare, will ensure to you whatever his authority and his means will permit.\r\n\r\nThat an attack should be made on you by your neighbors, while the state\r\nof peace continues, cannot be supposed; nor is it certain that that\r\ncondition of things will be interrupted. Should, however, war take place,\r\nif first declared by us, your safety will of course have been previously\r\nprovided for: if by the other party, it cannot be before the measures\r\nnow in preparation will be in readiness to secure you. Should our present\r\ndifferences be amicably settled, a new post on the St. Lawrence, as near\r\nour northern boundary as a good position can be found, will be worthy of\r\nconsideration. At present it would only produce a greater accumulation of\r\nhostile force in your neighborhood, and if we should have war, it would\r\nsoon become unimportant.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, while I am in hopes that your State will provide by the\r\nloan of arms, for your immediate safety and confidence, you may be assured\r\nthat such measures shall be in readiness, and in reach, on the part of the\r\nGeneral Government, as aided by your own efforts, will effectually secure\r\nyou from the dangers you apprehend.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude without expressing to you the satisfaction with which I\r\nhave received the patriotic assurance of your best services, should they\r\nbe needed in your country's cause. They are worthy of the citizens of a\r\nfree country, who know and properly estimate the value of self-government,\r\nand are the more acceptable as from a quarter where they will be most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to assure yourself, and through you the committee, of my great\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JACOB BROWN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The substance of the enclosed letter, so far as is necessary for the\r\nsatisfaction of our fellow citizens, should be communicated to them. But\r\nthe letter itself should not be published, nor be permitted to be copied.\r\nBecause the source from which it comes will occasion every word of it to\r\nbe weighed by your neighbors on the opposite shore, and every inference to\r\nbe drawn of which it is susceptible. To aid their information as to our\r\nviews, would give them an advantage to our own prejudice. I salute you\r\nwith respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. TIFFIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson returns the enclosed to Mr. Tiffin with his thanks for\r\nthe communication. He cannot foresee what shape Burr's machinations will\r\ntake next. If we have war with Spain, he will become a Spanish General.\r\nIf with England, he will go to Canada and be employed there. Internal\r\nconvulsion may be attempted if no game more hopeful offers. But it will be\r\na difficult one, and the more so as having once failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM M'INTOSH.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received some days ago your letter of December 15th, covering\r\na copy of the resolutions of the French inhabitants of Vincennes of\r\nSeptember 18th, in answer to the address of Governor Harrison, who had,\r\nin the month of October, forwarded me a copy of the same. In his letter\r\nenclosing it he assured me that his address to them on the subject of\r\nour differences with England was merely monitory, putting them on their\r\nguard against insinuations from any agents of that country, who might\r\nfind their way among them, and containing no expression, which if truly\r\nexplained to them, should have conveyed the least doubt of his confidence\r\nin their fidelity to the United States. I had hoped therefore that the\r\nuneasiness expressed in their resolutions had been done away by subsequent\r\nexplanations, as I have no reason to believe any such distrust existed\r\nin the Governor's mind. I can assure them that he never expressed such\r\na sentiment in any of his communications to me, but that whenever he has\r\nhad occasion to speak of them, it has been in terms of entire approbation\r\nand attachment. In my own mind certainly no doubts of their fidelity have\r\never been excited or existed. Having been the Governor of Virginia when\r\nVincennes and the other French settlements of that quarter surrendered to\r\nthe arms of that State, twenty-eight years ago, I have had a particular\r\nknowledge of their character as long perhaps as any person in the United\r\nStates, and in the various relations in which I have been placed with\r\nthem by the several offices I have since held, that knowledge has been\r\nkept up. And to their great honor I can say that I have ever considered\r\nthem as sober, honest, and orderly citizens, submissive to the laws,\r\nand faithful to the nation of which they are a part. And should occasion\r\narise of proving their fidelity in the cause of their country, I count\r\non their aid with as perfect assurance as on that of any other part of\r\nthe United States. In return for this confidence, and as an additional\r\nproof on their part that it is not misplaced, I ask of them a return to\r\na perfect good understanding with their Governor, and to that respect for\r\nthose in authority over them, which has hitherto so honorably marked their\r\ncharacter. As to myself they may be assured that my confidence in them is\r\nundiminished, and that nothing will be wanting on the part of the general\r\ngovernment to secure them in the full participation of all the rights\r\ncivil and religious which are enjoyed by their fellow citizens in the\r\nUnion at large.\r\n\r\nI beg leave through you to salute them, as well as yourself, with\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HARRISON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 31, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I duly received your letter of October 10th, covering the\r\nresolutions of the French inhabitants of Vincennes, and had hoped that\r\ntheir uneasiness under your supposed want of confidence in them had\r\nsubsided. But a letter lately received from their chairman, covering\r\nanother copy of the same resolutions, induces me to answer them, in order\r\nto quiet all further uneasiness. I enclose you my answer, open for your\r\nperusal, and will thank you to seal and deliver it. I have expressed to\r\nthem the opinion I have long entertained of the ancient Canadian French,\r\non a long course of information, and as it is favorable to them, I trust\r\nit will be soothing, and restore those good dispositions which will ease\r\nthe execution of your duties, and tend to produce that union which the\r\npresent crisis calls for.\r\n\r\nRussia and Portugal have cut off all intercourse with England; their\r\nambassadors re-called, and war follows of course. Our difficulties with\r\nher are great, nor can it yet be seen how they will terminate.\r\n\r\nAccept my salutations, and assurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          February 8, 1808.\r\n\r\nIn questions like the present, important neither in principle nor amount,\r\nI think the collectors should decide for themselves, and especially as\r\nthey, and they only, are the legally competent judges; for I believe the\r\nlaw makes them the judges of the security. If the indulgence proposed\r\nbe within the intentions of the law, they can grant it; if it be not, we\r\ncannot. But it is the practice in all cases for the officer who is charged\r\nwith the taking security, to be indulgent in a hard case, as where the\r\nperson is a stranger, could he not take hypothecations of their vessels?\r\nalthough the law may not specially authorize this, yet the collector\r\ncan take it as counter security for himself, and he can assign it to the\r\ngovernment. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         February 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be very desirable that our citizens should be able\r\nto draw home their property from beyond sea, and it is possible that\r\nMr. Parish's proposition might be instrumental to that. But it would be\r\ntoo bold an extension of the views of the Legislature in the portion\r\nof discretion they have given us. They could not mean to give us so\r\nextensive a power of dispensation as would result from the duty of giving\r\nspecial licenses to merchants, and such a power, guided by no Legislative\r\nregulations, would be liable to great abuse, and greater complaints of it.\r\nI see therefore, neither justification nor safety in leaving the ground we\r\nhave taken, of confining the discretionary power given us to the public\r\ncorrespondence and public interests. If the drawing this mass of specie\r\nhere could be any way connected with any direct public operation, the\r\ndanger of the precedent would be guarded against; but as it is presented\r\nto us, I think it inadmissible. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                         February 14, 1808.\r\n\r\nI believe we must employ some of our gun-boats to aid in the execution\r\nof the embargo law. Some British ships in the Delaware, one of them\r\nloaded with fifteen hundred barrels of flour for Jamaica, another armed\r\nas a letter of marque, openly mean to go out by force. The last is too\r\nstrong for the revenue cutters. Mr. Brice also, of Baltimore, asks armed\r\nassistance. I see nothing at present to prevent our sparing a couple of\r\ngun-boats from New York to go into the Delaware, and a couple from Norfolk\r\nto come up to the head of the Bay. Will this interfere with more important\r\nduties? Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         February 14, 1808.\r\n\r\nI have written to Mr. Smith, proposing to order a couple of gun-boats from\r\nNew York into the Delaware, and two from Norfolk to the head of the bay. I\r\nhope the passage of naval stores into Canada will be prevented. I enclose\r\nfor your information the account of a silver mine to fill your treasury.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DANIEL SALMON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your letter of the 8th instant, on the subject\r\nof the stone in your possession, supposed meteoric. Its descent from the\r\natmosphere presents so much difficulty as to require careful examination.\r\nBut I do not know that the most effectual examination could be made by\r\nthe members of the National Legislature, to whom you have thought of\r\nexhibiting it. Some fragments of these stones have been already handed\r\nabout among them. But those most highly qualified for acting in _their_\r\nstations, are not necessarily supposed most familiar with subjects of\r\nnatural history; and such of them as have that familiarity, are not in\r\nsituations here to make the investigation. I should think that an inquiry\r\nby some one of our scientific societies, as the Philosophical Society\r\nof Philadelphia for example, would be most likely to be directed with\r\nsuch caution and knowledge of the subject, as would inspire a general\r\nconfidence. We certainly are not to deny whatever we cannot account for.\r\nA thousand phenomena present themselves daily which we cannot explain,\r\nbut where facts are suggested, bearing no analogy with the laws of\r\nnature as yet known to us, their verity needs proofs proportioned to\r\ntheir difficulty. A cautious mind will weigh well the opposition of the\r\nphenomenon to everything hitherto observed, the strength of the testimony\r\nby which it is supported, and the errors and misconceptions to which even\r\nour senses are liable. It may be very difficult to explain how the stone\r\nyou possess came into the position in which it was found. But is it easier\r\nto explain how it got into the clouds from whence it is supposed to have\r\nfallen? The actual fact however is the thing to be established, and this I\r\nhope will be done by those whose situations and qualifications enable them\r\nto do it. I salute you with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ANTHONY G. BETTAY.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your letter of January 27th. With respect to\r\nthe silver mine on the river Platte, 1,700 miles from St. Louis, I will\r\nobserve that in the present state of things between us and Spain, we could\r\nnot propose to make an establishment at that distance from all support.\r\nIt is interesting however that the knowledge of its position should be\r\npreserved, which can be done either by confiding it to the government,\r\nwho will certainly never make use of it without an honorable compensation\r\nfor the discovery to yourself or your representatives, or by placing it\r\nwherever you think it safest.\r\n\r\nI should be glad of a copy of any sketch or account you may have made of\r\nthe river Platte, of the passage from its head across the mountains, and\r\nof the river Cashecatungo, which you suppose to run into the Pacific. This\r\nwould probably be among the first exploring journeys we undertake after\r\na settlement with Spain, as we wish to become acquainted with all the\r\nadvantageous water connections across our continent.\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to receive some seed of the silk nettle which you\r\ndescribe, with a view to have it raised, and its uses tried. I have not\r\nbeen able to find that any of your delegates here has received it. If you\r\nwould be so good as to send me a small packet of it by post, it will come\r\nsafely, and I will immediately commit it to a person who will try it with\r\nthe utmost care. I salute you with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--You informed me that the instruments you had been so kind as\r\nto bring for me from England, would arrive at Richmond with your baggage,\r\nand you wished to know what was to be done with them there. I will ask the\r\nfavor of you to deliver them to Mr. Jefferson, who will forward them to\r\nMonticello in the way I shall advise him. And I must entreat you to send\r\nme either a note of their amount, or the bills, that I may be enabled to\r\nreimburse you. There can be no pecuniary matter between us, against which\r\nthis can be any set-off. But if, contrary to my recollection or knowledge,\r\nthere were anything, I pray that that may be left to be settled by itself.\r\nIf I could have known the amount beforehand, I should have remitted it,\r\nand asked the advance only under the idea that it should be the same as\r\nready money to you on your arrival. I must again, therefore, beseech you\r\nto let me know its amount.\r\n\r\nI see with infinite grief a contest arising between yourself and another,\r\nwho have been very dear to each other, and equally so to me. I sincerely\r\npray that these dispositions may not be affected between you; with me I\r\nconfidently trust they will not. For independently of the dictates of\r\npublic duty, which prescribes neutrality to me, my sincere friendship\r\nfor you both will ensure its sacred observance. I suffer no one to\r\nconverse with me on the subject. I already perceive my old friend Clinton,\r\nestranging himself from me. No doubt lies are carried to him, as they\r\nwill be to the other two candidates, under forms which, however false,\r\nhe can scarcely question. Yet I have been equally careful as to him\r\nalso, never to say a word on his subject. The object of the contest is\r\na fair and honorable one, equally open to you all; and I have no doubt\r\nthe personal conduct of all will be so chaste, as to offer no ground of\r\ndissatisfaction with each other. But your friends will not be as delicate.\r\nI know too well from experience the progress of political controversy,\r\nand the exacerbation of spirit into which it degenerates, not to fear\r\nfor the continuance of your mutual esteem. One piquing thing said draws\r\non another, that a third, and always with increasing acrimony, until all\r\nrestraint is thrown off, and it becomes difficult for yourselves to keep\r\nclear of the toils in which your friends will endeavor to interlace you,\r\nand to avoid the participation in their passions which they will endeavor\r\nto produce. A candid recollection of what you know of each other will be\r\nthe true corrective. With respect to myself, I hope they will spare me.\r\nMy longings for retirement are so strong, that I with difficulty encounter\r\nthe daily drudgeries of my duty. But my wish for retirement itself is not\r\nstronger than that of carrying into it the affections of all my friends.\r\nI have ever viewed Mr. Madison and yourself as two principal pillars of\r\nmy happiness. Were either to be withdrawn, I should consider it as among\r\nthe greatest calamities which could assail my future peace of mind. I\r\nhave great confidence that the candor and high understanding of both will\r\nguard me against this misfortune, the bare possibility of which has so far\r\nweighed on my mind, that I could not be easy without unburthening it.\r\n\r\nAccept my respectful salutations for yourself and Mrs. Monroe, and be\r\nassured of my constant and sincere friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH BRINGHURST.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th. It\r\ngave me the first information of the death of our distinguished fellow\r\ncitizen, John Dickinson. A more estimable man, or truer patriot, could\r\nnot have left us. Among the first of the advocates for the rights of\r\nhis country when assailed by Great Britain, he continued to the last the\r\northodox advocate of the true principles of our new government, and his\r\nname will be consecrated in history as one of the great worthies of the\r\nrevolution. We ought to be grateful for having been permitted to retain\r\nthe benefit of his counsel to so good an old age; still, the moment of\r\nlosing it, whenever it arrives, must be a moment of deep-felt regret. For\r\nhimself, perhaps, a longer period of life was less important, alloyed\r\nas the feeble enjoyments of that age are with so much pain. But to his\r\ncountry every addition to his moments was interesting. A junior companion\r\nof his labors in the early part of our revolution, it has been a great\r\ncomfort to me to have retained his friendship to the last moment of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nSincerely condoling with his friends on this affecting loss, I beg leave\r\nto tender my salutations to yourself, and assurances of my friendly\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a copy of Armstrong's letter, covering the papers\r\nsent to Congress. The date was blank, as in the copy; the letter was so\r\nimmaterial that I had really forgotten it altogether when I spoke with you\r\nlast night. I feel myself much indebted to you for having given me this\r\nprivate opportunity of showing that I have kept back nothing material.\r\nThat the federalists and a few others should by their vote make such a\r\ncharge on me, is never unexpected. But how can any join in it who call\r\nthemselves friends? The President sends papers to the House, which he\r\nthinks the public interest requires they should see. They immediately pass\r\na vote, implying irresistibly their belief that he is capable of having\r\nkept back other papers which the same interest requires they should see.\r\nThey pretend to no direct proof of this. It must, then, be founded in\r\npresumption; and on what act of my life or of my administration is such a\r\npresumption founded? What interest can I have in leading the Legislature\r\nto act on false grounds? My wish is certainly to take that course with\r\nthe public affairs which the body of the Legislature would prefer. It is\r\nsaid, indeed, that such a vote is to satisfy the federalists and their\r\npartisans. But were I to send twenty letters, they would say, \"You have\r\nkept back the twenty-first; send us that.\" If I sent one hundred, they\r\nwould say, \"There were one hundred and one;\" and how could I prove the\r\nnegative? Their malice can be cured by no conduct; it ought, therefore, to\r\nbe disregarded, instead of countenancing their imputations by the sanction\r\nof a vote. Indeed I should consider such a vote as a charge, in the face\r\nof the nation, calling for a serious and public defence of myself. I send\r\nyou a copy, that you may retain it, and make such use of it among our\r\nfriends as your prudence and friendship will deem best.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         February 28, 1808.\r\n\r\nThere is no source from whence our fair commerce derives so much vexation,\r\nor our country so much danger of war, as from forged papers and fraudulent\r\nvoyages. Nothing should, in my opinion, be spared, either of trouble or\r\nexpense on our part, to aid all nations in detecting and punishing them.\r\nI would therefore certainly direct Mr. Gelston to furnish Heinecher with\r\nevery proof in his power, and to assure him that it shall be done on all\r\noccasions. Would it not be well to give this assurance to all the foreign\r\nconsuls? It would at least show the world that this government does not\r\ncountenance those frauds; and should not instructions be given to all\r\nthe collectors to furnish all proofs in their power on demand? The three\r\nEnglishmen will, I presume, be punished by the laws of Holland, either\r\nas spies, or prisoners of war. If their laws will not take hold of our\r\nscoundrel, Gardner, of the Jane, perhaps that government would put him on\r\nboard a vessel, under the order of our consul, to be brought and punished\r\nhere for the forgery of papers. Would it not be well to put a summary\r\nstatement of this case, and of our orders on the occasion, into Smith's\r\npaper? Would it be amiss even to send it to Congress by message, with a\r\nrecommendation to provide punishments against this practice? Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                             March 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nOn considering the papers which James Brown sent us, containing a\r\nstatement of the parcels of property in and adjacent to New Orleans, to\r\nwhich the United States claims, we thought it safest to await the report\r\nof the commissioners, with their list of the property. The papers received\r\nyesterday by express from New Orleans, and now enclosed to you, give us a\r\nlist of the property, and grounds of claim from the common council of the\r\ncity. Having thus the statement, as it were, from both parties, I suppose\r\nwe may consider the list as complete. It would therefore be only losing\r\na year to wait for the report of the commissioners, and especially as the\r\nproperty is suffering. What shall we do? There are two questions,--first,\r\nwhich of these parcels do really belong to the United States? Second, how\r\nshall they be disposed of? On the first question, I presume Congress will\r\nnot decide themselves, but either leave it to the present commissioners,\r\nor appoint others of higher standing and abilities, at least for the\r\nfuture, which is of too much value, and too much involved in prejudices\r\n_there_, to be safely trusted to the present commissioners. On the second\r\nquestion, perhaps Congress might now desire the Executive, so soon as\r\nthe titles are decided, to state to them the parcels which should be kept\r\nfor the government use, and then give to the city such as they need, and\r\ndispose of the rest as they see best.\r\n\r\nWill you favor me with your ideas what is best to be done? Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 3, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of February 8th, covering the resolutions of\r\nthe Legislature of Massachusetts, was received in due time. It is\r\na circumstance of great satisfaction that the proceedings of the\r\ngovernment are approved by the respectable Legislature of Massachusetts,\r\nand especially the late important measure of the embargo. The hearty\r\nconcurrence of the States in that measure, will have a great effect in\r\nEurope. I derive great personal consolation from the assurances in your\r\nfriendly letter, that the electors of Massachusetts would still have\r\nviewed me with favor as a candidate for a third presidential term. But\r\nthe duty of retirement is so strongly impressed on my mind, that it is\r\nimpossible for me to think of that. If I can carry into retirement the\r\ngood will of my fellow citizens, nothing else will be wanting to my\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nYour letter of February 7th, with a recommendation for Salem, and that of\r\nthe 8th recalling it, were both received. I dare say you have found that\r\nthe solicitations for office are the most painful incidents to which an\r\nexecutive magistrate is exposed. The ordinary affairs of a nation offer\r\nlittle difficulty to a person of any experience; but the gift of office is\r\nthe dreadful burthen which oppresses him. A person who wishes to make it\r\nan engine of self-elevation, may do wonders with it; but to one who wishes\r\nto use it conscientiously for the public good, without regard to the ties\r\nof blood or friendship, it creates enmities without numbers, many open,\r\nbut more secret, and saps the happiness and peace of his life.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom your letter of the 27th ultimo, I perceive that painful impressions\r\nhave been made on your mind during your late mission, of which I had never\r\nentertained a suspicion. I must, therefore, examine the grounds, because\r\nexplanations between reasonable men can never but do good. 1. You consider\r\nthe mission of Mr. Pinckney as an associate, to have been in some way\r\ninjurious to you. Were I to take that measure on myself, I might say in\r\nits justification, that it has been the regular and habitual practice of\r\nthe United States to do this, under every form in which their government\r\nhas existed. I need not recapitulate the multiplied instances, because you\r\nwill readily recollect them. I went as an adjunct to Dr. Franklin and Mr.\r\nAdams, yourself as an adjunct first to Mr. Livingston, and then to Mr.\r\nPinckney, and I really believe there has scarcely been a great occasion\r\nwhich has not produced an extraordinary mission. Still, however, it is\r\nwell known that I was strongly opposed to it in the case of which you\r\ncomplain. A committee of the Senate called on me with two resolutions of\r\nthat body, on the subject of impressment and spoliations by Great Britain,\r\nand requesting that I would demand satisfaction. After delivering the\r\nresolutions, the committee entered into free conversation, and observed,\r\nthat although the Senate could not, in form, recommend any extraordinary\r\nmission, yet that as individuals, there was but one sentiment among them\r\non the measure, and they pressed it. I was so much averse to it, and gave\r\nthem so hard an answer, that they felt it, and spoke of it. But it did not\r\nend here. The members of the other House took up the subject, and set upon\r\nme individually, and these the best friends to you, as well as myself, and\r\nrepresented the responsibility which a failure to obtain redress would\r\nthrow on us both, pursuing a conduct in opposition to the opinion of\r\nnearly every member of the Legislature. I found it necessary, at length,\r\nto yield my own opinion to the general use of the national council, and\r\nit really seemed to produce a jubilee among them; not from any want of\r\nconfidence in you, but from a belief in the effect which an extraordinary\r\nmission would have on the British mind, by demonstrating the degree of\r\nimportance which this country attached to the rights which we considered\r\nas infracted.\r\n\r\n2. You complain of the manner in which the treaty was received. But what\r\nwas that manner? I cannot suppose you to have given a moment's credit to\r\nthe stuff which was crowded in all sorts of forms into the public papers,\r\nor to the thousand speeches they put into my mouth, not a word of which\r\nI had ever uttered. I was not insensible at the time of the views to\r\nmischief, with which these lies were fabricated. But my confidence was\r\nfirm, that neither yourself nor the British government, equally outraged\r\nby them, would believe me capable of making the editors of newspapers the\r\nconfidants of my speeches or opinions. The fact was this. The treaty was\r\ncommunicated to us by Mr. Erskine on the day Congress was to rise. Two of\r\nthe Senators inquired of me in the evening, whether it was my purpose to\r\ndetain them on account of the treaty. My answer was, \"that it was not:\r\nthat the treaty containing no provision against the impressment of our\r\nseamen, and being accompanied by a kind of protestation of the British\r\nministers, which would leave that government free to consider it as a\r\ntreaty or no treaty, according to their own convenience, I should not\r\ngive them the trouble of deliberating on it.\" This was substantially,\r\nand almost verbally, what I said whenever spoken to about it, and I\r\nnever failed when the occasion would admit of it, to justify yourself\r\nand Mr. Pinckney, by expressing my conviction, that it was all that\r\ncould be obtained from the British government; that you had told their\r\ncommissioners that your government could not be pledged to ratify, because\r\nit was contrary to their instructions; of course, that it should be\r\nconsidered but as a project; and in this light I stated it publicly in my\r\nmessage to Congress on the opening of the session. Not a single article of\r\nthe treaty was ever made known beyond the members of the administration,\r\nnor would an article of it be known at this day, but for its publication\r\nin the newspapers, as communicated by somebody from beyond the water, as\r\nwe have always understood. But as to myself, I can solemnly protest, as\r\nthe most sacred of truths, that I never, one instant, lost sight of your\r\nreputation and favorable standing with your country, and never omitted\r\nto justify your failure to attain our wish, as one which was probably\r\nunattainable. Reviewing therefore, this whole subject, I cannot doubt\r\nyou will become sensible, that your impressions have been without just\r\nground. I cannot, indeed, judge what falsehoods may have been written or\r\ntold you; and that, under such forms as to command belief. But you will\r\nsoon find, my dear Sir, that so inveterate is the rancor of party spirit\r\namong us, that nothing ought to be credited but what we hear with our\r\nown ears. If you are less on your guard than we are here, at this moment,\r\nthe designs of the mischief-makers will not fail to be accomplished, and\r\nbrethren and friends will be made strangers and enemies to each other,\r\nwithout ever having said or thought a thing amiss of each other. I presume\r\nthat the most insidious falsehoods are daily carried to you, as they are\r\nbrought to me, to engage us in the passions of our informers, and stated\r\nso positively and plausibly as to make even _doubt_ a rudeness to the\r\nnarrator; who, imposed on himself, has no other than the friendly view\r\nof putting us on our guard. My answer is, invariably, that my knowledge\r\nof your character is better testimony to me of a negative, than any\r\naffirmative which my informant did not hear _from yourself_ with his own\r\nears. In fact, when you shall have been a little longer among us, you\r\nwill find that little is to be believed which interests the prevailing\r\npassions, and happens beyond the limits of our own senses. Let us not\r\nthen, my dear friend, embark our happiness and our affections on the ocean\r\nof slander, of falsehood and of malice, on which our credulous friends\r\nare floating. If you have been made to believe that I ever did, said, or\r\nthought a thing unfriendly to your fame and feelings, you do me injury as\r\ncauseless as it is afflicting to me. In the present contest in which you\r\nare concerned, I feel no passion, I take no part, I express no sentiment.\r\nWhichever of my friends is called to the supreme cares of the nation, I\r\nknow that they will be wisely and faithfully administered, and as far as\r\nmy individual conduct can influence, they shall be cordially supported.\r\nFor myself I have nothing further to ask of the world, than to preserve\r\nin retirement so much of their esteem as I may have fairly earned, and\r\nto be permitted to pass in tranquillity, in the bosom of my family and\r\nfriends, the days which yet remain for me. Having reached the harbor\r\nmyself, I shall view with anxiety (but certainly not with a wish to be in\r\ntheir place) those who are still buffetting the storm, uncertain of their\r\nfate. Your voyage has so far been favorable, and that it may continue with\r\nentire prosperity, is the sincere prayer of that friendship which I have\r\never borne you, and of which I now assure you, with the tender of my high\r\nrespect and affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RICHARD M. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am sure you can too justly estimate my occupations; to need\r\nan apology for this tardy acknowledgment of your favor of February the\r\n27th. I cannot but be deeply sensible of the good opinion you are pleased\r\nto express of my conduct in the administration of our government. This\r\napprobation of my fellow citizens is the richest reward I can receive. I\r\nam conscious of having always intended to do what was best for them; and\r\nnever, for a single moment, to have listened to any personal interest of\r\nmy own. It has been a source of great pain to me, to have met with so many\r\namong our opponents, who had not the liberality to distinguish between\r\npolitical and social opposition; who transferred at once to the person,\r\nthe hatred they bore to his political opinions. I suppose, indeed, that in\r\npublic life, a man whose political principles have any decided character,\r\nand who has energy enough to give them effect, must always expect to\r\nencounter political hostility from those of adverse principles. But I\r\ncame to the government under circumstances calculated to generate peculiar\r\nacrimony. I found all its offices in the possession of a political sect,\r\nwho wished to transform it ultimately into the shape of their darling\r\nmodel, the English government; and in the meantime, to familiarize the\r\npublic mind to the change, by administering it on English principles, and\r\nin English forms. The elective interposition of the people had blown all\r\ntheir designs, and they found themselves and their fortresses of power and\r\nprofit put in a moment into the hands of other trustees. Lamentations and\r\ninvective were all that remained to them. This last was naturally directed\r\nagainst the agent selected to execute the multiplied reformations, which\r\ntheir heresies had rendered necessary. I became of course the butt of\r\neverything which reason, ridicule, malice and falsehood could supply. They\r\nhave concentrated all their hatred on me, till they have really persuaded\r\nthemselves, that I am the sole source of all their imaginary evils. I\r\nhope, therefore, that my retirement will abate some of their disaffection\r\nto the government of their country, and that my successor will enter on a\r\ncalmer sea than I did. He will at least find the vessel of state in the\r\nhands of his friends, and not of his foes. Federalism is dead, without\r\neven the hope of a day of resurrection. The quondam leaders, indeed,\r\nretain their rancor and principles; but their followers are amalgamated\r\nwith us in sentiment, if not in name. If our fellow citizens, now solidly\r\nrepublican, will sacrifice favoritism towards men for the preservation of\r\nprinciple, we may hope that no divisions will again endanger a degeneracy\r\nin our government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept my salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 11, 1808.\r\n\r\nI suppose we must despatch another packet by the 1st of April at farthest.\r\nI take it to be an universal opinion that war will become preferable to\r\na continuance of the embargo after a certain time. Should we not then\r\navail ourselves of the intervening period to procure a retraction of the\r\nobnoxious decrees peaceably, if possible? An opening is given us by both\r\nparties, sufficient to form a basis for such a proposition.\r\n\r\nI wish you to consider, therefore, the following course of proceeding, to\r\nwit:\r\n\r\nTo instruct our ministers at Paris and London, by the next packet, to\r\npropose immediately to both those powers a declaration on both sides that\r\nthese decrees and orders shall no longer be extended to vessels of the\r\nUnited States, in which case we shall remain faithfully neutral; but,\r\nwithout assuming the air of menace, to let them both perceive that if they\r\ndo not withdraw these orders and decrees, there will arrive a time when\r\nour interests will render war preferable to a continuance of the embargo;\r\nthat when that time arrives, if one has withdrawn and the other not, we\r\nmust declare war against that other; if neither shall have withdrawn, we\r\nmust take our choice of enemies between them. This it will certainly be\r\nour duty to have ascertained by the time Congress shall meet in the fall\r\nor beginning of winter; so that taking off the embargo, they may decide\r\nwhether war must be declared, and against whom. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received last night your favor of the 10th. There can\r\ncertainly be no present objection to the forwarding the letters therein\r\nmentioned, according to their address.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing new of importance, except that at the last reading of\r\nan amendatory bill a few days ago, the House of Representatives were\r\nsurprised into the insertion of an insidious clause permitting any\r\nmerchant having _property_ abroad, on proving it to the executive, to send\r\na ship for it. We are already overwhelmed with applications, and there is\r\nreal danger that the great object of the embargo in keeping our ships and\r\nseamen out of harm's way, will be defeated; and every vessel and seaman\r\nsent out under this pretext, and placed in the prize of the belligerent\r\ntyrants. I salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 17, 1808.\r\n\r\nI think it will be impossible to form general rules for carrying into\r\nexecution the seventh section of the law of March 12th, without a fuller\r\nview of the number and nature of the cases which are to come under it.\r\nI have waited in expectation the applications would multiply so as to\r\ngive one a general view, but I have received but about half a dozen. But,\r\nindeed, nothing short of a knowledge of all the cases can enable us to\r\nprovide for them. I have been wishing, therefore, to converse with you on\r\nthis proposition; to wit, to direct the collectors to advertize in their\r\nrespective ports, that all persons desiring the benefit of that law, must\r\n_immediately_ deliver to him a statement of the _place_ where they have\r\nproperty, its _amount_, whether _cash_ or _goods_, and what _kind_ of\r\ngoods, and in whose _hands_, on oath, but without exhibiting other proofs\r\ntill further called on. These particulars may be stated in a tabular view;\r\nfor _cash_ we might authorize vessels to go immediately, but for goods\r\nrules must be framed on a view of all circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the constitution of the act, there are cases in the books\r\nwhere the word \"may\" has been adjudged equivalent to \"shall,\" but the term\r\n\"is authorized,\" unless followed by \"and required,\" was, I think, never so\r\nconsidered. On the contrary, I believe it is the very term which Congress\r\nalways use toward the executive when they mean to give a power to him, and\r\nleave the use of it to his discretion.\r\n\r\nIt is the very phrase on which there is now a difference in the House\r\nof Representatives, on the bill for raising 6,000 regulars, which says\r\n\"there shall be raised,\" and some desire it to say \"the President is\r\nauthorized to raise,\" leaving him the power with a discretion to use it\r\nor not. It is to be observed also that the one construction puts it in\r\nthe power of individuals to defeat the embargo in a great measure, while\r\nthe other leaves a power to combine a due regard to the object of the law\r\nwith the interests of individuals. I like your idea of proportioning the\r\ntonnage of the vessel to the value (in some degree) of the property, but\r\nits bulk must also be taken into consideration. On the whole, I should\r\nbe for giving prompt permission to bring home money, because one vessel\r\nwill bring for all those who have cash at the same port; but the bringing\r\nproperty in other forms, will require a fuller view and digest of rules.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. C. NICHOLAS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 18th is duly received. Be assured that I\r\nvalue no act of friendship so highly as the communicating facts to me,\r\nwhich I am not in the way of knowing otherwise, and could not therefore\r\notherwise guard against. I have had too many proofs of your friendship not\r\nto be sensible of the kindness of these communications, and to receive\r\nthem with peculiar obligation. The receipt of Mr. Rose's answer has\r\nfurnished the happiest occasion for me to present to Congress a complete\r\nview of the ground on which we stand with the two principal belligerents,\r\nand, with respect to France, to lay before them, _for the public_, every\r\ncommunication received from that government since the last session,\r\nincluding those heretofore sent, in order that they also may be published,\r\nand let our constituents see whether these papers gave just ground for the\r\nfalsehoods which have been so impudently advanced. We shall hope to see\r\nyou to-day. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WISTAR.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 12th is received. Congress, I think, will rise in\r\nabout three weeks,--say about the 11th of April, and I shall leave this\r\nfive or six days after, on a visit of some length to Monticello. This\r\nilly accords with your journey to the westward in May; but can you not\r\nseparate your excursion to this place from the western journey? Between\r\nPhiladelphia and this place is but two days, and the roads are already\r\nfine. I would propose, therefore, that you should come a few days before\r\nCongress rises, so as to satisfy that article of your curiosity. The\r\nbones are spread in a large room, where you can work at your leisure,\r\nundisturbed by any mortal, from morning till night, taking your breakfast\r\nand dinner with us. It is a precious collection, consisting of upwards\r\nof three hundred bones, few of them of the large kinds which are already\r\npossessed. There are four pieces of the head, one very clear, and\r\ndistinctly presenting the whole face of the animal. The height of his\r\nforehead is most remarkable. In this figure, the indenture at the eye\r\ngives a prominence of six inches to the forehead. There are four jaw-bones\r\ntolerably entire, with several teeth in them, and some fragments; three\r\ntusks like elephants; one ditto totally different, the largest probably\r\never seen, being now from nine to ten feet long, though broken off at both\r\nends; some ribs; an abundance of teeth studded, and also of those of the\r\nstriated or ribbed kind; a fore-leg complete; and then about two hundred\r\nsmall bones, chiefly of the foot. This is probably the most valuable part\r\nof the collection, for General Clarke, aware that we had specimens of the\r\nlarger bones, has gathered up everything of the small kind. There is one\r\nhorn of a colossal animal. The bones which came do not correspond exactly\r\nwith General Clarke's description; probably there were some omissions of\r\nhis packers. Having sent my books to Monticello, I have nothing here to\r\nassist you but the Encyclopedie Methodique. I hope you will make this a\r\nseparate excursion; and come before Congress rises, whenever it best suits\r\nyou. I salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DEMOCRATIC CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY OF ADAMS, PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nI see with pleasure, fellow citizens, in your address of February 15th,\r\na sound recurrence to the first principles on which our government is\r\nfounded; an examination by that test of the rights we possess, and the\r\nwrongs we have suffered; a just line drawn between a wholesome attention\r\nto the conduct of rulers, and a too ready censure of that conduct on\r\nevery unfounded rumor; between the love of peace, and the determination\r\nto meet war, when its evils shall be less intolerable than the wrongs it\r\nis meant to correct. With so just a view of principles and circumstances,\r\nyour approbation of my conduct, under the difficulties which have beset us\r\non every side, is doubly valued by me, and offers high encouragement to\r\na perseverance in my best endeavors for the preservation of your peace,\r\nso long as it shall be consistent with the preservation of your rights.\r\nWhen this ceases to be practicable, I feel entire confidence in the\r\narduous exertions which you pledge in support of the measures which may be\r\ncalled for by the exigencies of the times, and in the known energies and\r\nenterprize of our countrymen in whatsoever direction they are pointed. If\r\nthese energies are embodied by an union of will, and by a confidence in\r\nthose who direct it, our nation, so favored in its situation, has nothing\r\nto fear from any quarter. To that union of effort may our citizens ever\r\nrally, minorities falling cordially, on the decision of a question, into\r\nthe ranks of the majority, and bearing always in mind that a nation ceases\r\nto be republican only when the will of the majority ceases to be the law.\r\nI thank you, fellow citizens, for the solicitude you kindly express for\r\nmy future welfare. A retirement from the exercise of my present charge is\r\nequally for your good and my own happiness. Gratitude for past favors, and\r\naffectionate concern for the liberty and prosperity of my fellow citizens,\r\nwill cease but with life to animate my breast.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim of our municipal law, and, I believe, of universal law, that\r\nhe who permits the _end_, permits of course the _means_, without which\r\nthe end cannot be effected. The law permitting rum, molasses, and sugar,\r\nto be imported from countries which have not packages for them, would be\r\nconstrued in the most rigorous courts to permit them to be carried. They\r\nwould consider the restriction to ballast and provisions as a restriction\r\nto necessaries, and merely equivalent to a declaration that they shall\r\ncarry out nothing for sale.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly one object of the law, and the second is to import the\r\nproperty; and to these objects all constructions of it should be directed.\r\nI have no doubt, therefore, that Messrs. Low and Wallace, and others,\r\nshould be allowed to carry out the necessary and sufficient packages. But\r\na right to take care that the law is not evaded, allows us to prescribe\r\nthat kind of package which can be best guarded against fraud. Boxes\r\nready-made could not, perhaps, be so easily probed, to discover if they\r\ncontained nothing for exportation. Casks filled with water can be easily\r\nsounded from the bunghole. If you think, therefore, that one kind of\r\npackage is safer than another, it may be prescribed; for that nothing for\r\nsale shall be exported is as much the object of the law, as that their\r\nproperty shall be imported. Reasonable attention is due to each object.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LE VAVASSEUR.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 23, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am sensible of the extraordinary ingenuity and merit of the work\r\nwhich you offer to the acquisition of our government. It would certainly\r\nbe an ornament to any country. But with such an immense extent of country\r\nbefore us, wanting common improvement to render it productive, the United\r\nStates have not thought the moment as yet arrived when it would be wise\r\nin them to divert their funds to objects less pressing; no law has yet\r\nauthorized acquisitions of this character. The idea of rendering the Greek\r\nand Latin languages living, has certainly some captivating points. The\r\nexperiment has, I believe, been tried in Europe as to the Latin language,\r\nbut with what degree of success I am not precisely informed. I suppose it\r\nvery possible to reform the language of the modern Greeks to the ancient\r\nstandard, and that this may one day take place. But in our infant country\r\nobjects more urgent force themselves on our attention, and call for the\r\naid of all our means. These peculiarities of our situation deprive us of\r\nthe advantage of availing our country of propositions which, in a more\r\nadvanced stage of improvement, might be entitled to consideration.\r\n\r\nPermit me to tender my salutations, and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter on the subject of Mr. Lee came safely to hand.\r\nYou know our principles render federalists in office safe, if they do not\r\nemploy their influence in opposing the government, but only give their own\r\nvote according to their conscience. And this principle we act on as well\r\nwith those put in office by others, as by ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have received from your presses a very malevolent and incendiary\r\ndenunciation of the administration, bottomed on absolute falsehood from\r\nbeginning to end. The author would merit exemplary punishment for so\r\nflagitious a libel, were not the torment of his own abominable temper\r\npunishment sufficient for even as base a crime as this. The termination\r\nof Mr. Rose's mission, _re infecta_, put it in my power to communicate\r\nto Congress yesterday, everything respecting our relations with England\r\nand France, which will effectually put down Mr. Pickering, and his worthy\r\ncoadjutor Mr. Quincy. Their tempers are so much alike, and really their\r\npersons, as to induce a supposition that they are related. The embargo\r\nappears to be approved, even by the federalists of every quarter except\r\nyours. The alternative was between that and war, and in fact, it is\r\nthe last card we have to play, short of war. But if peace does not take\r\nplace in Europe, and if France and England will not consent to withdraw\r\nthe operation of their decrees and orders from us, when Congress shall\r\nmeet in December, they will have to consider at what point of time the\r\nembargo, continued, becomes a greater evil than war. I am inclined to\r\nbelieve, we shall have this summer and autumn to prepare for the defence\r\nof our seaport towns, and hope that in that time, the works of defence\r\nwill be completed which have been provided for by the Legislature. I think\r\nCongress will rise within three weeks.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 26, 1808.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison happening to call on me just now, I consulted him on the\r\nsubject of Hoffman's letter. We both think that it would be neither just\r\nnor expedient that the supplies necessary to the existence of the Indians\r\nshould be cut off from them; and that if no construction of the embargo\r\nlaw will permit the passage of their commerce, and if that law could,\r\nand did intend to control the treaty, (the last of which is hardly to be\r\nbelieved,) then an amendment should be asked of Congress. I have no copy\r\nof the law by me, and indeed am too unwell for very close exercise of the\r\nmind. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 8th was received on the 25th, and I\r\nproceed to state to you my views of the present state and prospect of\r\nforeign affairs, under the confidence that you will use them for your own\r\ngovernment and opinions only, and by no means let them get out as from\r\nme. With France we are in no _immediate_ danger of war. Her future views\r\nit is impossible to estimate. The immediate danger we are in of a rupture\r\nwith England, is postponed for this year. This is effected by the embargo,\r\nas the question was simply between that and war. That may go on a certain\r\ntime, perhaps through the year, without the loss of their property to\r\nour citizens, but only its remaining unemployed on their hands. A time\r\nwould come, however, when war would be preferable to a continuance of the\r\nembargo. Of this Congress may have to decide at their next meeting. In the\r\nmeantime, we have good information, that a negotiation for peace between\r\nFrance and England is commencing through the medium of Austria. The way\r\nfor it has been smoothed by a determination expressed by France (through\r\nthe Moniteur, which is their government paper) that herself and her allies\r\nwill demand from Great Britain no renunciation of her maritime principles;\r\nnor will they renounce theirs. Nothing shall be said about them in the\r\ntreaty, and both sides will be left in the next war to act on their own.\r\nNo doubt the meaning of this is, that all the _Continental_ powers of\r\nEurope will form themselves into an armed neutrality, to enforce their own\r\nprinciples. Should peace be made, we shall have safely rode out the storm\r\nin peace and prosperity. If we have anything to fear, it will be after\r\nthat. Nothing should be spared from this moment in putting our militia in\r\nthe best condition possible, and procuring arms. I hope, that this summer,\r\nwe shall get our whole seaports put into that state of defence, which\r\nCongress has thought proportioned to our circumstances and situation;\r\nthat is to say, put _hors d'insulte_ from a maritime attack, by a moderate\r\nsquadron. If armies are combined with their fleets, then no resource can\r\nbe provided, but to meet them in the field. We propose to raise seven\r\nregiments only for the present year, depending always on our militia for\r\nthe operations of the first year of war. On any other plan, we should\r\nbe obliged always to keep a large standing army. Congress will adjourn\r\nin about three weeks. I hope Captain McComb is getting on well with your\r\ndefensive works. We shall be able by mid-summer, to give you a sufficient\r\nnumber of gun-boats to protect Charleston from any vessel which can cross\r\nthe bar; but the militia of the place must be depended on to fill up the\r\ncomplement of men necessary for action in the moment of an attack, as we\r\nshall man them, in ordinary, but with their navigating crew of eight or\r\nten good seamen.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 31, 1808.\r\n\r\nIf, on considering the doubts I shall suggest, you shall still think your\r\ndraught of a supplementary embargo law sufficient, in its present form,\r\nI shall be satisfied it is so, for I have but one hour in the morning in\r\nwhich I am capable of thinking, and that is too much crowded with business\r\nto give me time to think.\r\n\r\n1. Is not the first paragraph against the Constitution, which says no\r\npreference shall be given to the ports of one State over those of another?\r\nYou might put down those ports as ports of entry, if that could be made to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n2. Could not your second paragraph be made to answer by making it say that\r\nno clearance shall be furnished to any vessel laden with _provisions_\r\nor _lumber_, to go from one port to another of the United States,\r\nwithout special permission, &c. In that case we might lay down rules for\r\nthe necessary removal of provisions and lumber, inland, which should\r\ngive no trouble to the citizens, but refuse licenses for all coasting\r\ntransportation of those articles but on such applications from a Governor\r\nas may ensure us against any exportation but for the consumption of his\r\nState. Portsmouth, Boston, Charleston, and Savannah, are the only ports\r\nwhich cannot be supplied inland. I should like to prohibit _collections_,\r\nalso, made evidently for clandestine importation.\r\n\r\n3. I would rather strike out the words \"in conformity with treaty\" in\r\norder to avoid any express recognition at this day of that article of the\r\nBritish treaty. It has been so flagrantly abused as to excite the Indians\r\nto war against us, that I should have no hesitation in declaring it null,\r\nas soon as we see means of supplying the Indians ourselves.\r\n\r\nI should have no objections to extend the exception to the Indian furs\r\npurchased by our traders and sent into Canada. Affectionate salutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                             April 1, 1808.\r\n\r\nI approve of your letter to Commodore Murray entirely, and in order to\r\nsettle what shall be our course for the summer (now that we are tolerably\r\nclear, that no rupture with England is likely to take place during the\r\nsummer), I propose, the first day that I can be well enough, for a couple\r\nof hours to ask a meeting of our colleagues to determine these questions.\r\n\r\nShall the proclamation be renewed or suffered to expire?\r\n\r\nShall the harbors of ordinary British resort (say New York, Lynhaven, and\r\nCharleston) be furnished with their full quota of gun-boats, with their\r\n_navigating_ crews?\r\n\r\nShall the residue of the 170 gun-boats be distributed among the other\r\nports, with their navigating crews, or be laid up or left on their stocks?\r\n\r\nShall the frigates and Wasp be unmanned?\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                             April 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--On the amendments to the embargo law, I am perfectly satisfied with\r\nwhatever you have concluded on after consideration of the subject. My view\r\nwas only to suggest for your consideration, not having at all made myself\r\nacquainted with the details of that law. I therefore return you your bill,\r\nand wish it to be proposed. I will this day nominate Elmer. The delegates\r\nof North Carolina expect daily to receive information on the subject of\r\na Marshal. Is the Register's office at New Orleans vacant? Claiborne says\r\nit is, and strongly recommends Robertson the Secretary. He will be found\r\none of the most valuable men we have brought into the public service for\r\nintegrity, talents and amiability. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                             April 8, 1808.\r\n\r\nI suppose that Favre can carry his necessary provisions from New Orleans\r\nacross the lake in a periagua or some other vessel, which may come under\r\nthe exception of vessels under the immediate direction of the President,\r\nand that being an agent of the United States for the transmission of\r\npublic intelligence, such a license is perfectly legitimate. If this were\r\na matter of doubt, its solution would be to be sought in the intention of\r\nthe Legislature, which was to keep our seamen and property from capture,\r\nand to starve the offending nations. But Favre is our own agent, and we\r\nmay as well remit provisions to him as money to our other foreign agents.\r\nIt appears to me to be so clearly out of the scope of the prohibitions of\r\nthe embargo law, and within its exceptions, that I should be for allowing\r\nhim to take out his provisions for his family, under the superintendence\r\nof the Collector. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN JACOB ASTOR.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have regretted the delay of this answer to your letter of February\r\n27th, but it has proceeded from circumstances which did not depend on\r\nme. I learn with great satisfaction the disposition of our merchants\r\nto form into companies for undertaking the Indian trade within our own\r\nterritories. I have been taught to believe it an advantageous one for\r\nthe individual adventurers, and I consider it as highly desirable to have\r\nthat trade centred in the hands of our own citizens. The field is immense,\r\nand would occupy a vast extent of capital by different companies engaging\r\nin different districts. All beyond the Mississippi is ours exclusively,\r\nand it will be in our power to give our own traders great advantages\r\nover their foreign competitors on this side the Mississippi. You may be\r\nassured that in order to get the whole of this business passed into the\r\nhands of our own citizens, and to oust foreign traders, who so much abuse\r\ntheir privilege by endeavoring to excite the Indians to war on us, every\r\nreasonable patronage and facility in the power of the Executive will be\r\nafforded. I salute you with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 14, 1808.\r\n\r\nI should think Mr. Woodside's application to send provisions for the\r\nfamily of our consul at Madeira, admissible on the same ground as that\r\nlately to Favre, were the necessity as evident, but I suppose it can\r\nhardly be doubted that England will procure provisions for that island,\r\nand there is danger of one precedent in our relaxations begetting another\r\ntill we may get out of the limits of the law and its object.\r\n\r\nThe application for the establishment of a packet on Lake Champlain cannot\r\nbe admitted. Such an establishment is by no means within the description\r\nof those which we have proposed to license; it would give too great a\r\nfacility to evade the law, and the builder is in no worse situation than\r\nthe many others who began their vessels before the embargo law, and who\r\nwill not be permitted to use them till that is repealed. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Sincerely sympathizing in your distress, which much experience\r\nin the same school has taught me to estimate, I could not have been\r\ninduced to intrude on it by anything short of the urgency of the case\r\nstated by Penniman on Lake Champlain. Messrs. Robinson and Witherall tell\r\nme the whole of the business will be over early in May, when the fall of\r\nthe water renders the rapids impassable for rafts. They think vessels\r\nof any kind desired, can be had on the Lake at a moment's warning, and\r\nguns of 6 lbs. ball, there also, mounted on them by procurement of the\r\ncollector, and that the governor would order any assistance of militia\r\non being written to. Believing it important to crush every example of\r\nforcible opposition to the law, I propose to ask the other gentlemen to a\r\nconsultation immediately, and for their and my guide have to request any\r\nideas on the subject which you can hastily give me on paper, for which I\r\nwould not have troubled you, but from a confidence that your knowledge of\r\nthe character and means possessed by the collector there, and of the local\r\ncircumstances to be attended to, may enable us to decide on what will be\r\nmost proper and effectual. I salute you with affection.\r\n\r\nP. S. Return me Penniman's letter if you please, to lay before the\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nWe have concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. That a letter from your department to the collector on Lake\r\nChamplain, shall instruct him to equip and arm what vessels he can and\r\nmay think necessary, and luggage as many persons on board them as may\r\nbe necessary, and can be engaged _voluntarily_ by force of arms, or\r\notherwise, to enforce the law.\r\n\r\n2d. The Secretary of State writes to the Marshall, if the opposition to\r\nthe law is too powerful for the collector, to raise his posse, (which, as\r\na peace officer, he is fully authorized to do on any forcible breach of\r\nthe peace,) and to aid in suppressing the insurrection or combination.\r\n\r\n3d. The Secretary at War desires the Governor, if the posse is inadequate,\r\nto publish a proclamation with which he is furnished, and to call on\r\nthe militia. He is further, by a private letter, requested to repair to\r\nthe place, and lend the aid of his counsel and authority according to\r\nexigencies.\r\n\r\nWe have further determined to build two gun-boats at Skanesborough.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nP. S. General Dearborne has Penniman's letter to copy for the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 22, 1808.\r\n\r\nDid I lend you the Pennsylvania act permitting our Western road to pass\r\nthrough that State? If I did, or if you have a copy of it, I shall be\r\nvery glad to see it. Mr. Hodge gave me notice yesterday that there would\r\nbe legal opposition to that road's passing in any other direction than\r\nthrough Washington, their construction being, that if in fact a _good_\r\nroad can be got by Washington, the law obliges me to direct it through\r\nthat; and they have got a survey made on which they affirm the fact to\r\nbe that a _good_ road may be had. I know my determination was not to\r\nyield to the example of a State's prescribing the direction of the road;\r\nand I understood the law as leaving the route ultimately to me. If I\r\nhave misconstrued the law, I shall be sorry for the money spent on a\r\nmisconstruction, but that loss will be a lesser evil to the United States\r\nthan a single example of yielding to a State the direction of a road made\r\nat the national expense and for national purposes. If you have not the\r\nlaw, I must write by this day's post to Mr. Moore, to suspend all further\r\nproceedings till we can see whether we are really at liberty to pursue the\r\nroute we have proposed, or must adopt another which shall not enter the\r\nState of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nMy ideas on the questions relative to the active letter of Marque stated\r\nin your letter of yesterday, are as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. Letters of Marque have been considered, ever since the decisions\r\nof 1703, to be of a mixed character, but that the commercial character\r\npredominates; and as a commercial vessel of private property we have in\r\nsome cases since the proclamation of July, considered them as not included\r\nin its restrictions.\r\n\r\n2d. The law of 1794, June 5th, certainly exempts the enlistment of\r\nforeigners in this country on board the vessels of their sovereign, from\r\nthe penalties of that law, and leaves the subject merely under the law of\r\nnations. By that law the right of enlistment in a neutral country, given\r\nto both belligerents if they can devise equal advantage from it, is no\r\nbreach of neutrality, but otherwise becomes questionable. We may, justly,\r\nI think, permit a vessel of either nation to supply its desertions by new\r\nengagements; but we should be cautious as to permitting them to increase\r\ntheir number, to carry away more than they brought in.\r\n\r\n3d. It is difficult to draw a line between the two cases where the\r\ncollector should consult the government, and where the district attorney.\r\nWhere a case is political, rather than legal, or where it arises even on\r\na _law_ whose object is rather political than municipal, the government\r\nshould be consulted; and where the district attorney is the proper resort,\r\nstill it should be on consultation by the collector, and not by the party\r\ninterested. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nNotes on the British claims in the Mississippi territory.\r\n\r\n1803, March 3d, act of Congress gave to March 31, 1804, to exhibit their\r\nclaims on grants.\r\n\r\n1804, March 27, act of Congress gave to November 30, 1804, and allowed\r\ntranscripts instead of originals, &c.\r\n\r\n1805, March 2d, act of Congress gave to December 1, 1805, to file their\r\ngrants. And in fact to Jan 1, 1807, time when the sale might begin.\r\n\r\n1807, December 15, the British claimants memorialize again.\r\n\r\nOn no one of the acts did the British claimant take any step towards\r\nspecifying his claim or its location, but remained inactive till the time\r\nwas expired, and then remonstrated to his government that we had not given\r\nthem time sufficient. And on the last of 1805, instead of having come\r\nforward with his claims, ready to avail himself of the third term which\r\nwas then to be asked, and which was granted nominally to December 1, 1805,\r\nbut in effect to January 1, 1807, he stays at home inactive, and on the\r\n15th of December, 1807, again gives in a memorial that we have not given\r\ntime enough, but still takes no step to inform us what and where his claim\r\nis.\r\n\r\nAlthough these titles may have been confirmed by treaty, yet they\r\ncould not thereby be intended to be withdrawn from the jurisdiction or\r\nconditions on which lands are held even by citizens. It is evident that\r\nthese claimants are speculators, whose object is to make what profit they\r\ncan out of the patronage of the government, but to make no sacrifice of\r\nthemselves either of money or trouble. They are entitled, therefore, to\r\nno further notice from either government. However, Mr. Erskine may be\r\ninformed _verbally_, that as the day of commencing sales of lands there\r\nis now put off to January 1, 1809, if any of these claimants will, before\r\nthat day, file their claim, with its _precise location_, the executive\r\nis authorized to suspend the sale of any particular parcels, and will as\r\nto that, till the proper authority can decide on the title, but that the\r\nsettlement of that country in general, is too pressing to be delayed one\r\nday by claims under the circumstances of these.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe leading object of the enclosed application from the owners of the\r\nTopaz, is to send witnesses and documents to save the property of the\r\nship and cargo seized. But as the Topaz would be insufficient to bring\r\nhome the whole property if cleared, the permission of sending a vessel\r\nmay be on the ordinary ground of bringing home the property. But do the\r\nrestrictions of the embargo laws (for I have them not) inhibit the passing\r\nfrom port to port as proposed in the enclosed? And do they admit, (in case\r\nthe Topaz and her cargo are condemned,) that the vessel sent out should\r\nbring home other property to cover the expenses of the ineffectual voyage?\r\nOn these questions I must ask your opinion, as General Smith will call\r\non me to-morrow. The questions had been brought to me originally by Mr.\r\nTaylor, because he happened to come at a moment when you were confined.\r\nAffectionate salutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WM. RODNEY.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson returns the enclosed to Mr. Rodney, with thanks for\r\nthe communication. It is very evident that our embargo, added to the\r\nexclusions from the Continent, will be most heavily felt in England and\r\nIreland. Liverpool is remonstrating, and endeavoring to get the other\r\nposts into motion. Yet the bill confirming the orders of council is\r\nordered to a third reading, which shows it will pass. Congress has just\r\npassed an additional embargo law, on which if we act as boldly as I am\r\ndisposed to do, we can make it effectual. I think the material parts of\r\nthe enclosed should be published. It will show our people that while the\r\nembargo gives us double rations, it is starving our enemies. This six\r\nmonths' session has worn me down to a state of almost total incapacity for\r\nbusiness. Congress will certainly rise to-morrow night, and I shall leave\r\nthis for Monticello on the 5th of May, to be here again on the 8th of\r\nJune. I salute you with constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--So uncertain has been the situation of our affairs with\r\nEngland, and yet so much bearing would they have on those with the\r\nIndians, that I have delayed answering your favor of October 5th until I\r\ncould see a little way before me. At present I think a continuance of our\r\npeace till the next meeting of Congress (November) probable. I have now\r\naddressed a message to the Indians in the north-west, in which I inform\r\nthem of our differences with England, and of the uncertainty how they will\r\nissue. Assure them of the continuance of our friendship, and advise them\r\nin any event to remain quiet at home, taking no part in our quarrel, and\r\ndeclaring unequivocally that if any nation takes up the hatchet against\r\nus, we will drive them from the land of their fathers, and never more\r\npermit their return. With respect to the prophet, I really believe the\r\nopinion you formed of his views is correct. But we have heard so many\r\ndifferent stories since, that we are awaiting some information which\r\nwe expect to receive before we make up a definitive opinion. This much,\r\nhowever, we determine; and he might know that if we become dissatisfied\r\nthat his views are friendly, we shall extend to him all the patronage\r\nand good offices in our power, and shall establish a store in his new\r\nsettlement; and particularly if we find him endeavoring to reform the\r\nmorality of the Indians, and encourage them in industry and peace, we\r\nshall do what we can to render his influence as extensive as possible.\r\nI had been in hopes that a change in the British ministry would have\r\nproduced a revocation of the orders of council, which called for our\r\nembargo, and an European peace, so as to have removed all danger of our\r\nbeing dragged into the war. But our advices to the 14th of March show\r\nthey still retained a good majority in Parliament. Should they continue\r\nin office, our peace will continue uncertain. Accept my salutations, and\r\nassurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_Case of the Fleusburg._\r\n\r\nOur laws permit a foreigner to hold any property in our country, except\r\nlands. A foreigner may contract for a ship to be built for him, so that\r\nshe will be his from the time of laying the keel; or he may contract so\r\nas that she shall be his only when launched, or when rigged, &c. The act\r\nof delivery to him or his agents fixes, in that case, the moment when she\r\nbecomes his property. If the Fleusburg was delivered to the agent of the\r\nDanish merchant, by such an act of delivery as by our laws will transfer\r\npersonal property, before the 22d of December, she was then Danish\r\nproperty. The statement says that a bill of building and sale, dated\r\nDecember 10th, proved her to be then Danish property. If the collector\r\nshall find that she was actually Danish property before December 22d, I\r\nshould think her entitled as a foreign vessel. I suppose she did not take\r\nout an American register. This would be corroborative proof that, though\r\nbuilt in America, she was not meant to be, nor ever became, an American\r\nbottom; for I presume the register is what completes the American bottom.\r\nThe matter of fact should be proved to the collector.\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island Packets._\r\n\r\nThe pretension that the navigation from Newport to New York is entirely a\r\nnavigation of rivers, bays, and sounds, would take from language all kind\r\nof certainty. There is not one point of the coast of Rhode Island, from\r\nwhich a perpendicular line does not lead into the main ocean. A very small\r\nproportion of these would lead across Block Island. But to say that Block\r\nIsland covers the whole coast from Martha's Vineyard to Long Island, so\r\nas to make it a Sound, is too gross for any one who casts his eyes on the\r\nmaps. The difference of regulation, too, between bay-craft and coasting\r\nvessels, since the act of April 25th, is very inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 29, 1808.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson will thank General Dearborne to consider the enclosed.\r\nThe writer appears to have that sincere enthusiasm for his undertaking\r\nwhich will ensure success. The education of the common people around\r\nDetroit is a most desirable object, and the proposition of extending\r\ntheir views to the teaching the Indian boys and girls to read and write,\r\nagriculture and mechanic trades to the former, spinning and weaving to the\r\nlatter, may perhaps be acceded to by us advantageously for the Indians,\r\nand the bounties paid for them be an aid to the other objects of the\r\ninstitution. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nNotes on such parts of Fronda's letter of April 26th, 1808, as are worth\r\nanswering:--\r\n\r\nI. I know of no recent orders to Governor Claiborne as to the navigation\r\nof the Mississippi, Uberville, and Pontchartrain; he should specify them,\r\nbut he may be told that no order has ever been given contrary to the\r\nrights of Spain. These rights are, 1st, a treaty right that \"the ships\r\nof Spain coming directly from Spain or her colonies, loaded only _with\r\nthe produce_ or manufactures of Spain or her colonies, shall be admitted\r\nduring the space of twelve years in the ports of New Orleans, and in all\r\nother legal ports of entry within the ceded territory, in the same manner\r\nas the ships of the United States, &c.\" 2d. A right of innocent passage\r\nfrom the mouth of the Mississippi to 31° of latitude, exactly commensurate\r\nwith our right of innocent passage up the rivers of Florida to 31° of\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\nII. In answer to his question whether we consider Mobile among the ports\r\nof the United States, he may be told that so long as we consider the\r\nquestion whether the Perdido is not the eastern boundary of Louisiana, as\r\ncontinuing in a train of amicable proceedings for adjustment, so long that\r\npart only of the river Mobile, which is above 31° of latitude, will be\r\nconsidered among the ports of the United States, withholding the exercise\r\nof jurisdiction on our part within the disputed territory, on the general\r\nprinciple of letting things remain in _statu quo pendente lite_.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing else in this letter worth answering.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM LYMAN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 30, 1803.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 11th of July came to hand a little before\r\nthe meeting of Congress, and soon after I received the apparatus for\r\nstylographic writing, which you were so kind as to send me, for which I\r\npray you to receive my particular thanks.\r\n\r\nThe invention is certainly very ingenious, and while it compares\r\nadvantageously with all others in other circumstances, it has an\r\nunrivalled preference as being so much more profitable. I had never\r\nheard of the invention till your letter announced it, for these novelties\r\nreach us very late, which renders your attentions on the occasion more\r\nacceptable, and more entitled to the acknowledgments which I now tender.\r\nThe decrees and orders of the belligerent nations having amounted nearly\r\nto declarations that they would take our vessels wherever found. Congress\r\nthought it best in the first instance to break off all intercourse with\r\nthem. They adjourned on Monday last, having passed an act authorizing\r\nme to suspend the embargo whenever the belligerents should revoke their\r\ndecrees or orders as to us. The embargo must continue, therefore, till\r\nthey meet again in November, unless the measures of the belligerents\r\nshould change. When they meet again, if these decrees and orders still\r\ncontinue, the question which they will have to decide will be, whether\r\na continuance of the embargo or war will be preferable. In the meantime\r\ngreat advances are making in the establishment of manufactures. Those of\r\ncotton will, I think, be so far proceeded on, that we shall never again\r\nhave to recur to the importation of cotton goods for our own use. I tender\r\nyou my salutations, and the assurances of my great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL ARMSTRONG.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--A safe conveyance offering by a special messenger to Paris,\r\nI avail myself of it to bring up my arrears to my foreign correspondents.\r\nI give them the protection of your cover, but to save the trouble of your\r\nattention to their distribution, I give them an inner cover to Mr. Harden,\r\nwhose attentions heretofore have encouraged me to ask this favor of him.\r\nBut should he not be with you, I must pray you to open my packages to him,\r\nand have them distributed, as it is of importance that some of them should\r\nbe delivered without delay. I shall say nothing to you on the subject\r\nof our foreign relations, because you will get what is official on that\r\nsubject from Mr. Madison.\r\n\r\nDuring the present paroxysm of the insanity of Europe, we have thought it\r\nwisest to break off all intercourse with her. We shall, in the course of\r\nthis year, have all our seaports, of any note, put into a state of defence\r\nagainst naval attacks. Against great land armies we cannot attempt it\r\nbut by equal armies. For these we must depend on a classified militia,\r\nwhich will give us the service of the class from twenty to twenty-six,\r\nin the nature of conscripts, composing a body of about 250,000, to be\r\nspecially trained. This measure, attempted at a former session, was passed\r\nat the last, and might, I think, have been carried by a small majority.\r\nBut considering that great innovations should not be forced on a slender\r\nmajority, and seeing that the general opinion is sensibly rallying to\r\nit, it was thought better to let it lie over to the next session, when,\r\nI trust, it will be passed. Another measure has now twice failed, which I\r\nhave warmly urged, the immediate settlement by donation of lands, of such\r\na body of militia in the territories of Orleans and Mississippi, as will\r\nbe adequate to the defence of New Orleans. We are raising some regulars in\r\naddition to our present force, for garrisoning our seaports, and forming\r\na nucleus for the militia to gather to. There will be no question who is\r\nto be my successor. Of this be assured, whatever may be said by newspapers\r\nand private correspondences. Local considerations have been silenced by\r\nthose dictated by the continued difficulties of the times. One word of\r\nfriendly request: be more frequent and full in your communications with\r\nus. I salute you with great friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nMY VERY DEAR GENERAL,--A safe conveyance offering by a special messenger\r\nto Paris, Mr. Barnes has requested me to avail you of it, by sending a\r\nremittance of a thousand dollars, for which a draught is under cover. I\r\nshall not write to you on the subject of our foreign relations, because of\r\nthe dangers by sea and the dangers by land. During the present paroxysm\r\nof the insanity of Europe, we have thought it wisest to break off all\r\nintercourse with her. We shall, in the course of this year, have all our\r\nseaports of any note put into a state of defence against naval attacks.\r\nAgainst great land armies we cannot attempt it but by equal armies.\r\nFor these we must depend on a classified militia, which will give us\r\nthe service of the class from twenty to twenty-six, in the nature of\r\nconscripts, composing a body of about 250,000, to be specially trained.\r\nThis measure, attempted at a former session, was passed at the last, and\r\nmight, I think, have been carried by a small majority; but considering\r\nthat great innovations should not be forced on slender majorities, and\r\nseeing that the public opinion is sensibly rallying to it, it was thought\r\nbetter to let it lie over to the next session, when I trust it will be\r\npassed. Another measure has now twice failed, which I have warmly urged,\r\nthe immediate settlement by donation of lands of such a body of militia\r\nin the territories of Orleans and Mississippi, as will be adequate to the\r\ndefence of New Orleans. We are raising some regulars in addition to our\r\npresent force, for garrisoning our seaports, and forming a nucleus for the\r\nmilitia to gather to. There will be no question who is to be my successor.\r\nOf this be assured, whatever may be said by newspapers and private\r\ncorrespondences; local considerations have been silenced by those dictated\r\nby the continued difficulties of the times. I salute you with sincere and\r\nconstant friendship and great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                               May 3, 1808.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a petition from a woman (Mary Barnett) who complains that\r\nher son of thirteen years of age, is detained against her will in the\r\nnaval military service. Having never before received an application of the\r\nkind in that department, I know not what are the rules there. But in the\r\nland service we have had many cases of enlistments of infants, and there\r\nthe law is considered to be, and our practice in conformity, as follows:\r\nAn infant is considered as incapable of binding himself by enlistment,\r\nand may at any time be reclaimed by a parent, guardian, next friend, or\r\nmay quit of his own accord, on complaint from a parent, &c. We direct\r\nthe officer to inquire into the fact of infancy, and if he believes him\r\nunder age he discharges him. If he believes him of full age, we advise the\r\nparent, &c., that he may take out a Habeas Corpus, and have the fact tried\r\nbefore an impartial judge: if enlisted with the consent of the parent,\r\n&c., it must be by indentures as prescribed by law for an apprentice or\r\nservant, this being the only mode of obligation in which the law will\r\ncompel _specific_ execution. In case of a verbal or a common written\r\nsubscription of engagement, even with consent of the parent, _damages_\r\nonly can be recovered for withdrawing from it. I presume the rules in the\r\nNavy Department must be the same, as we must conform ourselves to the law\r\nin all departments. I directed the woman to call on me again to-morrow.\r\nWill you be so good as to enable me to give her an answer? Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR TOMPKINS.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 4, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I duly received your favor of April 18th, covering an Act of the\r\nlegislature of New York, appropriating $100,000 to aid and expedite the\r\ndefence of the city and port of New York, and $20,000 to aid in and\r\ncontribute to the defence of the northern and western frontiers, and\r\nexpressing a desire to receive an opinion on the application of those\r\nsums.\r\n\r\nIn carrying into execution the provisions of Congress, at their last\r\nsession, for fortifying on a just view of the relative importance of the\r\nplaces, combined with their degree of exposure, and capability of defence,\r\nand in such way as to require a moderate permanent force of regulars,\r\nrelying much, in case of sudden attack on the aid of the militia. Among\r\nthe objects of our care, New York stands foremost in the points of\r\nimportance and exposure; and, if permitted, we shall provide such defences\r\nfor it as, in our opinion, will render it secure against attacks by sea.\r\nThe particulars of what is proposed to be done can be made known to you by\r\nColonel Williams, as it is probable these may not comprehend everything\r\nwhich the anxieties of the citizens might think of service in their\r\ndefence. I suggest for your consideration, the idea of applying the fund\r\nappropriated to this object, by your legislature, to such supplementary\r\nprovisions as in your judgment might be necessary to render ours adequate\r\nto fulfil the views and confidence of your citizens. Of this however, you\r\nare the best judge. But I cannot omit to urge that no time should be lost\r\nin deciding on so much of the plan proposed by the Secretary at War, as\r\ndepends on a cession from the State authorities.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that it would be well to have a post on the Saint\r\nLawrence, as near our line as a commanding position could be found, that\r\nit might afford some cover for our most advanced inhabitants. But if a\r\nrupture takes place now, such a post would too soon lose all its value,\r\nto be worth building at this time. It is only in the event of a solid\r\naccommodation with Great Britain, and their retaining their present\r\npossessions, that it might become worthy of attention. I do not know\r\nthat the $20,000 appropriated by the State of New York, \"to aid in, and\r\ncontribute to, the defence of the northern and western frontiers,\" could\r\nbe better applied than as supplementary to our provisions in this quarter\r\nalso. We cannot, for instance, deliver out our arms to the militia, until\r\ncalled into the field. Yet it would be a great security had every militia\r\nman on these frontiers a good musket in his hands. However, here again\r\nyour Excellency is the best judge, and I have hazarded these ideas as to\r\nthe application of the appropriations, only on the wish you expressed that\r\nI would do it, and on my own desire to interchange ideas with frankness,\r\nand without reserve with those charged, in common with myself with the\r\npublic interests. I beg leave to tender you the assurances of my high\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\n                                                               May 5, 1808.\r\n\r\nGREAT AND GOOD FRIEND,--Having learnt the safe arrival of your Royal\r\nHighness at the city of Rio Janeiro, I perform with pleasure the duty of\r\noffering you my sincere congratulations by Mr. Hill, a respected citizen\r\nof the United States, who is specially charged with the delivery of this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nI trust that this event will be as propitious to the prosperity of\r\nyour faithful subjects as to the happiness of your Royal Highness, in\r\nwhich the United States of America have ever taken a lively interest.\r\nInhabitants now of the same land, of that great continent which the genius\r\nof Columbus has given to the world, the United States feel sensibly\r\nthat they stand in new and closer relations with your Royal Highness,\r\nand that the motives which heretofore nourished the friendly relations\r\nwhich have so happily prevailed, have acquired increased strength on the\r\ntransfer of your residence to their own shores. They see in prospect, a\r\nsystem of intercourse between the different regions of this hemisphere of\r\nwhich the peace and happiness of mankind may be the essential principle.\r\nTo this principle your long-tried adherence, for the benefit of those\r\nyou governed, in the midst of warring powers, is a pledge to the new\r\nworld that its peace, its free and friendly intercourse, will be your\r\nchief concern. On the part of the United States I assure you, that these\r\nwhich have hitherto been their ruling objects, will be most particularly\r\ncultivated with your Royal Highness and your subjects at Brazil, and they\r\nhope that that country so favored by the gifts of nature, now advanced to\r\na station under your immediate auspices, will find, in the interchange of\r\nmutual wants and supplies, the true aliment of an unchanging friendship\r\nwith the United States of America.\r\n\r\nI pray to God, great and good friend, that in your new abode you may enjoy\r\nhealth, happiness, and the affections of your people, and that He will\r\nalways have you in His safe and holy keeping.\r\n\r\nDone at Washington, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNORS OF NEW ORLEANS, GEORGIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, MASSACHUSETTS\r\nAND NEW HAMPSHIRE.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The evasions of the preceding embargo laws went so far towards\r\ndefeating their objects, and chiefly by vessels clearing out coast-wise,\r\nthat Congress, by their act of April 25th, authorized the absolute\r\ndetention of all vessels bound coast-wise with cargoes exciting suspicions\r\nof an intention to evade those laws. There being few towns on our\r\nsea-coast which cannot be supplied with flour from their interior country,\r\nshipments of flour become generally suspicious and proper subjects of\r\ndetention. Charleston is one of the few places on our seaboard which need\r\nsupplies of flour by sea for its own consumption. That it may not suffer\r\nby the cautions we are obliged to use, I request of your excellency,\r\nwhenever you deem it necessary that your present or any future stock\r\nshould be enlarged, to take the trouble of giving your certificate\r\nin favor of any merchant in whom you have confidence, directed to the\r\ncollector of any port, usually exporting flour, from which he may choose\r\nto bring it, for any quantity which you may deem necessary for consumption\r\nbeyond your interior supplies, enclosing to the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nat the same time a duplicate of the certificate as a check on the\r\nfalsification of your signature. In this way we may secure a supply of the\r\nreal wants of our citizens, and at the same time prevent those wants from\r\nbeing made a cover for the crimes against their country which unprincipled\r\nadventurers are in the habit of committing. I trust, too, that your\r\nexcellency will find an apology for the trouble I propose to give you, in\r\nthat desire which you must feel in common with all our worthy citizens,\r\nthat inconveniences encountered cheerfully by them for the interests of\r\ntheir country, shall not be turned merely to the unlawful profits of the\r\nmost worthless part of society. I salute your excellency with assurances\r\nof my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                               May 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nIn the outset of the business of detentions, I think it impossible to\r\nform precise rules. After a number of cases shall have arisen they may\r\nprobably be thrown into groups and subjected to rules. The great leading\r\nobject of the Legislature was, and ours in execution of it ought to be, to\r\ngive complete effect to the embargo laws. They have bidden agriculture,\r\ncommerce, navigation, to bow before that object, to be nothing when in\r\ncompetition with that. Finding all their endeavors at general rules to be\r\nevaded, they finally gave us the power of detention as the panacea, and I\r\nam clear we ought to use it freely that we may, by a fair experiment, know\r\nthe power of this great weapon, the embargo. Therefore, to propositions\r\nto carry flour into the Chesapeake, the Delaware, the Hudson, and other\r\n_exporting_ places, we should say boldly it is not wanted there for\r\nconsumption, and the carrying it there is too suspicious to be permitted.\r\nIn consequence of the letters to the Governors of the flour-importing\r\nStates, we may also say boldly that there being no application from the\r\nGovernor is a proof it is not wanting in those States, and therefore must\r\nnot be carried. As to shuffling of cotton, tobacco, flax seed, &c., from\r\none port to another, it may be some trifling advantage to individuals to\r\nchange their property out of one form into another, but it is not of a\r\nfarthing's benefit to the nation at large, and risks their great object\r\nin the embargo. The want of these at a particular place should be very\r\nnotorious to the collector and others, to take off suspicion of illicit\r\nintentions. Dry goods of Europe, coal, bricks, &c., are articles entirely\r\nwithout suspicion. I hazard these things for your consideration, and I\r\nsend you a copy of the letter to the Governors, which may be communicated\r\nin form to the collectors to strengthen the ground of suspicion. You will\r\nbe so good as to decide these cases yourself, without forwarding them to\r\nme. Whenever you are clear either way, so decide; where you are doubtful,\r\nconsider me as voting for detention, being satisfied that individuals\r\nought to yield their private interests to this great public object.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 12, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My journey and two days' detention on the road by high waters,\r\ngave me time to reflect on our canal at New Orleans, on which I will\r\ntherefore hazard some thoughts.\r\n\r\nI think it has been said that the Mississippi, at low water, is many\r\nfeet lower opposite New Orleans than Lake Pontchartrain. But the fact\r\nis impossible, being in contradiction to the laws of nature; two beds\r\nof dead water connected with the same ocean, in vicinity to one another,\r\nmust each be in the level of that ocean, and consequently of one another.\r\nAlthough Pontchartrain receives the Amite and some other small streams,\r\nthey probably do little more than supply its evaporation. No doubt,\r\nhowever, that the lake must receive the small ebb and flow of the sea.\r\nThe Mississippi, on the contrary, even at its lowest tide, always flows\r\ndownwards to and beyond its mouth; it must, then, at New Orleans, be\r\none, two, or three feet higher than the sea, and consequently than\r\nPontchartrain.\r\n\r\nIf a simple canal were cut from that of Carondelet to the Mississippi\r\nwithout lock or gate, there would be two risks. 1. That in high water of\r\nthe Mississippi the current would be too strong for a gun-boat to ascend\r\nor descend. This might perhaps be remedied by the draught of horses. 2.\r\nThe force of such a current, (unless the whole canal were lined with brick\r\nor masonry,) might convert the canal into a bay, one of an unknown size,\r\nand involve New Orleans in it.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I suspect our plan is pretty obvious: suppose we want\r\nsix feet water; make a canal of that depth below the lowest ebb of\r\nPontchartrain from the lake to where the lock is to be placed,--then bring\r\na canal from the river to the lock, the depth of which shall be six feet\r\nbelow the lowest water of the Mississippi ever known; at the back there\r\nwill be a descent, suppose of one, two or three feet, or any other number.\r\nThe lock remedies that. If the lock were near the lake it would lessen\r\nthe work by giving nearly the whole length to the shallowest canal, and\r\nit would probably be in a more tranquil and safe situation. But it might\r\nbe inconvenient, perhaps unsafe, to the sides of the Mississippi canal,\r\nto permit such a depth of water as would be in it, through its whole\r\nlength, at the time of the high water of that river. Of the best position,\r\ntherefore, of the lock, the superintendent must judge on the spot, as he\r\nmust indeed of the correctness of all the preceding conjectures, formed\r\nwithout a knowledge of the localities. They are hazarded merely to give us\r\nsome fixed notions of the nature of the enterprize, and are submitted to\r\nyour consideration. I salute you with affectionate respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday the enclosed letter from a Mr. Wood, of\r\nNew York. I should suppose the fruits of Europe stood nearly on the ground\r\nof the dry goods of Europe, not tempting evasion by exorbitant prices,\r\nnor defeating the object of the embargo in any important degree, even\r\nif a deviation should take place. I send it to yourself for decision and\r\nanswer, in order that there may be an uniformity in the decisions. I am\r\nreally glad to find the collector so cautious, and hope others will be\r\nequally so, and I place immense value in the experiment being fully made,\r\nhow far an embargo may be an effectual weapon in future as well as on this\r\noccasion. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. Will you send me sixteen copies of my letters to the Governors of\r\nOrleans, Georgia, &c., which I think you proposed to have printed? I will\r\nenclose it to the other governors with explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 17, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 16th came to hand last night. As the lead mines do\r\nnot press in point of time, I would rather they should be the subject of a\r\nconversation on my return. It is not merely a question about the terms we\r\nhave to consider, but the expediency of working them. As to the Savannah\r\nrevenue cutter, I approve of the proposition in your letter, or whatever\r\nelse you may think proper to be done. The regular traders to New Orleans\r\nmay be admitted to go as usual, the characters of the owners being known\r\nto be safe, and provisions and lumber being excepted. Cotton perhaps may\r\nbe permitted to be brought back on the consideration that its price in\r\nEurope is not likely to be such as that the adventurers may afford to pay\r\nall the forfeitures. I presume Mr. Price's application, which I enclose\r\nyou, will fall under this general permission. Will you be so good as to\r\nhave the proper answer given him. If we change our rule of tonnage for\r\nMr. Murray's purpose, the next application will be for such a rate of\r\ntonnage as will allow them to bring back their property in the form of\r\nhay. General Dearborne has occasion to send a vessel to Passamaquoddy with\r\ncannon for the batteries, and perhaps provision for the troops, and has\r\nasked me to send him a blank license. But as these licenses are not signed\r\nby me, I refer him to you for the necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\nI shall sincerely lament Cuba's falling into any hands but those of its\r\npresent owners. Spanish America is at present in the best hands for us,\r\nand \"Chi sta bene, non si muove\" should be our motto. I salute you with\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now return you the papers reserved from the last post. Our\r\nregular answer to Mr. Livingston may well be, that the Attorney General\r\nhaving given an official opinion that the right to the batture is in the\r\nUnited States, and the matter being now referred to Congress, it is our\r\nduty to keep the grounds clear of any adversary possession, until the\r\nLegislature shall decide on it. I have carefully read Mr. Livingston's\r\nprinted memoir. He has shaken my opinion as to the line within the road\r\nhaving been intended as a line of _boundary_ instead of its being a line\r\nof _admeasurement_ only. But he establishes another fact by the testimony\r\nof Fendeau, very fatal to his claim; to wit, that the high-water mark,\r\n\"batture, ou viennent _battre_ les eaux lorsqu elles sont dans leurs plus\r\ngrandes croissances,\" is the universal boundary of private grants on the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nYour observations on his allegations that Gravier's grant must be under\r\nthe Spanish law, because after the cession of the province by France to\r\nSpain, though before delivery of possession, are conclusive. To which may\r\nbe added, that Louis XIV. having established the Constumes de Paris as\r\nthe law of Louisiana, this was not changed by the mere act of transfer;\r\non the contrary, the laws of France continued and continue to be the law\r\nof the land, except where specially altered by some subsequent edict of\r\nSpain or act of Congress. He has not in the least shaken the doctrine\r\nthat the bed of the river, and all the atterrissements or banks which\r\narise on it by the depositions of the river, are the property of the King\r\nby a peculiarity in the law of France; so that nothing quoted from those\r\nof Spain or the Roman law is of authority on that point. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you the papers of Fanning, Lesdernier, and Sacket.\r\nWith respect to Fanning's case, the true key for the construction of\r\neverything doubtful in a law, is the intention of the law-makers. This is\r\nmost safely gathered from the words, but may be sought also in extraneous\r\ncircumstances, provided they do not contradict the express words of the\r\nlaw. We certainly know that the Legislature meant that vessels might\r\ngo out to bring home property, but not to commence a new career of\r\ncommerce. The bringing home the property being the main object, if it\r\nbe in an impracticable form, it expects the intention of the law to let\r\nit be commuted into a practicable form; and so from an inconvenient to a\r\nconvenient form. To prevent any abuse of this accommodation, by entering\r\ninto a new operation of commerce with it, the discretionary permission\r\nis left to the President. I think the conversion of the sandal wood into\r\na more portable form in this case, is fulfilling the object of the law,\r\nand that it is immaterial whether that be done in the Friendly Islands,\r\nwhere the wood now is, or wherever by the way it can be better done.\r\nConsequently, that permission may be granted. I hope you will spare no\r\npains or expense to bring the rascals of Passamaquoddy to justice, and if\r\nmore force be necessary, agree on the subject with General Dearborne or\r\nMr. Smith, as to any aid they can spare, and let it go without waiting\r\nto consult me. Let the successor to Sacket also be commissioned without\r\nwaiting for my opinion, which will be yours. Should a pardon be granted\r\nto Russell, I generally but not invariably require a recommendation from\r\nthe judges. I shall be ready to consider any propositions you may make for\r\nmitigating the embargo law of April 25th, but so only as not to defeat\r\nthe object of the law. I shall be ready to make a distinction between\r\nprovisions, timber, naval stores, and such things, as by the exaggerated\r\nprices they have got to in foreign markets, would enable infactors to pay\r\nall forfeitures and still make great profit, and cotton and such other\r\narticles as have not got to such prices. I am for going substantially to\r\nthe object of the law, and no further; perhaps a little more earnestly\r\nbecause it is the first expedient, and it is of great importance to know\r\nits full effect.\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 14th came to hand yesterday. I do not see that we\r\ncan avoid agreeing to estimates made by worthy men of our own choice for\r\nthe sites of fortifications, or that we could leave an important place\r\nundefended because too much is asked for the site. And therefore we must\r\npay what the sites at Boston have been valued at. At the same time I do\r\nnot know on what principles of reasoning it is that good men think the\r\npublic ought to pay more for a thing than they would themselves if they\r\nwanted it. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL BENJAMIN SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I return you my thanks for the communication by your letter of\r\nApril 19th, of the resolutions of the Grand Jury of Brunswick, approving\r\nof the embargo. Could the alternative of war or the embargo have been\r\npresented to the whole nation, as it occurred to their representatives,\r\nthere could have been but the one opinion that it was better to take the\r\nchance of one year by the embargo, within which the orders and decrees\r\nproducing it may be repealed, or peace take place in Europe, which\r\nmay secure peace to us. How long the continuance of the embargo may be\r\npreferable to war, is a question we shall have to meet, if the decrees\r\nand orders and war continue. I am sorry that in some places, chiefly on\r\nour northern frontier, a disposition even to oppose the law by force has\r\nbeen manifested. In no country on earth is this so impracticable as in\r\none where every man feels a vital interest in maintaining the authority\r\nof the laws, and instantly engages in it as in his own personal cause.\r\nAccordingly, we have experienced this spontaneous aid of our good citizens\r\nin the neighborhoods where there has been occasion, as I am persuaded we\r\never shall on such occasions. Through the body of our country generally\r\nour citizens appear heartily to approve and support the embargo. I am also\r\nto thank you for the communication of the Wilmington proceedings, and I\r\nadd my salutations and assurances of great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 24, 1807.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR;-- * * * * * What has been already said on the subject of Casa\r\nCalvo, Yrujo, Miranda, is sufficient, and that these should be seriously\r\nbrought up again argues extreme weakness in Cavallos, or a plan to keep\r\nthings unsettled with us. But I think it would not be amiss to take him\r\ndown from his high airs as to the right of the sovereign to hinder the\r\nupper inhabitants from the use of the Mobile, by observing, 1st, that\r\nwe claim to be the sovereign, although we give time for discussion. But\r\n2d, that the upper inhabitants of a navigable water have always a right\r\nof innocent passage along it. I think Cavallos will not probably be\r\nthe minister when the letter arrives at Madrid, and that an eye to that\r\ncircumstance may perhaps have some proper influence on the style of the\r\nletter, in which, if meant for himself, his hyperbolic airs might merit\r\nless respect. I think too that the truth as to Pike's mission might\r\nbe so simply stated as to need no argument to show that (even during\r\nthe suspension of our claims to the eastern border of the Rio Norte)\r\nhis getting on it was mere error, which ought to have called for the\r\nsetting him right, instead of forcing him through the interior country.\r\n[Sullivan's letter.] His view of things for some time past has been\r\nentirely distempered.\r\n\r\nCathcart's, Ridgeley's, Navour's, Degen's, Appleton's, Lee's, and Baker's\r\nletters, are all returned. I salute you with great affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 25, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--There is a subject on which I wished to speak with you before\r\nI left Washington; but an apt occasion did not occur. It is that of your\r\ncontinuance in office. Perhaps it is as well to submit my thoughts to you\r\nby letter. The present summer is too important in point of preparation, to\r\nleave your department unfilled, for any time, as I once thought might be\r\ndone; and it would be with extreme reluctance that, so near the time of\r\nmy own retirement, I should proceed to name any high officer, especially\r\none who must be of the intimate councils of my successor, and who ought\r\nof course to be in his unreserved confidence. I think too it would make\r\nan honorable close of your term as well as mine, to leave our country in\r\na state of substantial defence, which we found quite unprepared for it.\r\nIndeed, it would for me be a joyful annunciation to the next meeting of\r\nCongress, that the operations of defence are all complete. I know that\r\nNew York must be an exception; but perhaps even that may be closed before\r\nthe 4th of March, when you and I might both make our bow with approbation\r\nand satisfaction. Nor should I suppose that under present circumstances,\r\nanything interesting in your future office could make it important for\r\nyou to repair to its immediate occupation. In February my successor will\r\nbe declared, and may then, without reserve, say whom he would wish me\r\nto nominate to the Senate in your place. I submit these circumstances to\r\nyour consideration, and wishing in all things to consult your interests,\r\nyour fame and feelings, it will give me sincere joy to learn that you will\r\n\"watch with me to the end.\" I salute you with great affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LIEPER.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 25, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your favor of April 22d a little before I was to\r\nleave Washington, much engaged with despatching the business rendered\r\nnecessary by the acts of Congress just risen, and preparatory to a short\r\nvisit to this place. Here again I have been engrossed with some attentions\r\nto my own affairs, after a long absence, added to the public business\r\nwhich presses on me here as at Washington. I mention these things to\r\napologize for the long delay of an answer to the address of the Democratic\r\nrepublicans of Philadelphia, enclosed in your letter, and which has\r\nremained longer unanswered than I wished. I have been happy in my journey\r\nthrough the country to this place, to find the people unanimous in their\r\npreference of the embargo to war, and the great sacrifice they make,\r\nrendered a cheerful one from a sense of its necessity.\r\n\r\nWhether the pressure on the throne from the suffering people of England,\r\nand of their Islands, the conviction of the dishonorable as well as\r\ndishonest character of their orders of council, the strength of their\r\nparliamentary opposition, and remarkable weakness of the defence of their\r\nministry, will produce a repeal of these orders and cessation of our\r\nembargo, is yet to be seen. To nobody will a repeal be so welcome as to\r\nmyself. Give us peace till our revenues are liberated from debt, and then,\r\nif war be necessary, it can be carried on without a new tax or loan, and\r\nduring peace we may chequer our whole country with canals, roads, &c. This\r\nis the object to which all our endeavors should be directed. I salute you\r\nwith great friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday yours of the 23d, and now return you\r\nWoolsey's and Astor's letters. I send you one also which I have received\r\nfrom a Mr. Thorne, on the evasions of the embargo on Lake Champlain. The\r\nconduct of some of our officers there, and of some excellent citizens,\r\nhas been very meritorious, and I will thank you to express any degree\r\nof approbation you think proper, in my name, for Captain Mayo. Woolsey\r\nappears also to deserve assurances of approbation. If you think Thorne's\r\nsuggestion of some militia at Point au Fer necessary and proper, be so\r\ngood as to consult General Dearborne, who will give any order you and he\r\napprove. With respect to the coasting trade, my wish is only to carry into\r\nfull effect the intentions of the embargo laws. I do not wish a single\r\ncitizen in any of the States to be deprived of a meal of bread, but I\r\nset down the exercise of commerce, merely for profit, as nothing when\r\nit carries with it the danger of defeating the objects of the embargo.\r\nI have more faith, too, in the Governors. I cannot think that any one of\r\nthem would wink at abuses of that law. Still, I like your circular of the\r\n20th, and the idea there brought forward of confining the shipment to so\r\nsmall a proportion of the bond as may correspond with the exaggeration of\r\nprice and foreign markets, and thus restrain the adventurer from gaining\r\nmore than he would lose by dishonesty. Flour, by the latest accounts, I\r\nhave observed, sold at about eight times its cost here, while the legal\r\npenalties are but about three prices--by restraining them to an eighth\r\nthey will be balanced. But as prices rise must not our rules be varied?\r\nHad the practicability of this mode of restraint occurred before the\r\nrecurrence to the Governors, I should have preferred it, because it is\r\nfree from the objection of favoritism to which the Governors will be\r\nexposed, and if you find it work well in practice, we may find means to\r\nhave the other course discontinued. Our course should be to sacrifice\r\neverything to secure the effect of the law, and nothing beyond that.\r\n\r\nI enclose you an application of Neilson & Son, to which you will please to\r\nhave given whatever answer is conformable to general rules. The petition\r\nof Gardner and others, masters of the Rhode Island packet ships, which\r\nI enclose you, does not specify the particular act required from us for\r\ntheir relief. If it be to declare that the open sea in front of their\r\ncoast is a bay or a river, the matter of fact, as well as the law, renders\r\nthat impossible. I really think it desirable to relieve their case, in\r\nany way which is lawful, because it is one, which though embraced by the\r\nwords of the law, is not within its object. You mention that a principal\r\nmethod of evading the embargo is by loading secretly and going off without\r\nclearance. The naval department must aid us against this. As I shall\r\nleave this for Washington in about ten or twelve days, I now desire the\r\npost-office there to send no letters to this place after receiving this\r\nnotice. All further matters relative to the embargo will therefore be\r\nanswered verbally as soon as they could by letter. I salute you with great\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOWDOIN.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 29, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received the favor of your letter, written soon after your\r\narrival, a little before I left Washington, and during a press of business\r\npreparatory to my departure on a short visit to this place; this has\r\nprevented my earlier congratulations to you on your safe return to your\r\nown country. There, judging from my own experience, you will enjoy much\r\nmore of the tranquil happiness of life, than is to be found in the noisy\r\nscenes of the great cities of Europe. I am also aware that you had at\r\nParis additional causes of disquietude; these seem inseparable from public\r\nlife, and, indeed, are the greatest discouragements to entering into or\r\ncontinuing in it. Perhaps, however, they sweeten the hour of retirement,\r\nand secure us from all dangers of regret. On the subject of that\r\ndisquietude, it is proper for me only to say that, however unfortunate the\r\nincident, I found in it no cause of dissatisfaction with yourself, nor of\r\nlessening the esteem I entertain for your virtues and talents; and, had\r\nit not been disagreeable to yourself, I should have been well pleased that\r\nyou could have proceeded on your original destination.\r\n\r\nWhile I thank you for the several letters received from you during your\r\nabsence, I have to regret the miscarriage of some of those I wrote you.\r\nNot having my papers here, I cannot cite their dates by memory; but they\r\nshall be the subject of another letter on my return to Washington.\r\n\r\nYou find us on your return in a crisis of great difficulty. An embargo\r\nhad, by the course of events, become the only peaceable card we had to\r\nplay. Should neither peace, nor a revocation of the decrees and orders in\r\nEurope take place, the day cannot be distant when that will cease to be\r\npreferable to open hostility. Nothing just or temperate has been omitted\r\non our part, to retard or to avoid this unprofitable alternative. Our\r\nsituation will be the more singular, as we may have to choose between two\r\nenemies, who have both furnished cause of war. With one of them we could\r\nnever come into contact; with the other great injuries may be mutually\r\ninflicted and received. Let us still hope to avoid, while we prepare to\r\nmeet them.\r\n\r\nHoping you will find our cloudless skies and benign climate more favorable\r\nto your health than those of Europe, I pray you to accept my friendly\r\nsalutations, and assurances of great esteem and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 31, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you all the papers received from you by yesterday's\r\nmail, except Mr. Burnley's, which I shall send by the Secretary at\r\nWar. Although all the appointments below field-officers are made, it is\r\npossible some may decline, and open a way for new competition. I have\r\nobserved that Turreau's letters have for some time past changed their\r\nstyle unfavorably. I believe this is the first occasion he has had to\r\ncomplain of French deserters being enlisted by us, and if so, the tone\r\nof his application is improper. The answer to him, however, is obvious as\r\nto our laws and instructions, and the _discharge_, not _delivery_, of the\r\nmen, for which purpose I presume you will write a line to the Secretary at\r\nWar. Woodward's scruples are perplexing. And they are unfounded, because,\r\non his own principle, if a law requires an oath to be administered, and\r\ndoes not say by whom, he admits it may be any judge; if, therefore, it\r\nnames a person no longer in existence, it is as if it named nobody.\r\nOn this construction all the territories have practised, and all the\r\nauthorities of the national government,--even the Legislature. It was\r\nwrong on a second ground; no judge ever refusing to administer an oath in\r\nany useful case, although he may not consider it as strictly judicial.\r\nIf it may be valid or useful, he administers \"_ut valeat quantum valer\r\npotest_.\" But what is to be done? Would it not be well for you to send\r\nthe case to the Attorney General, and get him to enclose his opinion to\r\nGovernor Hull, who will use it with Judge Witherall, or some territorial\r\njudge or justice?\r\n\r\nWith the quarrel of Judge Vandeberg and his bar we cannot intermeddle.\r\nMercer's querulous letter is an unreasonable one. How could his offer of\r\nservice be acted on, but by putting it in the hands of those who were to\r\nact on all others?\r\n\r\nI shall to-day direct the post-rider not to continue his route to this\r\nplace after to-day, and to take your orders as to the time you would wish\r\nhim to continue coming to you. I salute you with affectionate esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have considered the letter of the director of the mint, stating\r\nthe ease with which the errors of Commodore Truxton's medal may be\r\ncorrected on the medal itself, and the unpracticability of doing it on\r\nthe die. In my former letter to you on this subject, I observed that to\r\nmake a new die would be a serious thing, requiring consideration. In fact,\r\nthe first die having been made by authority of the Legislature, the medal\r\nstruck, accepted, and acquiesced in for so many years, the powers given by\r\nthat law are executed and at an end, and a second law would be requisite\r\nto make a second die or medal. But I presume it will be quite as agreeable\r\nto Commodore Truxton to have his medal corrected in one way as another,\r\nif done equally well, and it certainly may be as well or better done by\r\nthe graver, and with more delicate traits. I remember it was the opinion\r\nof Doctor Franklin that where only one or a few medals were to be made, it\r\nwas better to have them engraved.\r\n\r\nThe medal being corrected, the die becomes immaterial. That has never been\r\ndelivered to the party, the medal itself being the only thing voted to\r\nhim. I say this on certain grounds, because I think this and Preble's are\r\nthe only medals given by the United States which have not been made under\r\nmy immediate direction. The dies of all those given by the old Congress,\r\nand made at Paris, remain to this day deposited with our bankers at Paris.\r\nThat of General Lee, made in Philadelphia, was retained in the mint. I\r\nmention this not as of consequence whether the die be given or retained,\r\nbut to show that there can be no claim of the party to it, or consequently\r\nto its correction. I think, therefore, the medal itself should be\r\ncorrected by Mr. Reich; that this is as far as we can stretch our\r\nauthority, and I hope it will be satisfactory to the Commodore. I salute\r\nyou with constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SHELTON GILLIAM, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 4th was received on my return to this place, and\r\nthe proposition of your correspondent on the subject of fortification\r\nwas referred to the Secretary at War, where office and qualifications\r\nmake him the proper judge of it. I enclose you his answer. The same\r\nprudence which in private life would forbid our paying our own money\r\nfor unexplained projects, forbids it in the dispensation of the public\r\nmoneys. It is not enough that an individual and an unknown one says and\r\neven thinks he has made a discovery of the magnitude announced on this\r\noccasion. Not only explanation, but the actual experiment must be required\r\nbefore we can cease to doubt whether the inventor is not deceived by some\r\nfalse or imperfect view of his subject. Still your patriotic attention\r\nto bring such a proposition under our notice, that it might be applied to\r\nthe public good, if susceptible of it, is praiseworthy, and I return you\r\nthanks for it with the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHRISTOPHER COLLES.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I thank you for the pamphlet containing your ideas on the subject of\r\ncanals constructed of wood; but it is not in my power to give any definite\r\nopinion of its national importance. If there exists a cement which used as\r\na lining for cisterns and aqueducts, renders them impermeable to water,\r\n(and it is affirmed that in France they are in the possession and use of\r\nsuch an one,) then it becomes the common question whether constructions of\r\nwood, brick, or rough stone are cheapest in the end? A question on which\r\nevery man possesses materials for forming his judgment. I suspect it is\r\nthe supposed necessity of using hewn stone in works of this kind which has\r\nhad the greatest effect in discouraging their being undertaken. I tender\r\nyou my salutations and respects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES PEMBERTON.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 21, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of May 30th was delivered me on my return to this\r\nplace, and I now enclose the prospectus of Clarkson's history with my\r\nsubscription to it. I have perused with great satisfaction the Report\r\nof the Committee for the African institution. The sentiments it breathes\r\nare worthy of the eminent characters who compose the institution, as are\r\nalso the generous cares they propose to undertake. I wish they may begin\r\ntheir work at the right end. Our experience with the Indians has proved\r\nthat letters are not the first, but the last step in the progression\r\nfrom barbarism to civilization. Our Indian neighbors will occupy all the\r\nattentions we may spare, towards the improvement of their condition. The\r\nfour great Southern tribes are advancing hopefully. The foremost are\r\nthe Cherokees, the upper settlements of whom have made to me a formal\r\napplication to be received into the Union as citizens of the United\r\nStates, and to be governed by our laws. If we can form for them a simple\r\nand acceptable plan of advancing by degrees to a maturity for receiving\r\nour laws, the example will have a powerful effect towards stimulating\r\nthe other tribes in the same progression, and will cheer the gloomy views\r\nwhich have overspread their minds as to their own future history. I salute\r\nyou with friendship and great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, June 22d, 1808.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson returns his thanks to Mr. Franklin for the address to the\r\nSociety of Friends which he was so kind as to send him. The appeal both to\r\nfacts and principles is strong, and their consistency will require an able\r\nadvocate. Conscious that the present administration has been essentially\r\npacific, and that in all questions of importance it has been governed by\r\nthe identical principles professed by that Society, it has been quite at\r\na loss to conjecture the unknown cause of the opposition of the greater\r\npart, and bare neutrality of the rest. The hope however that prejudices\r\nwould at length give way to facts, has never been entirely extinguished,\r\nand still may be realized in favor of another administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR LEIB.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 23, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor covering a copy of the talk to the\r\nTammany society, for which I thank you, and particularly for the favorable\r\nsentiments expressed towards myself. Certainly, nothing will so much\r\nsweeten the tranquillity and comfort of retirement, as the knowledge that\r\nI carry with me the good will and approbation of my republican fellow\r\ncitizens, and especially of the individuals in unison with whom I have so\r\nlong acted. With respect to the federalists, I believe we think alike; for\r\nwhen speaking of them, we never mean to include a worthy portion of our\r\nfellow citizens, who consider themselves as in duty bound to support the\r\nconstituted authorities of every branch, and to reserve their opposition\r\nto the period of election. These having acquired the appellation of\r\nfederalists, while a federal administration was in place, have not cared\r\nabout throwing off their name, but adhering to their principle, are\r\nthe supporters of the present order of things. The other branch of the\r\nfederalists, those who are so in principle as well as in name, disapprove\r\nof the republican principles and features of our Constitution, and would,\r\nI believe, welcome any public calamity (war with England excepted) which\r\nmight lessen the confidence of our country in those principles and forms.\r\nI have generally considered them rather as subjects for a mad-house. But\r\nthey are now playing a game of the most mischievous tendency, without\r\nperhaps being themselves aware of it. They are endeavoring to convince\r\nEngland that we suffer more by the embargo than they do, and if they will\r\nbut hold out awhile, we must abandon it. It is true, the time will come\r\nwhen we must abandon it. But if this is before the repeal of the orders\r\nof council, we must abandon it only for a state of war. The day is not\r\ndistant, when that will be preferable to a longer continuance of the\r\nembargo. But we can never remove that, and let our vessels go out and be\r\ntaken under these orders, without making reprisal. Yet this is the very\r\nstate of things which these federal monarchists are endeavoring to bring\r\nabout; and in this it is but too possible they may succeed. But the fact\r\nis, that if we have war with England, it will be solely produced by their\r\nmanœuvres. I think that in two or three months we shall know what will be\r\nthe issue.\r\n\r\nI salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                             June 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his compliments to General Wilkinson, and in\r\nanswer to his letters of yesterday observes that during the course of the\r\nBurr conspiracy, the voluminous communications he received were generally\r\nread but once and then committed to the Attorney General, and were never\r\nreturned to him. It is not in his power, therefore, to say that General\r\nWilkinson did or did not denounce eminent persons to him, and still less\r\nwho they were. It was unavoidable that he should from time to time mention\r\npersons known or supposed to be accomplices of Burr, and it is recollected\r\nthat some of these suspicions were corrected afterwards on better\r\ninformation. Whether the undefined term _denunciation_ goes to cases of\r\nthis kind or not Thomas Jefferson does not know, nor could he now name\r\nfrom recollection the persons suspected at different times. He salutes\r\nGeneral Wilkinson respectfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL D. C. BRENT.\r\n\r\n                                                             June 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The information given to me by Mrs. Paradise of letters to\r\nme from her grandsons, is without foundation. I have not for many years\r\nheard a tittle respecting the family at Venice. Should any information\r\nrespecting them come to me I will certainly communicate it to Mrs.\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\nThat the embargo is approved by the body of republicans through the Union,\r\ncannot be doubted. It is equally known that a great proportion of the\r\nfederalists approve of it; but as they think it an engine which may be\r\nused advantageously against the republican system, they countenance the\r\nclamors against it. I salute you with great friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                              July 4, 1808.\r\n\r\nGeneral Turreau's application for two vessels to carry French subjects to\r\nFrance, must, I think, be granted, because under present circumstances we\r\nought not on slight grounds to dissatisfy either belligerent. The vessels\r\nmay be back before winter, and their only danger will be of stoppage\r\nby the English, who, however, have no right but to take out the French\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I think it would be well to say to General Turreau\r\nthat we reluctantly let our seamen be exposed to capture, or perhaps\r\nto a voluntary engagement with one of the belligerents: that we rely,\r\ntherefore, on his so proportioning the vessels to the number of passengers\r\nas merely to give them a reasonable accommodation. It would be well, too,\r\nthat he should inform us after their departure, of the number of persons\r\nsent in them.\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have lately seen a printed report of the committee of the Canal\r\ncompany of New Orleans, stating the progress and prospects of their\r\nenterprize. In this the United States feel a strong interest, inasmuch\r\nas it will so much facilitate the passage of our armed vessels out of\r\nthe one water into the other. For this purpose, however, there must be at\r\nleast five and a half feet water through the whole line of communication\r\nfrom the lake to the river. In some conversations with Mr. Clark on this\r\nsubject the winter before last, there was a mutual understanding that\r\nthe company would complete the canal, and the United States would make\r\nthe locks. This we are still disposed to do; and so anxious are we to get\r\nthis means of defence completed, that to hasten it we would contribute any\r\nother encouragement within the limits of our authority which might produce\r\nthis effect. If, for instance, the completion of it within one year could\r\nbe insured by our contributing such a sum as one or two thousand dollars a\r\nmonth to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, in the whole, we might do\r\nit, requiring as a consideration for our justification that the vessels of\r\nthe United States should always pass toll-free. The object of this letter\r\nis to sound the principal members, without letting them know you do it\r\nby instruction from us, and to find out what moderate and reasonable aid\r\non our part would be necessary to get a speedy conclusion of the work,\r\nand in what form that aid would be most useful, and to be so good as to\r\ncommunicate it to me as soon as the knowledge is obtained by yourself.\r\nI should be glad to learn, at the same time, what is the perpendicular\r\nheight of the top of the levee above the surface of the water in the\r\nMississippi in its lowest state. Five and a half feet below this would\r\nbe indispensable for our purposes. I salute you with great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                             July 12, 1808.\r\n\r\n1. (Peyton Skipwith's letter.) I approve of the proposition to authorize\r\nthe collector of St. Mary's or Savannah to permit vessels to bring to\r\nSt. Mary's such supplies as in his opinion are really wanted for the\r\nindividuals applying, and where he has entire confidence no fraud will be\r\ncommitted. But the vessels should be reasonably proportioned to the cargo.\r\nShould this be extended to Passamaquoddy?\r\n\r\n2. (The cases of detention by Gelston and Turner.) The Legislature\r\nfinding that no general rules could be formed which would not be evaded by\r\navarice and roguery, finally authorized the collector, if there were still\r\ncircumstances of suspicion, to detain the vessel. Wherever, therefore, the\r\ncollector is impressed with suspicion, from a view of all circumstances,\r\nwhich are often indescribable, I think it proper to confirm his detention.\r\nIt would be only where, from his own showing, or other good information,\r\nprejudice or false views biassed his judgment, that I should be disposed\r\nto countermand his detention.\r\n\r\n3. The declaration of the bakers of New York, that their citizens will\r\nbe dissatisfied, under the present circumstances of their country, to eat\r\nbread of the flour of their own State, is equally a libel on the produce\r\nand citizens of the State. The citizens have certainly a right to speak\r\nfor themselves on such occasions, and when they do we shall be able to\r\njudge whether their numbers or characters are such as to be entitled to a\r\nsacrifice of the embargo law. If this prevails, the next application will\r\nbe for vessels to go to New York for the pippins of that State, because\r\nthey are higher flavored than the same species of apples growing in other\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n4. We should by all means appoint a new collector at Sackett's Harbor. If\r\nthe Governor knows nobody there who can be depended on, can he not find\r\nsome faithful man in the city or country who would consider the emoluments\r\nacceptable, such as they are?\r\n\r\n5. The seizure by Mr. Illsley not being under the embargo law, will take\r\nits course. With respect to the aid of gun-boats, desired by him and\r\nMr. Holmes of Sunbury, or any military aid, that can always be settled\r\ndirectly between Mr. Gallatin and the Secretaries of the Navy or War.\r\nBoth those gentlemen know our extreme anxiety to give a full effect to\r\nthe important experiment of the embargo, at any expense within the bounds\r\nof reason, and will, on the application of Mr. Gallatin, yield the aid of\r\ntheir departments without waiting the delay of consulting me.\r\n\r\nI have gone a little into the grounds of these opinions, in order that\r\nthere being a mutual understanding on these subjects, Mr. Gallatin during\r\nthe time of our separation may decide on the cases occurring, without\r\nthe delay of consulting me at such a distance. My principle is that the\r\nconveniences of our citizens shall yield reasonably, and their taste\r\ngreatly to the importance of giving the present experiment so fair a trial\r\nthat on future occasions our legislators may know with certainty how far\r\nthey may count on it as an engine for national purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA CAPEDE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 14, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--If my recollection does not deceive me, the collection of the\r\nremains of the animal incognitum of the Ohio (sometimes called mammoth),\r\npossessed by the Cabinet of Natural History at Paris, is not very copious.\r\nUnder this impression, and presuming that this Cabinet is allied to the\r\nNational Institute, to which I am desirous of rendering some service, I\r\nhave lately availed myself of an opportunity of collecting some of those\r\nremains. General Clarke (the companion of Governor Lewis in his expedition\r\nto the Pacific Ocean) being, on a late journey, to pass by the Big-bone\r\nLick of the Ohio, was kind enough to undertake to employ for me a number\r\nof laborers, and to direct their operations in digging for these bones\r\nat this important deposit of them. The result of these researches will\r\nappear in the enclosed catalogue of specimens which I am now able to place\r\nat the disposal of the National Institute. An aviso being to leave this\r\nplace for some port of France on public service, I deliver the packages\r\nto Captain Haley, to be deposited with the Consul of the United States,\r\nat whatever port he may land. They are addressed to Mr. Warden of our\r\nlegation at Paris, for the National Institute, and he will have the honor\r\nof delivering them. To these I have added the horns of an animal called\r\nby the natives the Mountain Ram, resembling the sheep by his head, but\r\nmore nearly the deer in his other parts; as also the skin of another\r\nanimal, resembling the sheep by his fleece but the goat in his other\r\nparts. This is called by the natives the Fleecy Goat, or in the style of\r\nthe natural historian, the Pokotragos. I suspect it to be nearly related\r\nto the Pacos, and were we to group the fleecy animals together, it would\r\nstand perhaps with the Vigogne, Pacos, and Sheep. The Mountain Ram was\r\nfound in abundance by Messrs. Lewis and Clarke on their western tour,\r\nand was frequently an article of food for their party, and esteemed more\r\ndelicate than the deer. The Fleecy Goat they did not see, but procured\r\ntwo skins from the Indians, of which this is one. Their description will\r\nbe given in the work of Governor Lewis, the journal and geographical part\r\nof which may be soon expected from the press; but the parts relating\r\nto the plants and animals observed in his tour, will be delayed by the\r\nengravings. In the meantime, the plants of which he brought seeds, have\r\nbeen very successfully raised in the botanical garden of Mr. Hamilton\r\nof the Woodlands, and by Mr. McMahon, a gardener of Philadelphia; and\r\non the whole, it is with pleasure I can assure you that the addition to\r\nour knowledge in every department, resulting from this tour of Messrs.\r\nLewis and Clarke, has entirely fulfilled my expectations in setting it on\r\nfoot, and that the world will find that those travellers have well earned\r\nits favor. I will take care that the Institute as well as yourself shall\r\nreceive Governor Lewis's work as it appears.\r\n\r\nIt is with pleasure I embrace this occasion of returning you my thanks for\r\nthe favor of your very valuable works, _sur les poissons et les cetacées_,\r\nwhich you were so kind as to send me through Mr. Livingston and General\r\nTurreau, and which I find entirely worthy of your high reputation in\r\nthe literary world. That I have not sooner made this acknowledgment has\r\nnot proceeded from any want of respect and attachment to yourself, or a\r\njust value of your estimable present, but from the strong and incessant\r\ncalls of duty to other objects. The candor of your character gives me\r\nconfidence of your indulgence on this head, and I assure you with truth\r\nthat no circumstances are more welcome to me than those which give me the\r\noccasion of recalling myself to your recollection, and of renewing to you\r\nthe assurances of sincere personal attachment, and of great respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n_Contents of the large square Box._\r\n\r\nA Fibia.\r\n\r\nA Radius.\r\n\r\nTwo ribs belonging to the upper part of the thorax.\r\n\r\nTwo ribs from a lower part of the thorax.\r\n\r\nOne entire vertebra.\r\n\r\nTwo spinous processes of the vertebra broken from the bodies.\r\n\r\nDentes molares, which appear to have belonged to the full-grown animal.\r\n\r\nA portion of the under-jaw of a young animal with two molar teeth in it.\r\n\r\nThese teeth appear to have belonged to a first set, as they are small, and\r\nthe posterior has but three grinding ridges, instead of five, the common\r\nnumber in adult teeth of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nAnother portion of the under-jaw, including the symphisis, or chin. In\r\nthis portion the teeth of one side are every way complete; to wit, the\r\nposterior has five transverse ridges, and the anterior three.\r\n\r\nA fragment of the upper-jaw with one molar tooth much worn.\r\n\r\nMolar teeth which we suppose to be like those of the mammoth or elephant\r\nof Siberia. They are essentially different from those of the mammoth\r\nor elephant of this country, and although similar in some respects to\r\nthe teeth of the Asiatic elephant, they agree more completely with the\r\ndescription of the teeth found in Siberia in the arrangement and size of\r\nthe transverse lamina of enamel. This idea, however, is not derived from\r\nactual comparison of the different teeth with each other, for we have no\r\nspecimens of Siberian teeth in this country; but from inferences deduced\r\nfrom the various accounts and drawings of these teeth to be found in\r\nbooks. A few of these teeth have been found in several places where the\r\nbones of the American animal have existed.\r\n\r\nAn Astragalus.\r\n\r\nAn Oscalcis.\r\n\r\nOs naviculare.\r\n\r\nIn the large box in which the preceding bones are, is a small one\r\ncontaining a promiscuous mass of small bones, chiefly of the feet.\r\n\r\nIn the large irregular-shaped box, a tusk of large size. The spiral twist\r\nin all the specimens of these tusks which we have seen, was remarked\r\nso long ago as the time of Breyneus, in his description of the tusks of\r\nthe Siberian mammoth in the Philosophical Transactions, if that paper is\r\nrightly recollected, for the book is not here to be turned to at present.\r\nMany fragments of tusks have been sent from the Ohio, generally resembling\r\nportions of such tusks as are brought to us in the course of commerce.\r\nBut of these spiral tusks, in a tolerable complete state, we have had only\r\nfour. One was found near the head of the north branch of the Susquehanna.\r\nA second possessed by Mr. Peale, was found with the skeleton, near the\r\nHudson. A third is at Monticello, found with the bones of this collection\r\nat the Big-bone lick of Ohio, and the fourth is that now sent for the\r\nInstitute, found at the same place and larger than that at Monticello.\r\n\r\nThe smallest box contains the horns of the mountain ram, and skin of the\r\nfleecy goat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SYLVESTRE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I had received from you on a former occasion the four first volumes\r\nof the Memoirs of the Agricultural Society of the Seine, and since that,\r\nyour letter of September 19th, with the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th volumes,\r\nbeing for the years 1804 '5 '6 with some separate memoirs. These I have\r\nread with great avidity and satisfaction, and now return you my thanks for\r\nthem. But I owe particular acknowledgments for the valuable present of the\r\nTheatre de De Serres, which I consider as a prodigy for the age in which\r\nit was composed, and shows an advancement in the science of agriculture\r\nwhich I had never suspected to have belonged to that time. Brought down\r\nto the present day by the very valuable notes added, it is really such a\r\ntreasure of agricultural knowledge, as has not before been offered to the\r\nworld in a single work.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely for myself, but for my country, that I must do homage\r\nto the philanthropy of the Society, which has dictated their destination\r\nfor me of their newly-improved plough. I shall certainly so use it as to\r\nanswer their liberal views, by making the opportunities of profiting by it\r\nas general as possible.\r\n\r\nI have just received information that a plough addressed to me has\r\narrived at New York, _from England_, but unaccompanied by any letter or\r\nother explanation. As I have had no intimation of such an article to be\r\nforwarded to me from that country, I presume it is the one sent by the\r\nSociety of the Seine, that it has been carried into England under their\r\norders of council, and permitted to come on from thence. This I shall\r\nknow within a short time. I shall with great pleasure attend to the\r\nconstruction and transmission to the Society of a plough with my mould\r\nboard. This is the only part of that useful instrument to which I have\r\npaid any particular attention. But knowing how much the perfection of the\r\nplough must depend, 1st, on the line of traction; 2d, on the direction\r\nof the share; 3d, on the angle of the wing; 4th, on the form of the\r\nmould-board; and persuaded that I shall find the three first advantages\r\neminently exemplified in that which the Society sends me, I am anxious\r\nto see combined with these a mould-board of my form, in the hope it will\r\nstill advance the perfection of that machine. But for this I must ask\r\ntime till I am relieved from the cares which have now a right to all my\r\ntime, that is to say, till the next Spring. Then giving, in the leisure\r\nof retirement, all the time and attention this construction merits and\r\nrequires, I will certainly render to the Society the result in a plough\r\nof the best form I shall be able to have executed. In the meantime, accept\r\nfor them and yourself the assurances of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LASTEYRIE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of March 28th, and with it your\r\ntreatises on the culture of the sugar cane and cotton plant in France.\r\nThe introduction of new cultures, and especially of objects of leading\r\nimportance to our comfort, is certainly worthy the attention of every\r\ngovernment, and nothing short of the actual experiment should discourage\r\nan essay of which any hope can be entertained. Till that is made, the\r\nresult is open to conjecture; and I should certainly conjecture that the\r\nsugar cane could never become an article of profitable culture in France.\r\nWe have within the ancient limits of the United States, a great extent of\r\ncountry which brings the orange to advantage, but not a foot in which the\r\nsugar cane can be matured. France, within its former limits, has but two\r\nsmall spots, (Olivreles and Hieres) which brings the orange in open air,\r\nand _à fortiori_, therefore, none proper for the cane. I should think the\r\nsugar-maple more worthy of experiment. There is no part of France of which\r\nthe climate would not admit this tree. I have never seen a reason why\r\nevery farmer should not have a sugar orchard, as well as an apple orchard.\r\nThe supply of sugar for his family would require as little ground, and the\r\nprocess of making it as easy as that of cider. Mr. Micheaux, your botanist\r\nhere, could send you plants as well as seeds, in any quantity from the\r\nUnited States. I have no doubt the cotton plant will succeed in some of\r\nthe southern parts of France. Whether its culture will be as advantageous\r\nas those they are now engaged in, remains to be tried. We could, in the\r\nUnited States, make as great a variety of wines as are made in Europe,\r\nnot exactly of the same kinds, but doubtless as good. Yet I have ever\r\nobserved to my countrymen, who think its introduction important, that a\r\nlaborer cultivating wheat, rice, tobacco, or cotton here, will be able\r\nwith the proceeds, to purchase double the quantity of the wine he could\r\nmake. Possibly the same quantity of land and labor in France employed on\r\nthe rich produce of your Southern counties, would purchase double the\r\nquantity of the cotton they would yield there. This however may prove\r\notherwise on trial, and therefore it is worthy the trial. In general, it\r\nis a truth that if every nation will employ itself in what it is fittest\r\nto produce, a greater quantity will be raised of the things contributing\r\nto human happiness, than if every nation attempts to raise everything it\r\nwants within itself. The limits within which the cotton plant is worth\r\ncultivating in the United States, are the Rappahanock river to the north,\r\nand the first mountains to the west. And even from the Rappahanock to the\r\nRoanoke, we only cultivate for family use, as it cannot there be afforded\r\nat market in competition with that of the more Southern region. The\r\nMississippi country, also within the same latitudes, admits the culture of\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nThe superficial view I have yet had time to take of your treatise\r\non the cotton plant, induces a belief that it is rich and correct in\r\nits matter, and contains a great fund of learning on that plant. When\r\nretired to rural occupations, as I shall be ere long, I shall profit\r\nof its contents practically, in the culture of that plant merely for\r\nhousehold manufacture. In that situation, too, I shall devote myself to\r\noccupations much more congenial with my inclinations, than those to which\r\nI have been called by the character of the times into which my lot was\r\ncast. About to be relieved from this _corvée_ by age and the fulfilment\r\nof the _quadragena stipendia_, what remains to me of physical activity\r\nwill chiefly be employed in the amusements of agriculture. Having little\r\npractical skill, I count more on the pleasures than the profits of\r\nthat occupation. They will give me, too, the leisure which my present\r\nsituation nearly denies, of rendering such services as may be within\r\nmy means, to the Institute, the Agricultural Society of the Seine, to\r\nyourself, and such other worthy individuals as may find any convenience\r\nin a correspondence here. I shall then be able particularly to fulfil the\r\nwishes expressed, of my sending to the Society of Agriculture a plough\r\nwith my mould-board. Perhaps I may be able to add some other implements,\r\npeculiar to us, to the collection which I perceive that the Society is\r\nmaking. I salute you, Sir, with assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 16, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Complaints multiply upon us of evasions of the embargo laws, by\r\nfraud and force. These come from Newport, Portland, Machias, Nantucket,\r\nMartha's Vineyard, &c., &c. As I do consider the severe enforcement of\r\nthe embargo to be of an importance, not to be measured by money, for our\r\nfuture government as well as present objects, I think it will be advisable\r\nthat during this summer all the gun-boats, actually manned and in\r\ncommission, should be distributed through as many ports and bays as may be\r\nnecessary to assist the embargo. On this subject I will pray you to confer\r\nwith Mr. Gallatin, who will call on you on his passage through Baltimore,\r\nand to communicate with him hereafter, _directly_, without the delay of\r\nconsulting me, and generally to aid this object with such means of your\r\ndepartment as are consistent with its situation.\r\n\r\nI think I shall be able to leave this place by Wednesday. I will mention\r\nfor your information, that the post for Milton leaves this place on\r\nTuesdays and Fridays, and arrives at it on Sundays and, I believe,\r\nThursdays.\r\n\r\nI salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH, OF THE WAR OFFICE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 16, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The correspondence which you sent me the other day, between the\r\nBritish commanders and our officers in Moose Island, is now in the hands\r\nof Mr. Madison, and will be delivered to you on application. On consulting\r\nhim and Mr. Gallatin, I find the facts to be that Moose Island has ever\r\nbeen in our possession, as well before as ever since the treaty of peace\r\nwith Great Britain; that in the convention formed between Mr. King and\r\nthe British government, about four years ago, wherein our limits in that\r\nquarter were mutually recognized, Moose Island was expressly acknowledged\r\nto belong to us; and, through an account of an article respecting\r\nLouisiana, the convention has not yet been ratified, yet both parties have\r\nacted on the article of these limits as if it had been ratified,--each\r\nparty considering the parts then assigned to them as no longer questioned\r\nby the other.\r\n\r\nI think you had better communicate the papers, with a copy of that article\r\nof the convention, to Gen. Dearborne, with these observations, from whom\r\nthe answer to our officer will go with more propriety. If you will speak\r\non this subject with Mr. Madison, he will, perhaps, be able to state to\r\nyou what passed between us on this subject more fully than I have done.\r\nAccept my salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 16, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of May 6th I asked the favor of your Excellency, as\r\nI did of the Governors of other States not furnishing in their interior\r\ncountry flour sufficient for the consumption of the State, to take the\r\ntrouble of giving certificates, in favor of any merchants meriting\r\nconfidence, for the quantities necessary for consumption beyond the\r\ninterior supplies. Having desired from the Treasury Department a statement\r\nof the quantities called for under these certificates, I find that those\r\nof your Excellency, received at the Treasury, amount to 51,000 barrels of\r\nflour, 108,400 bushels of Indian corn, 560 tierces of rice, 2,000 bushels\r\nof rye, and, in addition thereto, that there had been given certificates\r\nfor either 12,450 barrels of flour, or 40,000 bushels of corn. As these\r\nsupplies, although called for within the space of two months, will\r\nundoubtedly furnish the consumption of your State for a much longer time,\r\nI have thought it advisable to ask the favor of your Excellency, after\r\nthe receipt of this letter, to discontinue issuing any other certificates,\r\nthat we may not unnecessarily administer facilities to the evasion of the\r\nembargo laws; for I repeat what I observed in my former letter, that these\r\nevasions are effected chiefly by vessels clearing coastwise. But while\r\nI am desirous of preventing the frauds which go to defeat the salutary\r\nobjects of these laws, I am equally so that the fair consumption of our\r\ncitizens may in nowise be abridged. It would, therefore, be deemed a great\r\nfavor if your Excellency could have me furnished with an estimate, on the\r\nbest data possessed, of the quantities of flour, corn, and rice, which, in\r\naddition to your internal supplies, may be necessary for the consumption,\r\nin any given time, of those parts of your State which habitually depend\r\non importation for these articles. I ask this the more freely, because I\r\npresume you must have had such an estimate formed for the government, of\r\nyour discretion in issuing the preceding certificates, and because it may\r\nbe so necessary for our future government. I salute you with assurance of\r\ngreat respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 17, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--After writing my letter of the 9th, I received one from Mr. Pitot in\r\nthe name of the New Orleans Canal Company, which ought to have come with\r\nthe printed report, stating more fully their views, and more explicitly\r\nthe way in which we can aid them. They ask specifically that we should\r\nlend them $50,000, or take the remaining fourth of their shares now on\r\nhand. This last measure is too much out of our policy of not embarking\r\nthe public in enterprises better managed by individuals, and which might\r\noccupy as much of our time as those political duties for which the public\r\nfunctionaries are particularly instituted. Some money could be lent them,\r\nbut only on an assurance that it would be employed so as to secure the\r\npublic objects. The first interests of the company will be to bring a\r\npracticable navigation from the Lake Pontchartrain through the Bayou St.\r\nJean and Canal de Carondelet to the city, because that entitles them to\r\na toll on the profitable part of the enterprise. But this would answer no\r\nobject of the government unless it was carried through to the Mississippi,\r\nso that our armed vessels drawing five feet water might pass through.\r\nInstead therefore of the ground I suggested in my last letter, I would\r\npropose to lend them a sum of money on the condition of their applying it\r\nentirely to that part of the canal which, beginning at the Mississippi,\r\ngoes round the city to a junction with the canal of Carondelet; and we\r\nmay moreover at our own expense erect the locks. The Secretary at War\r\nnot being here, I cannot propose these or any other terms precisely,\r\nbut you may more openly than I proposed in my last letter, give these\r\nas the general shape of the aid which we contemplate, collect the ideas\r\nof individual members, and communicate them to me, so that when I shall\r\nhave an opportunity of consulting the Secretary at War we may put our\r\nproposition in the form most acceptable to them. On this subject I shall\r\nwish to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nMr. Livingston was here lately, and finding that we considered the Batture\r\nas now resting with Congress, and that it was our duty to keep it clear\r\nof all adversary possession till their decision is obtained, wrote a\r\nletter to the Secretary of State, which, if we understand it, amounts\r\nto a declaration that he will on his return bring the authority of the\r\ncourt into array against that of the executive, and endeavor to obtain\r\na forcible possession. But I presume that the court knows too well that\r\nthe title of the United States to land is subject to the jurisdiction of\r\nno court, it having never been deemed safe to submit the major interests\r\nof the nation to an ordinary tribunal, or to any one but such as the\r\nLegislature establishes for the special occasion; and the Marshal will\r\nfind his duty too plainly marked out in the act of March 3, 1807, to be at\r\na loss to determine what authority he is to obey. It will be well however\r\nthat you should have due attention paid to this subject, and particularly\r\nto apprize Mr. Grymes to be prepared to take care that the public rights\r\nreceive no detriment.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 17, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since I parted with you in Albemarle in September last, I\r\nhave never had a line from you, nor I believe has the Secretary at War\r\nwith whom you have much connection through the Indian department. The\r\nmisfortune which attended the effort to send the Mandan chief home, became\r\nknown to us before you had reached St. Louis. We took no step on the\r\noccasion, counting on receiving your advice so soon as you should be in\r\nplace, and knowing that your knowledge of the whole subject and presence\r\non the spot would enable you to judge better than we could what ought to\r\nbe done. The constant persuasion that something from you must be on its\r\nway to us, has as constantly prevented our writing to you on the subject.\r\nThe present letter, however, is written to put an end at length to this\r\nmutual silence, and to ask from you a communication of what you think\r\nbest to be done to get the chief and his family back. We consider the good\r\nfaith, and the reputation of the nation, as pledged to accomplish this. We\r\nwould wish indeed not to be obliged to undertake any considerable military\r\nexpedition in the present uncertain state of our foreign concerns, and\r\nespecially not till the new body of troops shall be raised. But if it\r\ncan be effected in any other way and at any reasonable expense, we are\r\ndisposed to meet it.\r\n\r\nA powerful company is at length forming for taking up the Indian commerce\r\non a large scale. They will employ a capital the first year of 300,000,\r\nand raise it afterwards to a million. The English Mackinac company will\r\nprobably withdraw from the competition. It will be under the direction of\r\na most excellent man, a Mr. Astor, merchant of New York, long engaged in\r\nthe business, and perfectly master of it. He has some hope of seeing you\r\nat St. Louis, in which case I recommend him to your particular attention.\r\nNothing but the exclusive possession of the Indian commerce can secure us\r\ntheir peace.\r\n\r\nOur foreign affairs do not seem to clear up at all. Should they continue\r\nas at present, the moment will come when it will be a question for the\r\nLegislature whether war will not be preferable to a longer continuance of\r\nthe embargo.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential question is clearing up daily, and the opposition\r\nsubsiding. It is very possible that the suffrage of the nation may be\r\nundivided. But with this question it is my duty not to intermeddle. I\r\nhave not lately heard of your friends in Albemarle. They were well when\r\nI left that in June, and not hearing otherwise affords presumptions they\r\nare well. But I presume you hear that from themselves. We have no tidings\r\nyet of the forwardness of your printer. I hope the first part will not\r\nbe delayed much longer. Wishing you every blessing of life and health, I\r\nsalute you with constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--I had written to Governor Claiborne according to what had\r\nbeen agreed between you and myself, after which I received a letter from\r\nPitot on behalf of the Canal company of New Orleans, which should have\r\naccompanied the printed report I communicated to you. The letter agrees\r\nwith the report, and asks specifically that we should either lend them\r\nfifty thousand dollars, or buy the remaining fourth part of their shares\r\nnow on hand. On consultation with Mr. Madison, Gallatin, and Rodney, we\r\nconcluded it best to say we would lend them a sum of money if they would\r\nagree to lay out the whole of it in making the canal from the Mississippi\r\nround the town to its junction with the canal of Carondelet; and I wrote\r\nto Claiborne to sound the members of the company, and to find out if there\r\nwere any modifications which would render the proposition more acceptable,\r\nto communicate them to me, and that when I should have an opportunity of\r\nconsulting you, we would make the proposition in form.\r\n\r\nI send you a letter of General Wilkinson's, the papers it covered, and\r\nmy answer, which will sufficiently explain themselves. That in cases of\r\nmilitary operations some occasions for secret service money must arise,\r\nis certain. But I think that they should be more fully explained to the\r\ngovernment than the General has done, seems also proper.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith will send you some British complaints on our fortifying Moose\r\nIslands, and the kind of answer recommended on consultation with the heads\r\nof departments.\r\n\r\nWe have such complaints of the breach of embargo by fraud and force on our\r\nnorthern water line, that I must pray your co-operation with the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury by rendezvousing as many new recruits as you can in that\r\nquarter. The Osage brought us nothing in the least interesting. I salute\r\nyou with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of May 28 has been duly received, and in it the\r\nproceeding of the Court on the mandamus to the collector of Charleston. I\r\nsaw them with great concern because of the quarter from whence they came,\r\nand where they could not be ascribed to any political waywardness.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature having found, after repeated trials, that no general\r\nrules could be formed which fraud and avarice would not elude, concluded\r\nto leave, in those who were to execute the power, a discretionary power\r\nparamount to all their general rules. This discretion was of necessity\r\nlodged with the collector in the first instance, but referred, finally, to\r\nthe President, lest there should be as many measures of law or discretion\r\nfor our citizens as there were collectors of districts. In order that the\r\nfirst decisions by the collectors might also be as uniform as possible,\r\nand that the inconveniences of temporary detention might be imposed by\r\ngeneral and equal rules throughout the States, we thought it advisable to\r\ndraw some outlines for the government of the discretion of the collectors,\r\nand to bring them all to one tally.\r\n\r\nWith this view they were advised to consider all shipments of flour _primâ\r\nfacie_, as suspicious. Because, if pretended to be for a State which made\r\nenough within itself, it could not, in these times, but be suspicious,\r\nand, if for a State which needed importations, we had provided, by the aid\r\nof the Governors of those States, a criterion for that case.\r\n\r\nBut your collector seems to have decided for himself that, instead of\r\na general rule applicable equally to all, the personal character of the\r\nshipper was a better criterion, and his own individual opinion too, of\r\nthat character.\r\n\r\nYou will see at once to what this would have led in the hands of\r\nan hundred collectors, of all sorts of characters, connections, and\r\nprinciples, and what grounds would have been given for the malevolent\r\ncharges of favoritism with which the federal papers have reproached even\r\nthe trust we reposed in the first and highest magistrates of particular\r\nStates. It has been usual in another department, after the decision of\r\nany point by the superior tribunal is known, for the interior one to\r\nconform to that decision. The declaration of Mr. Theus, that _he_ did not\r\nconsider the case as suspicious, founded on his individual opinion of the\r\nshipper, broke down that barrier which we had endeavored to erect against\r\nfavoritism, and furnished the grounds for the subsequent proceedings. The\r\nattorney for the United States seems to have considered the acquiescence\r\nof the collector as dispensing with any particular attentions to the case,\r\nand the judge to have taken it as a case agreed between plaintiff and\r\ndefendant, and brought to him only formally to be placed on his records.\r\nBut this question has too many important bearings on the constitutional\r\norganization of our government, to let it go off so carelessly. I send you\r\nthe Attorney General's opinion on it, formed on great consideration and\r\nconsultation. It is communicated to the collectors and marshals for their\r\nfuture government. I hope, however, the business will stop here, and that\r\nno similar case will occur. A like attempt has been made in another State,\r\nwhich I believe failed in the outset.\r\n\r\nI have seen, with great satisfaction, the circumspection and moderation\r\nwith which you have been so good as to act under my letter of May 6th.\r\nI owe the same approbation to some other of the Governors, but not to\r\nevery one. Our good citizens having submitted to such sacrifices under\r\nthe present experiment, I am determined to exert every power the law has\r\nvested in me for its rigorous fulfilment; that we may know the full value\r\nand effect of this measure on any future occasion on which a resort to it\r\nmight be contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe Osage did not bring us a tittle of anything interesting. The absence\r\nof the Emperor from Paris makes that a scene of no business; and I do not\r\nthink we are to consider the course of the British government as finally\r\ndecided, until the nation, as well as the ministry, are possessed of the\r\ncommunications to Congress of March 22, and our act hanging the duration\r\nof the embargo laws on that of the orders of council. The newspapers\r\nsay Mr. Rose is coming over again. Mr. Pinckney did not know this at\r\nthe departure of the Osage. Yet it may be so. It is well calculated to\r\nthrow dust in the eyes of the nation, and to silence all attempts of\r\nthe opposition to force a change of their measures. In this view it is a\r\nmasterly stroke. The truth is that their debt is become such as the nation\r\ncan no longer pay its interest. Their omnipotence at sea has bloated their\r\nimaginations so as to persuade them they can oblige all nations to carry\r\nall their produce to their island as an entrepot, to pay them a tax on it,\r\nand receive their license to carry it to its ultimate market. It is indeed\r\na desperate throw, in the language of Canning, and who knows, says he,\r\nwhat the dice may turn up?\r\n\r\nI answer, we know.\r\n\r\nSince writing so far, I received your favor of June 30th, covering\r\nresolutions of your Legislature. They are truly worthy of them, and never\r\ncould declarations be better timed for dissipating the delusions in which\r\nthe British government are nourished by the federal papers, and prevented\r\nfrom that return to justice which alone can continue our peace.\r\n\r\nWishing you every blessing of health and life, I salute you with\r\nassurances of great esteem and respect. Salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, July 25,1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you the petition of Somes, to do in it whatever is\r\nagreeable to general rule.\r\n\r\nPunqua Winchung, the Chinese Mandarin, has, I believe, his head quarters\r\nat New York, and therefore his case is probably known to you. He came\r\nto Washington just as I had left it, and therefore wrote to me, praying\r\npermission to depart for his own country with his property, in a vessel to\r\nbe engaged by himself. I enclose you Mr. Madison's letter, which contains\r\neverything I know on the subject. I consider it as a case of national\r\ncomity, and coming within the views of the first section of the first\r\nembargo act. The departure of this individual with good dispositions, may\r\nbe the means of making our nation known advantageously at the source of\r\npower in China, to which it is otherwise difficult to convey information.\r\nIt may be of sensible advantage to our merchants in that country. I cannot\r\ntherefore but consider that a chance of obtaining a permanent national\r\ngood should overweigh the effect of a single case taken out of the great\r\nfield of the embargo. The case, too, is so singular, that it can lead to\r\nno embarrassment as a precedent.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, he should be permitted to engage a vessel to carry\r\nhimself and his property, under such cautions and recommendations to him\r\nas you shall think best.\r\n\r\nI leave it therefore to yourself to direct all the necessary details\r\nwithout further application to me, and for this purpose send you a blank\r\npassport for the vessel, &c., and Mr. Graham will obtain and forward you\r\npassports from the foreign ministers here. I salute you with affection and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BIBB.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 28, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received duly your favor of July 1st, covering an offer of Mr.\r\nMcDonald of an iron mine to the public, and I thank you for taking the\r\ntrouble of making the communication, as it might have its utility. But\r\nhaving always observed that public works are much less advantageously\r\nmanaged than the same are by private hands, I have thought it better for\r\nthe public to go to market for whatever it wants which is to be found\r\nthere; for there competition brings it down to the minimum of value. I\r\nhave no doubt we can buy brass cannon at market cheaper than we could make\r\niron ones. I think it material too, not to abstract the high executive\r\nofficers from those functions which nobody else is charged to carry on,\r\nand to employ them in superintending works which are going on abundantly\r\nin private hands. Our predecessors went on different principles; they\r\nbought iron mines, and sought for copper ones. We own a mine at Harper's\r\nFerry of the finest iron ever put into a cannon, which we are afraid to\r\nattempt to work. We have rented it heretofore, but it is now without a\r\ntenant.\r\n\r\nWe send a vessel to France and England every six weeks, for the purposes\r\nof public as well as mercantile correspondence. These the public papers\r\nare in the habit of magnifying into special missionaries for great and\r\nspecial purposes. It is true that they carry our public despatches,\r\nwhether the subject of the day happens to be great or small. The Osage\r\nwas one of these; but she was charged with nothing more than repetitions\r\nof instructions to our ministers not to cease in their endeavors to have\r\nthe obnoxious orders and decrees repealed. She brought not a tittle of the\r\nleast interest. The St. Michael was another of these vessels, and may now\r\nbe expected in a few days. The schooner Hope was a third, and sailed a few\r\ndays ago. She may be expected a fortnight before Congress meets, and our\r\nministers are apprized that whatsoever the belligerent powers mean to do,\r\nmust be done before that time, as on the state of things then existing\r\nand known to us, Congress will have to act. I return the letter of Mr.\r\nMcDonald, as it may be useful for other purposes, and salute you with\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 29, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a letter of information of what is passing on the\r\nCanada line. To prevent it is, I suppose, beyond our means, but we must\r\ntry to harass the unprincipled agents, and punish as many as we can.\r\n\r\nI transmit, also, the petition of Tyson and James, millers of Baltimore,\r\nfor permission to send a load of flour to New Orleans, to direct in\r\nit what is regular, for I do not see any circumstance in the case\r\nsufficiently peculiar to take it out of the rule. If their views are\r\nhonest, as I suppose them to be, it would be a great relief to them to\r\nbe permitted, by giving bond for an increased valuation, to send their\r\nflour to its destination, and equal relief to us from these tormenting\r\napplications. Yet, as the other gentlemen seemed not satisfied that\r\nit would be legal, I would not have it done on my own opinion alone,\r\nhowever firmly I am persuaded of its legality. Could you not in the way\r\nof conversation with some of the sound lawyers of New York, find what\r\nwould be then _primâ facie_ opinion, and if encouraged by that, we may\r\ntake the opinion of the Attorney General, and others. The questions to be\r\nsolved are,--first: To what place should the valuation refer? and second:\r\nWould too high a valuation render the bond null in law? On the first, I\r\nobserve that the law says that bond shall be given in double the value,\r\n&c., without saying whether its value _here_, or at the _place of sale_,\r\nis meant; that, generally speaking, its value _here_ would be understood;\r\nbut that whenever the words of a law will bear two meanings, one of which\r\nwill give effect to the law, and the other will defeat it, the former\r\nmust be supposed to have been intended by the Legislature, because they\r\ncould not intend that meaning, which would defeat their intention, in\r\npassing that law; and in a statute, as in a will, the intention of the\r\nparty is to be sought after. On the second point we would ask, who is to\r\nvalue the cargo on which the bond is to be taken? Certainly the collector,\r\neither by himself or his agents. When the bond is put in suit it must be\r\nrecovered. Neither judge nor jury can go into the question of the value\r\nof the cargo. If anybody could, it would be the chancellor; but his maxim\r\nis never to lend his power in support of fraud or wrong. The common law\r\ncould only give a remedy on an action for damages, as, for instance, if a\r\ncollector, by requiring too large security, prevents a party from clearing\r\nout, damages might be recovered. But in the case in question, the consent\r\nof the party would take away the error, and besides, as the voyage takes\r\nplace, no damages for preventing it can be recovered. These are general\r\nconsiderations to be brought into view in such a conversation, which,\r\nindeed would occur to every lawyer who turned his mind to the subject\r\nat all. It would be a most important construction for the relief of the\r\nhonest merchant, to whom the amount of bond is important, and to us, also,\r\nin the execution of the law; and I think its legality far more defensible\r\nthan that of limiting the provisions to one-eighth of the cargo. My\r\nsituation in the country gives me no opportunity to consult lawyers of the\r\nfirst order. Should such occur, however, I will avail myself of them.\r\n\r\nI salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 29, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The passport for the Leonidas goes by this post, to the\r\ncollector of Norfolk. I return you Jarvis', Hackley's, and Montgomery's\r\nletters, and send you Hull's, Hunt's, Clarke's, and Mr. Short's, for\r\nperusal, and to be returned. On this last, the following questions arise:\r\nWhen exactly shall the next vessel go? Whence? Is not the secrecy of\r\nthe mission essential? Is it not the very ground of sending it while the\r\nSenate is not sitting, in order that it may be kept secret? I doubt the\r\nexpediency of sending one of our regular armed vessels. If we do, she\r\nshould go to Petersburg direct. And yet may there not be advantage in\r\nconferences between S. and A.? I have signed the commission and letter of\r\ncredence, and now enclose them. Yet I must say I think the latter is very\r\nquestionable indeed, in point of property. It says that the Minister is to\r\n_reside_ near his person; but whether we should establish it at once into\r\na permanent legation is much to be doubted, and especially in a recess\r\nof the Senate. I should think it better to express purposes something\r\nlike the following: \"to bear to your Imperial Majesty the assurances\r\nof the sincere friendship of the United States, and of their desire to\r\nmaintain with your Majesty and your subjects the strictest relations of\r\nintercourse and commerce; to explain to your Majesty the position of the\r\nUnited States, and the considerations flowing from that which should keep\r\nthem aloof from the contests of Europe; to assure your Majesty of their\r\ndesire to observe a faithful and impartial neutrality, if not forced from\r\nthat line by the wrongs of the belligerents; and to express their reliance\r\nthat they will be befriended in these endeavors by your Majesty's powerful\r\ninfluence and friendship towards these States.\" This is hasty,--it is too\r\nlong, and neither the expressions nor thoughts sufficiently accurate; but\r\nsomething of this kind, more concise and correct, may be formed, leaving\r\nthe permanency of the mission still in our power.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that the transaction at New Orleans, between Ortega\r\nand the British officer with the prize sloop Guadaloupe, has been a mere\r\nfraud, to evade our regulation against the sale of prizes in our harbors;\r\nand his insolent letter intended merely to cover the fraud. His ready\r\nabandonment of the vessel, and Ortega's resumption of her, are clear\r\nproofs. Should not, or could not, process be ordered against Ortega and\r\nthe vessel? I think a copy of Reeve's letter to Governor Claiborne, and of\r\nthe proceedings of the court, might be sent to Mr. Erskine, with proper\r\nobservations on this double outrage, and an intimation that the habitual\r\ninsolence of their officers may force us to refuse them an asylum, even\r\nwhen seeking it in real distress, if the boon is to be abused as it has\r\nbeen by this insolent and dishonest officer. And as it is very possible\r\nthe rascal may push his impostures to the making complaint to his\r\ngovernment, this step with Mr. Erskine may anticipate it.\r\n\r\nI salute you with sincere and constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 5, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a letter from the Path-killer and others of the\r\nCherokees, the object of which I do not precisely see. I suppose they are\r\nof Van's party. The sentiments are unquestionably those of a white man.\r\n\r\nSibley's letters present a disagreeable view. It will be troublesome\r\nif we are once compelled to use acts of force against those people. It\r\nis the more difficult as we should have to pursue them into the country\r\nbeyond the Sabine, on which an understanding with the Spaniards would be\r\nnecessary. But what is the meaning of our not pursuing deserters over the\r\nRio Hondo? I thought we had so far settled that matter, as that it was\r\nunderstood by the Spaniards that until a final settlement of boundary, the\r\nSabine was to be that to which each was to exercise jurisdiction. On the\r\nsame principles ought we not immediately to suppress this new appointment\r\nof a Spanish Alcalde at Bayou Pierre? I ask this for information, because\r\nI do not precisely recollect what we finally intended as to Bayou Pierre,\r\nand I have not the papers here. I suppose the trial and punishment of the\r\nguilty Alibamas, and Sibley's reclamations with the tribe for reparation,\r\nwill give us time till we meet to consider what is to be done. Has any and\r\nwhat step been taken for the recovery of Pike's men?\r\n\r\nGovernor Lewis' letter offers something more serious. The only information\r\nI have on the subject, is his letter to Governor Harrison in a newspaper,\r\nwhich I cut out and enclose you. The retirement of White Hairs to St.\r\nLouis is strong proof that the case is serious. As they are at war with\r\nall nations, and in order to protect them we have been endangering our\r\npeace and friendship with the other nation, would not our best course\r\nbe to inform all those nations that, however desirous we have been of\r\npromoting peace among them, and however earnest our endeavors have been\r\nto restore friendship between them and the Osages particularly, we have\r\nfound it impossible to bring that nation to a just and peaceable conduct\r\ntowards others? That therefore we withdraw ourselves from before them, and\r\nleave them to be freely attacked and destroyed by all those who have cause\r\nof war against them? Would such a written message from me to the nations\r\nat war with them, be advisable? particularly to the Cherokees, Creeks,\r\nChickasaws, and Choctaws, and such _northern_ tribes as are at war with\r\nthem. I do not recollect those of the latter description. Would it not be\r\nadvisable to aid their war parties with provisions, and ammunition, and\r\nthe repairs of their arms at our posts? Will it be necessary to authorize\r\nexpeditions of militia, or only permit volunteers to join the Indian\r\nparties? or shall we leave what respects Militia to Governor Lewis? We\r\nshall certainly receive further information soon, but in the meantime I\r\nhave thought we should turn it in our minds, and interchange ideas on the\r\nsubject. I shall therefore be glad to hear from you on it. I salute you\r\nwith constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A complaint has come to me indirectly on the part of the\r\nCadets at West Point, that the promotions in their corps are made on\r\nother principles than those of seniority or merit. They do not charge\r\nColonel Williams with an unjust selection by himself, but with leaving\r\nthe selection to his lieutenant, whose declaration that it was so left to\r\nhim, they say can be proved. It is stated particularly that a young man\r\nfrom the country, uneducated, and who had been with the corps but three\r\nmonths, and had acquired little there, was lately made an ensign to the\r\nprejudice of much superior qualifications. His name was mentioned to me\r\nbut I have forgotten it. Justice to the officers forbids us to give credit\r\nto such imputations till proved; but justice to the corps requires us\r\nso far to attend to them as to make them the subject of inquiry; and I\r\npresume this was the object of the communication to me. I now mention it\r\nto you, because in returning through New York you may have an opportunity\r\nof inquiring into it. I am much more inclined to impute to the vanity of\r\nthe lieutenant the declaration he is said to have made, than to suppose\r\nColonel Williams has really delegated so important a trust to him. I\r\nsalute you with constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. KERR, MOORE, AND WILLIAMS, COMMISSIONERS OF THE WESTERN ROAD.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--It has been represented to me on behalf of the inhabitants\r\nof the town of Washington in Pennsylvania, that by a survey made at their\r\nexpense, it is found that the western road, if carried through their town,\r\nto Wheeling, would be but a mile longer, would pass through better ground,\r\nand be made at less expense; and if carried to Short Creek, instead of\r\nWheeling, the difference of distance would still be less. The principal\r\nobject of this road is a communication directly westwardly. If, however,\r\ninconsiderable deflections from this course will benefit particular\r\nplaces, and better accommodate travellers, these are circumstances to be\r\ntaken into consideration. I have therefore to desire that, having a regard\r\nto the funds which remain, you make as good an examination as they will\r\nadmit, of the best route through Washington to Wheeling, and also to Short\r\nCreek or any other point on the river, offering a more advantageous route\r\ntowards Chillicothe and Cincinatti, and that you report to me the material\r\nfacts, with your opinions for consideration. I salute you with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On the subject of the western road, our first error was\r\nthe admitting a deviation to Brownsville, and thus suffering a first\r\nencroachment on its principle. This is made a point d'appui to force a\r\nsecond, and I am told a third holds itself in reserve, so that a few towns\r\nin that quarter seem to consider all this expense as undertaken merely\r\nfor their benefit. I should have listened to these solicitations with more\r\npatience, had it not been for the unworthy motives presented to influence\r\nme by some of those interested. Sometimes an opposition by force was\r\nheld up, sometimes electioneering effects, as if I were to barter away,\r\non such motives, a public trust committed to me for a different object.\r\nIt seems, however, that our first error having made Brownsville, and no\r\nlonger Cumberland, the point of departure, we must now go no further back\r\nin examining the claim of Washington. I have therefore written to the\r\ncommissioners, the letter of which I enclose you a copy. The time saved\r\nby sending it to them direct, may be important, as they may be near their\r\nreturn. I am doubtful whether they have money enough left for a thorough\r\nexamination. If they have, their report will enable us to decide on this\r\nsecond deflection. But what will Wheeling say if we take the road from\r\nit, to give it to Washington? I do not know its size or importance, nor\r\nwhether some obstacles to navigation may not oppose our crossing at a\r\nhigher place. I salute you with constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of July 27th is received. It confirms the accounts we\r\nreceive from others that the infractions of the embargo in Maine and\r\nMassachusetts are open. I have removed Pope, of New Bedford, for worse\r\nthan negligence. The collector of Sullivan is on the totter. The tories\r\nof Boston openly threaten insurrection if their importation of flour\r\nis stopped. The next post will stop it. I fear your Governor is not up\r\nto the tone of these parricides, and I hope, on the first symptom of an\r\nopen opposition of the law by force, you will fly to the scene and aid in\r\nsuppressing any commotion.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the letter of Captain Dillard, recommending Walter Bourke\r\nfor appointment. I know nothing of the writers of any of the letters\r\nexcept Thore, Jones, and Thweat, who are good men. I like Meigs' scheme\r\nwith the Cherokees, and would wish it success. But will Congress give such\r\na sum of money. The message of the Creek Chief is so far satisfactory,\r\nthat I think we should give them time. Could we engage them to assist\r\nus in destroying the guilty banditti? The letter enclosed from Cuthbert\r\nto Mr. Madison, on the means of taking Quebec, is worthy notice, and\r\nI wish you could, before your return, have an interview with him. Your\r\noffice, and receipt of the letter from me, will give confidence to his\r\ncommunications. We have letters from Mr. Pinckney to May 30, but not one\r\nword interesting. Present me respectfully to Mrs. Dearborne, and accept my\r\naffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you, for your information, letters from General\r\nDearborne, P. D. Sargent, and Elisha Tracey, on the infractions of the\r\nembargo, and their ideas on the means of remedy.\r\n\r\nI pass them through the hands of the Secretary of the Navy, with a request\r\nthat he will, in concert with you, give all the aid for the enforcement\r\nof the law which his department can afford. I think the conduct of Jordan,\r\nat Sullivan, should be inquired into, with a view to his removal if found\r\neither undisposed or negligent. Indeed, the distance of his residence, if\r\nit be fact, renders it impossible he should even sufficiently superintend\r\nthe due execution of the duties of his office.\r\n\r\nWe have letters from Mr. Pinckney of the 30th of May, but containing not\r\none interesting word. If England should be disposed to continue peace\r\nwith us, and Spain gives to Bonaparte the occupation she promises, will\r\nnot the interval be favorable for our reprisals on the Floridas for the\r\nindemnifications withheld. Before the meeting of Congress we shall see\r\nfurther. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,-- * * * * * I have some apprehension the tories of Boston,\r\n&c., with so poor a head of a Governor, may attempt to give us trouble. I\r\nhave requested General Dearborne to be on the alert, and fly to the spot\r\nwhere any open and forcible opposition shall be commenced, and to crush\r\nit in embryo. I am not afraid but that there is sound matter enough in\r\nMassachusetts to prevent an opposition of the laws by force. I am glad to\r\nsee that Spain is likely to give Bonaparte employment. _Tant mieux pour\r\nnous._ Accept affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 11, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of July 29th and August 5th, came to hand\r\nyesterday, and I now return you those of Wynne, Wolsey, Quincy,\r\nOtis, Lincoln, and Dearborne. This embargo law is certainly the most\r\nembarrassing one we have ever had to execute. I did not expect a crop of\r\nso sudden and rank growth of fraud and open opposition by force could have\r\ngrown up in the United States. I am satisfied with you that if orders and\r\ndecrees are not repealed, and a continuance of the embargo is preferred\r\nto war, (which sentiment is universal here), Congress must legalize\r\nall _means_ which may be necessary to obtain its _end_. Mr. Smith, in\r\nenclosing to me General Dearborne's and Lincoln's letters, informs me\r\nthat immediately on receiving them he gave the necessary orders to the\r\nChesapeake, the Wasp and Argus. Still I shall pass this letter and those\r\nit encloses, through his hands for information. I am clearly of opinion\r\nthis law ought to be enforced at any expense, _which may not exceed our\r\nappropriation_. I approve of the instructions to General Lincoln, for\r\nselling the revenue cutter there and buying another, and also of what you\r\npropose at New London and Portsmouth, and generally I wish you to do as\r\nto the revenue cutters what you shall think best, without delaying it to\r\nhear from me. You possess the details so much better than I do, and are so\r\nmuch nearer the principal scenes, that my approbation can be but matter\r\nof form. As to ordering out militia, you know the difficulty without\r\nanother proclamation. I advise Mr. Madison to inform General Turreau that\r\nthe vessels we allow to the foreign ministers are only in the character\r\nof transports, and that they cannot be allowed but where the number of\r\npersons bears the proportion to the vessel which is usual with transports.\r\nYou will see by my last that on learning the situation of affairs in\r\nSpain, it had occurred to me that it might produce a favorable occasion\r\nof doing ourselves justice in the south. We must certainly so dispose of\r\nour southern recruits and armed vessels as to be ready for the occasion.\r\nA letter of June 5th from Mr. Pinckney says nothing more than that in a\r\nfew days he was to have a full conference on our affairs with Mr. Canning.\r\nThat will doubtless produce us immediately an interesting letter from him.\r\nI salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\nP. S. I this day direct a commission for General Steele, vice General\r\nShee, deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of July 30th came to hand yesterday. It has consequently\r\nloitered somewhere two posts. I am glad to learn the prompt aid you\r\nhave afforded the Treasury department. To let you further understand\r\nthe importance of giving all the aid we can, I pass through your hands\r\nmy letter of this day to Mr. Gallatin, with those it encloses, which I\r\nwill pray you, after perusal, to seal and put into the post-office. In\r\nthe support of the embargo laws, our only limit should be that of the\r\nappropriations of the department. A letter of June 5th from Mr. Pinckney\r\ninforms us he was to have a free conference with Canning, in a few days.\r\nShould England get to rights with us, while Bonaparte is at war with\r\nSpain, the moment may be favorable to take possession of our own territory\r\nheld by Spain, and so much more as may make a proper reprisal for her\r\nspoliations. We ought therefore to direct the rendezvous of our southern\r\nrecruits and gun-boats so as to be in proper position for striking the\r\nstroke in an instant, when Congress shall will it. I have recommended\r\nthis to General Dearborne, as I now do to yourself. Mr. Fulton writes to\r\nme under a great desire to prepare a decisive experiment of his torpedo\r\nat Washington, for the meeting of Congress. This means of harbor-defence\r\nhas acquired such respectability, from its apparent merit, from the\r\nattention shown it by other nations, and from our own experiments at\r\nNew York, as to entitle it to a full experiment from us. He asks only\r\ntwo workmen for one month from us, which he estimates at $130 only. But\r\nshould it cost considerably more I should really be for granting it,\r\nand would accordingly recommend it to you. This sum is a mere trifle as\r\nan encroachment on our appropriation. I salute you with affection and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of July 27th has been received. I now enclose you\r\nthe letters of Hawkins, Harrison, Wells, Hull, and Claiborne, received\r\nfrom the war office, and as I conjecture, not yet seen by you. Indian\r\nappearances, both in the northwest and south, are well. Beyond the\r\nMississippi they are not so favorable. I fear Governor Lewis has been too\r\nprompt in committing us with the Osages so far as to oblige us to go on.\r\nBut it is astonishing we get not one word from him. I enclose you letters\r\nof Mr. Griff and Maclure, which will explain themselves. A letter of June\r\n5th from Mr. Pinckney, informs us he was to have a free conference with\r\nCanning in a few days. Should England make up with us, while Bonaparte\r\ncontinues at war with Spain, a moment may occur when we may without danger\r\nof commitment with either France or England seize to our own limits of\r\nLouisiana as of right, and the residue of the Floridas as reprisal for\r\nspoliations. It is our duty to have an eye to this in rendezvousing and\r\nstationing our new recruits and our armed vessels, so as to be ready, if\r\nCongress authorizes it, to strike in a moment. I wish you to consider this\r\nmatter in the orders to the southern recruits, as I have also recommended\r\nto the Secretary of the Navy, as to the armed vessels in the South.\r\nIndeed, I would ask your opinion as to the positions we had better take\r\nwith a view to this with our armed vessels as well as troops. The force\r\nin the neighborhood of Baton Rouge is enough for that. Mobile, Pensacola\r\nand St. Augustine, are those we should be preparing for. The enforcing the\r\nembargo would furnish a pretext for taking the nearest healthy position\r\nto St. Mary's, and on the waters of Tombigbee. I salute you with affection\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 10th came to hand yesterday, and I return you\r\nFronda's, Tuft's, Loderstrom's, and Turreau's letters. I think it is\r\nbecome necessary to let Turreau understand explicitly that the vessels\r\nwe permit foreign ministers to send away are merely transports, for the\r\nconveyance of such of their subjects as were here at the time of the\r\nembargo; that the numbers must be proportioned to the vessels, as is usual\r\nwith transports; and that all who meant to go away must be presumed to\r\nhave gone before now,--at any rate, that none will be accommodated after\r\nthe present vessel. We never can allow one belligerent to buy and fit out\r\nvessels here, to be manned with his own people, and probably act against\r\nthe other. You did not return my answer to Sullivan. But fortunately I\r\nhave received another letter, which will enable me to give the matter an\r\neasier turn, and let it down more softly. Should the conference announced\r\nin Mr. Pinckney's letter of June 5th, settle friendship between England\r\nand us, and Bonaparte continue at war with Spain, a moment may occur\r\nfavorable, without compromitting us with either France or England, for\r\nseizing our own from the Rio Bravo to Perdido, as of right, and the\r\nresidue of Florida, as a reprisal for spoliations. I have thought it\r\nproper to suggest this possibility to General Dearborne and Mr. Smith, and\r\nto recommend an eye to it in their rendezvousing and stationing the new\r\nsouthern recruits and gun-boats, so that we may strike in a moment when\r\nCongress says so. I have appointed General Steele successor to Shee. Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Barlow, and Mrs. Blayden, will be here about the 25th. May we\r\nhope to see Mrs. Madison and yourself then, or when? I shall go to Bedford\r\nabout the 10th of September. I salute you with constant affection and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of July 21st has been received some days; that of July\r\n23d not till yesterday. Some accident had probably detained it on the\r\nroad considerably beyond its regular passage. In the former you mention\r\nthat you had thought it advisable to continue issuing certificates for\r\nthe importation of flour, until you could hear further from me; and in the\r\nlatter, that you will be called from the Capital in the fall months, after\r\nwhich it is your desire that the power of issuing certificates may be\r\ngiven to some other, if it is to be continued.\r\n\r\nIn mine of July 16th I had stated that, during the two months preceding\r\nthat, your certificates, received at the Treasury, amounted, if I rightly\r\nrecollect, to about 60,000 barrels of flour, and a proportionable\r\nquantity of corn. If this whole quantity had been _bonâ fide_ landed\r\nand retained in Massachusetts, I deemed it certain there could not be\r\na real want for a considerable time, and, therefore, desired the issues\r\nof certificates might be discontinued. If, on the other hand, a part has\r\nbeen carried to foreign markets, it proves the necessity of restricting\r\nreasonably this avenue to abuse. This is my sole object, and not that a\r\nreal want of a single individual should be one day unsupplied. In this\r\nI am certain we shall have the concurrence of all the good citizens of\r\nMassachusetts, who are too patriotic and too just to desire, by calling\r\nfor what is superfluous, to open a door for the frauds of unprincipled\r\nindividuals who, trampling on the laws, and forcing a commerce shut to\r\nall others, are enriching themselves on the sacrifices of their honester\r\nfellow citizens;--sacrifices to which these are generally and willingly\r\nsubmitting as equally necessary whether to avoid or prepare for war.\r\n\r\nStill further, however, to secure the State against all danger of want,\r\nI will request you to continue issuing certificates, in the moderate\r\nway proposed in your letter, until your departure from the Capital, as\r\nbefore stated, when I will consider it as discontinued, or make another\r\nappointment if necessary. There is less risk of inconvenience in this,\r\nas, by a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, of May 20th, the\r\ncollectors were advised not to detain any vessel, the articles of whose\r\nlading were so proportioned as to give no cause of suspicion that they\r\nwere destined for a foreign market. This mode of supply alone seems to\r\nhave been sufficient for the other importing States, if we may judge from\r\nthe little use they have made of the permission to issue certificates.\r\n\r\nShould these reasonable precautions be followed, as is surmised in\r\nyour letter of July 21st, by an artificial scarcity, with a view to\r\npromote turbulence of any sort or on any pretext, I trust for an ample\r\nsecurity against this danger to the character of my fellow citizens of\r\nMassachusetts, which has, I think, been emphatically marked by obedience\r\nto law, and a love of order. And I have no doubt that whilst we do\r\nour duty, they will support us in it. The laws enacted by the general\r\ngovernment, will have made it our duty to have the embargo strictly\r\nobserved, for the general good; and we are sworn to execute the laws. If\r\nclamor ensue, it will be from the few only, who will clamor whatever we\r\ndo. I shall be happy to receive the estimate promised by your Excellency,\r\nas it may assist to guide us in the cautions we may find necessary.\r\nAnd here I will beg leave to recall your attention to a mere error of\r\narithmetic in your letter of July 23d. The quantity of flour requisite\r\non the data there given, would be between thirteen and fourteen thousand\r\nbarrels per month. I beg you to accept my salutations, and assurances of\r\nhigh respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. FULTON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Immediately on the receipt of your letter of the 5th, I wrote to\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, recommending a compliance with your request\r\nof the workmen. Although no public servant could justify the risking the\r\nsafety of an important seaport, solely on untried means of defence, yet\r\nI have great confidence in those proposed by you as additional to the\r\nordinary means. Their small cost, too, in comparison with the object,\r\nought to overrule those rigorous attentions to keep within the limits\r\nof our appropriations, which have probably weighed with the Secretary\r\nin declining the proposition. You are sensible, too, that harassed as\r\nthe offices are daily by the visions of unsound heads, even those solid\r\ninventions destined to better our condition, feel the effects of being\r\ngrouped with them. Wishing every success to your experiment, I salute you\r\nwith esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. I. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I this moment receive your favor of the 12th, with Captain Saunders'\r\nletter on the acquisition of a site for a battery at Norfolk. I think\r\nthat, instead of acceding to the proposition to take the whole three\r\nacres at $1,500, it will be better to accept the other alternative of Mr.\r\nThompson, to have the ground valued by proper persons. In this case too it\r\nshould be attempted to restrain the purchase to the half acre, as desired\r\nby the Secretary at War, but if the owner insists on selling the whole or\r\nnone, the whole should be taken rather than let the works of defence be\r\ndelayed. You will be pleased to give instructions accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe despatches hitherto received at the War Office, and forwarded to\r\nme, I have from time to time sent directly to General Dearborne, on the\r\npresumption they had not yet been seen by him. If this is wrong, be so\r\ngood as to notify me of it. I return you Captain Saunders' letter, and\r\ntender you my salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR TOMPKINS.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have this day received your Excellency's favor of the 9th instant,\r\nand I now return you the papers it enclosed. The case of opposition\r\nto the embargo laws on the Canada line, I take to be that of distinct\r\ncombinations of a number of individuals to oppose by force and arms the\r\nexecution of those laws, for which purpose they go armed, fire upon the\r\npublic guards, in one instance at least have wounded one dangerously, and\r\nrescue property held under these laws. This may not be an insurrection\r\nin the popular sense of the word, but being arrayed in warlike-manner,\r\nactually committing acts of war, and persevering systematically in\r\ndefiance of the public authority, brings it so fully within the legal\r\ndefinition of an insurrection, that I should not hesitate to issue a\r\nproclamation, were I not restrained by motives of which your Excellency\r\nseems to be apprized. But as by the laws of New York an insurrection\r\ncan be acted on without a previous proclamation, I should conceive it\r\nperfectly correct to act on it as such, and I cannot doubt it would be\r\napproved by every good citizen. Should you think proper to do so, I will\r\nundertake that the necessary detachments of militia called out in support\r\nof the laws, shall be considered as in the service of the United States,\r\nand at their expense. And as it has been intimated to me that you would\r\nprobably take the trouble of going to the spot yourself, I will refer to\r\nyour discretion the measures to be taken, and the numbers to be called out\r\nat different places, only saying, as duty requires me to fix some limit,\r\nthat the whole must not exceed five hundred men without further consulting\r\nme. Should you be willing to take the trouble of going to the place,\r\nyou will render a great public service, as I am persuaded your presence\r\nthere will be such a manifestation of the public determination to support\r\nthe authority of the laws, as will probably deter the insurgents from\r\npursuing their course. I think it so important in example to crush these\r\naudacious proceedings, and to make the offenders feel the consequences\r\nof individuals daring to oppose a law by force, that no effort should be\r\nspared to compass this object. As promptitude is requisite, and the delay\r\nof consulting me on details at this distance might defeat our views, I\r\nwould rather, where you entertain doubts, that you would satisfy yourself\r\nby conference with the Secretary of the Treasury, who is with you, and\r\nto whom our general views are familiar. I salute you with esteem and high\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 6th and 9th, are just now received, as well as\r\na letter from Governor Tompkins on the subject of aiding the revenue\r\nofficers on the Canada line with militia. I refer you on this subject to\r\nmy answer to him, and pray you to encourage strongly his going to the\r\nspot himself, and acting according to the urgencies which will present\r\nthemselves there. Should you have satisfactory evidence of either _mala\r\nfides_ or negligence in Pease, he shall be removed without ceremony. I do\r\nnot know the residence of Greene of Massachusetts. The opinion you have\r\ngiven in the case stated by Ellery is certainly correct. No civil officer\r\nof the States can take cognizance of a federal case. Considering our\r\ndetermination to let no more vessels go so far as the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nI see nothing in the case of the brig Resolution, Craycroft, to justify a\r\nchange of the rule, and therefore cannot consent to a vessel's being sent\r\nthere. The case of the Chinese Mandarin is so entirely distinct, that it\r\ncan give no ground for this claim. The opportunity hoped from that, of\r\nmaking known through one of its own characters of note, our nation, our\r\ncircumstances and character, and of letting that government understand at\r\nlength the difference between us and the English, and separate us in its\r\npolicy, rendered that measure a diplomatic one in my view, and likely to\r\nbring lasting advantage to our merchants and commerce with that country.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the rough draught of a letter I have written to Governor\r\nSullivan, in answer to two of his. It was done on consultation with Mr.\r\nMadison.\r\n\r\nI informed you in mine of the 11th that I had directed a commission for\r\nGeneral Steele as successor to Shee. This was certainly according to what\r\nhad been agreed upon at Washington, the event of Shee's death being then\r\nforeseen and made the subject of consultation with yourself, Mr. Rodney,\r\nand, I believe, Mr. Madison. The call for the militia from all the States\r\nhaving been agreed on in April, I have taken for granted it was going on.\r\nI will look to it, as also to the fortifications of New York. I salute you\r\nwith affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 16, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--General Dearborne being on a visit to the province of Maine,\r\nyour letter to him (the date not recollected) was sent to me from his\r\noffice, and, after perusal, was forwarded to him. As the case of the\r\nfive Alabamas, under prosecution for the murder of a white man, may not\r\nadmit delay, if a conviction takes place, I have thought it necessary\r\nto recommend to you in that case to select the leader, or most guilty,\r\nfor execution, and to reprieve the others till a copy of the judgment\r\ncan be forwarded, and a pardon sent you; in the meantime letting them\r\nreturn to their friends, with whom you will of course take just merit for\r\nthis clemency, our wish being merely to make them sensible by the just\r\npunishment of one, that our citizens are not to be murdered or robbed with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nI have learnt with real mortification that the engineers successively\r\nappointed, have withdrawn from their undertaking to carry on the defensive\r\nworks of New Orleans. It is more regretted as capable persons in that line\r\nare more difficult to be got, and it takes so long for the information to\r\ncome here, and the place to be supplied. Two other persons applied to here\r\nhave declined going. Whether General Dearborne has at length been able to\r\nengage one I am not informed. I fear that these disappointments will lose\r\nus the season in a work which more than any other it was my desire to have\r\nhad completed this year. Certainly these losses of time shall be shortened\r\nby us as far as is in our power. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of August 3d, which ought to have been here on the 8th,\r\nwas not received till yesterday. It has loitered somewhere, therefore,\r\nten days, during which three mails have been received. I proceed to its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n_Somes's case._ The rule agreed to at our meeting of June 30th was\r\ngeneral, that no permissions should be granted for Europe, Asia, or\r\nAfrica, and there is nothing in Somes's case to entitle it to exemption\r\nfrom the rule, more than will be found in every case that shall occur;\r\nas a precedent then, it would be a repeal of the rule, and in fact of\r\nthe embargo law. He might have sent his proofs to Malta through England,\r\neither by the British packets or by our avisos. If he has not done it,\r\nand cannot now do it, it is his fault; the permission therefore must be\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n_Coquerel's case._ 1. The question whether he had a right to expect a\r\npermit is against him. None in writing was given; no note or memorandum on\r\nany paper is found warranting the fact, nor is there even any trace of it\r\nin the memory of the collector. On what evidence then does it rest? Merely\r\non the words of the owner and captain that the language of the collector\r\nconveyed an impression on them that they were to have a permit: but we\r\nwell know where this sort of evidence would land us.\r\n\r\n2d. But suppose we had had a positive or written permission, why was it\r\nnot used? Could it be believed to be good for this year, next year, or\r\nten years hence? The reason of the thing must have shown to every one\r\nthat it was good _under existing circumstances_ only, and might become\r\nnull if not used till these were changed. But the written notification of\r\nAugust 1st, giving a final day, annuls all permits after that day; and not\r\na single circumstance is stated which entitles them to a prolongation of\r\nthe time, which would not entitle every other, and consequently repeal the\r\nlimitation of time and the law. I see no ground, therefore, for relieving\r\nhim from the operation of the rule.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter from a Mr. Ithomel to the Secretary of the Navy.\r\nI know not who he is, perhaps an officer of the navy. This is the second\r\nletter he has written, expressing his belief that there is ground to\r\napprehend insurgency in Massachusetts. Neither do I know his politics,\r\nwhich might also be a key to his apprehensions. That the federalists\r\nmay attempt insurrection is possible, and also that the governor would\r\nsink before it. But the republican part of the State, and that portion\r\nof the federalists who approve the embargo in their judgments, and at\r\nany rate would not court mob-law, would crush it in embryo. I have some\r\ntime ago written to General Dearborne to be on the alert on such an\r\noccasion, and to take direction of the public authority on the spot. Such\r\nan incident will rally the whole body of republicans of every shade to a\r\nsingle point,--that of supporting the public authority. Be so good as to\r\nreturn the letter to Mr. Smith. He informs me he has left to yourself and\r\nCommander Rogers to order whatever gun-boats you think can be spared from\r\nNew York to aid the embargo law. If enough be left there or near there, to\r\npreserve order in the harbor, or to drive out a single ship of force, it\r\nwould be sufficient in the present tranquil state of things.\r\n\r\nThe principle of our indulgence of vessels to foreign ministers was, that\r\nit was fair to let them send away all their subjects caught here by the\r\nembargo, and who had no other means of getting away.\r\n\r\nGeneral Turreau says there are fifteen hundred French sailors,--deserters,\r\nhere, many of whom wish to go home. I have desired Mr. Madison to inform\r\nhim that the tonnage permitted must be proportioned to the numbers,\r\naccording to the rules in transport service. On this ground, I do not know\r\nthat we can do wrong. We have nothing yet from Pinckney or Armstrong. But\r\nthe first letter from the former must be so. I salute you with affection\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a letter of July 1st, from Governor Lewis,\r\nreceived from the War Office by the last post. It presents a full, and\r\nnot a pleasant, view of our Indian affairs west of the Mississippi.\r\nAs the punishment of the Osages has been thought necessary, the means\r\nemployed appear judicious. First, to draw off the friendly part of the\r\nnation, and then, withdrawing the protection of the United States, leave\r\nthe other tribes free to take their own satisfaction of them for their\r\nown wrongs. I think we may go further, without actually joining in the\r\nattack. The greatest obstacle to the Indians acting in large bodies,\r\nbeing the difficulty of getting provisions, we might supply them, and\r\nammunition also, if necessary. I hope the Governor will be able to settle\r\nwith the Sacs and Foxes without war, to which, however, he seems too much\r\ncommitted. If we had gone to war for every hunter or trader killed, and\r\nmurderer refused, we should have had general and constant war. The process\r\nto be followed, in my opinion, when a murder has been committed, is first\r\nto demand the murderer, and not regarding a first refusal to deliver,\r\ngive time and press it. If perseveringly refused, recall all traders,\r\nand interdict commerce with them, until he be delivered. I believe this\r\nwould rarely fail in producing the effect desired; and we have seen\r\nthat, by steadily following this line, the tribes become satisfied of our\r\nmoderation, justice, and friendship to them, and become firmly attached\r\nto us. The want of time to produce these dispositions in the Indians west\r\nof the Mississippi, has been the cause of the Kanzas, the Republican,\r\nthe Great and the Wolf Panis, the Matas, and Poncaras, adhering to\r\nthe Spanish interest against us. But if we use forbearance, and open\r\ncommerce for them, they will come to, and give us time to attach them\r\nto us. In the meantime, to secure our frontiers against their hostility,\r\nI would allow Governor Lewis the three companies of spies, and military\r\nstores he desires. We are so distant, and he so well acquainted with the\r\nbusiness, that it is safest for our citizens there and for ourselves,\r\nafter enjoining him to pursue our principles, to permit him to select the\r\nmeans. The factories proposed on the Missouri and Mississippi, as soon\r\nas they can be in activity, will have more effect than as many armies.\r\nIt is on their interests we must rely for their friendship, and not on\r\ntheir fears. With the establishment of these factories, we must prohibit\r\nthe British from appearing westward of the Mississippi, and southward\r\nof logarithm degree; we must break up all their factories on this side\r\nthe Mississippi, west of Lake Michigan; not permit them to send out\r\nindividual traders to the Indian towns, but require all their commerce to\r\nbe carried on at their factories,--putting our own commerce under the same\r\nregulations, which will take away all ground of complaint. In like manner,\r\nI think well of Governor Lewis' proposition to carry on all our commerce\r\nwest of the Mississippi, at fixed points; licensing none but stationary\r\ntraders residing at these points; and obliging the Indians to come to the\r\ncommerce, instead of sending it to them. Having taken this general view\r\nof the subject, which I know is nearly conformable to your own, I leave\r\nto yourself the detailed answer to Governor Lewis, and salute you with\r\nconstant affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 21, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter to General Dearborne, of July 1st, was not received\r\nat the War Office till a few days ago, was forwarded to me, and after\r\nperusal sent on to General Dearborne, at present in Maine. As his official\r\nanswer will be late in getting to you, I have thought it best, in the\r\nmeantime, to communicate to yourself, directly, ideas in conformity with\r\nthose I have expressed to him, and with the principles on which we have\r\nconducted Indian affairs. I regret that it has been found necessary to\r\ncome to open rupture with the Osages, but, being so, I approve of the\r\ncourse you have pursued,--that of drawing off the friendly part of the\r\nnation,--withdrawing from the rest the protection of the United States,\r\nand permitting the other nations to take their own satisfaction for the\r\nwrongs they complain of. I have stated to General Dearborne that I think\r\nwe may go further, and as the principal obstacle to the Indians acting in\r\nlarge bodies, is the want of provisions, we might supply that want, and\r\nammunition also, if they need it. With the Sacs and Foxes I hope you will\r\nbe able to settle amicably, as nothing ought more to be avoided than the\r\nembarking ourselves in a system of military coercion on the Indians. If\r\nwe do this, we shall have general and perpetual war. When a murder has\r\nbeen committed on one of our stragglers, the murderer should be demanded.\r\nIf not delivered, give time, and still press the demand. We find it\r\ndifficult, with our regular government, to take and punish a murderer\r\nof an Indian. Indeed, I believe we have never been able to do it in a\r\nsingle instance. They have their difficulties also, and require time. In\r\nfact, it is a case where indulgence on both sides is just and necessary,\r\nto prevent the two nations from being perpetually committed in war, by\r\nthe acts of the most vagabond and ungovernable of their members. When\r\nthe refusal to deliver the murderer is permanent, and proceeds from the\r\nwant of will, and not of ability, we should then interdict all trade and\r\nintercourse with them till they give us complete satisfaction. Commerce is\r\nthe great engine by which we are to coerce them, and not war. I know this\r\nwill be less effectual on this side the Mississippi, where they can have\r\nrecourse to the British; but this will not be a long-lived evil. By this\r\nforbearing conduct towards the Mississippian Indians for seven years past,\r\nthey are become satisfied of our justice and moderation towards them, that\r\nwe have no desire of injuring them, but, on the contrary, of doing them\r\nall the good offices we can, and they are become sincerely attached to\r\nus; and this disposition, beginning with the nearest, has spread and is\r\nspreading itself to the more remote, as fast as they have opportunities\r\nof understanding our conduct. The Sacs and Foxes, being distant, have\r\nnot yet come over to us. But they are on the balance. Those on this side\r\nthe Mississippi, will soon be entirely with us, if we pursue our course\r\nsteadily. The Osages, Kanzas, the Republican, Great and Wolf Panis, Matas,\r\nPoncaras, &c., who are inclined to the Spaniards, have not yet had time\r\nto know our dispositions. But if we use forbearance, and open commerce\r\nwith them, they will come to, and give us time to attach them to us. In\r\nthe meantime, to secure our frontiers, I have expressed myself to General\r\nDearborne in favor of the three companies of spies, and the military\r\nsupplies you ask for. So, also, in the having established factories, at\r\nwhich all the traders shall be stationary, allowing none to be itinerant,\r\nfurther than indispensable circumstances shall require. As soon as our\r\nfactories on the Missouri and Mississippi can be in activity, they will\r\nhave more powerful effects than so many armies. With respect to the\r\nBritish, we shall take effectual steps to put an immediate stop to their\r\ncrossing the Mississippi, by the severest measures. And I have proposed\r\nto General Dearborne to break up all their factories within our limits on\r\nthis side the Mississippi, to let them have them only at fixed points, and\r\nsuppress all itinerant traders of theirs, as well as our own. They have,\r\nby treaty, only an equal right of commerce with ourselves, the regulations\r\nof which on our side of the line belongs to us, as that on their side\r\nbelongs to them. All that can be required is that these regulations be\r\nequal. These are the general views which, on the occasion of your letter,\r\nI have expressed to General Dearborne. I reserve myself for consultation\r\nwith him, and shall be very glad to receive your sentiments also on the\r\nseveral parts of them, after which we may decide on the modifications\r\nwhich may be approved. In the meantime you will probably receive from him\r\nan answer to your letter, till which this communication of my sentiments\r\nmay be of some aid in determining your own course of proceeding.\r\n\r\nYour friends here are all well, except Colonel Lewis, who has declined\r\nvery rapidly the last few months. He scarcely walks about now, and\r\nnever beyond his yard. We can never lose a better man. I salute you with\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 22, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--You are not unapprized that in order to check the evasions of\r\nthe embargo laws effected under color of the coasting trade, we found\r\nit necessary to prevent the transportation of flour coast-wise, except\r\nto the States not making enough for their own consumption, and that to\r\nplace the supplies of these States under some check, a discretionary\r\npower was given to the Governors to give licenses to the amount of what\r\nthey deemed the necessary importation. By a subsequent regulation, the\r\ncollectors were advised not to detain suspicious vessels, the articles\r\nof whose cargoes were so proportioned as not to excite suspicion of\r\nfraudulent intentions; and particularly where not more than one-eight in\r\nvalue was provisions. This last regulation has operated so well that in\r\nthe other importing States (Massachusetts excepted) little or no use has\r\nbeen made of the power of giving special licenses. But the licenses of\r\nMassachusetts, in the first two months, having amounted to 60,000 barrels\r\nof flour, the quantity was so much beyond their consumption, that it was\r\nsuspected the licenses were fraudulently perverted to cover exportation.\r\nI therefore requested Governor Sullivan to discontinue issuing them, as,\r\nif the whole quantity was landed and retained in the State, it could not\r\nwant for some time, and if exported, it showed we ought to guard that\r\navenue to fraud. He apprized me, however, by letter, of circumstances\r\nwhich induced him to continue a moderated issue of licenses till he\r\ncould hear from me, and I approved of his doing so till he should leave\r\nthe capital, which he informed me he should do in the fall, when, if the\r\npower were to be continued, he wished it to be put into other hands, as\r\nhis absence would prevent his exercising it. On this ground the matter\r\nnow rests. He supposes that about ninety thousand persons in the State\r\nsubsist on imported flour, which, at a pound a day, would require between\r\nthirteen and fourteen thousand barrels a month. Certainly it is not my\r\nwish that the want of a single individual should be unsupplied a single\r\nday; and I presume the well-affected citizens of Massachusetts would not\r\nwish, by importing a superfluous stock, to open a door for defeating a\r\nlaw judged by the national authorities necessary for the public good, and\r\ncheerfully submitted to elsewhere in the union. The question is, whether,\r\nafter so great importations, the permission to all coasting vessels to\r\ntake one-eight in provisions will not supply the State? On this subject\r\nI ask your friendly information. If it will not, then I must request\r\nyour undertaking to issue licenses, on the departure of the Governor,\r\nto such characters as you may not suspect would make a fraudulent use of\r\nthem. The power will, with propriety, devolve on you, on the Governor's\r\ndeclining it. You stand next in the confidence of the State, and certainly\r\nsecond to no one in my confidence. I will therefore ask from you a full\r\ncommunication of facts, and your opinions on this subject, with an entire\r\ndisposition on my part to do whatever, consistently with my duty, I can\r\ndo to obviate difficulties. I pray you to be assured of my constant esteem\r\nand attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My letter of August 21st being gone to the post-office, I write\r\nthis as a supplement, which will be in time to go by the same post. Isham\r\nLewis arrived here last night and tells me he was with you at St. Louis\r\nabout the second week in July, and consequently, after your letter of the\r\n1st of that month, that four Iowas had been delivered up to you as guilty\r\nof the murder which had been charged to the Sacs and Foxes, and that\r\nyou supposed three of them would be hung. It is this latter matter which\r\ninduces me to write again.\r\n\r\nAs there was but one white murdered by them, I should be averse to the\r\nexecution of more than one of them, selecting the most guilty and worst\r\ncharacter. Nothing but extreme criminality should induce the execution of\r\na second, and nothing beyond that. Besides their idea that justice allows\r\nonly man for man that all beyond that is new aggression, which must be\r\nexpiated by a new sacrifice of an equivalent number of our people, it\r\nis our great object to impress them with a firm persuasion that all our\r\ndispositions towards them are fatherly; that if we take man for man, it\r\nis not from a thirst for blood or revenge, but as the smallest measure\r\nnecessary to correct the evil, and that though all concerned are guilty,\r\nand have forfeited their lives by our usages, we do not wish to spill\r\ntheir blood as long as there can be a hope of their future good conduct.\r\nWe may make a merit of restoring the others to their friends and their\r\nnation, and furnish a motive for obtaining a sincere attachment. There\r\nis the more reason for this moderation, as we know we cannot punish any\r\nmurder which shall be committed by us on them. Even if the murderer can\r\nbe taken, our juries have never yet convicted the murderer of an Indian.\r\nShould these Indians be convicted, I would wish you to deliver up to their\r\nfriends at once, those whom you select for pardon, and not to detain them\r\nin confinement until a pardon can be actually sent you. That shall be\r\nforwarded to you as soon as you shall send me a copy of the judgment on\r\nwhich it shall be founded.\r\n\r\nI am uneasy hearing nothing from you about the Mandan chief, nor the\r\nmeasures for restoring him to his country. That is an object which presses\r\non our justice and our honor, and further than that I suppose a severe\r\npunishment of the Ricaras indispensable, taking for it our own time\r\nand convenience. My letter from Washington asked your opinions on this\r\nsubject. I repeat my salutations of affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 25, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my letter of the 15th I informed you that I had authorized\r\nGovernor Tompkins to order out such aids of militia on Lake Ontario and\r\nthe Canada line, as he should find necessary to enforce the embargo, not\r\nexceeding five hundred, he proposing to repair thither himself to select\r\ntrusty persons. I am now to request that you will have measures taken for\r\ntheir pay, subsistence, and whatever else is requisite.\r\n\r\nI enclose you applications for military command in favor of John B.\r\nLivingston and John Murphy, a letter from Governor Hull, and one from\r\nHowell Hern, who seems to have just cause of complaint against Captain\r\nArmistead; and I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 26, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 17th was received only yesterday. It ought to have\r\ncome by the preceding post. I mention the delay of your letters, as you\r\nmay perhaps know how it happens.\r\n\r\n_Smissaert's Case._\r\n\r\nThe exportation of these doits was refused before, and I see no reason for\r\na change of opinion. They are understood to be private property. If they\r\nwere public, we might on a principle of comity permit their exportation\r\nin their own or any other foreign vessel. But comity does not require\r\nus to send our ships and seamen into the mouths of captors. I am not\r\nsufficiently informed of the conduct of the Batavian government towards\r\nour vessels at present, to derive any motive from that to affect the\r\npresent case.\r\n\r\nKettridge's letter, with yours to him and Blake, and Burt's letter, are\r\nnow returned. I am in hopes the successes of our armed vessels will check\r\nthe evasions of the embargo. I have received no letter from Governor\r\nTompkins since that of the 9th, my answer to which, of the 15th, contained\r\nassurances which would fully meet any case of militia ordered out by\r\nhim under five hundred, as to our answering the expense. I will write\r\nimmediately to General Dearborne to provide pay and subsistence, and\r\nwill send it open to his chief clerk at Washington, with instructions to\r\nhim to take order in it immediately, to prevent the delay from General\r\nDearborne's absence. I will also write to General Wilkinson to forward\r\nthe recruits of New York to the positions you have named. Your circular\r\nfor the North Carolina navigation, and the papers concerning the Mandarin,\r\nare not yet received. Astor's publication in the Aurora has sufficiently\r\nquieted me on that head. * * * * *\r\n\r\nP. S. No letter yet from Mr. Pinckney.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN M'GREGOR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 26, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In answer to the petition which you delivered me from the officers\r\nof merchant vessels belonging to Philadelphia, I must premise my sincere\r\nregret at the sacrifices which our fellow citizens generally, and the\r\npetitioners in particular, have been obliged to meet by the circumstances\r\nof the times. We live in an age of affliction, to which the history of\r\nnations presents no parallel. We have for years been looking on Europe\r\ncovered with blood and violence, and seen rapine spreading itself over\r\nthe ocean. On this element it has reached us, and at length in so serious\r\na degree, that the Legislature of the nation has thought it necessary to\r\nwithdraw our citizens and property from it, either to avoid, or to prepare\r\nfor engaging in the general contest. But for this timely precaution,\r\nthe petitioners and their property might now have been in the hands of\r\nspoilers, who have laid aside all regard to moral right. Withdrawing\r\nfrom the greater evil, a lesser one has been necessarily encountered. And\r\ncertainly, could the Legislature have made provision against this also, I\r\nshould have had great pleasure as the instrument of its execution, but it\r\nwas impracticable, by any general and just rules, to prescribe in every\r\ncase the best resource against the inconveniences of this new situation.\r\nThe difficulties of the crisis will certainly fall with greater pressure\r\non some descriptions of citizens than on others; and on none perhaps with\r\ngreater than our seafaring brethren. Should any means of alleviation\r\noccur within the range of my duties, I shall with certainty advert to\r\nthe situation of the petitioners, and, in availing the nation of their\r\nservices, aid them with a substitute for their former occupations. I\r\nsalute them and yourself with sentiments of sincere regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my letter of yesterday I omitted to enclose that of Hern,\r\nwhich I now do. I add to it a newspaper from St. Louis, in which is an\r\naccount of the surrender of some Indian murderers. This paper says there\r\nwere three or four whites murdered. But I think Governor Lewis' letter\r\nsays but one. On that ground I wrote to him to recommend, if they should\r\nbe convicted, to suffer only one to be executed, unless there was strong\r\nreason for doing more, and to deliver up the rest to their friends, as a\r\nproof of our friendship and desire not to injure them. Mr. Woolsey, our\r\nCollector on Champlain, has lately been to Montreal. He took much pains to\r\nfind out the British strength in that quarter, and the following is what\r\nhe says, we may rely on:\r\n\r\n      At Montreal                   450\r\n         Chambly                     80\r\n         St. John's                  40\r\n         Odle Town                   14\r\n         Isle Aux Noix               10\r\n                                   ----\r\n                                    594\r\n\r\nHe adds, that 10,000 men will take the whole country to within a league of\r\nQuebec. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n                                            UNITED STATES, August 29, 1808.\r\n\r\nGREAT AND GOOD FRIEND AND EMPEROR,--Desirous of promoting useful\r\nintercourse and good understanding between your majesty's subjects and the\r\ncitizens of the United States, and especially to cultivate the friendship\r\nof your majesty, I have appointed William Short, one of our distinguished\r\ncitizens, to be in quality of Minister Plenipotentiary of the United\r\nStates, the bearer to you of assurances of their sincere friendship,\r\nand of their desire to maintain with your majesty and your subjects the\r\nstrictest relations of amity and commerce: he will explain to your majesty\r\nthe peculiar position of these States, separated by a wide ocean from the\r\npowers of Europe, with interests and pursuits distinct from theirs, and\r\nconsequently without the motives or the appetites for taking part in the\r\nassociations or oppositions which a different system of interests produces\r\namong them; he is charged to assure your majesty more particularly of our\r\npurpose to observe a faithful neutrality towards the contending powers, in\r\nthe war to which your majesty is a party, rendering to all the services\r\nand courtesies of friendship, and praying for the re-establishment of\r\npeace and right among them; and we entertain an entire confidence that\r\nthis just and faithful conduct on the part of the United States will\r\nstrengthen the friendly dispositions you have manifested towards them, and\r\nbe a fresh motive with so just and magnanimous a sovereign to enforce, by\r\nthe high influence of your example, the respect due to the character and\r\nthe rights of a peaceable nation. I beseech you, great and good friend\r\nand emperor, to give entire credence to whatever he shall say to you on\r\nthe part of these States, and most of all when he shall assure you of\r\ntheir cordial esteem and respect for your majesty's person and character,\r\npraying God always to have you in his safe and holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--The absence of General Dearborne and his great distance\r\nrender it necessary to recommend a measure which should regularly go from\r\nhim, but will not admit of that delay. The armed resistance to the embargo\r\nlaws on the Canada line induced us at an early period to determine that\r\nthe new recruits of the northern States should be rendezvoused there,\r\nand I presume you received such instructions from General Dearborne. In\r\nthe meantime we have been obliged to make several detachments of militia\r\nto points on that line. This is irksome to them, expensive, troublesome,\r\nand less efficacious. Understanding that there are three companies of new\r\nrecruits filled, or nearly filled, at New York, I must pray you to order\r\nthese, and indeed all the recruits of the State of New York, to Sackett's\r\nHarbor, Oswegatchie, and Plattsburgh, in equal proportions to each, in\r\norder to support the collectors in the execution of their duties, and this\r\nwithout any avoidable delay, giving notice to Governor Tompkins of their\r\nmarch and time of probable arrival at their destination, that he may give\r\ncorresponding orders respecting the relief of the militia. I salute you\r\nwith esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,-- * * * * * Mr. Madison and myself on repeated consultations,\r\n(and some of the other members of the executive expressed the same\r\nopinion before they left Washington,) have concluded that the mission to\r\nPetersburgh should not be delayed. Being special, and not permanent, the\r\nwaiting the meeting of the Senate is less important, and, if we waited,\r\nthat it could not go till spring, and we know not what this summer and\r\nthe ensuing winter may produce. We think secrecy also important, and\r\nthat the mission should be as little known as possible, till it is in\r\nPetersburgh, which could not be, if known to the Senate. Mr. Short goes\r\ntherefore in the aviso from Philadelphia, to be engaged for September\r\n15th. He is peculiarly distressed by sickness at sea, and of course more\r\nso the smaller the vessel. I think, therefore, the occasion justifies the\r\nenlargement of our vessel somewhat beyond what might be necessary for\r\na mere aviso. The season, too, by the time of her return, might render\r\nit desirable for safety, which circumstance may be mentioned in your\r\ninstructions to the collector, to prevent his suspicions of the real\r\nground. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 5, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The last post brought me the counter addresses now enclosed.\r\nThat from Ipswich is signed by about forty persons; the town meeting\r\nwhich voted the petition consisted of thirty. There are 500 voters in the\r\nplace. The counter address of Boston has 700 signatures. The town meeting\r\nvoting the petition is said to have consisted of 500. In the draught of an\r\nanswer enclosed, I have taken the occasion of making some supplementary\r\nobservations which could not with propriety have been inserted in the\r\nanswers to the petitions. The object is that the two together may present\r\nto our own people the strongest points in favor of the embargo in a short\r\nand clear view. An eye is also kept on foreign nations, in some of the\r\nobservations. Be so good as to make it what it should be, and return it by\r\nthe first post. * * * * *\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant and sincere affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 5, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of August 18th is this moment received, and I forward you\r\na letter of July 16th, from Governor Lewis, from which you will perceive\r\nthat the cloud between us, the Iowas, Foxes, and Sacs, is cleared up.\r\nHe says nothing of the Osages; but I presume their enemies have taken\r\nadvantage of the withdrawing our protection from them. Should you not have\r\nissued orders for the 100,000 men, I believe it may rest till we meet in\r\nWashington, under present appearances, that they may not be wanting. Mr.\r\nPinckney, in a letter of June 29th, says, \"I had a long interview this\r\nmorning with Mr. Canning, which has given me hopes that the [3]object\r\nmentioned in your letter of April 30th may be accomplished, if I should\r\nauthorize the expectation which the same [4]letter suggests.\" He adds that\r\nhe waits for the St. Michael, when he will give the result and details.\r\nHe thinks they will also make acceptable satisfaction for the Chesapeake.\r\nProposing to leave this on the 28th, I presume I had better reserve future\r\ncommunications for our meeting at Washington.\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n    [3] Repeal of the orders of council.\r\n\r\n    [4] Repeal of the embargo.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you Pinckney's letter, the complexion of which I like.\r\nIf they repeal their orders, we must repeal our embargo. If they make\r\nsatisfaction for the Chesapeake, we must revoke our proclamation, and\r\ngeneralize its operation by a law. If they keep up impressments, we must\r\nadhere to non-intercourse, manufacturers' and a navigation act. I enclose\r\nfor your perusal a letter of Mr. Short's. I inform him that any one of\r\nthe persons he names would be approved, the government never recognizing a\r\ndifference between the two parties of republicans in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 6, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I avail myself of the last moment allowed by the departure\r\nof the post to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 27th and\r\n31st ult., and to say in answer to the last, that any one of the three\r\npersons you there propose would be approved as to their politics, for\r\nin appointments to office the government refuses to know any difference\r\nbetween descriptions of republicans, all of whom are in principle, and\r\nco-operate, with the government. Biddle we know, and have formed an\r\nexcellent opinion of him. His travelling and exercise in business must\r\nhave given him advantages. I am much pleased with the account you give\r\nof the sentiments of the federalists of Philadelphia as to the embargo,\r\nand that they are not in sentiment with the insurgents of the north. The\r\npapers have lately advanced in boldness and flagitiousness beyond even\r\nthemselves. Such daring and atrocious lies as fill the third and fourth\r\ncolumns of the third page of the United States Gazette of August 31st,\r\nwere never before, I believe, published with impunity in any country.\r\nHowever, I have from the beginning determined to submit myself as the\r\nsubject on whom may be proved the impotency of a free press in a country\r\nlike ours, against those who conduct themselves honestly and enter into no\r\nintrigue. I admit at the same time that restraining the press _to truth_,\r\nas the present laws do, is the only way of making it useful. But I have\r\nthought necessary first to prove it can never be dangerous. Not knowing\r\nwhether I shall have another occasion to address you here, be assured that\r\nmy sincere affections and wishes for your success and happiness accompany\r\nyou everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your two letters of the 2d instant were read yesterday\r\nafternoon, and I now return you Penniman's and Gray's papers, and the\r\nNew Orleans petition. Penniman's conduct deserves marked approbation, and\r\nthere should be no hesitation about the expenses reasonably incurred. If\r\nall these people are convicted, there will be too many to be punished with\r\ndeath. My hope is that they will send me full statements of every man's\r\ncase, that the most guilty may be marked as examples, and the less so\r\nsuffer long imprisonment under reprieves from time to time.\r\n\r\n_Packet between Vermont and Canada._\r\n\r\nI do not think this is a time for opening new channels of intercourse with\r\nCanada, and multiplying the means of smuggling, and am therefore against\r\nthis proposition.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Gray's case._\r\n\r\nHis late rational and patriotic conduct would merit any indulgence\r\nconsistent with our duty; but the reason and the rule against permitting\r\nlong voyages at present, are insurmountable obstacles. It is to be hoped\r\nsome circuitous means of sending his proofs can be found. A vessel may go\r\nfrom England as well as from here.\r\n\r\n_New Orleans Petition._\r\n\r\nYou know I have been averse to letting Atlantic flour go to New Orleans\r\nmerely that they may have the _whitest_ bread possible. Without honoring\r\nthe motives of the petition, it gives us the fact that there is western\r\nflour enough for the New Orleans market. I would therefore discourage\r\nAtlantic cargoes to that place.\r\n\r\nI send you the petition of Thomas Beatty for Samuel Glen, of Londonderry,\r\nfor permission to load a vessel for Ireland. Mr. Beatty met me in the road\r\nin one of my daily rides. I gave his paper a hasty perusal, and, asking\r\ntime for consideration, I told him I would enclose it to you, who would\r\ngive the answer. On a more deliberate reading of it, I see nothing to\r\nexempt it from the general rules, according to which you will be so good\r\nas to dispose of it.\r\n\r\nThe cases from Charleston require consideration, and our regular post\r\ngives me, in fact, but one forenoon to answer letters. I will forward them\r\nto Mr. Theus by our extra post of the 13th.\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SIMEON THEUS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--According to the request of Mr. Gallatin's letter, herewith\r\nenclosed, I have considered the petitions of Grove, Himely, Everingham,\r\nand Ogier & Turner, referred to me by him, and forward you the decisions\r\nfor your government. They are addressed to yourself directly, to avoid\r\nunnecessary delay to the parties, by passing them through him, as\r\nregularly they should have been.\r\n\r\n_Grove's Case._\r\n\r\nAlthough the circular of the 1st of July limited no precise day for the\r\ndeparture of vessels under permits, yet in all such cases, a reasonable\r\ntime only is to be understood, such as using due diligence, will suffice\r\nfor the object. Such regulations can never be deemed but as temporary,\r\nand especially in times when the political circumstances governing them\r\nare liable to daily change. The time between the receipt at Charleston,\r\nof the circulars of July 1st and August 1st, was from the 19th or 20th\r\nof July to the 16th of August,--twenty-seven days; and within this time\r\nMr. Grove states explicitly that he had prepared and cleared out the ship\r\nPierce Manning, for the Havanna, and that she would have sailed before\r\nthe 16th of August but for adverse winds. Considering, therefore, that the\r\nlimitation of departure to the 15th of August was not known at Charleston\r\ntill the 16th, so that not a moment's warning was given of it there, I\r\nthink that, satisfactory proof being exhibited to the collector, that she\r\nwas ready for sailing, or even very nearly ready on the 16th of August.\r\nShe may now be permitted to depart, on condition that she does depart\r\nwithin such time as the state of her preparation, somewhat of course\r\nrelaxed during the suspension, may in the judgment of the collector render\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for originally limiting a day, increased by time require the\r\nexaction of this condition.\r\n\r\n_Himeley's Case._\r\n\r\nThis petition has no date; but it imports to have been written on the\r\nday of the receipt of the circular of August 1st at Charleston, and\r\nconsequently on the 16th of August. It affirms that the brig Three\r\nBrothers, for Matanzas, then had on board the crew and necessary\r\nprovisions, and assigns a probable reason why she could not have been\r\nready sooner. For the reasons, and on the conditions stated in Grove's\r\ncase, (that is to say, on proof of the facts to the collector, and her\r\nprompt departure,) she ought to have a permit.\r\n\r\n_Everingham's Case._\r\n\r\nI put entirely out of sight, as having no bearing on this case, everything\r\nwhich passed prior to the receipt of the circular of July 1st, and\r\nconsider the case as beginning _de novo_ then, and under that circular.\r\nThe petitioner declares expressly that on the publication of that\r\ncircular, (July 20th,) he used every exertion to prepare the ship Diana\r\nfor a voyage to the Havanna, and had _just prepared her_ therefor when\r\nthe circular of August 1st was received. The expression _just prepared_,\r\nis not absolutely definite. It may respect time or degree. It implies,\r\nhowever, that she was _very nearly_, if not quite, prepared. And if the\r\ncollector receives satisfactory proof that he was _nearly prepared_,\r\nalthough she might not be in absolute readiness at the first moment of\r\nreceiving the warning, and on the conditions stated in Grove's case.\r\n\r\nThe case of the schooner James is very different. The petitioner only\r\nstates that he had _applied_ to the collector, and obtained leave prior\r\nto August 1st,--had _begun_ to use exertions, &c., and had _ordered_ her\r\nto be careened and graved, &c., when the circular of August 1st arrived,\r\nto wit, August 16th, twenty-seven days had therefore intervened, and\r\nnothing more than an _order_ given to careen. In the other cases we\r\nhave seen that the twenty-seven days were sufficient to be in a state of\r\nactual readiness, even where a part of the loading was to be sent for from\r\nanother State. No permit, therefore, can be granted in this case.\r\n\r\n_Ogier & Turner's Case._\r\n\r\nThe petitioners state that Ogier had time, after the receipt of the\r\ncircular of July 1st, to _prepare and despatch_ one vessel; but that they\r\nwere only _preparing_ other vessels when the second circular was received,\r\nto wit, August 16th, whereupon the collector refused to let them despatch\r\nthe vessels which they had been _preparing_ as aforesaid. A due diligence\r\nthen having enabled them to despatch one vessel in the twenty-seven days,\r\na like diligence, had it been used, might have despatched others. But from\r\nthe tenor of their petition, the preparations of the others seem to have\r\nbeen merely incipient, and not near completion. They have consequently\r\nlost the claims on that equity which extends relief against rigorous\r\nrules, where due exertions have been used to fulfil them, and have been\r\ndefeated only by accidental and unavoidable want of notice. They are not\r\nentitled to permits in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I send you a letter of Short's for perusal, and one of Edgar\r\nPatterson, asking what is already I presume provided for, and one of\r\nGeneral Armstrong, which I do not well understand, because I do not\r\nrecollect the particular letter which came by Haley. I presume the counsel\r\nhe refers to is to take possession of the Floridas. This letter of June\r\n15th is written after the cession by Carlos to Bonaparte of all his\r\ndominions, when he supposed England would at once pounce on the Floridas\r\nas a prey, or Bonaparte occupy it as a neighbor. His next will be written\r\nafter the people of Spain will have annihilated the cession, England\r\nbecome the protector of Florida, and Bonaparte without title or means to\r\nplant himself there as our neighbor.\r\n\r\nOught I to answer such a petition as that of Rowley? The people have\r\na right to petition, but not to use that right to cover calumniating\r\ninsinuations.\r\n\r\nTurreau writes like Armstrong so much in the buskin, that he cannot give a\r\nnaked fact in an intelligible form. I do not know what it is he asks for.\r\nIf a transport or transports to convey sailors, there has been no refusal;\r\nand if any delay of answer, I presume it can be explained. If he wishes to\r\nbuy vessels here, man them with French seamen, and send them elsewhere,\r\nthe breach of neutrality would be in permitting, not in refusing it.\r\nBut have we permitted this to England? His remedy is easy in every case.\r\nRepeal the decrees. I presume our Fredericksburg rider need not come after\r\nhis next trip. I salute you affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 16, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--You will perceive by the enclosed papers that an aggression has\r\nbeen committed on the Spanish territory by (if I understand the case,)\r\nboth our land and sea officers. I enclose the papers to you that the\r\nnecessary orders may be given in your department, and the papers handed\r\non to the War department that the same may be done there. I suppose it\r\nwill suffice for the present to order the men to be immediately given\r\nup, and the officers given to understand that the conduct of those who\r\ncommitted it will become a subject of consideration for the Cabinet on its\r\nre-assembling at Washington, and that we will not permit aggressions to be\r\ncommitted on our part, against which we remonstrated to Spain on her part.\r\n\r\nI expect to be in Washington on the last day of September, or 1st of\r\nOctober. I salute you with affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 20, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of September 10th and 14th were received yesterday, and\r\nmy time being brief, my answer must be so.\r\n\r\n_Brig Betsey, and the Aurora._\r\n\r\nThe first having put back by stress of weather, and inevitable necessity,\r\nought, I think, to be permitted to sail again; but not to the Aurora,\r\nwhich put back merely because the Captain was a fool. They have lost\r\ntheir chance by their own folly, and have no claim to be excepted out of\r\nthe general rule. If you concur in these opinions be so good as to act on\r\nthem; but if you think differently, let them lie till we meet, which will\r\nprobably be within two or three days after you receive this.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Soderstrom._\r\n\r\nHis application is peremptorily refused, and his lawyer's opinions are\r\nsent to Mr. Madison, that he may be properly reprimanded. For a foreign\r\nagent, addressed to the Executive, to embody himself with the lawyers of\r\na faction whose sole object is to embarrass and defeat all the measures\r\nof the country, and by their opinions, known to be always in opposition,\r\nto endeavor to influence our proceedings is a conduct not to be permitted.\r\nThe government will certainly decide for itself on whose counsel they will\r\nsettle the construction of the laws they are to execute. We are to look\r\nat the intention of the Legislature, and to carry it into execution while\r\nthe lawyers are nibbling at the words of the law. It is well known that on\r\nevery question the lawyers are about equally divided, as is seen in the\r\npresent case, and were we to act but in cases where no contrary opinion\r\nof a lawyer can be had, we should never act. I send White's petition for\r\nbetter information, to be acted on when we meet. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 14, 1808.\r\n\r\nAs we know that Sullivan's licenses have overstocked the wants of\r\nthe eastern States with flour, the proposal to carry more there is of\r\nitself suspicious, and therefore even regular traders ought not to be\r\nallowed. The regular trade was to supply flour for exportation as well as\r\nconsumption. If the rule of the sixth (or eighth, I believe,) is extended\r\nto them, the supply will be kept up sufficiently for consumption. The rule\r\nof the sixth is a good one, because if the vessel goes off, the gain will\r\nnot be more than the loss by forfeiture, which in that case becomes an\r\nefficient penalty. If they wish to take more, it furnishes good grounds of\r\nsuspicion that they mean to pay the forfeitures out of the gains, and to\r\nprofit by the surplus. I should think it ought to be adhered to, and that\r\nthe collectors should consider it as a rule to regulate their discretion,\r\nand to give equal measure in all our posts to all our citizens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT L. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 15, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of September the 22d waited here for my return, and it\r\nis not till now that I have been able to acknowledge it. The explanation\r\nof his principles given you by the French Emperor, in conversation, is\r\ncorrect as far as it goes. He does not wish us to go to war with England,\r\nknowing we have no ships to carry on that war. To submit to pay to England\r\nthe tribute on our commerce which she demands by her orders of council,\r\nwould be to aid her in the war against him, and would give him just\r\nground to declare war with us. He concludes, therefore, as every rational\r\nman must, that the embargo, the only remaining alternative, was a wise\r\nmeasure. These are acknowledged principles, and should circumstances\r\narise which may offer advantage to our country in making them public,\r\nwe shall avail ourselves of them. But as it is not usual nor agreeable\r\nto governments to bring their conversations before the public, I think\r\nit would be well to consider this on your part as confidential, leaving\r\nto the government to retain or make it public, as the general good may\r\nrequire. Had the Emperor gone further, and said that he condemned our\r\nvessels going voluntarily into his ports in breach of his municipal laws,\r\nwe might have admitted it rigorously legal, though not friendly. But his\r\ncondemnation of vessels taken on the high seas, by his privateers, and\r\ncarried involuntarily into his ports, is justifiable by no law, is piracy,\r\nand this is the wrong we complain of against him.\r\n\r\nSupposing that you may be still at Clermont, from whence your letter is\r\ndated, I avail myself of this circumstance to request your presenting my\r\nfriendly respects to Chancellor Livingston. I salute you with esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 16, 1808.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Massey's Commission._--A half-sighted lawyer might, perhaps, say that a\r\ncommission signed with a blank for the name,--afterwards filled up, was\r\na nullity, because, in legal instruments, any change in a material part\r\nof a bond, deed, &c., after sealing and delivery, nullifies it. But I am\r\nnot certain whether there are not cases, even in ordinary transactions\r\nat law, where it is otherwise,--_e. g._, a power of attorney sent to a\r\ndistance, with a blank for the name, a blank commission, a blank subpœna,\r\n&c. But in matters of government, there can be no question but that the\r\ncommission sealed and signed, with a blank for the name, date, place, &c.,\r\nis good; because government can in no country be carried on without it.\r\nThe most vital proceedings of our own government would become null were\r\nsuch a construction to prevail, and the _argumentum ab inconvenienti_,\r\nwhich is one of the great foundations of the law, will undoubtedly sustain\r\nthe practice, and sanction it by the maxim \"_qui facit per alterum, facit\r\nper se_.\" I would not therefore give the countenance of the government to\r\nso impracticable a construction by issuing a new commission. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BLAKE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 17, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--However favorably the enclosed papers represent the case of\r\nAlexander Frost, yet it would be against every rule of prudence for me\r\nto undertake to revise the verdict of a jury on _ex parte_ affidavits and\r\nrecommendations. If the judges and yourself who were present at the trial\r\nthink the defendant a proper object of pardon, I shall be ready, on such\r\na recommendation, to issue it. I ask the favor of your information on this\r\nsubject, and salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nI think that none of the circumstances, preceding the passage of the\r\nembargo law, stated by Mr. Lorent, make any part of his case. The\r\nmisfortunes entering into the preceding history of that property, not\r\nflowing from any act of this government, authorizes no claims on it. The\r\nembargo law excepted from its own operation articles then laden on board\r\na foreign ship, without distinguishing between articles of foreign or\r\nnational property. It subjected to its operation all articles, whether\r\nforeign or national property, not then laden on board any foreign ship.\r\nMr. Lorent's property was not then laden on board of any foreign ship,\r\nis therefore within the words of the law, and as certainly within its\r\npurview. It is not one of those cases which, though within the _words_\r\nof the law, were notoriously not within its intention, and are therefore\r\nrelievable by an equitable exercise of discretionary power. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a petition of the widow Bennet for the liberation of her\r\nson at Boston, a minor, or for a moiety of three months' pay, to enable\r\nher to go to another son. I think when her case was formerly before us,\r\nshe was said to be a woman of ill fame, and that her son did not wish to\r\nreturn to her. Still, however, the mother, if there be no father, is the\r\nnatural guardian, and is legally entitled to the custody and the earnings\r\nof her son. If she were to make her demand legally for both or either,\r\nshe would prevail. May it not be for the benefit of the son and of the\r\nservice, to compromise by paying the sixteen dollars, and taking a regular\r\nrelinquishment or transfer of her rights to the body of her son, and his\r\nearnings in future, so that we may have no more to do with her. This is\r\nreferred to Mr. Smith's consideration. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nIs the case proposed by Mr. Wolcott left by the law at the discretion\r\nof anybody? The law makes it the duty of the Collector to detain if he\r\n_suspects_ an intention to export to a foreign market, _à fortiori_ if\r\nthat intention be _avowed_. It is true that the first step proposed is\r\nonly to go to another district, but declared to be preparatory to an\r\nexportation to the West Indies. It is true also that they say they do not\r\nmean to export until the law is repealed. But ought we under that cover\r\nto facilitate those illegal views which our experience has proved to be\r\nso general? Still, if there be any sound ground on which the permission\r\ncan be given, I would rather make it the subject of consultation with you,\r\nthan to have the present understood to be a final decision. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES MAIN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 10th has been duly received. Certainly I would\r\nwith great pleasure contribute anything in my power to render the\r\nhistory you propose to write a faithful account of the period it will\r\ncomprehend. Nothing is so desirable to me, as that after mankind shall\r\nhave been abused by such gross falsehoods as to events while passing,\r\ntheir minds should at length be set to rights by genuine truth. And I\r\ncan conscientiously declare that as to myself, I wish that not only no\r\nact but no thought of mine should be unknown. But, Sir, my other and more\r\nimperious duties put it out of my power. So totally is my time engrossed\r\nby the public concerns, that for mere want of time, many of them which I\r\nought to attend to myself, if my time sufficed, I am obliged, for want\r\nof it, to refer to others. To withdraw myself from still more of them\r\nfor any voluntary object would be a failure in duty. If you shall think\r\nproper, as you say, to commit to me the perusal of the manuscript before\r\nit goes to the press, I shall then probably be in a private station, and\r\nmaster of my own time, and I will carefully examine, and faithfully offer\r\nany corrections or supplements which I may think will render it a true\r\nrepresentation of events. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN GROVE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your two letters of the 11th inst. have been received, and I am\r\nobliged to observe that so wholly do the indispensable duties of my\r\noffice engross my whole time, that I could not give a deliberate reading\r\nto two letters so voluminous as these, and not relating to my particular\r\nfunctions, without withdrawing time from objects having stricter claims\r\non me. I have run over them hastily, and perceive that you are still\r\nengaged in the pursuit of the method of finding the longitude at sea\r\nby an observation of Jupiter and his satellites, brought to the horizon\r\nby a double reflection, as in Hadley's quadrant. That you have written\r\na play to raise funds for prosecuting this, and wish me to circulate a\r\nsubscription for it and print your letters. I will willingly subscribe\r\nmyself for a number of copies to help you, but I have never permitted\r\nmyself to be the circulator of any subscription, or to have agency in\r\nprinting anything, conceiving it improper in my present office. And\r\nhowever wishful of your success in raising funds, I confess I should think\r\nthem better applied to the comfort of your family. After so many better\r\nopinions it may be superfluous to offer mine. Yet justified by my friendly\r\nmotives in doing so, I will observe, that to get the longitude at sea\r\nby observation of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, two desiderata\r\nare wanting: 1st, a practicable way of keeping the planet and satellite\r\nin the field of a glass magnifying sufficiently to show the satellites;\r\n2d, a time-piece which will give the instant of time with sufficient\r\naccuracy to be useful. The bringing the planet and satellite to the\r\nhorizon does not sensibly facilitate the observation, because the planet\r\nin his ascending and descending course is at such heights as admit the\r\ndirect observation with entire convenience. On the other hand, so much\r\nlight is lost by the double reflection as to dim the objects and lessen\r\nthe precision with which the moment of ingress and egress may be marked.\r\nThis double reflection also introduces a new source of error from the\r\ninaccuracy of the instrument; 2d, the desideratum of a time-piece which,\r\nnotwithstanding the motion of the ship, shall keep time during a whole\r\nvoyage with sufficient accuracy for these observations, has not yet been\r\nsupplied. Fine time-keepers have been invented, but not equal to what is\r\nrequisite, all of them deriving their motion from a spring, and not from\r\na pendulum. Indeed these pursuits have lost much of their consequence\r\nsince the improvement of the lunar tables has given the motion of the moon\r\nso accurately, as to make that a foundation for estimating the longitude\r\nby her relative position at a given moment with the sun or fixed stars.\r\nEvery captain of a ship now understands the method of taking these lunar\r\nobservations, and of calculating his longitude by them.\r\n\r\nI have gone into these details with the most friendly view of dissuading\r\nyou from wasting time, which you represent as so much needed for your\r\nfamily, in a pursuit which has baffled every human endeavor as yet, and\r\nhas lost so much of its importance. I return you your letters, because\r\nyou wish to have them published, and conclude with my best wishes for\r\nthe success of your endeavors to raise the funds you desire, and for the\r\napplication of them which shall be best for yourself and your family.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 21, 1808.\r\n\r\n_The case of the Martinique Petitioners._\r\n\r\nI think it wrong to detain foreigners caught here by the embargo; but in\r\npermitting them to take our vessels to return in, we do what is a matter\r\nof favor, not of right. Of course we can restrict them to a tonnage\r\nproportioned to their numbers. In the transport service I believe the\r\nallowance is two tons to every person. We may allow a little more room;\r\nbut there ought to be an end to this, and I think it high time to put an\r\nend to it. What would you think of advertising that after a certain day,\r\nno American vessel will be permitted to go out for the purpose of carrying\r\npersons. Perhaps this should be communicated by the Secretary of State to\r\nthe foreign ministers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFronda states that a proprietor of Amelia Island, in Florida, shipped his\r\ncrop for a foreign port on board an American vessel. The vessel was taken\r\nby the Argus, carried into Savannah, and condemned for a breach of the\r\nembargo laws; the cargo pronounced clear. Probably the vessel had left our\r\nharbors without a clearance, though that is not stated, nor the cause of\r\nher condemnation specified. Permission is asked to send away the cargo. If\r\nthe Spanish proprietor had no agency in drawing the vessel away contrary\r\nto the embargo laws, his employment of her was innocent, and he ought to\r\nbe permitted to send his cargo out; because for us to take his property\r\nand bring it in by force, and against his will, and then to detain it\r\nunder pretext of an embargo, would be equivalent to piracy or war. A\r\nvessel driven involuntarily into a port by weather, or an enemy, with\r\nprohibited goods, is always allowed to depart, and even to sell as much\r\nof the goods as will make the vessel sea-worthy, if disabled. I do not\r\nknow, however, that in the present case we are bound to do any more than\r\nlet one of our vessels be engaged to replace the cargo in Amelia Island,\r\nand certainly we ought not to let it go to any distant port; but if the\r\nproprietor enticed or engaged the vessel to break the embargo law, he was\r\n_particeps criminis_, and must submit to the loss which he has brought\r\non himself. I send you Fronda's note, which should be returned to Mr.\r\nMadison, with information of the order you shall give for inquiring into\r\nthe facts, and permission or refusal as they shall turn out. Affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS COOPER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--When I received your letter of the 16th, I thought I had not\r\na copy of my report on measures, weights, and coins, except one bound up\r\nin a volume with other reports; but on carefully searching a bundle of\r\nduplicates, I found the one I now enclose you, being the only detached\r\none I possess. It is defective in one article. The report was composed\r\nunder a severe attack of periodical headache, which came on every day at\r\nsunrise, and never left me till sunset. What had been ruminated in the day\r\nunder a paroxysm of the most excruciating pain, was committed to paper by\r\ncandlelight, and then the calculations were made. After delivering in the\r\nreport, it was discovered that in calculating the money unit § 5 page 49,\r\nthere was a small error in the third or fourth column of decimals, the\r\ncorrection of which however brought the proposed unit still nearer to the\r\nestablished one. I reported the correction in a single leaf to Congress.\r\nThe copy I send you has not that leaf.\r\n\r\nThe first question to be decided is between those who are for units of\r\nmeasures, weights, and coins, having, a known relation to something in\r\nnature of fixed dimension, and those who are for an arbitrary standard.\r\nOn this \"dice vexata quaestio\" it is useless to say a word, every one\r\nhaving made up his mind on a view of all that can be said. Mr. Dorsey\r\nwas so kind as to send me his pamphlet, by which I found he was for the\r\narbitrary standard of one-third of the standard yard of H. G. of England,\r\nsupposed to be in the Exchequer of that nation, a fac simile of which was\r\nto be procured and lodged in Philadelphia. I confess myself to be of the\r\nother sect, and to prefer an unit bearing a given relation to some fixed\r\nsubject of nature, and of preference to the pendulum, because it may be\r\nin the possession of every man, so that he may verify his measures for\r\nhimself. You will observe that I proposed alternative plans to Congress,\r\nthat they might take the one or the other, according to the degree of\r\ncourage they felt. The first is from page 18 to 38; the second from page\r\n39 to 44. Were I now to decide, it would be in favor of the first, with\r\nthis single addition, that each of the denominations there adopted, should\r\nbe divisible decimally at the will of every individual. The iron-founder\r\ndeals in tons; let him take the ton for his unit, and divide it into\r\n10ths, 100ths, and 1000ths. The dry-goods merchant deals in pounds and\r\nyards; let him divide them decimally. The land-measurer deals in miles and\r\npoles; divide them decimally, only noting over his figures what the unit\r\nis, thus:\r\n\r\n        Tons.   Lbs.    Yds.    Miles.\r\n      18.943, 18.943, 1.8943, 189.43, &c.\r\n\r\nI have lately had a proof how familiar this division into dimes, cents,\r\nand mills, is to the people when transferred from their money to anything\r\nelse. I have an odometer fixed to my carriage, which gives the distances\r\nin miles, dimes, and cents. The people on the road inquire with curiosity\r\nwhat exact distance I have found from such a place to such a place; I\r\nanswer, so many miles, so many cents. I find they universally and at once\r\nform a perfect idea of the relation of the cent to the mile as an unit.\r\nThey would do the same as to yards of cloth, pounds of shot, ounces of\r\nsilver, or of medicine. I believe, therefore, they are susceptible of this\r\ndegree of approximation to a standard rigorously philosophical; beyond\r\nthis I might doubt. However, on this too every one has an opinion, and\r\nI am open to compromise, as I am also to other plans of reformation, of\r\nwhich multitudes have been published. I can conclude, therefore, candidly\r\nwith the \"si quid novisti rectius,\" &c., and sincerely with assurances of\r\nmy constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--You will wonder that your letter of June the 3d should not be\r\nacknowledged till this date. I never received it till September the 12th,\r\nand coming soon after to this place, the accumulation of business I found\r\nhere has prevented my taking it up till now. That you ever participated\r\nin any plan for a division of the Union, I never for one moment believed.\r\nI knew your Americanism too well. But as the enterprise against Mexico\r\nwas of a very different character, I had supposed what I heard on that\r\nsubject to be possible. You disavow it; that is enough for me, and I\r\nforever dismiss the idea. I wish it were possible to extend my belief of\r\ninnocence to a very different description of men in New Orleans; but I\r\nthink there is sufficient evidence of there being there a set of foreign\r\nadventurers, and native malcontents, who would concur in any enterprise\r\nto separate that country from this. I did wish to see these people get\r\nwhat they deserved; and under the maxim of the law itself, that _inter\r\narma silent leges_, that in an encampment expecting daily attack from a\r\npowerful enemy, self-preservation is paramount to all law, I expected\r\nthat instead of invoking the forms of the law to cover traitors, all\r\ngood citizens would have concurred in securing them. Should we have ever\r\ngained our Revolution, if we had bound our hands by manacles of the law,\r\nnot only in the beginning, but in any part of the revolutionary conflict?\r\nThere are extreme cases where the laws become inadequate even to their own\r\npreservation, and where the universal resource is a dictator, or martial\r\nlaw. Was New Orleans in that situation? Although we knew here that the\r\nforce destined against it was suppressed on the Ohio, yet we supposed this\r\nunknown at New Orleans at the time that Burr's accomplices were calling in\r\nthe aid of the law to enable them to perpetrate its suppression, and that\r\nit was reasonable, according to the state of information there, to act on\r\nthe expectation of a daily attack. Of this you are the best judge.\r\n\r\nBurr is in London, and is giving out to his friends that that government\r\noffers him two millions of dollars the moment he can raise an ensign of\r\nrebellion as big as a handkerchief. Some of his partisans will believe\r\nthis, because they wish it. But those who know him best will not believe\r\nit the more because he says it. For myself, even in his most flattering\r\nperiods of the conspiracy, I never entertained one moment's fear. My long\r\nand intimate knowledge of my countrymen, satisfied and satisfies me, that\r\nlet there ever be occasion to display the banners of the law, and the\r\nworld will see how few and pitiful are those who shall array themselves in\r\nopposition. I as little fear foreign invasion. I have indeed thought it a\r\nduty to be prepared to meet even the most powerful, that of a Bonaparte,\r\nfor instance, by the only means competent, that of a classification of the\r\nmilitia, and placing the junior classes at the public disposal; but the\r\nlesson he receives in Spain extirpates all apprehensions from my mind. If\r\nin a peninsula, the neck of which is adjacent to him and at his command,\r\nwhere he can march any army without the possibility of interception\r\nor obstruction from any foreign power, he finds it necessary to begin\r\nwith an army of three hundred thousand men, to subdue a nation of five\r\nmillions, brutalized by ignorance, and enervated by long peace, and should\r\nfind constant reinforcements of thousands after thousands, necessary to\r\neffect at last a conquest as doubtful as deprecated, what numbers would\r\nbe necessary against eight millions of free Americans, spread over such\r\nan extent of country as would wear him down by mere marching, by want\r\nof food, autumnal diseases, &c.? How would they be brought, and how\r\nreinforced across an ocean of three thousand miles, in possession of a\r\nbitter enemy, whose peace, like the repose of a dog, is never more than\r\nmomentary? And for what? For nothing but hard blows. If the Orleanese\r\nCreoles would but contemplate these truths, they would cling to the\r\nAmerican Union, soul and body, as their first affection, and we should\r\nbe as safe there as we are everywhere else. I have no doubt of their\r\nattachment to us in preference of the English.\r\n\r\nI salute you with sincere affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 28, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I thank you for the copy of General Kosciusko's treatise on\r\nthe flying artillery. It is a branch of the military art which I wish\r\nextremely to see understood here, to the height of the European level.\r\nYour letter of September 20th was received in due time. I never received\r\nthe letter said to have been written to me by Mr. Malesherbe, in favor\r\nof Mr. Masson. The fact of such a letter having been written by Mr.\r\nMalesherbe, is sufficient ground for my desiring to be useful to Mr.\r\nMasson on any occasion which may arise. No man's recommendation merits\r\nmore reliance than that of M. de Malesherbe. The state and interest of\r\nthe military academy shall not be forgotten. I salute you with esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 29, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I send the enclosed letter under the benefit of your cover, and\r\nopen, because I wish you to know its contents. I thought the person to\r\nwhom it is addressed a very good man when here,--he is certainly a very\r\nlearned and able one. I thought him peculiarly qualified to be useful\r\nwith you. But in the present state of my information, I can say no more\r\nthan I have to him. When you shall have read the letter, be so good as\r\nto stick a wafer in it, and not let it be delivered till it is dry, that\r\nhe may not know that any one but himself sees it. The Spanish paper you\r\nenclosed me is an atrocious one. I see it has been republished in the\r\nHavanna. The truth is that the patriots of Spain have no warmer friends\r\nthan the administration of the United States, but it is our duty to say\r\nnothing and to do nothing for or against either. If they succeed, we\r\nshall be well satisfied to see Cuba and Mexico remain in their present\r\ndependence; but very unwilling to see them in that of either France or\r\nEngland, politically or commercially. We consider their interests and ours\r\nas the same, and that the object of both must be to exclude all European\r\ninfluence from this hemisphere. We wish to avoid the necessity of going to\r\nwar, till our revenue shall be entirely liberated from debt. Then it will\r\nsuffice for war, without creating new debt or taxes. These are sentiments\r\nwhich I would wish you to express to any proper characters of either of\r\nthese two countries, and particularly that we have nothing more at heart\r\nthan their friendship. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          November 3, 1808.\r\n\r\nA press of business here prevented my sooner taking up the three bundles\r\nof papers now returned; and even now I judge of them from the brief you\r\nhave been so good as to make so fully. This is an immense relief to me.\r\n\r\n_The Warbash Saline._\r\n\r\nI think the applications from Nashville, &c., for a share of the salt\r\nhad better not be complied with. I suspect we did wrong in yielding a\r\nsimilar privilege to Kentucky. There would be no end to the details of\r\nthe partitionary plan, and it will only shift the gains into other hands,\r\nadding the unavoidable inequalities of distribution. Better leave the\r\ndistribution to its former and ordinary course, and the benefits will\r\ntaper off from the centre till lost by distance.\r\n\r\n_Indiana Lead Mines._\r\n\r\nI think it would be well to authorize Governor Harrison to lease them to\r\nthe present applicants,--the former ones declining.\r\n\r\n_Intrusions on Public Lands._\r\n\r\nI suspect you have partly forgotten what was agreed on the other day.\r\n1. Notice was agreed to be given by a register to be appointed to all\r\nintruders on the Tennessee purchase, to disclaim or remove; and _in the\r\nspring_ troops are to be sent to remove all non-compliers. Those on the\r\nIndian lands (except Double-heads) to be absolutely removed without the\r\nprivilege of disclaimer. 2. As to the intruders on Red River, we agreed to\r\nleave them and get Congress to extend the land law to them.\r\n\r\nI think it will be better you should write to Governor Williams about the\r\nappointment of officers. Things casually incidental to a main business\r\nbelonging to another department, had better be made the subject of a\r\nsingle instruction. I am sure the Secretary of State will thank you to\r\ntake the trouble. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                          November 5, 1808.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a charge by Mr. Hanson against Captain Smith and Lieutenants\r\nDavis and Dobbins of the militia, as having become members of an organized\r\ncompany, calling themselves the Tar Company, avowing their object to\r\nbe the tarring and feathering citizens of some description. Although\r\nin some cases the animadversions of the law may be properly relied on\r\nto prevent what is unlawful, yet with those clothed with authority from\r\nthe executive, and being a part of the executive, other preventives are\r\nexpedient. These officers should be warned that the executive cannot\r\ntamely look on and see its officers threaten to become the violators\r\ninstead of the protectors of the rights of our citizens. I presume,\r\nhowever, that all that is necessary will be that their commanding\r\nofficer, (General Mason,) finding the fact true, should give them a\r\n_private_ admonition, either written or verbal, as he pleases, to withdraw\r\nthemselves from the illegal association; at the same time I would rather\r\nit should be stated to General Mason only \"that information has been\r\nreceived,\" &c., without naming Mr. Hanson as the informer. My reason is\r\nthat some disagreeable feuds have arisen at the Navy Yard which I would\r\nrather allay than foment. No proof will be necessary to be called for;\r\nbecause if the officers disavow the fact, it will be a proof they have\r\nthat sense of propriety to which only an admonition would be intended to\r\nbring them. I salute you with constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, November 8, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters September\r\n10th and of blank date, probably about the middle of October, and to\r\nthank you for the communications therein made. They were handed to the\r\ntwo persons therein named. I seize the first moment it is in my power to\r\nanswer your question as to our foreign relations, which I do by enclosing\r\nyou a copy of my message this moment delivered to the two houses of\r\nCongress, in which they are fully stated. It is evident we have before us\r\nthree only alternatives; 1, embargo; 2, war; 3, submission and tribute.\r\nThis last will at once be put out of question by every American, and the\r\ntwo first only considered. By the little conversation I have had with\r\nthe members, I perceive there will be some division on this among the\r\nrepublicans; but what will be its extent cannot be known till they shall\r\nhave heard the message and documents, and had some days to confer and make\r\nup their opinions. Being now all in the hurry and bustle of visits and\r\nbusiness, incident to the first days of the meeting, I must here close\r\nwith my salutations of friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LETUE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, November 8, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of October 14th,\r\nand to thank you for the information it contained. While the opposition to\r\nthe late laws of embargo has in one quarter amounted almost to rebellion\r\nand treason, it is pleasing to know that all the rest of the nation has\r\napproved of the proceedings of the constituted authorities. The steady\r\nunion which you mention of our fellow citizens of South Carolina, is\r\nentirely in their character. They have never failed in fidelity to their\r\ncountry and the republican spirit of its constitution. Never before was\r\nthat union more needed or more salutary than under our present crisis. I\r\nenclose you my message to both houses of Congress, this moment delivered.\r\nYou will see that we have to choose between the alternatives of embargo\r\nand war; there is indeed one and only one other, that is submission\r\nand tribute. For all the federal propositions for trading to the places\r\npermitted by the edicts of the belligerents, result in fact in submission,\r\nalthough they do not choose to pronounce the naked word. I do not believe,\r\nhowever, that our fellow citizens of that sect with you will concur\r\nwith those to the east in this paricide purpose, any more than in the\r\ndisorganizing conduct which has disgraced the latter. I conclude this from\r\ntheir conduct in your legislature in its vote on that question. Accept my\r\nsalutations and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Between three and four years ago, I received the enclosed\r\npetitions praying for the pardon or the enlargement of Thomas\r\nLogwood, then and still confined in the penitentiary of Richmond, for\r\ncounterfeiting the bank notes of the United States. I consulted Governor\r\nPage on the subject, who, after conferring with his council, informed me\r\nthat though he was for a pardon himself, he found a division of opinion\r\non the question, and therefore could not advise it. Between three and four\r\nyears have since been added to his confinement, and if his conduct during\r\nthat time has been such as to lessen his claims to a mitigation of his\r\nsentence, they must certainly stand now on higher ground, and the more\r\nso as two of his accomplices confined here, have by a very general wish\r\nbeen pardoned more than a year ago. Will you be so good as to give me your\r\nopinion on the subject, as you are in a situation to know what his conduct\r\nhas been? His wife is represented as a very meritorious character, and her\r\nconnections respectable; probably they may be known to you. His neighbors,\r\nyou will observe, ask his restoration to them. Whether would it be best\r\nto pardon him absolutely, or on condition of giving security for his good\r\nbehavior? or shall we open the prison door and let him go out, notifying\r\nhim that if he will continue on his own farm or those next adjoining,\r\nand keep himself from all suspicious intercourse and correspondence, he\r\nwill not be molested; otherwise, that he will be retaken and replaced in\r\nhis present situation? Your advice on this subject will much oblige me. I\r\nsalute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         November 13, 1808.\r\n\r\n1st. The ship Aurora, Captain Rand. Provisions, lumber and naval stores\r\nbeing the articles on which we rely most for effect during our embargo.\r\nRand's landing, as to the great mass of its articles, seems not to render\r\nhis case suspicious. Keeping therefore the articles of provisions, lumber\r\nand naval stores, within their regular limits, I see no objection to a\r\npermit in the character of his cargo; and the objection drawn from his\r\ndislike and disapprobation of the embargo, has never been considered as an\r\nobstacle where the person has not actually been guilty of its infraction.\r\nI think a permit should be granted under the regular limitations as to the\r\nproportion of provisions, &c.\r\n\r\n2d. The schooner Concord, property of John Bell of Petersburg. Wherever a\r\nperson has once been guilty of breaking the embargo laws, we can no longer\r\nhave confidence in him, and every shipment made by him becomes suspicious.\r\nNo permit should be granted him; the fact of a prior breach being\r\nsufficient without the formality of its being found by jury.\r\n\r\n3d. The schooner Caroline, belonging to Brown and Pilsbury of Buckstown.\r\nWhere every attempt, the Collector says, has been made and still\r\ncontinues to be made to evade the embargo laws, the nature of the cargo is\r\nsufficient to refuse the permit, being wholly of provisions and lumber.\r\nThis is the first time the character of the place has been brought under\r\nconsideration as an objection. Yet a general disobedience to the laws in\r\nany place must have weight towards refusing to give them any facilities\r\nto evade. In such a case we may fairly require positive proof that the\r\nindividual of a town tainted with a general spirit of disobedience, has\r\nnever said or done anything himself to countenance that spirit. But the\r\nfirst cause of refusal being sufficient, an inquiry into character and\r\nconduct is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a petition from Nantucket, and refer it for\r\nyour decision. Our opinion here is, that that place has been so deeply\r\nconcerned in smuggling, that if it wants, it is because it has illegally\r\nsent away what it ought to have retained for its own consumption. Be\r\nso good as to bear in mind that I have asked the favor of you to see\r\nthat your State encounters no real want, while, at the same time, where\r\napplications are made merely to cover fraud, no facilities towards that be\r\nfurnished. I presume there can be no want in Massachusetts as yet, as I am\r\ninformed that Governor Sullivan's permits are openly bought and sold here\r\nand in Alexandria, and at other markets. The congressional campaign is\r\njust opening: three alternatives alone are to be chosen from. 1. Embargo.\r\n2. War. 3. Submission and tribute. And, wonderful to tell, the last will\r\nnot want advocates. The real question, however, will lie between the two\r\nfirst, on which there is considerable division. As yet the first seems\r\nmost to prevail; but opinions are by no means yet settled down. Perhaps\r\nthe advocates of the second may, to a formal declaration of war, prefer\r\n_general_ letters of mark and reprisal, because, on a repeal of their\r\nedicts by the belligerent, a revocation of the letters of mark restores\r\npeace without the delay, difficulties, and ceremonies of a treaty. On this\r\noccasion, I think it is fair to leave to those who are to act on them,\r\nthe decisions they prefer, being to be myself but a spectator. I should\r\nnot feel justified in directing measures which those who are to execute\r\nthem would disapprove. Our situation is truly difficult. We have been\r\npressed by the belligerents to the very wall, and all further retreat is\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nI salute you with sincere friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. JOSEPH VARNUM.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--You will perceive in the enclosed petitions, a request that I\r\nwill lay them before Congress. This I cannot do consistently with my\r\nown opinion of propriety, because where the petitioners have a right\r\nto petition their immediate representatives in Congress directly, I\r\nhave deemed it neither necessary nor proper for them to pass their\r\npetition through the intermediate channel of the Executive. But as the\r\npetitioners may be ignorant of this, and, confiding in it, may omit the\r\nproper measure, I have usually put such petitions into the hands of the\r\nRepresentatives of the State, informally to be used or not as they see\r\nbest, and considering me as entirely disclaiming any agency in the case.\r\nWith this view, I take the liberty of placing these papers in your hands,\r\nnot as Speaker of the House, but as one of the Representatives from\r\nthe State from which they came. Whether they should be handed on to the\r\nRepresentatives of the particular districts, (which are unknown to me,)\r\nyourself will be the best judge. I salute you with affection, esteem, and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS JEFFERSON RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 24, 1808.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JEFFERSON, * * * * *\r\n\r\nYour situation, thrown at such a distance from us, and alone, cannot but\r\ngive us all great anxieties for you. As much has been secured for you,\r\nby your particular position and the acquaintance to which you have been\r\nrecommended, as could be done towards shielding you from the dangers\r\nwhich surround you. But thrown on a wide world, among entire strangers,\r\nwithout a friend or guardian to advise, so young too, and with so little\r\nexperience of mankind, your dangers are great, and still your safety must\r\nrest on yourself. A determination never to do what is wrong, prudence\r\nand good humor, will go far towards securing to you the estimation of the\r\nworld. When I recollect that at fourteen years of age, the whole care and\r\ndirection of myself was thrown on myself entirely, without a relation or\r\nfriend qualified to advise or guide me, and recollect the various sorts\r\nof bad company with which I associated from time to time, I am astonished\r\nI did not turn off with some of them, and become as worthless to society\r\nas they were. I had the good fortune to become acquainted very early with\r\nsome characters of very high standing, and to feel the incessant wish that\r\nI could ever become what they were. Under temptations and difficulties,\r\nI would ask myself what would Dr. Small, Mr. Wythe, Peyton Randolph do\r\nin this situation? What course in it will insure me their approbation?\r\nI am certain that this mode of deciding on my conduct, tended more to\r\ncorrectness than any reasoning powers I possessed. Knowing the even and\r\ndignified line they pursued, I could never doubt for a moment which of two\r\ncourses would be in character for them. Whereas, seeking the same object\r\nthrough a process of moral reasoning, and with the jaundiced eye of youth,\r\nI should often have erred. From the circumstances of my position, I was\r\noften thrown into the society of horse racers, card players, fox hunters,\r\nscientific and professional men, and of dignified men; and many a time\r\nhave I asked myself, in the enthusiastic moment of the death of a fox, the\r\nvictory of a favorite horse, the issue of a question eloquently argued at\r\nthe bar, or in the great council of the nation, well, which of these kinds\r\nof reputation should I prefer? That of a horse jockey? a fox hunter? an\r\norator? or the honest advocate of my country's rights? Be assured, my dear\r\nJefferson, that these little returns into ourselves, this self-catechising\r\nhabit, is not trifling nor useless, but leads to the prudent selection and\r\nsteady pursuit of what is right.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned good humor as one of the preservatives of our peace and\r\ntranquillity. It is among the most effectual, and its effect is so well\r\nimitated and aided, artificially, by politeness, that this also becomes\r\nan acquisition of first rate value. In truth, politeness is artificial\r\ngood humor, it covers the natural want of it, and ends by rendering\r\nhabitual a substitute nearly equivalent to the real virtue. It is the\r\npractice of sacrificing to those whom we meet in society, all the little\r\nconveniences and preferences which will gratify them, and deprive us of\r\nnothing worth a moment's consideration; it is the giving a pleasing and\r\nflattering turn to our expressions, which will conciliate others, and\r\nmake them pleased with us as well as themselves. How cheap a price for\r\nthe good will of another! When this is in return for a rude thing said by\r\nanother, it brings him to his senses, it mortifies and corrects him in the\r\nmost salutary way, and places him at the feet of your good nature, in the\r\neyes of the company. But in stating prudential rules for our government\r\nin society, I must not omit the important one of never entering into\r\ndispute or argument with another. I never saw an instance of one of two\r\ndisputants convincing the other by argument. I have seen many, on their\r\ngetting warm, becoming rude, and shooting one another. Conviction is the\r\neffect of our own dispassionate reasoning, either in solitude, or weighing\r\nwithin ourselves, dispassionately, what we hear from others, standing\r\nuncommitted in argument ourselves. It was one of the rules which, above\r\nall others, made Doctor Franklin the most amiable of men in society,\r\n\"never to contradict anybody.\" If he was urged to announce an opinion, he\r\ndid it rather by asking questions, as if for information, or by suggesting\r\ndoubts. When I hear another express an opinion which is not mine, I say to\r\nmyself, he has a right to his opinion, as I to mine; why should I question\r\nit? His error does me no injury, and shall I become a Don Quixotte, to\r\nbring all men by force of argument to one opinion? If a fact be misstated,\r\nit is probable he is gratified by a belief of it, and I have no right to\r\ndeprive him of the gratification. If he wants information, he will ask\r\nit, and then I will give it in measured terms; but if he still believes\r\nhis own story, and shows a desire to dispute the fact with me, I hear him\r\nand say nothing. It is his affair, not mine, if he prefers error. There\r\nare two classes of disputants most frequently to be met with among us.\r\nThe first is of young students, just entered the threshold of science,\r\nwith a first view of its outlines, not yet filled up with the details and\r\nmodifications which a further progress would bring to their knowledge. The\r\nother consists of the ill-tempered and rude men in society, who have taken\r\nup a passion for politics. (Good humor and politeness never introduce into\r\nmixed society, a question on which they foresee there will be a difference\r\nof opinion.) From both of those classes of disputants, my dear Jefferson,\r\nkeep aloof, as you would from the infected subjects of yellow fever or\r\npestilence. Consider yourself, when with them, as among the patients of\r\nBedlam, needing medical more than moral counsel. Be a listener only, keep\r\nwithin yourself, and endeavor to establish with yourself the habit of\r\nsilence, especially on politics. In the fevered state of our country, no\r\ngood can ever result from any attempt to set one of these fiery zealots to\r\nrights, either in fact or principle. They are determined as to the facts\r\nthey will believe, and the opinions on which they will act. Get by them,\r\ntherefore, as you would by an angry bull; it is not for a man of sense\r\nto dispute the road with such an animal. You will be more exposed than\r\nothers to have these animals shaking their horns at you, because of the\r\nrelation in which you stand with me. Full of political venom, and willing\r\nto see me and to hate me as a chief in the antagonist party, your presence\r\nwill be to them what the vomit grass is to the sick dog, a nostrum for\r\nproducing ejaculation. Look upon them exactly with that eye, and pity them\r\nas objects to whom you can administer only occasional ease. My character\r\nis not within their power. It is in the hands of my fellow citizens at\r\nlarge, and will be consigned to honor or infamy by the verdict of the\r\nrepublican mass of our country, according to what themselves will have\r\nseen, not what their enemies and mine shall have said. Never, therefore,\r\nconsider these puppies in politics as requiring any notice from you, and\r\nalways show that you are not afraid to leave my character to the umpirage\r\nof public opinion. Look steadily to the pursuits which have carried you to\r\nPhiladelphia, be very select in the society you attach yourself to, avoid\r\ntaverns, drinkers, smokers, idlers, and dissipated persons generally; for\r\nit is with such that broils and contentions arise; and you will find your\r\npath more easy and tranquil. The limits of my paper warn me that it is\r\ntime for me to close with my affectionate adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. Present me affectionately to Mr. Ogilvie, and, in doing the same to\r\nMr. Peale, tell him I am writing with his polygraph, and shall send him\r\nmine the first moment I have leisure enough to pack it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE VICE-PRESIDENTS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Being to remove within a few months from my present residence\r\nto one still more distant from the seat of the meetings of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, I feel it a duty no longer to obstruct its\r\nservice by keeping from the chair members whose position as well as\r\nqualifications, may enable them to discharge its duties with so much more\r\neffect. Begging leave, therefore, to withdraw from the Presidency of the\r\nSociety at the close of the present term, I avail myself of the occasion\r\ngratefully to return my thanks to the Society for the repeated proofs\r\nthey have been pleased to give of their favor and confidence in me, and\r\nto assure them, in retiring from the honorable station in which they\r\nhave been pleased so long to continue me, that I carry with me all the\r\nsentiments of an affectionate member and faithful servant of the Society.\r\n\r\nAsking the favor of you to make this communication to the Society, I\r\nbeg leave to tender to each of you personally the assurances of my great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SAMUEL HAWKINS, KINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 30, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Business and indisposition have prevented my sooner acknowledging\r\nthe receipt of your letter of the 3d instant, which came to hand on the\r\n10th. Mr. Granger, before that, had sent here the very elegant ivory staff\r\nof which you wished my acceptance. The motives of your wish are honorable\r\nto me, and gratifying, as they evidence the approbation of my public\r\nconduct by a stranger who has not viewed it through the partialities of\r\npersonal acquaintance. Be assured, Sir, that I am as grateful for the\r\ntestimony, as if I could have accepted the token of it which you have\r\nso kindly offered. On coming into public office, I laid it down as a\r\nlaw of my conduct, while I should continue in it, to accept no present\r\nof any sensible pecuniary value. A pamphlet, a new book, or an article\r\nof new curiosity, have produced no hesitation, because below suspicion.\r\nBut things of sensible value, however innocently offered in the first\r\nexamples, may grow at length into abuse, for which I wish not to furnish\r\na precedent. The kindness of the motives which led to this manifestation\r\nof your esteem, sufficiently assures me that you will approve of my\r\ndesire, by a perseverance in the rule, to retain that consciousness of a\r\ndisinterested administration of the public trusts, which is essential to\r\nperfect tranquillity of mind. Replacing, therefore, the subject of this\r\nletter in the hands of Mr. Granger, under your orders, and repeating that\r\nthe offer meets the same thankfulness as if accepted, I tender you my\r\nsalutations and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WATERHOUSE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, December 1, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,---In answer to the inquiries of the benevolent Dr. De Carro on the\r\nsubject of the upland or mountain rice, Oryza Mutica, I will state to\r\nyou what I know of it. I first became informed of the existence of a rice\r\nwhich would grow in uplands without any more water than the common rains,\r\nby reading a book of Mr. De Porpre, who had been Governor of the Isle of\r\nFrance, who mentions it as growing there and all along the coast of Africa\r\nsuccessfully, and as having been introduced from Cochin-China. I was at\r\nthat time (1784-89) in France, and there happening to be there a Prince\r\nof Cochin-China, on his travels, and then returning home, I obtained his\r\npromise to send me some. I never received it however, and mention it only\r\nas it may have been sent, and furnished the ground for the inquiries of\r\nDr. De Carro, respecting my receiving it from China. When at Havre on my\r\nreturn from France, I found there Captain Nathaniel Cutting, who was the\r\nensuing spring to go on a voyage along the coast of Africa. I engaged him\r\nto inquire for this; he was there just after the harvest, procured and\r\nsent me a thirty-gallon cask of it. It arrived in time the ensuing spring\r\nto be sown. I divided it between the Agricultural Society of Charleston\r\nand some private gentlemen of Georgia, recommending it to their care,\r\nin the hope which had induced me to endeavor to obtain it, that if it\r\nanswered as well as the swamp rice, it might rid them of that source of\r\ntheir summer diseases. Nothing came of the trials in South Carolina, but\r\nbeing carried into the upper hilly parts of Georgia, it succeeded there\r\nperfectly, has spread over the country, and is now commonly cultivated;\r\nstill, however, for family use chiefly, as they cannot make it for sale in\r\ncompetition with the rice of the swamps. The former part of these details\r\nis written from memory, the papers being at Monticello which would enable\r\nme to particularize exactly the dates of times and places. The latter\r\npart is from the late Mr. Baldwin, one of those whom I engaged in the\r\ndistribution of the seed in Georgia, and who in his annual attendance on\r\nCongress, gave me from time to time the history of its progress. It has\r\ngot from Georgia into Kentucky, where it is cultivated by many individuals\r\nfor family use. I cultivated it two or three years at Monticello, and\r\nhad good crops, as did my neighbors, but not having conveniences for\r\nhusking it, we declined it. I tried some of it in a pot, while I lived in\r\nPhiladelphia, and gave seed to Mr. Bartram. It produced luxuriant plants\r\nwith us both, but no seed; nor do I believe it will ripen in the United\r\nStates as far north as Philadelphia. Business and an indisposition of some\r\ndays must apologize for this delay in answering your letter of October\r\n24th, which I did not receive till the 6th of November. And permit me here\r\nto add my salutations and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                          December 4, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe case of the sale of city lots under a decree of the Chancellor of\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nThe deed of the original owners of the site of the city of Washington to\r\ncertain trustees, after making provisions for streets, public squares,\r\n&c., declares that the residue of the ground, laid off in building lots,\r\nshall one moiety belong to the original proprietors, and the other moiety\r\nshall be sold on such terms and conditions as the President of the United\r\nStates shall direct, the proceeds, after certain specified payments, to\r\nbe paid to the President as a grant of money, and to be applied for the\r\npurposes, and according to the Act of Congress; which Act of Congress\r\n(1790, c. 28) had authorized the President to accept grants of money,\r\nto purchase or to accept land for the use of the United States, to\r\nprovide suitable buildings, &c. Of these residuary building lots, one\r\nthousand were sold by the Commissioner to Greenleaf for $80,000, who\r\ntransferred them to Morris and Nicholson, with an express lien on them\r\nfor the purchase money due to the city. Under this lien the Chancellor\r\nof Maryland has decreed that they shall be sold immediately for whatever\r\nthey will bring; that the proceeds shall be applied first to the costs\r\nof suit and sale, and the balance towards paying the original purchase\r\nmoney. The sale has now proceeded, for some days, at very low prices,\r\nand must proceed till the costs of suit and sale are raised. It is well\r\nunderstood that under no circumstances of sale, however favorable, can\r\nthey pay five in the pound of the original debt; and that if the whole\r\nare now forced into sale, at what they will bring, they will not pay\r\none in the pound; and being the only fund from which a single dollar of\r\nthe debt can ever be recovered, (on account of the bankruptcy of all the\r\npurchasers,) of $25,000 which the lots may bring if offered for sale from\r\ntime to time _pari passu_ with the growing demand, $20,000 will be lost\r\nby a forced sale. To save this sum is desirable. And the interest in it\r\nbeing ultimately that of the United States, I have consulted with the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and Comptroller, and after due consideration,\r\nI am of opinion it is for the public interest, and within the powers of\r\nthe President, under the deed of trust and laws, to repurchase under the\r\ndecree, at the lowest prices obtainable, such of these lots as no other\r\npurchaser shall offer to take at what the Superintendent shall deem\r\ntheir real value, that is to say, what they will in his judgment sell\r\nfor hereafter, if only offered from time to time as purchasers shall\r\nwant them. The sums so to be allowed for them by the Superintendent\r\nto be passed to the credit of Greenleaf, and retaining a right to the\r\nunsatisfied balance as damages due for non-compliance with his contract;\r\na matter of form only, as not a cent of it is expected ever to be\r\nobtained. I consider the reconveyance of these lots at the price which\r\nthe Superintendent shall nominally allow for them, as replacing them in\r\nour hands, in _statu quo_ prices, as if the title had never been passed\r\nout of us; and that thereafter they will be in the condition of all other\r\nlots, sold, but neither conveyed nor paid for; that is to say, liable to\r\nbe resold for the benefit of the city; as has been invariably practised in\r\nall other cases. The Superintendent is instructed to proceed accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          December 7, 1808.\r\n\r\n1. D. W. Coxe and the ship Comet. The application to send another vessel\r\nto the Havanna, to bring home the proceeds of the cargo of the Comet,\r\ncharged with a breach of embargo, must be rejected for three reasons,\r\neach insuperable. 1st. The property was not shipped from the United States\r\nprior to December 22d, 1807, and therefore is not within the description\r\nof cases in which a permission by the executive is authorized by law.\r\n2d. The limitation of time for permissions has been long expired. 3d.\r\nAlthough in an action on the bond of the Comet, the fabricated testimony\r\nof distress may embarrass judges and juries, tramelled by legal rules\r\nof evidence, yet it ought to have no weight with us to whom the law\r\nhas referred to decide according to our discretion, well knowing that\r\nit was impossible to build up fraud by general rules. We know that the\r\nfabrication of proofs of leaky ships, stress of weather, cargoes sold\r\nunder duress, are a regular part of the system of infractions of the\r\nembargo, with the manufacture of which every foreign port is provided, and\r\nthat their oaths and forgeries are a regular merchandise in every port.\r\nWe must therefore consider them as nothing, and that the act of entering a\r\nforeign port and selling the cargo is decisive evidence of an intentional\r\nbreach of embargo, not to be countervailed by the letters of all the\r\nCharles Dixeys in the world; for every vessel is provided with a Charles\r\nDixey.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is therefore that no permission ought ever to be granted for\r\nany vessel to leave our ports (while the embargo continues) in which any\r\nperson is concerned either in interest or in navigating her, who has ever\r\nbeen concerned in interest, or in the navigation of a vessel which has\r\nat any time before entered a foreign port contrary to the views of the\r\nembargo laws, and under any pretended distress or duress whatever. This\r\nrule will not lead us wrong once in a hundred times.\r\n\r\n2. I send you the case of Mr. Mitchell and the ship Neutrality, merely\r\nas a matter of form; for I presume it must be rejected on the ground of\r\nlimitation. These petitioners are getting into the habit of calling on me\r\npersonally in the first instance. These personal solicitations being very\r\nembarrassing, I am obliged to tell them I will refer the case to you, and\r\nthey will receive a written answer. But I hope, in your amendments to the\r\nlaw, you will propose a repeal of the power to give permissions to go for\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          December 8, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe idea of regulating the coasting trade (to New Orleans for instance)\r\nby the quantity of tonnage sufficient for each port, is new to me, and\r\npresents difficulties through which I cannot see my way. To determine how\r\nmuch tonnage will suffice for the coasting trade of Boston, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and the other ports great and small, and to divide this\r\ntonnage impartially among the competitors of each place, would embarrass\r\nus infinitely, and lead to unavoidable errors and irregularities. Is it\r\nnot better to let it regulate itself as to all innocent articles, and to\r\ncontinue our attentions and regulations to the articles of provisions and\r\nlumber? If the rule of the _one-eighth_ carries too much to New Orleans,\r\nand I am sure it does, why not confine it to the ports between St. Mary's\r\nand Passamaquoddy, (excluding these two,) and trust for New Orleans to\r\nthe western supplies and Governor Claiborne's permits? I suppose them\r\nsufficient, because Governor Claiborne has assured us that the Western\r\nsupplies are sufficient for the consumption of New Orleans, and we see\r\nthat New Orleans has exported flour the last six months, and that too\r\nto the West Indies, whither will go also whatever flour the rule of the\r\n_one-eighth_ carries there, or its equivalent in Western flour. These\r\nideas on the subject are of the first impression; and I keep the decision\r\nopen for any further light which can be thrown on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          December 8, 1808.\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison will continue in office till the 3d of March. I send you tit\r\nfor tat, one lady application for another. However our feelings are to\r\nbe perpetually harrowed by these solicitations, our course is plain, and\r\ninflexible to right or left. But for God's sake get us relieved from this\r\ndreadful drudgery of refusal. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 20, 1808.\r\n\r\n_The case of the schooner Concord, sold by J. Bell of Petersburg, to M. W.\r\nHancock of Richmond._\r\n\r\nI think it may be concluded from the letters of Hancock and the collector,\r\nthat the purchase of the schooner has been a _bonâ fide_ one; but it is\r\nnot even alleged that he has purchased the cargo, but it appears on the\r\ncontrary that Bell has the same concern in that as before. As, where\r\na person has once evaded the embargo laws, we consider all subsequent\r\nshipments and proposed voyages by him to be with the fraudulent intention;\r\nthe present shipment of the cargo of tobacco, before refused, being still\r\nthe concern of Bell, must of course be still suspicious, and refused a\r\npermit. But the request of the purchaser of the schooner, that, after\r\ntaking out the cargo, he may have a clearance for her to go in ballast to\r\nthe district of Richmond, may be granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 22, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the petition of Percival and others, praying that they may\r\nbe permitted to send a vessel or vessels to take up their men from the\r\ndesolate islands of the Indian Ocean, and thence to proceed on a trading\r\nvoyage to Canton, &c., cannot but be a thing of course, that days having\r\nbeen publicly announced after which no permissions to send vessels to\r\nbring home property would be granted, which days are past long since,\r\nand the rule rigorously adhered to, it cannot now be broken through.\r\nIf Congress continue the power, it will show that they mean it shall be\r\nexercised, and we may then consider on what new grounds permissions may be\r\ngranted. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 22, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I always consider it as the most friendly office which can be\r\nrendered me, to be informed of anything which is going amiss, and which I\r\ncan remedy. I had known that there had been a very blamable failure in the\r\nclothing department, which had not become known so as to be remedied till\r\nthe beginning of October; but I had believed that the remedy had then been\r\napplied with as much diligence as the case admitted. After the suggestions\r\nfrom General Smith and Mr. Giles the other day, I made inquiry into the\r\nfact, and have received the enclosed return, which will show exactly what\r\nhas been done. Can I get the favor of you to show it to General Smith\r\nand Mr. Giles, to whom I am sure it will give as much satisfaction as to\r\nmyself, and to re-enclose it to me? I salute you and them with sincere\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HARRISON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 22, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--By the treaty of 1803, we obtained from the Kaskaskias the country\r\nas far as the ridge dividing the waters of the Kaskaskias from those\r\nof the Illinois River; by the treaty of 1804, with the Sacs and Foxes,\r\nthey ceded to us from the Illinois to the Ouisconsin. Between these two\r\ncessions is a gore of country, to wit, between the Illinois River and\r\nKaskaskias line, which I understand to have belonged to the Piorias, and\r\nthat that tribe is now extinct; if both these facts be true, we succeed\r\nto their title by our being proprietors paramount of the whole country.\r\nIn this case it is interesting to settle our boundary with our next\r\nneighbors the Kickapoos. Where their western boundary is, I know not;\r\nbut they cannot come lower down the Illinois River than the Illinois\r\nLake, on which stood the old Pioria fort, and perhaps not so low. The\r\nKickapoos are bounded to the south-east, I presume, by the ridge between\r\nthe waters of the Illinois and Wabash, to which the Miamis claim, and\r\nnorth-east by the Pottewatamies. Of course it is with the Kickapoos\r\nalone we have to settle a boundary. I would therefore recommend to you to\r\ntake measures for doing this. You will of course first endeavor with all\r\npossible caution to furnish yourself with the best evidence to be had, of\r\nthe real location of the south-west boundary of the Kickapoos, and then\r\nendeavor to bring them to an acknowledgment of it formally, by a treaty\r\nof limits. If it be nothing more, the ordinary presents are all that will\r\nbe necessary, but if they cede a part of their own country, then a price\r\nproportioned will be proper. In a letter to you of February 27th, 1803,\r\nI mentioned that I had heard there was still one Pioria man living, and\r\nthat a compensation making him easy for life should be given him, and his\r\nconveyance of the country by a regular deed be obtained. If there be such\r\na man living, I think this should still be done. The ascertaining the\r\nline between the Kickapoos and us is now of importance, because it will\r\nclose our possessions on the hither bank of the Mississippi from the Ohio\r\nto the Ouisconsin, and give us a broad margin to prevent the British from\r\napproaching that river, on which, under color of their treaty, they would\r\nbe glad to hover, that they might smuggle themselves and their merchandise\r\ninto Louisiana. Their treaty can only operate on the country so long as\r\nit is Indian; and in proportion as it becomes ours exclusively, their\r\nground is narrowed. It makes it easier too for us to adopt on this side\r\nof the Mississippi a policy we are beginning on the other side, that of\r\npermitting no traders, either ours or theirs, to go to the Indian towns,\r\nbut oblige them all to settle and be stationary at our factories, where\r\nwe can have their conduct under our observation and control. However, our\r\nfirst object must be to blockade them from the Mississippi, and to this I\r\nask the favor of your attention; and salute you with great friendship and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 25, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you Doctor Maese's letter, which a pressure of\r\nbusiness has occasioned me to keep too long. I think an account of\r\nthe manufactures of Philadelphia would be really useful, and that the\r\nmanufactures of other places should be added from time to time, as\r\ninformation of them should be received. To give a perfect view of the\r\nwhole, would require a report from every county or township of the\r\nUnited States. Perhaps the present moment would be premature, as they\r\nare, in truth, but just now in preparation. The government could not\r\naid the publication by the subscription suggested by Doctor Maese,\r\nwithout a special law for it. All the purposes for which they can pay\r\na single dollar, are specified by law. The advantage of the veterinary\r\ninstitution proposed, may perhaps be doubted. If it be problematical\r\nwhether physicians prevent death where the disease, unaided, would have\r\nterminated fatally,--oftener than they produce it, where order would have\r\nbeen restored to the system by the process, if uninterrupted, provided\r\nby nature, and in the case of a man who can describe the seat of his\r\ndisease, its character, progress, and often its cause, what might we\r\nexpect in the case of the horse,--mute, &c., yielding no sensible and\r\ncertain indications of his disease? They have long had these institutions\r\nin Europe; has the world received as yet one iota of valuable information\r\nfrom them? If it has, it is unknown to me. At any rate, it may be doubted\r\nwhether, where so many institutions of obvious utility are yet wanting, we\r\nshould select this one to take the lead. I return you Gibbon, with thanks.\r\nI send you, also, for your shelf of pamphlets, one which gives really a\r\ngood historical view of our funding system, and of federal transactions\r\ngenerally, from an early day to the present time. I salute you with\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMSON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 25, 1808.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my dear and ancient friend, for the two volumes of your\r\ntranslation, which you have been so kind as to send me. I have dipped into\r\nit at the few moments of leisure which my vocations permit, and I perceive\r\nthat I shall use it with great satisfaction on my return home. I propose\r\nthere, among my first employments, to give to the Septuagint an attentive\r\nperusal, and shall feel the aid you have now given me. I am full of plans\r\nof employment when I get there,--they chiefly respect the active functions\r\nof the body. To the mind I shall administer amusement chiefly. An only\r\ndaughter and numerous family of grandchildren, will furnish me great\r\nresources of happiness. I learn with sincere pleasure that you have health\r\nand activity enough to have performed the journey to and from Lancaster\r\nwithout inconvenience. It has added another proof that you are not wearied\r\nwith well-doing. Although I have enjoyed as uniform health through life\r\nas reason could desire, I have no expectation that, even if spared to\r\nyour age, I shall at that period be able to take such a journey. I am\r\nalready sensible of decay in the power of walking, and find my memory not\r\nso faithful as it used to be. This may be partly owing to the incessant\r\ncurrent of new matter flowing constantly through it; but I ascribe to\r\nyears their share in it also. That you may be continued among us to the\r\nperiod of your own wishes, and that it may be filled with continued health\r\nand happiness, is the sincere prayer of your affectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed petition, from Deville, was handed me by Gen. Turreau. I told\r\nhim at once it was inadmissible; that days had been long ago announced,\r\nafter which no vessel would be permitted to depart; that in favor of\r\nemigrants we had continued indulgences till very lately; but as there\r\nmust be an end to it, that time had come, and we had determined to give\r\nno more permissions. They had had a complete year to depart, and had not\r\navailed themselves of it. He appeared satisfied, and perhaps will himself\r\ngive the answer. However, an answer of the above purport may be given from\r\nyour office. I have referred the case of the British boats to the Attorney\r\nGeneral for his opinion. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR LOGAN.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 27, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 8th, by Mr. Cunow, was duly received, and I\r\nnow return you the letter it covered. Mr. Cunow's object was so perfectly\r\nwithin our own views, that it was readily obtained, and I am in hopes\r\nhe has left us with a more correct opinion of the dispositions of the\r\nadministration than his fraternity has generally manifested. I have\r\nwithin a few days had visits from the Pottowatamies, Miamis, Chippewas,\r\nDelawares, and Cherokees, and there arrived some yesterday, of, I believe,\r\nthe Ottoways, Wiandots, and others of that neighborhood. Our endeavors are\r\nto impress on them all profoundly, temperance, peace, and agriculture; and\r\nI am persuaded they begin to feel profoundly the soundness of the advice.\r\n\r\nCongress seems as yet to have been able to make up no opinion. Some are\r\nfor taking off the embargo before they separate; others not till their\r\nmeeting next autumn; but both with a view to substitute war, if no change\r\ntakes place with the powers of Europe. A middle opinion is to have an\r\nextra session in May, to come then to a final decision. I have thought\r\nit right to take no part myself in proposing measures, the execution of\r\nwhich will devolve on my successor. I am therefore chiefly an unmeddling\r\nlistener to what others say. On the same ground, I shall make no new\r\nappointments which can be deferred till the 4th of March, thinking it fair\r\nto leave to my successor to select the agents for his own administration.\r\nAs the moment of my retirement approaches, I become more anxious for its\r\narrival, and to begin at length to pass what yet remains to me of life\r\nand health in the bosom of my family and neighbors, and in communication\r\nwith my friends, undisturbed by political concerns or passions. Permit me\r\nto avail myself of this occasion to assure Mrs. Logan and yourself of my\r\ncontinued friendship and attachment, and that I shall ever be pleased to\r\nhear of your happiness and prosperity, saluting you both with affection\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 28, 1808.\r\n\r\nI enclose you the petition of Jacob Smith of Newport, in the case\r\nof the ship Triumph, which is a new case to me. Perhaps the practice\r\nas to foreign ships arriving since the embargo laws, with which I am\r\nunacquainted, may facilitate the solution. What should be done?\r\n\r\n_The Atalanta._\r\n\r\nIs not the collector the person who is to search into the fact charged? I\r\ndo not know who it is that does this in case of seizure. However, I will\r\nsend the case to Mr. Smith.\r\n\r\nThe petition of Manuel Valder for a vessel to carry off Spanish subjects,\r\nis rejected.\r\n\r\nThe cases from St. Mary are really embarrassing. I sent the papers to\r\nMr. Madison to ask his opinion. He had read only one when he called on\r\nme this morning. He seemed strongly of opinion that it would be most\r\nadvisable to send some person to the Governor of East Florida, to enter\r\ninto some friendly arrangements with him. He has the papers still under\r\nconsideration; in the meantime we may consider as further means, how it\r\nmight do to destroy all boats and canoes on our side the river, paying\r\nfor them? To arrest impression, and bring to regular trial every negro\r\ntaken in the act of violating the laws? This for mere consideration.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RANDOLPH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 28, 1808.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday your favor of the 22d. It was the first\r\ninformation I had had of the sentence against Moss, the district attorney\r\nnot having written to me as you supposed. I referred the case to the Post\r\nMaster General, who in his answer says, \"His is not a single crime, but\r\na series of crimes, for months if not years. There were found upon him\r\nbetween $1,300 and $1,500, which he had robbed in small sums.\"\r\n\r\nYou are sensible that the Legislature having made stripes a regular part\r\nof the punishment, that the pardoning them cannot be a thing of course,\r\nas that would be to repeal the law, but that extraordinary and singular\r\nconsiderations are necessary to entitle the criminal to that remission.\r\nThe information of the Post Master General marks such an habitual\r\ndepravity of mind, as leaves little room to suppose that any facts can\r\ncountervail it; and the robbery of the mail has now become so frequent\r\nand great an evil, that the moment is unfavorable to propositions of\r\nrelaxation. Still I shall be ready to receive and consider any testimony\r\nin his favor, which his friends may bring forward, and will do it on\r\nwhatever I may believe to have been the intention of the Legislature in\r\nconfiding the power of pardon to the executive. The opinion of the judges\r\nwho sat in the cause, I have ever required as indispensable to ground\r\na pardon. A copy of the judgment is also necessary. I have taken the\r\nliberty of troubling you with these observations, because I have received\r\nno application but your letter, and lest, on the contrary supposition,\r\nhis case might suffer for want of information. Accept my salutations and\r\nassurances of friendly esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 31, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The General Government of the United States has considered it their\r\nduty and interest to extend their care and patronage over the Indian\r\ntribes within their limits, and to endeavor to render them friends, and\r\nin time perhaps useful members of the nation. Perceiving the injurious\r\neffects produced by their inordinate use of spirituous liquors, they\r\npassed laws authorizing measures against the vending or distributing\r\nsuch liquors among them. Their introduction by traders was accordingly\r\nprohibited, and for some time was attended with the best effects. I am\r\ninformed, however, that latterly the Indians have got into the practice\r\nof purchasing such liquors themselves in the neighboring settlements of\r\nwhites, and of carrying them into their towns, and that in this way our\r\nregulations so salutary to them, are now defeated. I must, therefore,\r\nrequest your Excellency to submit this matter to the consideration of your\r\nlegislature. I persuade myself that in addition to the moral inducements\r\nwhich will readily occur, they will find it not indifferent to their\r\nown interests to give us their aid in removing, for their neighbors,\r\nthis great obstacle to their acquiring industrious habits, and attaching\r\nthemselves to the regular and useful pursuits of life; for this purpose\r\nit is much desired that they should pass effectual laws to restrain their\r\ncitizens from vending and distributing spirituous liquors to the Indians.\r\nI pray your Excellency to accept the assurances of my great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HENRY GUEST.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 4, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--A constant pressure of business must be my apology for being so late\r\nin acknowledging the receipt of your favor of November 25th. I am sensible\r\nof the kindness of your rebuke on my determination to retire from office\r\nat a time when our country is laboring under difficulties truly great.\r\nBut if the principle of rotation be a sound one, as I conscientiously\r\nbelieve it to be with respect to this office, no pretext should ever be\r\npermitted to dispense with it, because there never will be a time when\r\nreal difficulties will not exist, and furnish a plausible pretext for\r\ndispensation. You suppose I am \"in the prime of life for rule.\" I am\r\nsensible I am not; and before I am so far declined as to become insensible\r\nof it, I think it right to put it out of my own power. I have the comfort\r\ntoo of knowing that the person whom the public choice has designated to\r\nreceive the charge from me, is eminently qualified as a safe depository by\r\nthe endowments of integrity, understanding, and experience. On a review\r\ntherefore of the reasons for my retirement, I think you cannot fail to\r\napprove them.\r\n\r\nYour proposition for preventing the effect of splinters in a naval action,\r\nwill certainly merit consideration and trial whenever our vessels shall\r\nbe called into serious service; till then the perishable nature of the\r\ncovering, would render it an unnecessary expense. I tender you my best\r\nwishes for the continuance of your life and health, and salute you with\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                           January 9, 1809.\r\n\r\nI do not recollect the instructions to Governor Lewis respecting\r\nsquatters. But if he had any they were unquestionably to prohibit them\r\nrigorously. I have no doubt, if he had not written instructions, that he\r\nwas verbally so instructed. Carr's story has very much the air of an idle\r\nrumor, willingly listened to. It shows some germ of discontent existing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY AT WAR.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 12, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have read with pleasure the letter of Captain Davidson, by which,\r\naccording to unanimous resolves of the company of light infantry of the\r\nfirst legion of the militia of Columbia commanded by him, he tenders their\r\nservices as volunteers under the Act of Congress of February 24th, 1807.\r\nI accept the offer, and render to Captain Davidson and the other officers\r\nand privates of the company, that praise to which their patriotism so\r\njustly entitles them. So long urged by the aggressions of the belligerent\r\npowers, and every measure of forbearance at length exhausted, our country\r\nmust see with sincere satisfaction the alacrity with which persons will\r\nflock to her standard whenever her constituted authorities shall declare\r\nthat we take into our own hands the redress of our wrongs. Be so good as\r\nto communicate in behalf of the public my thanks to Captain Davidson, the\r\nother officers and privates of his company, and be assured yourself of my\r\naffectionate respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 12, 1809.\r\n\r\nI suppose that in answering Governor Drayton we should compliment his\r\nardor, and smooth over our noncompliance with his request; that he might\r\nbe told that the President sees, in his present application, a proof\r\nof his vigilance and zeal in whatever concerns the public safety, and\r\nwill count with the more confidence on his future attentions and energy\r\nwhenever circumstances shall call for them. That he considers that the\r\npower entrusted to him for calling out the 100,000 militia, was meant to\r\nbe exercised only in the case of some great and general emergency, and by\r\nno means to be employed merely as garrisons or guards in ordinary cases:\r\nthat there is no apprehension that England means either to declare or to\r\ncommence war on us at the present moment, and that if the declaration\r\nshall be intended to originate with us, he may be assured of receiving\r\ntimely notice, with the powers and the means of placing everything in\r\nsafety before a state of actual danger commences; that nevertheless it is\r\nof great urgency that the quota of his state be prepared with all possible\r\ndiligence, to be ready to march at a moment's warning, because by that\r\ntime it is very possible, and scarcely improbable, that their services may\r\nhave become actually requisite. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR EUSTIS.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 14, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of\r\nDecember the 24th, and of the resolutions of the republican citizens\r\nof Boston, of the 19th of that month. These are worthy of the ancient\r\ncharacter of the sons of Massachusetts, and of the spirit of concord\r\nwith her sister States, which, and which alone, carried us successfully\r\nthrough the revolutionary war, and finally placed us under that national\r\ngovernment, which constitutes the safety of every part, by uniting for\r\nits protection the powers of the whole. The moment for exerting these\r\nunited powers, to repel the injuries of the belligerents of Europe,\r\nseems likely to be pressed upon us. They have interdicted our commerce\r\nwith nearly the whole world. They have declared it shall be carried on\r\nwith such places, in such articles, and in such measure only, as they\r\nshall dictate; thus prostrating all the principles of right which have\r\nhitherto protected it. After exhausting the cup of forbearance and\r\nconciliation to its dregs, we found it necessary, on behalf of that\r\ncommerce, to take time to call it home into a state of safety, to put\r\nthe towns and harbors which carry it on into a condition of defence, and\r\nto make further preparation for enforcing the redress of its wrongs, and\r\nrestoring it to its rightful freedom. This required a certain measure of\r\ntime, which, although not admitting specific limitation, must, from its\r\navowed objects, have been obvious to all; and the progress actually made\r\ntowards the accomplishment of these objects, proves it now to be near its\r\nterm. While thus endeavoring to secure, and preparing to vindicate that\r\ncommerce, the absurd opinion has been propagated, that this temporary and\r\nnecessary arrangement was to be a permanent system, and was intended for\r\nits destruction. The sentiments expressed in the paper you were so kind as\r\nto enclose to me, show that those who have concurred in them have judged\r\nwith more candor the intentions of their government, and are sufficiently\r\naware of the tendency of the excitements and misrepresentations which\r\nhave been practised on this occasion. And such, I am persuaded, will be\r\nthe disposition of the citizens of Massachusetts at large, whenever truth\r\ncan reach them. Associated with her sister States in a common government,\r\nthe fundamental principle of which is, that the will of the majority is\r\nto prevail, sensible that, in the present difficulty, that will has been\r\ngoverned by no local interests or jealousies, that, to save permanent\r\nrights, temporary sacrifices were necessary, that these have fallen as\r\nimpartially on all, as in a situation so peculiar they could be made to\r\ndo, she will see in the existing measures a legitimate and honest exercise\r\nof the will and wisdom of the whole. And her citizens, faithful to\r\nthemselves and their associates, will not, to avoid a transient pressure,\r\nyield to the seductions of enemies to their independence, foreign or\r\ndomestic, and take a course equally subversive of their well-being, as of\r\nthat of their brethren.\r\n\r\nThe approbation expressed by the republican citizens of the town of\r\nBoston, of the course pursued by the national government, is truly\r\nconsoling to its members; and, encouraged by the declaration of the\r\ncontinuance of their confidence, and by the assurance of their support,\r\nthey will continue to pursue the line of their high duties according to\r\nthe best of their understandings, and with undeviating regard to the good\r\nof the whole. Permit me to avail myself of this occasion of tendering you\r\npersonally the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS C. JAMES, SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 14, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,-I have received your favor of the 6th inst., informing me that the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society had been pleased, at their late election,\r\nunanimously to re-elect me president of the society. In desiring, in my\r\nletter to the vice-presidents, that I might be permitted to withdraw\r\nfrom that honor, I acted from a conscientious persuasion that I was\r\nkeeping from that important station members whose position, as well as\r\nqualifications, would enable them to render more effectual services to\r\nthe institution. But the society having thought proper again to name me,\r\nI shall obey it with dutifulness, and be ever anxious to avail myself of\r\nevery occasion of being useful to them. I pray you to be so good as to\r\ncommunicate my thanks to them, with assurances of my devotion to their\r\nservice, and to accept those of great esteem and respect for yourself\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR MAESE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 15, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,-The constant pressure of such business as will admit no delay, has\r\nprevented my sooner acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 2d,\r\nand even now will confine me to the single question, for the answer to\r\nwhich you wait, before you take any step towards bringing forward the\r\ninstitution you propose for the advancement of the arts. That question is\r\nwhether Congress would grant a charter of incorporation, and a sum for\r\npremiums annually? It has always been denied by the republican party in\r\nthis country, that the Constitution had given the power of incorporation\r\nto Congress. On the establishment of the Bank of the United States,\r\nthis was the great ground on which that establishment was combatted;\r\nand the party prevailing supported it only on the argument of its being\r\nan incident to the power given them for raising money. On this ground\r\nit has been acquiesced in, and will probably be again acquiesced in, as\r\nsubsequently confirmed by public opinion. But in no other instance have\r\nthey ever exercised this power of incorporation out of this district, of\r\nwhich they are the ordinary legislature.\r\n\r\nIt is still more settled that among the purposes to which the Constitution\r\npermits them to apply money, the granting premiums or bounties is not\r\nenumerated, and there has never been a single instance of their doing it,\r\nalthough there has been a multiplicity of applications. The Constitution\r\nhas left these encouragements to the separate States. I have in two or\r\nthree messages recommended to Congress an amendment to the Constitution,\r\nwhich should extend their power to these objects. But nothing is yet\r\ndone in it. I fear, therefore, that the institution you propose must rest\r\non the patronage of the State in which it is to be. I wish I could have\r\nanswered you more to my own mind; as well as yours; but truth is the first\r\nobject. I salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR, TO THE GOVERNORS,--PREPARED BY\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 17, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The pressure of the embargo, although sensibly felt by every\r\ndescription of our fellow citizens, has yet been cheerfully borne by\r\nmost of them, under the conviction that it was a temporary evil, and\r\na necessary one to save us from greater and more permanent evils,--the\r\nloss of property and surrender of rights. But it would have been more\r\ncheerfully borne, but for the knowledge that, while honest men were\r\nreligiously observing it, the unprincipled along our sea-coast and\r\nfrontiers were fraudulently evading it; and that in some parts they had\r\neven dared to break through it openly, by an armed force too powerful to\r\nbe opposed by the collector and his assistants. To put an end to this\r\nscandalous insubordination to the laws, the Legislature has authorized\r\nthe President to empower proper persons to employ militia, for preventing\r\nor suppressing armed or riotous assemblages of persons resisting the\r\ncustom-house officers in the exercise of their duties, or opposing or\r\nviolating the embargo laws. He sincerely hopes that, during the short time\r\nwhich these restrictions are expected to continue, no other instances\r\nwill take place of a crime of so deep a die. But it is made his duty to\r\ntake the measures necessary to meet it. He therefore requests you, as\r\ncommanding officer of the militia of your State, to appoint some officer\r\nof the militia, of known respect for the laws, in or near to each port of\r\nentry within your State, with orders, when applied to by the collector of\r\nthe district, to assemble immediately a sufficient force of his militia,\r\nand to employ them efficaciously to maintain the authority of the laws\r\nrespecting the embargo, and that you notify to each collector the officer\r\nto whom, by your appointment, he is so to apply for aid when necessary. He\r\nhas referred this appointment to your Excellency, because your knowledge\r\nof characters, or means of obtaining it, will enable you to select one\r\nwho can be most confided in to exercise so serious a power, with all the\r\ndiscretion, the forbearance, the kindness even, which the enforcement\r\nof the law will possibly admit,--ever to bear in mind that the life of a\r\ncitizen is never to be endangered, but as the last melancholy effort for\r\nthe maintenance of order and obedience to the laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOYD.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 20, 1809.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his compliments to Mr. Boyd, and observes that\r\nthe enclosed petition of Nicholas Kosieg, has been addressed to Judge\r\nCranch, and yet is not recommended by him or the other judges who sat\r\non the trial. They are so particularly qualified by having heard the\r\nevidence, to decide on the merits of the petition, that Thomas Jefferson\r\nhas generally made the recommendation of judges the foundation of pardon,\r\nand sees no reason in the present case to depart from that rule. He\r\nassures Mr. Boyd of his esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR TYLER.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 20, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Secretary at War has put into my hand your Excellency's letter\r\nof January 9th, covering one of December 15th from Captain Henry St.\r\nJohn Dixon, of the volunteer riflemen of the 105th regiment, offering the\r\nservice of his company for one year. The term for which the offer is made\r\nshows it intended to be under the Act of Congress of February 24th, 1807,\r\nand not under that of March 30th, 1805, which is only for a service of six\r\nmonths under the law of 1807. The Governors were authorized and requested,\r\non behalf of the President, to accept the offers made under that act,\r\nand to organize the corps when ready for it, officering it according to\r\nthe laws of their State. This authority was given to your predecessor,\r\nand was considered as devolving on yourself. The authority and request\r\nare now renewed to you, and the letter of Captain Dixon returned for that\r\npurpose. To this I will add another request, that you will be so good as\r\nto endeavor to have a return made to the War Office of all the corps of\r\ntwelve-month volunteers which have been accepted in Virginia. They began\r\nimmediately after the attack on the Chesapeake. I salute you with esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HUMPHREYS.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 20, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of December 12th,\r\nand to return you my thanks for the cloth furnished me. It came in good\r\ntime, and does honor to your manufactory, being as good as any one would\r\nwish to wear in any country. Amidst the pressure of evils with which the\r\nbelligerent edicts have afflicted us, some permanent good will arise; the\r\nspring given to manufactures will have durable effects. Knowing most of my\r\nown State, I can affirm with confidence that were free intercourse opened\r\nagain to-morrow, she would never again import one-half of the coarse goods\r\nwhich she has done down to the date of the edicts. These will be made in\r\nour families. For finer goods we must resort to the larger manufactories\r\nestablished in the towns. Some jealousy of this spirit of manufacture\r\nseems excited among commercial men. It would have been as just when we\r\nfirst began to make our own ploughs and hoes. They have certainly lost\r\nthe profit of bringing these from a foreign country. My idea is that we\r\nshould encourage home manufactures to the extent of our own consumption\r\nof everything of which we raise the raw material. I do not think it fair\r\nin the ship-owners to say we ought not to make our own axes, nails, &c.,\r\nhere, that they may have the benefit of carrying the iron to Europe,\r\nand bringing back the axes, nails, &c. Our agriculture will still afford\r\nsurplus produce enough to employ a due proportion of navigation. Wishing\r\nevery possible success to your undertaking, as well for your personal\r\nas the public benefit. I salute you with assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LEIPER.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 21, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 15th was duly received, and before that,\r\nTowers' book, which you had been so kind as to send me, had come to hand,\r\nfor which I pray you to receive my thanks. You judge rightly that _here_\r\nI have no time to read. A cursory view of the book shows me that the\r\nauthor is a man of much learning in his line. I have heard of some other\r\nlate writer, (the name I forget,) who has undertaken to prove contrary\r\nevents from the same sources; and particularly that England is not to\r\nbe put down; and that this is the favorite author in that country. As to\r\nmyself, my religious reading has long been confined to the moral branch\r\nof religion, which is the same in all religions; while in that branch\r\nwhich consists of dogmas, all differ, all have a different set. The former\r\ninstructs us how to live well and worthily in society; the latter are made\r\nto interest our minds in the support of the teachers who inculcate them.\r\nHence, for one sermon on a moral subject, you hear ten on the dogmas of\r\nthe sect. However, religion is not the subject for you and me; neither of\r\nus know the religious opinions of the other; that is a matter between our\r\nMaker and ourselves. We understand each other better in politics, to which\r\ntherefore I will proceed. The House of Representatives passed last night\r\na bill for the meeting of Congress on the 22d of May. This substantially\r\ndecides the course they mean to pursue; that is, to let the embargo\r\ncontinue till then, when it will cease, and letters of marque and reprisal\r\nbe issued against such nations as shall not then have repealed their\r\nobnoxious edicts. The great majority seem to have made up their minds\r\non this, while there is considerable diversity of opinion on the details\r\nof preparation; to wit: naval force, volunteers, army, non-intercourse,\r\n&c. I write freely to you, because I know that in stating facts, you\r\nwill not quote names. You know that every syllable uttered in my name\r\nbecomes a text for the federalists to torment the public mind on by their\r\nparaphrases and perversions. I have lately inculcated the encouragement\r\nof manufactures to the extent of our own consumption at least, in all\r\narticles of which we raise the raw material. On this the federal papers\r\nand meetings have sounded the alarm of Chinese policy, destruction of\r\ncommerce, &c.; that is to say, the iron which we make must not be wrought\r\nhere into ploughs, axes, hoes, &c., in order that the ship-owner may\r\nhave the profit of carrying it to Europe, and bringing it back in a\r\nmanufactured form, as if after manufacturing our own raw materials for\r\nown use, there would not be a surplus produce sufficient to employ a due\r\nproportion of navigation in carrying it to market and exchanging it for\r\nthose articles of which we have not the raw material. Yet this absurd hue\r\nand cry has contributed much to federalize New England, their doctrine\r\ngoes to the sacrificing agriculture and manufactures to commerce; to the\r\ncalling all our people from the interior country to the sea-shore to turn\r\nmerchants, and to convert this great agricultural country into a city\r\nof Amsterdam. But I trust the good sense of our country will see that\r\nits greatest prosperity depends on a due balance between agriculture,\r\nmanufactures and commerce, and not in this protuberant navigation which\r\nhas kept us in hot water from the commencement of our government, and\r\nis now engaging us in war. That this may be avoided, if it can be done\r\nwithout a surrender of rights, is my sincere prayer. Accept the assurances\r\nof my constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL CHARLES SIMMS, COLLECTOR.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 22, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received last night your letter of yesterday, and this being a\r\nday in which all the offices are shut, and the case admitting no delay, I\r\nenclose you a special order, directly from myself, to apply for aid of the\r\nmilitia adjacent to the vessel, to enable you to do your duty as to the\r\nsloop loading with flour. But I must desire that, so far as the agency of\r\nthe militia be employed, it may be with the utmost discretion, and with no\r\nact of force beyond what shall be necessary to maintain obedience to the\r\nlaws, using neither deeds nor words unnecessarily offensive. I salute you\r\nwith respect.\r\n\r\n[_The Order enclosed._]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n                                                             January, 1809.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO WIT,--Information being received that a sloop,\r\nsaid to be of one of the eastern States, of about 1,500 barrels burthen,\r\nis taking in flour in the Bay of Occoquan in Virginia, with intention\r\nto violate the several embargo laws, and the urgency of the case not\r\nadmitting the delay of the ordinary course of proceeding through the\r\norders of the Governors of the States, I have therefore thought proper\r\nto issue these my special orders to the militia officers of the counties\r\nof Fairfax, Prince William, or of any other county of Virginia, or of\r\nMaryland, adjacent to the river Potomak or any of its waters, wherein the\r\nsaid vessel may be found, and to such particular officer especially to\r\nwhom these my orders shall be presented by any collector of the customs,\r\nfor any district on the said river or its waters, or by any person acting\r\nunder their authority, forthwith on receiving notice, to call out such\r\nportion of the militia under his or their command as shall be sufficient,\r\nand to proceed with the same, in aid of the said collector, to take\r\npossession of the said sloop and her cargo, wheresoever found in the said\r\nwaters, and to detain the same until she shall be liberated according to\r\nlaw, for which this shall be his and their warrant.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand at Washington, this 22d day of January, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 18th was received in due time, and the answer\r\nhas been delayed as well by a pressure of business, as by the expectation\r\nof your absence from Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe idea of sending a special mission to France or England is not\r\nentertained at all here. After so little attention to us from the former,\r\nand so insulting an answer from Canning, such a mark of respect as an\r\nextraordinary mission, would be a degradation against which all minds\r\nrevolt here. The idea was hazarded in the House of Representatives a\r\nfew days ago, by a member, and an approbation expressed by another, but\r\nrejected indignantly by every other person who spoke, and very generally\r\nin conversation by all others; and I am satisfied such a proposition\r\nwould get no vote in the Senate. The course the Legislature means to\r\npursue, may be inferred from the act now passed for a meeting in May, and\r\na proposition before them for repealing the embargo in June, and then\r\nresuming and maintaining by force our right of navigation. There will\r\nbe considerable opposition to this last proposition, not only from the\r\nfederalists, old and new, who oppose everything, but from sound members\r\nof the majority. Yet it is believed it will obtain a good majority, and\r\nthat it is the only proposition which can be devised that could obtain\r\na majority of any kind. Final propositions will, therefore, be soon\r\ndespatched to both the belligerents through the resident ministers, so\r\nthat their answers will be received before the meeting in May, and will\r\ndecide what is to be done. This last trial for peace is not thought\r\ndesperate. If, as is expected, Bonaparte should be successful in Spain,\r\nhowever every virtuous and liberal sentiment revolts at it, it may induce\r\nboth powers to be more accommodating with us. England will see here the\r\nonly asylum for her commerce and manufactures, worth more to her than her\r\norders of council. And Bonaparte, having Spain at his feet, will look\r\nimmediately to the Spanish colonies, and think our neutrality cheaply\r\npurchased by a repeal of the illegal parts of his decrees, with perhaps\r\nthe Floridas thrown into the bargain. Should a change in the aspect of\r\naffairs in Europe produce this disposition in both powers, our peace and\r\nprosperity may be revived and long continue. Otherwise, we must again take\r\nthe tented field, as we did in 1776 under more inauspicious circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere never has been a situation of the world before, in which such\r\nendeavors as we have made would not have secured our peace. It is probable\r\nthere never will be such another. If we go to war now, I fear we may\r\nrenounce forever the hope of seeing an end of our national debt. If we can\r\nkeep at peace eight years longer, our income, liberated from death, will\r\nbe adequate to any war, without new taxes or loans, and our position and\r\nincreasing strength put us _hors d'insulte_ from any nation. I am now so\r\nnear the moment of retiring, that I take no part in affairs beyond the\r\nexpression of an opinion. I think it fair that my successor should now\r\noriginate those measures of which he will be charged with the execution\r\nand responsibility, and that it is my duty to clothe them with the forms\r\nof authority. Five weeks more will relieve me from a drudgery to which I\r\nam no longer equal, and restore me to a scene of tranquillity, amidst my\r\nfamily and friends, more congenial to my age and natural inclinations.\r\nIn that situation, it will always be a pleasure to me to see you, and to\r\nrepeat to you the assurances of my constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SEVIER.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 31, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The extraordinary and critical situation of our foreign relations\r\nrendering it necessary, in the opinion of the National Legislature, that\r\ntheir next recess should be short, they have passed an act for meeting on\r\nthe fourth Monday of May, of which I enclose you a copy. As the election\r\nof representatives for the State of Tennessee would not, in the ordinary\r\ncourse, be in time for this meeting, I have thought it my duty to make\r\nyou a special communication of this law. That every State should be\r\nrepresented in the great council of the nation, is not only the interest\r\nof each, but of the whole united, who have a right to be aided by the\r\ncollective wisdom and information of the whole, in questions which are to\r\ndecide on their future well-being. I trust that your Excellency will deem\r\nit incumbent on you to call an immediate meeting of your legislature, in\r\norder to put it in their power to fulfil this high duty, by making special\r\nand timely provision for the representation of their State at the ensuing\r\nmeeting of Congress; to which measures I am bound earnestly to exhort\r\nyourself and them. I am not insensible of the personal inconvenience of\r\nthis special call to the members composing the legislature of so extensive\r\na State; but neither will I do them the injustice to doubt their being\r\nready to make much greater sacrifices for the common safety, should\r\nthe course of events still lead to a call for them. I tender to your\r\nExcellency the assurances of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. AMELOT DE LA CROIX, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received in due time your favor of December 28th, covering\r\nthe tragedy of the unfortunate Louis XVI., and I am sure you are too\r\nreasonable not to have ascribed the delay of answer which has intervened,\r\nto its true cause, the never-ceasing pressure of business which cannot\r\nbe deferred. I have read the piece with great satisfaction. I recognize\r\nin Louis that purity of virtue and sincere patriotism which I knew made a\r\npart of his real character. The sound good sense and exalted sentiments he\r\nis made to utter, were proper to his character, whether actually a part of\r\nit or not. I say nothing of style, not doubting its merit, and conscious\r\nI am no judge of it in a foreign language. I believe it impossible, in\r\nany but our native tongue, to be so thoroughly sensible of the delicacy of\r\nstyle, which constitutes an essential merit in poetical composition, as to\r\ncriticise them with correctness.\r\n\r\nI wish that, in the prefatory piece, the character which is the subject\r\nof it, did not fall still further short of its representation than that of\r\nthe principal personage in the main piece. I have never claimed any other\r\nmerit than of good intentions, sensible that in the choice of measures,\r\nerror of judgment has too often had its influence; and with whatever\r\nindulgence my countrymen as well as yourself, have been so kind as to\r\nview my course, yet they would certainly not know me in the picture here\r\ndrawn, and would, I fear, say in the words of the poet, \"Praise undeserved\r\nis satire in disguise.\" Were, therefore, the piece to be prepared for the\r\npress, I should certainly entreat you to revise that part with a severe\r\neye.\r\n\r\nI believe I mentioned to you, on a former occasion, that the late act of\r\nCongress for raising additional troops required that the officers should\r\nall be citizens of the United States. Should there be war, however, I am\r\npersuaded this policy must be abandoned, and that we must avail ourselves\r\nof the experience of other nations, in certain lines of service at least.\r\nIn that expectation I shall leave with my successor the papers in my\r\npossession, from which he may be sensible of the benefits he may receive\r\nfrom your aid.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept my salutations and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN ARMISTEAD T. MASON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 3d, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of January 7th came to my hand on the 23d only of that\r\nmonth, since which the pressure of business which could not be delayed,\r\nhas prevented my sooner acknowledging its receipt. The offer of service\r\ntherein made by the subscribing members of the troop of cavalry, attached\r\nto the 57th regiment of Virginia militia under your command, is worthy of\r\nthat ardent love of our country which, I am persuaded, will distinguish\r\nits citizens, whenever its wrongs shall call them to the field. I tender,\r\ntherefore, to the subscribing officers and members of the troop that\r\nacknowledgment of their merit which is so justly due. At the same time,\r\nI must observe that, considering their offer of service as made under the\r\nlaw of 1808, the power of accepting it is thereby given to the governor of\r\nthe State, to whom their address for acceptance is of course to be made.\r\nA bill for raising a body of volunteers is now on its progress through\r\nCongress. Should that be passed, which will soon be known, it may perhaps\r\nbe more eligible for the subscribing members to place themselves under the\r\nconditions of that law. I pray you to accept, for them and yourself, the\r\nassurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN ARMISTEAD T. MASON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 3d, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I enclose you a letter in answer to that in which you offer the\r\nservices of the subscribing members of your troop of cavalry. I make this\r\nseparate and private answer to the very friendly letter addressed to me in\r\nyour own name only, and which accompanied the former. The relation which\r\nyou bear to my most valued and worthy friend Stevens T. Mason, gives you\r\na just title to communicate your wishes to me, and will insure to you any\r\nservices I can render you. The time of my continuance in office is now\r\nso short, that it will scarcely fall to my lot to be useful to you, but\r\nI shall leave your letter in the hands of my successor, than whom nobody\r\ncherishes more the memory of your father. If the bill mentioned in my\r\nother letter passes, there will be little difficulty in your obtaining\r\nappointment. The engagements that proposes are to be for one year from the\r\ntime the volunteers are called on, which will not be till war is declared,\r\nor inevitable, and from that corps a transfer will be easy into the\r\nregular troops, which in that case will be to be raised.\r\n\r\nI am happy in every testimony from my fellow citizens, that my conduct in\r\nthe discharge of my duties to them, has given them satisfaction. Accept my\r\nthanks for the very kind terms in which you have been pleased to express\r\nyour dispositions towards myself, and with a request that you will be\r\nso good as to present my high respects to Mrs. Mason, with whom I have\r\nhad the happiness of some acquaintance, I salute you with friendship and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS MANN RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 7, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thought Congress had taken their ground firmly for continuing\r\ntheir embargo till June, and then war. But a sudden and unaccountable\r\nrevolution of opinion took place the last week, chiefly among the New\r\nEngland and New York members, and in a kind of panic they voted the 4th\r\nof March for removing the embargo, and by such a majority as gave all\r\nreason to believe they would not agree either to war or non-intercourse.\r\nThis, too, was after we had become satisfied that the Essex Junto had\r\nfound their expectation desperate, of inducing the people there to\r\neither separation or forcible opposition. The majority of Congress,\r\nhowever, has now rallied to the removing the embargo on the 4th of March,\r\nnon-intercourse with _France_ and _Great Britain_, trade everywhere else,\r\nand continuing war preparations. The further details are not yet settled,\r\nbut I believe it is perfectly certain that the embargo will be taken off\r\nthe 4th of March. Present my warmest affections to my dearest Martha, and\r\nthe young ones, and accept the assurances of them to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR TYLER.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 16, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 11th, covering resolutions of\r\nthe General Assembly of Virginia on our foreign relations, and an address\r\nto myself, on my approaching retirement; and I ask leave, through the same\r\nchannel, to return the enclosed answer. Nothing can give me more sincere\r\nsatisfaction than this kind and honorable testimony from the General\r\nAssembly of my native State,--a State in which I have drawn my first and\r\nshall draw my latest breath, and to which I retire with inexpressible\r\npleasure. I am equally sensible of your goodness, in the approving terms\r\nin which you have made this communication. The concurrence of a veteran\r\npatriot, who from the first dawn of the revolution to this day has pursued\r\nunchangeably the same honest course, cannot but be flattering to his\r\nfellow laborers. I pray you to accept the assurances of my sincere esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. STODDART.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 18, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of January 25th had been duly received, and I was waiting\r\nin the hope I might find a moment of less pressure in which I might answer\r\nit somewhat in detail, when that of the 14th inst. came to hand. Finding\r\nthat, instead of any relaxation of business, it crowds more on me as I\r\napproach my departure, I can only indulge myself in a very brief reply. As\r\nto the rights of the United States as a neutral power, our opinions are\r\nvery different, mine being that when two nations go to war, it does not\r\nabridge the rights of neutral nations but in the two articles of blockade\r\nand contraband of war. But on this subject we have both probably read and\r\nthought so much as to have made up our minds, and it is not likely that\r\neither can make a convert of the other. With respect to the interests of\r\nthe United States in this exuberant commerce which is now bringing war on\r\nus, we concur perfectly. It brings us into collision with other powers in\r\nevery sea, and will force us into every war of the European powers. The\r\nconverting this great agricultural country into a city of Amsterdam,--a\r\nmere head-quarters for carrying on the commerce of all nations with\r\none another, is too absurd. Yet this is the real object of the drawback\r\nsystem,--it enriches a few individuals, but lessens the stock of native\r\nproductions, by withdrawing from them all the hands thus employed; it is\r\nessentially interesting to us to have shipping and seamen enough to carry\r\nour surplus produce to market; but beyond that, I do not think we are\r\nbound to give it encouragement by drawbacks or other premiums. I wish you\r\nmay be right in supposing that the trading States would now be willing\r\nto give up the drawbacks, and to denationalize all ships taking foreign\r\narticles on board for any other destination than the United States, on\r\nbeing secured by discriminating duties, or otherwise in the exclusive\r\ncarryage of the produce of the United States. I should doubt it. Were such\r\na proposition to come _from them_, I presume it would meet with little\r\ndifficulty. Otherwise, I suppose it must wait till peace, when the right\r\nof drawback will be less valued than the exclusive carryage of our own\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nNo apology was necessary for the letters you were so kind as to write me\r\non this subject. I have always received with thankfulness the ideas of\r\njudicious persons on subjects interesting to the public. In the present\r\ncase, I thought I should better fulfil your objects by communicating your\r\nletters to my successor, to whose views I have thought it my duty to give\r\nthe lead, ever since his designation, as to all matters which he would\r\nhave to execute. Nothing will probably be done on this subject in the\r\nfew days between this and my retirement; and in that situation I shall\r\ncertainly divorce myself from all part in political affairs. To get rid\r\nof them is the principal object of my retirement, and the first thing\r\nnecessary to the happiness which, you justly observe, it is in vain to\r\nlook for in any other situation. I pray you to accept my salutations, and\r\nassurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN HOLLINS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 19, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A little transaction of mine, as innocent a one as I ever\r\nentered into, and where an improper construction was never less expected,\r\nis making some noise, I observe, in your city. I beg leave to explain\r\nit to you, because I mean to ask your agency in it. The last year, the\r\nAgricultural Society of Paris, of which I am a member, having had a plough\r\npresented to them, which, on trial with a graduated instrument, did equal\r\nwork with half the force of their best ploughs, they thought it would\r\nbe a benefit to mankind to communicate it. They accordingly sent one to\r\nme, with a view to its being made known here, and they sent one to the\r\nDuke of Bedford also, who is one of their members, to be made use of for\r\nEngland, although the two nations were then at war. By the Mentor, now\r\ngoing to France, I have given permission to two individuals in Delaware\r\nand New York, to import two parcels of Merino sheep from France, which\r\nthey have procured there, and to some gentlemen in Boston, to import a\r\nvery valuable machine which spins cotton, wool, and flax equally. The last\r\nspring, the Society informed me they were cultivating the cotton of the\r\nLevant and other parts of the Mediterranean, and wished to try also that\r\nof our southern States. I immediately got a friend to have two tierces\r\nof seed forwarded to me. They were consigned to Messrs. Falls and Brown\r\nof Baltimore, and notice of it being given me, I immediately wrote to\r\nthem to re-ship them to New York, to be sent by the Mentor. Their first\r\nobject was to make a show of my letter, as something very criminal, and\r\nto carry the subject into the newspapers. I had, on a like request, some\r\ntime ago, (but before the embargo,) from the President of the Board of\r\nAgriculture of London, of which I am also a member, to send them some of\r\nthe genuine May wheat of Virginia, forwarded to them two or three barrels\r\nof it. General Washington, in his time, received from the same Society\r\nthe seed of the perennial succory, which Arthur Young had carried over\r\nfrom France to England, and I have since received from a member of it the\r\nseed of the famous turnip of Sweden, now so well known here. I mention\r\nthese things, to show the nature of the correspondence which is carried on\r\nbetween societies instituted for the benevolent purpose of communicating\r\nto all parts of the world whatever useful is discovered in any one of\r\nthem. These societies are always in peace, however their nations may be at\r\nwar. Like the republic of letters, they form a great fraternity spreading\r\nover the whole earth, and their correspondence is never interrupted by\r\nany civilized nation. Vaccination has been a late and remarkable instance\r\nof the liberal diffusion of a blessing newly discovered. It is really\r\npainful, it is mortifying, to be obliged to note these things, which are\r\nknown to every one who knows anything, and felt with approbation by every\r\none who has any feeling. But we have a faction, to whose hostile passions\r\nthe torture even of right into wrong is a delicious gratification. Their\r\nmalice I have long learned to disregard, their censure to deem praise.\r\nBut I observe that some republicans are not satisfied (even while we are\r\nreceiving liberally from others) that this small return should be made.\r\nThey will think more justly at another day; but, in the meantime, I wish\r\nto avoid offence. My prayer to you, therefore, is, that you will be so\r\ngood, under the enclosed order, as to receive these two tierces of seed\r\nfrom Falls and Brown, and pay them their disbursements for freight, &c.,\r\nwhich I will immediately remit you on knowing the amount. Of the seed,\r\nwhen received, be so good as to make manure for your garden. When rotted\r\nwith a due mixture of stable manure or earth, it is the best in the world.\r\nI rely on your friendship to excuse this trouble, it being necessary I\r\nshould not commit myself again to persons of whose honor, or the want of\r\nit, I know nothing.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. GREGOIRE, EVEQUE ET SENATEUR A PARIS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 25, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received the favor of your letter of August 17th, and with it\r\nthe volume you were so kind as to send me on the \"Literature of Negroes.\"\r\nBe assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I do, to\r\nsee a complete refutation of the doubts I have myself entertained and\r\nexpressed on the grade of understanding allotted to them by nature, and\r\nto find that in this respect they are on a par with ourselves. My doubts\r\nwere the result of personal observation on the limited sphere of my own\r\nState, where the opportunities for the development of their genius were\r\nnot favorable, and those of exercising it still less so. I expressed them\r\ntherefore with great hesitation; but whatever be their degree of talent\r\nit is no measure of their rights. Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior\r\nto others in understanding, he was not therefore lord of the person or\r\nproperty of others. On this subject they are gaining daily in the opinions\r\nof nations, and hopeful advances are making towards their re-establishment\r\non an equal footing with the other colors of the human family. I pray you\r\ntherefore to accept my thanks for the many instances you have enabled me\r\nto observe of respectable intelligence in that race of men, which cannot\r\nfail to have effect in hastening the day of their relief; and to be\r\nassured of the sentiments of high and just esteem and consideration which\r\nI tender to yourself with all sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. RUELLE, ANCIEN AGENT DIPLOMATIQUE, RUE D'ARGENTINE, NO. 38, A PARIS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 25, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favors of May 29th and July 11th, and\r\nwith this last a copy of your Constitution with the new augmentations. Our\r\nusages not permitting me to present it formally to the Legislature of the\r\nnation, I have deposited it in their library, where all its members will\r\nhave an opportunity of profiting of its truths, and it will be, as you\r\ndesire, in a depôt beyond the reach of violence. No interests are dearer\r\nto men than those which ought to be secured to them by their form of\r\ngovernment, and none deserve better of them than those who contribute to\r\nthe amelioration of that form. The consciousness of having deserved well\r\nof mankind for your endeavors to be useful to them in this line, will be\r\nitself a high reward, to which will be added the homage of those who shall\r\nhave reaped the benefits of them. I ask permission on my part to tender\r\nyou the assurances of my esteem and great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS MANN RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--By yesterday's mail I learn that it would be the desire\r\nof many of the good citizens of our country to meet me on the road on\r\nmy return home, as a manifestation of their good will. But it is quite\r\nimpossible for me to ascertain the day on which I shall leave this. The\r\naccumulated business at the close of a session will prevent my making any\r\npreparation for my departure till after the 4th of March. After that, the\r\narrangement of papers and business to be delivered over to my successor,\r\nthe winding up my own affairs, and clearing out from this place, will\r\nemploy me for several days, (I cannot conjecture even how many,) so as to\r\nrender the commencement, and consequently the termination of my journey,\r\naltogether uncertain. But it is a sufficient happiness to me to know\r\nthat my fellow-citizens of the country generally entertain for me the\r\nkind sentiments which have prompted this proposition, without giving to\r\nso many the trouble of leaving their homes to meet a single individual.\r\nI shall have opportunities of taking them individually by the hand at\r\nour court-house and other public places, and of exchanging assurances of\r\nmutual esteem. Certainly it is the greatest consolation to me to know,\r\nthat in returning to the bosom of my native country, I shall be again\r\nin the midst of their kind affections: and I can say with truth that my\r\nreturn to them will make me happier than I have been since I left them.\r\nNothing will be wanting on my part to merit the continuance of their\r\ngood will. The House of Representatives passed yesterday, by a vote\r\nof 81 to 40, the bill from the Senate repealing the embargo the 4th of\r\nMarch, except against Great Britain and France and their dependencies,\r\nestablishing a non-intercourse with them, and having struck out the\r\nclause for letters of marque and reprisal, which it is thought the Senate\r\nwill still endeavor to reinstate. I send you a paper containing the last\r\nSpanish news. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. GREGG AND LEIB, SENATORS OF PENNSYLVANIA.--MR. SMILIE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 2, 1809.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I have just received the enclosed with a request that I would\r\nlay it before both Houses of Congress. But I have never presumed to place\r\nmyself between the Legislative Houses and those who have a constitutional\r\nright to address them directly. I take the liberty therefore of enclosing\r\nthe paper to you, that you may do therein what in your judgment shall best\r\ncomport with expediency and propriety.\r\n\r\nI pray you to be assured of my high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 2, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of May 2d; since which I have received yours\r\nof May the 25th, June the 1st, July the 23d, 24th, and September the 5th,\r\nand distributed the two pamphlets according to your desire. They are read\r\nwith the delight which everything from your pen gives.\r\n\r\nAfter using every effort which could prevent or delay our being entangled\r\nin the war of Europe, that seems now our only resource. The edicts of\r\nthe two belligerents, forbidding us to be seen on the ocean, we met by an\r\nembargo. This gave us time to call home our seamen, ships and property,\r\nto levy men and put our seaports into a certain state of defence. We have\r\nnow taken off the embargo, except as to France and England and their\r\nterritories, because fifty millions of exports, annually sacrificed,\r\nare the treble of what war would cost us; besides, that by war we\r\nshould take something, and lose less than at present. But to give you\r\na true description of the state of things here, I must refer you to Mr.\r\nColes, the bearer of this, my secretary, a most worthy, intelligent and\r\nwell-informed young man, whom I recommend to your notice, and conversation\r\non our affairs. His discretion and fidelity may be relied on. I expect\r\nhe will find you with Spain at your feet, but England still afloat, and a\r\nbarrier to the Spanish colonies. But all these concerns I am now leaving\r\nto be settled by my friend Mr. Madison. Within a few days I retire to my\r\nfamily, my books and farms; and having gained the harbor myself, I shall\r\nlook on my friends still buffeting the storm with anxiety indeed, but\r\nnot with envy. Never did a prisoner, released from his chains, feel such\r\nrelief as I shall on shaking off the shackles of power. Nature intended\r\nme for the tranquil pursuits of science, by rendering them my supreme\r\ndelight. But the enormities of the times in which I have lived, have\r\nforced me to take a part in resisting them, and to commit myself on the\r\nboisterous ocean of political passions. I thank God for the opportunity\r\nof retiring from them without censure, and carrying with me the most\r\nconsoling proofs of public approbation. I leave everything in the hands\r\nof men so able to take care of them, that if we are destined to meet\r\nmisfortunes, it will be because no human wisdom could avert them. Should\r\nyou return to the United States, perhaps your curiosity may lead you to\r\nvisit the hermit of Monticello. He will receive you with affection and\r\ndelight; hailing you in the meantime with his affectionate salutations and\r\nassurances of constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. If you return to us, bring a couple of pair of true-bred shepherd's\r\ndogs. You will add a valuable possession to a country now beginning to pay\r\ngreat attention to the raising sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL ARMSTRONG.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 5, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--This will be handed you by Mr. Coles, the bearer of public\r\ndespatches, by an _aviso_. He has lived with me as Secretary, is my\r\nwealthy neighbor at Monticello, and worthy of all confidence. His intimate\r\nknowledge of our situation has induced us to send him, because he will\r\nbe a full supplement as to all those things which cannot be detailed in\r\nwriting. He can possess you of our present situation much more intimately\r\nthan you can understand it from letters. The belligerent edicts rendered\r\nour embargo necessary to call home our ships, our seamen, and property.\r\nWe expected some effect too from the coercion of interest. Some it has\r\nhad; but much less on account of evasions, and domestic opposition to it.\r\nAfter fifteen months' continuance it is now discontinued, because, losing\r\n$50,000,000 of exports annually by it, it costs more than war, which might\r\nbe carried on for a third of that, besides what might be got by reprisal.\r\nWar therefore must follow if the edicts are not repealed before the\r\nmeeting of Congress in May. You have thought it advisable sooner to take\r\npossession of adjacent territories. But we know that they are ours the\r\nfirst moment that any war is forced upon us for other causes, that we are\r\nat hand to anticipate their possession, if attempted by any other power,\r\nand, in the meantime, we are lengthening the term of our prosperity,\r\nliberating our revenues, and increasing our power. I suppose Napoleon will\r\nget possession of Spain; but her colonies will deliver themselves to any\r\nmember of the Bourbon family. Perhaps Mexico will choose its sovereign\r\nwithin itself. He will find them much more difficult to subdue than\r\nAustria or Prussia; because an enemy (even in peace an enemy) possesses\r\nthe element over which he is to pass to get at them; and a more powerful\r\nenemy (climate) will soon mow down his armies after arrival. This will\r\nbe, without any doubt, the most difficult enterprise the emperor has ever\r\nundertaken. He may subdue the small colonies; he never can the old and\r\nstrong; and the former will break off from him the first war he has again\r\nwith a naval power.\r\n\r\nI thank you for having procured for me the Dynamometer which I have safely\r\nreceived, as well as the plough. Mr. Coles will reimburse what you were\r\nso kind as to advance for me on that account. The letters which will be\r\nwritten you by the new Secretary of State (Mr. Smith) will say to you what\r\nis meant to be official. For although I too have written on politics,\r\nit is merely as a private individual, which I am now happily become.\r\nWithin two or three days I retire from scenes of difficulty, anxiety, and\r\nof contending passions, to the elysium of domestic affections, and the\r\nirresponsible direction of my own affairs. Safe in port myself, I shall\r\nlook anxiously at my friends still buffeting the storm, and wish you all\r\nsafe in port also. With my prayers for your happiness and prosperity,\r\naccept the assurances of my sincere friendship and great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. LE BARON HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 6, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received safely your letter of May 30th, and with it your\r\nastronomical work and Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain, for\r\nwhich I return you my sincere thanks. I had before heard that this work\r\nhad begun to appear, and the specimen I have received proves that it will\r\nnot disappoint the expectations of the learned. Besides making known to\r\nus one of the most singular and interesting countries on the globe, one\r\nalmost locked up from the knowledge of man hitherto, precious additions\r\nwill be made to our stock of physical science, in many of its parts. We\r\nshall bear to you therefore the honorable testimony that you have deserved\r\nwell of the republic of letters.\r\n\r\nYou mention that you had before written other letters to me. Be assured\r\nI have never received a single one, or I should not have failed to make\r\nmy acknowledgments of it. Indeed I have not waited for that, but for the\r\ncertain information, which I had not, of the place where you might be.\r\nYour letter of May 30th first gave me that information. You have wisely\r\nlocated yourself in the focus of the science of Europe. I am held by the\r\ncords of love to my family and country, or I should certainly join you.\r\nWithin a few days I shall now bury myself in the groves of Monticello,\r\nand become a mere spectator of the passing events. On politics I will\r\nsay nothing, because I would not implicate you by addressing to you the\r\nrepublican ideas of America, deemed horrible heresies by the royalism\r\nof Europe. You will know before this reaches you, that Mr. Madison is my\r\nsuccessor. This ensures to us a wise and honest administration. I salute\r\nyou with sincere friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 8, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is with much concern I inform you that the Senate has\r\nnegatived your appointment. We thought it best to keep back the nomination\r\nto the close of the session, that the mission might remain secret as long\r\nas possible, which you know was our purpose from the beginning. It was\r\nthen sent in with an explanation of its object and motives. We took for\r\ngranted, if any hesitation should arise, that the Senate would take time,\r\nand that our friends in that body would make inquiries of us, and give us\r\nthe opportunity of explaining and removing objections. But to our great\r\nsurprise, and with an unexampled precipitancy, they rejected it at once.\r\nThis reception of the last of my official communications to them, could\r\nnot be unfelt, nor were the causes of it spoken out by them. Under this\r\nuncertainty, Mr. Madison, on his entering into office, proposed another\r\nperson, (John Q. Adams.) He also was negatived, and they adjourned _sine\r\ndie_. Our subsequent information was that, on your nomination, your\r\nlong absence from this country, and their idea that you do not intend to\r\nreturn to it, had very sensible weight; but that all other motives were\r\nsuperseded by an unwillingness to extend our diplomatic connections, and\r\na desire even to recall the foreign ministers we already have. All were\r\nsensible of the great virtues, the high character, the powerful influence,\r\nand valuable friendship of the emperor. But riveted to the system of\r\nunentanglement with Europe, they declined the proposition. On this subject\r\nyou will receive the official explanations from Mr. Smith, the Secretary\r\nof State. I pray you to place me _rectus in curiâ_ in this business\r\nwith the emperor, and to assure him that I carry into my retirement the\r\nhighest veneration for his virtues, and fondly cherish the belief that his\r\ndispositions and power are destined by heaven to better, in some degree at\r\nleast, the condition of oppressed man.\r\n\r\nI have nothing new to inform you as to your private friends or\r\nacquaintances. Our embargo has worked hard. It has in fact federalized\r\nthree of the New England States. Connecticut you know was so before. We\r\nhave substituted for it a non-intercourse with France and England and\r\ntheir dependencies, and a trade to all other places. It is probable the\r\nbelligerents will take our vessels under their edicts, in which case we\r\nshall probably declare war against them.\r\n\r\nI write this in the midst of packing and preparing for my departure,\r\nof visits of leave, and interruptions of every kind. I must therefore\r\nconclude with my affectionate adieu to you, and assurances of my constant\r\nattachment and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 17, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On opening my letters from France, in the moment of my\r\ndeparture from Washington, I found from their signatures that they were\r\nfrom literary characters, except one from Mr. Short, which mentioned in\r\nthe outset that it was private, and that his public communications were in\r\nthe letter to the Secretary of State, which I sent you. I find, however,\r\non reading his letter to me (which I did not do till I got home) a\r\npassage of some length proper to be communicated to you, and which I have\r\ntherefore extracted.\r\n\r\nI had a very fatiguing journey, having found the roads excessively bad,\r\nalthough I have seen them worse. The last three days I found it better\r\nto be on horseback, and travelled eight hours through as disagreeable a\r\nsnow storm as I was ever in. Feeling no inconvenience from the expedition\r\nbut fatigue, I have more confidence in my _vis vitæ_, than I had before\r\nentertained. The spring is remarkably backward. No oats sown, not\r\nmuch tobacco seed, and little done in the gardens. Wheat has suffered\r\nconsiderably. No vegetation visible yet but the red maple, weeping willow\r\nand lilac. Flour is said to be at eight dollars at Richmond, and all\r\nproduce is hurrying down.\r\n\r\nI feel great anxiety for the occurrences of the ensuing four or five\r\nmonths. If peace can be preserved, I hope and trust you will have a smooth\r\nadministration. I know no government which would be so embarrassing in\r\nwar as ours. This would proceed very much from the lying and licentious\r\ncharacter of our papers; but much, also, from the wonderful credulity of\r\nthe members of Congress in the floating lies of the day. And in this no\r\nexperience seems to correct them. I have never seen a Congress during\r\nthe last eight years, a great majority of which I would not implicitly\r\nhave relied on in any question, could their minds have been purged of all\r\nerrors of fact. The evil, too, increases greatly with the protraction of\r\nthe session, and I apprehend, in case of war, their session would have a\r\ntendency to become permanent. It is much, therefore, to be desired that\r\nwar may be avoided, if circumstances will admit. Nor in the present maniac\r\nstate of Europe, should I estimate the point of honor by the ordinary\r\nscale. I believe we shall, on the contrary, have credit with the world,\r\nfor having made the avoidance of being engaged in the present unexampled\r\nwar, our first object. War, however, may become a less losing business\r\nthan unresisted depredation. With every wish that events may be propitious\r\nto your administration, I salute you with sincere affection and every\r\nsympathy of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM M'ANDLESS, ESQ., PITTSBURG.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 29, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received on the evening of the 1st of March the resolutions\r\nenclosed in your letter of February 20th, for the purpose of being laid\r\nbefore both Houses of Congress. Usage, and perhaps sound principle, not\r\npermitting the President to place himself between the representatives\r\nand their constituents, who have a right to address their Legislature\r\ndirectly, I delivered the next day a copy of your resolutions to a member\r\nof Pennsylvania in each House of Congress. But as that body was to rise\r\non the day ensuing that, the mass of indispensable business crowding on\r\nthe last moments of the Session scarcely admitted the opportunity of a\r\ncompliance with your wishes.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion of returning sincere thanks for the\r\nkind dispositions towards myself expressed in your letter, and for\r\nthe sentiments which it conveys, of approbation of my conduct in the\r\nadministration of the public affairs. If that conduct has met the general\r\napprobation of my country, it is the highest reward I can receive; and I\r\nshall ever feel towards them that gratitude which the confidence they have\r\nfavored me with so eminently calls for. Accept for yourself the assurances\r\nof my high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE INHABITANTS OF ALBEMARLE COUNTY, IN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                             April 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nReturning to the scenes of my birth and early life, to the society\r\nof those with whom I was raised, and who have been ever dear to me, I\r\nreceive, fellow citizens and neighbors, with inexpressible pleasure, the\r\ncordial welcome you are so good as to give me. Long absent on duties which\r\nthe history of a wonderful era made incumbent on those called to them,\r\nthe pomp, the turmoil, the bustle and splendor of office, have drawn but\r\ndeeper sighs for the tranquil and irresponsible occupations of private\r\nlife, for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with you, my\r\nneighbors and friends, and the endearments of family love, which nature\r\nhas given us all, as the sweetener of every hour. For these I gladly lay\r\ndown the distressing burthen of power, and seek, with my fellow citizens,\r\nrepose and safety under the watchful cares, the labors and perplexities\r\nof younger and abler minds. The anxieties you express to administer to my\r\nhappiness, do, of themselves, confer that happiness; and the measure will\r\nbe complete, if my endeavors to fulfil my duties in the several public\r\nstations to which I have been called, have obtained for me the approbation\r\nof my country. The part which I have acted on the theatre of public life,\r\nhas been before them; and to their sentence I submit it; but the testimony\r\nof my native county, of the individuals who have known me in private life,\r\nto my conduct in its various duties and relations, is the more grateful,\r\nas proceeding from eye witnesses and observers, from triers of the\r\nvicinage. Of you, then, my neighbors, I may ask, in the face of the world,\r\n\"whose ox have I taken, or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed,\r\nor of whose hand have I received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?\" On\r\nyour verdict I rest with conscious security. Your wishes for my happiness\r\nare received with just sensibility, and I offer sincere prayers for your\r\nown welfare and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR JAMES JAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 7, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of February 27th came to hand on the 3d of March.\r\nThe occupations of the moment and of those which have followed must be my\r\napology for this late acknowledgment. The plan of civilizing the Indians\r\nis undoubtedly a great improvement on the ancient and totally ineffectual\r\none of beginning with religious missionaries. Our experience has shown\r\nthat this must be the last step of the process. The following is what\r\nhas been successful: 1st, to raise cattle, &c., and thereby acquire a\r\nknowledge of the value of property; 2d, arithmetic, to calculate that\r\nvalue; 3d, writing, to keep accounts, and here they begin to enclose\r\nfarms, and the men to labor, the women to spin and weave; 4th, to read\r\n\"Æsop's Fables\" and \"Robinson Crusoe\" are their first delight. The Creeks\r\nand Cherokees are advanced thus far, and the Cherokees are now instituting\r\na regular government.\r\n\r\nAn equilibrium of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, is certainly\r\nbecome essential to our independence. Manufactures, sufficient for our own\r\nconsumption, of what we raise the raw material, (and no more.) Commerce\r\nsufficient to carry the surplus produce of agriculture, beyond our own\r\nconsumption, to a market for exchanging it for articles we cannot raise,\r\n(and no more.) These are the true limits of manufactures and commerce. To\r\ngo beyond them is to increase our dependence on foreign nations, and our\r\nliability to war.\r\n\r\nThese three important branches of human industry will then grow together,\r\nand be really handmaids to each other. I salute you with great respect and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL LARKIN SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 15, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your very friendly letter of March 28th,\r\nand am extremely sensible to the kind spirit it breathes. To be praised\r\nby those who themselves deserve all praise, is a gratification of high\r\norder. Their approbation who, having been high in office themselves, have\r\ninformation and talents to guide their judgment, is a consolation deeply\r\nfelt. A conscientious devotion to republican government, like charity in\r\nreligion, has obtained for me much indulgence from my fellow citizens,\r\nand the aid of able counsellors has guided me through many difficulties\r\nwhich have occurred. The troubles in the East have been produced by\r\nEnglish agitators, operating on the selfish spirit of commerce, which\r\nknows no country, and feels no passion or principle but that of gain.\r\nThe inordinate extent given it among us by our becoming the factors\r\nof the whole world, has enabled it to control the agricultural and\r\nmanufacturing interests. When a change of circumstances shall reduce it\r\nto an equilibrium with these, to the carrying _our_ produce only, to be\r\nexchanged for _our_ wants, it will return to a wholesome condition for the\r\nbody politic, and that beyond which it should never more be encouraged to\r\ngo. The repeal of the drawback system will either effect this, or bring\r\nsufficient sums into the treasury to meet the wars we shall bring on by\r\nour covering every sea with our vessels. But this must be the work of\r\npeace. The correction will be after my day, as the error originated before\r\nit. I thank you sincerely for your kind good wishes, and offer my prayers\r\nfor your health and welfare, with every assurance of my great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nP. S. I thank you for the information of your letter of the 4th, this\r\nmoment received. I sincerely wish the British orders may be repealed.\r\nIf they are, it will be because the nation will not otherwise let the\r\nministers keep their places. Their object has unquestionably been fixed\r\nto establish the Algerine system, and to maintain their possession of the\r\nocean by a system of piracy against all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 19, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge your favor of the 9th, and to thank you\r\nfor the political information it contained. Reading the newspapers but\r\nlittle and that little but as the romance of the day, a word of truth\r\nnow and then comes like the drop of water on the tongue of Dives. If\r\nthe British ministry are changing their policy towards us, it is because\r\ntheir nation, or rather the city of London, which is the nation to them,\r\nis shaken as usual, by the late reverses in Spain. I have for some time\r\nbeen persuaded that the government of England was systematically decided\r\nto claim a dominion of the sea, and to levy contributions on all nations,\r\nby their licenses to navigate, in order to maintain that dominion to\r\nwhich their own resources are inadequate. The mobs of their cities are\r\nunprincipled enough to support this policy in prosperous times, but change\r\nwith the tide of fortune, and the ministers, to keep their places, change\r\nwith them. I wish Mr. Oakley may not embarrass you with his conditions of\r\nrevoking the orders of council. Enough of the non-importation law should\r\nbe reserved, 1st, to pinch them into a relinquishment of impressments, and\r\n2d, to support those manufacturing establishments which their orders, and\r\nour interests, forced us to make.\r\n\r\nI suppose the conquest of Spain will soon force a delicate question on you\r\nas to the Floridas and Cuba, which will offer themselves to you. Napoleon\r\nwill certainly give his consent without difficulty to our receiving the\r\nFloridas, and with some difficulty possibly Cuba. And though he will\r\ndisregard the obligation whenever he thinks he can break it with success,\r\nyet it has a great effect on the opinion of our people and the world to\r\nhave the moral right on our side, of his agreement as well as that of the\r\npeople of those countries.\r\n\r\nMr. Hackley's affair is really unfortunate. He has been driven into\r\nthis arrangement by his distresses, which are great. He is a perfectly\r\nhonest man, as is well known here where he was born, but unaccustomed to\r\npolitical subjects, he has not seen it in that view. But a respect for the\r\ninnocence of his views cannot authorize the sanction of government to such\r\nan example.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 27, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 24th came to hand last night. The correspondence\r\nbetween Mr. Smith and Mr. Erskine had been received three days before. I\r\nsincerely congratulate you on the change it has produced in our situation.\r\nIt is the source of very general joy here, and could it have arrived one\r\nmonth sooner would have had important effects, not only on the elections\r\nof other States, but of this also, from which it would seem that wherever\r\nthere was any considerable portion of federalism it has been so much\r\nreinforced by those of whose politics the price of wheat is the sole\r\nprinciple, that federalists will be returned from many districts of this\r\nState. The British ministry has been driven from its Algerine system, not\r\nby any remaining morality in the people, but by their unsteadiness under\r\nsevere trial. But whencesoever it comes, I rejoice in it as the triumph of\r\nour forbearing and yet persevering system. It will lighten your anxieties,\r\ntake from Cabal its most fertile ground of war, will give us peace during\r\nyour time, and by the complete extinguishment of our public debt, open\r\nupon us the noblest application of revenue that has ever been exhibited\r\nby any nation. I am sorry they are sending a minister to attempt a treaty.\r\nThey never made an equal commercial treaty with any nation, and we have no\r\nright to expect to be the first. It will place you between the injunctions\r\nof true patriotism and the clamors of a faction devoted to a foreign\r\ninterest, in preference to that of their own country. It will confirm\r\nthe English too in their practice of whipping us into a treaty. They did\r\nit in Jay's case, were near it in Monroe's, and on failure of that, have\r\napplied the scourge with tenfold vigor, and now come on to try its effect.\r\nBut it is the moment when we should prove our consistence, by recurring to\r\nthe principles we dictated to Monroe, the departure from which occasioned\r\nour rejection of his treaty, and by protesting against Jay's treaty being\r\never quoted, or looked at, or even mentioned. That form will forever be a\r\nmillstone round our necks unless we now rid ourselves of it once for all.\r\nThe occasion is highly favorable, as we never can have them more in our\r\npower.\r\n\r\nAs to Bonaparte, I should not doubt the revocation of his edicts, were\r\nhe governed by reason. But his policy is so crooked that it eludes\r\nconjecture. I fear his first object now is to dry up the sources of\r\nBritish prosperity by excluding her manufactures from the continent. He\r\nmay fear that opening the ports of Europe to our vessels will open them\r\nto an inundation of British wares. He ought to be satisfied with having\r\nforced her to revoke the orders on which he pretended to retaliate, and\r\nto be particularly satisfied with us, by whose unyielding adherence to\r\nprinciple she has been forced into the revocation. He ought the more\r\nto conciliate our good will, as we can be such an obstacle to the new\r\ncareer opening on him in the Spanish colonies. That he would give us the\r\nFloridas to withhold intercourse with the residue of those colonies,\r\ncannot be doubted. But that is no price; because they are ours in the\r\nfirst moment of the first war; and until a war they are of no particular\r\nnecessity to us. But, although with difficulty, he will consent to our\r\nreceiving Cuba into our Union, to prevent our aid to Mexico and the other\r\nprovinces. That would be a price, and I would immediately erect a column\r\non the southernmost limit of Cuba, and inscribe on it a _ne plus ultra_\r\nas to us in that direction. We should then have only to include the north\r\nin our Confederacy, which would be of course in the first war, and we\r\nshould have such an empire for liberty as she has never surveyed since\r\nthe creation; and I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well\r\ncalculated as ours for extensive empire and self-government. As the Mentor\r\nwent away before this change, and will leave France probably while it is\r\nstill a secret in that hemisphere, I presume the expediency of pursuing\r\nher by a swift sailing despatch was considered. It will be objected\r\nto our receiving Cuba, that no limit can then be drawn to our future\r\nacquisitions. Cuba can be defended by us without a navy, and this develops\r\nthe principle which ought to limit our views. Nothing should ever be\r\naccepted which would require a navy to defend it.\r\n\r\nOur Spring continues cold and backward, rarely one growing day without two\r\nor three cold ones following. Wheat is of very various complexions from\r\nvery good to very bad. Fruit has not suffered as much as was expected,\r\nexcept in peculiar situations. Gardens are nearly a month behind their\r\nusual state. I thank you for the squashes from Maine; they shall be\r\nplanted to-day. I salute you with sincere and constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SPAFFORD.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 14, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of April 3d, with the copy of\r\nyour \"General Geography,\" for which I pray you to accept my thanks. My\r\noccupations here have not permitted me to read it through, which alone\r\ncould justify any judgment expressed on the work. Indeed, as it appears to\r\nbe an abridgment of several branches of science, the scale of abridgment\r\nmust enter into that judgment. Different readers require different scales\r\naccording to the time they can spare, and their views in reading, and\r\nno doubt that the view of the sciences which you have brought into the\r\ncompass of a 12mo volume will be accommodated to the time and object of\r\nmany who may wish for but a very general view of them.\r\n\r\nIn passing my eye rapidly over parts of the book, I was struck with two\r\npassages, on which I will make observations, not doubting your wish, in\r\nany future edition, to render the work as correct as you can. In page 186\r\nyou say the potatoe is a native of the United States. I presume you speak\r\nof the Irish potatoe. I have inquired much into the question, and think I\r\ncan assure you that plant is not a native of North America. Zimmerman, in\r\nhis \"Geographical Zoology,\" says it is a native of Guiana; and Clavigero,\r\nthat the Mexicans got it from South America, _its native country_. The\r\nmost probable account I have been able to collect is, that a vessel of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh's, returning from Guiana, put into the west of Ireland in\r\ndistress, having on board some potatoes which they called earth-apples.\r\nThat the season of the year, and circumstance of their being already\r\nsprouted, induced them to give them all out there, and they were no more\r\nheard or thought of, till they had been spread considerably into that\r\nisland, whence they were carried over into England, and therefore called\r\nthe Irish potatoe. From England they came to the United States, bringing\r\ntheir name with them.\r\n\r\nThe other passage respects the description of the passage of the Potomac\r\nthrough the Blue Ridge, in the Notes on Virginia. You quote from Volney's\r\naccount of the United States what his words do not justify. His words\r\nare, \"on coming from Fredericktown, one does not see the rich perspective\r\nmentioned in the Notes of Mr. Jefferson. On observing this to him a few\r\ndays after, he informed me he had his information from a French engineer\r\nwho, during the war of Independence, ascended the height of the hills, and\r\nI conceive that at that elevation the perspective must be as imposing as a\r\nwild country, whose horizon has no obstacles, may present.\" That the scene\r\ndescribed in the \"Notes\" is not visible from any part of the road from\r\nFredericktown to Harper's ferry is most certain. That road passes along\r\nthe valley, nor can it be seen from the tavern after crossing the ferry;\r\nand we may fairly infer that Mr. Volney did not ascend the height back\r\nof the tavern from which alone it can be seen, but that he pursued his\r\njourney from the tavern along the high road. Yet he admits, that at the\r\nelevation of that height the perspective may be as rich as a wild country\r\ncan present. But you make him \"surprised to find, _by a view of the spot_,\r\nthat the description was _amazingly exaggerated_.\" But it is evident that\r\nMr. Volney did not ascend the hill to _get a view of the spot_, and that\r\nhe supposed that that height may present as imposing a view as such a\r\ncountry admits. But Mr. Volney was mistaken in saying I told him I had\r\nreceived the description from a French engineer. By an error of memory\r\nhe has misapplied to this scene what I mentioned to him as to the Natural\r\nBridge. I told him I received a _drawing_ of that from a French engineer\r\nsent there by the Marquis de Chastellux, and who has published that\r\ndrawing in his travels. I could not tell him I had the description of the\r\npassage of the Potomac from a French engineer, because I never heard any\r\nFrenchman say a word about it, much less did I ever receive a description\r\nof it from any mortal whatever. I visited the place myself in October\r\n1783, wrote the description some time after, and printed the work in Paris\r\nin 1784-5. I wrote the description from my own view of the spot, stated no\r\nfact but what I saw, and can now affirm that no fact is exaggerated. It is\r\ntrue that the same scene may excite very different sensations in different\r\nspectators, according to their different sensibilities. The sensations\r\nof some may be much stronger than those of others. And with respect to\r\nthe Natural Bridge, it was not a description, but a drawing only, which\r\nI received from the French engineer. The description was written before I\r\never saw him. It is not from any merit which I suppose in either of these\r\ndescriptions, that I have gone into these observations, but to correct\r\nthe imputation of having given to the world as my own, ideas, and false\r\nones too, which I had received from another. Nor do I mention the subject\r\nto you with a desire that it should be any otherwise noticed before the\r\npublic than by a more correct statement in any future edition of your\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nYou mention having enclosed to me some printed letters announcing a\r\ndesign in which you ask my aid. But no such letters came to me. Any facts\r\nwhich I possess, and which may be useful to your views, shall be freely\r\ncommunicated, and I shall be happy to see you at Monticello, should you\r\ncome this way as you propose. You will find me engaged entirely in rural\r\noccupations, looking into the field of science but occasionally and at\r\nvacant moments.\r\n\r\nI sowed some of the Benni seed the last year, and distributed some among\r\nmy neighbors; but the whole was killed by the September frost. I got a\r\nlittle again the last winter, but it was sowed before I received your\r\nletter. Colonel Fen of New York receives quantities of it from Georgia,\r\nfrom whom you may probably get some through the Mayor of New York. But\r\nI little expect it can succeed with you. It is about as hardy as the\r\ncotton plant, from which you may judge of the probability of raising it at\r\nHudson.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN WYCHE.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 19, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of March 19th came to hand but a few days ago, and\r\ninforms me of the establishment of the Westward Mill Library Society,\r\nof its general views and progress. I always hear with pleasure of\r\ninstitutions for the promotion of knowledge among my countrymen. The\r\npeople of every country are the only safe guardians of their own rights,\r\nand are the only instruments which can be used for their destruction. And\r\ncertainly they would never consent to be so used were they not deceived.\r\nTo avoid this, they should be instructed to a certain degree. I have\r\noften thought that nothing would do more extensive good at small expense\r\nthan the establishment of a small circulating library in every county,\r\nto consist of a few well-chosen books, to be lent to the people of the\r\ncounty, under such regulations as would secure their safe return in due\r\ntime. These should be such as would give them a general view of other\r\nhistory, and particular view of that of their own country, a tolerable\r\nknowledge of Geography, the elements of Natural Philosophy, of Agriculture\r\nand Mechanics. Should your example lead to this, it will do great good.\r\nHaving had more favorable opportunities than fall to every man's lot\r\nof becoming acquainted with the best books on such subjects as might be\r\nselected, I do not know that I can be otherwise useful to your society\r\nthan by offering them any information respecting these which they might\r\nwish. My services in this way are freely at their command, and I beg leave\r\nto tender to yourself my salutations and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JUDGE WOODWARD.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 27, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received, very thankfully, the two copies of your pamphlet\r\non the constitution of the U. S., and shall certainly read them with\r\npleasure. I had formerly looked with great interest to the experiment\r\nwhich was going on in France of an executive Directory, while that of\r\na single elective executive was under trial here. I thought the issue\r\nof them might fairly decide the question between the two modes. But the\r\nuntimely fate of that establishment cut short the experiment.\r\n\r\nI have not, however, been satisfied whether the dissensions of that\r\nDirectory (and which I fear are incident to a plurality) were not the most\r\neffective cause of the successful usurpations which overthrew them. It\r\nis certainly one of the most interesting questions to a republican, and\r\nworthy of great consideration. I thank you for the friendly expressions of\r\nyour letter towards myself personally, and the sincere happiness I enjoy\r\nhere, satisfies me that nothing personal or self-interested entered into\r\nmy motives for continuing in the public service. The actual experiment\r\nproves to me that these were all in favor of returning to my present\r\nsituation. I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. W. LAMBERT.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of March 14th was received in due time. The apology\r\nfor so late an acknowledgment of it must be the multiplied occupations\r\nof my new situation after so long an absence from it. Truth requires me\r\nto add, also, that after being so long chained to the writing table,\r\nI go to it with reluctance, and listen with partiality to every call\r\nfrom any other quarter. I have not, however, been the less sensible of\r\nthe kind sentiments expressed in your letter, nor the less thankful for\r\nthem. Indeed I owe infinite acknowledgments to the republican portion\r\nof my fellow citizens for the indulgence with which they have viewed my\r\nproceedings generally. In the transaction of their affairs I never felt\r\nan interested motive. The large share I have enjoyed, and still enjoy\r\nof anti-republican hatred and calumny, gives me the satisfaction of\r\nsupposing that I have been some obstacle to anti-republican designs; and\r\nif truth should find its way into history, the object of these falsehoods\r\nand calumnies will render them honorable to me. With sincere wishes for\r\nyour welfare and happiness, I tender you the assurances of my esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR ELIJAH GRIFFITH, PHILA.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of Nov. 14th came to me in due time, but much\r\noppressed with business then and to the end of my political term, I put\r\nit by as I did the civilities of my other friends, till the leisure I\r\nexpected here should permit me to acknowledge them without the neglect\r\nof any public duty. I am very sensible of the kindness of the sentiments\r\nexpressed in your letter, and of the general indulgence with which my\r\nrepublican friends generally, and those of Pennsylvania particularly,\r\nhave received my public proceedings. I hope I may be allowed to say\r\nthat they were always directed by a single view to the best interests of\r\nour country. In the electoral election, Pennsylvania really spoke in a\r\nvoice of thunder to the monarchists of our country, and while that State\r\ncontinues so firm, with the solid mass of republicanism to the South and\r\nWest, such efforts as we have lately seen in the anti-republican portion\r\nof our country cannot ultimately affect our security. Our enemies may try\r\ntheir cajoleries with my successor. They will find him as immovable in his\r\nrepublican principles as him whom they have honored with their peculiar\r\nenmity. The late pacification with England gives us a hope of eight years\r\nof peaceable and wise administration, within which time our revenue will\r\nbe liberated from debt, and be free to commence that splendid course of\r\npublic improvement and wise application of the public contributions, of\r\nwhich it remains for us to set the first example. I salute you with real\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. ROBERT SMITH, SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 10, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a letter from Mr. Smith of Erie, one of the\r\nmembers of Pennsylvania, which you will readily perceive ought to have\r\nbeen addressed to you by himself; as it is official and not personal\r\nopinion which can answer his views. I am however gratified by his mistake\r\nin sending it to me, inasmuch as it gives me an opportunity of abstracting\r\nmyself from my rural occupations, and of saluting one with whom I have\r\nbeen connected in service and in society so many years, and to whose aid\r\nand relief on an important portion of the public cares, I have been so\r\nmuch indebted. I do it with sincere affection and gratitude, and look back\r\nwith peculiar satisfaction on the harmony and cordial good will which, to\r\nourselves and to our brethren of the cabinet, so much sweetened our toils.\r\nFrom the characters now associated in the administration, I have no doubt\r\nof the continuance of the same cordiality so interesting to themselves and\r\nto the public; and great as are the difficulties and dangers environing\r\nour camp, I sleep with perfect composure, knowing who are watching for\r\nus. I pray you to present me respectfully to Mrs. Smith, and to accept\r\nmy prayers that you may long continue in the enjoyment of health and the\r\npublic esteem in return for your useful services past and to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 13, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I did not know till Mr. Patterson called on us, a few days\r\nago, that you had passed on to Washington. I had recently observed\r\nin the debates of Congress, a matter introduced, on which I wished to\r\ngive explanations more fully in conversation, which I will now do by\r\nabridgement in writing. Mr. Randolph has proposed an inquiry into certain\r\nprosecutions at common law in Connecticut, for libels on the government,\r\nand not only himself but others have stated them with such affected\r\ncaution, and such hints at the same time, as to leave on every mind\r\nthe impression that they had been instituted either by my direction, or\r\nwith my acquiescence, at least. This has not been denied by my friends,\r\nbecause probably the fact is unknown to them. I shall state it for their\r\nsatisfaction, and leave it to be disposed of as they think best.\r\n\r\nI had observed in a newspaper, (some years ago, I do not recollect the\r\ntime exactly,) some dark hints of a prosecution in Connecticut, but so\r\nobscurely hinted that I paid little attention to it. Some considerable\r\ntime after, it was again mentioned, so that I understood that some\r\nprosecution was going on in the federal court there, for calumnies uttered\r\nfrom the pulpit against me by a clergyman. I immediately wrote to Mr.\r\nGranger, who, I think, was in Connecticut at the time, stating that I\r\nhad laid it down as a law to myself, to take no notice of the thousand\r\ncalumnies issued against me, but to trust my character to my own conduct,\r\nand the good sense and candor of my fellow citizens; that I had found\r\nno reason to be dissatisfied with that course, and I was unwilling it\r\nshould be broke through by others as to any matter concerning me; and I\r\ntherefore requested him to desire the district attorney to dismiss the\r\nprosecution. Some time after this, I heard of subpœnas being served on\r\nGeneral Lee, David M. Randolph, and others, as witnesses to attend the\r\ntrial. I then for the first time conjectured the subject of the libel.\r\nI immediately wrote to Mr. Granger, to require an immediate dismission\r\nof the prosecution. The answer of Mr. Huntington, the district attorney,\r\nwas, that these subpœnas had been issued by the defendant without his\r\nknowledge, that it had been his intention to dismiss all the prosecutions\r\nat the first meeting of the court, and to accompany it with an avowal\r\nof his opinion, that they could not be maintained, because the federal\r\ncourt had no jurisdiction over libels. This was accordingly done. I did\r\nnot till then know that there were other prosecutions of the same nature,\r\nnor do I now know what were their subjects. But all went off together;\r\nand I afterwards saw in the hands of Mr. Granger, a letter written by\r\nthe clergyman, disavowing any personal ill will towards me, and solemnly\r\ndeclaring he had never uttered the words charged. I think Mr. Granger\r\neither showed me, or said there were affidavits of at least half a\r\ndozen respectable men, who were present at the sermon and swore no such\r\nexpressions were uttered, and as many equally respectable who swore the\r\ncontrary. But the clergyman expressed his gratification at the dismission\r\nof the prosecution. I write all this from memory, and after too long an\r\ninterval of time to be certain of the exactness of all the details; but I\r\nam sure there is no variation material, and Mr. Granger, correcting small\r\nlapses of memory, can confirm every thing substantial. Certain it is, that\r\nthe prosecution had been instituted, and had made considerable progress,\r\nwithout my knowledge, that they were disapproved by me as soon as known,\r\nand directed to be discontinued. The attorney did it on the same ground\r\non which I had acted myself in the cases of Duane, Callendar, and others;\r\nto wit, that the sedition law was unconstitutional and null, and that my\r\nobligation to execute what was law, involved that of not suffering rights\r\nsecured by valid laws, to be prostrated by what was no law. I always\r\nunderstood that these prosecutions had been invited, if not instituted,\r\nby Judge Edwards, and the marshal being republican, had summoned a grand\r\njury partly or wholly republican; but that Mr. Huntington declared from\r\nthe beginning against the jurisdiction of the court, and had determined to\r\nenter _nolle prosequis_ before he received my directions.\r\n\r\nI trouble you with another subject. The law making my letters post free,\r\ngoes to those _to me_ only, not those _from_ me. The bill had got to\r\nits passage before this was observed (and first I believe by Mr. Dana),\r\nand the House under too much pressure of business near the close of\r\nthe session to bring in another bill. As the privilege of freedom was\r\ngiven to the letters _from_ as well as _to_ both my predecessors, I\r\nsuppose no reason exists for making a distinction. And in so extensive\r\na correspondence as I am subject to, and still considerably on public\r\nmatters, it would be a sensible convenience to myself, as well as those\r\nwho have occasion to receive letters from me. It happens too, as I was\r\ntold at the time, (for I have never looked into it myself,) that it was\r\ndone by two distinct acts on both the former occasions. Mr. Eppes, I\r\nthink, mentioned this to me. I know from the Post Master General, that\r\nMr. Adams franks all his letters. I state this matter to you as being\r\nmy representative, which must apologize for the trouble of it. We have\r\nbeen seasonable since you left us. Yesterday evening and this morning we\r\nhave had refreshing showers, which will close and confirm the business of\r\nplanting. Affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 14, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--So entirely are my habits changed from constant labor at\r\nmy writing table, to constant active occupation without door, that it is\r\nwith difficulty I can resolve to take up my pen. I must do it, however,\r\nas a matter of duty to thank you for the dumb-fish you have been so kind\r\nas to have forwarded, and which are received safely and are found to be\r\nexcellent. I do it with pleasure also, as it gives me an opportunity\r\nof renewing to you the assurances of my esteem, and of the friendship\r\nI shall ever bear you as a faithful fellow-laborer in the duties of\r\nthe Cabinet, the value of whose aid there has been always justly felt\r\nand highly estimated by me. I sincerely congratulate you on the late\r\npacification with England, which while it gives facility and remuneration\r\nto your labors in your new functions, restores calm in a great degree to\r\nthe troubles of our country. Our successors have deserved well of their\r\ncountry in meeting so readily the first friendly advance ever made to\r\nus by England. I hope it is the harbinger of a return to the exercise\r\nof common sense and common good humor, with a country with which mutual\r\ninterests would urge a mutual and affectionate intercourse. But her\r\nconduct hitherto has been towards us so insulting, so tyrannical and so\r\nmalicious, as to indicate a contempt for our opinions or dispositions\r\nrespecting her. I hope she is now coming over to a wiser conduct, and\r\nbecoming sensible how much better it is to cultivate the good will of\r\nthe government itself, than of a faction hostile to it; to obtain its\r\nfriendship gratis than to purchase its enmity by nourishing at great\r\nexpense a faction to embarrass it, to receive the reward of an honest\r\npolicy rather than of a corrupt and vexatious one. I trust she has at\r\nlength opened her eyes to federal falsehood and misinformation, and\r\nlearnt, in the issue of the presidential election, the folly of believing\r\nthem. Such a reconciliation to the government, if real and permanent, will\r\nsecure the tranquillity of our country, and render the management of our\r\naffairs easy and delightful to our successors, for whom I feel as much\r\ninterest as if I were still in their place. Certainly all the troubles and\r\ndifficulties in the government during our time proceeded from England; at\r\nleast all others were trifling in comparison with them.\r\n\r\nSome time before I retired from office, I proposed to Mr. Smith of the\r\nWar Office, to place your son in the list of some nominations for the new\r\narmy. He called on me and stated that Pickering had prepared materials for\r\nan opposition to his appointment, which he was satisfied would be easily\r\nmet with proper information, but without it, might embarrass and endanger\r\nthe appointment. We concluded therefore that it was best to put it off to\r\nthe ensuing session of Congress, and in the meantime give you notice of\r\nit. He promised to write and explain the delay to you, and I stated the\r\nmatter to Mr. Madison, who would attend to the nomination at the proper\r\ntime. Perhaps late events may supersede all further proceeding as to that\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to present my affectionate respects to Mrs. Dearborne. I\r\nhope that her health, as well as your own, may be improved by a return\r\nto native climate; and that you may both enjoy as many years as you\r\ndesire of health and prosperity, is the prayer of yours sincerely and\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The interruption of our commerce with England, produced by\r\nour embargo and non-intercourse law, and the general indignation excited\r\nby her barefaced attempts to make us accessories and tributaries to her\r\nusurpations on the high seas, have generated in this country an universal\r\nspirit for manufacturing for ourselves, and of reducing to a minimum the\r\nnumber of articles for which we are dependent on her. The advantages,\r\ntoo, of lessening the occasions of risking our peace on the ocean, and\r\nof planting the consumer in our own soil by the side of the grower of\r\nproduce, are so palpable, that no temporary suspension of injuries on her\r\npart, or agreements founded on that, will now prevent our continuing in\r\nwhat we have begun. The spirit of manufacture has taken deep root among\r\nus, and its foundations are laid in too great expense to be abandoned. The\r\nbearer of this, Mr. Ronaldson, will be able to inform you of the extent\r\nand perfection of the works produced here by the late state of things; and\r\nto his information, which is greatest as to what is doing in the cities, I\r\ncan add my own as to the country, where the principal articles wanted in\r\nevery family are now fabricated within itself. This mass of _household_\r\nmanufacture, unseen by the public eye, and so much greater than what is\r\nseen, is such at present, that let our intercourse with England be opened\r\nwhen it may, not one half the amount of what we have heretofore taken\r\nfrom her will ever again be demanded. The great call from the country has\r\nhitherto been of coarse goods. These are now made in our families, and\r\nthe advantage is too sensible ever to be relinquished. It is one of those\r\nobvious improvements in our condition which needed only to be once forced\r\non our attention, never again to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAmong the arts which have made great progress among us is that\r\nof printing. Heretofore we imported our books, and with them much\r\npolitical principle from England. We now print a great deal, and shall\r\nsoon supply ourselves with most of the books of considerable demand.\r\nBut the foundation of printing, you know, is the type-foundry, and a\r\nmaterial essential to that is antimony. Unfortunately that mineral is\r\nnot among those as yet found in the United States, and the difficulty\r\nand dearness of getting it from England, will force us to discontinue\r\nour type-founderies, and resort to her again for our books, unless some\r\nnew source of supply can be found. The bearer, Mr. Ronaldson, is of the\r\nconcern of Binney & Ronaldson, type-founders of Philadelphia. He goes\r\nto France for the purpose of opening some new source of supply, where\r\nwe learn that this article is abundant; the enhancement of the price\r\nin England has taught us the fact, that its exportation thither from\r\nFrance must be interrupted, either by the war or express prohibition.\r\nOur relations, however, with France, are too unlike hers with England,\r\nto place us under the same interdiction. Regulations for preventing the\r\ntransportation of the article to England, under the cover of supplies\r\nto America, may be thought requisite. The bearer, I am persuaded, will\r\nreadily give any assurances which may be required for this object, and\r\nthe wants of his own type-foundry here are a sufficient pledge that what\r\nhe gets is _bonâ fide_ to supply them. I do not know that there will be\r\nany obstacle to his bringing from France any quantity of antimony he may\r\nhave occasion for; but lest there should be, I have taken the liberty of\r\nrecommending him to your patronage. I know your enlightened and liberal\r\nviews on subjects of this kind, and the friendly interest you take in\r\nwhatever concerns our welfare. I place Mr. Ronaldson, therefore, in your\r\nhands, and pray you to advise him, and patronize the object which carries\r\nhim to Europe, and is so interesting to him and to our country. His\r\nknowledge of what is passing among us will be a rich source of information\r\nfor you, and especially as to the state and progress of our manufactures.\r\nYour kindness to him will confer an obligation on me, and will be an\r\nadditional title to the high and affectionate esteem and respect of an\r\nancient and sincere friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 12, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your two letters of the 4th and 7th, were received by the last\r\nmail. I now enclose you the rough draught of the letter to the Emperor of\r\nRussia. I think there must be an exact _fac simile_ of it in the office,\r\nfrom which Mr. Short's must have been copied; because, that the one now\r\nenclosed has never been out of my hands, appears by there being no fold\r\nin the paper till now, and it is evidently a polygraphical copy. I send,\r\nfor your perusal, letters of W. Short, and of Warden; because, though\r\nprivate, they contain some things and views perhaps not in the public\r\nletters. Bonaparte's successes have been what we expected, although\r\nWarden appears to have supposed the contrary possible. It is fortunate for\r\nBonaparte, that he has not caught his brother Emperor; that he has left\r\nan ostensible head to the government, who may sell it to him to secure a\r\nmess of pottage for himself. Had the government devolved on the people,\r\nas it did in Spain, they would resist his conquest as those of Spain do.\r\nI expect, within a week or ten days, to visit Bedford. My absence will be\r\nof about a fortnight. I know too well the pressure of business which will\r\nbe on you at Montpelier, to count with certainty on the pleasure of seeing\r\nMrs. Madison and yourself here; yet my wishes do not permit me to omit the\r\nexpression of them. In any event, I shall certainly intrude a flying visit\r\non you during your stay in Orange. With my respectful devoirs to Mrs.\r\nMadison, I salute you with constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SKELTON JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of June 19th, did not come to hand till the 29th,\r\nand I have not been able to take it up till now. I lent to Mr. Burke,\r\nmy collection of newspapers from 1741 to 1760, and the further matter\r\nwhich I suggested I might be able to furnish him after my return to\r\nMonticello, was the collection of MS. laws of Virginia, which I expected\r\nwould furnish some proper and authentic materials for history, not extant\r\nanywhere else. These I lent the last year to Mr. Hening, who is now\r\nin possession of them and is printing them. But though this was within\r\nMr. Burke's period, it is entirely anterior to yours. The collection of\r\nnewspapers which I lent to Mr. Burke, I have never been able to recover,\r\nnor to learn where they are. They were all well bound, and of course have\r\nnot probably been destroyed. If you can aid me in the recovery, you will\r\noblige me. I consider their preservation as a duty, because I believe\r\ncertainly there does not exist another collection of the same period. I\r\nhave examined the sequel of my collection of newspapers, and find that it\r\nhas but one paper of 1778. That is one of Piordie's of the month of May.\r\nBut my not having them is no evidence they were not printed; because I\r\nwas so continually itinerant during the revolution, that I was rarely in\r\na situation to preserve the papers I received. And although there were\r\nprobably occasional suspensions for want of paper, yet I do not believe\r\nthere was a total one at any time. I think, however, you might procure a\r\nfile for that or any other year, in Philadelphia or Boston. These would\r\nfurnish all the material occurrences of Virginia. You ask, what has the\r\nhistorian to do with the latter part of 1776, the whole of 1777 and 1778,\r\nand a part of 1779? This is precisely the period which was occupied in\r\nthe reformation of the laws to the new organization and principles of our\r\ngovernment. The committee was appointed in the latter part of 1776, and\r\nreported in the spring or summer of 1779. At the first and only meeting of\r\nthe whole committee, (of five persons,) the question was discussed whether\r\nwe would attempt to reduce the whole body of the law into a code, the\r\ntext of which should become the law of the land? We decided against that,\r\nbecause every word and phrase in that text would become a new subject\r\nof criticism and litigation, until its sense should have been settled\r\nby numerous decisions, and that, in the meantime, the rights of property\r\nwould be in the air. We concluded not to meddle with the common law, _i.\r\ne._, the law preceding the existence of the statutes, further than to\r\naccommodate it to our new principles and circumstances; but to take up\r\nthe whole body of statutes and Virginia laws, to leave out everything\r\nobsolete or improper, insert what was wanting, and reduce the whole\r\nwithin as moderate a compass as it would bear, and to the plain language\r\nof common sense, divested of the verbiage, the barbarous tautologies and\r\nredundancies which render the British statutes unintelligible. From this,\r\nhowever, were excepted the ancient statutes, particularly those commented\r\non by Lord Coke, the language of which is simple, and the meaning of every\r\nword so well settled by decisions, as so make it safest not to change\r\nwords where the sense was to be retained. After setting our plan, Col.\r\nMason declined undertaking the execution of any part of it, as not being\r\nsufficiently read in the law. Mr. Lee very soon afterwards died, and the\r\nwork was distributed between Mr. Wythe, Mr. Pendleton and myself. To me\r\nwas assigned the common law, (so far as we thought of altering it,) and\r\nthe statutes down to the Reformation, or end of the reign of Elizabeth; to\r\nMr. Wythe, the subsequent body of the statutes, and to Mr. Pendleton the\r\nVirginia laws. This distribution threw into my part the laws concerning\r\ncrimes and punishments, the law of descents, and the laws concerning\r\nreligion. After completing our work separately, we met, (Mr. W., Mr.\r\nP. and myself,) in Williamsburg, and held a long session, in which we\r\nwent over the first and second parts in the order of time, weighing and\r\ncorrecting every word, and reducing them to the form in which they were\r\nafterwards reported. When we proceeded to the third part, we found that\r\nMr. Pendleton had not exactly seized the intentions of the committee,\r\nwhich were to reform the language of the Virginia laws, and reduce the\r\nmatter to a simple style and form. He had copied the acts _verbatim_,\r\nonly omitting what was disapproved; and some family occurrence calling\r\nhim indispensably home, he desired Mr. Wythe and myself to make it what\r\nwe thought it ought to be, and authorized us to report him as concurring\r\nin the work. We accordingly divided the work, and re-executed it entirely,\r\nso as to assimilate its plan and execution to the other parts, as well as\r\nthe shortness of the time would admit, and we brought the whole body of\r\nBritish statutes and laws of Virginia into 127 acts, most of them short.\r\nThis is the history of that work as to its execution. Its matter and the\r\nnature of the changes made, will be a proper subject for the consideration\r\nof the historian. Experience has convinced me that the change in the style\r\nof the laws was for the better, and it has sensibly reformed the style of\r\nour laws from that time downwards, insomuch that they have obtained, in\r\nthat respect, the approbation of men of consideration on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic. Whether the change in the style and form of the criminal law,\r\nas introduced by Mr. Taylor, was for the better, is not for me to judge.\r\nThe digest of that act employed me longer than I believe all the rest\r\nof the work, for it rendered it necessary for me to go with great care\r\nover Bracton, Britton, the Saxon statutes, and the works of authority on\r\ncriminal law; and it gave me great satisfaction to find that in general\r\nI had only to reduce the law to its ancient Saxon condition, stripping it\r\nof all the innovations and rigorisms of subsequent times, to make it what\r\nit should be. The substitution of the penitentiary, instead of labor on\r\nthe high road and of some other punishments truly objectionable, is a just\r\nmerit to be ascribed to Mr. Taylor's law. When our report was made, the\r\nidea of a penitentiary had never been suggested, the happy experiment of\r\nPennsylvania we had not then the benefit of.\r\n\r\nTo assist in filling up those years of exemption from military invasion,\r\nan inquiry into the exertions of Virginia in the common cause during\r\nthat period, would be proper for the patriotic historian, because her\r\ncharacter has been very unjustly impeached by the writers of other States,\r\nas having used no equal exertions at that time. I know it to be false;\r\nbecause having all that time been a member of the legislature, I know that\r\nour whole occupation was in straining the resources of the State to the\r\nutmost, to furnish men, money, provisions and other necessaries to the\r\ncommon cause. The proofs of this will be found in the journals and acts of\r\nthe legislature, in executive proceedings and papers, and in the auditor's\r\naccounts. Not that Virginia furnished her quota of _requisitions_ of\r\neither men or money; but that she was always above par, in what was\r\n_actually_ furnished by the other States. A letter of mine written in 1779\r\nor '80, if still among the executive papers, will furnish full evidence\r\nof these facts. It was addressed to our delegates in answer to a formal\r\ncomplaint on the subject, and was founded in unquestionable vouchers.\r\n\r\nThe inquiries in your printed letter of August, 1808, would lead to the\r\nwriting the history of my whole life, than which nothing could be more\r\nrepugnant to my feelings. I have been connected, as many fellow laborers\r\nwere, with the great events which happened to mark the epoch of our lives.\r\nBut these belong to no one in particular, all of us did our parts, and no\r\none can claim the transactions to himself. The most I could do would be to\r\nrevise, correct or supply any statements which should be made respecting\r\npublic transactions in which I had a part, or which may have otherwise\r\ncome within my knowledge.\r\n\r\nI have to apologize for the delay of this answer. The active hours of the\r\nday are all devoted to employments without doors, so that I have rarely\r\nan interval, and more rarely the inclination, to set down to my writing\r\ntable, the divorce from which is among the greatest reliefs in my late\r\nchange of life. Still, I will always answer with pleasure any particular\r\ninquiries you may wish to address to me, sincerely desiring for the public\r\ngood as well as your own personal concern, to contribute to the perfection\r\nof a work from which I hope much to both; and I beg leave to tender you\r\nthe assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DASHKOFF.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of July 5th has been duly received, and, in it, that\r\nof my friend Mr. Short. I congratulate you on your safe arrival in the\r\nAmerican hemisphere, after a voyage which must have been lengthy in time,\r\nas it was in space. I hope you may experience no unfavorable change\r\nin your health on so great a change of climate, and that our fervid\r\nsun may be found as innocent as our cloudless skies must be agreeable.\r\nI hail you with particular pleasure, as the first harbinger of those\r\nfriendly relations with your country, so desirable to ours. Both nations\r\nbeing in character and practice essentially pacific, a common interest\r\nin the rights of peaceable nations, gives us a common cause in their\r\nmaintenance; and however your excellent Emperor may have been led from\r\nthe ordinary policy of his government, I trust that the establishment of\r\njust principles will be the result, as I am sure it is the object, of his\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nWhen you shall have had time to accommodate yourself somewhat to our\r\nclimate, our manners and mode of living, you will probably have a\r\ncuriosity to see something of the country you have visited, something\r\nbeyond the confines of our cities. These exhibit specimens of London only,\r\nour country is a different nation. Should your journeyings lead you into\r\nthis quarter of it, I shall be happy to receive you at Monticello, and to\r\nrenew to you in person the assurances I now tender of my great respect and\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 17, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI never doubted the chicanery of the Anglomen on whatsoever measures\r\nyou should take in consequence of the disavowal of Erskine; yet I am\r\nsatisfied that both the proclamations have been sound. The first has been\r\nsanctioned by universal approbation; and although it was not literally\r\nthe case foreseen by the legislature, yet it was a proper extension of\r\ntheir provision to a case similar, though not the same. It proved to\r\nthe whole world our desire of accommodation, and must have satisfied\r\nevery candid federalist on that head. It was not only proper on the\r\nwell-grounded confidence that the arrangement would be honestly executed,\r\nbut ought to have taken place even had the perfidy of England been\r\nforeseen. Their dirty gain is richly remunerated to us by our placing\r\nthem so shamefully in the wrong, and by the union it must produce among\r\nourselves. The last proclamation admits of quibbles, of which advantage\r\nwill doubtless be endeavored to be taken, by those for whom gain is their\r\ngod, and their country nothing. But it is soundly defensible. The British\r\nminister assured us, that the orders of council would be revoked before\r\nthe 10th of June. The executive, trusting in that assurance, declared\r\nby proclamation that the revocation was to take place, and that on that\r\nevent the law was to be suspended. But the event did not take place, and\r\nthe consequence, of course, could not follow. This view is derived from\r\nthe former non-intercourse law only, having never read the latter one.\r\nI had doubted whether Congress must not be called; but that arose from\r\nanother doubt, whether their second law had not changed the ground, so\r\nas to require their agency to give operation to the law. Should Bonaparte\r\nhave the wisdom to correct his injustice towards us, I consider war with\r\nEngland as inevitable. Our ships will go to France and its dependencies,\r\nand they will take them. This will be war on their part, and leave no\r\nalternative but reprisal. I have no doubt you will think it safe to act\r\non this hypothesis, and with energy. The moment that open war shall be\r\napprehended from them, we should take possession of Baton Rouge. If we\r\ndo not, they will, and New Orleans becomes irrecoverable, and the western\r\ncountry blockaded during the war. It would be justifiable towards Spain on\r\nthis ground, and equally so on that of title to West Florida, and reprisal\r\nextended to East Florida. Whatever turn our present difficulty may take,\r\nI look upon all cordial conciliation with England as desperate during the\r\nlife of the present king. I hope and doubt not that Erskine will justify\r\nhimself. My confidence is founded in a belief of his integrity, and in\r\nthe * * * * * of Canning. I consider the present as the most shameless\r\nministry which ever disgraced England. Copenhagen will immortalize their\r\ninfamy. In general, their administrations are so changeable, and they\r\nare obliged to descend to such tricks to keep themselves in place, that\r\nnothing like honor or morality can ever be counted on in transactions with\r\nthem. I salute you with all possible affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN W. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of July 29th came to hand some time since, but I have\r\nnot sooner been able to acknowledge it. In answer to your proposition for\r\npublishing a complete edition of my different writings, I must observe\r\nthat no writings of mine, other than those merely official, have been\r\npublished, except the Notes on Virginia and a small pamphlet under the\r\ntitle of a Summary View of the rights of British America. The Notes on\r\nVirginia, I have always intended to revise and enlarge, and have, from\r\ntime to time, laid by materials for that purpose. It will be long yet\r\nbefore other occupations will permit me to digest them, and observations\r\nand inquiries are still to be made, which will be more correct in\r\nproportion to the length of time they are continued. It is not unlikely\r\nthat this may be through my life. I could not, therefore, at present,\r\noffer anything new for that work.\r\n\r\nThe Summary View was not written for publication. It was a draught I\r\nhad prepared for a petition to the king, which I meant to propose in my\r\nplace as a member of the convention of 1774. Being stopped on the road by\r\nsickness, I sent it on to the Speaker, who laid it on the table for the\r\nperusal of the members. It was thought too strong for the times, and to\r\nbecome the act of the convention, but was printed by subscription of the\r\nmembers, with a short preface written by one of them. If it had any merit,\r\nit was that of first taking our true ground, and that which was afterwards\r\nassumed and maintained.\r\n\r\nI do not mention the Parliamentary Manual, published for the use of the\r\nSenate of the United States, because it was a mere compilation, into which\r\nnothing entered of my own but the arrangement, and a few observations\r\nnecessary to explain that and some of the cases.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether your view extends to official papers of mine\r\nwhich have been published. Many of these would be like old newspapers,\r\nmaterials for future historians, but no longer interesting to the readers\r\nof the day. They would consist of reports, correspondences, messages,\r\nanswers to addresses; a few of my reports while Secretary of State,\r\nmight perhaps be read by some as essays on abstract subjects. Such as the\r\nreport on measures, weights and coins, on the mint, on the fisheries, on\r\ncommerce, on the use of distilled sea-water, &c. The correspondences with\r\nthe British and French ministers, Hammond and Genet, were published by\r\nCongress. The messages to Congress, which might have been interesting at\r\nthe moment, would scarcely be read a second time, and answers to addresses\r\nare hardly read a first time.\r\n\r\nSo that on a review of these various materials, I see nothing encouraging\r\na printer to a re-publication of them. They would probably be bought by\r\nthose only who are in the habit of preserving State papers, and who are\r\nnot many.\r\n\r\nI say nothing of numerous draughts of reports, resolutions, declarations,\r\n&c., drawn as a Member of Congress or of the Legislature of Virginia, such\r\nas the Declaration of Independence, Report on the Money Mint of the United\r\nStates, the act of religious freedom, &c., &c.; these having become the\r\nacts of public bodies, there can be no personal claim to them, and they\r\nwould no more find readers now, than the journals and statute books in\r\nwhich they are deposited.\r\n\r\nI have presented this general view of the subjects which might have been\r\nwithin the scope of your contemplation, that they might be correctly\r\nestimated before any final decision. They belong mostly to a class\r\nof papers not calculated for popular reading, and not likely to offer\r\nprofit, or even indemnification to the re-publisher. Submitting it to your\r\nconsideration, I tender you my salutations and respects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEN. WM. CLARKE.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 10, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--Your favor of June 2d came duly to hand in July, and\r\nbrought me a repetition of the proofs of your kindness to me. Mr. Fitzhugh\r\ndelivered the skin of the sheep of the Rocky Mountains to the President,\r\nfrom whom I expect to receive it in a few days at his own house. For\r\nthis, as well as the blanket of Indian manufacture of the same material,\r\nwhich you are so kind as to offer me, accept my friendly thanks. Your\r\ndonations, and Governor Lewis', have given to my collection of Indian\r\ncuriosities an importance much beyond what I had ever counted on. The\r\nthree boxes of bones which you had been so kind as to send to New Orleans\r\nfor me, as mentioned in your letter of June 2d arrived there safely, and\r\nwere carefully shipped by the collector, and the bill of lading sent to\r\nme. But the vessel put into the Havana, under embargo distress, was there\r\ncondemned as unseaworthy, and her enrollment surrendered at St. Mary's.\r\nWhat was done with my three boxes I have not learned, but have written\r\nto Mr. Brown, the collector, to have inquiry made after them. The bones\r\nof this animal are now in such a state of evanescence as to render it\r\nimportant to save what we can of them. Of those you had formerly sent me,\r\nI reserved a very few for myself; I got Dr. Wistar to select from the rest\r\nevery piece which could be interesting to the Philosophical Society, and\r\nsent the residue to the National Institute of France. These have enabled\r\nthem to decide that the animal was neither a mammoth nor an elephant, but\r\nof a distinct kind, to which they have given the name of Mastodont, from\r\nthe protuberance of its teeth. These, from their forms, and the immense\r\nmass of their jaws, satisfy me this animal must have been arbonverous.\r\nNature seems not to have provided other food sufficient for him, and the\r\nlimb of a tree would be no more to him than a bough of a cotton tree to\r\na horse. You mention in your letter that you are proceeding with _your\r\nfamily_ to Fort Massac. This informs me that you have a family, and I\r\nsincerely congratulate you on it, while some may think it will render you\r\nless active in the service of the world, those who take a sincere interest\r\nin your personal happiness, and who know that, by a law of our nature,\r\nwe cannot be happy without the endearing connections of a family, will\r\nrejoice for your sake as I do. The world has, of right, no further claims\r\non yourself and General Lewis, but such as you may voluntarily render\r\naccording to your convenience, or as they may make it your interest. I\r\nwrote lately to the Governor, but be so good as to repeat my affectionate\r\nattachments to him, and to be assured of the same to yourself, with every\r\nsentiment of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 12, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,-- * * * * *\r\n\r\nCanning's equivocations degrade his government as well as himself. I\r\ndespair of accommodation with them, because I believe they are weak enough\r\nto intend seriously to claim the ocean as their conquest, and think to\r\namuse us with embassies and negotiations, until the claim shall have been\r\nstrengthened by time and exercise, and the moment arrive when they may\r\nboldly avow what hitherto they have only squinted at. Always yours, with\r\nsincere affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BARTON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 21, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received last night your favor of the 14th, and would with\r\nall possible pleasure have communicated to you any part or the whole\r\nof the Indian vocabularies which I had collected, but an irreparable\r\nmisfortune has deprived me of them. I have now been thirty years availing\r\nmyself of every possible opportunity of procuring Indian vocabularies to\r\nthe same set of words; my opportunities were probably better than will\r\never occur again to any person having the same desire. I had collected\r\nabout fifty, and had digested most of them in collateral columns, and\r\nmeant to have printed them the last of my stay in Washington. But not\r\nhaving yet digested Captain Lewis' collection, nor having leisure then to\r\ndo it, I put it off till I should return home. The whole, as well digest\r\nas originals, were packed in a trunk of stationery, and sent round by\r\nwater with about thirty other packages of my effects from Washington, and\r\nwhile ascending James river, this package on account of its weight and\r\npresumed precious contents, was singled out and stolen. The thief being\r\ndisappointed on opening it, threw into the river all its contents, of\r\nwhich he thought he could make no use. Among them were the whole of the\r\nvocabularies. Some leaves floated ashore and were found in the mud; but\r\nthese were very few, and so defaced by the mud and water that no general\r\nuse can be made of them. On the receipt of your letter I turned to them,\r\nand was very happy to find, that the only morsel of an original vocabulary\r\namong them, was Captain Lewis' of the Pani language, of which you say\r\nyou have not one word. I therefore enclose it to you as it is, and a\r\nlittle fragment of some other, which I see is in his hand writing, but no\r\nindication remains on it of what language it is. It is a specimen of the\r\ncondition of the little which was recovered. I am the more concerned at\r\nthis accident, as of the two hundred and fifty words of my vocabularies,\r\nand the one hundred and thirty words of the great Russian vocabularies\r\nof the languages of the other quarters of the globe, seventy-three were\r\ncommon to both, and would have furnished materials for a comparison from\r\nwhich something might have resulted. Although I believe no general use\r\ncan ever be made of the wrecks of my loss, yet I will ask the return of\r\nthe Pani vocabulary when you are done with it. Perhaps I may make another\r\nattempt to collect, although I am too old to expect to make much progress\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nI learn with pleasure your acquisition of the pamphlet on the astronomy\r\nof the ancient Mexicans. If it be ancient and genuine, or modern and\r\nrational, it will be of real value. It is one of the most interesting\r\ncountries of our hemisphere, and merits every attention.\r\n\r\nI am thankful for your kind offer of sending the original Spanish for my\r\nperusal. But I think it a pity to trust it to the accidents of the post,\r\nand whenever you publish the translation, I shall be satisfied to read\r\nthat which shall be given by your translator, who is, I am sure, a greater\r\nadept in the language than I am.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES FISHBACK.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 27, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of June 5th came to hand in due time, and I have to\r\nacknowledge my gratification at the friendly sentiments it breathes\r\ntowards myself. We have been thrown into times of a peculiar character,\r\nand to work our way through them has required services and sacrifices\r\nfrom our countrymen generally, and to their great honor, these have\r\nbeen generally exhibited, by every one in his sphere, and according\r\nto the opportunities afforded. With them I have been a fellow laborer,\r\nendeavoring to do faithfully the part alloted to me, as they did theirs;\r\nand it is a subject of mutual congratulation that, in a state of things\r\nsuch as the world had never before seen, we have gotten on so far well;\r\nand my confidence in our present high functionaries, as well as in my\r\ncountrymen generally, leaves me without much fear for the future.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the pamphlet you was so kind as to send me. At an earlier\r\nperiod of life I pursued inquiries of that kind with industry and care.\r\nReading, reflection and time have convinced me that the interests of\r\nsociety require the observation of those moral precepts only in which all\r\nreligions agree, (for all forbid us to murder, steal, plunder, or bear\r\nfalse witness,) and that we should not intermeddle with the particular\r\ndogmas in which all religions differ, and which are totally unconnected\r\nwith morality. In all of them we see good men, and as many in one as\r\nanother. The varieties in the structure and action of the human mind as in\r\nthose of the body, are the work of our Creator, against which it cannot\r\nbe a religious duty to erect the standard of uniformity. The practice of\r\nmorality being necessary for the well-being of society, he has taken care\r\nto impress its precepts so indelibly on our hearts that they shall not be\r\neffaced by the subtleties of our brain. We all agree in the obligation of\r\nthe moral precepts of Jesus, and nowhere will they be found delivered in\r\ngreater purity than in his discourses. It is, then, a matter of principle\r\nwith me to avoid disturbing the tranquillity of others by the expression\r\nof any opinion on the innocent questions on which we schismatize. On the\r\nsubject of your pamphlet, and the mode of treating it, I permit myself\r\nonly to observe the candor, moderation and ingenuity with which you appear\r\nto have sought truth. This is of good example, and worthy of commendation.\r\nIf all the writers and preachers on religious questions had been of\r\nthe same temper, the history of the world would have been of much more\r\npleasing aspect.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the kindness towards myself which breathes through your\r\nletter. The first of all our consolations is that of having faithfully\r\nfulfilled our duties; the next, the approbation and good will of those\r\nwho have witnessed it; and I pray you to accept my best wishes for your\r\nhappiness and the assurances of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. BLOODGOOD AND HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 30, 1809.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--The very friendly sentiments which my republican fellow\r\ncitizens of the city and county of New York have been pleased to express\r\nthrough yourselves as their organ, are highly grateful to me, and command\r\nmy sincere thanks; and their approbation of the measures pursued, while\r\nI was entrusted with the administration of their affairs, strengthens my\r\nhope that they were favorable to the public prosperity. For any errors\r\nwhich may have been committed, the indulgent will find some apology in\r\nthe difficulties resulting from the extraordinary state of human affairs,\r\nand the astonishing spectacles these have presented. A world in arms and\r\ntrampling on all those moral principles which have heretofore been deemed\r\nsacred in the intercourse between nations, could not suffer us to remain\r\ninsensible of all agitation. During such a course of lawless violence,\r\nit was certainly wise to withdraw ourselves from all intercourse with\r\nthe belligerent nations, to avoid the desolating calamities inseparable\r\nfrom war, its pernicious effects on manners and morals, and the dangers\r\nit threatens to free governments; and to cultivate our own resources\r\nuntil our natural and progressive growth should leave us nothing to fear\r\nfrom foreign enterprise. That the benefits derived from these measures\r\nwere lessened by an opposition of the most ominous character, and that\r\na continuance of injury was encouraged by the appearance of domestic\r\nweakness which that presented, will doubtless be a subject of deep and\r\ndurable regret to such of our well-intentioned citizens as participated\r\nin it, under mistaken confidence in men who had other views than the good\r\nof their own country. Should foreign nations, however, deceived by this\r\nappearance of division and weakness, render it necessary to vindicate by\r\narms the injuries to our country, I believe, with you, that the spirit\r\nof the revolution is unextinguished, and that the cultivators of peace\r\nwill again, as on that occasion, be transformed at once into a nation of\r\nwarriors, who will leave us nothing to fear for the natural and national\r\nrights of our country.\r\n\r\nYour approbation of the reasons which induced me to retire from the\r\nhonorable station in which my fellow citizens had placed me, is a proof\r\nof your devotion to the true principles of our constitution. These are\r\nwisely opposed to all perpetuations of power, and to every practice which\r\nmay lead to hereditary establishments; and certain I am that any services\r\nwhich I could have rendered will be more than supplied by the wisdom and\r\nvirtues of my successor.\r\n\r\nI am very thankful for the kind wishes you express for my personal\r\nhappiness. It will always be intimately connected with the prosperity of\r\nour country, of which I sincerely pray that my fellow citizens of the city\r\nand county of New York may have their full participation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DON VALENTINE DE FORONDA.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 4, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of August the 26th came to hand in the succeeding\r\nmonth, and I have now to thank you for the pamphlet it contained. I\r\nhave read it with pleasure, and find the constitution proposed would\r\nprobably be as free as is consistent with hereditary institutions. It has\r\none feature which I like much; that which provides that when the three\r\nco-ordinate branches differ in their construction of the constitution, the\r\nopinion of two branches shall overrule the third. Our constitution has not\r\nsufficiently solved this difficulty.\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of characters with which public office leads us to\r\nofficial intercourse, we cannot fail to observe many, whose personal\r\nworth marks them as objects of particular esteem, whom we would wish\r\nto select for our society in private life. I avail myself gladly of the\r\npresent occasion of assuring you that I was peculiarly impressed with your\r\nmerit and talents, and that I have ever entertained for them a particular\r\nrespect. To those whose views are single and direct, it is a great comfort\r\nto have to do business with frank and honorable minds. And here give me\r\nleave to make an avowal, for which, in my present retirement, there can be\r\nno motive but a regard for truth. Your predecessor, soured on a question\r\nof etiquette against the administration of this country, wished to impute\r\nwrong to them in all their actions, even where he did not believe it\r\nhimself. In this spirit, he wished it to be believed that we were in\r\nunjustifiable co-operation in Miranda's expedition. I solemnly, and on my\r\npersonal truth and honor, declare to you, that this was entirely without\r\nfoundation, and that there was neither co-operation, nor connivance on our\r\npart. He informed us he was about to attempt the liberation of his native\r\ncountry from bondage, and intimated a hope of our aid, or connivance\r\nat least. He was at once informed, that although we had great cause of\r\ncomplaint against Spain, and even of war, yet whenever we should think\r\nproper to act as her enemy, it should be openly and above board, and that\r\nour hostility should never be exercised by such petty means. We had no\r\nsuspicion that he expected to engage men here, but merely to purchase\r\nmilitary stores. Against this there was no law, nor consequently any\r\nauthority for us to interpose obstacles. On the other hand, we deemed it\r\nimproper to betray his voluntary communication to the agents of Spain.\r\nAlthough his measures were many days in preparation at New York, we\r\nnever had the least intimation or suspicion of his engaging men in his\r\nenterprise, until he was gone; and I presume the secrecy of his proceeding\r\nkept them equally unknown to the Marquis Yrujo at Philadelphia, and the\r\nSpanish consul at New York, since neither of them gave us any information\r\nof the enlistment of men, until it was too late for any measures taken\r\nat Washington to prevent their departure. The officer in the Customs, who\r\nparticipated in this transaction with Miranda, we immediately removed, and\r\nshould have had him and others further punished, had it not been for the\r\nprotection given them by private citizens at New York, in opposition to\r\nthe government, who, by their impudent falsehoods and calumnies, were able\r\nto overbear the minds of the jurors. Be assured, Sir, that no motive could\r\ninduce me, at this time, to make this declaration so gratuitously, were it\r\nnot founded in sacred truth; and I will add further, that I never did, or\r\ncountenanced, in public life, a single act inconsistent with the strictest\r\ngood faith; having never believed there was one code of morality for a\r\npublic, and another for a private man.\r\n\r\nI receive, with great pleasure, the testimonies of personal esteem which\r\nbreathes through your letter; and I pray you to accept those equally\r\nsincere with which I now salute you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 8, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is long since I ought to have acknowledged the receipt of\r\nyour most excellent oration on the 4th of July. I was doubting what you\r\ncould say, equal to your own reputation, on so hackneyed a subject; but\r\nyou have really risen out of it with lustre, and pointed to others a field\r\nof great expansion. A day or two after I received your letter to Bishop\r\nGregoire, a copy of his diatribe to you came to hand from France. I had\r\nnot before heard of it. He must have been eagle-eyed in quest of offence,\r\nto have discovered ground for it among the rubbish massed together in\r\nthe print he animadverts on. You have done right in giving him a sugary\r\nanswer. But he did not deserve it. For, notwithstanding a compliment to\r\nyou now and then, he constantly returns to the identification of your\r\nsentiments with the extravagances of the Revolutionary zealots. I believe\r\nhim a very good man, with imagination enough to declaim eloquently,\r\nbut without judgment to decide. He wrote to me also on the doubts I had\r\nexpressed five or six and twenty years ago, in the Notes of Virginia, as\r\nto the grade of understanding of the negroes, and he sent me his book on\r\nthe literature of the negroes. His credulity has made him gather up every\r\nstory he could find of men of color, (without distinguishing whether\r\nblack, or of what degree of mixture,) however slight the mention, or\r\nlight the authority on which they are quoted. The whole do no amount,\r\nin point of evidence, to what we know ourselves of Banneker. We know he\r\nhad spherical trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the\r\nsuspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor and friend, and never\r\nmissed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long letter from Banneker,\r\nwhich shows him to have had a mind of very common stature indeed. As to\r\nBishop Gregoire, I wrote him, as you have done, a very soft answer. It was\r\nimpossible for doubt to have been more tenderly or hesitatingly expressed\r\nthan that was in the Notes of Virginia, and nothing was or is farther from\r\nmy intentions, than to enlist myself as the champion of a fixed opinion,\r\nwhere I have only expressed a doubt. St. Domingo will, in time, throw\r\nlight on the question.\r\n\r\nI intended, ere this, to have sent you the papers I had promised you. But\r\nI have taken up Marshall's fifth volume, and mean to read it carefully,\r\nto correct what is wrong in it, and commit to writing such facts and\r\nannotations as the reading of that work will bring into my recollection,\r\nand which has not yet been put on paper; in this I shall be much aided\r\nby my memorandums and letters, and will send you both the old and the\r\nnew. But I go on very slowly. In truth, during the pleasant season, I am\r\nalways out of doors, employed, not passing more time at my writing table\r\nthan will despatch my current business. But when the weather becomes\r\ncold, I shall go out but little. I hope, therefore, to get through this\r\nvolume during the ensuing winter; but should you want the papers sooner,\r\nthey shall be sent at a moment's warning. The ride from Washington to\r\nMonticello in the stage, or in a gig, is so easy that I had hoped you\r\nwould have taken a flight here during the season of good roads. Whenever\r\nMrs. Barlow is well enough to join you in such a visit, it must be\r\ntaken more at ease. It will give us real pleasure whenever it may take\r\nplace. I pray you to present me to her respectfully, and I salute you\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 11, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I do not know whether the request of Monsieur Moussier,\r\nexplained in the enclosed letter, is grantable or not. But my partialities\r\nin favor of whatever may promote either the useful or liberal arts, induce\r\nme to place it under your consideration, to do in it whatever is right,\r\nneither more nor less. I would then ask you to favor me with three lines,\r\nin such form as I may forward him by way of answer.\r\n\r\nI have reflected much and painfully on the change of dispositions\r\nwhich has taken place among the members of the cabinet, since the new\r\narrangement, as you stated to me in the moment of our separation. It\r\nwould be, indeed, a great public calamity were it to fix you in the\r\npurpose which you seemed to think possible. I consider the fortunes of\r\nour republic as depending, in an eminent degree, on the extinguishment\r\nof the public debt before we engage in any war: because, that done, we\r\nshall have revenue enough to improve our country in peace and defend it\r\nin war, without recurring either to new taxes or loans. But if the debt\r\nshould once more be swelled to a formidable size, its entire discharge\r\nwill be despaired of, and we shall be committed to the English career of\r\ndebt, corruption and rottenness, closing with revolution. The discharge\r\nof the debt, therefore, is vital to the destinies of our government,\r\nand it hangs on Mr. Madison and yourself alone. We shall never see\r\nanother President and Secretary of the Treasury making all other objects\r\nsubordinate to this. Were either of you to be lost to the public, that\r\ngreat hope is lost. I had always cherished the idea that you would fix\r\non that object the measure of your fame, and of the gratitude which our\r\ncountry will owe you. Nor can I yield up this prospect to the secondary\r\nconsiderations which assail your tranquillity. For sure I am, they never\r\ncan produce any other serious effect. Your value is too justly estimated\r\nby our fellow citizens at large, as well as their functionaries, to\r\nadmit any remissness in their support of you. My opinion always was,\r\nthat none of us ever occupied stronger ground in the esteem of Congress\r\nthan yourself, and I am satisfied there is no one who does not feel\r\nyour aid to be still as important for the future as it has been for the\r\npast. You have nothing, therefore, to apprehend in the dispositions of\r\nCongress, and still less of the President, who, above all men, is the\r\nmost interested and affectionately disposed to support you. I hope, then,\r\nyou will abandon entirely the idea you expressed to me, and that you will\r\nconsider the eight years to come as essential to your political career.\r\nI should certainly consider any earlier day of your retirement, as the\r\nmost inauspicious day our new government has ever seen. In addition to\r\nthe common interest in this question, I feel particularly for myself the\r\nconsiderations of gratitude which I personally owe you for your valuable\r\naid during my administration of public affairs, a just sense of the large\r\nportion of the public approbation which was earned by your labors and\r\nbelongs to you, and the sincere friendship and attachment which grew out\r\nof our joint exertions to promote the common good; and of which I pray you\r\nnow to accept the most cordial and respectful assurances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CHEVALIER DE ONIS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, November 4, 1809.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his respectful compliments to his Excellency the\r\nChevalier de Onis, and congratulates him on his safe arrival in the United\r\nStates, and at a season so propitious for the preservation of health\r\nagainst the effects of a sensible and sudden change of climate. He hopes\r\nthat his residence here will be made agreeable to him, and that it will be\r\nuseful in cementing the friendship and intercourse of the two nations, so\r\nadvantageous to both. He would have been happy to have paid his respects\r\nto the Chevalier de Onis in person, and to have had the honor of forming\r\nhis acquaintance; but the distance and bad roads deny him that pleasure.\r\nHe learns with great satisfaction that his venerable and worthy friend,\r\nMr. Yznardi, continues in life and health, and takes this occasion of\r\nbearing testimony to his loyal and honorable conduct while in the United\r\nStates. He salutes the Chevalier de Onis with assurances of his high\r\nrespect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. IRVING, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 23, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--An American vessel, the property of a respectable merchant of\r\nGeorgetown, on a voyage to some part of Europe for general purposes\r\nof commerce, proposes to touch at some part of Spain with the view of\r\nobtaining Merino sheep to be brought to our country. The necessity we are\r\nunder, and the determination we have formed of emancipating ourselves\r\nfrom a dependence on foreign countries for manufactures which may be\r\nadvantageously established among ourselves, has produced a very general\r\ndesire to improve the quality of our wool by the introduction of the\r\nMerino race of sheep. Your sense of the duties you owe to your station\r\nwill not permit me to ask, nor yourself to do any act which might\r\ncompromit you with the government with which you reside, or forfeit\r\nthat confidence on their part which can alone enable you to be useful\r\nto your country. But as far as that will permit you to give aid to the\r\nprocuring and bringing away some of the valuable race, I take the liberty\r\nof soliciting you to do so--it will be an important service rendered to\r\nyour country: to which you will be further encouraged by the assurance\r\nthat the enterprise is solely on the behalf of agricultural gentlemen of\r\ndistinguished character in Washington and its neighborhood, with a view\r\nof disseminating the benefits of their success as widely as they can.\r\nWithout any interest in it myself, other than the general one, I cannot\r\nhelp wishing a favorable result, and therefore add my solicitations to the\r\nassurances of my constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 26, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 6th was received from our post office on\r\nthe 24th, after my return from Bedford. I now re-enclose the letters of\r\nMr. Short and Romanzoff, and with them a letter from Armstrong, for your\r\nperusal, as there may be some matters in it not otherwise communicated.\r\nThe infatuation of the British government and nation is beyond every\r\nthing imaginable. A thousand circumstances announce that they are\r\non the point of being blown up, and they still proceed with the same\r\nmadness and increased wickedness. With respect to Jackson I hear but one\r\nsentiment, except that some think he should have been sent off. The more\r\nmoderate step was certainly more advisable. There seems to be a perfect\r\nacquiescence in the opinion of the Government respecting Onis. The public\r\ninterest certainly made his rejection expedient, and as that is a motive\r\nwhich it is not pleasant always to avow, I think it fortunate that the\r\ncontending claims of Charles and Ferdinand furnished such plausible\r\nembarrassment to the question of right; for, on our principles, I presume,\r\nthe right of the Junta to send a Minister could not be denied. La Fayette,\r\nin a letter to me expresses great anxiety to receive his formal titles to\r\nthe lands in Louisiana. Indeed, I know not why the proper officers have\r\nnot sooner sent on the papers on which the grants might issue. It will\r\nbe in your power to forward the grants or copies of them by some safe\r\nconveyance, as La Fayette says that no negotiation can be effected without\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter from Major Neely, Chickasaw agent, stating that\r\nhe is in possession of two trunks of the unfortunate Governor Lewis,\r\ncontaining public vouchers, the manuscripts of his western journey, and\r\nprobably some private papers. As he desired they should be sent _to the\r\nPresident_, as the public vouchers render it interesting to the public\r\nthat they should be safely received, and they would probably come most\r\nsafely if addressed to you, would it not be advisable that Major Neely\r\nshould receive an order on your part to forward them to Washington\r\naddressed to you, by the Stage, and if possible under the care of some\r\nperson coming on? When at Washington I presume the papers may be opened\r\nand distributed; that is to say, the vouchers to the proper offices where\r\nthey are cognizable; the manuscript voyage, &c., to General Clarke, who\r\nis interested in it, and is believed to be now on his way to Washington;\r\nand his private papers, if any, to his administrator--who is John Marks,\r\nhis half brother. It is impossible you should have time to examine and\r\ndistribute them; but if Mr. Coles could find time to do it, the family\r\nwould have entire confidence in his distribution. The other two trunks,\r\nwhich are in the care of Capt. Russel at the Chickasaw bluffs, and which\r\nPernier (Gov. Lewis' servant) says contain his private property, I write\r\nto Capt. Russel, at the request of Mr. Marks, to forward to Mr. Brown\r\nat New Orleans, to be sent on to Richmond under my address. Pernier says\r\nthat Gov. Lewis owes him $240 for his wages. He has received money from\r\nNeely to bring him on here, and I furnish him to Washington, where he\r\nwill arrive penniless, and will ask for some money to be placed to the\r\nGovernor's account. He rides a horse of the Governor's, which, with the\r\napprobation of the administration, I tell him to dispose of and give\r\ncredit for the amount in his account against the Governor. He is the\r\nbearer of this letter, and of my assurances of constant and affectionate\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 30, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received last night yours of the 27th, and rode this morning\r\nto Col. Monroe's. I found him preparing to set out to-morrow morning for\r\nLondon, from whence he will not return till Christmas. I had an hour or\r\ntwo's frank conversation with him. The catastrophe of poor Lewis served\r\nto lead us to the point intended. I reminded him that in the letter I\r\nwrote to him while in Europe, proposing the Government of Orleans, I also\r\nsuggested that of Louisiana, if fears for health should be opposed to the\r\nother. I said something on the importance of the post, its advantages,\r\n&c.--expressed my regret at the curtain which seemed to be drawn between\r\nhim and his best friends, and my wish to see his talents and integrity\r\nengaged in the service of his country again, and that his going into\r\nany post would be a signal of reconciliation, on which the body of\r\nrepublicans, who lamented his absence from the public service, would again\r\nrally to him. These are the general heads of what I said to him in the\r\ncourse of our conversation. The sum of his answers was, that to accept\r\nof that office was incompatible with the respect he owed himself; that\r\nhe never would act in any office where he should be subordinate to any\r\nbody but the President himself, or which did not place his responsibility\r\nsubstantially with the President and the nation; that at your accession\r\nto the chair, he would have accepted a place in the cabinet, and would\r\nhave exerted his endeavors most faithfully in support of your fame and\r\nmeasures; that he is not unready to serve the public, and especially in\r\nthe case of any difficult crisis in our affairs; that he is satisfied that\r\nsuch is the deadly hatred of both France and England, and such their self\r\nreproach and dread at the spectacle of such a government as ours, that\r\nthey will spare nothing to destroy it; that nothing but a firm union among\r\nthe whole body of republicans can save it, and therefore that no schism\r\nshould be indulged on any ground; that in his present situation, he is\r\nsincere in his anxieties for the success of the administration, and in\r\nhis support of it as far as the limited sphere of his action or influence\r\nextends; that his influence to this end had been used with those with\r\nwhom the world had ascribed to him an interest he did not possess, until,\r\nwhatever it was, it was lost, (he particularly named J. Randolph, who, he\r\nsaid, had plans of his own, on which he took no advice;) and that he was\r\nnow pursuing what he believed his properest occupation, devoting his whole\r\ntime and faculties to the liberation of his pecuniary embarrassments,\r\nwhich, three years of close attention, he hoped, would effect. In order\r\nto know more exactly what were the kinds of employ he would accept, I\r\nadverted to the information of the papers, which came yesterday, that\r\nGen. Hampton was dead, but observed that the military life in our present\r\nstate, offered nothing which could operate on the principle of patriotism;\r\nhe said he would sooner be shot than take a command under Wilkinson.\r\nIn this sketch, I have given truly the substance of his ideas, but not\r\nalways his own words. On the whole, I conclude he would accept a place in\r\nthe cabinet, or a military command dependent on the Executive alone, and\r\nI rather suppose a diplomatic mission, because it would fall within the\r\nscope of his views, and not because he said so, for no allusion was made\r\nto anything of that kind in our conversation. Everything from him breathed\r\nthe purest patriotism, involving, however, a close attention to his own\r\nhonor and grade. He expressed himself with the utmost devotion to the\r\ninterests of our own country, and I am satisfied he will pursue them with\r\nhonor and zeal in any character in which he shall be willing to act.\r\n\r\nI have thus gone far beyond the single view of your letter, that you may,\r\nunder any circumstances, form a just estimate of what he would be disposed\r\nto do. God bless you, and carry you safely through all your difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CHARLES F. WELLES.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, December 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received, within a few days past, your favor of February 29th,\r\n(for September, I presume,) in either case it has been long on the way.\r\nIt covered the two pieces of poetry it referred to. Of all the charges\r\nbrought against me by my political adversaries, that of possessing\r\nsome science has probably done them the least credit. Our countrymen\r\nare too enlightened themselves, to believe that ignorance is the best\r\nqualification for their service. If Mr. M. solicits a seat in Congress,\r\nI am sure he will be more just to himself, and more respectful to his\r\nelectors, than to claim it on this ground.\r\n\r\nWithout pretending to all the merits so kindly ascribed by the more\r\nfriendly and poetical answer, I feel the right of claiming that of\r\nintegrity of motives. Whether the principles of the majority of our fellow\r\ncitizens, or of the little minority still opposing them, be most friendly\r\nto the rights of man, posterity will judge; and to that arbiter I submit\r\nmy own conduct with cheerfulness. It has been a great happiness to me, to\r\nhave received the approbation of so great a portion of my fellow citizens,\r\nand particularly of those who have opportunities of inquiring, reading\r\nand deciding for themselves. It is on this view that I owe you especial\r\nacknowledgments, which I pray you to accept with the assurances of my\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, December 7, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed letter is from Father Richard, the Director of\r\na school at Detroit, being on a subject in which the departments both\r\nof the Treasury and War are concerned, I take the liberty of enclosing\r\nit to yourself as the centre which may unite these two agencies. The\r\ntransactions which it alludes to took place in the months of December and\r\nJanuary preceding my retirement from office, and as I think it possible\r\nthey may not have been fully placed on the records of the War office,\r\nbecause they were conducted verbally for the most part, I will give a\r\ngeneral statement of them as well as my recollection will enable me. In\r\nthe neighborhood of Detroit (two or three miles from the town) is a farm,\r\nformerly the property of one Earnest, a bankrupt Collector. It is now in\r\nthe possession of the Treasury department, as a pledge for a sum in which\r\nhe is in default to the government, much beyond the value of the farm.\r\nAs it is a good one, has proper buildings, and in a proper position for\r\nthe purpose contemplated, General Dearborne proposed to purchase it for\r\nthe War department at its real value. Mr. Gallatin thought he should ask\r\nthe sum for which it was hypothecated. I do not remember the last idea\r\nin which we all concurred; but I believe it was that, as the Treasury\r\nmust, in the end, sell it for what it could get, the War department would\r\nbecome a bidder as far as its real value, and in the meantime would rent\r\nit. On this farm we proposed to assemble the following establishments:\r\n1st. Father Richards' school. He teaches the children of the inhabitants\r\nof Detroit--but the part of the school within our view was that of the\r\nyoung Indian girls instructed by two French females, natives of the\r\nplace, who devote their whole time and their own property, which was not\r\ninconsiderable, to the care and instruction of Indian girls in carding,\r\nspinning, weaving, sewing, and the other household arts suited to the\r\ncondition of the poor, and as practiced by the white women of that\r\ncondition. Reading and writing were an incidental part of their education.\r\nWe proposed that the War department should furnish the farm and the houses\r\nfor the use of the school gratis, and add $400 a year to the funds, and\r\nthat the benefits of the Institution should be extended to the boys also\r\nof the neighboring tribes, who were to be lodged, fed, and instructed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n2d. To establish there the farmer at present employed by the United\r\nStates, to instruct those Indians in the use of the plough and other\r\nimplements and practices of agriculture, and in the general management\r\nof the farm. This man was to labor the farm himself, and to have the aid\r\nof the boys through a principal portion of the day, by which they would\r\ncontract habits of industry, learn the business of farming, and provide\r\nsubsistence for the whole Institution. Reading and writing were to be a\r\nsecondary object.\r\n\r\n3d. To remove thither the carpenter and smith at present employed by the\r\nUnited States among the same Indians; with whom such of the boys as had a\r\nturn for it should work and learn their trades.\r\n\r\nThis establishment was recommended by the further circumstance that\r\nwhenever the Indians come to Detroit on trade or other business, they\r\nencamp on or about this farm. This would give them opportunities of seeing\r\ntheir sons and daughters, and their advancement in the useful arts--of\r\nseeing and learning from example all the operations and process of a farm,\r\nand of always carrying home themselves some additional knowledge of these\r\nthings. It was thought more important to extend the civilized arts, and to\r\nintroduce a separation of property among the Indians of the country around\r\nDetroit than elsewhere, because learning to set a high value on their\r\nproperty, and losing by degrees all other dependence for subsistence,\r\nthey would deprecate war with us as bringing certain destruction on their\r\nproperty, and would become a barrier for that distant and isolated post\r\nagainst the Indians beyond them. There are beyond them some strong tribes,\r\nas the Sacs, Foxes, &c., with whom we have as yet had little connection,\r\nand slender opportunities of extending to them our benefits and influence.\r\nThey are therefore ready instruments to be brought into operation on us\r\nby a powerful neighbor, which still cultivates its influence over them by\r\nnourishing the savage habits which waste them, rather than by encouraging\r\nthe civilized arts which would soften, conciliate and preserve them. The\r\nwhole additional expense to the United States was to be the price of the\r\nfarm, and an increase of $400 in the annual expenditures for these tribes.\r\n\r\nThis is the sum of my recollections. I cannot answer for their\r\nexactitude in all details, but General Dearborne could supply and\r\ncorrect the particulars of my statement. Mr. Gallatin, too was so often\r\nin consultation on the subject, that he must have been informed of the\r\nwhole plan; and his memory is so much better than mine, that he will be\r\nable to make my statement what it should be. Add to this that I think I\r\ngenerally informed yourself of our policy and proceedings in the case, as\r\nwe went along; and, if I am not mistaken, it was one of the articles of a\r\nmemorandum I left with you of things still in fieri, and which would merit\r\nyour attention. I have thought it necessary to put you in possession of\r\nthese facts, that you might understand the grounds of Father Richards'\r\napplication, and be enabled to judge for yourself of the expediency of\r\npursuing the plan, or of the means of withdrawing from it with justice\r\nto the individuals employed in its execution. How far we are committed\r\nwith the Indians themselves in this business will be seen in a speech\r\nof mine to them, of January 31st, filed in the War office, and perhaps\r\nsomething more may have passed to them from the Secretary of War. Always\r\naffectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. CHAPMAN.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 11, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of November 10th did not come to hand till the 29th\r\nof that month. The subject you have chosen for the next anniversary\r\ndiscourse of the Linnean Society, is certainly a very interesting and also\r\na difficult one. The change which has taken place in our climate, is one\r\nof those facts which all men of years are sensible of, and yet none can\r\nprove by regular evidence, they can only appeal to each other's general\r\nobservation for the fact. I remember that when I was a small boy, (say 60\r\nyears ago,) snows were frequent and deep in every winter--to my knee very\r\noften, to my waist sometimes--and that they covered the earth long. And I\r\nremember while yet young, to have heard from very old men, that in their\r\nyouth, the winters had been still colder, with deeper and longer snows. In\r\nthe year 1772, (37 years ago,) we had a snow two feet deep in the champain\r\nparts of this State, and three feet in the counties next below the\r\nmountains. That year is still marked in conversation by the designation\r\nof \"the year of the deep snow.\" But I know of no regular diaries of the\r\nweather very far back. In latter times, they might perhaps be found. While\r\nI lived at Washington, I kept a diary, and by recurring to that, I observe\r\nthat from the winter of 1802-3, to that of 1808-9, inclusive, the average\r\nfall of snow of the seven winters was only fourteen and a half inches,\r\nand that the ground was covered but sixteen days in each winter on an\r\naverage of the whole. The maximum in any one winter, during that period,\r\nwas twenty-one inches fall, and thirty-four days on the ground. The change\r\nin our climate is very shortly noticed in the Notes on Virginia, because I\r\nhad few facts to state but from my own recollections, then only of thirty\r\nor thirty-five years. Since that my whole time has been so completely\r\noccupied in public vocations, that I have been able to pay but little\r\nattention to this subject, and if I have heard any facts respecting it,\r\nI made no note of them, and they have escaped my memory. Thus, sir, with\r\nevery disposition to furnish you with any information in my possession, I\r\ncan only express my regrets at the entire want of them. Nor do I know of\r\nany source in this State, now existing, from which anything on the subject\r\ncan be derived. Williams, in his History of Vermont, has an essay on the\r\nchange of climate in Europe, Asia and Africa, and has very ingeniously\r\nlaid history under contribution for materials. Doctor Williamson has\r\nwritten on the change of our climate, in one of the early volumes of our\r\nphilosophical transactions. Both of these are doubtless known to you.\r\n\r\nWishing it had been in my power to have been more useful to you, I pray\r\nyou to accept the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. C. NICHOLAS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 16, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now enclose you the agricultural catalogue. I do not know\r\nwhether I have made it more or less comprehensive than you wished;\r\nbut in either case, you can make it what it should be by reduction\r\nor addition--there are probably other good books with which I am\r\nunacquainted. I do not possess the Geoponica, nor Rozier's Dictionary. All\r\nthe others I have, and set them down on my own knowledge, except Young's\r\nExperimental Agriculture, which I have not, but had the benefit of reading\r\nyour copy. I am sorry to address this catalogue to Warren, instead of\r\nWashington. Never was there a moment when it was so necessary to unite all\r\nthe wisdom of the nation in its councils. Our affairs are certainly now at\r\ntheir ultimate point of crisis. I understand the Eastern Republicans will\r\nagree to nothing which shall render not-intercourse effectual, and that\r\nin any question of that kind, the Federalists will have a majority. There\r\nremains, then, only war or submission, and if we adopt the former, they\r\nwill desert us. Under these difficulties you ought not to have left us.\r\nA temporary malady was not a just ground for permanent withdrawing, and\r\nyou are too young to be entitled as yet to decline public duties. I think\r\nthere never was a time when your presence in Congress was more desirable.\r\nHowever, the die is cast, and we have only to regret what we cannot\r\nrepair. You must indulge me a little in scolding on this subject, and the\r\nrather as it is the effect of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SAMUEL KERCHEVAL.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 15, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of December 12th has been duly received, as was also\r\nthat of September 28th. With the blank subscription paper for the academy\r\nof Frederic county, enclosed in your letter of September, nothing has\r\nbeen done. I go rarely from home, and therefore have little opportunity\r\nof soliciting subscriptions. Nor could I do it in the present case in\r\nconformity with my own judgment of what is best for institutions of this\r\nkind. We are all doubtless bound to contribute a certain portion of our\r\nincome to the support of charitable and other useful public institutions.\r\nBut it is a part of our duty also to apply our contributions in the\r\nmost effectual way we can to secure their object. The question then is\r\nwhether this will not be better done by each of us appropriating our\r\nwhole contributions to the institutions within our own reach, under our\r\nown eye; and over which we can exercise some useful control? Or would\r\nit be better that each should divide the sum he can spare among all\r\nthe institutions of his State, or of the United States? Reason, and the\r\ninterest of these institutions themselves, certainly decide in favor of\r\nthe former practice. This question has been forced on me heretofore by the\r\nmultitude of applications which have come to me from every quarter of the\r\nUnion on behalf of academies, churches, missions, hospitals, charitable\r\nestablishments, &c. Had I parcelled among them all the contributions which\r\nI could spare, it would have been for each too feeble a sum to be worthy\r\nof being either given or received. If each portion of the State, on the\r\ncontrary, will apply its aids and its attentions exclusively to those\r\nnearest around them, all will be better taken care of. Their support,\r\ntheir conduct, and the best administration of their funds, will be under\r\nthe inspection and control of those most convenient to take cognizance\r\nof them, and most interested in their prosperity. With these impressions\r\nmyself, I could not propose to others what my own judgment disapproved, as\r\nto their duty as well as my own. These considerations appear so conclusive\r\nto myself, that I trust they will be a sufficient apology for my not\r\nhaving fulfilled your wishes with respect to the paper enclosed. They\r\nare therefore submitted to your candor, with assurances of my best wishes\r\nfor the success of the institution you patronize, and of my respect and\r\nconsideration for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. EPPES.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 17, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 10th came safely to hand, and I now enclose you\r\na letter from Francis; he continues in excellent health, and employs his\r\ntime well. He has written to his mamma and grandmamma. I observe that the\r\nH. of R. are sensible of the ill effects of the long speeches in their\r\nhouse on their proceedings. But they have a worse effect in the disgust\r\nthey excite among the people, and the disposition they are producing to\r\ntransfer their confidence from the legislature to the executive branch,\r\nwhich would soon sap our constitution. These speeches, therefore, are\r\nless and less read, and if continued will cease to be read at all.\r\nThe models for that oratory which is to produce the greatest effect by\r\nsecuring the attention of hearers and readers, are to be found in Livy,\r\nTacitus, Sallust, and most assuredly not in Cicero. I doubt if there is\r\na man in the world who can now read one of his orations through but as\r\na piece of task-work. I observe the house is endeavoring to remedy the\r\neternal protraction of debate by setting up all night, or by the use\r\nof the Previous Question. Both will subject them to the most serious\r\ninconvenience. The latter may be turned upon themselves by a trick of\r\ntheir adversaries. I have thought that such a rule as the following would\r\nbe more effectual and less inconvenient. \"Resolved that at [viii.] o'clock\r\nin the evening (whenever the house shall be in session at that hour) it\r\nshall be the duty of the Speaker to declare that hour arrived, whereupon\r\nall debate shall cease. If there be then before the house a main question\r\nfor the reading or passing of a bill, resolution or order, such main\r\nquestion shall immediately be put by the Speaker, and decided by yeas and\r\nnays.\r\n\r\n\"If the question before the house be secondary, as for amendment,\r\ncommitment, postponement, adjournment of the debate or question, laying\r\non the table, reading papers, or a previous question, such secondary, [or\r\nany other which may delay the main question,] shall stand _ipso facto_\r\ndischarged, and the main question shall then be before the house, and\r\nshall be immediately put and decided by yeas and nays. But a motion for\r\nadjournment of the house, may once and once only, take place of the main\r\nquestion, and if decided in the negative, the main question shall then\r\nbe put as before. Should any question of order arise, it shall be decided\r\nby the Speaker instanter, and without debate or appeal; and questions of\r\nprivilege arising, shall be postponed till the main question be decided.\r\nMessages from the President or Senate may be received but not acted on\r\ntill after the decision of the main question. But this rule shall be\r\nsuspended during the [three] last days of the session of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt this, on investigation, will be found to need amendment; but I\r\nthink the principle of it better adapted to meet the evil than any other\r\nwhich has occurred to me. You can consider and decide upon it, however,\r\nand make what use of it you please, only keeping the source of it to\r\nyourself. Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SAMUEL KERCHEVAL.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 19, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Yours of the 7th inst. has been duly received, with the pamphlet\r\nenclosed, for which I return you my thanks. Nothing can be more exactly\r\nand seriously true than what is there stated: that but a short time\r\nelapsed after the death of the great reformer of the Jewish religion,\r\nbefore his principles were departed from by those who professed to be his\r\nspecial servants, and perverted into an engine for enslaving mankind,\r\nand aggrandizing their oppressors in Church and State: that the purest\r\nsystem of morals ever before preached to man has been adulterated and\r\nsophisticated by artificial constructions, into a mere contrivance to\r\nfilch wealth and power to themselves: that rational men, not being able to\r\nswallow their impious heresies, in order to force them down their throats,\r\nthey raise the hue and cry of infidelity, while themselves are the\r\ngreatest obstacles to the advancement of the real doctrines of Jesus, and\r\ndo, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ.\r\n\r\nYou expect that your book will have some effect on the prejudices\r\nwhich the society of Friends entertain against the present and late\r\nadministrations. In this I think you will be disappointed. The Friends\r\nare men formed with the same passions, and swayed by the same natural\r\nprinciples and prejudices as others. In cases where the passions are\r\nneutral, men will display their respect for the religious _professions_\r\nof their sect. But where their passions are enlisted, these _professions_\r\nare no obstacle. You observe very truly, that both the late and present\r\nadministration conducted the government on principles _professed_ by the\r\nFriends. Our efforts to preserve peace, our measures as to the Indians,\r\nas to slavery, as to religious freedom, were all in consonance with their\r\n_profession_. Yet I never expected we should get a vote from them, and in\r\nthis I was neither deceived nor disappointed. There is no riddle in this\r\nto those who do not suffer themselves to be duped by the _professions_ of\r\nreligions sectaries. The theory of American Quakerism is a very obvious\r\none. The mother society is in England. Its members are English by birth\r\nand residence, devoted to their own country as good citizens ought to be.\r\nThe Quakers of these States are colonies or filiations from the mother\r\nsociety, to whom that society sends its yearly lessons. On these, the\r\nfiliated societies model their opinions, their conduct, their passions\r\nand attachments. A Quaker is essentially an Englishman, in whatever\r\npart of the earth he is born or lives. The outrages of Great Britain on\r\nour navigation and commerce, have kept us in perpetual bickerings with\r\nher. The Quakers here have taken side against their own government, not\r\non their _profession_ of peace, for they saw that peace was our object\r\nalso; but from devotion to the views of the mother society. In 1797-8,\r\nwhen an administration sought war with France, the Quakers were the\r\nmost clamorous for war. Their principle of peace, as a secondary one,\r\nyielded to the primary one of adherence to the Friends in England, and\r\nwhat was patriotism in the original, became treason in the copy. On that\r\noccasion, they obliged their good old leader, Mr. Pemberton, to erase his\r\nname from a petition to Congress against war, which had been delivered\r\nto a Representative of Pennsylvania, a member of the late and present\r\nadministration; he accordingly permitted the old gentleman to erase his\r\nname. You must not therefore expect that your book will have any more\r\neffect on the Society of Friends here, than on the English merchants\r\nsettled among us. I apply this to the Friends in general, not universally.\r\nI know individuals among them as good patriots as we have.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the kind wishes and sentiments towards myself, expressed\r\nin your letter, and sincerely wish to yourself the blessings of heaven and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BALDWIN.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 19, 1810.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson returns to Mr. Baldwin his thanks for the copy of the\r\nletters of Cerus and Amicus just received from him. He sincerely wishes\r\nits circulation among the Society of Friends may have the effect Mr.\r\nBaldwin expects, of abating their prejudices against the government of\r\ntheir country. But he apprehends their disease is too deeply seated; that\r\nidentifying themselves with the mother society in England, and taking\r\nfrom them implicitly their politics, their principles and passions, it\r\nwill be long before they will cease to be Englishmen in everything but the\r\nplace of their birth, and to consider that, and not America, as their real\r\ncountry. He is particularly thankful to Mr. Baldwin for the kind wishes\r\nand sentiments expressed in his letter, and sincerely wishes to him the\r\nblessings of health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS T. HEWSON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 21, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 8th inst., informing me that\r\nthe American Philosophical Society had been pleased again unanimously to\r\nre-elect me their President. For these continued testimonials of their\r\nfavor, I can but renew the expressions of my continued gratitude, and\r\nthe assurances of my entire devotion to their service. If, in my present\r\nsituation, I can in any wise forward their laudable pursuits for the\r\ninformation and benefit of mankind, all other duties shall give place to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nI pray you to be the channel of communicating these sentiments, with\r\nthe expressions of my dutiful respects to the Society, and to accept,\r\nyourself, the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE PAUL HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 23, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The enclosed letter would have been more properly addressed to\r\nyourself, or perhaps to the Secretary of War. I have no knowledge at all\r\nof the writer; but suppose the best use I can make of his letter, as to\r\nhimself or the public, is to enclose it to you for such notice only as\r\nthe public utility may entitle it to; perhaps I should ask the favor of\r\nyou to communicate it, with the samples, and with my friendly respects,\r\nto the Secretary of War, who may know something of the writer. I recollect\r\nthat his predecessor made some trial of cotton tenting, and found it good\r\nagainst the water. Its combustibility, however, must be an objection to\r\nit for that purpose, and perhaps even on shipboard. I avail myself of\r\nthe occasion which this circumstance presents of expressing my sincere\r\nanxieties for the prosperity of the administration in all its parts, which\r\nindeed involves the prosperity of us all, and of tendering to yourself in\r\nparticular the assurances of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 24, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 15th is received, and I am disconsolate on\r\nlearning my mistake as to your having a dynamometer. My object being to\r\nbring a plough to be made here to the same standard of comparison by which\r\nGuillaume's has been proved, nothing less would be satisfactory than an\r\ninstrument made by the same standard. I must import one, therefore, but\r\nhow, in the present state of non-intercourse, is the difficulty. I do\r\nnot know * * * personally, but by character well. He is the most red-hot\r\nfederalist, famous, or rather infamous for the lying and slandering\r\nwhich he vomited from the pulpit in the political harangues with which\r\nhe polluted the place. I was honored with much of it. He is a man who\r\ncan prove everything if you will take his word for proof. Such evidence\r\nof Hamilton's being a republican he may bring; but Mr. Adams, Edmund\r\nRandolph, and myself, could repeat an explicit declaration of Hamilton's\r\nagainst which * * proofs would weigh nothing.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to learn that your rural occupations impede so much the\r\nprogress of your much to be desired work. You owe to republicanism,\r\nand indeed to the future hopes of man, a faithful record of the _march_\r\nof this government, which may encourage the oppressed to go and do so\r\nlikewise. Your talents, your principles, and your means of access to\r\npublic and private sources of information, with the leisure which is at\r\nyour command, point you out as the person who is to do this act of justice\r\nto those who believe in the improvability of the condition of man, and\r\nwho have acted on that behalf, in opposition to those who consider man\r\nas a beast of burthen made to be rode by him who has genius enough to\r\nget a bridle into his mouth. The dissensions between two members of the\r\nCabinet are to be lamented. But why should these force Mr. Gallatin to\r\nwithdraw? They cannot be greater than between Hamilton and myself, and\r\nyet we served together four years in that way. We had indeed no personal\r\ndissensions. Each of us, perhaps, thought well of the other as a man,\r\nbut as politicians it was impossible for two men to be of more opposite\r\nprinciples. The method of separate consultation, practised sometimes in\r\nthe Cabinet, prevents disagreeable collisions.\r\n\r\nYou ask my opinion of Maine. I think him a most excellent man. Sober,\r\nindustrious, intelligent and conscientious. But, in the difficulty\r\nof changing a nursery establishment, I suspect you will find an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to his removal. Present me respectfully to Mrs.\r\nBarlow, and be assured of my constant and affectionate esteem.\r\n\r\nP. S. The day before yesterday the mercury was at 5½° with us, a very\r\nuncommon degree of cold here. It gave us the first ice for the ice house.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GIDEON GRANGER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 24, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was sorry, by a letter from Mr. Barlow the other day, to\r\nlearn the ill state of your health, and I sincerely wish that this may\r\nfind you better. Young, temperate and prudent as you are, great confidence\r\nmay be reposed in the provision nature has made for the restoration of\r\norder in your system when it has become deranged; she effects her object\r\nby strengthening the whole system, towards which medicine is generally\r\nmischevous. Nor are the sedentary habits of office friendly to it. But\r\nof all this your own good understanding, instructed by your experience,\r\nis the best judge. * * * * * I cannot pass over this occasion of writing\r\nto you, the first presented me since retiring from office, without\r\nexpressing to you my sense of the important aid I received from you in\r\nthe able and faithful direction of the office committed to your charge.\r\nWith such auxiliaries, the business and burthen of government becomes all\r\nbut insensible, and its painful anxieties are relieved by the certainty\r\nthat all is going right. In no department did I feel this sensation more\r\nstrongly than in yours, and though at this time of little significance\r\nto yourself, it is a relief to my mind to discharge the duty of bearing\r\nthis testimony to your valuable services. I must add my acknowledgments\r\nfor your friendly interference in setting the public judgment to rights\r\nwith respect to the Connecticut prosecutions, so falsely and maliciously\r\ncharged on me. I refer to a statement of the facts in the National\r\nIntelligencer of many months past, which I was sensible came from your\r\nhand. I pray you to be assured of my great and constant attachment, esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. J. GARLAND JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 25, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December 12th was long coming to hand. I am much\r\nconcerned to learn that any disagreeable impression was made on your mind,\r\nby the circumstances which are the subject of your letter. Permit me first\r\nto explain the principles which I had laid down for my own observance.\r\nIn a government like ours, it is the duty of the Chief Magistrate, in\r\norder to enable himself to do all the good which his station requires,\r\nto endeavor, by all honorable means, to unite in himself the confidence\r\nof the whole people. This alone, in any case where the energy of the\r\nnation is required, can produce a union of the powers of the whole, and\r\npoint them in a single direction, as if all constituted but one body\r\nand one mind, and this alone can render a weaker nation unconquerable\r\nby a stronger one. Towards acquiring the confidence of the people, the\r\nvery first measure is to satisfy them of his disinterestedness, and that\r\nhe is directing their affairs with a single eye to their good, and not\r\nto build up fortunes for himself and family, and especially, that the\r\nofficers appointed to transact their business, are appointed because\r\nthey are the fittest men, not because they are his relations. So prone\r\nare they to suspicion, that where a President appoints a relation of his\r\nown, however worthy, they will believe that favor and not merit, was the\r\nmotive. I therefore laid it down as a law of conduct for myself, never to\r\ngive an appointment to a relation. Had I felt any hesitation in adopting\r\nthis rule, examples were not wanting to admonish me what to do and what\r\nto avoid. Still, the expression of your willingness to act in any office\r\nfor which you were qualified, could not be imputed to you as blame. It\r\nwould not readily occur that a person qualified for office ought to be\r\nrejected merely because he was related to the President, and the then more\r\nrecent examples favored the other opinion. In this light I considered the\r\ncase as presenting itself to your mind, and that the application might\r\nbe perfectly justifiable on your part, while, for reasons occurring to\r\nnone perhaps, but the person in my situation, the public interest might\r\nrender it unadvisable. Of this, however, be assured that I considered the\r\nproposition as innocent on your part, and that it never lessened my esteem\r\nfor you, or the interest I felt in your welfare.\r\n\r\nMy stay in Amelia was too short, (only twenty-four hours,) to expect the\r\npleasure of seeing you there. It would be a happiness to me any where,\r\nbut especially here, from whence I am rarely absent. I am leading a\r\nlife of considerable activity as a farmer, reading little and writing\r\nless. Something pursued with ardor is necessary to guard us from the\r\n_tedium-vitæ_, and the active pursuits lessen most our sense of the\r\ninfirmities of age. That to the health of youth you may add an old age of\r\nvigor, is the sincere prayer of\r\n\r\n                                                     Yours, affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE DAVID CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 28, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of November 5th, was two months on its passage to\r\nme. I am very thankful for all the kind expressions of friendship in it,\r\nand I consider it a great felicity, through a long and trying course of\r\nlife, to have retained the esteem of my early friends unaltered. I find in\r\nold age that the impressions of youth are the deepest and most indelible.\r\nSome friends, indeed, have left me by the way, seeking, by a different\r\npolitical path, the same object, their country's good, which I pursued\r\nwith the crowd along the common highway. It is a satisfaction to me that\r\nI was not the first to leave them. I have never thought that a difference\r\nin political, any more than in religious opinions, should disturb the\r\nfriendly intercourse of society. There are so many other topics on which\r\nfriends may converse and be happy, that it is wonderful they would select,\r\nof preference, the only one on which they cannot agree. I am sensible\r\nof the mark of esteem manifested by the name you have given to your son.\r\nTell him from me, that he must consider as essentially belonging to it,\r\nto love his friends and wish no ill to his enemies. I shall be happy to\r\nsee him here whenever any circumstance shall lead his footsteps this way.\r\nYou doubt, between law and physic, which profession he shall adopt. His\r\npeculiar turn of mind, and your own knowledge of things will best decide\r\nthis question. Law is quite overdone. It is fallen to the ground, and\r\na man must have great powers to raise himself in it to either honor or\r\nprofit. The mob of the profession get as little money and less respect,\r\nthan they would by digging the earth. The followers of Esculapius are\r\nalso numerous. Yet I have remarked that wherever one sets himself down\r\nin a good neighborhood, not pre-occupied, he secures to himself its\r\npractice, and if prudent, is not long in acquiring whereon to retire and\r\nlive in comfort. The physician is happy in the attachment of the families\r\nin which he practices. All think he has saved some one of them, and he\r\nfinds himself everywhere a welcome guest, a home in every house. If, to\r\nthe consciousness of having saved some lives, he can add that of having\r\nat no time, from want of caution, destroyed the boon he was called on to\r\nsave, he will enjoy, in age, the happy reflection of not having lived in\r\nvain; while the lawyer has only to recollect how many, by his dexterity,\r\nhave been cheated of their right and reduced to beggary. After all, I end\r\nwhere I began, with the observation that your son's disposition and your\r\nprudence, are the best arbiters of this question, and with the assurances\r\nof my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CÆSAR A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 10, 1810.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have to thank you for your favor of the 31st ultimo,\r\nwhich is just now received. It has been peculiarly unfortunate for\r\nus, personally, that the portion in the history of mankind, at which\r\nwe were called to take a share in the direction of their affairs, was\r\nsuch an one as history has never before presented. At any other period,\r\nthe even-handed justice we have observed towards all nations, the\r\nefforts we have made to merit their esteem by every act which candor or\r\nliberality could exercise, would have preserved our peace, and secured\r\nthe unqualified confidence of all other nations in our faith and probity.\r\nBut the hurricane which is now blasting the world, physical and moral,\r\nhas prostrated all the mounds of reason as well as right. All those\r\ncalculations which, at any other period, would have been deemed honorable,\r\nof the existence of a moral sense in man, individually or associated,\r\nof the connection which the laws of nature have established between his\r\nduties and his interests, of a regard for honest fame and the esteem of\r\nour fellow men, have been a matter of reproach on us, as evidences of\r\nimbecility. As if it could be a folly for an honest man to suppose that\r\nothers could be honest also, when it is their interest to be so. And when\r\nis this state of things to end? The death of Bonaparte would, to be sure,\r\nremove the first and chiefest apostle of the desolation of men and morals,\r\nand might withdraw the scourge of the land. But what is to restore order\r\nand safety on the ocean? The death of George III? Not at all. He is only\r\nstupid; and his ministers, however weak and profligate in morals, are\r\nephemeral. But his nation is permanent, and it is that which is the tyrant\r\nof the ocean. The principle that force is right, is become the principle\r\nof the nation itself. They would not permit an honest minister, were\r\naccident to bring such an one into power, to relax their system of lawless\r\npiracy. These were the difficulties when I was with you. I know they are\r\nnot lessened, and I pity you.\r\n\r\nIt is a blessing, however, that our people are reasonable; that they\r\nare kept so well informed of the state of things as to judge for\r\nthemselves, to see the true sources of their difficulties, and to maintain\r\ntheir confidence undiminished in the wisdom and integrity of their\r\nfunctionaries. _Macte virtute_ therefore. Continue to go straight forward,\r\npursuing always that which is right, as the only clue which can lead us\r\nout of the labyrinth. Let nothing be spared of either reason or passion,\r\nto preserve the public confidence entire, as the only rock of our safety.\r\nIn times of peace the people look most to their representatives; but in\r\nwar, to the executive solely. It is visible that their confidence is even\r\nnow veering in that direction; that they are looking to the executive\r\nto give the proper direction to their affairs, with a confidence as\r\nauspicious as it is well founded.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this, the first occasion of writing to you, to express\r\nall the depth of my affection for you; the sense I entertain of your\r\nfaithful co-operation in my late labors, and the debt I owe for the\r\nvaluable aid I received from you. Though separated from my fellow laborers\r\nin place and pursuit, my affections are with you all, and I offer daily\r\nprayers that ye love one another, as I love you. God bless you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO REV. MR. KNOX.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 12, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of January 22d loitered on the way somewhere, so as not\r\nto come to my hand until the 5th inst. The title of the tract of Buchanan\r\nwhich you propose to translate, was familiar to me, and I possessed the\r\ntract; but no circumstance had ever led me to look into it. Yet I think\r\nnothing more likely than that, in the free spirit of that age and state\r\nof society, principles should be avowed, which were felt and followed,\r\nalthough unwritten in the Scottish constitution. Undefined powers had\r\nbeen entrusted to the crown, undefined rights retained by the people, and\r\nthese depended for their maintenance on the spirit of the people, which,\r\nin that day was dependence sufficient. I shall certainly, after what you\r\nsay of it, give it a serious reading. His latinity is so pure as to claim\r\na place in school reading, and the sentiments which have recommended the\r\nwork to your notice, are such as ought to be instilled into the minds of\r\nour youth on their first opening. The boys of the rising generation are\r\nto be the men of the next, and the sole guardians of the principles we\r\ndeliver over to them. That I have acted through life on those of sincere\r\nrepublicanism I feel in every fibre of my constitution. And when men who\r\nfeel like myself, bear witness in my favor, my satisfaction is complete.\r\nThe testimony of approbation implied in the desire you express of coupling\r\nmy name with Buchanan's work, and your translation of it, cannot but be\r\nacceptable and flattering; and the more so as coming from one of whom\r\na small acquaintance had inspired me with a great esteem. This I am now\r\nhappy in finding an occasion to express. The times which brought us within\r\nmutual observation were awfully trying. But truth and reason are eternal.\r\nThey have prevailed. And they will eternally prevail, however, in times\r\nand places they may be overborne for a while by violence, military, civil,\r\nor ecclesiastical. The preservation of the holy fire is confided to us by\r\nthe world, and the sparks which will emanate from it will ever serve to\r\nrekindle it in other quarters of the globe, _numinibus secundis_.\r\n\r\nAmidst the immense mass of detraction which was published against me,\r\nwhen my fellow citizens proposed to entrust me with their concerns, and\r\nthe efforts of more candid minds to expose their falsehood, I retain a\r\nremembrance of the pamphlet you mention. But I never before learned who\r\nwas its author; nor was it known to me that Mr. Pechin had ever published\r\na copy of the Notes on Virginia. But had all this been known, I should\r\nhave seen myself with pride by your side. Wherever you lead, we may all\r\nsafely follow, assured that it is in the path of truth and liberty. Mr.\r\nPechin knew well that your introduction would plead for his author, and\r\nonly erred in not asking your leave. Wishing every good effect which may\r\nfollow your undertaking, I tender you the assurances of my high esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. D. G. WORTHINGTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 24, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have to thank you for the pamphlet you have been so kind as\r\nto send me, and especially for its contents so far as they respect\r\nmyself personally. I had before read your speech in the newspapers,\r\nwith great satisfaction, and the more, as, besides the able defence of\r\nthe government, I saw that an absent and retired servant would still\r\nfind, in the justice of the public counsellors, friendly advocates who\r\nwould not suffer his name to be maligned without answer or reproof.\r\nIf, brooding over past calamities, the attentions of federalism can, by\r\nabusing me, be diverted from disturbing the course of government, they\r\nwill make me useful longer than I had expected to be so. Having served\r\nthem faithfully for a term of twelve or fourteen years, in the terrific\r\nstation of Rawhead and Bloodybones, it was supposed that, retired from\r\npower, I should have been _functus officio_, of course, for them also.\r\nIf, nevertheless, they wish my continuance in that awful office, I yield,\r\nand the rather as it may be exercised at home, without interfering with\r\nthe tranquil enjoyment of my farm, my family, my friends and books. In\r\ntruth, having never felt a pain from their abuse, I bear them no malice.\r\nContented with our government, elective as it is in three of its principal\r\nbranches, I wish not, on Hamilton's plan, to see two of them for life;\r\nand still less, hereditary, as others desire. I believe that the yeomanry\r\nof the Federalists think on this subject with me. They are substantially\r\nrepublican. But some of their leaders, who get into the public councils,\r\nwould prefer Hamilton's government, and still more the hereditary one.\r\n_Hinc illæ lachrymæ_, I wish them no harm, but that they may never get\r\ninto power, not _for their harm_, but for the good of our country. I hope\r\nthe friends of republican government will keep strict watch over them, and\r\nnot let them want, when they need it, the wholesome discipline of which\r\nyou have sent me a specimen. I commit them with entire confidence to your\r\ncare, and salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BURWELL.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 25, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 16th, has given me real uneasiness. I was\r\ncertainly very unfortunate in the choice of my expression, when I hit\r\nupon one which could excite any doubt of my unceasing affections for\r\nyou. In observing that you might use the information as you should find\r\nproper, I meant merely that you might communicate it to the President, the\r\nSecretaries of State or War, or to young Mr. Lee, as should be judged by\r\nyourself most proper. I meant particularly, to permit its communication\r\nto Mr. Lee, to enlighten his enquiries, for I do not know that his\r\nfather received the medal. I could only conduct the information to the\r\ncompletion of the dye and striking off a proof. With such assurances as\r\nI have of your affection, be assured that nothing but the most direct and\r\nunequivocal proofs can ever make me suspect its abatement, and conscious\r\nof as warm feelings towards yourself, I hope you will ever be as unready\r\nto doubt them. Let us put this, then, under our feet.\r\n\r\nI like your convoy bill, because although it does not assume the\r\nmaintenance of all our maritime rights, it assumes as much as it is our\r\ninterest to maintain. Our coasting trade is the first and most important\r\nbranch, never to be yielded but with our existence. Next to that is the\r\ncarriage of our own productions in our own vessels, and bringing back the\r\nreturns for our own consumption; so far I would protect it, and force\r\nevery part of the Union to join in the protection at the point of the\r\nbayonet. But though we have a right to the remaining branch of carrying\r\nfor other nations, its advantages do not compensate its risks. Your bill\r\nfirst rallies us to the ground the constitution ought to have taken,\r\nand to which we ought to return without delay; the moment is the most\r\nfavorable possible, because the Eastern States, by declaring they will not\r\nprotect that cabotage by war, and forcing us to abandon it, have released\r\nus from every future claim for its protection on that part. Your bill is\r\nexcellent in another view: it presents still one other ground to which we\r\ncan retire before we resort to war; it says to the belligerents, rather\r\nthan go to war, we will retire from the brokerage of other nations, and\r\nconfine ourselves to the carriage and exchange of our own productions; but\r\nwe will vindicate that in all its rights--if you touch it, it is war.\r\n\r\nThe present delightful weather has drawn us all into our farms and\r\ngardens; we have had the most devastating rain which has ever fallen\r\nwithin my knowledge. Three inches of water fell in the space of about\r\nan hour. Every hollow of every hill presented a torrent which swept\r\neverything before it. I have never seen the fields so much injured. Mr.\r\nRandolph's farm is the only one which has not suffered; his horizontal\r\nfurrows arrested the water at every step till it was absorbed, or at least\r\nhad deposited the soil it had taken up. Everybody in this neighborhood is\r\nadopting his method of ploughing, except tenants who have no interest in\r\nthe preservation of the soil.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Burwell, and be assured of my constant\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 26, 1810.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL AND FRIEND,--I have rarely written to you; never but by\r\nsafe conveyances; and avoiding everything political, lest coming from\r\none in the station I then held, it might be imputed injuriously to our\r\ncountry, or perhaps even excite jealousy of you. Hence my letters were\r\nnecessarily dry. Retired now from public concerns, totally unconnected\r\nwith them, and avoiding all curiosity about what is done or intended,\r\nwhat I say is from myself only, the workings of my own mind, imputable to\r\nnobody else.\r\n\r\nThe anxieties which I know you have felt, on seeing exposed to the\r\njustlings of a warring world, a country to which, in early life, you\r\ndevoted your sword and services when oppressed by foreign dominion, were\r\nworthy of your philanthropy and disinterested attachment to the freedom\r\nand happiness of man. Although we have not made all the provisions\r\nwhich might be necessary for a war in the field of Europe, yet we\r\nhave not been inattentive to such as would be necessary here. From the\r\nmoment that the affair of the Chesapeake rendered the prospect of war\r\nimminent, every faculty was exerted to be prepared for it, and I think\r\nI may venture to solace you with the assurance, that we are, in a good\r\ndegree, prepared. Military stores for many campaigns are on hand, all\r\nthe necessary articles (sulphur excepted), and the art of preparing them\r\namong ourselves, abundantly; arms in our magazines for more men than will\r\never be required in the field, and forty thousand new stand yearly added,\r\nof our own fabrication, superior to any we have ever seen from Europe;\r\nheavy artillery much beyond our need; an increasing stock of field pieces,\r\nseveral foundries casting one every other day each; a military school of\r\nabout fifty students, which has been in operation a dozen years; and the\r\nmanufacture of men constantly going on, and adding forty thousand young\r\nsoldiers to our force every year that the war is deferred; at all our\r\nseaport towns of the least consequence we have erected works of defence,\r\nand assigned them gunboats, carrying one or two heavy pieces, either\r\neighteen, twenty-four, or thirty-two pounders, sufficient in the smaller\r\nharbors to repel the predatory attacks of privateers or single armed\r\nships, and proportioned in the larger harbors to such more serious attacks\r\nas they may probably be exposed to. All these were nearly completed, and\r\ntheir gunboats in readiness, when I retired from the government. The works\r\nof New York and New Orleans alone, being on a much larger scale, are not\r\nyet completed. The former will be finished this summer, mounting four\r\nhundred and thirty-eight guns, and, with the aid of from fifty to one\r\nhundred gunboats, will be adequate to the resistance of any fleet which\r\nwill ever be trusted across the Atlantic. The works for New Orleans are\r\nless advanced. These are our preparations. They are very different from\r\nwhat you will be told by newspapers, and travellers, even Americans. But\r\nit is not to them the government communicates the public condition. Ask\r\none of them if he knows the exact state of any particular harbor, and you\r\nwill find probably that he does not know even that of the one he comes\r\nfrom. You will ask, perhaps, where are the proof of these preparations\r\nfor one who cannot go and see them. I answer, in the acts of Congress,\r\nauthorizing such preparations, and in your knowledge of me, that, if\r\nauthorized, they would be executed.\r\n\r\nTwo measures have not been adopted, which I pressed on Congress repeatedly\r\nat their meetings. The one, to settle the whole ungranted territory of\r\nOrleans, by donations of land to able-bodied young men, to be engaged\r\nand carried there at the public expense, who would constitute a force\r\nalways ready on the spot to defend New Orleans. The other was, to class\r\nthe militia according to the years of their birth, and make all those\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-five liable to be trained and called into service\r\nat a moment's warning. This would have given us a force of three hundred\r\nthousand young men, prepared by proper training, for service in any part\r\nof the United States; while those who had passed through that period would\r\nremain at home, liable to be used in their own or adjacent States. These\r\ntwo measures would have completed what I deemed necessary for the entire\r\nsecurity of our country. They would have given me, on my retirement from\r\nthe government of the nation, the consolatory reflection, that having\r\nfound, when I was called to it, not a single seaport town in a condition\r\nto repel a levy of contribution by a single privateer or pirate, I\r\nhad left every harbor so prepared by works and gunboats, as to be in a\r\nreasonable state of security against any probable attack; the territory\r\nof Orleans acquired, and planted with an internal force sufficient for its\r\nprotection; and the whole territory of the United States organized by such\r\na classification of its male force, as would give it the benefit of all\r\nits young population for active service, and that of a middle and advanced\r\nage for stationary defence. But these measures will, I hope, be completed\r\nby my successor, who, to the purest principles of republican patriotism,\r\nadds a wisdom and foresight second to no man on earth.\r\n\r\nSo much as to my country. Now a word as to myself. I am retired to\r\nMonticello, where, in the bosom of my family, and surrounded by my books,\r\nI enjoy a repose to which I have been long a stranger. My mornings are\r\ndevoted to correspondence. From breakfast to dinner, I am in my shops,\r\nmy garden, or on horseback among my farms; from dinner to dark, I give\r\nto society and recreation with my neighbors and friends; and from candle\r\nlight to early bed-time, I read. My health is perfect; and my strength\r\nconsiderably reinforced by the activity of the course I pursue; perhaps\r\nit is as great as usually falls to the lot of near sixty-seven years of\r\nage. I talk of ploughs and harrows, of seeding and harvesting, with my\r\nneighbors, and of politics too, if they choose, with as little reserve as\r\nthe rest of my fellow citizens, and feel, at length, the blessing of being\r\nfree to say and do what I please, without being responsible for it to\r\nany mortal. A part of my occupation, and by no means the least pleasing,\r\nis the direction of the studies of such young men as ask it. They place\r\nthemselves in the neighboring village, and have the use of my library and\r\ncounsel, and make a part of my society. In advising the course of their\r\nreading, I endeavor to keep their attention fixed on the main objects of\r\nall science, the freedom and happiness of man. So that coming to bear a\r\nshare in the councils and government of their country, they will keep ever\r\nin view the sole objects of all legitimate government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstead of the unalloyed happiness of retiring unembarrassed and\r\nindependent, to the enjoyment of my estate, which is ample for my limited\r\nviews, I have to pass such a length of time in a thraldom of mind never\r\nbefore known to me. Except for this, my happiness would have been perfect.\r\nThat yours may never know disturbance, and that you may enjoy as many\r\nyears of life, as health and ease to yourself shall wish, is the sincere\r\nprayer of your constant and affectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 5, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received duly you favor of the 19th ultimo, and I salute\r\nyou with all ancient and recent recollections of friendship. I have\r\nlearned, with real sorrow, that circumstances have arisen among our\r\nexecutive counsellors, which have rendered foes those who once were\r\nfriends. To themselves it will be a source of infinite pain and vexation,\r\nand therefore chiefly I lament it, for I have a sincere esteem for both\r\nparties. To the President it will be really inconvenient; but to the\r\nnation I do not know that it can do serious injury, unless we were to\r\nbelieve the newspapers, which pretend that Mr. Gallatin will go out.\r\nThat indeed would be a day of mourning for the United States; but I hope\r\nthat the position of both gentlemen may be made so easy as to give no\r\ncause for either to withdraw. The ordinary business of every day is done\r\nby consultation between the President and the Head of the department\r\nalone to which it belongs. For measures of importance or difficulty, a\r\nconsultation is held with the Heads of departments, either assembled,\r\nor by taking their opinions separately in conversation or in writing.\r\nThe latter is most strictly in the spirit of the constitution. Because\r\nthe President, on weighing the advice of all, is left free to make up an\r\nopinion for himself. In this way they are not brought together, and it\r\nis not necessarily known to any what opinion the others have given. This\r\nwas General Washington's practice for the first two or three years of\r\nhis administration, till the affairs of France and England threatened to\r\nembroil us, and rendered consideration and discussion desirable. In these\r\ndiscussions, Hamilton and myself were daily pitted in the cabinet like two\r\ncocks. We were then but four in number, and, according to the majority,\r\nwhich of course was three to one, the President decided. The pain was\r\nfor Hamilton and myself, but the public experienced no inconvenience.\r\nI practised this last method, because the harmony was so cordial among\r\nus all, that we never failed, by a contribution of mutual views on the\r\nsubject, to form an opinion acceptable to the whole. I think there never\r\nwas one instance to the contrary, in any case of consequence. Yet this\r\ndoes, in fact, transform the executive into a directory, and I hold the\r\nother method to be more constitutional. It is better calculated too to\r\nprevent collision and irritation, and to cure it, or at least suppress its\r\neffects when it has already taken place. It is the obvious and sufficient\r\nremedy in the present ease, and will doubtless be resorted to.\r\n\r\nOur difficulties are indeed great, if we consider ourselves alone.\r\nBut when viewed in comparison to those of Europe, they are the joys of\r\nParadise. In the eternal revolution of ages, the destinies have placed\r\nour portion of existence amidst such scenes of tumult and outrage, as no\r\nother period, within our knowledge, had presented. Every government but\r\none on the continent of Europe, demolished, a conqueror roaming over the\r\nearth with havoc and destruction, a pirate spreading misery and ruin over\r\nthe face of the ocean. Indeed, my friend, ours is a bed of roses. And the\r\nsystem of government which shall keep us afloat amidst the wreck of the\r\nworld, will be immortalized in history. We have, to be sure, our petty\r\nsquabbles and heart burnings, and we have something of the blue devils\r\nat times, as to these raw heads and bloody bones who are eating up other\r\nnations. But happily for us, the Mammoth cannot swim, nor the Leviathan\r\nmove on dry land; and if we will keep out of their way, they cannot get\r\nat us. If, indeed, we choose to place ourselves within the scope of their\r\ntether, a gripe of the paw, or flounce of the tail, may be our fortune.\r\nOur business certainly was to be still. But a part of our nation chose\r\nto declare against this, in such a way as to control the wisdom of the\r\ngovernment. I yielded with others, to avoid a greater evil. But from that\r\nmoment, I have seen no system which could keep us entirely aloof from\r\nthese agents of destruction. If there be any, I am certain that you, my\r\nfriends, now charged with the care of us all, will see and pursue it. I\r\ngive myself, therefore, no trouble with thinking or puzzling about it.\r\nBeing confident in my watchmen I sleep soundly. God bless you all, and\r\nsend you a safe deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR LANGDON.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 5, 1810.\r\n\r\nYour letter, my dear friend, of the 18th ultimo, comes like the refreshing\r\ndews of the evening on a thirsty soil. It recalls ancient as well as\r\nrecent recollections, very dear to my heart. For five and thirty years\r\nwe have walked together through a land of tribulations. Yet these have\r\npassed away, and so, I trust, will those of the present day. The toryism\r\nwith which we struggled in '77, differed but in name from the federalism\r\nof '99, with which we struggled also; and the Anglicism of 1808, against\r\nwhich we are now struggling, is but the same thing still in another form.\r\nIt is a longing for a King, and an English King rather than any other.\r\nThis is the true source of their sorrows and wailings.\r\n\r\nThe fear that Bonaparte will come over to us and conquer us also, is\r\ntoo chimerical to be genuine. Supposing him to have finished Spain and\r\nPortugal, he has yet England and Russia to subdue. The maxim of war was\r\nnever sounder than in this case, not to leave an enemy in the rear; and\r\nespecially where an insurrectionary flame is known to be under the embers,\r\nmerely smothered, and ready to burst at every point. These two subdued,\r\n(and surely the Anglomen will not think the conquest of England alone a\r\nshort work,) ancient Greece and Macedonia, the cradle of Alexander, his\r\nprototype, and Constantinople, the seat of empire for the world, would\r\nglitter more in his eye than our bleak mountains and rugged forests.\r\nEgypt, too, and the golden apples of Mauritania, have for more than half\r\na century fixed the longing eyes of France; and with Syria, you know, he\r\nhas an old affront to wipe out. Then come \"Pontus and Galatia, Cappadocia,\r\nAsia and Bithynia,\" the fine countries, on the Euphrates and Tigris, the\r\nOxus and Indus, and all beyond the Hyphasis, which bounded the glories of\r\nhis Macedonian rival; with the invitations of his new British subjects\r\non the banks of the Ganges, whom, after receiving under his protection\r\nthe mother country, he cannot refuse to visit. When all this done and\r\nsettled, and nothing of the old world remains unsubdued, he may turn to\r\nthe new one. But will he attack us first, from whom he will get but hard\r\nknocks and no money? Or will he first lay hold of the gold and silver of\r\nMexico and Peru, and the diamonds of Brazil? A _republican_ Emperor, from\r\nhis affection to republics, independent of motives of expediency, must\r\ngrant to ours the Cyclop's boon of being the last devoured. While all this\r\nis doing, we are to suppose the chapter of accidents read out, and that\r\nnothing can happen to cut short or to disturb his enterprises.\r\n\r\nBut the Anglomen, it seems, have found out a much safer dependence than\r\nall these chances of death or disappointment. That is, that we should\r\nfirst let England plunder us, as she has been doing for years, for fear\r\nBonaparte should do it; and then ally ourselves with her, and enter into\r\nthe war. A conqueror, whose career England could not arrest when aided\r\nby Russia, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, she is now to\r\ndestroy, with all these on his side, by the aid of the United States\r\nalone. This, indeed, is making us a mighty people. And what is to be\r\nour security, that when embarked for her in the war, she will not make a\r\nseparate peace, and leave us in the lurch? Her good faith! The faith of a\r\nnation of merchants! The _Punica fides_ of modern Carthage! Of the friend\r\nand protectress of Copenhagen! Of the nation who never admitted a chapter\r\nof morality into her political code! And is now boldly avowing that\r\nwhatever power can make hers, is hers of right. Money, and not morality,\r\nis the principle of commerce and commercial nations. But, in addition to\r\nthis, the nature of the English Government forbids, of itself, reliance\r\non her engagements; and it is well known she has been the least faithful\r\nto her alliances of any nation of Europe, since the period of her history\r\nwherein she has been distinguished for her commerce and corruption, that\r\nis to say, under the houses of Stuart and Brunswick. To Portugal alone\r\nshe has steadily adhered, because, by her Methuen treaty, she had made\r\nit a colony, and one of the most valuable to her. It may be asked, what,\r\nin the nature of her government, unfits England for the observation of\r\nmoral duties? In the first place, her King is a cypher; his only function\r\nbeing to name the oligarchy which is to govern her. The parliament is,\r\nby corruption, the mere instrument of the will of the administration. The\r\nreal power and property in the government is in the great aristocratical\r\nfamilies of the nation. The nest of office being too small for all of them\r\nto cuddle into at once, the contest is eternal, which shall crowd the\r\nother out. For this purpose, they are divided into two parties, the Ins\r\nand the Outs, so equal in weight that a small matter turns the balance. To\r\nkeep themselves in, when they are in, every stratagem must be practised,\r\nevery artifice used which may flatter the pride, the passions or power of\r\nthe nation. Justice, honor, faith must yield to the necessity of keeping\r\nthemselves in place. The question whether a measure is moral, is never\r\nasked; but whether it will nourish the avarice of their merchants, or\r\nthe piratical spirit of their navy, or produce any other effect which\r\nmay strengthen them in their places. As to engagements, however positive,\r\nentered into by the predecessors of the Ins, why, they were their enemies;\r\nthey did everything which was wrong; and to reverse everything which they\r\ndid, must, therefore, be right. This is the true character of the English\r\ngovernment in practice, however different its theory; and it presents the\r\nsingular phenomenon of a nation, the individuals of which are as faithful\r\nto their private engagements and duties, as honorable, as worthy, as those\r\nof any nation on earth, and whose government is yet the most unprincipled\r\nat this day known. In an absolute government there can be no such\r\nequiponderant parties. The despot is the government. His power suppressing\r\nall opposition, maintains his ministers firm in their places. What he has\r\ncontracted, therefore, through them, he has the power to observe with good\r\nfaith; and he identifies his own honor and faith with that of his nation.\r\n\r\nWhen I observed, however, that the King of England was a cypher, I did\r\nnot mean to confine the observation to the mere individual now on that\r\nthrone. The practice of Kings marrying only in the families of Kings, has\r\nbeen that of Europe for some centuries. Now, take any race of animals,\r\nconfine them in idleness and inaction, whether in a stye, a stable\r\nor a state-room, pamper them with high diet, gratify all their sexual\r\nappetites, immerse them in sensualities, nourish their passions, let\r\neverything bend before them, and banish whatever might lead them to think,\r\nand in a few generations they become all body and no mind; and this, too,\r\nby a law of nature, by that very law by which we are in the constant\r\npractice of changing the characters and propensities of the animals we\r\nraise for our own purposes. Such is the regimen in raising Kings, and in\r\nthis way they have gone on for centuries. While in Europe, I often amused\r\nmyself with contemplating the characters of the then reigning sovereigns\r\nof Europe. Louis the XVI. was a fool, of my own knowledge, and in despite\r\nof the answers made for him at his trial. The King of Spain was a fool,\r\nand of Naples the same. They passed their lives in hunting, and despatched\r\ntwo couriers a week, one thousand miles, to let each other know what game\r\nthey had killed the preceding days. The King of Sardinia was a fool. All\r\nthese were Bourbons. The Queen of Portugal, a Braganza, was an idiot by\r\nnature. And so was the King of Denmark. Their sons, as regents, exercised\r\nthe powers of government. The King of Prussia, successor to the great\r\nFrederick, was a mere hog in body as well as in mind. Gustavus of Sweden,\r\nand Joseph of Austria, were really crazy, and George of England, you know,\r\nwas in a straight waistcoat. There remained, then, none but old Catharine,\r\nwho had been too lately picked up to have lost her common sense. In\r\nthis state Bonaparte found Europe; and it was this state of its rulers\r\nwhich lost it with scarce a struggle. These animals had become without\r\nmind and powerless; and so will every hereditary monarch be after a few\r\ngenerations. Alexander, the grandson of Catharine, is as yet an exception.\r\nHe is able to hold his own. But he is only of the third generation. His\r\nrace is not yet worn out. And so endeth the book of Kings, from all of\r\nwhom the Lord deliver us, and have you, my friend, and all such good men\r\nand true, in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ABBE SALIMANKIS.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 14, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of February 27th and am very\r\nthankful for the friendly sentiments therein expressed towards myself, as\r\nwell as for the pamphlet enclosed. That it contains many serious truths\r\nand sound admonitions every reader will be sensible. At the same time it\r\nis a comfort that the medal has two sides. I do not myself contemplate\r\nhuman nature in quite so sombre a view. That there is much vice and\r\nmisery in the world, I know; but more virtue and happiness I believe,\r\nat least in our part of it; the latter being the lot of those employed\r\nin agriculture in a greater degree than of other callings. That we are\r\noverdone with banking institutions, which have banished the precious\r\nmetals, and substituted a more fluctuating and unsafe medium, that these\r\nhave withdrawn capital from useful improvements and employments to nourish\r\nidleness, that the wars of the world have swollen our commerce beyond the\r\nwholesome limits of exchanging our own productions for our own wants, and\r\nthat, for the emolument of a small proportion of our society, who prefer\r\nthese demoralizing pursuits to labors useful to the whole, the peace\r\nof the whole is endangered, and all our present difficulties produced,\r\nare evils more easily to be deplored than remedied. They should lead\r\nus to direct our prayers, if our philanthropy fails to do it, for the\r\nre-establishment of peace in Europe, when our commerce must of course\r\nreturn to its proper objects, and the idle to habits of industry. To these\r\nprayers, in which you will not fail to join, let me add my best wishes and\r\nrespects for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. FULTON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 17, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favor of February 24th covering\r\none of your pamphlets on the Torpedo. I have read it with pleasure.\r\nThis was not necessary to give them favor in my eye. I am not afraid\r\nof new inventions or improvements, nor bigoted to the practices of our\r\nforefathers. It is that bigotry which keeps the Indians in a state of\r\nbarbarism in the midst of the arts, would have kept us in the same state\r\neven now, and still keeps Connecticut where their ancestors were when they\r\nlanded on these shores. I am much pleased that Congress is taking up the\r\nbusiness. Where a new invention is supported by well-known principles,\r\nand promises to be useful, it ought to be tried. Your torpedoes will be\r\nto cities what vaccination has been to mankind. It extinguishes their\r\ngreatest danger. But there will still be navies. Not for the destruction\r\nof cities, but for the plunder of commerce on the high seas. That the\r\ntories should be against you is in character, because it will curtail the\r\npower of their idol, England.\r\n\r\nI am thankful to you for the trouble you have taken in thinking of the\r\nfelier hydraulique. To be put into motion by the same power which was to\r\ncontinue the motion was certainly wanting to that machine, as a better\r\nname still is. I would not give you the trouble of having a model made, as\r\nI have workmen who can execute from the drawing. I pray you to accept the\r\nassurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. VOOLIF, PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE FIRST CLASS OF THE ROYAL\r\nINSTITUTE OF SCIENCES, OF LITERATURE AND OF FINE ARTS, AT AMSTERDAM.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 2d, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of the 10th of May of the last year came but lately\r\nto my hands. I am duly sensible of the honor done me by the first class\r\nof the Royal Institute of sciences, of literature, and of fine arts, in\r\nassociating me to their class, and by the approbation which his majesty\r\nthe king of Holland has condescended to give to their choice. His\r\npatronage of institutions for extending among mankind the boundaries of\r\ninformation, proves his just sense of the cares devolved on him by his\r\nhigh station, and commands the approving voice of all the sons of men. If\r\nmine can be heard from this distance among them, it will be through the\r\nbenefit of the special communication which your position may procure it,\r\nand which I am to request. I pray you to present also my thanks to the\r\nfirst class for this mark of their distinction, which I receive with due\r\nsensibility and gratitude. Sincerely a friend to science, and feeling the\r\nfraternal relation it establishes among the whole family of its votaries,\r\nwheresoever dispersed through nations friendly or hostile, I shall be\r\nhappy at all times in fulfilling any particular views which the society\r\nmay extend to this region of the globe, and in being made useful to them\r\nin any special services they will be pleased to give me an opportunity\r\nof rendering. To yourself, Sir, I tender the assurances of my particular\r\nrespect and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 3d, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR, Your favor of February 1st lately came to my hands. It brings me new\r\nproofs, in the resolutions it enclosed, of the indulgence with which the\r\nlegislature of Orleans has been pleased to view my conduct in the various\r\nduties assigned to me by our common country. The times in which we have\r\nlived have called for all the services which any of its citizens could\r\nrender, and if mine have met approbation they are fully rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe interposition noticed by the Legislature of Orleans was an act of\r\nduty of the office I then occupied. Charged with the care of the general\r\ninterest of the nation, and among these with the preservation of their\r\nlands from intrusion, I exercised, on their behalf, a right given by\r\nnature to all men, individual or associated, that of rescuing their\r\nown property wrongfully taken. In cases of forcible entry on individual\r\npossessions, special provisions, both of the common and civil law, have\r\nrestrained the right of rescue by private force, and substituted the aid\r\nof the civil power. But no law has restrained the right of the nation\r\nitself from removing by its own arm, intruders on its possessions. On\r\nthe contrary, a statute recently passed, had required that such removals\r\nshould be diligently made. The Batture of New Orleans, being a part of the\r\nbed contained between the two banks of the river, a naked shoal indeed\r\nat low water, but covered through the whole season of its regular full\r\ntides, and then forming the ground of the port and harbor for the upper\r\nnavigation, over which vessels ride of necessity when moored to the bank,\r\nI deemed it public property, in which all had a common use. The removal,\r\ntoo, of the force which had possessed itself of it, was the more urgent\r\nfrom the interruption it might give to the commerce, and other lawful\r\nuses, of the inhabitants of the city and of the Western waters generally.\r\n\r\nIf this aid from the public authority was particularly interesting\r\nto the territory of Orleans, it certainly adds new satisfaction to my\r\nconsciousness of having done what was right.\r\n\r\nI ask the favor of you to convey to the Legislature of Orleans, my\r\ngratitude for the interest they are so kind as to express in my future\r\nhappiness; and I pray to the Governor of the Universe, that He may always\r\nhave them and our country in his holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 3, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of January 12th and February 1st, came to hand\r\nonly a fortnight ago. The enclosed contains my answer to the latter, for\r\ncommunication to the Legislature. So many false views on the subject of\r\nthe batture have been presented in and out of Congress, that duty to\r\nmyself, as well as justice to the citizens of New Orleans and of the\r\nwestern country generally, required that I should avail myself of the\r\noccasion these resolutions presented, of stating, in the fewest words\r\npossible, the true ground of my conduct, and, as I think, of the rights\r\nof the western country. But the occasion also restricted me to the limits\r\nof a short text only, every word of which would be matter for copious\r\ncommentary, in a dilated discussion of the subject. Has Moreau de l'Isle's\r\nopinion ever been printed? I wish it were possible to get a copy of it.\r\nPerhaps I might be able to make good use of it.\r\n\r\nBefore the receipt of your letter of Jan. 12th, I had heard of your great\r\nloss, and been impressed with the depth of it. Long tried in the same\r\nschool of affliction, no loss which can rend the human heart is unknown to\r\nmine; and a like one particularly, at about the same period of life, had\r\ntaught me to feel the sympathies of yours. The same experience has proved\r\nthat time, silence and occupation are its only medicines. Of occupation,\r\nyou have enough and of the highest order; that of continuing to make a\r\nworthy people happy by a just and parental government, and of protecting\r\nthem from the wolves prowling around to devour them. Your own example\r\nwill be the best lesson for the son which has been left to comfort you,\r\nto whose course in life I hope it will give a shape which shall make him\r\ntruly a comfort and support to your latter days, protracted to your own\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nI really wish effect to the hints in my letter to you for so laying off\r\nthe additions to the city of New Orleans, as to shield it from yellow\r\nfever. My confidence in the idea is founded in the acknowledged experience\r\nthat we have never seen the _genuine_ yellow fever extend itself into the\r\ncountry, nor even to the outskirts or open parts of a close-built city. In\r\nthe plan I propose, every square would be surrounded, on every side, by\r\nopen and pure air, and would, in fact, be a separate town with fields or\r\nopen suburbs around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. HUGH L. WHITE, THOMAS M'CORRY, JAMES CAMPBELL, ROBERT\r\nCRAIGHEAD, JOHN N. GAMBLE, TRUSTEES FOR THE LOTTERY OF EAST TENNESSEE\r\nCOLLEGE.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 6, 1810.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I received, some time ago, your letter of February 28th,\r\ncovering a printed scheme of a lottery for the benefit of the East\r\nTennessee College, and proposing to send tickets to me to be disposed\r\nof. It would be impossible for them to come to a more inefficient hand.\r\nI rarely go from home, and consequently see but a few neighbors and\r\nfriends, who occasionally call on me. And having myself made it a rule\r\nnever to engage in a lottery or any other adventure of mere chance, I\r\ncan, with the less candor or effect, urge it on others, however laudable\r\nor desirable its object may be. No one more sincerely wishes the spread\r\nof information among mankind than I do, and none has greater confidence\r\nin its effect towards supporting free and good government. I am sincerely\r\nrejoiced, therefore, to find that so excellent a fund has been provided\r\nfor this noble purpose in Tennessee. Fifty-thousand dollars placed in a\r\nsafe bank, will give four thousand dollars a year, and even without other\r\naid, must soon accomplish buildings sufficient for the object in its\r\nearly stage. I consider the common plan followed in this country, but not\r\nin others, of making one large and expensive building, as unfortunately\r\nerroneous. It is infinitely better to erect a small and separate lodge\r\nfor each separate professorship, with only a hall below for his class,\r\nand two chambers above for himself; joining these lodges by barracks for\r\na certain portion of the students, opening into a covered way to give a\r\ndry communication between all the schools. The whole of these arranged\r\naround an open square of grass and trees, would make it, what it should\r\nbe in fact, an academical village, instead of a large and common den of\r\nnoise, of filth and of fetid air. It would afford that quiet retirement so\r\nfriendly to study, and lessen the dangers of fire, infection and tumult.\r\nEvery professor would be the police officer of the students adjacent to\r\nhis own lodge, which should include those of his own class of preference,\r\nand might be at the head of their table, if, as I suppose, it can be\r\nreconciled with the necessary economy to dine them in smaller and separate\r\nparties, rather than in a large and common mess. These separate buildings,\r\ntoo, might be erected successively and occasionally, as the number of\r\nprofessorships and students should be increased, or the funds become\r\ncompetent.\r\n\r\nI pray you to pardon me if I have stepped aside into the province of\r\ncounsel; but much observation and reflection on these institutions have\r\nlong convinced me that the large and crowded buildings in which youths are\r\npent up, are equally unfriendly to health, to study, to manners, morals\r\nand order; and, believing the plan I suggest to be more promotive of\r\nthese, and peculiarly adapted to the slender beginnings and progressive\r\ngrowth of our institutions, I hoped you would pardon the presumption,\r\nin consideration of the motive which was suggested by the difficulty\r\nexpressed in your letter, of procuring funds for erecting the building.\r\nBut, on whatever plan you proceed, I wish it every possible success, and\r\nto yourselves the reward of esteem, respect and gratitude due to those who\r\ndevote their time and efforts to render the youths of every successive age\r\nfit governors for the next. To these accept, in addition, the assurances\r\nof mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 13, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for your promised attention to my portion of the\r\nMerinos, and if there be any expenses of transportation, &c., and you\r\nwill be so good as to advance my portion of them with yours and notify the\r\namount, it shall be promptly remitted. What shall we do with them? I have\r\nbeen so disgusted with the scandalous extortions lately practised in the\r\nsale of these animals, and with the description of patriotism and praise\r\nto the sellers, as if the thousands of dollars apiece they have not been\r\nashamed to receive were not reward enough, that I am disposed to consider\r\nas right, whatever is the reverse of what they have done. Since fortune\r\nhas put the occasion upon us, is it not incumbent upon us so to dispense\r\nthis benefit to the farmers of our country, as to put to shame those who,\r\nforgetting their own wealth and the honest simplicity of the farmers, have\r\nthought them fit objects of the shaving art, and to excite, by a better\r\nexample, the condemnation due to theirs? No sentiment is more acknowledged\r\nin the family of Agriculturists than that the few who can afford it should\r\nincur the risk and expense of all new improvements, and give the benefit\r\nfreely to the many of more restricted circumstances. The question then\r\nrecurs, What are we to do with them? I shall be willing to concur with\r\nyou in any plan you shall approve, and in order that we may have some\r\nproposition to begin upon, I will throw out a first idea, to be modified\r\nor postponed to whatever you shall think better.\r\n\r\nGive all the full-blooded males we can raise to the different counties\r\nof our State, one to each, as fast as we can furnish them. And as there\r\nmust be some rule of priority for the distribution, let us begin with our\r\nown counties, which are contiguous and nearly central to the State, and\r\nproceed, circle after circle, till we have given a ram to every county.\r\nThis will take about seven years, if we add to the full descendants those\r\nwhich will have past to the fourth generation from common ewes, to make\r\nthe benefit of a single male as general as practicable to the county,\r\nwe may ask some known character in each county to have a small society\r\nformed which shall receive the animal and prescribe rules for his care\r\nand government. We should retain ourselves all the full-blooded ewes, that\r\nthey may enable us the sooner to furnish a male to every county. When all\r\nshall have been provided with rams, we may, in a year or two more, be in a\r\ncondition to give an ewe also to every county, if it be thought necessary.\r\nBut I suppose it will not, as four generations from their full-blooded ram\r\nwill give them the pure race from common ewes.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we shall not be without a profit indemnifying our trouble\r\nand expense. For if of our present stock of common ewes, we place with\r\nthe ram as many as he may be competent to, suppose fifty, we may sell the\r\nmale lambs of every year for such reasonable price as, in addition to the\r\nwool, will pay for the maintenance of the flock. The first year they will\r\nbe half bloods, the second three-quarters, the third seven-eights, and\r\nthe fourth full-blooded, if we take care in selling annually half the ewes\r\nalso, to keep those of highest blood, this will be a fund for kindnesses\r\nto our friends, as well as for indemnification to ourselves; and our\r\nwhole State may thus, from this small stock, so dispersed, be filled in\r\na very few years with this valuable race, and more satisfaction result\r\nto ourselves than money ever administered to the bosom of a shaver. There\r\nwill be danger that what is here proposed, though but an act of ordinary\r\nduty, may be perverted into one of ostentation, but malice will always\r\nfind bad motives for good actions. Shall we therefore never do good? It\r\nmay also be used to commit us with those on whose example it will truly\r\nbe a reproof. We may guard against this perhaps by a proper reserve,\r\ndeveloping our purpose only by its execution.\r\n\r\n       Vive, vale, et siquid novisti rectius istis\r\n      Candidus imperti sinon, his ulere mecum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR TYLER.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 26, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your friendly letter of the 12th has been duly received.\r\nAlthough I have laid it down as a law to myself, never to embarrass the\r\nPresident with my solicitations, and have not till now broken through\r\nit, yet I have made a part of your letter the subject of one to him, and\r\nhave done it with all my heart, and in the full belief that I serve him\r\nand the public in urging that appointment. We have long enough suffered\r\nunder the base prostitution of law to party passions in one judge, and the\r\nimbecility of another. In the hands of one the law is nothing more than an\r\nambiguous text, to be explained by his sophistry into any meaning which\r\nmay subserve his personal malice. Nor can any milk-and-water associate\r\nmaintain his own dependence, and by a firm pursuance of what the law\r\nreally is, extend its protection to the citizens or the public. I believe\r\nyou will do it, and where you cannot induce your colleague to do what is\r\nright, you will be firm enough to hinder him from doing what is wrong, and\r\nby opposing sense to sophistry, leave the juries free to follow their own\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nI have long lamented with you the depreciation of law science. The\r\nopinion seems to be that Blackstone is to us what the Alcoran is to\r\nthe Mahometans, that everything which is necessary is in him, and what\r\nis not in him is not necessary. I still lend my counsel and books to\r\nsuch young students as will fix themselves in the neighborhood. Coke's\r\ninstitutes and reports are their first, and Blackstone their last book,\r\nafter an intermediate course of two or three years. It is nothing more\r\nthan an elegant digest of what they will then have acquired from the\r\nreal fountains of the law. Now men are born scholars, lawyers, doctors;\r\nin our day this was confined to poets. You wish to see me again in the\r\nlegislature, but this is impossible; my mind is now so dissolved in\r\ntranquillity, that it can never again encounter a contentious assembly;\r\nthe habits of thinking and speaking off-hand, after a disuse of five and\r\ntwenty years, have given place to the slower process of the pen. I have\r\nindeed two great measures at heart, without which no republic can maintain\r\nitself in strength. 1. That of general education, to enable every man to\r\njudge for himself what will secure or endanger his freedom. 2. To divide\r\nevery county into hundreds, of such size that all the children of each\r\nwill be within reach of a central school in it. But this division looks\r\nto many other fundamental provisions. Every hundred, besides a school,\r\nshould have a justice of the peace, a constable and a captain of militia.\r\nThese officers, or some others within the hundred, should be a corporation\r\nto manage all its concerns, to take care of its roads, its poor, and its\r\npolice by patroles, &c., (as the select men of the Eastern townships.)\r\nEvery hundred should elect one or two jurors to serve where requisite,\r\nand all other elections should be made in the hundreds separately, and\r\nthe votes of all the hundreds be brought together. Our present Captaincies\r\nmight be declared hundreds for the present, with a power to the courts to\r\nalter them occasionally. These little republics would be the main strength\r\nof the great one. We owe to them the vigor given to our revolution in\r\nits commencement in the Eastern States, and by them the Eastern States\r\nwere enabled to repeal the embargo in opposition to the Middle, Southern\r\nand Western States, and their large and lubberly division into counties\r\nwhich can never be assembled. General orders are given out from a centre\r\nto the foreman of every hundred, as to the sergeants of an army, and the\r\nwhole nation is thrown into energetic action, in the same direction in\r\none instant and as one man, and becomes absolutely irresistible. Could\r\nI once see this I should consider it as the dawn of the salvation of\r\nthe republic, and say with old Simeon, \"nune dimittas Domine.\" But our\r\nchildren will be as wise as we are, and will establish in the fulness\r\nof time those things not yet ripe for establishment. So be it, and to\r\nyourself health, happiness and long life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY, COUNT PAHLEN, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY AND MINISTER\r\nPLENIPOTENTIARY OF RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 13, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have been honored with your letter of the 25th ult., and have to\r\nreturn you my thanks for those of Madame de Tessé and General Lafayette,\r\nand for the print of Baron Humboldt, all of which are come safely to\r\nhand, and present to me the proofs and recollections of their much-valued\r\nfriendships. To these acknowledgments, permit me to add my congratulations\r\non your safe arrival in the United States, after journeys and voyages\r\nwhich, from their length, cannot have been pleasant. If, after this, it\r\nshall be found that a change of twenty degrees of latitude shall have\r\nno unfavorable influence on your health, it will furnish double cause of\r\nfelicitation.\r\n\r\nI am much flattered by the kind notice of the Emperor, which you have\r\nbeen so obliging as to communicate to me. The approbation of the good is\r\nalways consoling; but that of a sovereign whose station and endowments are\r\nso pre-eminent, is received with the sensibility which the veneration for\r\nhis character inspires. Among other motives of commiseration which the\r\ncalamities of Europe cannot fail to excite in every virtuous mind, the\r\ninterruption which these have given to the benevolent views of the Emperor\r\nis prominent. The accession of a sovereign, with the dispositions and\r\nqualifications to improve the condition of a great nation, and to place\r\nits happiness on a permanent basis, is a phenomenon so rare in the annals\r\nof mankind, that, when the blessing occurs, it is lamentable that any\r\nportion of it should be usurped by occurrences of the character of those\r\nwe have seen. If, separated from these scenes by an ocean of a thousand\r\nleagues breadth, they have required all our cares to keep aloof from their\r\ndesolating effects, I can readily conceive how much more they must occupy\r\nthose to whose territories they are contiguous.\r\n\r\nThat the Emperor may be able, whenever a pacification takes place, to show\r\nhimself the father and friend of the human race, to restore to nations the\r\nmoral laws which have governed their intercourse, and to prevent, forever,\r\na repetition of those ravages by sea and land, which will distinguish the\r\npresent as an age of Vandalism, I sincerely pray.\r\n\r\nI consider as a happy augury, the choice which the Emperor has made of a\r\nperson to reside near our government, so distinguished by his dispositions\r\nand qualifications to cherish the friendship and the interests of both\r\nnations. With my best wishes that your residence among us may be rendered\r\nentirely agreeable, and be accompanied with the blessing of health, accept\r\nthe assurances of my great respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BOTTA.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 15, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with your letter of the 12th of January, and although\r\nthe work you therein mention is not yet come to hand, I avail myself of\r\nan occasion, now rendered rare and precarious between our two countries,\r\nof anticipating the obligation I shall owe for the pleasure I shall have\r\nin perusing it, and of travelling over with you the important scenes,\r\n_quorum pars minima fui_, scenes which have given an impulsion to the\r\nworld, which, as to ourselves, has been a great blessing, but whether to\r\nEurope or not, can only be estimated by him who sees the future as well\r\nas the present and past. We are certainly indebted to those who think our\r\nrevolution worthy of their pen, and who will do justice to our actions and\r\nmotives; and to yourself I have no doubt we shall owe this obligation, and\r\nI now make you my acknowledgments with confidence and pleasure. It will\r\nbe a worthy preface to the history of this age of revolutions, to be ended\r\nwe know not when nor how. I pray you to accept the assurances of my great\r\nrespect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LAMBERT.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 16, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--An indispensable piece of business which has occupied me for a\r\nmonth past, obliged me to suspend all correspondence during that time.\r\nThis must apologize for my late acknowledgment of your favor of May 19th,\r\nand for the tardy expression of my thanks for so much of the papers you\r\nenclosed as respected myself. The approbation of my political conduct by\r\nmy republican countrymen generally, is a pillow of sweet repose to me,\r\nundisturbed by the noise of the enemies to our form of government. The\r\npolitical sentiments expressed by your society are in the pure spirit of\r\nthe principles of our revolution; so long as these prevail, we are safe\r\nfrom everything which can assail us from without or within.\r\n\r\nYour several communications on the first meridian, have been regularly\r\nhanded to the Philosophical Society; not corresponding regularly with\r\nany of the members, I have received no information respecting them. I\r\nhave formerly observed to you that while I entertain no doubt of their\r\naccuracy, my own familiarity with the subject had been too long suspended,\r\nto enable me to render a critical opinion on them. My occupations here are\r\nalmost exclusively given to my farm and affairs. They furnish me exercise,\r\nhealth and amusement, and with the recreations of family and neighborly\r\nsociety, fill up most of my time, and give a tranquillity necessary to\r\nmy time of life. With my best wishes for your prosperity, accept the\r\nassurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 16, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL AND FRIEND,--Your favor of May the 31st was duly received,\r\nand I join in congratulations with you on the resurrection of republican\r\nprinciples in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and the hope that the\r\nprofessors of these principles will not again easily be driven off\r\ntheir ground. The federalists, during their short-lived ascendency, have\r\nnevertheless, by forcing us from the embargo, inflicted a wound on our\r\ninterests which can never be cured, and on our affections which will\r\nrequire time to cicatrize. I ascribe all this to one pseudo-republican,\r\nStory. He came on (in place of Crowningshield, I believe) and staid only\r\na few days; long enough, however, to get complete hold of Bacon, who,\r\ngiving in to his representations, became panic-struck, and communicated\r\nhis panic to his colleagues, and they to a majority of the sound members\r\nof Congress. They believed in the alternative of repeal or civil war,\r\nand produced the fatal measure of repeal. This is the immediate parent of\r\nall our present evils, and has reduced us to a low standing in the eyes\r\nof the world. I should think that even the federalists themselves must\r\nnow be made, by their feelings, sensible of their error. The wealth which\r\nthe embargo brought home safely, has now been thrown back into the laps\r\nof our enemies, and our navigation completely crushed, and by the unwise\r\nand unpatriotic conduct of those engaged in it. Should the orders prove\r\ngenuine, which are said to have been given against our fisheries, they too\r\nare gone; and if not true as yet, they will be true on the first breeze\r\nof success which England shall feel, for it has now been some years that\r\nI am perfectly satisfied her intentions have been to claim the ocean as\r\nher conquest, and prohibit any vessel from navigating it, but on such a\r\ntribute as may enable her to keep up such a standing navy as will maintain\r\nher dominion over it. She has hauled in, or let herself out, been bold\r\nor hesitating, according to occurrences, but has in no situation done\r\nanything which might amount to a relinquishment of her intentions. I\r\nhave ever been anxious to avoid a war with England, unless forced by a\r\nsituation more losing than war itself. But I did believe we could coerce\r\nher to justice by peaceable means, and the embargo, evaded as it was,\r\nproved it would have coerced her had it been honestly executed. The proof\r\nshe exhibited on that occasion, that she can exercise such an influence in\r\nthis country as to control the will of its government and three-fourths\r\nof its people, and oblige the three-fourths to submit to one-fourth,\r\nis to me the most mortifying circumstance which has occurred since the\r\nestablishment of our government. The only prospect I see of lessening\r\nthat influence, is in her own conduct, and not from anything in our power.\r\nRadically hostile to our navigation and commerce, and fearing its rivalry,\r\nshe will completely crush it, and force us to resort to agriculture, not\r\naware that we shall resort to manufactures also, and render her conquests\r\nover our navigation and commerce useless, at least, if not injurious to\r\nherself in the end, and perhaps salutary to us, as removing out of our way\r\nthe chief causes and provocations to war.\r\n\r\nBut these are views which concern the present and future generation,\r\namong neither of which I count myself. You may live to see the change in\r\nour pursuits, and chiefly in those of your own State, which England will\r\neffect. I am not certain that the change on Massachusetts, by driving her\r\nto agriculture, manufactures and emigration, will lessen her happiness.\r\nBut once more to be done with politics. How does Mrs. Dearborne do? How do\r\nyou both like your situation? Do you amuse yourself with a garden, a farm,\r\nor what? That your pursuits, whatever they be, may make you both easy,\r\nhealthy and happy, is the prayer of your sincere friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE COOPER.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 6, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The tardiness of acknowledging the receipt of your favor of May\r\n10th will I fear induce a presumption that I have been negligent of its\r\ncontents, but I assure you I lost not a moment in endeavoring to fulfil\r\nyour wishes in procuring a good geological correspondent in this State.\r\nI could not offer myself, because of all the branches of science it was\r\nthe one I had the least cultivated. Our researches into the texture of\r\nour globe could be but so superficial, compared with its vast interior\r\nconstruction, that I saw no safety of conclusion from the one, as to the\r\nother; and therefore have pointed my own attentions to other objects in\r\npreference, as far as a heavy load of business would permit me to attend\r\nto anything else. Looking about, therefore, among my countrymen for some\r\none who might answer your views, I fixed on Mr. Joseph C. Cabell, not\r\nlong since returned from France, where he had attended particularly to\r\nchemistry, and had also attended Mr. Maclure in some of his geological\r\nexpeditions, as best qualified. I wrote to him; unfortunately he was\r\nfrom home, and did not return till the latter end of July. I received his\r\nanswer since our last post only. A diffidence in his qualifications to be\r\nuseful to you, has induced him to decline the undertaking, having, as he\r\nassures me, paid no particular attention to that branch of science. I have\r\nin vain looked over our State for some other person who might contribute\r\nto your views. As yet I can think of nobody; and whatever may be the\r\nresult of further inquiry, I have thought I ought not longer to delay\r\ninforming you of my unsuccessful efforts so far. Should I be able to find\r\na subject worthy of your correspondence, I shall not fail to engage him in\r\nit, and to give you notice. I thank you for the case of Dempsy _v._ the\r\nInsurers, which I have read with great pleasure, and entire conviction.\r\nIndeed it is high time to withdraw all respect from courts acting under\r\nthe arbitrary orders of governments who avow a total disregard to those\r\nmoral rules which have hitherto been acknowledged by nations, and have\r\nserved to regulate and govern their intercourse. I should respect just\r\nas much the rules of conduct which governed Cartouche or Blackbeard, as\r\nthose now acted on by France or England. If your argument is defective\r\nin anything, it is in having paid to the antecedent decisions of the\r\nBritish courts of Admiralty, the respect of examining them on grounds of\r\nreason; and the not having rested the decision at once on the profligacy\r\nof those tribunals, and openly declared against permitting their sentences\r\nto be ever more quoted or listened to until those nations return to the\r\npractice of justice, to an acknowledgment that there is a moral law which\r\nought to govern mankind, and by sufficient evidences of contrition for\r\ntheir present flagitiousness, make it safe to receive them again into the\r\nsociety of civilized nations. I hope this will still be done on a proper\r\noccasion. Yet knowing that religion does not furnish grosser bigots than\r\nlaw, I expect little from old judges. Those now at the bar may be bold\r\nenough to follow reason rather than precedent and may bring that principle\r\non the bench when promoted to it; but I fear this effort is not for my\r\nday. It has been said that when Harvey discovered the circulation of the\r\nblood, there was not a physician of Europe of forty years of age, who\r\never assented to it. I fear you will experience Harvey's fate. But it\r\nwill become law when the present judges are dead. Wishing you health and\r\nhappiness at all times, accept the assurances of my constant and great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of July 16th has been duly received, with the paper\r\nit enclosed, for which accept my thanks, and especially for the kind\r\nsentiments expressed towards myself. These testimonies of approbation,\r\nand friendly remembrance, are the highest gratifications I can receive\r\nfrom any, and especially from those in whose principles and zeal for\r\nthe public good I have confidence. Of that confidence in yourself the\r\nmilitary appointment to which you allude was sufficient proof, as it was\r\nmade, not on the recommendations of others, but on our own knowledge\r\nof your principles and qualifications. While I cherish with feeling\r\nthe recollections of my friends, I banish from my mind all political\r\nanimosities which might disturb its tranquillity, or the happiness\r\nI derive from my present pursuits. I have thought it among the most\r\nfortunate circumstances of my late administration that, during its\r\neight years continuance, it was conducted with a cordiality and harmony\r\namong all the members, which never were ruffled on any, the greatest\r\nor smallest occasion. I left my brethren with sentiments of sincere\r\naffection and friendship, so rooted in the uniform tenor of a long and\r\nintimate intercourse, that the evidence of my own senses alone ought to be\r\npermitted to shake them. Anxious, in my retirement, to enjoy undisturbed\r\nrepose, my knowledge of my successor and late coadjutors, and my entire\r\nconfidence in their wisdom and integrity, were assurances to me that I\r\nmight sleep in security with such watchmen at the helm, and that whatever\r\ndifficulties and dangers should assail our course, they would do what\r\ncould be done to avoid or surmount them. In this confidence I envelope\r\nmyself, and hope to slumber on to my last sleep. And should difficulties\r\noccur which they cannot avert, if we follow them in phalanx, we shall\r\nsurmount them without danger.\r\n\r\nI have been long intending to write to you as one of the associated\r\ncompany for printing useful works.\r\n\r\nOur laws, language, religion, politics and manners are so deeply laid in\r\nEnglish foundations, that we shall never cease to consider their history\r\nas a part of ours, and to study ours in that as its origin. Every one\r\nknows that judicious matter and charms of style have rendered Hume's\r\nhistory the manual of every student. I remember well the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich I devoured it when young, and the length of time, the research and\r\nreflection which were necessary to eradicate the poison it had instilled\r\ninto my mind. It was unfortunate that he first took up the history of\r\nthe Stuarts, became their apologist, and advocated all their enormities.\r\nTo support his work, when done, he went back to the Tudors, and so\r\nselected and arranged the materials of their history as to present their\r\narbitrary acts only, as the genuine samples of the constitutional power\r\nof the crown, and, still writing backwards, he then reverted to the early\r\nhistory, and wrote the Saxon and Norman periods with the same perverted\r\nview. Although all this is known, he still continues to be put into the\r\nhands of all our young people, and to infect them with the poison of his\r\nown principles of government. It is this book which has undermined the\r\nfree principles of the English government, has persuaded readers of all\r\nclasses that these were usurpations on the legitimate and salutary rights\r\nof the crown, and has spread universal toryism over the land. And the\r\nbook will still continue to be read here as well as there. Baxter, one\r\nof Horne Tooke's associates in persecution, has hit on the only remedy\r\nthe evil admits. He has taken Hume's work, corrected in the text his\r\nmisrepresentations, supplied the truths which he suppressed, and yet has\r\ngiven the mass of the work in Hume's own words. And it is wonderful how\r\nlittle interpolation has been necessary to make it a sound history, and\r\nto justify what should have been its title, to wit, \"Hume's history of\r\nEngland abridged and rendered faithful to fact and principle.\" I cannot\r\nsay that his amendments are either in matter or manner in the fine style\r\nof Hume. Yet they are often unperceived, and occupy so little of the whole\r\nwork as not to depreciate it. Unfortunately he has _abridged_ Hume, by\r\nleaving out all the less important details. It is thus reduced to about\r\none half its original size. He has also continued the history, but very\r\nsummarily, to 1801. The whole work is of 834 quarto pages, printed close,\r\nof which the continuation occupies 283. I have read but little of this\r\npart. As far as I can judge from that little, it is a mere chronicle,\r\noffering nothing profound. This work is so unpopular, so distasteful to\r\nthe present Tory palates and principles of England, that I believe it\r\nhas never reached a second edition. I have often inquired for it in our\r\nbook shops, but never could find a copy in them, and I think it possible\r\nthe one I imported may be the only one in America. Can we not have it\r\nre-printed here? It would be about four volumes 8vo.\r\n\r\nI have another enterprise to propose for some good printer. I have in my\r\npossession a MS. work in French, confided to me by a friend, whose name\r\nalone would give it celebrity were it permitted to be mentioned. But\r\nconsiderations insuperable forbid that. It is a Commentary and Review of\r\nMontesquieu's Spirit of Laws. The history of that work is well known.\r\nHe had been a great reader, and had commonplaced everything he read.\r\nAt length he wished to undertake some work into which he could bring\r\nhis whole commonplace book in a digested form. He fixed on the subject\r\nof his Spirit of Laws, and wrote the book. He consulted his friend\r\nHelvetius about publishing it, who strongly dissuaded it. He published it,\r\nhowever, and the world did not confirm Helvetius' opinion. Still, every\r\nman who reflects as he reads, has considered it as a book of paradoxes;\r\nhaving, indeed, much of truth and sound principle, but abounding also\r\nwith inconsistencies, apochryphal facts and false inferences. It is a\r\ncorrection of these which has been executed in the work I mention, by way\r\nof commentary and review; not by criticising words or sentences, but by\r\ntaking a book at a time, considering its general scope, and proceeding\r\nto confirm or confute it. And much of confutation there is, and of\r\nsubstitution of true for false principle, and the true principle is ever\r\nthat of republicanism. I will not venture to say that every sentiment in\r\nthe book will be approved, because, being in manuscript, and the French\r\ncharacters, I have not read the whole, but so much only as might enable\r\nme to estimate the soundness of the author's way of viewing his subject;\r\nand, judging from that which I have read, I infer with confidence that\r\nwe shall find the work generally worthy of our high approbation, and that\r\nit everywhere maintains the preëminence of representative government, by\r\nshowing that its foundations are laid in reason, in right, and in general\r\ngood. I had expected this from my knowledge of the other writings of the\r\nauthor, which have always a precision rarely to be met with. But to give\r\nyou an idea of the manner of its execution, I translate and enclose his\r\ncommentary on Montesquieu's eleventh book, which contains the division\r\nof the work. I wish I could have added his review at the close of the\r\ntwelve first books, as this would give a more complete idea of the\r\nextraordinary merit of the work. But it is too long to be copied. I add\r\nfrom it, however, a few extracts of his reviews of some of the books, as\r\nspecimens of his plan and principles. If printed in French, it would be\r\nof about 180 pages 8vo, or 23 sheets. If any one will undertake to have\r\nit translated and printed on their own account, I will send on the MS.\r\nby post, and they can take the copyright as of an original work, which it\r\nought to be understood to be. I am anxious it should be ably translated by\r\nsome one who possesses style as well as capacity to do justice to abstruse\r\nconceptions. I would even undertake to revise the translation if required.\r\nThe original sheets must be returned to me, and I should wish the work to\r\nbe executed with as little delay as possible.\r\n\r\nI close this long letter with assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 16, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of July 14th, with the welcome paper it covered, has\r\nbeen most thankfully received. I had before received from your office\r\nand that of State, all the printed publications on the subject of the\r\nbatture, that is to say, the opinion of the Philadelphia lawyers and of G.\r\nLivingston himself, the publications of Derbigny, Thierry, Poydras, and\r\nthe _pièces probantes_. I had been very anxious to get Moreau's memoire,\r\nwhich is only in manuscript, having heard it was the best of all. After\r\nwaiting long and in vain for it, I was informed by my counsel that they\r\nwere ruled to plead, and must be furnished with the grounds of defence. I\r\nwas obliged, therefore, to take up the subject--had got through it and put\r\nit into the hands of Mr. Hay, when the observations you were so kind as\r\nto furnish, came to hand. Although it was too late to give to everything\r\nits shape which these, at an earlier stage, might have suggested, I\r\nwas still enabled to avail myself of them usefully. The question of the\r\nchancery jurisdiction of the Orleans judges had particularly escaped me,\r\nand entirely. When Mr. Hay returned the paper therefore, I was enabled, by\r\nre-copying a sheet or two at the close, to introduce this question in its\r\nproper place. I had also, till then, been uninformed of the circumstances\r\nunder which Bertrand Gravier left France, and therefore had not been aware\r\nof the reasons for which John Gravier had chosen to come in by purchase.\r\nThis information enabled me to extend and strengthen much of what I had\r\nbefore said on that subject; and by interleaving and recopying a part, to\r\nget that also into its proper place. On the whole, you will see, with the\r\nbenefit of these amendments, what I had conceived to be a true statement\r\nof the fact and law of the case. But the paper is very voluminous, and I\r\ncould not shorten it. It is now in the hands of the President, who will\r\nenclose it to you by the same post which carries this; when you shall have\r\nperused it, be so good as to re-enclose it to me, as I wish to submit\r\nit to our other fellow-laborers, after such amendments as Mr. Madison\r\nand yourself will be so good as to suggest. I wish the ground I take to\r\nmeet all your approbations. The uninformed state in which the debates of\r\nthe last session proved Congress to be, as to this case, makes me fear\r\nthey may, at the next, under the intrigues and urgency of Livingston,\r\nbe induced to take some step which might have an injurious effect on\r\nthe opinion of a jury. I think, therefore, to ask a member or two of\r\neach house to read this statement, merely to make themselves masters\r\nof the subject, and be enabled to prevent any unfavorable interference\r\nof Congress. Perhaps, if they see the case in the light I do, they may\r\nthink of doing more--of having the Attorney General desired to attend to\r\nthe case as of public concern: for really it is so. I have no concern\r\nat all in maintaining the title to the batture. It would be totally\r\nunnecessary for me to employ counsel to go into the question at all for\r\nmy own defence. That is solidly built on the simple fact, that if I were\r\nin error, it was honest, and not imputable to that gross and palpable\r\ncorruption or injustice which makes a public magistrate responsible to a\r\nprivate party. I know that even a federal jury could not find a verdict\r\nagainst me on this head. But I go fully into the question of title,\r\nbecause our characters are concerned in it, and because it involves a most\r\nimportant right of the citizens, and one which, if decided against them,\r\nwould be a precedent of incalculable evil. The detention, too, has been\r\nso long the act of Congress itself, that for this reason I have supposed\r\nthey might think it entitled to their attention, and direct the Attorney\r\nGeneral to take care of the public interest in it, as has lately been done\r\nby the House of Commons, in the action of Sir Francis Burdett against\r\ntheir Speaker. But on this subject I wish to be advised by yourself and\r\nmy other friends, rather than trust to my own judgment, too likely to be\r\nunder bias. If I send the case to be perused by two or three members, it\r\nwill be under a strong injunction not to let its contents get into other\r\nhands, my counsel having strongly advised against apprizing them of the\r\ntopics of defence, as well from apprehensions of subornation of witnesses\r\nas to material facts, as from other considerations. Pray advise me on this\r\nhead. My counsel are Hay, Wist and Janewell.\r\n\r\nI have seen with infinite grief the set which is made at you in the public\r\npapers, and with the more as my name has been so much used in it. I hope\r\nwe both know one another too well to receive impression from circumstances\r\nof this kind. A twelve years' intimate and friendly intercourse must be\r\nbetter evidence to each of the dispositions of the other than the letters\r\nof foreign ministers to their courts, or tortured influences from facts\r\ntrue or false. I have too thorough a conviction of your cordial good will\r\ntowards me, and too strong a sense of the faithful and able assistance\r\nI received from you, to relinquish them on any evidence but of my own\r\nsenses. With entire faith in your assurance of these truths, I shall add\r\nthose only of my constant affection and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL WM. DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 16, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of August 17th arrived the day after I had left\r\nthis place on a visit to one I have near Lynchburg, from whence I am\r\nbut lately returned. The history of England you describe is precisely\r\nBaxter's, of which I wrote you; and if you compare him with Hume, you\r\nwill find the text preserved verbatim, with particular exceptions only.\r\nThe French work will accompany this letter. Since writing to you I have\r\ngone over the whole, and can assure you it is the most valuable political\r\nwork of the present age. In some details we all may differ from him or\r\nfrom one another, but the great mass of the work is highly sound. Its\r\ntitle would be \"A Commentary on Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws;\" perhaps\r\nthe words \"and Review\" might be inserted at the----. Helvetius' letter\r\non the same work should be annexed, if it can possibly be procured. It\r\nwas contained in a late edition of the works of Helvetius published by\r\nthe Abbé de la Roche. Probably that edition might be found. I never\r\nbefore heard of Williams' lectures on Montesquieu, but I am glad to\r\nhear of everything which reduces that author to his just level, as his\r\npredilection for monarchy, and the English monarchy in particular, has\r\ndone mischief everywhere, and here also, to a certain degree. With respect\r\nto the Notes on Virginia, I do contemplate some day the making additions\r\nand corrections to them; but I am inclined to take the benefit of my whole\r\nlife to make collections and observations, and let the editing them be\r\nposthumous. The anecdote respecting the paper put into my hands by Dr.\r\nFranklin has not been handed to you with entire correctness. I returned\r\nfrom France in December 1789, and in March following I went on to New\r\nYork to take the post assigned me in the new government. On my way through\r\nPhiladelphia I called on Dr. Franklin, who was then confined to his bed.\r\nAs the revolution had then begun, indeed was supposed to be closed by\r\nthe completion of a constitution, and he was anxious to know the part\r\nall his acquaintances had taken, he plied me with questions for an hour\r\nor two with a vivacity and earnestness which astonished me. When I had\r\nsatisfied his inquiries, I observed to him that I had heard, and with\r\ngreat pleasure, that he had began the history of his own life, and had\r\nbrought it down to the revolution, (for so I had heard while in Europe.)\r\n\"Not exactly so,\" said he, \"but I will let you see the manner in which\r\nI do these things.\" He then desired one of his small grand-children who\r\nhappened to be in the room, to bring him such a paper from the table. It\r\nwas brought, and he put it into my hands and said, \"there, put that into\r\nyour pocket and you will see the manner of my writing.\" I thanked him and\r\nsaid \"I should read it with great pleasure, and return it to him safely.\"\r\n\"No,\" said he, \"keep it.\" I took it with me to New York. It was, as well\r\nas I recollect, about a quire of paper, in which he had given, with great\r\nminuteness, all the details of his negotiations (informal) in England,\r\nto prevent their pushing us to extremities. These were chiefly through\r\nLord Howe and a lady, I think the sister of Lord Howe, but of this I am\r\nnot certain; but I remember noting the particulars of her conversation\r\nas marking her as a woman of very superior understanding. He gave all the\r\nconversations with her and Lord Howe, and all the propositions he passed\r\nthrough them to their minister, the answers and conversations with the\r\nminister reported through them, his endeavors used with other characters,\r\nwhether with the ministers directly I do not recollect; but I remember\r\nwell that it appeared distinctly from what was brought to him from the\r\nministers, that the real obstacle to their meeting the various overtures\r\nhe made was the prospect of great confiscations to provide for their\r\nfriends, and that this was the real cause of the various shiftings and\r\nshufflings they used to evade his propositions. Learning, on his death,\r\nwhich happened soon after, that he had bequeathed all his unpublished\r\nwritings to his grandson, W. T. Franklin, with a view to the emolument he\r\nmight derive from their publication, I thought this writing was fairly\r\nhis property, and notified to him my possession of it, and that I would\r\ndeliver it to his order. He soon afterwards called on me at New York,\r\nand I delivered it to him. He accepted it, and, while putting it into his\r\npocket, observed that his grandfather had retained another copy which he\r\nhad found among his papers. I did not reflect on this till suspicions\r\nwere circulated that W. T. F. had sold these writings to the British\r\nMinister. I then formed the belief that Dr. Franklin had meant to deposit\r\nthis spare copy with me in confidence that it would be properly taken\r\ncare of, and sincerely repented the having given it up; and I have little\r\ndoubt that this identical paper was the principal object of the purchase\r\nby the British government, and the unfortunate cause of the suppression\r\nof all the rest. I do not think I have any interesting papers or facts\r\nfrom Dr. Franklin. Should any occur at any time, I will communicate them\r\nfreely, nobody wishing more ardently that the public could be possessed\r\nof everything that was his or respected him, believing that a greater\r\nor better character has rarely existed. I am happy to learn that his\r\nblood shows itself in the veins of the two of his great grandchildren\r\nwhom you mention. But I should think medicine the best profession for\r\na genius resembling his, as that of the elder is supposed to do. I have\r\nreceived information of Pestalozzi's mode of education from some European\r\npublications, and from Mr. Keefe's book which shows that the latter\r\npossesses both the talents and the zeal for carrying it into effect. I\r\nsincerely wish it success, convinced that the information of the people at\r\nlarge can alone make them the safe, as they are the sole depository of our\r\npolitical and religious freedom. The idea of antimony in this neighborhood\r\nis, I believe, without foundation. Some twenty or thirty years ago a\r\nmineral was found about ten miles from this place, which one of those idle\r\nimpostors, who call themselves mine-hunters, persuaded the proprietor was\r\ngold ore. The poor man lost a crop in digging after it. After fruitless\r\nassays of the mineral, some other person, knowing as little of the matter,\r\nfancied it must be antimony. A third idea was that it was black lead. It\r\nwas abandoned, and the mine hole filled up, nor can we at this day hear of\r\nany piece of the mineral in possession of any one.\r\n\r\nYou say in your letter that you will send me the _proofs_ of the\r\ncommentary on Montesquieu for revisal. It is only the _translation_\r\nI should wish to revise. I feel myself answerable to the author for a\r\ncorrect publication of his ideas. The translated sheets may come by post\r\nas they are finished off; they shall be promptly returned, the originals\r\ncoming with them. Accept the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. B. COLVIN.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 20, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 14th has been duly received, and I have to thank\r\nyou for the many obliging things respecting myself which are said in\r\nit. If I have left in the breasts of my fellow citizens a sentiment of\r\nsatisfaction with my conduct in the transaction of their business, it will\r\nsoften the pillow of my repose through the residue of life.\r\n\r\nThe question you propose, whether circumstances do not sometimes occur,\r\nwhich make it a duty in officers of high trust, to assume authorities\r\nbeyond the law, is easy of solution in principle, but sometimes\r\nembarrassing in practice. A strict observance of the written laws is\r\ndoubtless _one_ of the high duties of a good citizen, but it is not _the\r\nhighest_. The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our\r\ncountry when in danger, are of higher obligation. To lose our country by\r\na scrupulous adherence to written law, would be to lose the law itself,\r\nwith life, liberty, property and all those who are enjoying them with us;\r\nthus absurdly sacrificing the end to the means. When, in the battle of\r\nGermantown, General Washington's army was annoyed from Chew's house, he\r\ndid not hesitate to plant his cannon against it, although the property of\r\na citizen. When he besieged Yorktown, he leveled the suburbs, feeling that\r\nthe laws of property must be postponed to the safety of the nation. While\r\nthe army was before York, the Governor of Virginia took horses, carriages,\r\nprovisions and even men by force, to enable that army to stay together\r\ntill it could master the public enemy; and he was justified. A ship at sea\r\nin distress for provisions, meets another having abundance, yet refusing\r\na supply; the law of self-preservation authorizes the distressed to take\r\na supply by force. In all these cases, the unwritten laws of necessity,\r\nof self-preservation, and of the public safety, control the written laws\r\nof _meum_ and _tuum_. Further to exemplify the principle, I will state\r\nan hypothetical case. Suppose it had been made known to the Executive of\r\nthe Union in the autumn of 1805, that we might have the Floridas for a\r\nreasonable sum, that that sum had not indeed been so appropriated by law,\r\nbut that Congress were to meet within three weeks, and might appropriate\r\nit on the first or second day of their session. Ought he, for so great an\r\nadvantage to his country, to have risked himself by transcending the law\r\nand making the purchase? The public advantage offered, in this supposed\r\ncase, was indeed immense; but a reverence for law, and the probability\r\nthat the advantage might still be _legally_ accomplished by a delay of\r\nonly three weeks, were powerful reasons against hazarding the act. But\r\nsuppose it foreseen that a John Randolph would find means to protract the\r\nproceeding on it by Congress, until the ensuing spring, by which time\r\nnew circumstances would change the mind of the other party. Ought the\r\nExecutive, in that case, and with that foreknowledge, to have secured\r\nthe good to his country, and to have trusted to their justice for the\r\ntransgression of the law? I think he ought, and that the act would have\r\nbeen approved. After the affair of the Chesapeake, we thought war a very\r\npossible result. Our magazines were illy provided with some necessary\r\narticles, nor had any appropriations been made for their purchase. We\r\nventured, however, to provide them, and to place our country in safety;\r\nand stating the case to Congress, they sanctioned the act.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to the conspiracy of Burr, and particularly to General\r\nWilkinson's situation in New Orleans. In judging this case, we are bound\r\nto consider the state of the information, correct and incorrect, which he\r\nthen possessed. He expected Burr and his band from above, a British fleet\r\nfrom below, and he knew there was a formidable conspiracy within the city.\r\nUnder these circumstances, was he justifiable, 1st, in seizing notorious\r\nconspirators? On this there can be but two opinions; one, of the guilty\r\nand their accomplices; the other, that of all honest men. 2d. In sending\r\nthem to the seat of government, when the written law gave them a right to\r\ntrial in the territory? The danger of their rescue, of their continuing\r\ntheir machinations, the tardiness and weakness of the law, apathy of\r\nthe judges, active patronage of the whole tribe of lawyers, unknown\r\ndisposition of the juries, an hourly expectation of the enemy, salvation\r\nof the city, and of the Union itself, which would have been convulsed to\r\nits centre, had that conspiracy succeeded; all these constituted a law of\r\nnecessity and self-preservation, and rendered the _salus populi_ supreme\r\nover the written law. The officer who is called to act on this superior\r\nground, does indeed risk himself on the justice of the controlling powers\r\nof the constitution, and his station makes it his duty to incur that risk.\r\nBut those controlling powers, and his fellow citizens generally, are bound\r\nto judge according to the circumstances under which he acted. They are not\r\nto transfer the information of this place or moment to the time and place\r\nof his action; but to put themselves into his situation. We knew here that\r\nthere never was danger of a British fleet from below, and that Burr's band\r\nwas crushed before it reached the Mississippi. But General Wilkinson's\r\ninformation was very different, and he could act on no other.\r\n\r\nFrom these examples and principles you may see what I think on the\r\nquestion proposed. They do not go to the case of persons charged with\r\npetty duties, where consequences are trifling, and time allowed for a\r\nlegal course, nor to authorize them to take such cases out of the written\r\nlaw. In these, the example of overleaping the law is of greater evil than\r\na strict adherence to its imperfect provisions. It is incumbent on those\r\nonly who accept of great charges, to risk themselves on great occasions,\r\nwhen the safety of the nation, or some of its very high interests are at\r\nstake. An officer is bound to obey orders; yet he would be a bad one who\r\nshould do it in cases for which they were not intended, and which involved\r\nthe most important consequences. The line of discrimination between cases\r\nmay be difficult; but the good officer is bound to draw it at his own\r\nperil, and throw himself on the justice of his country and the rectitude\r\nof his motives.\r\n\r\nI have indulged freer views on this question, on your assurances that\r\nthey are for your own eye only, and that they will not get into the\r\nhands of newswriters. I met their scurrilities without concern, while in\r\npursuit of the great interests with which I was charged. But in my present\r\nretirement, no duty forbids my wish for quiet.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 22, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have wanted the occasion of the present enclosure to perform\r\nthe duty of my thanks for the kind communication of papers from your\r\noffice in the question between Livingston and myself. These have mainly\r\nenabled me to give a correct statement of facts. I deferred proceeding\r\nto a particular consideration of the case in hopes of the aid of Moreau's\r\nMemoire, which I have understood to be the ablest which has been written.\r\nBut I was at length forced to proceed without it, my counsel informing me\r\nthey were ruled to plead, and must therefore know the grounds of defence.\r\nYou will see what I have made of it by the enclosed, which I forward in\r\nthe hope you will consider and correct it. I have done this the rather\r\nbecause I presume all my fellow laborers feel an interest in what all\r\napproved, and because I think I should urge nothing which they disapprove.\r\nWill you then do me the favor to put on paper such corrections as you\r\nwould advise, and forward them to me, handing on the enclosed paper at\r\nthe same time to Mr. Rodney? I wrote him by this post that he may expect\r\nit from you, and I ask the same favor of correction from him, and above\r\nall to delay as little as possible, because time presses to give to this\r\npaper its ultimate form. My counsel press me earnestly not to let the\r\ntopics of defence get out, so as to be known to the adversary. Although I\r\nknow Congress will be strongly urged, yet I hope they will take no measure\r\nwhich may impress a jury unfavorably, by inferences not intended. And were\r\nthe case to be thought to belong to the public, still I believe it better\r\nthey should let it come on, on the footing of a private action. I pray you\r\nto be assured of my constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\nSeptember 26th. Sent a P. S. verbatim, the same as that to Mr. Rodney.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 25, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to thank you for your kind letter of June 8th, and the\r\nsuggestions it furnished on the question whether Livingston could maintain\r\nan action in Richmond for a trespass committed in Orleans. This being\r\na question of common law, I leave it to my counsel so much more recent\r\nthan I am in that branch of law. I have undertaken to furnish them with\r\nthe grounds of my defence under the _lex loci_. I wished for the aid\r\nof Moreau's Memoire because it is understood to be the ablest of any.\r\nHowever, my counsel being ruled to plead, and pressing me for the grounds\r\nof defence, I proceeded to consider the case, meaning at first only an\r\noutline, but I got insensibly into the full discussion, which became very\r\nvoluminous, and the more so as it was necessary not only to enter all\r\nthe authorities at large in the text, because few possess them, but also\r\ntranslations of them, because all do not understand all the languages in\r\nwhich they are. Believing my late associates in the executive would feel\r\nan interest in the justification of a conduct in which all concurred,\r\nand also in the issue of it, I have thought it a duty to consult them as\r\nto the grounds to be taken, and to take none against their advice. My\r\nstatement has therefore been submitted to the President, Mr. Smith and\r\nMr. Gallatin, and will be forwarded to you by Mr. Smith as soon as he\r\nshall have read it. I have to request your consideration and corrections\r\nof it, and that you will be so good as to furnish them on a separate\r\npaper. I am obliged also to ask an immediate attention to them, because\r\ntime presses to give to this paper its ultimate shape, to plead, and\r\ncollect the evidence. Its early return to me therefore is urging. I do\r\nnot know whether my counsel (Hay, Wist and Tazewell) have pleaded to the\r\njurisdiction. * * * * * The death of Cushing is opportune, as it gives\r\nan opening for at length getting a republican majority on the supreme\r\nbench. Ten years has the anti-civism of that body been bidding defiance\r\nto the spirit of the whole nation, after they had manifested their will by\r\nreforming every other branch of the government. I trust the occasion will\r\nnot be lost; Bidwell's disgrace withdraws the ablest man of the section in\r\nwhich Cushing's successor must be named. The pure integrity, unimpeachable\r\nconduct, talents and republican firmness of Lincoln, leave him now, I\r\nthink, without a rival. He is thought not an able common lawyer. But there\r\nis not and never was an able one in the New England States. Their system\r\nis _sui generis_, in which the _common_ law is little attended to. Lincoln\r\nis one of the ablest in their system, and it is among them he is to\r\nexecute the great portion of his duties. Nothing is more material than to\r\ncomplete the reformation of the government by this appointment, which may\r\ntruly be said to be putting the keystone into the arch. In my statement of\r\nthe law of Livingston's case, I do not pretend to consider every argument\r\nas perfectly sound. I have, as is usual, availed myself of some views,\r\nwhich may have a weight with others which they have not with me. I have no\r\nright to assume infallibility, and I present them, therefore, _ut valcant\r\nubi possint_. Accept the assurances of my constant and affectionate\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nP. S., September 26. In my letter of yesterday, I have omitted to observe,\r\nwith respect to the arrangement of materials in the paper it speaks\r\nof, that it is not such as counsel would employ in pleading a cause. It\r\nwas determined by other considerations. I thought it very possible the\r\ncase might be dismissed out of court by a plea to the jurisdiction. I\r\ndetermined, on this event, to lay it before the public, either directly or\r\nthrough Congress. Respect for my associates, for myself, for our nation,\r\nwould not permit me to come forward, as a criminal under accusation, to\r\nplead and argue a cause. This was not my situation. This would naturally\r\nbe by way of narrative or statement of the facts in their order of\r\ntime, establishing these facts as they occur, and bringing forward the\r\nlaw arising on them, and pointing to the Executive the course he was\r\nto pursue. I supposed it more dignified to present it as a history and\r\nexplanation of what had taken place. It does not, indeed, in that form,\r\ndisplay the subject in one great whole, but it brings forward successively\r\na number of questions, solving themselves as they arise, and leaving no\r\none unexamined. And the mind, after travelling over the whole case, and\r\nfinding as it goes along that all has been considered and all is right,\r\nrests in that state of satisfaction which it is our object to produce.\r\nIn truth, I have never known a case which presented so many distinct\r\nquestions, having no dependence on one another, nor belonging even to the\r\nsame branches of jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 27, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 10th came safely to hand, and laid me under new\r\nobligations for the valuable observations it contained. The error of\r\ntwelve feet instead of seven, for the rise of the batture, really _sautoit\r\naux yeux_, and how I could have committed it at first, or passed it over\r\nafterwards without discovery, and having copied Pelletier's plan myself,\r\nis unaccountable. I have adopted also most of your other corrections.\r\nYou observe that the arguments proving the batture public, yet prove it\r\nof such a character that it could not be within the scope of the law of\r\nMarch 4th, against squatters. I should so adjudge myself; yet I observe\r\nmany opinions otherwise, and in defence against a spadassin, it is lawful\r\nto use all weapons. Besides, I have no pretensions to be exclusively the\r\njudge of what arguments are sound and what not. I give them, therefore,\r\nthat they may weigh with those who think they have weight and have a right\r\nto decide for themselves. That act of Congress, moreover, was evidently\r\nrespected, particularly in the order under which the removal was made.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the arrangement of materials in my statement, I know it\r\nis not such as counsel would employ in pleading such a cause; it is not\r\nsuch as I would have made myself in that character; it was determined by\r\nother considerations. I thought it possible the case might be dismissed\r\nout of court by a plea to the jurisdiction. I determined, on this event,\r\nto lay it before the public, either directly or through Congress. Respect\r\nfor my associates, for myself, for our nation, would not permit me to\r\ncome forward, as a criminal under accusation, to plead and argue a cause.\r\nThis was not my situation. I had only to state to my constituents a common\r\ntransaction. This would naturally be by way of narrative or statement of\r\nthe facts, in their order of time, establishing these facts as they occur,\r\nand bringing forward the law arising on them and pointing to the Executive\r\nthe course he was to pursue. I suppose it more self-respectful to present\r\nit as a history and explanation of what had taken place. It does not,\r\nindeed, in that form, display the subject in one great whole, but it\r\nbrings forward successively a number of questions, solving themselves as\r\nthey arise, and leaving no one unexamined. And the mind, after travelling\r\nover the whole case, and finding as it goes along that all has been\r\nconsidered, and all is right, rests in that state of satisfaction which\r\nit is our object to produce. In truth, I have never known a case which\r\npresented so many distinct questions, having no dependence on one another,\r\nnor belonging even to the same branches of jurisprudence. After all, I\r\noffer this as explanation, not justification of the order adopted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt length, then, we have a chance of getting a republican majority in the\r\nSupreme Judiciary. For ten years has that branch braved the spirit and\r\nwill of the nation, after the nation had manifested its will by a complete\r\nreform in every branch depending on them. The event is a fortunate one,\r\nand so timed as to be a God-send to me. I am sure its importance to the\r\nnation will be felt, and the occasion employed to complete the great\r\noperation they have so long been executing, by the appointment of a\r\ndecided republican, with nothing equivocal about him. But who will it\r\nbe? The misfortune of Bidwell removes an able man from the competition.\r\nCan any other bring equal qualifications to those of Lincoln? I know he\r\nwas not deemed a profound common lawyer; but was there ever a profound\r\ncommon lawyer known in any of the Eastern States? There never was, nor\r\nnever can be one from those States. The basis of their law is neither\r\ncommon nor civil; it is an original, if any compound can so be called.\r\nIts foundation seems to have been laid in the spirit and principles of\r\nJewish law, incorporated with some words and phrases of common law, and an\r\nabundance of notions of their own. This makes an _amalgam sui generis_,\r\nand it is well known that a man, first and thoroughly initiated into the\r\nprinciples of one system of law, can never become pure and sound in any\r\nother. Lord Mansfield was a splendid proof of this. Therefore, I say,\r\nthere never was, nor can be a profound common lawyer from those States.\r\nSullivan had the reputation of preëminence there as a common lawyer.\r\nBut we have his history of land titles, which gives us his measure. Mr.\r\nLincoln is, I believe, considered as learned in their laws as any one\r\nthey have. Federalists say that Parsons is better. But the criticalness\r\nof the present nomination puts him out of question. As the great mass of\r\nthe functions of the new judge are to be performed in his own district,\r\nLincoln will be most unexceptionable and acceptable there; and on the\r\nsupreme bench equal to any one who can be brought from thence; add to\r\nthis his integrity, political firmness and unimpeachable character, and\r\nI believe no one can be found to whom there will not be more serious\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\nYou seem to think it would be best to ascertain the probable result\r\nbefore making a proposition to Congress to defend Livingston's suit. On\r\nmature consideration I think it better that no such proposition should\r\nbe made. The debates there would fix the case as a party one, and we are\r\nthe minority in the judiciary department, and especially in the federal\r\nbranch of it here. Till Congress can be thoroughly put in possession of\r\nall the points in the case, it is best they should let it lie. Livingston,\r\nby removing it into the Judiciary, has fairly relinquished all claims\r\non their interference. I am confident that Congress will act soundly,\r\nwhenever we can give them a knowledge of the whole case. But I tire you\r\nwith this business, and end therefore with repeating assurances of my\r\nconstant attachment and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN ISAAC HILLARD.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 9, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I duly received your letter of September 10th, and return you\r\nthanks for that and the pamphlet you were so kind as to enclose me.\r\nThe health you enjoy at so good an old age, and the strength of mind\r\nevidenced in your pamphlet, are subjects of congratulation to yourself\r\nand of thankfulness to him who gives them. I am sorry that a professor of\r\nreligion should have given occasion for such a censure. It proves he has\r\nmuch to conquer in his own uncharitableness, and that it is not from him\r\nhis flock are to learn not to bear false witness against their neighbor.\r\nBut as to so much of his pulpit philippic as concerns myself I freely\r\nforgive him; for I feel no falsehood and fear no truth. That you may\r\nlong continue to enjoy health, happiness and a sound mind, is my sincere\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 13, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your third packet is received before the second had been\r\nreturned. It is now enclosed, and the other shall go by the next post.\r\nI find, as before, nothing to correct but those errors of the copyist\r\nwhich you would have corrected yourself before committed to the press. If\r\nit were practicable to send me the original sheets with the translated,\r\nperhaps my equal familiarity with both languages might enable me sometimes\r\nto be of some advantage; but I presume that might be difficult, and of\r\nlittle use, scarcely perhaps of any. I thank you for the copy of Williams.\r\nI have barely dipped into it a little. Enough, however, to see he is far\r\nshort of the luminous work you are printing. Indeed I think that the most\r\nvaluable work of the present age. I received from Williams, some years\r\nago, his book on the claims of authors. I found him to be a man of sound\r\nand true principles, but not knowing how to go at them, and not able to\r\ntrace or develop them for others. I believe with you that the crisis of\r\nEngland is come. What will be its issue it is vain to prophesy; so many\r\nthousand contingencies may turn up to affect its direction. Were I to\r\nhazard a guess, it would be that they will become a military despotism.\r\nTheir recollections of the portion of liberty they have enjoyed will\r\nrender force necessary to retain them under pure monarchy. Their pressure\r\nupon us has been so severe and so unprincipled, that we cannot deprecate\r\ntheir fate, though we might wish to see their naval power kept up to\r\nthe level of that of the other principal powers separately taken. But\r\nmay it not take a very different turn? Her paper credit annihilated, the\r\nprecious metals must become her circulating medium. The taxes which can\r\nbe levied on her people in these will be trifling in comparison with what\r\nthey could pay in paper money; her navy then will be unpaid, unclothed,\r\nunfed. Will such a body of men suffer themselves to be dismissed and to\r\nstarve? Will they not mutiny, revolt, embody themselves under a popular\r\nAdmiral, take possession of Western and Bermuda islands, and act on the\r\nAlgerine system? If they should not be able to act on this broad scale,\r\nthey will become individual pirates; and the modern Carthage will end as\r\nthe old one has done. I am sorry for her people, who are individually as\r\nrespectable as those of other nations--it is her government which is so\r\ncorrupt, and which has destroyed the nation--it was certainly the most\r\ncorrupt and unprincipled government on earth. I should be glad to see\r\ntheir farmers and mechanics come here, but I hope their nobles, priests,\r\nand merchants will be kept at home to be moralized by the discipline of\r\nthe new government. The young stripling whom you describe is, probably, as\r\nGeorge Nicholas used to say, \"in the plenitude of puppyism.\" Such coxcombs\r\ndo not serve even as straws to show which way the wind blows. Alexander\r\nis unquestionably a man of an excellent heart, and of very respectable\r\nstrength of mind; and he is the only sovereign who cordially loves us.\r\nBonaparte hates our government because it is a living libel on his. The\r\nEnglish hate us because they think our prosperity filched from theirs.\r\nOf Alexander's sense of the merits of our form of government, of its\r\nwholesome operation on the condition of the people, and of the interest he\r\ntakes in the success of our experiment, we possess the most unquestionable\r\nproofs; and to him we shall be indebted if the rights of neutrals, to\r\nbe settled whenever peace is made, shall be extended beyond the present\r\nbelligerents; that is to say, European neutrals, as George and Napoleon,\r\nof mutual consent and common hatred against us, would concur in excluding\r\nus. I thought it a salutary measure to engage the powerful patronage of\r\nAlexander at conferences for peace, at a time when Bonaparte was courting\r\nhim; and although circumstances have lessened its weight, yet it is\r\nprudent for us to cherish his good dispositions, as those alone which\r\nwill be exerted in our favor when that occasion shall occur. He, like\r\nourselves, sees and feels the atrociousness of both the belligerents. I\r\nsalute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES RONALDSON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, December 3, 1810.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I now return you the paper you were so kind as to enclose to me. The\r\nhint to the two belligerents of disarming each other of their auxiliaries,\r\nby opening asylums to them and giving them passages to this country,\r\nis certainly a good one. Bonaparte has mind enough to adopt it, but not\r\nthe means. England, again, has the means but not mind enough; she would\r\nprefer losing an advantage over her enemy to giving one to us. It is an\r\nunhappy state of mind for her, but I am afraid it is the true one. She\r\npresents a singular phenomenon of an honest people whose constitution,\r\nfrom its nature, must render their government forever dishonest; and\r\naccordingly, from the time that Sir Robert Walpole gave the constitution\r\nthat direction which its defects permitted, morality has been expunged\r\nfrom their political code. I think the paper might do good if published,\r\nand could do no harm. It cannot lessen our means of availing ourselves of\r\nthe same resource in case of our being at war with either belligerent. The\r\nonly difficulty in these cases (and in the revolutionary war we found it\r\na great one) is the conveying the invitation to the adverse troops. Accept\r\nmy salutations and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID HOWELL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 15, 1810.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Our last post brought me your friendly letter of November\r\n27th. I learn with pleasure that republican principles are predominant in\r\nyour State, because I conscientiously believe that governments founded\r\nin these are more friendly to the happiness of the people at large, and\r\nespecially of a people so capable of self-government as ours. I have been\r\never opposed to the party so falsely called federalists, because I believe\r\nthem desirous of introducing into our government authorities hereditary\r\nor otherwise independent of the national will. These always consume the\r\npublic contributions, and oppress the people with labor and poverty.\r\nNo one was more sensible than myself, while Governor Fenner was in the\r\nSenate, of the soundness of his political principles, and rectitude of his\r\nconduct. Among those of my fellow laborers of whom I had a distinguished\r\nopinion, he was one, and I have no doubt those among whom he lives, and\r\nwho have already given him so many proofs of their unequivocal confidence\r\nin him, will continue so to do. It would be impertinent in me, a stranger\r\nto them, to tell them what they all see daily. My object too, at present,\r\nis peace and tranquillity, neither doing nor saying anything to be quoted,\r\nor to make me the subject of newspaper disquisitions. I read one or two\r\nnewspapers a week, but with reluctance give even that time from Tacitus\r\nand Horace, and so much other more agreeable reading; indeed, I give more\r\ntime to exercise of the body than of the mind, believing it wholesome to\r\nboth. I enjoy, in recollection, my ancient friendships, and suffer no\r\nnew circumstances to mix alloy with them. I do not take the trouble of\r\nforming opinions on what is passing among them, because I have such entire\r\nconfidence in their integrity and wisdom as to be satisfied all is going\r\nright, and that every one is doing his best in the station confided to\r\nhim. Under these impressions, accept sincere assurances of my continued\r\nesteem and respect for yourself personally, and my best wishes for your\r\nhealth and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LAW.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 15, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--An absence from home of some length has prevented my sooner\r\nacknowledging the receipt of your letter, covering the printed pamphlet,\r\nwhich the same absence has as yet prevented me from taking up, but which I\r\nknow I shall read with great pleasure. Your favor of December the 22d, is\r\nalso received.\r\n\r\nMr. Wagner's malignity, like that of the rest of his tribe of brother\r\nprinters, who deal out calumnies for federal readers, gives me no pain.\r\nWhen a printer cooks up a falsehood, it is as easy to put it into the\r\nmouth of a Mr. Fox, as of a smaller man, and safer into that of a dead\r\nthan a living one. Your sincere attachment to this country, as well as\r\nto your native one, was never doubted by me; and in that persuasion, I\r\nfelt myself free to express to you my genuine sentiments with respect\r\nto England. No man was more sensible than myself of the just value of\r\nthe friendship of that country. There are between us so many of those\r\ncircumstances which naturally produce and cement kind dispositions,\r\nthat if they could have forgiven our resistance to their usurpations,\r\nour connections might have been durable, and have insured duration to\r\nboth our governments. I wished, therefore, a cordial friendship with\r\nthem, and I spared no occasion of manifesting this in our correspondence\r\nand intercourse with them; not disguising, however, my desire of\r\nfriendship with their enemy also. During the administration of Mr.\r\nAddington, I thought I discovered some friendly symptoms on the part of\r\nthat government; at least, we received some marks of respect from the\r\nadministration, and some of regret at the wrongs we were suffering from\r\ntheir country. So, also, during the short interval of Mr. Fox's power.\r\nBut every other administration since our Revolution has been equally\r\nwanton in their injuries and insults, and have manifested equal hatred\r\nand aversion. Instead, too, of cultivating the government itself, whose\r\nprinciples are those of the great mass of the nation, they have adopted\r\nthe miserable policy of teazing and embarrassing it, by allying themselves\r\nwith a faction here, not a tenth of the people, noisy and unprincipled,\r\nand which never can come into power while republicanism is the spirit of\r\nthe nation, and that must continue to be so, until such a condensation of\r\npopulation shall have taken place as will require centuries. Whereas, the\r\ngood will of the government itself would give them, and immediately, every\r\nbenefit which reason or justice would permit it to give. With respect to\r\nmyself, I saw great reason to believe their ministers were weak enough\r\nto credit the newspaper trash about a supposed personal enmity in myself\r\ntowards England. This wretched party imputation was beneath the notice of\r\nwise men. England never did me a personal injury, other than in open war;\r\nand for numerous individuals there, I have great esteem and friendship.\r\nAnd I must have had a mind far below the duties of my station, to have\r\nfelt either national partialities or antipathies in conducting the affairs\r\nconfided to me. My affections were first for my own country, and then,\r\ngenerally, for all mankind; and nothing but minds placing themselves\r\nabove the passions, in the functionaries of this country, could have\r\npreserved us from the war to which their provocations have been constantly\r\nurging us. The war interests in England include a numerous and wealthy\r\npart of their population; and their influence is deemed worth courting\r\nby ministers wishing to keep their places. Continually endangered by a\r\npowerful opposition, they find it convenient to humor the popular passions\r\nat the expense of the public good. The shipping interest, commercial\r\ninterest, and their janizaries of the navy, all fattening on war, will\r\nnot be neglected by ministers of ordinary minds. Their tenure of office\r\nis so infirm that they dare not follow the dictates of wisdom, justice,\r\nand the well-calculated interests of their country. This vice in the\r\nEnglish constitution, renders a dependence on that government very unsafe.\r\nThe feelings of their King, too, fundamentally adverse to us, have added\r\nanother motive for unfriendliness in his ministers. This obstacle to\r\nfriendship, however, seems likely to be soon removed; and I verily believe\r\nthe successor will come in with fairer and wiser dispositions towards us;\r\nperhaps on that event their conduct may be changed. But what England is to\r\nbecome on the crush of her internal structure, now seeming to be begun, I\r\ncannot foresee. Her monied interest, created by her paper system, and now\r\nconstituting a baseless mass of wealth equal to that of the owners of the\r\nsoil, must disappear with that system, and the medium for paying great\r\ntaxes thus failing, her navy must be without support. That it shall be\r\nsupported by permitting her to claim dominion of the ocean, and to levy\r\ntribute on every flag traversing that, as lately attempted and not yet\r\nrelinquished, every nation must contest, even _ad internecionem_. And yet,\r\nthat retiring from this enormity, she should continue able to take a fair\r\nshare in the necessary equilibrium of power on that element, would be the\r\ndesire of every nation.\r\n\r\nI feel happy in withdrawing my mind from these anxieties, and resigning\r\nmyself, for the remnant of life, to the care and guardianship of others.\r\nGood wishes are all an old man has to offer to his country or friends.\r\nMine attend yourself, with sincere assurances of esteem and respect,\r\nwhich, however, I should be better pleased to tender you in person, should\r\nyour rambles ever lead you into the vicinage of Monticello.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 16, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had been considering for some days, whether it was not time\r\nby a letter, to bring myself to your recollection, when I received your\r\nwelcome favor of the 2d instant. I had before heard of the heart-rending\r\ncalamity you mention, and had sincerely sympathized with your afflictions.\r\nBut I had not made it the subject of a letter, because I knew that\r\ncondolences were but renewals of grief. Yet I thought, and still think,\r\nthis is one of the cases wherein we should \"not sorrow, even as others who\r\nhave no hope.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou ask if I have read Hartley? I have not. My present course of life\r\nadmits less reading than I wish. From breakfast, or noon at latest, to\r\ndinner, I am mostly on horseback, attending to my farm or other concerns,\r\nwhich I find healthful to my body, mind and affairs; and the few hours I\r\ncan pass in my cabinet, are devoured by correspondences; not those with my\r\nintimate friends, with whom I delight to interchange sentiments, but with\r\nothers, who, writing to me on concerns of their own in which I have had an\r\nagency, or from motives of mere respect and approbation, are entitled to\r\nbe answered with respect and a return of good will. My hope is that this\r\nobstacle to the delights of retirement, will wear away with the oblivion\r\nwhich follows that, and that I may at length be indulged in those studious\r\npursuits, from which nothing but revolutionary duties would ever have\r\ncalled me.\r\n\r\nI shall receive your proposed publication and read it with the pleasure\r\nwhich everything gives me from your pen. Although much of a sceptic in the\r\npractice of medicine, I read with pleasure its ingenious theories.\r\n\r\nI receive with sensibility your observations on the discontinuance of\r\nfriendly correspondence between Mr. Adams and myself, and the concern you\r\ntake in its restoration. This discontinuance has not proceeded from me,\r\nnor from the want of sincere desire and of effort on my part, to renew our\r\nintercourse. You know the perfect coincidence of principle and of action,\r\nin the early part of the Revolution, which produced a high degree of\r\nmutual respect and esteem between Mr. Adams and myself. Certainly no man\r\nwas ever truer than he was, in that day, to those principles of rational\r\nrepublicanism which, after the necessity of throwing off our monarchy,\r\ndictated all our efforts in the establishment of a new government. And\r\nalthough he swerved, afterwards, towards the principles of the English\r\nconstitution, our friendship did not abate on that account. While he\r\nwas Vice President, and I Secretary of State, I received a letter from\r\nPresident Washington, then at Mount Vernon, desiring me to call together\r\nthe Heads of departments, and to invite Mr. Adams to join us (which,\r\nby-the-bye, was the only instance of that being done) in order to\r\ndetermine on some measure which required despatch; and he desired me to\r\nact on it, as decided, without again recurring to him. I invited them to\r\ndine with me, and after dinner, sitting at our wine, having settled our\r\nquestion, other conversation came on, in which a collision of opinion\r\narose between Mr. Adams and Colonel Hamilton, on the merits of the\r\nBritish constitution, Mr. Adams giving it as his opinion, that, if some\r\nof its defects and abuses were corrected, it would be the most perfect\r\nconstitution of government ever devised by man. Hamilton, on the contrary,\r\nasserted, that with its existing vices, it was the most perfect model\r\nof government that could be formed; and that the correction of its vices\r\nwould render it an impracticable government. And this you may be assured\r\nwas the real line of difference between the political principles of these\r\ntwo gentlemen. Another incident took place on the same occasion, which\r\nwill further delineate Mr. Hamilton's political principles. The room being\r\nhung around with a collection of the portraits of remarkable men, among\r\nthem were those of Bacon, Newton and Locke, Hamilton asked me who they\r\nwere. I told him they were my trinity of the three greatest men the world\r\nhad ever produced, naming them. He paused for some time: \"the greatest\r\nman,\" said he, \"that ever lived, was Julius Cæsar.\" Mr. Adams was honest\r\nas a politician, as well as a man; Hamilton honest as a man, but, as a\r\npolitician, believing in the necessity of either force or corruption to\r\ngovern men.\r\n\r\nYou remember the machinery which the federalists played off, about that\r\ntime, to beat down the friends to the real principles of our constitution,\r\nto silence by terror every expression in their favor, to bring us into\r\nwar with France and alliance with England, and finally to homologize our\r\nconstitution with that of England. Mr. Adams, you know, was overwhelmed\r\nwith feverish addresses, dictated by the fear, and often by the pen, of\r\nthe _bloody buoy_, and was seduced by them into some open indications of\r\nhis new principles of government, and in fact, was so elated as to mix\r\nwith his kindness a little superciliousness towards me. Even Mrs. Adams,\r\nwith all her good sense and prudence, was sensibly flushed. And you\r\nrecollect the short suspension of our intercourse, and the circumstance\r\nwhich gave rise to it, which you were so good as to bring to an early\r\nexplanation, and have set to rights, to the cordial satisfaction of us\r\nall. The nation at length passed condemnation on the political principles\r\nof the federalists, by refusing to continue Mr. Adams in the Presidency.\r\nOn the day on which we learned in Philadelphia the vote of the city of\r\nNew York, which it was well known would decide the vote of the State, and\r\nthat, again, the vote of the Union, I called on Mr. Adams on some official\r\nbusiness. He was very sensibly affected, and accosted me with these words:\r\n\"Well, I understand that you are to beat me in this contest, and I will\r\nonly say that I will be as faithful a subject as any you will have.\"\r\n\"Mr. Adams,\" said I, \"this is no personal contest between you and me.\r\nTwo systems of principles on the subject of government divide our fellow\r\ncitizens into two parties. With one of these you concur, and I with the\r\nother. As we have been longer on the public stage than most of those now\r\nliving, our names happen to be more generally known. One of these parties,\r\ntherefore, has put your name at its head, the other mine. Were we both\r\nto die to-day, to-morrow two other names would be in the place of ours,\r\nwithout any change in the motion of the machinery. Its motion is from its\r\nprinciple, not from you or myself.\" \"I believe you are right,\" said he,\r\n\"that we are but passive instruments, and should not suffer this matter to\r\naffect our personal dispositions.\" But he did not long retain this just\r\nview of the subject. I have always believed that the thousand calumnies\r\nwhich the federalists, in bitterness of heart, and mortification at their\r\nejection, daily invented against me, were carried to him by their busy\r\nintriguers, and made some impression. When the election between Burr and\r\nmyself was kept in suspense by the federalists, and they were meditating\r\nto place the President of the Senate at the head of the government, I\r\ncalled on Mr. Adams with a view to have this desperate measure prevented\r\nby his negative. He grew warm in an instant, and said with a vehemence he\r\nhad not used towards me before, \"Sir, the event of the election is within\r\nyour own power. You have only to say you will do justice to the public\r\ncreditors, maintain the navy, and not disturb those holding offices, and\r\nthe government will instantly be put into your hands. We know it is the\r\nwish of the people it should be so.\" \"Mr. Adams,\" said I, \"I know not what\r\npart of my conduct, in either public or private life, can have authorized\r\na doubt of my fidelity to the public engagements. I say, however, I will\r\nnot come into the government by capitulation. I will not enter on it,\r\nbut in perfect freedom to follow the dictates of my own judgment.\" I\r\nhad before given the same answer to the same intimation from Gouverneur\r\nMorris. \"Then,\" said he, \"things must take their course.\" I turned the\r\nconversation to something else, and soon took my leave. It was the first\r\ntime in our lives we had ever parted with anything like dissatisfaction.\r\nAnd then followed those scenes of midnight appointment, which have been\r\ncondemned by all men. The last day of his political power, the last hours,\r\nand even beyond the midnight, were employed in filling all offices, and\r\nespecially permanent ones, with the bitterest federalists, and providing\r\nfor me the alternative, either to execute the government by my enemies,\r\nwhose study it would be to thwart and defeat all my measures, or to\r\nincur the odium of such numerous removals from office, as might bear me\r\ndown. A little time and reflection effaced in my mind this temporary\r\ndissatisfaction with Mr. Adams, and restored me to that just estimate\r\nof his virtues and passions, which a long acquaintance had enabled me to\r\nfix. And my first wish became that of making his retirement easy by any\r\nmeans in my power; for it was understood he was not rich. I suggested\r\nto some republican members of the delegation from his State, the giving\r\nhim, either directly or indirectly, an office, the most lucrative in\r\nthat State, and then offered to be resigned, if they thought he would\r\nnot deem it affrontive. They were of opinion he would take great offence\r\nat the offer; and moreover, that the body of republicans would consider\r\nsuch a step in the outset as arguing very ill of the course I meant to\r\npursue. I dropped the idea, therefore, but did not cease to wish for some\r\nopportunity of renewing our friendly understanding.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years after, having had the misfortune to lose a daughter,\r\nbetween whom and Mrs. Adams there had been a considerable attachment, she\r\nmade it the occasion of writing me a letter, in which, with the tenderest\r\nexpressions of concern at this event, she carefully avoided a single one\r\nof friendship towards myself, and even concluded it with the wishes \"of\r\nher who _once_ took pleasure in subscribing herself your friend, Abigail\r\nAdams.\" Unpromising as was the complexion of this letter, I determined\r\nto make an effort towards removing the cloud from between us. This\r\nbrought on a correspondence which I now enclose for your perusal, after\r\nwhich be so good as to return it to me, as I have never communicated it\r\nto any mortal breathing, before. I send it to you, to convince you I\r\nhave not been wanting either in the desire, or the endeavor to remove\r\nthis misunderstanding. Indeed, I thought it highly disgraceful to us\r\nboth, as indicating minds not sufficiently elevated to prevent a public\r\ncompetition from affecting our personal friendship. I soon found from\r\nthe correspondence that conciliation was desperate, and yielding to an\r\nintimation in her last letter, I ceased from further explanation. I have\r\nthe same good opinion of Mr. Adams which I ever had. I know him to be an\r\nhonest man, an able one with his pen, and he was a powerful advocate on\r\nthe floor of Congress. He has been alienated from me, by belief in the\r\nlying suggestions contrived for electioneering purposes, that I perhaps\r\nmixed in the activity and intrigues of the occasion. My most intimate\r\nfriends can testify that I was perfectly passive. They would sometimes,\r\nindeed, tell me what was going on; but no man ever heard me take part in\r\nsuch conversations; and none ever misrepresented Mr. Adams in my presence,\r\nwithout my asserting his just character. With very confidential persons\r\nI have doubtless disapproved of the principles and practices of his\r\nadministration. This was unavoidable. But never with those with whom it\r\ncould do him any injury. Decency would have required this conduct from me,\r\nif disposition had not; and I am satisfied Mr. Adams' conduct was equally\r\nhonorable towards me. But I think it part of his character to suspect\r\nfoul play in those of whom he is jealous, and not easily to relinquish his\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nI have gone, my dear friend, into these details, that you might know\r\neverything which had passed between us, might be fully possessed of the\r\nstate of facts and dispositions, and judge for yourself whether they\r\nadmit a revival of that friendly intercourse for which you are so kindly\r\nsolicitous. I shall certainly not be wanting in anything on my part which\r\nmay second your efforts, which will be the easier with me, inasmuch as I\r\ndo not entertain a sentiment of Mr. Adams, the expression of which could\r\ngive him reasonable offence. And I submit the whole to yourself, with\r\nthe assurance, that whatever be the issue, my friendship and respect for\r\nyourself will remain unaltered and unalterable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN LYNCH.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 21, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--You have asked my opinion on the proposition of Mrs. Mifflin, to\r\ntake measures for procuring, on the coast of Africa, an establishment to\r\nwhich the people of color of these States might, from time to time, be\r\ncolonized, under the auspices of different governments. Having long ago\r\nmade up my mind on this subject, I have no hesitation in saying that I\r\nhave ever thought it the most desirable measure which could be adopted,\r\nfor gradually drawing off this part of our population, most advantageously\r\nfor themselves as well as for us. Going from a country possessing all\r\nthe useful arts, they might be the means of transplanting them among the\r\ninhabitants of Africa, and would thus carry back to the country of their\r\norigin, the seeds of civilization which might render their sojournment and\r\nsufferings here a blessing in the end to that country.\r\n\r\nI received, in the first year of my coming into the administration of\r\nthe General Government, a letter from the Governor of Virginia, (Colonel\r\nMonroe,) consulting me, at the request of the Legislature of the State, on\r\nthe means of procuring some such asylum, to which these people might be\r\noccasionally sent. I proposed to him the establishment of Sierra Leone,\r\nto which a private company in England had already colonized a number\r\nof negroes, and particularly the fugitives from these States during the\r\nRevolutionary War; and at the same time suggested, if this could not be\r\nobtained, some of the Portuguese possessions in South America, as next\r\nmost desirable. The subsequent Legislature approving these ideas, I wrote,\r\nthe ensuing year, 1802, to Mr. King, our Minister in London, to endeavor\r\nto negotiate with the Sierra Leone company a reception of such of these\r\npeople as might be colonized thither. He opened a correspondence with Mr.\r\nWedderburne and Mr. Thornton, secretaries of the company, on the subject,\r\nand in 1803 I received through Mr. King the result, which was that the\r\ncolony was going on, but in a languishing condition; that the funds of the\r\ncompany were likely to fail, as they received no returns of profit to keep\r\nthem up; that they were therefore in treaty with their government to take\r\nthe establishment off their hands; but that in no event should they be\r\nwilling to receive more of these people from the United States, as it was\r\nexactly that portion of their settlers which had gone from hence, which,\r\nby their idleness and turbulence, had kept the settlement in constant\r\ndanger of dissolution, which could not have been prevented but for the aid\r\nof the Maroon negroes from the West Indies, who were more industrious and\r\norderly than the others, and supported the authority of the government\r\nand its laws. I think I learned afterwards that the British Government\r\nhad taken the colony into its own hands, and I believe it still exists.\r\nThe effort which I made with Portugal, to obtain an establishment for them\r\nwithin their claims in South America, proved also abortive.\r\n\r\nYou inquire further, whether I would use my endeavors to procure for\r\nsuch an establishment security against violence from other powers, and\r\nparticularly from France? Certainly, I shall be willing to do anything I\r\ncan to give it effect and safety. But I am but a private individual, and\r\ncould only use endeavors with private individuals; whereas, the National\r\nGovernment can address themselves at once to those of Europe to obtain\r\nthe desired security, and will unquestionably be ready to exert its\r\ninfluence with those nations for an object so benevolent in itself, and\r\nso important to a great portion of its constituents. Indeed, nothing is\r\nmore to be wished than that the United States would themselves undertake\r\nto make such an establishment on the coast of Africa. Exclusive of motives\r\nof humanity, the commercial advantages to be derived from it might repay\r\nall its expenses. But for this, the national mind is not yet prepared.\r\nIt may perhaps be doubted whether many of these people would voluntarily\r\nconsent to such an exchange of situation, and very certain that few of\r\nthose advanced to a certain age in habits of slavery, would be capable\r\nof self-government. This should not, however, discourage the experiment,\r\nnor the early trial of it; and the proposition should be made with all\r\nthe prudent cautions and attentions requisite to reconcile it to the\r\ninterests, the safety and the prejudices of all parties.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DESTUTT TRACY.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 26, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The length of time your favor of June the 12th, 1809 was on its\r\nway to me, and my absence from home the greater part of the autumn,\r\ndelayed very much the pleasure which awaited me of reading the packet\r\nwhich accompanied it. I cannot express to you the satisfaction which I\r\nreceived from its perusal. I had, with the world, deemed Montesquieu's\r\nwork of much merit; but saw in it, with every thinking man, so much of\r\nparadox, of false principle and misapplied fact, as to render its value\r\nequivocal on the whole. Williams and others had nibbled only at its\r\nerrors. A radical correction of them, therefore, was a great desideratum.\r\nThis want is now supplied, and with a depth of thought, precision of\r\nidea, of language and of logic, which will force conviction into every\r\nmind. I declare to you, Sir, in the spirit of truth and sincerity, that\r\nI consider it the most precious gift the present age has received. But\r\nwhat would it have been, had the author, or would the author, take up the\r\nwhole scheme of Montesquieu's work, and following the correct analysis he\r\nhas here developed, fill up all its parts according to his sound views\r\nof them? Montesquieu's celebrity would be but a small portion of that\r\nwhich would immortalize the author. And with whom? With the rational and\r\nhigh-minded spirits of the present and all future ages. With those whose\r\napprobation is both incitement and reward to virtue and ambition. Is then\r\nthe hope desperate? To what object can the occupation of his future life\r\nbe devoted so usefully to the world, so splendidly to himself? But I must\r\nleave to others who have higher claims on his attention, to press these\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nMy situation, far in the interior of the country, was not favorable to\r\nthe object of getting this work translated and printed. Philadelphia is\r\nthe least distant of the great towns of our States, where there exists\r\nany enterprise in this way; and it was not till the spring following\r\nthe receipt of your letter, that I obtained an arrangement for its\r\nexecution. The translation is just now completed. The sheets came to me\r\nby post, from time to time, for revisal; but not being accompanied by the\r\noriginal, I could not judge of verbal accuracies. I think, however, it\r\nis substantially correct, without being an adequate representation of the\r\nexcellences of the original; as indeed no translation can be. I found it\r\nimpossible to give it the appearance of an original composition in our\r\nlanguage. I therefore think it best to divert inquiries after the author\r\ntowards a quarter where he will not be found; and with this view, propose\r\nto prefix the prefatory epistle now enclosed. As soon as a copy of the\r\nwork can be had, I will send it to you by duplicate. The secret of the\r\nauthor will be faithfully preserved during his and my joint lives; and\r\nthose into whose hands my papers will fall at my death, will be equally\r\nworthy of confidence. When the death of the author, or his living consent\r\nshall permit the world to know their benefactor, both his and my papers\r\nwill furnish the evidence. In the meantime, the many important truths the\r\nwork so solidly establishes, will, I hope, make it the political rudiment\r\nof the young, and manual of our older citizens.\r\n\r\nOne of its doctrines, indeed, the preference of a plural over a singular\r\nexecutive, will probably not be assented to here. When our present\r\ngovernment was first established, we had many doubts on this question,\r\nand many leanings towards a supreme executive counsel. It happened that\r\nat that time the experiment of such an one was commenced in France,\r\nwhile the single executive was under trial here. We watched the motions\r\nand effects of these two rival plans, with an interest and anxiety\r\nproportioned to the importance of a choice between them. The experiment\r\nin France failed after a short course, and not from any circumstance\r\npeculiar to the times or nation, but from those internal jealousies and\r\ndissensions in the Directory, which will ever arise among men equal in\r\npower, without a principal to decide and control their differences. We\r\nhad tried a similar experiment in 1784, by establishing a committee of\r\nthe States, composed of a member from every State, then thirteen, to\r\nexercise the executive functions during the recess of Congress. They\r\nfell immediately into schisms and dissensions, which became at length\r\nso inveterate as to render all co-operation among them impracticable,\r\nthey dissolved themselves, abandoning the helm of government, and it\r\ncontinued without a head, until Congress met the ensuing winter. This\r\nwas then imputed to the temper of two or three individuals; but the wise\r\nascribed it to the nature of man. The failure of the French Directory,\r\nand from the same cause, seems to have authorized a belief that the form\r\nof a plurality, however promising in theory, is impracticable with men\r\nconstituted with the ordinary passions. While the tranquil and steady\r\ntenor of our single executive, during a course of twenty-two years of the\r\nmost tempestuous times the history of the world has ever presented, gives\r\na rational hope that this important problem is at length solved. Aided by\r\nthe counsels of a cabinet of heads of departments, originally four, but\r\nnow five, with whom the President consults, either singly or altogether,\r\nhe has the benefit of their wisdom and information, brings their views\r\nto one centre, and produces an unity of action and direction in all the\r\nbranches of the government. The excellence of this construction of the\r\nexecutive power has already manifested itself here under very opposite\r\ncircumstances. During the administration of our first President, his\r\ncabinet of four members was equally divided by as marked an opposition of\r\nprinciple as monarchism and republicanism could bring into conflict. Had\r\nthat cabinet been a directory, like positive and negative quantities in\r\nalgebra, the opposing wills would have balanced each other and produced\r\na state of absolute inaction. But the President heard with calmness the\r\nopinions and reasons of each, decided the course to be pursued, and kept\r\nthe government steadily in it, unaffected by the agitation. The public\r\nknew well the dissensions of the cabinet, but never had an uneasy thought\r\non their account, because they knew also they had provided a regulating\r\npower which would keep the machine in steady movement. I speak with\r\nan intimate knowledge of these scenes, _quorum pars fui_; as I may of\r\nothers of a character entirely opposite. The third administration, which\r\nwas of eight years, presented an example of harmony in a cabinet of six\r\npersons, to which perhaps history has furnished no parallel. There never\r\narose, during the whole time, an instance of an unpleasant thought or\r\nword between the members. We sometimes met under differences of opinion,\r\nbut scarcely ever failed, by conversing and reasoning, so to modify each\r\nother's ideas, as to produce an unanimous result. Yet, able and amicable\r\nas these members were, I am not certain this would have been the case,\r\nhad each possessed equal and independent powers. Ill-defined limits of\r\ntheir respective departments, jealousies, trifling at first, but nourished\r\nand strengthened by repetition of occasions, intrigues without doors of\r\ndesigning persons to build an importance to themselves on the divisions\r\nof others, might, from small beginnings, have produced persevering\r\noppositions. But the power of decision in the President left no object for\r\ninternal dissension, and external intrigue was stifled in embryo by the\r\nknowledge which incendiaries possessed, that no division they could foment\r\nwould change the course of the executive power. I am not conscious that\r\nmy participations in executive authority have produced any bias in favor\r\nof the single executive; because the parts I have acted have been in the\r\nsubordinate, as well as superior stations, and because, if I know myself,\r\nwhat I have felt, and what I have wished, I know that I have never been so\r\nwell pleased, as when I could shift power from my own, on the shoulders of\r\nothers; nor have I ever been able to conceive how any rational being could\r\npropose happiness to himself from the exercise of power over others.\r\n\r\nI am still, however, sensible of the solidity of your principle, that,\r\nto insure the safety of the public liberty, its depository should be\r\nsubject to be changed with the greatest ease possible, and without\r\nsuspending or disturbing for a moment the movements of the machine of\r\ngovernment. You apprehend that a single executive, with eminence of\r\ntalent, and destitution of principle, equal to the object, might, by\r\nusurpation, render his powers hereditary. Yet I think history furnishes\r\nas many examples of a single usurper arising out of a government by a\r\nplurality, as of temporary trusts of power in a single hand rendered\r\npermanent by usurpation. I do not believe, therefore, that this danger\r\nis lessened in the hands of a plural executive. Perhaps it is greatly\r\nincreased, by the state of inefficiency to which they are liable from\r\nfeuds and divisions among themselves. The conservative body you propose\r\nmight be so constituted, as, while it would be an admirable sedative in a\r\nvariety of smaller cases, might also be a valuable sentinel and check on\r\nthe liberticide views of an ambitious individual. I am friendly to this\r\nidea. But the true barriers of our liberty in this country are our State\r\ngovernments; and the wisest conservative power ever contrived by man, is\r\nthat of which our Revolution and present government found us possessed.\r\nSeventeen distinct States, amalgamated into one as to their foreign\r\nconcerns, but single and independent as to their internal administration,\r\nregularly organized with a legislature and governor resting on the choice\r\nof the people, and enlightened by a free press, can never be so fascinated\r\nby the arts of one man, as to submit voluntarily to his usurpation. Nor\r\ncan they be constrained to it by any force he can possess. While that may\r\nparalyze the single State in which it happens to be encamped, sixteen\r\nothers, spread over a country of two thousand miles diameter, rise up\r\non every side, ready organized for deliberation by a constitutional\r\nlegislature, and for action by their governor, constitutionally the\r\ncommander of the militia of the State, that is to say, of every man in it\r\nable to bear arms; and that militia, too, regularly formed into regiments\r\nand battalions, into infantry, cavalry and artillery, trained under\r\nofficers general and subordinate, legally appointed, always in readiness,\r\nand to whom they are already in habits of obedience. The republican\r\ngovernment of France was lost without a struggle, because the party of\r\n\"_un et indivisible_\" had prevailed; no provincial organizations existed\r\nto which the people might rally under authority of the laws, the seats\r\nof the directory were virtually vacant, and a small force sufficed to\r\nturn the legislature out of their chamber, and to salute its leader chief\r\nof the nation. But with us, sixteen out of seventeen States rising in\r\nmass, under regular organization, and legal commanders, united in object\r\nand action by their Congress, or, if that be in _duresse_, by a special\r\nconvention, present such obstacles to an usurper as forever to stifle\r\nambition in the first conception of that object.\r\n\r\nDangers of another kind might more reasonably be apprehended from this\r\nperfect and distinct organization, civil and military, of the States;\r\nto wit, that certain States from local and occasional discontents, might\r\nattempt to secede from the Union. This is certainly possible; and would\r\nbe befriended by this regular organization. But it is not probable that\r\nlocal discontents can spread to such an extent, as to be able to face\r\nthe sound parts of so extensive an Union; and if ever they should reach\r\nthe majority, they would then become the regular government, acquire the\r\nascendency in Congress, and be able to redress their own grievances by\r\nlaws peaceably and constitutionally passed. And even the States in which\r\nlocal discontents might engender a commencement of fermentation, would be\r\nparalyzed and self-checked by that very division into parties into which\r\nwe have fallen, into which all States must fall wherein men are at liberty\r\nto think, speak, and act freely, according to the diversities of their\r\nindividual conformations, and which are, perhaps, essential to preserve\r\nthe purity of the government, by the censorship which these parties\r\nhabitually exercise over each other.\r\n\r\nYou will read, I am sure, with indulgence, the explanations of the grounds\r\non which I have ventured to form an opinion differing from yours. They\r\nprove my respect for your judgment, and diffidence in my own, which have\r\nforbidden me to retain, without examination, an opinion questioned by\r\nyou. Permit me now to render my portion of the general debt of gratitude,\r\nby acknowledgments in advance for the singular benefaction which is the\r\nsubject of this letter, to tender my wishes for the continuance of a life\r\nso usefully employed, and to add the assurances of my perfect esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 8, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On my return from a journey of five weeks to Bedford I found\r\nhere the two letters now enclosed, which though directed to me, belong, in\r\ntheir matter, to you. I never before heard of either writer, and therefore\r\nleave them to stand on their own grounds.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the close of your campaign. Although it has not\r\nconquered your difficulties, it leaves you more at leisure to consider\r\nand provide against them. Our only chance as to England is the accession\r\nof the Prince of Wales to the throne. If only to the regency, himself and\r\nhis ministers may be less bold and strong to make a thorough change of\r\nsystem. It will leave them, too, a pretext for doing less than right, if\r\nso disposed. He has much more understanding and good humor than principle\r\nor application. But it seems difficult to understand what Bonaparte means\r\ntowards us. I have been in hopes the consultations with closed doors were\r\nfor taking possession of East Florida. It would give no more offence\r\nanywhere than taking the Western province, and I am much afraid the\r\nPercival ministry may have given orders for taking possession of it before\r\nthey were put out of power.\r\n\r\nWe have had a wretched winter for the farmer. Great consumption of food by\r\nthe cattle, and little weather for preparing the ensuing crop. During my\r\nstay in Bedford we had seven snows, that of February 22, which was of 15\r\ninches about Richmond, was of 6 inches here, and only 3½ in Bedford. Ever\r\naffectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WILKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 10, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of January 21st has been received, and with it the\r\n2d volume of your Memoirs, with the appendices to the 1st, 2d and 4th\r\nvolumes, for which accept my thanks. I shall read them with pleasure.\r\nThe expression respecting myself, stated in your letter to have been\r\nimputed to you by your calumniators, had either never been heard by me,\r\nor, if heard, had been unheeded and forgotten. I have been too much the\r\nbutt of such falsehoods myself to do others the injustice of permitting\r\nthem to make the least impression on me. My consciousness that no man\r\non earth has me under his thumb is evidence enough that you never used\r\nthe expression. Daniel Clarke's book I have never seen, nor should I put\r\nTacitus or Thucydides out of my hand to take that up. I am even leaving\r\noff the newspapers, desirous to disengage myself from the contentions of\r\nthe world, and consign to entire tranquillity and to the kinder passions\r\nwhat remains to me of life. I look back with commiseration on those still\r\nbuffeting the storm, and sincerely wish your argosy may ride out, unhurt,\r\nthat in which it is engaged. My belief is that it will, and I found that\r\nbelief on my own knowledge of Burr's transactions, on my view of your\r\nconduct in encountering them, and on the candor of your judges. I salute\r\nyou with my best wishes and entire respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN MELISH.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 10, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I thank you for your letter of February 16th, and the communication\r\nof that you had forwarded to the President. In his hands it may be\r\nturned to public account; in mine it is only evidence of your zeal for\r\nthe general good. My occupations are now in quite a different line, more\r\nsuited to my age, my interests and inclinations. Having served my tour of\r\nduty, I leave public cares to younger and more vigorous minds, and repose\r\nmy personal well-being under their guardianship, in perfect confidence\r\nof its safety. Our ship is sound, the crew alert at their posts, and our\r\nablest steersman at its helm. That she will make a safe port I have no\r\ndoubt; and that she may, I offer to heaven my daily prayers, the proper\r\nfunction of age, and add to yourself the assurance of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL WILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 28, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I learn with sincere concern, from yours of the 15th received\r\nby our last mail, the difficulties into which you are brought by the\r\nretirement of particular friends from the accommodations they had been\r\nin the habit of yielding you. That one of those you name should have\r\nseparated from the censor of John Randolph, is consonant with the change\r\nof disposition which took place in him at Washington. That the other,\r\nfar above that bias, should have done so, was not expected. I have ever\r\nlooked to Mr. Lieper as one of the truest republicans of our country,\r\nwhose mind, unaffected by personal incidents, pursues its course with a\r\nsteadiness of which we have rare examples. Looking about for a motive, I\r\nhave supposed it was to be found in the late arraignments of Mr. Gallatin\r\nin your papers. However he might differ from you on that subject, as I do\r\nmyself, the indulgences in difference of opinion which we all owe to one\r\nanother, and every one needs for himself, would, I thought, in a mind like\r\nhis, have prevented such a manifestation of it. I believe Mr. Gallatin\r\nto be of a pure integrity, and as zealously devoted to the liberties and\r\ninterests of our country as its most affectionate native citizen. Of this\r\nhis courage in Congress in the days of terror, gave proofs which nothing\r\ncan obliterate from the recollection of those who were witnesses of it.\r\nThese are probably the opinions of Mr. Lieper, as I believe they are of\r\nevery man intimately acquainted with Mr. Gallatin. An intercourse, almost\r\ndaily, of eight years with him, has given me opportunities of knowing\r\nhis character more thoroughly than perhaps any other man living; and I\r\nhave ascribed the erroneous estimate you have formed of it to the want of\r\nthat intimate knowledge of him which I possessed. Every one, certainly,\r\nmust form his judgment on the evidence accessible to himself; and I\r\nhave no more doubt of the integrity of your convictions than I have of\r\nmy own. They are drawn from different materials and different sources\r\nof information, more or less perfect, according to our opportunities.\r\nThe zeal, the disinterestedness, and the abilities with which you have\r\nsupported the great principles of our revolution, the persecutions you\r\nhave suffered, and the firmness and independence with which you have\r\nsuffered them, constitute too strong a claim on the good wishes of\r\nevery friend of elective government, to be effaced by a solitary ease of\r\ndifference in opinion. Thus I think, and thus I believed my much-esteemed\r\nfriend Lieper would have thought; and I am the more concerned he does not,\r\nas it is so much more in his power to be useful to you than in mine. His\r\nresidence, and his standing at the great seat of the monied institutions,\r\ncommand a credit with them, which no inhabitant of the country, and\r\nof agricultural pursuits only, can have. The two or three banks in our\r\nuncommercial State are too distant to have any relations with the farmers\r\nof Albemarle. We are persuaded you have not overrated the dispositions\r\nof this State to support yourself and your paper. They have felt its\r\nservices too often to be indifferent in the hour of trial. They are well\r\naware that the days of danger are not yet over. And I am sensible that if\r\nthere were any means of bringing into concert the good will of the friends\r\nof the \"Aurora\" scattered over this State, they would not deceive your\r\nexpectations. One month sooner might have found such an opportunity in\r\nthe assemblage of our legislature in Richmond. But that is now dispersed\r\nnot to meet again under a twelvemonth. We, here, are but one of a hundred\r\ncounties, and on consultation with friends of the neighborhood, it is\r\ntheir opinion that if we can find an endorser resident in Richmond,\r\n(for that is indispensable,) ten or twelve persons of this county would\r\nreadily engage, as you suggest, for their $100 each, and some of them\r\nfor more. It is believed that the republicans in that city can and will\r\ndo a great deal more; and perhaps their central position may enable them\r\nto communicate with other counties. We have written to a distinguished\r\nfriend to the cause of liberty there to take the lead in the business, as\r\nfar as concerns that place; and for our own, we are taking measures for\r\nobtaining the aid of the bank of the same place. In all this I am nearly\r\na cypher. Forty years of almost constant absence from the State have made\r\nme a stranger in it, have left me a solitary tree, from around which the\r\naxe of time has felled all the companions of its youth and growth. I have,\r\nhowever, engaged some active and zealous friends to do what I could not.\r\nTheir personal acquaintance and influence with those now in active life\r\ncan give effect to their efforts. But our support can be but partial, and\r\nfar short, both in time and measure, of your difficulties. They will be\r\nlittle more than evidences of our friendship. The truth is that farmers,\r\nas we all are, have no command of money. Our necessaries are all supplied,\r\neither from our farms, or a neighboring store. Our produce, at the end\r\nof the year, is delivered to the merchant, and thus the business of the\r\nyear is done by barter, without the intervention of scarcely a dollar;\r\nand thus also we live with a plenty of everything except money. To raise\r\nthat negociations and time are requisite. I sincerely wish that greater\r\nand prompter effects could have flowed from our good will. On my part, no\r\nendeavors or sacrifices shall be withheld. But we are bound down by the\r\nlaws of our situation.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I am able at present to form a just idea of the\r\nsituation of our country. If I am, it is such as, during the _bellum\r\nomnium in omnia_ of Europe, will require the union of all its friends to\r\nresist its enemies within and without. If we schismatize on either men\r\nor measures, if we do not act in phalanx, as when we rescued it from the\r\nsatellites of monarchism, I will not say our _party_, the term is false\r\nand degrading, but our _nation_ will be undone. For the republicans are\r\nthe _nation_. Their opponents are but a faction, weak in numbers, but\r\npowerful and profuse in the command of money, and backed by a nation,\r\npowerful also and profuse in the use of the same means; and the more\r\nprofuse, in both cases, as the money they thus employ is not their own but\r\ntheir creditors, to be paid off by a bankruptcy, which whether it pays a\r\ndollar or a shilling in the pound is of little concern with them. The last\r\nhope of human liberty in this world rests on us. We ought, for so dear a\r\nstate, to sacrifice every attachment and every enmity. Leave the President\r\nfree to chose his own coadjutors, to pursue his own measures, and support\r\nhim and them, even if we think we are wiser than they, honester than they\r\nare, or possessing more enlarged information of the state of things. If\r\nwe move in mass, be it ever so circuitously, we shall attain our object;\r\nbut if we break into squads, every one pursuing the path he thinks most\r\ndirect, we become an easy conquest to those who can now barely hold us in\r\ncheck. I repeat again, that we ought not to schismatize on either men or\r\nmeasures. Principles alone can justify that. If we find our government\r\nin all its branches rushing headlong, like our predecessors, into the\r\narms of monarchy, if we find them violating our dearest rights, the\r\ntrial by jury, the freedom of the press, the freedom of opinion, civil or\r\nreligious, or opening on our peace of mind or personal safety the sluices\r\nof terrorism, if we see them raising standing armies, when the absence of\r\nall other danger points to these as the sole objects on which they are to\r\nbe employed, then indeed let us withdraw and call the nation to its tents.\r\nBut while our functionaries are wise, and honest, and vigilant, let us\r\nmove compactly under their guidance, and we have nothing to fear. Things\r\nmay here and there go a little wrong. It is not in their power to prevent\r\nit. But all will be right in the end, though not perhaps by the shortest\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nYou know, my dear Sir, that this union of republicans has been the\r\nconstant theme of my exhortations, that I have ever refused to know any\r\nsubdivisions among them, to take part in any personal differences; and\r\ntherefore you will not give to the present observations any other than\r\ngeneral application. I may sometimes differ in opinion from some of my\r\nfriends, from those whose views are as pure and sound as my own. I censure\r\nnone, but do homage to every one's right of opinion. If I have indulged\r\nmy pen, therefore, a little further than the occasion called for, you will\r\nascribe it to a sermonizing habit, to the anxieties of age, perhaps to its\r\ngarrulity, or to any other motive rather than the want of the esteem and\r\nconfidence of which I pray you to accept sincere assurances.\r\n\r\nP. S. Absorbed in a subject more nearly interesting, I had forgotten\r\nour book on the heresies of Montesquieu. I sincerely hope the removal of\r\nall embarrassment will enable you to go on with it, or so to dispose of\r\nit as that our country may have the benefit of the corrections it will\r\nadminister to public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LATROBE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 14, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I feel much concern that suggestions stated in your letter\r\nof the 5th instant, should at this distance of time be the subject of\r\nuneasiness to you, and I regret it the more as they make appeals to\r\nmemory, a faculty never strong in me, and now too sensibly impaired\r\nto be relied on. It retains no trace of the particular conversations\r\nalluded to, nor enables me to say that they are or are not correct. The\r\nonly safe appeal for me is to the general impressions received at the\r\ntime, and still retained with sufficient distinctness. These were that\r\nyou discharged the duties of your appointment with ability, diligence\r\nand zeal, but that in the article of expense you were not sufficiently\r\nguarded. You must remember my frequent cautions to you on this head, the\r\nmeasures I took, by calling for frequent accounts of expenditures and\r\ncontracts, to mark to you, as well as to myself, when they were getting\r\nbeyond the limits of the appropriations, and the afflicting embarrassments\r\nof a particular occasion where these limits had been unguardedly and\r\ngreatly transcended. These sentiments I communicated to you freely at the\r\ntime, as it was my duty to do. Another principle of conduct with me was\r\nto admit no innovations on the established plans, but on the strongest\r\ngrounds. When, therefore, I thought first of placing the floor of the\r\nRepresentative chamber on the level of the basement of the building, and\r\nof throwing into its height the cavity of the dome, in the manner of the\r\nHalle aux Bleds at Paris, I deemed it due to Dr. Thornton, author of the\r\nplan of the Capitol, to consult him on the change. He not only consented,\r\nbut appeared heartily to approve of the alteration. For the same reason,\r\nas well as on motives of economy, I was anxious, in converting the Senate\r\nchamber into a Judiciary room, to preserve its original form, and to leave\r\nthe same arches and columns standing. On your representation, however,\r\nthat the columns were decayed and incompetent to support the incumbent\r\nweight, I acquiesced in the change you proposed, only striking out the\r\naddition which would have made part of the middle building, and would\r\ninvolve a radical change in that which had not been sanctioned. I have\r\nno reason to doubt but that in the execution of the Senate and Court\r\nrooms, you have adhered to the plan communicated to me and approved;\r\nbut never having seen them since their completion, I am not able to say\r\nso expressly. On the whole, I do not believe any one has ever done more\r\njustice to your professional abilities than myself. Besides constant\r\ncommendations of your taste in architecture, and science in execution,\r\nI declared on many and all occasions that I considered you as the only\r\nperson in the United States who could have executed the Representative\r\nchamber, or who could execute the middle buildings on any of the plans\r\nproposed. There have been too many witnesses of these declarations to\r\nleave any doubt as to my opinion on this subject. Of the value I set on\r\nyour society, our intercourse before as well as during my office, can have\r\nleft no doubt with you; and I should be happy in giving further proofs\r\nto you personally at Monticello, of which you have sometimes flattered me\r\nwith the hope of an opportunity.\r\n\r\nI have thus, Sir, stated general truths without going into the detail of\r\nparticular facts or expressions, to which my memory does not enable me\r\nto say yea or nay. But a consciousness of my consistency in private as\r\nwell as public, supports me in affirming that nothing ever passed from me\r\ncontradictory to these general truths, and that I have been misapprehended\r\nif it has ever been so supposed. I return you the plans received with\r\nyour letter, and pray you to accept assurances of my continued esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 14, 1811.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BARON,--The interruption of our intercourse with France for some\r\ntime past, has prevented my writing to you. A conveyance now occurs,\r\nby Mr. Barlow or Mr. Warden, both of them going in a public capacity.\r\nIt is the first safe opportunity offered of acknowledging your favor of\r\nSeptember 23d, and the receipt at different times of the IIId part of your\r\nvaluable work, 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th livraisons, and the IVth part, 2d, 3d,\r\nand 4th livraisons, with the _Tableaux de la nature_, and an interesting\r\nmap of New Spain. For these magnificent and much esteemed favors, accept\r\nmy sincere thanks. They give us a knowledge of that country more accurate\r\nthan I believe we possess of Europe, the seat of the science of a thousand\r\nyears. It comes out, too, at a moment when those countries are beginning\r\nto be interesting to the whole world. They are now becoming the scenes\r\nof political revolution, to take their stations as integral members of\r\nthe great family of nations. All are now in insurrection. In several, the\r\nIndependents are already triumphant, and they will undoubtedly be so in\r\nall. What kind of government will they establish? How much liberty can\r\nthey bear without intoxication? Are their chiefs sufficiently enlightened\r\nto form a well-guarded government, and their people to watch their\r\nchiefs? Have they mind enough to place their domesticated Indians on a\r\nfooting with the whites? All these questions you can answer better than\r\nany other. I imagine they will copy our outlines of confederation and\r\nelective government, abolish distinction of ranks, bow the neck to their\r\npriests, and persevere in intolerantism. Their greatest difficulty will be\r\nin the construction of their executive. I suspect that, regardless of the\r\nexperiment of France, and of that of the United States in 1784, they will\r\nbegin with a directory, and when the unavoidable schisms in that kind of\r\nexecutive shall drive them to something else, their great question will\r\ncome on whether to substitute an executive elective for years, for life,\r\nor an hereditary one. But unless instruction can be spread among them more\r\nrapidly than experience promises, despotism may come upon them before they\r\nare qualified to save the ground they will have gained. Could Napoleon\r\nobtain, at the close of the present war, the independence of all the West\r\nIndia islands, and their establishment in a separate confederacy, our\r\nquarter of the globe would exhibit an enrapturing prospect into futurity.\r\nYou will live to see much of this. I shall follow, however, cheerfully\r\nmy fellow laborers, contented with having borne a part in beginning this\r\nbeatific reformation.\r\n\r\nI fear, from some expressions in your letter, that your personal interests\r\nhave not been duly protected, while you were devoting your time, talents\r\nand labor for the information of mankind. I should sincerely regret it for\r\nthe honor of the governing powers, as well as from affectionate attachment\r\nto yourself and the sincerest wishes for your felicity, fortunes and fame.\r\n\r\nIn sending you a copy of my Notes on Virginia, I do but obey the desire\r\nyou have expressed. They must appear chetif enough to the author of the\r\ngreat work on South America. But from the widow her mite was welcome, and\r\nyou will add to this indulgence the acceptance of my sincere assurances of\r\nconstant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. PAGANEL.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 15, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received, through Mr. Warden, the copy of your valuable work on\r\nthe French revolution, for which I pray you to accept my thanks. That\r\nits sale should have been suppressed is no matter of wonder with me. The\r\nfriend of liberty is too feelingly manifested, not to give umbrage to its\r\nenemies. We read in it, and weep over, the fatal errors which have lost to\r\nnations the present hope of liberty, and to reason the fairest prospect of\r\nits final triumph over all imposture, civil and religious. The testimony\r\nof one who himself was an actor in the scenes he notes, and who knew the\r\ntrue mean between rational liberty and the frenzies of demagogy, are a\r\ntribute to truth of inestimable value. The perusal of this work has given\r\nme new views of the causes of failure in a revolution of which I was a\r\nwitness in its early part, and then augured well of it. I had no means,\r\nafterwards, of observing its progress but the public papers, and their\r\ninformation came through channels too hostile to claim confidence. An\r\nacquaintance with many of the principal characters, and with their fate,\r\nfurnished me grounds for conjectures, some of which you have confirmed,\r\nand some corrected. Shall we ever see as free and faithful a tableau\r\nof subsequent acts of this deplorable tragedy? Is reason to be forever\r\namused with the _hochets_ of physical sciences, in which she is indulged\r\nmerely to divert her from solid speculations on the rights of man, and\r\nwrongs of his oppressors? it is impossible. The day of deliverance will\r\ncome, although I shall not live to see it. The art of printing secures us\r\nagainst the retrogradation of reason and information, the examples of its\r\nsafe and wholesome guidance in government, which will be exhibited through\r\nthe wide-spread regions of the American continent, will obliterate, in\r\ntime, the impressions left by the abortive experiment of France. With my\r\nprayers for the hastening of that auspicious day, and for the due effect\r\nof the lessons of your work to those who ought to profit by them, accept\r\nthe assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 15, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of January\r\n20 and September 14, 1810, and, with the latter, your observations on the\r\nsubject of taxes. They bear the stamps of logic and eloquence which mark\r\neverything coming from you, and place the doctrines of the Economists\r\nin their strongest points of view. My present retirement and unmeddling\r\ndisposition make of this _une question viseuse pour moi_. But after\r\nreading the observations with great pleasure, I forwarded them to the\r\nPresident and Mr. Gallatin, in whose hands they may be useful. Yet I do\r\nnot believe the change of our system of taxation will be forced on us so\r\nearly as you expect, if war be avoided. It is true we are going greatly\r\ninto manufactures; but the mass of them are household manufactures of\r\nthe coarse articles worn by the laborers and farmers of the family.\r\nThese I verily believe we shall succeed in making to the whole extent\r\nof our necessities. But the attempts at fine goods will probably be\r\nabortive. They are undertaken by company establishments, and chiefly in\r\nthe towns; will have little success and short continuance in a country\r\nwhere the charms of agriculture attract every being who can engage in it.\r\nOur revenue will be less than it would be were we to continue to import\r\ninstead of manufacturing our coarse goods. But the increase of population\r\nand production will keep pace with that of manufactures, and maintain the\r\nquantum of exports at the present level at least; and the imports need be\r\nequivalent to them, and consequently the revenue on them be undiminished.\r\nI keep up my hopes that if war be avoided, Mr. Madison will be able to\r\ncomplete the payment of the national debt within his term, after which\r\none-third of the present revenue would support the government. Your\r\ninformation that a commencement of excise had been again made, is entirely\r\nunfounded. I hope the death blow to that most vexatious and unproductive\r\nof all taxes was given at the commencement of my administration, and\r\nbelieve its revival would give the death blow to any administration\r\nwhatever. In most of the middle and southern States some land tax is now\r\npaid into the State treasury, and for this purpose the lands have been\r\nclassed and valued, and the tax assessed according to that valuation.\r\nIn these an excise is most odious. In the eastern States land taxes are\r\nodious, excises less unpopular. We are all the more reconciled to the\r\ntax on importations, because it falls exclusively on the rich, and with\r\nthe equal partition of intestate's estates, constitute the best agrarian\r\nlaw. In fact, the poor man in this country who uses nothing but what is\r\nmade within his own farm or family, or within the United States, pays not\r\na farthing of tax to the general government, but on his salt; and should\r\nwe go into that manufacture as we ought to do, we will pay not one cent.\r\nOur revenues once liberated by the discharge of the public debt, and\r\nits surplus applied to canals, roads, schools, &c., and the farmer will\r\nsee his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his\r\ncountry made a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without\r\nhis being called on to spare a cent from his earnings. The path we are now\r\npursuing leads directly to this end, which we cannot fail to attain unless\r\nour administration should fall into unwise hands.\r\n\r\nAnother great field of political experiment is opening in our\r\nneighborhood, in Spanish America. I fear the degrading ignorance into\r\nwhich their priests and kings have sunk them, has disqualified them from\r\nthe maintenance or even knowledge of their rights, and that much blood may\r\nbe shed for little improvement in their condition. Should their new rulers\r\nhonestly lay their shoulders to remove the great obstacles of ignorance,\r\nand press the remedies of education and information, they will still be\r\nin jeopardy until another generation comes into place, and what may happen\r\nin the interval cannot be predicted, nor shall you or I live to see it. In\r\nthese cases I console myself with the reflection that those who will come\r\nafter us will be as wise as we are, and as able to take care of themselves\r\nas we have been. I hope you continue to preserve your health, and that\r\nyou may long continue to do so in happiness, is the prayer of yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 13, 1811.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL AND FRIEND,--My last letter to you was of the 26th of\r\nFebruary of the last year. Knowing of no particular conveyance, I confided\r\nit to the department of State, to be put under the cover of their public\r\ndespatches to General Armstrong or Mr. Warden. Not having been able to\r\nlearn whether it ever got to hand, I now enclose a duplicate.\r\n\r\nKnowing your affections to this country, and the interest you take in\r\nwhatever concerns it, I therein gave you a tableau of its state when\r\nI retired from the administration. The difficulties and embarrassments\r\nstill continued in our way by the two great belligerent powers, you are\r\nacquainted with. In other times, when there was some profession of regard\r\nfor right, some respect to reason, when a gross violation of these marked\r\na deliberate design of pointed injury, these would have been causes of\r\nwar. But when we see two antagonists contending _ad internecionem_, so\r\neager for mutual destruction as to disregard all means, to deal their\r\nblows in every direction regardless on whom they may fall, prudent\r\nbystanders, whom some of them may wound, instead of thinking it cause to\r\njoin in the maniac contest, get out of the way as well as they can, and\r\nleave the cannibals to mutual ravin. It would have been perfect Quixotism\r\nin us to have encountered these Bedlamites, to have undertaken the redress\r\nof all wrongs against a world avowedly rejecting all regard to right.\r\nWe have, therefore, remained in peace, suffering frequent injuries, but,\r\non the whole, multiplying, improving, prospering beyond all example. It\r\nis evident to all, that in spite of great losses much greater gains have\r\nensued. When these gladiators shall have worried each other into ruin or\r\nreason, instead of lying among the dead on the bloody arena, we shall have\r\nacquired a growth and strength which will place us _hors d'insulte_. Peace\r\nthen has been our principle, peace is our interest, and peace has saved to\r\nthe world this only plant of free and rational government now existing in\r\nit. If it can still be preserved, we shall soon see the final extinction\r\nof our national debt, and liberation of our revenues for the defence and\r\nimprovement of our country. These revenues will be levied entirely on\r\nthe rich, the business of household manufacture being now so established\r\nthat the farmer and laborer clothes himself entirely. The rich alone\r\nuse imported articles, and on these alone the whole taxes of the general\r\ngovernment are levied. The poor man who uses nothing but what is made in\r\nhis own farm or family, or within his own country, pays not a farthing\r\nof tax to the general government, but on his salt; and should we go into\r\nthat manufacture also, as is probable, he will pay nothing. Our revenues\r\nliberated by the discharge of the public debt, and its surplus applied to\r\ncanals, roads, schools, &c., the farmer will see his government supported,\r\nhis children educated, and the face of his country made a paradise by the\r\ncontributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a\r\ncent from his earnings. However, therefore, we may have been reproached\r\nfor pursuing our Quaker system, time will affix the stamp of wisdom on it,\r\nand the happiness and prosperity of our citizens will attest its merit.\r\nAnd this, I believe, is the only legitimate object of government, and the\r\nfirst duty of governors, and not the slaughter of men and devastation\r\nof the countries placed under their care, in pursuit of a fantastic\r\nhonor, unallied to virtue or happiness; or in gratification of the angry\r\npassions, or the pride of administrators, excited by personal incidents,\r\nin which their citizens have no concern. Some merit will be ascribed\r\nto the converting such times of destruction into times of growth and\r\nstrength for us. And behold! another example of man rising in his might\r\nand bursting the chains of his oppressor, and in the same hemisphere.\r\nSpanish America is all in revolt. The insurgents are triumphant in many of\r\nthe States, and will be so in all. But there the danger is that the cruel\r\narts of their oppressors have enchained their minds, have kept them in the\r\nignorance of children, and as incapable of self-government as children. If\r\nthe obstacles of bigotry and priest-craft can be surmounted, we may hope\r\nthat common-sense will suffice to do everything else. God send them a safe\r\ndeliverance. As to the private matter explained in my letter of February\r\n26, the time I shall have occasion for your indulgence will not be longer\r\nthan there stated, and may be shortened if either your convenience or will\r\nshould require it. God bless you, and give you many years of health and\r\nhappiness, and that you may live to see more of the liberty you love than\r\npresent appearances promise.\r\n\r\nP. S. Mr. Barnes is now looking out for bills for your usual annual\r\nremittance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 16, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I felicitate you sincerely on your destination to Paris,\r\nbecause I believe it will contribute both to your happiness and the public\r\ngood. Yet it is not unmixed with regret. What is to become of our past\r\nrevolutionary history? Of the antidotes of truth to the misrepresentations\r\nof Marshall? This example proves the wisdom of the maxim, never to put off\r\nto to-morrow what can be done to-day. But, putting aside vain regrets,\r\nI shall be happy to hear from you in your new situation. I cannot offer\r\nyou in exchange the minutiæ of the Cabinet, the workings in Congress,\r\nor under-workings of those around them. General views are all which we\r\nat a distance can have, but general views are sometimes better taken at\r\na distance than nearer. The working of the whole machine is sometimes\r\nbetter seen elsewhere than at its centre. In return you can give me the\r\ntrue state of things in Europe, what is its real public mind at present,\r\nits disposition towards the existing authority, its secret purposes and\r\nfuture prospects, seasoned with the literary news. I do not propose this\r\nas an equal barter, because it is really asking you to give a dollar for\r\na shilling. I must leave the difference to be made up from other motives.\r\nI have been long waiting for a safe opportunity to write to some friends\r\nand correspondents in France. I troubled Mr. Warden with some letters,\r\nand he kindly offered to take all I could get ready before his departure.\r\nBut his departure seems not yet definitely settled, and should he no go\r\nwith you, what is in your hands will be less liable to violation than in\r\nhis. I therefore take the liberty of asking your care of the letters now\r\nenclosed, and their delivery through confidential hands. Most of them are\r\nof a complexion not proper for the eye of the police, and might do injury\r\nto those to whom they are addressed. Wishing to yourself and Mrs. Barlow a\r\nhappy voyage, and that the execution of the duties of your mission may be\r\nattended with all agreeable circumstances, I salute you with assurance of\r\nmy perfect esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 24, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A book confided to me by a friend for translation and\r\npublication has for a twelvemonth past kept me in correspondence with\r\nColonel Duane. We undertook to have it translated and published. The\r\nlast sheets had been revised, and in a late letter to him, I pressed\r\nthe printing. I soon afterwards received one from him informing me that\r\nit would be much retarded by embarrassments recently brought on him by\r\nhis friends withdrawing their aid who had been in the habit of lending\r\ntheir names for his accommodation in the banks. He painted his situation\r\nas truly distressing, and intimated the way in which relief would be\r\nacceptable. The course I pursued on the occasion will be explained to you\r\nin a letter which I have written to the President, and asked the favor of\r\nhim to communicate to you.\r\n\r\nA difference of quite another character gives me more uneasiness. No\r\none feels more painfully than I do, the separation of friends, and\r\nespecially when their sensibilities are to be daily harrowed up by\r\ncannibal newspapers. In these cases, however, I claim from all parties the\r\nprivilege of neutrality, and to be permitted to esteem all as I ever did.\r\nThe harmony which made me happy while at Washington, is as dear to me now\r\nas then, and I should be equally afflicted, were it, by any circumstance,\r\nto be impaired as to myself. I have so much confidence in the candor and\r\ngood sense of both parties, as to trust that the misunderstanding will\r\nlead to no sinister effects, and my constant prayer will be for blessings\r\non you all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT SMITH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 30, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have learnt, with sincere concern, the circumstances\r\nwhich have taken place at Washington. Some intimations had been quoted\r\nfrom federal papers, which I had supposed false, as usual. Their first\r\nconfirmation to me was from the National Intelligencer. Still my hopes and\r\nconfidence were that your retirement was purely a matter of choice on your\r\npart. A letter I have received from Mr. Hollins makes me suppose there was\r\na more serious misunderstanding than I had apprehended. The newspapers\r\nindeed had said so, but I yield little faith to them. No one feels\r\nmore painfully than I do the separation of friends, and especially when\r\ntheir sensibilities are to be daily harrowed up by cannibal newspapers.\r\nSuffering myself under whatever inflicts sufferance on them, I condole\r\nwith them mutually, and ask the mutual permission to esteem all, as I\r\never did; not to know their differences nor ask the causes of them. The\r\nharmony which made me happy at Washington, is as dear to me now as it\r\nwas then, and I should be equally afflicted were it by any circumstance\r\nto be impaired as to myself. I have so much confidence in the candor and\r\nliberality of both parties, as to trust that the misunderstanding will not\r\nbe permitted to lead to any sinister effects, and my constant prayer will\r\nbe for blessings on you all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL WILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 30, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--When I wrote you my letter of March 28, I had great confidence\r\nthat as much at least could have been done for you as I therein supposed.\r\nThe friend to whom I confided the business here, and who was and is\r\nzealous, had found such readiness in those to whom he spoke, as left no\r\nother difficulty than to find the bank responsible. But the Auroras which\r\ncame on while this was in transaction, changed the prospect altogether,\r\nand produced a general revulsion of sentiment. The President's popularity\r\nis high through this State, and nowhere higher than here. They considered\r\nthese papers as a denunciation of war against him, and instantly withdrew\r\ntheir offers. I cannot give you a better account of the effect of the\r\nsame papers in Richmond than by quoting the letter of a friend who there\r\nundertook the same office, and with great cordiality. In a letter to me of\r\nApril 17, he says, \"yours of the 15th, in reply to mine of the 10th inst.,\r\nhas been brought to me from the office this instant. On showing it to ----\r\nthe effect of it was to dispose him to lend $500, and I wrote my letter\r\nof the 10th to you in a persuasion produced by that incident, as well as\r\nby its effect on my own feelings, that something important might be done\r\nfor D. in spite of the adverse spirit, or at least distrust, which the\r\nequivocal character of his paper has lately excited, equivocal in relation\r\nto Mr. Madison. But D.'s three or four last papers contain such paragraphs\r\nin relation to Mr. Madison, that even your letter cannot now serve him.\r\nThe paper is now regarded as an opposition one, and the republicans\r\nhere have no sympathy with any one who carries opposition colors. Every\r\ngentleman who mentions this subject in my hearing, speaks with the warmest\r\nresentment against D. Believe me, Sir, it is impossible to do anything\r\nfor him here now; and any further attempts would only disable me from\r\nrendering any service to the cause hereafter. I am persuaded that you\r\nwill see this subject in its true light, and be assured that it is the\r\nimpracticability of serving him, produced by himself, as well as the\r\nviolation which I feel it would be of my sentiments for Mr. Madison, that\r\nprevents me from proceeding.\" The firm, yet modest character of the writer\r\nof this letter gives great weight to what he says, and I have thought it\r\nbest to state it in his own terms, because it will be better evidence to\r\nyou than any general description I could give of the impression made by\r\nyour late papers. Indeed I could give none, for going little from home,\r\nI cannot personally estimate the public sentiment. The few I see are very\r\nunanimous in support of their Executive and legislative functionaries. I\r\nhave thought it well, too, that you should know exactly the feelings here,\r\nbecause if you get similar information from other respectable portions of\r\nthe union, it will naturally beget some suspicion in your own mind that\r\nfinding such a mass of opinion variant from your own, you may be under\r\nerroneous impressions, meriting re-examination and consideration. I think\r\nan Editor should be independent, that is, of personal influence, and not\r\nbe moved from his opinions on the mere authority of any individual. But,\r\nwith respect to the general opinion of the political section with which he\r\nhabitually accords, his duty seems very like that of a member of Congress.\r\nSome of these indeed think that independence requires them to follow\r\nalways their own opinion, without respect for that of others. This has\r\nnever been my opinion, nor my practice, when I have been of that or any\r\nother body. Differing, on a particular question, from those whom I knew to\r\nbe of the same political principles with myself, and with whom I generally\r\nthought and acted, a consciousness of the fallibility of the human mind,\r\nand of my own in particular, with a respect for the accumulated judgment\r\nof my friends, has induced me to suspect erroneous impressions in myself,\r\nto suppose my own opinion wrong, and to act with them on theirs. The want\r\nof this spirit of compromise, or of self-distrust, proudly, but falsely\r\ncalled independence, is what gives the federalists victories which they\r\ncould never obtain, if these brethren could learn to respect the opinions\r\nof their friends more than of their enemies, and prevents many able and\r\nhonest men from doing all the good they otherwise might do. I state these\r\nconsiderations because they have often quieted my own conscience in voting\r\nand acting on the judgment of others against my own; and because they\r\nmay suggest doubts to yourself in the present case. Our Executive and\r\nlegislative authorities are the choice of the nation, and possess the\r\nnation's confidence. They are chosen because they possess it, and the\r\nrecent elections prove it has not been abated by the attacks which have\r\nfor some time been kept up against them. If the measures which have been\r\npursued are approved by the majority, it is the duty of the minority to\r\nacquiesce and conform. It is true indeed that dissentients have a right\r\nto go over to the minority, and to act with them. But I do not believe\r\nyour mind has contemplated that course, that it has deliberately viewed\r\nthe strange company into which it may be led, step by step, unintended\r\nand unperceived by itself. The example of John Randolph is a caution to\r\nall honest and prudent men, to sacrifice a little of self-confidence,\r\nand to go with their friends, although they may sometimes think they are\r\ngoing wrong. After so long a course of steady adherence to the general\r\nsentiments of the republicans, it would afflict me sincerely to see you\r\nseparate from the body, become auxiliary to the enemies of our government,\r\nwho have to you been the bitterest enemies, who are now chuckling at the\r\nprospect of division among us, and, as I am told, are subscribing for your\r\npaper. The best indication of error which my experience has tested, is\r\nthe approbation of the federalists. Their conclusions necessarily follow\r\nthe false bias of their principles. I claim, however, no right of guiding\r\nthe conduct of others; but have indulged myself in these observations from\r\nthe sincere feelings of my heart. Retired from all political interferences\r\nI have been induced into this one by a desire, first of being useful to\r\nyou personally, and next of maintaining the republican ascendency. Be its\r\neffect what it may, I am done with it, and shall look on as an inactive,\r\nthough not an unfeeling, spectator of what is to ensue. As far as my good\r\nwill may go, for I can no longer act, I shall adhere to my government\r\nexecutive and legislative, and, as long as they are republican, I shall go\r\nwith their measures, whether I think them right or wrong; because I know\r\nthey are honest, and are wiser and better informed than I am. In doing\r\nthis, however, I shall not give up the friendship of those who differ from\r\nme, and who have equal right with myself to shape their own course. In\r\nthis disposition be assured of my continued esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. Be so good as to consider the extract from my friend's letter as\r\nconfidential, because I have not his permission to make this use of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WIRT.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 3, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The interest you were so kind as to take, at my request, in\r\nthe case of Duane, and the communication to you of my first letter to\r\nhim, entitles you to a communication of the 2d, which will probably be\r\nthe last. I have ventured to quote your letter in it, without giving\r\nyour name, and even softening some of its expressions respecting him.\r\nIt is possible Duane may be reclaimed as to Mr. Madison. But as to Mr.\r\nGallatin, I despair of it. That enmity took its rise from a suspicion\r\nthat Mr. Gallatin interested himself in the election of their governor\r\nagainst the views of Duane and his friends. I do not believe Mr. Gallatin\r\nmeddled in it. I was in conversation with him nearly every day during\r\nthe contest, and never heard him express any bias in the case. The\r\nostensible grounds of the attack on Mr. Gallatin are all either false or\r\nfutile. 1st. They urge his conversations with John Randolph. But who has\r\nrevealed these conversations? What evidence have we of them? merely some\r\noracular sentences from J. R., uttered in the heat of declamation, and\r\nnever stated with all their circumstances. For instance, that a cabinet\r\nmember informed him there was no cabinet. But Duane himself has always\r\ndenied there could be a legal one. Besides, the fact was true at that\r\nmoment, to-wit: early in the session of Congress. I had been absent from\r\nWashington from the middle of July to within three weeks of their meeting.\r\nDuring the separation of the members there could be no consultation, and\r\nbetween our return to Washington and the meeting of Congress, there really\r\nhad arisen nothing requiring general consultation, nothing which could\r\nnot be done in the ordinary way by consultation between the President\r\nand the head of the department to which the matter belonged, which is the\r\nway everything is transacted which is not difficult as well as important.\r\nMr. Gallatin might therefore have said this as innocently as truly, and\r\na malignant perversion of it was perfectly within the character of John\r\nRandolph. But the story of the two millions. Mr. Gallatin satisfied us\r\nthat this affirmation of J. R. was as unauthorized as the fact itself\r\nwas false. It resolves itself, therefore, into his inexplicit letter to a\r\ncommittee of Congress. As to this, my own surmise was that Mr. Gallatin\r\nmight have used some hypothetical expression in conversing on that\r\nsubject, which J. R. made a positive one, and he being a duellist, and\r\nMr. Gallatin with a wife and children depending on him for their daily\r\nsubsistence, the latter might wish to avoid collision and insult from such\r\na man. But they say he was hostile to me. This is false. I was indebted\r\nto nobody for more cordial aid than to Mr. Gallatin, nor could any man\r\nmore solicitously interest himself in behalf of another than he did of\r\nmyself. His conversations with Erskine are objected as meddling out of\r\nhis department. Why, then, do they not object Mr. Smith's with Rose? the\r\nwhole, nearly, of that negotiation, as far as it was transacted verbally,\r\nwas by Mr. Smith. The business was in this way explained informally,\r\nand on understandings thus obtained, Mr. Madison and myself shaped our\r\nformal proceedings. In fact, the harmony among us was so perfect, that\r\nwhatever instrument appeared most likely to effect the object, was always\r\nused without jealousy. Mr. Smith happened to catch Mr. Rose's favor\r\nand confidence at once. We perceived that Rose would open himself more\r\nfrankly to him than to Mr. Madison, and we therefore made him the medium\r\nof obtaining an understanding of Mr. Rose. Mr. Gallatin's support of the\r\nbank has, I believe, been disapproved by many. He was not in Congress\r\nwhen that was established, and therefore had never committed himself,\r\npublicly, on the constitutionality of that institution, nor do I recollect\r\never to have heard him declare himself on it. I know he derived immense\r\nconvenience from it, because they gave the effect of ubiquity to his money\r\nwherever deposited. Money in New Orleans or Maine was at his command,\r\nand by their agency transformed in an instant into money in London, in\r\nParis, Amsterdam or Canton. He was, therefore, cordial to the bank. I\r\noften pressed him to divide the public deposits among all the respectable\r\nbanks, being indignant myself at the open hostility of that institution to\r\na government on whose treasuries they were fattening. But his repugnance\r\nto it prevented my persisting. And if he was in favor of the bank, what is\r\nthe amount of that crime or error in which he had a majority save one in\r\neach House of Congress as participators? yet on these facts, endeavors are\r\nmade to drive from the administration the ablest man except the President,\r\nwho ever was in it, and to beat down the President himself, because he is\r\nunwilling to part with so able a counseller. I believe Duane to be a very\r\nhonest man and sincerely republican; but his passions are stronger than\r\nhis prudence, and his personal as well as general antipathies render him\r\nvery intolerant. These traits lead him astray, and require his readers,\r\neven those who value him for his steady support of the republican cause,\r\nto be on their guard against his occasional aberrations. He is eager for\r\nwar against England, hence his abuse of the two last Congresses. But the\r\npeople wish for peace. The re-elections of the same men prove it. And\r\nindeed, war against bedlam would be just as rational as against Europe in\r\nits present condition of total demoralization. When peace becomes more\r\nlosing than war, we may prefer the latter on principles of pecuniary\r\ncalculation. But for us to attempt, by war, to reform all Europe, and\r\nbring them back to principles of morality and a respect for the equal\r\nrights of nations, would show us to be only maniacs of another character.\r\nWe should, indeed, have the merit of the good intentions as well as of\r\nthe folly of the hero of La Mancha. But I am getting beyond the object of\r\nmy letter, and will therefore here close it with assurances of my great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WIRT.\r\n\r\nI have rejoiced to see Ritchie declare himself in favor of the President\r\non the late attack against him, and wish he may do the same as to Mr.\r\nGallatin. I am sure he would if his information was full. I have not an\r\nintimacy with him which might justify my writing to him directly, but the\r\nenclosed letter to you is put into such a form as might be shown to him,\r\nif you think proper to do so. Perhaps the facts stated in it, probably\r\nunknown to him, may have some effect. But do in this as you think best.\r\nBe so good as to return the letter to Duane, being my only copy, and to be\r\nassured of my affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 3, 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN HOLLINS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 5, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of April 17th came duly to hand. Nobody has\r\nregretted more sincerely than myself, the incidents which have happened\r\nat Washington. The early intimations which I saw quoted from federal\r\npapers were disregarded by me, because falsehood is their element. The\r\nfirst confirmation was from the National Intelligencer, soon followed\r\nby the exultations of other papers whose havoc is on the feelings of the\r\nvirtuous. Sincerely the friend of all the parties, I ask of none why they\r\nhave fallen out by the way, and would gladly infuse the oil and wine of\r\nthe Samaritan into all their wounds. I hope that time, the assuager of\r\nall evils, will heal these also; and I pray from them all a continuance of\r\ntheir affection, and to be permitted to bear to all the same unqualified\r\nesteem. Of one thing I am certain, that they will not suffer personal\r\ndissatisfactions to endanger the republican cause. Their principles, I\r\nknow, are far above all private considerations. And when we reflect that\r\nthe eyes of the virtuous all over the earth are turned with anxiety on\r\nus, as the only depositories of the sacred fire of liberty, and that our\r\nfalling into anarchy would decide forever the destinies of mankind, and\r\nseal the political heresy that man is incapable of self-government, the\r\nonly contest between divided friends should be who will dare farthest into\r\nthe ranks of the common enemy. With respect to Mr. Foster's mission, it\r\ncannot issue but as Rose's and Jackson's did. It can no longer be doubted\r\nthat Great Britain means to claim the ocean as her conquest, and to suffer\r\nnot even a cock-boat, as they express it, to traverse it but on paying\r\nthem a transit duty to support the very fleet which is to keep the nations\r\nunder tribute, and to rivet the yoke around their necks. Although their\r\ngovernment has never openly avowed this, yet their orders of council, in\r\ntheir original form, were founded on this principle, and I have observed\r\nfor years past, that however ill success may at times have induced them\r\nto amuse by negotiation, they have never on any occasion dropped a word\r\ndisclaiming this pretension, nor one which they would have to retract when\r\nthey shall judge the times ripe for openly asserting it. Protraction is\r\ntherefore the sole object of Foster's mission. They do not wish war with\r\nus, but will meet it rather than relinquish their purpose.\r\n\r\nWith earnest prayers to all my friends to cherish mutual good will, to\r\npromote harmony and conciliation, and above all things to let the love of\r\nour country soar above all minor passions, I tender you the assurance of\r\nmy affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 5, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor on your departure from Richmond, came to hand in due\r\ntime. Although I may not have been among the first, I am certainly with\r\nthe sincerest, who congratulate you on your entrance into the national\r\ncouncils. Your value there has never been unduly estimated by those\r\nwhom personal feelings did not misguide. The late misunderstandings at\r\nWashington have been a subject of real concern to me. I know that the\r\ndissolutions of personal friendship are among the most painful occurrences\r\nin human life. I have sincere esteem for all who have been affected by\r\nthem, having passed with them eight years of great harmony and affection.\r\nThese incidents are rendered more distressing in our country than\r\nelsewhere, because our printers ravin on the agonies of their victims,\r\nas wolves do on the blood of the lamb. But the printers and the public\r\nare very different personages. The former may lead the latter a little\r\nout of their track, while the deviation is insensible; but the moment\r\nthey usurp their direction and that of their government, they will be\r\nreduced to their true places. The two last Congresses have been the theme\r\nof the most licentious reprobation for printers thirsting after war, some\r\nagainst France and some against England. But the people wish for peace\r\nwith both. They feel no incumbency on them to become the reformers of\r\nthe other hemisphere, and to inculcate, with fire and sword, a return\r\nto moral order. When, indeed, peace shall become more losing than war,\r\nthey may owe to their interests what these Quixotes are clamoring for on\r\nfalse estimates of honor. The public are unmoved by these clamors, as\r\nthe re-election of their legislators shows, and they are firm to their\r\nexecutive on the subject of the more recent clamors.\r\n\r\nWe are suffering here, both in the gathered and the growing crop. The\r\nlowness of the river, and great quantity of produce brought to Milton this\r\nyear, render it almost impossible to get our crops to market. This is the\r\ncase of mine as well yours, and the Hessian fly appears alarmingly in our\r\ngrowing crops. Everything is in distress for the want of rain.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Monroe, and accept yourself assurances of\r\nmy constant and affectionate esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. JOHN SEVERIN VATER, PROFESSOR AT KONIGSBERG.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 11, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of November 4, 1809, did not get to my hands till\r\na twelvemonth after its date. Be pleased to accept my thanks for the\r\npublication your were pleased to send me. That for Dr. Barton I forwarded\r\nto him. His researches into the Indian languages of our continent being\r\ncontinued, I hope it will be in his power to make to you communications\r\nuseful to the object you are pursuing. This will lessen to me the regret\r\nthat my retirement into an interior part of the country, as well as\r\nmy age and little intercourse with the world, will scarcely afford me\r\nopportunities of contributing to your information. It is extremely to be\r\ndesired that your researches should receive every aid and encouragement.\r\nI have long considered the filiation of languages as the best proof\r\nwe can ever obtain of the filiation of nations. With my best wishes\r\nfor the success of your undertaking, accept the assurances of my high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COUNT POTOCKI.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 12, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received your letter of August 19th, and with it the volume\r\nof chronology you were so kind as to send me, for which be pleased\r\nto accept my thanks. It presents a happy combination of sparse and\r\nunconnected facts, which, brought together and fitted to each other,\r\nforms a whole of symmetry as well as of system. It is as a gleam of\r\nlight flashed over the dark abyss of times past. Nothing would be more\r\nflattering to me than to give aid to your inquiries as to this continent,\r\nand to weave its ancient history into the web of the old world; and with\r\nthis view, to accept the invitation to a correspondence with you on the\r\nsubject. But time tells me I am nearly done with the history of the world;\r\nthat I am now far advanced in the last chapter of my own, and that its\r\nlast verse will be read out ere a few letters could pass between St.\r\nPetersburg and Monticello. I shall serve you therefore more permanently,\r\nby bequeathing to you another correspondent, more able, more industrious,\r\nand more likely to continue in life than myself. Dr. Benjamin S. Barton,\r\none of the Professors of the college of Philadelphia, is learned in the\r\nantiquities of this country, has employed much time and attention on\r\nresearches into them, is active and punctual, and will, I think, better\r\nfulfil your wishes than any other person in the United States. If you will\r\nhave the goodness to address a letter to him on the subject, with the\r\ninquiries you wish to make, he will, I am sure, set a just value on the\r\ncorrespondence proposed, for which I shall take care to prepare him, and\r\nin committing to better hands an honor which in earlier life I should have\r\ntaken a pleasure in endeavoring to merit, I make a sacrifice of my own\r\nself-love, which is the strongest proof I can give you of the high respect\r\nand consideration of which I now tender you the assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 3d, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have seen with very great concern the late address of Mr.\r\nSmith to the public. He has been very ill-advised, both personally and\r\npublicly. As far as I can judge from what I hear, the impression made is\r\nentirely unfavorable to him. Every man's own understanding readily answers\r\nall the facts and insinuations, one only excepted, and for that they\r\nlook for explanations without any doubt that they will be satisfactory.\r\nWhat is Irving's case? I have answered the inquiries of several on this\r\nhead, telling them at the same time what was really the truth, that\r\nthe failure of my memory enabled me to give them rather conjectures\r\nthan recollections. For in truth, I have but indistinct recollections\r\nof the case. I know that what was done was on a joint consultation\r\nbetween us, and I have no fear that what we did will not have been\r\ncorrect and cautious. What I retain of the case, on being reminded of\r\nsome particulars, will reinstate the whole firmly in my remembrance, and\r\nenable me to state them to inquirers with correctness, which is the more\r\nimportant from the part I bore in them. I must therefore ask the favor\r\nof you to give me a short outline of the facts, which may correct as well\r\nas supply my own recollections. But who is to give an explanation to the\r\npublic? not yourself, certainly. The Chief Magistrate cannot enter the\r\narena of the newspapers. At least the occasion should be of a much higher\r\norder. I imagine there is some pen at Washington competent to it. Perhaps\r\nthe best form would be that of some one personating the friend of Irving,\r\nsome one apparently from the North. Nothing labored is requisite. A short\r\nand simple statement of the case will, I am sure, satisfy the public. We\r\nare in the midst of a so-so harvest, probably one-third short of the last.\r\nWe had a very fine rain on Saturday last. Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 22, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had not supposed a letter would still find you at Washington.\r\nYours by late post tells me otherwise. Those of May 2d and 15th had been\r\nreceived in due time. With respect to my books, lodged at the President's\r\nhouse, if you should see Mr. Coles, the President's Secretary, and be\r\nso good as to mention it, he will be so kind as to have them put on\r\nboard some vessel bound to Richmond, addressed to the care of Gibson\r\n& Jefferson there, whom he knows. Your doubts whether any good can\r\nbe effected with the emperor of France are too well grounded. He has\r\nunderstanding enough, but it is confined to particular lines. Of the\r\nprinciples and advantages of commerce he appears to be ignorant, and\r\nhis domineering temper deafens him moreover to the dictates of interest,\r\nof honor and of morality. A nation like ours, recognizing no arrogance\r\nof language or conduct, can never enjoy the favor of such a character.\r\nThe impression, too, which our public has been made to receive from the\r\ndifferent styles of correspondence used by two of our foreign agents, has\r\nincreased the difficulties of steering between the bristling pride of the\r\ntwo parties. It seems to point out the Quaker style of plain reason, void\r\nof offence:--the suppression of all passion, and chaste language of good\r\nsense. Heaven prosper your endeavors for our good, and preserve you in\r\nhealth and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 25, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 5th, with the volume of Montesquieu\r\naccompanying it, came to hand in due time; the latter indeed in lucky\r\ntime, as, enclosing it by the return of post, I was enabled to get it into\r\nMr. Warden's hands before his departure, for a friend abroad to whom it\r\nwill be a most acceptable offering. Of the residue of the copies I asked,\r\nI would wish to receive one well bound for my own library, the others in\r\nboards as that before sent. One of these in boards may come to me by post,\r\nfor use until the others are received, which I would prefer having sent\r\nby water, as vessels depart almost daily from Philadelphia for Richmond.\r\nMessrs. Gibson & Jefferson of that place will receive and forward the\r\npacket to me. Add to it, if you please, a copy of Franklin's works, bound,\r\nand send me by post a note of the amount of the whole, and of my newspaper\r\naccount, which has been suffered to run in arrear by the difficulty of\r\nremitting small and fractional sums to a distance, from a canton having\r\nonly its local money, and little commercial intercourse beyond its own\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nI learnt with sincere regret that my former letters had given you pain.\r\nNothing could be further from their intention. What I had said and done\r\nwas from the most friendly dispositions towards yourself, and from a\r\nzeal for maintaining the republican ascendency. Federalism, stripped\r\nas it now nearly is, of its landed and laboring support, is monarchism\r\nand Anglicism, and whenever our own dissensions shall let these in upon\r\nus, the last ray of free government closes on the horizon of the world.\r\nI have been lately reading Komarzewski's coup d'œil on the history of\r\nPoland. Though without any charms of style or composition, it gives a\r\nlesson which all our countrymen should study; the example of a country\r\nerased from the map of the world by the dissensions of its own citizens.\r\nThe papers of every day read them the counter lesson of the impossibility\r\nof subduing a people acting with an undivided will. Spain, under all her\r\ndisadvantages, physical and mental, is an encouraging example of this. She\r\nproves too, another truth not less valuable, that a people having no king\r\nto sell them for a mess of pottage for himself, no shackles to restrain\r\ntheir powers of self-defence, find resources within themselves equal to\r\nevery trial. This we did during the revolutionary war, and this we can do\r\nagain, let who will attack us, if we act heartily with one another. This\r\nis my creed. To the principles of union I sacrifice all minor differences\r\nof opinion. These, like differences of face, are a law of our nature,\r\nand should be viewed with the same tolerance. The clouds which have\r\nappeared for some time to be gathering around us, have given me anxiety\r\nlest an enemy, always on the watch, always prompt and firm, and acting in\r\nwell-disciplined phalanx, should find an opening to dissipate hopes, with\r\nthe loss of which I would wish that of life itself. To myself personally\r\nthe sufferings would be short. The powers of life have declined with me\r\nmore in the last six months than in as many preceding years. A rheumatic\r\nindisposition, under which your letter found me, has caused this delay\r\nin acknowledging its receipt, and in the expressions of regret that I\r\nhad inadvertently said or done anything which had given you uneasiness.\r\nI pray you to be assured that no unkind motive directed me, and that my\r\nsentiments of friendship and respect continue the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. OGILVIE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 4, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of May 24th was very long on its passage to me.\r\nIt gave us all pleasure to learn from yourself the progress of your\r\nperegrination, and your prospect of approaching rest for awhile, among\r\nour Western brethren--of \"rest for the body some, none for the mind.\"\r\nSo that action is said to be all its joy; and we have no more remarkable\r\nproof of it than in yourself. The newspapers have kept us informed of the\r\nsplendid course you have run, and of the flattering impressions made on\r\nthe public mind, and which must have been so grateful to yourself. The new\r\nintellectual feast you are preparing for them in your Western retirement,\r\nwill excite new appetites, and will be hailed like the returning sun,\r\nwhen he re-appears in the East. Your peripatetic enterprise, when first\r\nmade known to us, alarmed our apprehensions for you, lest the taste of\r\nthe times, and of our country, should not be up to the revival of this\r\nclassical experiment. Much to their credit, however, unshackled by the\r\nprejudices which chain down the minds of the common mass of Europe,\r\nthe experiment has proved that, where thought is free in its range, we\r\nneed never fear to hazard what is good in itself. This sample of the\r\nAmerican mind is an additional item for the flattering picture your letter\r\npresents of our situation, and our prospects. I firmly believe in them\r\nall; and that human nature has never looked forward, under circumstances\r\nso auspicious, either for the sum of happiness, or the spread of surface\r\nprovided to receive it. Very contrary opinions are inculcated in Europe,\r\nand in England especially, where I much doubt if you would be tolerated in\r\npresenting the views you propose. The English have been a wise, a virtuous\r\nand truly estimable people. But commerce and a corrupt government have\r\nrotted them to the core. Every generous, nay, every just sentiment, is\r\nabsorbed in the thirst for gold. I speak of their cities, which we may\r\ncertainly pronounce to be ripe for despotism, and fitted for no other\r\ngovernment. Whether the leaven of the agricultural body is sufficient to\r\nregenerate the residuary mass, and maintain it in a sound state, under any\r\nreformation of government, may well be doubted. Nations, like individuals,\r\nwish to enjoy a fair reputation. It is therefore desirable for us that the\r\nslanders on our country, disseminated by hired or prejudiced travellers,\r\nshould be corrected; but politics, like religion, hold up the torches of\r\nmartyrdom to the reformers of error. Nor is it in the theatre of Ephesus\r\nalone that tumults have been excited when the crafts were in danger. You\r\nmust be cautious, therefore, in telling unacceptable truths beyond the\r\nwater. You wish me to suggest any subject which occurs to myself as fit\r\nfor the rostrum. But your own selection has proved you would have been\r\naided by no counsel, and that you can best judge of the topics which open\r\nto your own mind a field for development, and promise to your hearers\r\ninstruction better adapted to the useful purposes of society, than the\r\nweekly disquisitions of their hired instructors. All the efforts of these\r\npeople are directed to the maintenance of the artificial structure of\r\ntheir craft, viewing but as a subordinate concern the inculcation of\r\nmorality. If we will be but Christians, according to their schemes of\r\nChristianity, they will compound good-naturedly with our immoralities.\r\n\r\nCannot your circuit be so shaped as to lead you through our neighborhood\r\non your return? It would give us all great pleasure to see you, if it be\r\nonly _en passant_, for after such a survey of varied country, we cannot\r\nflatter ourselves that ours would be the selected residence. But whether\r\nyou can visit us or not, I shall always be happy to hear from you, and\r\nto know that you succeed in whatever you undertake. With these assurances\r\naccept those of great esteem and respect from myself and all the members\r\nof my family.\r\n\r\nP. S. Since writing the above, an interesting subject occurs. What would\r\nyou think of a discourse on the benefit of the union and miseries which\r\nwould follow a separation of the States, to be exemplified in the eternal\r\nand wasting wars of Europe, in the pillage and profligacy to which these\r\nlead, and the abject oppression and degradation to which they reduce\r\nits inhabitants? Painted by your vivid pencil, what could make deeper\r\nimpressions, and what impressions could come more home to our concerns, or\r\nkindle a livelier sense of our present blessings?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE STEWART.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 8, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I ask the favor of you to purchase for me as much fresh timothy\r\nseed as the enclosed bill will pay for, pack and forward, and that you\r\nwill have the goodness to direct it to be lodged at Mr. Leitch's store\r\nin Charlottesville by the waggoner who brings it. You see how bold your\r\nindulgencies make me in intruding on your kindness.\r\n\r\nI do not know that the government means to make known what has passed\r\nbetween them and Foster before the meeting of Congress; but in the\r\nmeantime individuals, who are in the way, think they have a right to fish\r\nit out, and in this way the sum of it has become known. Great Britain\r\nhas certainly come forward and declared to our government by an official\r\npaper, that the conduct of France towards her during this war has obliged\r\nher to take possession of the ocean, and to determine that no commerce\r\nshall be carried on with the nations connected with France; that, however,\r\nshe is disposed to relax in this determination so far as to permit the\r\ncommerce which may be carried on through the British ports. I have, for\r\nthree or four years, been confident that, knowing that her own resources\r\nwere not adequate to the maintenance of her present navy, she meant with\r\nit to claim the conquest of the ocean, and to permit no nation to navigate\r\nit, but on payment of a tribute for the maintenance of the fleet necessary\r\nto secure that dominion. A thousand circumstances brought together left\r\nme without a doubt that that policy directed all her conduct, although\r\nnot avowed. This is the first time she has thrown off the mask. The answer\r\nand conduct of the government have been what they ought to have been, and\r\nCongress is called a little earlier, to be ready to act on the receipt of\r\nthe reply, for which time has been given.\r\n\r\nGod bless you. From yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                            POPLAR FOREST, August 14, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL AND FRIEND,-- * * * * *\r\n\r\nI am happy to learn that your own health is good, and I hope it will\r\nlong continue so. The friends we left behind us have fallen out by the\r\nway. I sincerely lament it, because I sincerely esteem them all, and\r\nbecause it multiplies schisms where harmony is safety. As far as I have\r\nbeen able to judge, however, it has made no sensible impression against\r\nthe government. Those who were murmuring before are a little louder now;\r\nbut the mass of our citizens is firm and unshaken. It furnishes, as an\r\nincident, another proof that they are perfectly equal to the purposes of\r\nself-government, and that we have nothing to fear for its stability. The\r\nspirit, indeed, which manifests itself among the tories of your quarter,\r\nalthough I believe there is a majority there sufficient to keep it down\r\nin peaceable times, leaves me not without some disquietude. Should the\r\ndetermination of England, now formally expressed, to take possession of\r\nthe ocean, and to suffer no commerce on it but through her ports, force a\r\nwar upon us, I foresee a possibility of a separate treaty between her and\r\nyour Essex men, on the principles of neutrality and commerce. Pickering\r\nhere, and his nephew Williams there, can easily negotiate this. Such a\r\nlure to the quietists in our ranks with you, might recruit theirs to a\r\nmajority. Yet, excluded as they would be from intercourse with the rest\r\nof the Union and of Europe, I scarcely see the gain they would propose to\r\nthemselves, even for the moment. The defection would certainly disconcert\r\nthe other States, but it could not ultimately endanger their safety. They\r\nare adequate, in all points, to a defensive war. However, I hope your\r\nmajority, with the aid it is entitled to, will save us from this trial,\r\nto which I think it possible we are advancing. The death of George may\r\ncome to our relief; but I fear the dominion of the sea is the insanity of\r\nthe nation itself also. Perhaps, if some stroke of fortune were to rid us\r\nat the same time from the Mammoth of the land as well as the Leviathan\r\nof the ocean, the people of England might lose their fears, and recover\r\ntheir sober senses again. Tell my old friend, Governor Gerry, that I gave\r\nhim glory for the rasping with which he rubbed down his herd of traitors.\r\nLet them have justice and protection against personal violence, but no\r\nfavor. Powers and preëminences conferred on them are daggers put into the\r\nhands of assassins, to be plunged into our own bosoms in the moment the\r\nthrust can go home to the heart. Moderation can never reclaim them. They\r\ndeem it timidity, and despise without fearing the tameness from which\r\nit flows. Backed by England, they never lose the hope that their day is\r\nto come, when the terrorism of their earlier power is to be merged in\r\nthe more gratifying system of deportation and the guillotine. Being now\r\n_hors de combat_ myself, I resign to others these cares. A long attack\r\nof rheumatism has greatly enfeebled me, and warns me that they will not\r\nvery long be within my ken. But you may have to meet the trial, and in\r\nthe focus of its fury. God send you a safe deliverance, a happy issue out\r\nof all afflictions, personal and public, with long life, long health, and\r\nfriends as sincerely attached as yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOL.
