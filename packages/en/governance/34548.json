In those last months of\r\nfighting some progress had been made with the reconstruction--at least\r\nwith that not unimportant branch of it which is concerned with the\r\nmachinery of government. A working administration had been put\r\ntogether, new ordinances in the form of proclamations had been issued,\r\ndepartments had been created and the chief appointments made, the gold\r\nindustry was beginning to set its house in order, refugees were\r\nreturning, and already political theories were being mooted and future\r\nparties foreshadowed. But it is from the conclusion of peace that the\r\nwork of resettlement may fairly be taken to commence. Before that date\r\nthe restrictions of war limited all civil activity; not till the\r\nshackles were removed and the civil power left in sole possession does\r\na fair field appear either for approval or criticism.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to write the history of the reconstruction. The\r\nwork is still in process, and a decade later it may be formally\r\ncompleted. Fifty years hence it may be possible to look back and\r\ndiscriminate on its success or failure. The history when it is written\r\nwill be an interesting book. It will among other matters deal with the\r\nwork of repatriation, one of the most curious and quixotic burdens\r\never borne by a nation, and one, I believe, to which no real parallel\r\ncan be found. It will concern itself with the slow and difficult\r\ntransference from military to civil government, the renascence of the\r\ncommon law, the first revival of trade and industry, the restitution\r\nof prisoners, and the return of refugees--all matters of interest and\r\nnovel precedents in our history. It will recognise more clearly than\r\nis at present possible the problems which faced South Africa at the\r\ntime, and it will be in the happy position of judging from the high\r\nstandpoint of accomplished fact. But in the meantime, when we have\r\nseen barely eighteen months of reconstruction, history is out of the\r\nquestion. Yet even in the stress of work it is often sound policy for\r\na man to halt for a moment and collect his thoughts. There must be\r\nsome diagnosis of the problem before him, the end to which his work is\r\ndirected, the conditions under which he labours. While it is useless\r\nto tell the story of a task before it is done, it is often politic to\r\nre-examine the difficulties and to get the mind clear as to what the\r\nobject of all this strife and expense of money and energy may be.\r\nIdeals are all very well in their way, but they are apt to become\r\nvery dim lamps unless often replenished from the world of facts and\r\ntrimmed and adjusted by wholesome criticism.\r\n\r\nSuch a modest diagnosis is the aim of the present work. I have tried\r\nin the main to state as clearly as I could the outstanding problems of\r\nSouth African politics as they appear to one observer. I say \"in the\r\nmain,\" because I am aware that I have been frequently led against my\r\nintention to express an opinion on more than one such problem, and in\r\nseveral cases to suggest a policy. I can only plead that it is almost\r\nimpossible to keep a statement of a case uncoloured by one's own view\r\nof the solution, and that it is better to give frankly a judgment,\r\nhowever worthless, than to allow a bias to influence insensibly the\r\npresentation of facts. For such views, which are my own, I claim no\r\nvalue; for facts, in so far as they are facts, I hope I may beg some\r\nlittle attention. They are the fruit of first-hand, and, I trust,\r\nhonest observation. Every statement of a case is, indeed, a personal\r\none, representing the writer's own estimate rather than objective\r\ntruth, but in all likelihood it is several degrees nearer the truth\r\nthan the same writer's policies or prophecies. South Africa has been\r\nin the world's eye for half a century, and in the last few years her\r\nproblems have been so complex that it has been difficult to separate\r\nthe permanent from the transitory, or to look beyond the mass of local\r\ndifficulties to the abiding needs of the sub-continent as a whole.\r\nColonial opinion has been neglected at home; English opinion has been\r\nmisunderstood in the colonies. It may be of interest to try to\r\nestimate her chief needs and to understand her thoughts, for it is\r\nonly thus that we can forecast that future which she and she alone\r\nmust make for herself.\r\n\r\nEvery one who approaches the consideration of the politics of a\r\ncountry which is not his own, and in which he is at best a stranger,\r\nmust feel a certain diffidence. On many matters it is impossible that\r\nhe should judge correctly. What seems to him a simple fact is\r\ncomplicated, it may be, by a thousand unseen local currents which no\r\none can allow for except the old inhabitant. For this reason an\r\noutside critic will be wrong in innumerable details, and even, it is\r\nprobable, in certain broad questions of principle. But aloofness may\r\nhave the qualities of its defects. A critic on a neighbouring hill-top\r\nwill be a poor guide to the flora and fauna of the parish below; but\r\nhe may be a good authority on its contours, on the height of its hills\r\nand the number of its rivers, and he may, perhaps, be a better judge\r\nof the magnitude of a thunderstorm coming out of the west than the\r\nparishioner in his garden. The insistence of certain South African\r\nproblems, familiar to us all, has made any synthetic survey difficult\r\nfor the South African and impossible for the newspaper reader at home.\r\nWe have forgotten that it is a country with a history, that it is a\r\nland where men can live as well as wrangle and fight, that it has\r\nsport, traditions, charm of scenery and weather; and in its politics\r\nwe are apt to see the problems under a few popular categories, rather\r\nas a war of catchwords than the birth-pangs of a people. I have\r\nattempted in the following pages to give this synthesis at the\r\nexpense, I am afraid, of completeness of detail. It is my hope that\r\nsome few readers may find utility even in an imperfect general survey\r\nas a corrective and a supplement to the many able expositions of\r\nsingle problems.\r\n\r\nThe title begs a question which it is the aim of the later chapters to\r\nanswer. South Africa is in reality one colony, and it can only be a\r\nmatter of years till this radical truth is formally recognised in a\r\nfederation. But some explanation is necessary for the fact that most\r\nof the book is occupied with a discussion of the new colonies and with\r\nproblems which, for the present, may seem to exist only for them. At\r\nthis moment the settlement of the Transvaal and the Orange River\r\nColony is the most vital South African problem. On their success or\r\nfailure depends the whole future of the sub-continent. They show, not\r\nin embryo, but in the strongest light and the clearest and most mature\r\nform, every South African question. On them depends the future wealth\r\nof the country and any marked increase in its population. They will be\r\nforced by their position to be in the van of South African progress,\r\nand to give the lead in new methods of expansion and development. We\r\nare therefore fortunate in possessing in the politics of these\r\ncolonies an isolated and focussed observation-ground, a page where we\r\ncan read in large clear type what is elsewhere blurred and written\r\nover. I do not suppose that this fact would be denied by any of the\r\nneighbouring colonies; indeed the tendency in those states is to\r\nmanifest an undue interest in the affairs of the Transvaal, and to see\r\noften, in matters which are purely local, questions of far-reaching\r\nSouth African interest. On the ultimate dominance of the Transvaal\r\nopinion naturally differs, and indeed it is a point not worth\r\ninsisting on, save as a further argument for federation. If South\r\nAfrican interests are so inextricably intertwined, it is clearly\r\ndesirable to have a colony, whose future is obscure but whose wealth\r\nand power are at least potentially very great, brought formally into a\r\nunion where each colony will be one unit and no more, rather than\r\nallow it to exist in isolation, unamenable to advice from sister\r\nstates and wholly self-centred and unsympathetic. It is sufficient\r\njustification for the method I have employed if it is admitted that\r\nthe Transvaal question is the South African problem in its most\r\ncomplete and characteristic form.\r\n\r\nA word remains to be said on the arrangement of the chapters. I have\r\ntried to write what is a kind of guide-book, not to details, but to\r\nthe constituents of that national life which is now in process of\r\ngrowth. The reader I have had in mind is the average Englishman who,\r\nin seeking to be informed about a country, asks for something more\r\nthan the dry bones of statistics--_l'homme moyen politique_, who wants\r\na _resume_ of the political problem, some guide to the historical\r\ninfluences which have been or are still potent, an idea of landscape\r\nand national character and modes of life. He does not ask for a\r\nhistory, nor does he want a disquisition on this or that question, or\r\na brief for this or that policy, but, being perfectly competent to\r\nmake up his own mind, he wants the materials for judgment. The first\r\npart consists of brief historical sketches, dealing with the genesis\r\nof the three populations--native, uitlander, and Boer. The history of\r\nSouth Africa, with all deference to the learned and voluminous works\r\nof Dr Theal, can never be adequately written. Her past appears to us\r\nin a series of vanishing pictures, without continuity or connection. I\r\nhave therefore avoided any attempt at a consecutive tale, as I have\r\navoided such topics as the War and the negotiations preceding it, and\r\ntreated a few historical influences in a brief episodic form. In the\r\nsecond part the configuration of the land has been dealt with in a\r\nsimilar way. A series of short sketches, of the class which the French\r\ncall \"_carnets de voyage_,\" seemed more suitable than any attempt at\r\nthe work of a gazetteer. I am so convinced of the beauty and\r\nhealthfulness of the land that I may have been betrayed into an\r\nover-minute description: my one excuse is that in this branch of my\r\ntask I have had few predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe third part is highly controversial in character, and is presented\r\nwith grave hesitation. Many books and pamphlets have informed us on\r\nthose years of South African history between the Raid and the Ultimatum,\r\nand a still greater number have discussed every phase and detail of the\r\nwar. Another book on so hackneyed a matter may seem hard to justify. It\r\nmay be urged, however, that the question has taken a wholly different\r\nform. Of late years it has been complicated by a division of opinion\r\nbased not only on political but on moral grounds, an opposition in\r\ntheories of national duty, of international ethics, of civic integrity.\r\nSouth African policy before the war and during the actual conduct of\r\nhostilities was by a considerable section of the English people not\r\njudged on political grounds, but condemned or applauded in the one case\r\non moral pretexts and in the other on the common grounds of patriotism.\r\nThe danger of making the moral criterion bulk aggressively in politics\r\nis that the criticism so desirable for all policies is neglected or\r\nperfunctorily performed. Matters which, to be judged truly, must be\r\ntried by the canons of the province to which they belong, are hastily\r\napproved or as hastily damned on some wholly alien test. But with the\r\nend of the war and the beginning of civil government it seems to me that\r\nthis vice must tend to disappear. Whatever our judgment on the past,\r\nthere is a living and insistent problem for the present. Whatever the\r\nverdict on our efforts to meet the problem, it must be based on\r\npolitical grounds. We are now in a position to criticise, if not\r\nadequately, at least fairly and on a logical basis. But the old data\r\nrequire revision. The war has been a chemical process which has so\r\nchanged the nature of the old constituents that they are unrecognisable\r\nin a new analysis. I am encouraged to hope that a sketch of the\r\npolitical problem as it has to be faced in South Africa to-day will not\r\nbe without a certain value to those who desire to inform themselves on\r\nwhat is the most interesting of modern imperial experiments. It is too\r\noften assumed in England that the real difficulties preceded war, and\r\nthat the course of policy, though not unattended with risks, is now\r\ncomparatively clear and easy. It would be truer to say that the real\r\ndifficulty has only now begun. I shall be satisfied if I can convince\r\nsome of my readers that the work to be done in South Africa is\r\nexceedingly delicate and arduous, requiring a high measure of judgment\r\nand tact and patience; that it is South Africa's own problem which she\r\nmust settle for herself; and above all, that while the result of success\r\nwill be more far-reaching and vital to the future of the English race\r\nthan is commonly realised, the consequences of failure will be wholly\r\ndisastrous to any vision of Empire.\r\n\r\nTo my friends in South Africa I owe an apology for my audacity in\r\nundertaking to pronounce upon a country of which my experience is\r\nlimited. Had I not always found them ready to welcome outside\r\ncriticism, however imperfect, when honestly made, and to hear with\r\ncommendable patience a newcomer's views, however crude, I should have\r\nhesitated long before making the attempt. I have endeavoured to give a\r\nplain statement of local opinion, which is expert opinion, and\r\ntherefore worthy of the first consideration, and, though there are\r\nphases of it with which I am not in sympathy, I trust I may claim to\r\nhave given on many matters the colonial view, when such a view has\r\nattained consistency and clearness. But my chief excuse is that while\r\nlocal opinion is still in the making, and politics are still in the\r\nflux which attends a reconstruction, the outside spectator may in all\r\nmodesty claim to have a voice. It may be easier for a man coming fresh\r\nto a new world to judge it correctly than for those ex-inhabitants of\r\nthat older world on whose wreckage the new is built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are kinds of history which a modern education ignores, and which\r\na modern mind is hardly trained to understand. We can interest\r\nourselves keenly in the first vagaries of embryo humankind; and for\r\nsavagery, which is a hunting-ground for the sociologist and the\r\nfolk-lorist, we have an academic respect. But for savagery naked and\r\nnot ashamed, fighting its own battles and ruling its own peoples, we\r\nreserve an interest only when it reaches literary record in a saga.\r\nOtherwise it is for us neither literature nor history--a kind of\r\nnatural event like a thunderstorm, of possible political importance,\r\nbut of undoubted practical dulness. Most men have never heard of\r\nVechtkop or Mosega, and know Tchaka and Dingaan and Moshesh only as\r\nbarbarous names. And yet this is a history of curious interest and\r\nfar-reaching significance: the chronicle of Tchaka's deeds is an epic,\r\nand we still feel the results of his iron arguments. The current\r\nattitude is part of a general false conception of South African\r\nconditions. To most men she is a country without history, or, if she\r\nhas a certain barbarous chronicle, it is without significance. The\r\ntruth is nearly at the opposite pole. South Africa is bound to the\r\nchariot-wheels of her past, and that past is intricately varied--a\r\nmuseum of the wrecks of conquerors and races, joining hands with most\r\nquarters of the Old World. More, it is the place where savagery is\r\nmost intimately linked with latter-day civilisation. Phoenician,\r\nArab, Portuguese, Dutch, and English--that is her Uitlander cycle; and\r\na cynic might say that she has ended as she began, with the Semitic.\r\nAnd meantime there were great native conquests surging in the interior\r\nwhile the adventurer was nibbling at her coasts; and when we were busy\r\nin one quarter abolishing slavery and educating the Kaffir, in another\r\nthere were wars more bloody than Timour's, and annihilation of races\r\nmore terrible than Attila ever dreamed of. We see, before our faces,\r\n\"the rudiments of tiger and baboon, and know that the barriers of\r\nraces are not so firm but that spray can sprinkle us from antediluvian\r\nseas.\"\r\n\r\nTo realise this intricate history and its modern meaning is the first\r\nSouth African problem. No man can understand the land unless he takes\r\nit as it is, a place instinct with tradition, where every problem is\r\nbased upon the wreckage of old strifes. And to the mere amateur the\r\nquestion is full of interest. The history of South Africa can never be\r\nwritten. The materials are lost, and all we possess are fleeting\r\nglimpses, outcrops of fact on the wide plains of tradition, random\r\nguesses, stray relics which suggest without enlightening. We see races\r\nemerge and vanish, with a place-name or a tomb as their only memorial;\r\nbut bequeathing something, we know not what, to the land and their\r\nsuccessors. And at the end of the roll come the first white masters of\r\nthe land, the Dutch, whom it is impossible to understand except in\r\nrelation to the country which they conquered and the people they\r\nsuperseded. We have unthinkingly set down one of the most curious\r\nside-products of the human family as a common race of emigrants, and\r\nthe result has been one long tale of misapprehension. It is this\r\noverlapping of counter-civilisations, this mosaic of the prehistoric\r\nand the recent, which gives South African history its piquancy and its\r\ncharacter. It is no tale of old populous cities and splendid empires,\r\nno story of developing civilisations and conflicting philosophies;\r\nonly a wild half-heard legend of men who come out of the darkness for\r\na moment, of shapes warring in a mist for centuries, till the curtain\r\nlifts and we recognise the faces of to-day.\r\n\r\nTwo views have been held on the subject of the present native\r\npopulation. One is that it represents the end of a long line of\r\ndevelopment; the other that it is the nadir of a process of\r\nretrogression. The supporters of the second view point to the growing\r\nweakness of all Kaffir languages in inflexions and structural forms,\r\nwhile in the Hottentot-Bushman survival they see a degeneration from\r\na more masculine type. It is impossible to dogmatise on such a\r\nmatter. Degeneration and advance are not fixed processes, but recur\r\nin cycles in the history of every nation. The Bushman, one of the\r\nlowest of created types, may well be the original creature of the\r\nsoil, advancing in halting stages from the palaeolithic man; himself\r\npractically a being of the Stone Age, and prohibited from further\r\nprogress by an arid and unfriendly land, and the advent of stronger\r\nraces. Of the palaeolithic man, who 200,000 years ago or thereabout\r\nmade his home in the river drifts, we have geological records similar\r\nto those found in the valleys of the Somme and the Thames. On the\r\nbanks of the Buffalo at East London, in a gravel deposit 70 feet\r\nabove the present river-bed, there have been found rude human\r\nimplements of greenstone, the age of which may be measured by the\r\ntime the river has taken to wear down 70 feet of hard greenstone\r\ndyke.[1] From the palaeolithic it is a step of a few millenniums to\r\nthe neolithic man, who has left his relics in the shell-heaps and\r\nkitchen-middens at the mouth of the same stream--who, indeed, till a\r\nfew generations ago was an inhabitant of the land. The Bushman was a\r\ndweller in the Stone Age, for, though he knew a little about metals,\r\nstone implements were in daily use, and, with his kinsmen the Pigmies\r\nof Central Africa, he represented a savagery compared with which the\r\nKaffir races are civilised. It is his skull which is found in the\r\nshell-heaps by the river-sides. He was a miserable fellow, a true\r\ntroglodyte, small, emaciated, with protruding chest and spindle legs.\r\nHe lived by hunting of the most primitive kind, killing game with his\r\npoisoned arrows. He had no social organisation, no knowledge of\r\nhusbandry or stock-keeping, and save for his unrivalled skill in\r\nfollowing spoor and a rude elementary art which is shown in the\r\nBushman pictures on some of the rocks in the western districts, he\r\nwas scarcely to be distinguished from the beasts he hunted. A genuine\r\nneolithic man, and therefore worthy of all attention. In other lands\r\nhis wild contemporaries have gone; in South Africa the elephant, the\r\nrhinoceros, and the buffalo survive to give the background to our\r\npicture of his life. He himself has perished, or all but perished.\r\nThe Dutch farmers hunted him down and shot him at sight, for indeed\r\nhe was untamable. His blood has probably mixed with the Hottentot and\r\nthe Koranna; and in some outland parts of the Kalahari and the great\r\nwastes along the lower Orange he may survive in twos and threes.\r\n\r\nOriginally he covered all the south-west corner of Africa, but in time\r\nhe had to retire from the richer coast lands in favour of a people a\r\nlittle higher in the scale of civilisation. The origin of the\r\nHottentots is shrouded in utter mystery, but we find them in\r\npossession when the first Portuguese and Dutch explorers reached the\r\ncoast. They, too, were an insignificant race, but so far an advance\r\nupon their predecessors that they were shepherds, owning large herds\r\nof sheep and horned cattle, and roaming over wide tracts in search of\r\npasture. They had a tribal organisation, and a certain domesticity of\r\nnature which, while it made them an easy prey to warrior tribes,\r\nenabled them to live side by side with the Dutch immigrants as\r\nherdsmen and house-servants. The pure breed disappeared, but their\r\nblood remains in the Cape boy, that curious mixed race part white,\r\npart Malay, part Hottentot. Both Bushman and Hottentot, having within\r\nthem no real vitality, have perished utterly as peoples: in Emerson's\r\nwords, they \"had guano in their destiny,\" and were fated only to\r\nprepare the way for their successors.\r\n\r\nFor the rest the history of primitive South Africa is a history of the\r\nBantu tribes but for one curious exception. In the districts now\r\nincluded in the general name of Rhodesia, stretching from the Zambesi to\r\nthe Limpopo, we find authentic record of an old and mysterious\r\ncivilisation compared with which all African empires, save Egypt, are\r\nthings of yesterday. Over five hundred ruins, showing in the main one\r\ntype, though a type which can be differentiated in stages, are hidden\r\namong the hollows and stony hills of that curious country. Livingstone\r\nand Baines first called the world's attention to those monuments, and Mr\r\nBent, in his 'Ruined Cities of Mashonaland,' provided the first working\r\ntheory of their origin. Since that date many savants, from Dr Schlichter\r\nto Professor Keane, have elaborated the hypothesis, for in the present\r\nstate of our knowledge a hypothesis it remains. In those ruins, or\r\nZimbabwes, to use the generic Bantu name, three distinct periods have\r\nbeen traced, and a fourth period, when it is supposed that local tribes\r\nbegan to imitate the Zimbabwe style of architecture. The features of\r\nthis architecture are simple, and consist chiefly of immense thickness\r\nof wall ornamented with a herring-bone, a chess-board, and in a few\r\ninstances a diaper pattern, enclosures entered by narrow winding\r\npassages, and in some cases conical towers similar to the Sardinian\r\n_nauraghes_. The discoveries by excavation have not been many, mainly\r\nfragments of gold and gold-dust, certain bowls of soapstone and wood\r\nornamented with geometrical patterns and figures which may represent the\r\nsigns of the zodiac, some curious figures of birds, stone objects which\r\nmay be _phalli_, and rude stones which may be the sacred _betyli_. It is\r\ndifficult to judge of the purpose of the buildings. Some suggest forts,\r\nsome temples, some factories, some palaces: perhaps they may be all\r\ncombined, such as we know the early Ionian and Phoenician adventurers\r\nbuilt in a new land.\r\n\r\nFrom the remains themselves little light comes, but we have a certain\r\nassistance from known history. In early days, before the Phoenicians\r\ncame to the Mediterranean seaboard, their precursors, the Sabaeo-Arabians\r\nor Himyarites of South Arabia, were the great commercial people of the\r\nEast. There was undoubtedly a large trade in gold and ivory with Africa,\r\nand all records point to somewhere on the Mozambique coast as the port\r\nfrom which the precious metal was shipped. The only place whence gold in\r\ngreat quantities could have come is the central tableland of Rhodesia,\r\nfrom which it has been estimated that the ancient output was of the\r\nvalue of at least 75 millions. The temple of Haram of Bilkis, near\r\nMarib, as described by Mueller, has an extraordinary resemblance both in\r\narchitecture and the relics found in it to the Great Zimbabwe. According\r\nto Professor Keane, the Sabaeans reached Rhodesia by way of Madagascar,\r\nand he finds in the Malagasy language traces of their presence. Ophir he\r\nplaces in the south of Arabia, the emporium to which the gold was\r\nbrought for distribution; Tarshish, the port of embarkation, he\r\nidentifies with Sofala; and he finds in Rhodesia the ancient Havilah.\r\nOthers place Ophir in Rhodesia itself. According to the Portuguese\r\nwriter Conto, Mount Fura in Rhodesia was called by the Arabs Afur, and\r\nsome see in the names of Sofala and the Sabi river a reference to Ophir\r\nand Sheba. Etymological proofs are always suspicious, save in cases like\r\nthis where they are merely supplementary to a vast quantity of\r\ncollateral evidence. When the Phoenicians succeeded to the commercial\r\nempire of the Sabaeans, they took over the land of Ophir, and to them the\r\nbulk of the Zimbabwes are to be attributed. Those later Zimbabwes and\r\nthe Sardinian _nauraghes_, which are almost certainly Phoenician in\r\norigin, have many points of resemblance. The traces of litholatry and\r\nphallic worship are Phoenician, the soapstone birds may be the vultures\r\nof Astarte, and the rosette decorations on the stone cylinders are found\r\nin the Phoenician temple of Paphos and the great temple of the Sun at\r\nEmesa.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of the proofs advanced on behalf of a hypothesis which\r\nis in itself highly probable.[2] It is not a history of generations\r\nbut of aeons, and we cannot tell what were the fortunes of that\r\nmysterious land from the days when the Phoenician power dwindled\r\naway to the time when the Portuguese discovered the gold mines and\r\nframed wild legends about Monomotapa. The most probable theory is that\r\nthe old Semitic settlers mingled their blood with the people of the\r\nland, and as the trade outlets became closed a native tribe took the\r\nplace of the proud Phoenician merchants. In the words of Mr Selous,\r\n\"the blood of the ancient builders of Zimbabwe still runs, in a very\r\ndiluted form, in the veins of the Bantu races, and more especially\r\namong the remnants of the tribes still living in Mashonaland and the\r\nBarotsi of the Upper Zambesi.\" The Makalanga, or Children of the Sun,\r\nwhom Barreto fought, were in the line of succession from the\r\nPhoenicians, as the Mashonas are their representatives to-day. In\r\nMashona pottery we can still trace the decorations, which are found on\r\nthe walls of the Zimbabwes: the people have something Semitic in their\r\nfeatures, as compared with other Bantu tribes; they know something of\r\ngold-working, a little of astronomy, and in their industries and\r\nbeliefs have a higher culture than their neighbours. Their chiefs have\r\ndynastic names; each tribe has a form of totemism in which some have\r\nseen Arabian influences; and in certain matters of religion, such as\r\nthe sacrifice of black bulls and the observation of days of rest, they\r\nsuggest Semitic customs. So, if this hypothesis be true, we are\r\npresented with a survival of the oldest of civilisations in the heart\r\nof modern barbarism. The traveller, who sees in the wilds of\r\nManicaland a sacrifice of oxen to the Manes of the tribe, sees in a\r\ncrude imitation the rites which the hook-nosed, dark-eyed adventurers\r\nbrought from the old splendid cities of the Mediterranean, where with\r\nwild music and unspeakable cruelties and lusts the votaries of Baal\r\nand Astarte celebrated the cycle of the seasons and the mysteries of\r\nthe natural world--\r\n\r\n    \"Imperishable fire under the boughs\r\n    Of chrysoberyl and beryl and chrysolite\r\n    And chrysoprase and ruby and sardonyx.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Portuguese first landed in East Africa the chief tribe with\r\nwhich they came in contact was the Makalanga in Mashonaland, ruled by\r\nthe Monomotapa. But before their power waned they had seen that nation\r\nvanquished and scattered by the attacks of fiercer tribes from the\r\nnorth, particularly the Mazimba, in whose name there may lurk a trace\r\nof the Agizymba, a country to which, according to Ptolemy, the Romans\r\npenetrated. For the last four centuries native South Africa has been\r\nthe theatre of a continuous _voelkerwanderung_, immigrations from the\r\nnorth, and in consequence a general displacement, so that no tribe can\r\nclaim an ancient possession of its territory. We may detect, apart\r\nfrom the Mashonas, three chief race families among the Bantus--the\r\nOvampas and people of German South Africa; the Bechuanas and Basutos;\r\nand the great mixed race of which the Zulus and the Kaffirs of Eastern\r\nCape Colony are the chief representatives. All the groups show a\r\nstrong family likeness in customs, worship, and physical character.\r\nAs a rule the men are tall and well-formed, and their features are\r\nmore shapely than the ordinary negro of West Africa or the far\r\ninterior. They have a knowledge of husbandry and some skill in\r\nmetal-working; they have often shown remarkable courage in the field\r\nand a kind of rude discipline; and they dwell in a society which is\r\nrigidly, if crudely, organised. The Custom of the Ancients is the main\r\nrule in their lives, and such law as they possess owes its sanction to\r\nthis authority. The family is the social unit; and families are\r\ncombined into clans, and clans into tribes, with one paramount chief\r\nat the head, whose power in most instances is despotic, as becomes a\r\nmilitary chief. In some of the tribes, notably the Bechuana-Basuto, we\r\nfind rudiments of popular government, where the chief has to take the\r\nadvice of the assembled people, as in the Basuto _pitso_, or, in a few\r\ncases, of a council of the chief indunas. The chief's authority as\r\nlawgiver is absolute, but his judgments are supposed to be only\r\ndeclaratory of ancient custom. Socially the tribes are polygamous, and\r\nsexual morality is low, though certain crimes are reprobated and\r\nseverely punished. The prevailing religion is ancestor-worship, joined\r\nwith a rude form of natural daemonism. The ordinary Bantu is not an\r\nidolater like the Makalanga, but he walks in terror of unseen spirits\r\nwhich dwell in the woods and rivers,--the ghost of his father it may\r\nbe, or some unattached devils. Ghost feasts are made at stated times\r\non the graves of the dead; and if the ghost has been whimsical enough\r\nto enter the body of an animal, that animal must be jealously\r\nrespected. Each tribe has its totem--the lion, or the antelope, or the\r\ncrocodile--from which they derive their descent, one of the commonest\r\nfeatures of all primitive societies. There seem traces of a vague\r\nbelief in a superior deity, who makes rain and thunder and controls\r\nthe itinerant bands of ghosts--a great ghost, who, if properly\r\nsupplicated, may intercede with the smaller and more troublesome herd.\r\nBut abstractions are essentially foreign to the Bantu mind, and his\r\nmodest Pantheon is filled with the simplest of deities.\r\n\r\nNo priesthood exists, but it is possible for a clever man to learn\r\nsome of the tricks of disembodied spirits and frustrate them by his\r\nown skill. In this way a class of sorcerers arose, who dealt in big\r\nmedicine and strong magic. They profess to make rain and receive\r\ncommunications from the unseen, to cure diseases and give increase to\r\nthe flocks, to expound the past and foretell the future. This powerful\r\nclass is jealous of amateurs, and does its best to remove inferior\r\nwizards; but they are always liable to be annihilated themselves by a\r\npowerful chief, who is more bloodthirsty than superstitious.\r\nUndoubtedly some of these sorcerers acquire a knowledge of certain\r\nnatural secrets; they become skilled meteorologists, and seem to\r\npossess a crude knowledge of hypnotism. They are also physicians of\r\nconsiderable attainments, and certain native remedies, notably a\r\ndistillation of herbs, which is used for dysentery in Swaziland, have\r\na claim to a place in a civilised pharmacopoeia. This rough science is\r\nthe only serious intellectual attainment of the Bantu, outside of\r\nwarfare. They have a kind of music which is extremely doleful and\r\nmonotonous; they have a rude art, chiefly employed in the decoration\r\nof their weapons; but they have no poetry worthy of the name; and\r\ntheir only literature is found in certain simple folk-tales, chiefly\r\nof animals, but in a few cases of human escapades and feats of\r\nsorcery. The lion is generally the butt of such stories, and the\r\nquick wit of the hare and the knavery of the jackal are held up to the\r\nadmiration of the listeners.[3]\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief features of Bantu life, and so lived the natives of\r\nSouth Africa up to the early years of last century. But about that\r\ntime a certain Dingiswayo, being in exile at Cape Town, saw a company\r\nof British soldiers at drill, and, being an intelligent man, acquired\r\na new idea of the art of war. When he returned to his home and the\r\nchieftainship of the little Zulu tribe, the memory of the soldiers in\r\nshakos, who moved as one man, remained with him, and he began to\r\nexperiment with his army. He died, and his lieutenant Tchaka succeeded\r\nto the command of a small but well-disciplined force. This Tchaka was\r\none of those born leaders of men in battle who appear on the stage of\r\nhistory every century or so. He perfected the discipline of his army,\r\narmed it with short stabbing spears for close-quarter fighting, and\r\nthen proceeded to use it as a wedge to split the large loose masses\r\nwhich surrounded him. It was a war of the eagle and the crows.\r\nNeighbouring tribes awoke one morning to find the enemy at their\r\ngates, and by the evening they had ceased to exist. A wild flight to\r\nthe north began, and for years the wastes north and east of the\r\nDrakensberg were littered with flying remnants of broken clans. All\r\nthe great deeds of savage warfare--the killing of the Suitors, the\r\nfight in the Great Hall of Worms, Cuchulain's doings in the war of the\r\nBull of Cuailgne--pale before the barbaric splendours of Tchaka's\r\nslaughterings, the Zulus became the imperial power of South-East\r\nAfrica, and their monarch's authority was limited only by the length\r\nof his impis' reach. By-and-by his career of storm ceases. We find him\r\nruling as a severe and much-venerated king, arbitrary and bloodthirsty\r\nbut comparatively honest; a huge man, with many large vices and a few\r\nglimmerings of virtue. He was succeeded by his brother, the monstrous\r\nDingaan, who was soundly beaten by the Boers in one of the most heroic\r\nbattles in history; he in turn gave way to his brother Panda, a figure\r\nof small note; and the dynasty ended with Cetewayo and the blood and\r\nterror of Isandhlwana and Ulundi.\r\n\r\nAfter Tchaka the man who looms largest in the tale of those wars is\r\nMosilikatse, the founder of the Matabele. The Zulu conquests placed\r\nterrible autocrats on the throne, and the marshal who incurred the\r\nking's displeasure had to flee or perish. To this circumstance we owe\r\nthe Angoni in Nyassaland and the empire of Lobengula. About 1817\r\nMosilikatse with his impi burst into what is now the Orange River\r\nColony, driving before him the feeble Barolong and Bechuana tribes,\r\nand established his court at a place on the Crocodile River north of\r\nthe Magaliesberg, where a pass still bears his name. He began a career\r\nof wholesale rapine and slaughter, till, as Fate would have it, he\r\ncame in contact with the pioneers of the Great Trek. Some hideous\r\nmassacres were the result, but he had to deal with an enemy against\r\nwhom his race could never hope to stand. The Boers, under Uys and\r\nPotgieter, drove him from his kraal, impounded his ill-gotten cattle,\r\nand finally, in a great battle on the Marico River, defeated him so\r\nthoroughly that he fled north of the Limpopo and left the country for\r\never. From the little we know of him he was a cruel and treacherous\r\nchief, inferior in strength to Tchaka, as he was utterly inferior to\r\nMoshesh in statesmanship. But the men he led had the true Zulu\r\nfighting spirit, and in the Matabele, under his son Lobengula, we have\r\nlearned something of the warriors of Mosilikatse.\r\n\r\nA throne which, as with the Zulus and their offshoots, had no strong\r\nreligious sanction, must subsist either by continued success in battle\r\nor a studious statesmanship. Tchaka is an instance of the first;\r\nMoshesh, the founder of the Basuto power, is a signal example of the\r\nsecond. The Basutos were driven down from the north by the Zulu\r\nadvance, and found shelter in the wild tangle of mountains which\r\ncradle the infant Orange and Caledon rivers. Moshesh, who had no\r\nhereditary claim to a throne, won his power by his own abilities, and\r\non the mountain of Thaba Bosigo established his royal kraal. The name\r\nof the \"Chief of the Mountain\" is written larger even than Tchaka's\r\nover South African history, and to-day his people are the only tribe\r\nwho have any substantive independence. Alone among native chiefs he\r\nshowed the intellect of a trained statesman, and a tireless patience\r\nwhich is only too rare in the annals of statesmanship. The presence of\r\nFrench missionaries at his court gave him the means of instruction in\r\nEuropean ways, and he was far too clever to have any prejudice against\r\nso startling a departure from the habits of his race. He watched the\r\ndissensions of the rival white peoples, and quietly and cautiously\r\nprofited by their blunders. He made war against them as a tactical\r\nmeasure, and after an undoubted victory increased his power by making\r\na diplomatic peace. He left his tribe riches and security, and the\r\nhistory of Basutoland since his day is one long commentary on the\r\nsurprising talents of its founder. How far the credit is his and how\r\nfar it belongs to his advisers we cannot tell; but we can admire a\r\ncharacter so liberal as to accept advice, and a mind so shrewd that it\r\nsaw unerringly its own advantage. There is none of the wild glamour of\r\nconquest about him, but there is a more abiding reputation for a far\r\nmore intricate work; for, like another statesman, he could make a\r\nsmall town a great city--and with the minimum of expense.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Moshesh the history of South Africa becomes almost\r\nexclusively the history of its white masters. It is an old country, as\r\nold as time, the prey of many conquerors, but with it all a patient\r\nand mysterious land. Civilisations come and go, and after a millennium\r\nor two come others who speculate wildly on the relics of the old. In\r\nsome future century (who knows?), when the Rand is covered with thick\r\nbush and once more the haunt of game, some enlightened sportsman,\r\nhunting in his shirt after the bush-veld manner, may clear the\r\nundergrowth from the workings of the Main Reef and write a chapter\r\nsuch as this on the doings of earlier adventurers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]   An interesting sketch of the palaeolithic remains in South\r\n        Africa is contained in two essays appended to Dr Alfred\r\n        Hillier's 'Raid and Reform' (1898).\r\n\r\n  [2]   The chief authorities on this curious subject are Mr\r\n        Bent's 'Ruined Cities of Mashonaland,' Dr Schlichter's\r\n        papers in the 'Geographical Journal,' Professor Keane's\r\n        'Gold of Ophir,' and Dr Carl Peters' 'Eldorado of the\r\n        Ancients.' Mr Wilmot's 'Monomotapa' contains an\r\n        interesting collection of historical references from\r\n        Phoenician, Arabian, and Portuguese sources; and in 'The\r\n        Ancient Ruins of Rhodesia,' by Messrs Hall and Neal,\r\n        there is a very complete description of the ruins\r\n        examined up to date (1902), and a valuable digest of the\r\n        various theories on the subject.\r\n\r\n  [3]   There is an account of Bantu life in Dr Theal's\r\n        'Portuguese in South Africa.' The same author's 'Kaffir\r\n        Folk-lore' and M. Casalis' 'Les Bassoutos' contain much\r\n        information on their customs and folk-lore; while Bishop\r\n        Callaway's 'Nursery Tales of the Zulus,' M. Jacottet's\r\n        'Contes Populaires des Bassoutos,' and M. Junod's\r\n        'Chants et Contes des Baronga' and 'Nouveaux Contes\r\n        Ronga' are interesting collections of folk-tales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE GENTLEMEN-ADVENTURERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world's changes, so philosophers have observed, spring from small\r\norigins, though their reason and their justification may be ample\r\nenough, and exercise the learned for a thousand years. A sailor's\r\ntale, a book in an old library, may set the adventurer off on his\r\nvoyages, and presently empires arise, and his fatherland alters its\r\nhistory. The world moves to no measured tune; everywhere there are\r\nsudden breaks, paradoxes, high enterprises which end in smoke, and\r\npedestrian beginnings which issue in the imperial purple. All things\r\nhave their ground in theory, and by-and-by a dismal post-mortem\r\nscience will discover impulses which the adventurer never dreamed of.\r\nFew lands, even the most remote, are without this variegated history,\r\nand the crudest commercial power is built up on the _debris_ of\r\nromance. South Africa, which is to-day, and to most men, a parvenu\r\ncountry, founded on the Stock Exchange, has odd incidents in her\r\npedigree. Eliminate all the prehistoric guesses, strike out the Dutch,\r\nand the Old World has still had its share in her fashioning. Europe\r\nmay seem only yesterday to have finally sealed her conquest, but she\r\nhas been trying her hand at it for five hundred years. And the result\r\nof the oldest struggle has been a curious story of failure--often\r\nheroic, seldom wise, but always fascinating, as such stories must be.\r\nIt is associated with one of the smallest, and to-day the least\r\nenterprising, of European peoples; and it has issued in Portugal's\r\nmost notable over-sea possession. Every nation has its holy land of\r\nendeavour--England in India, France in Algiers, Russia in Turkestan.\r\nSuch was South Africa to Portugal; much what Sicily was to the\r\nAthenians, the place linked with all her hopes and with her direst\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n\r\nHappily the adventure was not without its chroniclers. The Dominican\r\nfriar, dos Santos,[4] has sketched for us the empire at its zenith,\r\nand de Barros, the Portuguese Secretary for the Indies, has piously\r\nnarrated its beginnings. But the matter-of-fact histories disguise the\r\nreal daring of the exploit. The chivalry of Europe in its most\r\ncharacteristic form was carried 8000 miles from home to an unknown\r\nland; civilisation of a kind, a Christian church, a code of honour,\r\nthe rudiments of law and commerce, and the amenities of life, were\r\nplanted on a narrow malarial seaboard by men who had taken years in\r\nthe voyage, and had scarcely a hope of return. It is said that a great\r\npart of courage lies in having done the thing before, but there was no\r\nsuch ingredient in the valour of those adventurers. Risking all on a\r\ndream, they set off on their ten-year excursions, holding an almost\r\ncertain death as a fair stake in the game. The tenth who survived set\r\nthemselves cheerfully to transform their discoveries into a national\r\nasset. They colonised as whole-heartedly, if not as wisely, as any\r\nnation in the world. And in spite of the narrowest and most pragmatic\r\nof cultures, they proved themselves singularly adaptable. The\r\nPortuguese gentlemen, for whom the Cancioneiros were sung, became\r\nAfricans in everything but blood, adopting a new land under their old\r\nflag, and doing their best to Christianise and colonise it. It was not\r\ntheir fault that the unalterable laws of trade and the destinies of\r\nraces shattered in time the fabric at which they had laboured.\r\n\r\nIn 1445, the year in which Diniz Dias is reported to have rounded Cape\r\nVerd, the Portuguese were the most daring seamen in Europe. Dwelling\r\non a promontory, they naturally turned their eyes southward and\r\nwestward, when peace and a moderate wealth gave them leisure for\r\nfancies. Those were the days of the foreglow of the Renaissance.\r\nConstantinople had not yet fallen, but the spirit of inquiry was\r\nabroad, and a fresh wind had blown among scholastic cobwebs. The\r\nChurch had her share in the revival. A belated missionary, or, as it\r\nmay be, commercial, zeal stirred the ecclesiastical powers. Fresh\r\nlands might be won for the Cross, and fresh moneys to build new abbeys\r\nand endow new bishoprics. The merchants of Lisbon and Oporto saw gold\r\nin every traveller's tale, and gladly risked a bark on a promising\r\nundertaking. There lived, too, at the time a sagacious prince, Henry\r\nthe Navigator, the son of Joao I. and Philippa of Lancaster, himself\r\nan amateur of colonisation, who set the fashion for courtiers and\r\ncitizens. So the young Portuguese squire, trained in the pride of his\r\ncaste, his mind nurtured on chivalrous tales, fired readily at the\r\nstrange rumours, and found a peaceful life among his vineyards no\r\nsatisfying career for a man. To him the white sea-wall of the harbour\r\nwas the boundary of the unknown. Out in the west lay the Purple\r\nIslands of King Juba, the forgotten Atlantis, the lost Hesperides,\r\nand dim classical recollections from the monastery school gave\r\nauthority to his fancies. There were but two careers for a gentleman,\r\narms and adventure, and the latter was for the moment the true magnet.\r\nTo him it might be given to find the Golden City, the Ophir of King\r\nSolomon, or to penetrate beyond the deserts to where Prester John[5]\r\nruled his wild empire in the fear of God. And all the while in Europe\r\nmen were wrangling over creeds and syllogisms, questioning the powers\r\nof the Church, grumbling over dogmas, dying for a few square miles of\r\nterritory. What wonder if to high-bred, high-spirited youth Europe\r\nseemed all too narrow--especially to youth in that south-west corner\r\ncut off by the sierras from the world? What mattered desperate peril\r\nso long as it had daylight and honour in it? So with hope at his prow\r\nand a clear conscience the adventurer set out on his travels.\r\n\r\nThe first object of Portuguese enterprise was Bilad Ghana, the modern\r\nSenegal, which they knew of from Arab geographers. The land route\r\nacross the Sahara was closed to them, so they were compelled to reach\r\nit by sea. It was Henry's dream to make the country a Portuguese\r\ndependency, and Christianise it under the iron rule of the Order of\r\nthe Knights of Jesus Christ,--one of those schemes in which the\r\ncrusading spirit and a hunger for new territory are subtly blended in\r\nthe common fashion of the Age of the Adventurers. It was currently\r\nbelieved that the Senegal River rose from a lake near the source of\r\nthe Nile, and would thus enable the Portuguese to join hands with the\r\nChristian monarch of Abyssinia. A special indulgence was obtained from\r\nthe Pope for all who fought under the banner of the Order of Christ.\r\nAnd so, blessed by the Church, a series of slave-raids began, which\r\nwere slowly pushed farther south till Cape Verd was reached, and the\r\ngreat turn of the coast to the east began to puzzle the sea-captains.\r\nHenry died in 1460, having added, as he believed, a vast territory to\r\nthe Portuguese Crown, called by the name of Guinea, which is Bilad\r\nGhana corrupted. That the future interests of its discoverer might be\r\nproperly cared for the new land was divided into parishes, whose\r\nchaplains were bound to say one weekly mass for the Iffante's soul. By\r\nthe time of the death of Affonso V. in 1481 the Portuguese had passed\r\nthe Niger Delta, discovered the island of Fernando Po, and reached a\r\npoint two degrees south of the equator. In 1484 Diego Cam reached the\r\nmouth of the Congo, and next year set up a marble pillar at Cape Cross\r\nto mark his occupation. Another year and Bartolomeo Diaz touched at\r\nAngra Pequena, pushed round the Cape, keeping far out to sea, to Algoa\r\nBay; and on returning discovered that Cabo Tormentoso which his king\r\nchristened Cabo da Boa Esperanza, the first earnest of the hope of the\r\nnew road to the Indies. Portugal had taken rank as the first of\r\nseafaring powers, and, in Politian's words, stood forth as \"the\r\ntrustee of a second world, holding in the hollow of her hand a vast\r\nseries of lands, ports, seas, and islands revealed by the industry of\r\nher sons and the enterprise of her kings.\" Politian asked that the\r\ngreat story might be written while the materials were yet fresh, but\r\nunfortunately Portugal was richer at that time in sea-captains than in\r\nmen of letters.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1497, Vasco da Gama, the greatest of the world's sailors,\r\nleft Lisbon on the greatest of all voyages. The circumnavigation of\r\nAfrica was imposed upon the Archemenid Sataspes as a \"penalty worse than\r\ndeath,\" but to those adventurers death itself was an inconsiderable\r\naccident. Five years before Columbus had made his first journey, an\r\nenterprise not to be named in the same breath as da Gama's. On Christmas\r\nday, having safely passed the Cape, he came to a land of green,\r\ntree-clad shores, which he piously christened Natal. He pushed on past\r\nthe Limpopo and the Zambesi delta to Mozambique, where he found an Arab\r\ncolony, and to Mombasa, where the chief street still bears his name. He\r\nreached Calicut safely on May 20, 1498, ten months and twelve days after\r\nleaving Lisbon; and two years later he returned home with one-third of\r\nthe crew he had sailed with. The Grand Road was now defined; thenceforth\r\nit was a trade-route to which commerce naturally turned. No more\r\nromantic voyages were ever undertaken, for in those forlorn latitudes\r\nChristian and Muslim, East and West, met in war and peace, and creeds\r\nand ideas clashed in the strangest disorder. In the expedition of 1500\r\nunder Pedro Alvarez Cabral two men were set ashore at Melinda, north of\r\nMozambique, to look for Prester John, and history is silent on the fate\r\nof the unfortunate gentlemen. In da Gama's second voyage Nilwa was\r\ncaptured and the Portuguese East African empire began. A fierce\r\nenthusiast was this same da Gama, for, meeting with a great ship of the\r\nSultan of Egypt, filled with Muslim pilgrims, he looted it from stem to\r\nstern, and sent every pilgrim to Paradise.\r\n\r\nAfter da Gama came Affonso d'Albuquerque, who seized Goa, and\r\nestablished his country's hold on the Malabar coast, and pushing on\r\ncaptured Malacca, the richest of the Portuguese trading stations. He\r\nswept all alien navies from the Eastern seas, and established on a\r\nsound basis of naval supremacy a great commercial empire. Nothing less\r\nthan the conquest of Turkey would satisfy him. He dreamed of allying\r\nhimself with Prester John, and establishing himself on the Upper Nile;\r\nand again of raiding Medina, carrying off Muhammad's coffin, and\r\nexchanging it for the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. He captured Hormuz\r\non the Persian Gulf, and with it the enormous trade between India and\r\nAsia Minor; and he was on the eve of leading an expedition against\r\nAden, which he saw to be the key of the Red Sea, when he was struck\r\ndown at Goa, and died, like the great seigneur he was, clothed in the\r\nrobes of his knightly order. Against his expressed wish he was buried\r\nat Goa, for the Portuguese believed that, as long as the bones of\r\ntheir intrepid leader lay there, their Empire of the East would stand.\r\nSo died the foremost of his countrymen, one who may rank with Olive as\r\nthe greatest of Christian viceroys.\r\n\r\nMeantime the East African power had been fully established. Sofala and\r\nMozambique, the chief cities of the coast, had fallen to the\r\nPortuguese, and their eyes turned to what they believed to be the\r\nfabulously rich hinterlands, where Solomon had won his gold and ivory,\r\nand Arab traders had for centuries found their hunting-ground. The\r\nMonomotapa, the chief or emperor of the Makalanga, whose Zimbabwe was\r\nsituated somewhere in what we now know as Mashonaland, took the place\r\nof Prester John in their imagination. They pushed up the Zambesi,\r\nfounding trading stations on the way, which still survive. They found\r\nOphir in every Bantu name, and began that long series of meaningless\r\nwars of conquest which in the end shattered their dream of empire.\r\nGold-seeking has never been an enterprise blessed of Heaven; and the\r\nPortuguese were more unlucky than most adventurers. They found\r\nthemselves involved in desperate wars; fever and poison carried off\r\ntheir leaders; and the grandees, like Barreto and Homem, who in\r\ncuirasses and velvets held indabas with Makalanga chiefs, got little\r\nreward for their diplomacy. Soon the horizon narrowed, boundaries were\r\ndefined, and the colonist sat down in the coast towns to make a living\r\nby legitimate trade.\r\n\r\nThe chief commercial importance of South-East Africa to the Portuguese\r\nwas as a port of call on the great trade-route to the Indies. The\r\nskins, ivory, and gold, which the country produced, could never vie\r\nwith the organised exports of Goa and Calicut. So Mozambique and\r\nSofala became rather depots than supply-grounds, at which the great\r\nships anchored and refitted; points of vantage, too, in the endless\r\nbickerings with Arab traders. There was a modest commerce with the\r\ninterior, with Tete as the chief depot, and Masapa, Luanze, and Bukoto\r\nas the up-country stations. Each inland Portuguese trader was also a\r\ndiplomat. Through him the presents passed from the Portuguese king to\r\nthe savage \"emperors,\" and, situated as he might be at Masapa, on the\r\nvery edge of the mountain Fura and the forbidden Makalanga country,\r\nhis duties were often most delicate and hazardous. The trade as a\r\nwhole was neither productive nor well managed. The whole empire was\r\nundermanned. Portugal was colonising Brazil and West Africa at the\r\ntime she was sending out her adventurers to the East, and the little\r\nkingdom in Europe could not long endure the strain. The sons she sent\r\nforth rarely returned; and the estates at home fell out of cultivation\r\nfor lack of men. Meantime stronger and more fortunate races were\r\nappearing in the Eastern waters. The Englishmen Newbery, Candish, and\r\nRaymond began the rivalry, and the formidable Dutch followed next,\r\nwith their northern vigour and commercial aptitudes. In 1595 the first\r\nof Linschoten's books was published, and opened up a new world for\r\nDutch enterprise. The Dutch East India Company soon wrested from\r\nPortugal her Indian possessions, and in a little her East African\r\nports were mere isolated stations, much harassed by the Netherland\r\nfleets, and the Grand Road had become a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nBut, as commerce declined, a new epoch in the Portuguese history\r\nbegan. The disappearance of trade was followed by the advent of one of\r\nthe most heroic missionary brotherhoods in history. The Jesuit\r\nGonsalvo de Silveira was the pioneer, and a year after he landed in\r\nAfrica he was murdered by the Makalanga chief. Some fifty years later\r\nthe Dominicans joined the Jesuits, and till the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century laboured at their quixotic task. Now and then a\r\nchief's son was baptised and attained to some degree of civilisation,\r\nbut the mass of the people, living among fierce tribal wars, cared\r\nlittle for curious tales of peace. There was no ostentation with those\r\nBishops of This or That _in partibus infidelium_. No churches remain\r\nto tell of their work. They lived simply in huts, and died a thousand\r\nmiles away from their kin, so that their very names are forgotten. In\r\nour own day travellers in the Zambesi valley have come to kraals where\r\nthe people called themselves Christians, and showed a few perverted\r\nrites in evidence, the one relic of those forgotten heroes. A few\r\nincidents, however, have remained in men's minds. Luiz do Espirito\r\nSanta, a prior of Mozambique, on being taken into the presence of the\r\nMonomotapa and ordered to make obeisance, stiffened his back, and\r\nreplied that he did such homage to God alone; for which noble saying\r\nhe was duly murdered. The Shining Cross, which Constantine saw,\r\nappeared also to the friar Manoel Sardinha when he led his forces\r\nagainst the Makalanga. In 1652 the Monomotapa Manuza was received into\r\nthe Church, an event which was the occasion for a great thanksgiving\r\nservice at Lisbon, at which the king Joao IV. attended in state. His\r\nson, Miguel, entered the Dominican order, was given the diploma of\r\nMaster of Theology, and died a vicar of the convent of Santa Barbara\r\nin Goa. This barbarian Charles V., the greatest South African chief of\r\nhis time, may well be remembered among the few mortals who have\r\nvoluntarily renounced a crown.\r\n\r\nAnd so the empire, having shipwrecked on a dream of gold and a land\r\nwhere men could not live,[6] dwindled down to isolated forts and\r\nstations, and the strenuous creed of the pioneers was softened into\r\nthe bastard contentment of the disheartened. Miserably and corruptly\r\ngoverned, forgotten by Europe, they forgot Europe in turn, and a\r\nstrange somnolent life began of half-barbaric, wholly oriental\r\nseigneurs, ruling as petty monarchs over natives from whom they were\r\nnot wholly distinct.[7] Instead of holding the outposts of European\r\nculture, they sank themselves into the ways of the soil which their\r\nforefathers had conquered. Round Tete and Inhambane and Sofala there\r\ngrew up great country estates, held on a kind of feudal tenure, where\r\nthe slack-mouthed grandee idled away his days. Set among acres of\r\norchards and gardens, those dwellings were often noble and sumptuous.\r\nThither came belated travellers, gold-seekers, shipwrecked seamen,\r\nwandering friars, men of every nationality and trade, and in the prazo\r\nof a de Mattos or a de Mira found something better than the mealie-pap\r\nthey had been living on in native kraals. Sitting on soft couches,\r\ndrinking good Madeira, and looking at a copy of a Murillo or a\r\nVelasquez on the walls, they may well have extolled those oases in the\r\ndesert. The grandee had his harem, like any Arab sheikh; he dispensed\r\ndeath cruelly and casually among his subjects; but as a rule he seems\r\nto have had the virtue of hospitality, and welcomed gladly any\r\ntraveller with tales of the forgotten world. Fierce Bantu wars have\r\nleft few traces of those pleasant demesnes; but to the new-comer the\r\nland where they once existed has still a quaint air of decadent\r\ncivilisation. Coming down from the high tableland of the interior,\r\nwhich is the most strenuous land on earth, through the mountain glens\r\nwhich, but for vegetation, might be Norway, one enters a country of\r\nbush and full muddy rivers, a country of dull lifeless green and a\r\npestilent climate. But as one draws nearer the coast, where glimpses\r\nof gardens appear and white-walled estancias, and rivers spread into\r\nlagoons with spits of yellow sand and Arab boatmen, and, last of all,\r\nthe pale blue Indian Ocean stretches its sleepy leagues to the\r\nhorizon, there comes a new feeling into the scene, as of something\r\nold, not new, decaying rather than undeveloped, which, joined with the\r\nmoist heat, makes the place\r\n\r\n                             \"A land\r\n    In which it seemed always afternoon,\r\n    All round the coast the languid air did swoon,\r\n    Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.\"\r\n\r\nThe tale of this empire, crude and melancholy as it is, provides an\r\ninstructive commentary on current theories of colonisation. From Tyre\r\nand Sidon down to the last Teutonic performance, there is surely\r\nsufficient basis to generalise on; but no two theorists are agreed\r\nupon the laws which govern those racial adventures. The only approach\r\nto a dogma is the theory that to colonise is to decentralise--that\r\nbefore a vigorous life can begin over-sea the runners must be cut\r\nwhich bind the colony to the homeland. France fails, we say, because a\r\nFrenchman away from home cannot keep his mind off the boulevards; he\r\nis for ever an exile, not a settler. Britain succeeds because her sons\r\nfind a land of their adoption. But the converse is equally important,\r\nthough too rare in its application to be often remembered. No race can\r\ncolonise which cannot decentralise its energy; but equally no race can\r\ncolonise which can wholly decentralise its sentiment and memory.\r\nPortugal failed for this reason chiefly, that the Portuguese forgot\r\nPortugal. Few peoples have been so adaptable. The white man's pride\r\ndied in their hearts. They were ready to mix with natives on equal\r\nterms.[8] Now concubinage is bad, but legitimate marriage with\r\nhalf-castes is infinitely worse for the _morale_ of a people. And\r\nsince Nature to the end of time has a care of races but not of\r\nhybrids, this tolerant, foolish, unstable folk dropped out of the\r\nbattle-line of life, and sank from conquerors to resident aliens,\r\nwhile their country passed from an empire to a vague seaboard. \"A\r\npeople scattered by their wars and affairs over the whole earth, and\r\nhome-sick to a man,\" wrote Emerson of the English, and it is the trait\r\nof the true colonist. It is as important to remember \"sweet Argos\" as\r\nit is to avoid a womanish _heimweh_. For a colony is a sapling, bound\r\nby the law of nature to follow the development of the parent tree. A\r\nparcel of Englishmen on the Australian coast have no significance\r\nwithout England at their back, to give them a tradition of manners and\r\ngovernment, to be their recruiting-ground, to hold out at once a\r\nmemory of home and an ideal of polity. Wars of separation may come,\r\nbut a colony is still a colony: it may have a different colour on the\r\nmap, but its moral complexion is the same; politically it may be a\r\nrival, spiritually it remains a daughter.\r\n\r\nThe country, too, was wretchedly governed. The Portuguese viceroy,\r\noften some impoverished noble, was in the same position as the Roman\r\nproconsul, and had to restore his fortunes at the expense of the\r\nprovincials. Local administration was farmed out to local magnates,\r\nanother part of the crazy decentralisation which led to catastrophe.\r\nThere is more in bad government than hardship for the private citizen.\r\nIt means the weakening of the intellectual and moral nerve of the race\r\nwhich tolerates it. Sound government is not, as revolutionary\r\ndoctrinaires used to think, the outcome of the grace of God and a\r\nflawless code of abstractions. It means a perpetual effort, a keen\r\nsense of reality, a constant facing and adjusting of problems. And it\r\nis one of the laws of life that this high faculty is inconsistent with\r\nextreme luxury and ease. A great governor may be one-fourth voluptuary,\r\nbut he must be three-parts politician. \"Je n'aime pas beaucoup les\r\nfemmes,\" was one of Napoleon's self-criticisms, \"ni le jeu--enfin rien;\r\nje suis tout a fait un etre politique.\" The thin strain of old-world\r\ntradition was useless in men who were sheikhs, adventurers, grandees,\r\nbut never statesmen.\r\n\r\nBut the ultimate source of weakness was economic. The settlements\r\nwere unproductive in any real sense. The empire was a chain of forts\r\nand depots, and on no side was the ruling power organically connected\r\nwith the soil. A colony should be built up of farmers and miners and\r\nmanufacturers, having for its basis the productive energy of the land.\r\nTo exploit is not to colonise, and on this side there is the most\r\nurgent need for decentralisation. The Portuguese lost their European\r\nculture, but they remained adventurers and aliens. Their traders\r\nbargained for produce, but they never went to the root of the matter\r\nand organised production. They had no ranches or plantations, only\r\ntheir trading-booths. Like the Carthaginians, they carried their\r\ncommerce to the ends of the earth, and left the ends of the earth\r\nradically unaffected by their presence. People repeat glibly that trade\r\nfollows the flag, and that commerce is the basis of empire. And in a\r\nsense it is true, for an empire without commercial inter-relations and\r\na solid basis of material prosperity is a house built on the sand. But\r\nif the maxim be taken in the sense that commerce is in itself a\r\nsufficient imperial bond, it is the most fatal of heresies. The Dutch,\r\nin their heyday, had an empire chiefly of forts and factories; and what\r\npart has the Dutch empire played in the destinies of mankind? No race\r\nor kingdom can endure which is not rooted in the soil, drawing\r\nsustenance from natural forces, increasing by tillage and forestry,\r\npasturage and mining and manufacture, the aggregate of the world's\r\nproduction. And the need is as much moral as economic. The trader pure\r\nand simple--Tyrian, Greek, Venetian, Dutch, or Portuguese--is too\r\ncosmopolitan and adventitious to be the staple of a strong race. He has\r\nnot the common local affections; he is not knit close enough to nature\r\nin his toil. To wrest a living from the avarice of the earth is to form\r\ncharacter with the salt and iron of power in it. India, it is true, is\r\na partial exception; but India is a unique case of a long-settled\r\nsubject people ruled wisely by a race which has sufficient breadth and\r\nvitality in its culture to spare time for the experiment. It is to\r\ncolonies, which must always form the major part of an empire, that the\r\nmaxim applies; for the former is a native power under tutelage, while\r\nthe latter is the expansion of the parent country beyond the seas. And\r\nthis expansion must be more than commercial. The colony must be founded\r\nin the soil, its people with each generation becoming more indigenous,\r\nand its wealth based on its own toil and enterprise; otherwise it is\r\nbut such a chain of factories as the Portuguese established, which the\r\nproverbial whiff of grape-shot may scatter to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [4]   There is an English abbreviation of dos Santos in\r\n        Pinkerton's 'General Collection of Voyages and\r\n        Travels.' The original work was printed at Evora in\r\n        1609.\r\n\r\n  [5]   The Portuguese geographers divided Central Africa into\r\n        Angola in the west, the kingdom of Prester John in the\r\n        north (Abyssinia), and the empire of Monomotapa\r\n        (Mashonaland) in the south. The real Prester John was a\r\n        Nestorian Christian in Central Asia, whose khanate was\r\n        destroyed by Genghis Khan about the end of the twelfth\r\n        century; but the name became a generic one for any\r\n        supposed Christian monarch in unknown countries.\r\n\r\n  [6]   Purchas wrote, \"Barreto was discomfited not by the Negro\r\n        but by the Ayre, the malignity whereof is the same sauce\r\n        of all their golden countries in Africa.\"\r\n\r\n  [7]   One missionary wrote, \"They have already lost the\r\n        knowledge of Christians and thrown away the obligations\r\n        of Faith\" (Wilmot, 'Monomotapa,' p. 215).\r\n\r\n  [8]   Among the Baronga, the Bantu tribe who live around Delagoa\r\n        Bay, there are some ancient folk-tales, derived from\r\n        Portuguese sources, in which the heroes have Portuguese\r\n        names, such as Joao, Boniface, Antonio. One tale about\r\n        the king's daughter, who was saved from witchcraft by\r\n        the courage of a young adventurer called Joao, is a form\r\n        of the story of Jack and the ugly Princess, which\r\n        appears throughout European folk-lore. Cf. M. Junod's\r\n        'Chants et Contes des Baronga,' pp. 274-322.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT TREK.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery race has its Marathon into which the historian does not inquire\r\ntoo closely who has a reverence for holy places and a fear of\r\nsacrilege. It may be a battle or a crusade, a creed, or perhaps only a\r\npoem, but whatever it is, it is part and parcel of the national life,\r\nand it is impossible to reach the naked truth through the rose-coloured\r\nmists of pious tradition. A Sempach or a Bannockburn cannot be\r\nexplained by a bare technical history. The spirit of a nation was in\r\narms, the national spirit was the conqueror, and the combatants appear\r\nmore than mere flesh and blood, walking \"larger than human\" on the\r\nhills of story. This phenomenon has merits which it is hard to\r\nexaggerate. It is the basis for the rhetorical self-confidence which is\r\nessential to a strong race. It is a fountain from which generous youth\r\ncan draw inspiration, an old watchword to call the inert to battle. If\r\nthe race has a literature, it helps to determine its character; if the\r\nrace has none, it provides a basis for fireside tales. The feeblest\r\nGreek at the court of Artaxerxes must have now and then straightened\r\nhimself when he remembered Salamis. Without such a retrospect a people\r\nwill live in a crude present, and, having no buttress from the past,\r\nwill fare badly from the rough winds of life.\r\n\r\nTo the Boer the Great Trek is the unrecorded but ever-remembered\r\nOdyssey of his people. He has a long memory, perhaps because of his\r\nvery slowness and meagreness of fancy. His life was so monotonous that\r\nthe tale of how his fathers first came into the land inspired him by\r\nits unlikeness to his own somnolent traditions. Besides, he had a\r\nScriptural parallel. The persecuted children of Israel, in spite of\r\nthe opposition of Pharaoh, had fled across the desert from Egypt and\r\nfound a Promised Land. The Boer sense of analogy is extremely vivid\r\nand extremely inexact. Here he saw a perfect precedent. A God-fearing\r\npeople, leaving their homes doubtless at the call of the Most High,\r\nhad fled into the wilds of Amalek and Edom, conquered and dispossessed\r\nthe Canaanites, and occupied a land which, if not flowing with milk\r\nand honey, was at least well grassed and plentifully watered. How keen\r\nthe sense of Scriptural example was, and how constantly present to the\r\nBoer mind was the thought that he was following in the footsteps of\r\nIsrael, is shown by one curious story. The voortrekkers, pushing out\r\nfrom Pretoria, struck a stream which flowed due north, the first large\r\nnorth-running water they had met. Moreover, it was liable to droughts\r\nand floods recurring at fixed seasons. What could it be but the great\r\nriver of Egypt? So with immense pious satisfaction they recognised it\r\nas the Nile, and the Nyl it remains to this day.\r\n\r\nThe thought of a national exodus comes easily to the Aryan mind,--an\r\ninheritance from primeval Asian wanderings. And in itself it is\r\nsomething peculiarly bold and romantic, requiring a renunciation of\r\nold ties and sentiments impossible to an over-domesticated race. It\r\nrequires courage of a high order and a confident faith in destiny.\r\nPerhaps the courage needed in the case of the Great Trek was less\r\nthan in most similar undertakings, because of the cheering Scriptural\r\nprecedent and the lack of that imagination which can vividly forecast\r\nthe future. The past history of the Boer, too, prepared him for\r\ndesperate enterprises. Made up originally of doubtful adventurers from\r\nHolland, hardihood grew up in their blood as they pushed northwards\r\nfrom the seacoast. The people of the littoral might be, as Lady Anne\r\nBarnard found them, sluggish and spiritless; but the farmers of\r\nColesberg and Graaff-Reinet were in the nature of things a different\r\nbreed. The true Dutch blood does not readily produce an adventurer,\r\nbut it was leavened and sublimated by a French Huguenot strain, scions\r\nof good families exiled for the most heroic of causes. The coarse\r\nstrong Dutch stock swallowed them up; the language disappeared, the\r\nColberts became Grobelaars, the Villons Viljoens, the Pinards\r\nPienaars; but something remained of _elan_ and spiritual exaltation.\r\nHarassed from the north by Griqua and Hottentot bandits, and from the\r\neast by Kaffir incursions, they became a hardy border race, keeping\r\ntheir own by dint of a strong arm. The quiet of the great sun-washed\r\nspaces entered into their souls. They grew taciturn, ungraceful,\r\nprofoundly attached to certain sombre dogmas, impatient of argument or\r\nrestraint, bad citizens for any modern State, but not without a\r\ngnarled magnificence of their own. They were out of line with the\r\nwhole world, far nearer in kinship to an Old Testament patriarch than\r\nto the townsfolk with whom they shared the country. All angles and\r\ncorners, they presented an admirable front to savage nature; but they\r\nwere hard to dovetail into a complex modern society. They would have\r\nmade good Ironsides, and would have formed a stubborn left wing at\r\nArmageddon, but they did ill with franchises and taxes and paternal\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nI will take two savage tales from their history to show what manner of\r\nmen they were in extremity. A certain Frederick Bezuidenhout, a farmer\r\nin the Bruintje Hoogte, and by all accounts a dabbler in less reputable\r\ntrades, was summoned on some charge before the landdrost of the\r\ndistrict, and declined to appear. A warrant was issued for his\r\napprehension, and a party of soldiers sent out to enforce it, whereupon\r\nBezuidenhout took refuge in a cave, and was shot dead in its defence.\r\nThe fiery cross went round among his relatives; overtures, which were\r\nrefused, were made to the Kaffir chiefs, and Jan Bezuidenhout, the\r\nbrother of the dead man, swore to fealty a band of as pretty outlaws as\r\never dwelt on a border. The insurrection failed; thirty-nine of the\r\ninsurgents were captured, and five were hanged, and Jan Bezuidenhout\r\nhimself was shot in the Kaffir country by an advance party of the\r\npursuit. Such is the too famous story of Slachter's Nek. The tale of\r\nConrad de Buys[9] and his doings is wilder but more obscure. A man of\r\ngreat physical strength and the worst character, he was the leader of\r\nthe sterner desperadoes on the Kaffir border. Through living much in\r\nnative kraals he had become little better than a savage. He was mixed\r\nup in Van Jaarsveld's insurrection, and by-and-by his private crimes\r\nexceeded his political by so much that he was compelled to flee into\r\nthe northern wilds. This first of the voortrekkers is next heard of on\r\nthe banks of the Limpopo, living in pure barbarism, with a harem of\r\nKaffir wives and an immense prestige among his neighbours. The emigrant\r\nparty under Potgieter, on their return from Delagoa Bay, found\r\nsomewhere in the Lydenburg hills two half-breeds who called this\r\nruffian father and acted as interpreters. Conrad peopled the Transvaal\r\nwith his children, whom he seems to have ruled in a patriarchal\r\nfashion, forming a real Buys clan, who still hang together at Marah, in\r\nZoutpansberg. In the Pietersburg Burgher camp during the war there was\r\na Buys location, who strenuously urged their claim to be considered a\r\nwhite people and burghers of the republic.\r\n\r\nSuch was one element in the race of border farmers--a substratum of\r\ndesperate lawlessness. But there were other elements, many of them\r\nnoble and worthy. Their morals were less bad than peculiar; their\r\nlawlessness rather an inability to understand restrictions than an\r\nimpulse to disorder. They had their own staunch loyalties, their own\r\nstrict code of honour. They had the self-confidence of a people whose\r\ndogmatic foundations are unshaken, and who are in habitual intercourse\r\nwith an inferior race. In a rude way they were kindly and hospitable.\r\nThey had a courage so unwavering that it may be called an instinct,\r\nand the bodily strength which comes from bare living and constant\r\nexertion. \"Simple\" and \"pastoral\" used to be words of praise. During\r\nthe late war they became a sneer; but it is well to recognise that\r\nwhile they may comprise the gravest faults they must denote a few\r\nsterling virtues.\r\n\r\nWhen Pieter Retief left Graaff-Reinet in 1837, he issued an ingenious\r\nproclamation which contains his justification of the Great Trek. He\r\ncomplains of the unnecessary hardships attending the emancipation of\r\nthe slaves, the insecurity of life and property caused by the absence\r\nof proper vagrancy laws, and the disaster certain to attend Lord\r\nGlenelg's reversal of British policy on the Kaffir border. Retief was a\r\nman of high and conscientious character, and his profession of faith is\r\nvaluable as showing the view of current politics held by the better\r\nclass of the voortrekkers. They did not defend slavery--Retief\r\nexpressly repudiates it; but they objected to the method of its\r\nabolition, and the lack of precautions for future public safety which\r\nthe event demanded. Lord Glenelg's withdrawal from the eastern border\r\nto the boundary of the Keiskama and Tyumie rivers, as fixed by Lord\r\nCharles Somerset in 1819, appeared to them a flagrant piece of\r\nweakness which sooner or later must make life on that border\r\nimpossible. They saw no hope of redress from the imperial Government,\r\nwhich seemed to be dominated by philanthropic hysteria. It is a grave\r\nindictment, and worth examination. The slavery question stands in the\r\nforeground. The ocean slave-trade was suppressed in 1807, and the\r\nEnglish abolitionists had leisure to turn their minds to South Africa.\r\nThe first progressive enactment came in 1816, when the registration of\r\nslaves and slave-births was made compulsory in every district. In 1823\r\na series of laws were passed restricting slave labour on the Sabbath,\r\ngiving slaves the right of owning property, and limiting the\r\npunishments to which they were liable. In 1826 officials were\r\nappointed in country districts to watch over slave interests, and see\r\nthat the protective enactments were carried out. The famous Fiftieth\r\nOrdinance of 1828 gave the Hottentots the same legal rights as the\r\nwhite colonists. Meanwhile for years a great missionary agitation for\r\ntotal abolition had been going on, which was powerfully supported by\r\nthe Whig party in England. The Dutch saw clearly the trend of events,\r\nand, in what is known as the \"Graaff-Reinet proposals,\" attempted to\r\nprocure gradually the emancipation which they realised was bound to\r\ncome. They proposed, unanimously, that after a date to be fixed by\r\nGovernment all female children should be free at birth, and, by a\r\nmajority, that all male children born after the same date should also\r\nbe free. I cannot find in these proposals the insidious attempt to\r\ndefeat the movement which some writers have discerned: they seem to\r\nme to be as fair and reasonable an offer as we could expect a\r\nslave-holding class to make. But the British attitude is also\r\nperfectly clear. Slave-holding had been condemned as a crime by the\r\nnational conscience, and there could be no temporising with the evil\r\nthing. Here, again, a certain kind of education was necessary to\r\nappreciate the point of view. The farmers of Graaff-Reinet had not\r\nlistened to the harangues of Wilberforce and Fowell Buxton; Zion\r\nChapel and its all-pervading atmosphere of mild brotherly love were\r\nnot within the compass of their experience. England was right, as she\r\ngenerally is in policies which are inspired by a profound popular\r\nconviction; but she could hardly expect men of a very different\r\ntraining to fall in readily with her views. In any case the working\r\nout of the policy was attended by many blunders. The Emancipation Act\r\ntook effect in Cape Colony from the 1st of December 1834. L1,200,000\r\nseems a rather inadequate compensation for 35,000 slaves, and as each\r\nclaim had to be presented before commissioners in London, the farmer\r\nhad perforce to employ an agent, who bought up his claims at a\r\ndiscount of anything from 18 to 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe losses from emancipation were chiefly felt in the rich agricultural\r\ndistricts of the colony, such as Stellenbosch, Ceres, and Worcester; the\r\nborder farmers were not a large slave-owning class, and the lack of\r\ncheap labour did not trouble them. But emancipation meant a general\r\ndislocation of credit all over the country. A man who in 1833 was\r\ncounted a rich man was comparatively poor in 1835, and this _peripeteia_\r\nhad a bad effect on the whole farming class. It was rather the spirit of\r\nthe Act which the Boers of Graaff-Reinet complained of,--the theory, to\r\nthem ridiculous, that the black man could have legal rights comparable\r\nwith the white, and the sense of insecurity which dwellers under such a\r\n_regime_ must feel. The average Boer was an arbitrary but not an unkind\r\nslave-master; he regarded his slaves as part of his _familia_, an\r\nenclosure to which the common law should not penetrate. To be limited by\r\nstatute in the use of what he considered his chattels, to find hundreds\r\nof officious gentlemen ready to take the part of the chattels on any\r\noccasion against him, were pills too bitter to swallow. Emancipation\r\nproduced vagrants, and he asked for a stringent vagrancy law which his\r\nlandrosts could administer. England, refusing naturally to take away\r\nwith one hand what she had given with the other, declined to expose the\r\nemancipated slave to the arbitrariness of local tribunals. Well, argued\r\nthe farmers, our slaves, being free, have become rogues and vagabonds;\r\nthey may plunder us at their pleasure and England will take their part:\r\nit is time for us to seek easier latitudes.\r\n\r\nBut the chief factor in Dutch dissatisfaction was undoubtedly Lord\r\nGlenelg's limitation of the eastern border line. There is something to\r\nbe said for the view of that discredited, and, to tell the truth, not\r\nvery wise statesman. The Boer was a bad neighbour for a Kaffir people.\r\nHe was always encroaching, spurred on by that nomadic something in\r\nhis blood--a true Campbell of Breadalbane, who built his house on the\r\nlimits of his estate that he might \"brise yont.\" A buffer state was\r\napt to become very soon a Boer territory. Better to try and establish\r\na strong Kaffir people, who might attain to some semblance of national\r\nlife, and under the maternal eye of Britain become useful and\r\nprogressive citizens. So reasoned Lord Glenelg and his advisers,\r\nmissionary and official. Unfortunately facts were against him, the\r\nchimera of a Kaffir nation was soon dispelled, and ten years later Sir\r\nHarry Smith, a governor who did not suffer from illusions, made the\r\neastern province a Kaffir reserve under a British commissioner. The\r\nfrontier Boer, however, was not in a position to share any sentiment\r\nabout a Kaffir nation. He saw his cattle looted, his family compelled\r\nto leave their newly acquired farm, and a long prospect of Kaffir\r\nraids where the presumption of guilt would always be held to lie\r\nagainst his own worthy self. Above all things he saw a barred door. No\r\nmore \"brising yont\" for him on the eastern border. Expansion, space,\r\nwere as the breath of his nostrils, and if he could not have them in\r\nthe old colony he would seek them in the untravelled northern wilds.\r\n\r\nThere were thus certain well-defined reasons for the Great Trek in\r\ncontemporary politics which, combined with distorted memories like\r\nSlachter's Nek, made up in Boer eyes a very complete indictment\r\nagainst Pharaoh and his counsellors. But the real reason lay in his\r\nblood. Had the British Government been all that he could desire, he\r\nwould still have gone. He was a wanderer from his birth, and trekking,\r\neven for great distances, was an incident of his common life. A\r\npastoral people have few vested interests in land. There are no\r\nancient homesteads to leave, or carefully-tended gardens or rich\r\ncorn-lands. Their wealth is in their herds, which can be driven at\r\nwill to other pastures. The Boer rarely built much of a farm, and he\r\nnever fenced. A cottage, a small vegetable-yard, and a stable made up\r\nthe homestead on even large farms on the border. There was nothing to\r\nleave when he had gathered his horned cattle into a mob, yoked his\r\nbest team to his waggon, and stowed his rude furniture inside. With\r\nhis rifle slung on his shoulder, he was as free to take the road as\r\nany gipsy. He was leaving the country of the alien, where mad fancies\r\nheld sway and unjust laws and taxes oppressed him. He was bound for\r\nthe far lands of travellers' tales, the country of rich grass and\r\nendless game, where he could live as he pleased and preserve the\r\nfashions of his fathers unchanged. He would meet with fierce tribes,\r\nbut his elephant-gun, as he knew from experience, was a match for many\r\nassegais. There was much heroism in the Great Trek, but there was also\r\nfor the young and hale an exhilarating element of sport. To them it\r\nwas a new, strange, and audacious adventure. No predikant accompanied\r\nthe emigrants. The Kirk did not see the Scriptural parallel, and to a\r\nman preferred the treasure in Egypt to the doubtful fortunes of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\nThe first party consisted of about thirty waggons, under the\r\nleadership of Louis Trichard and Jan van Rensburg. They travelled\r\nslowly, the men hunting along the route, and outspanned for days, and\r\neven weeks, at pleasant watering-places. The main object of those\r\npioneers was to ascertain the road to Delagoa Bay; so they did not\r\nseek land for settlement, but pushed on till they came to Piet\r\nPotgieter's Rust, a hundred miles or so north of Pretoria, which they\r\nthought to be about the proper latitude. Here the party divided. Van\r\nRensburg and his men went due east into the wild Lydenburg country on\r\ntheir way to the coast, and were never heard of again. Trichard waited\r\na little, and then slowly groped his way through the Drakensberg to\r\nPortuguese territory. The band suffered terribly from fever; their\r\nherds were annihilated by the tsetse fly, of which they now heard for\r\nthe first time; but in the end about twenty-six survivors struggled\r\ndown to the bay and took ship for Natal. So ended the adventure of the\r\npath-finders. The next expedition was led by the famous Andries\r\nPotgieter, and came from the Tarka and Colesberg districts. The little\r\nPaulus Kruger, a boy of ten, travelled with the waggons to the country\r\nwhich he was to rule for long. Potgieter settled first in the\r\nneighbourhood of Thaba 'Nchu on the Basuto border, and bought a large\r\ntract of land from a Bataung chief. Farms were marked out, and a few\r\nemigrants remained, but the majority pushed on to the north and east.\r\nSome crossed the Vaal, and finding a full clear stream coming down\r\nfrom the north, christened it the Mooi or Fair River; and here in\r\nafter-days, faithful to their first impression, they planted the old\r\ncapital of the Transvaal. Potgieter with a small band set off on the\r\nsearch for Delagoa Bay, but he seems to have lost himself in the\r\nmountains between Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg. On his return he found\r\nthat Mosilikatse's warriors had at last given notice of their\r\npresence, and had massacred a number of small outlying settlements. So\r\nbegan one of the sternest struggles in South African history.\r\n\r\nPotgieter gathered all the survivors into a great laager at a place\r\ncalled Vechtkop, between the Rhenoster and Wilge rivers. The\r\nprecaution was taken none too soon, for one morning a few days later\r\na huge native army appeared, led by the chief induna of Mosilikatse.\r\nThe odds, so far as can be gathered, were about a hundred to one, but\r\nthe little band was undaunted, and Sarel Celliers, a true Cromwellian\r\ndevotee of the Bible and the sword, called his men to prayer. Then\r\nforty farmers rode out from the laager, galloped within range, spread\r\nout and fired a volley, riding back swiftly to reload. They did good\r\nexecution, but forty men, however bold, cannot disperse 5000, and in a\r\nlittle the Matabele were round the laager, and the siege began. The\r\ndefence was so vigorous that after heavy losses the enemy withdrew,\r\ndriving with them the little stock which formed the sole wealth of the\r\nemigrants.\r\n\r\nThe glove had been thrown down and there could be no retreat. Midian\r\nmust be destroyed root and branch before Israel could possess the\r\nland. After a short rest Potgieter and Gerrit Maritz began the war of\r\nreprisals. With a commando of over 100 men and a few Griqua followers,\r\nthey forded the Vaal, crossed the Magaliesberg, and arrived at\r\nMosilikatse's chief kraal at Mosega. The farmers' victory was\r\ncomplete. Over 400 of the Matabele were slain, several thousand head\r\nof cattle secured, and the kraal given to the flames. Potgieter\r\nreturned to found the little town of Winburg in memory of his victory,\r\nand, with the assistance of Pieter Retief, to frame a constitution for\r\nthe nascent state. But Mosilikatse still remained. He had not been\r\npresent at the _debacle_ of Mosega, and while he remained on the\r\nfrontier there was no security for life and property. New recruits had\r\ncome up from the south, including the redoubtable family of Uys, the\r\nhorses were in good condition, all had had a breathing-space; so a new\r\nand more formidable expedition started in search of the enemy. They\r\nfound him on the Marico, and for nine days fought with him on the old\r\nplan of a charge, a volley, and a retreat. Then one morning there was\r\nno enemy to fight; a cloud of dust to the north showed the line of his\r\nflight; Mosilikatse had retired across the Limpopo. Whereupon the\r\nemigrants proclaimed the whole of the late Matabele territory--the\r\nTransvaal, the Orange River Colony, and a portion of Bechuanaland--as\r\ntheirs by the right of conquest.\r\n\r\nSo runs the tale of the Great Trek,--rather an Iliad than an Odyssey,\r\nperhaps, and a very bloodthirsty Iliad, too. To most men it must seem\r\na noble and spirited story. Whatever the justice of the emigrants'\r\ngrievances, they conducted themselves well in their self-imposed\r\nexile. Potgieter and his men were indeed rather exceptional specimens\r\nof their race, and they were strung to the highest pitch by Christian\r\nfaith and the unchristian passion of revenge. They relapsed, when all\r\nwas over, to a somewhat ordinary type of farmer, which seems to bear\r\nout the general conception of the Boer character--that, while it is\r\ncapable of high deeds, it is powerful by sudden effort rather than by\r\nsustained and strenuous toil. The experiment which began so well\r\nshould have ended in something better than two bourgeois republics.\r\nThere are some who see in the tale nothing more than an unwarranted\r\ninvasion of native territory, and a cruel massacre of a brave race. No\r\nview could be more unjust. The Matabele had not a scrap of title to\r\nthe country, and had not dwelt in it more than a few years. The real\r\nowners, if you can talk of ownership at all, were the unfortunate\r\nBataungs and Barolongs, whom the emigrants befriended. The Matabele\r\nwere indeed as murderous a race of savages as ever lived, and their\r\ndefeat was a moral as well as a political necessity. It is well to\r\nprotect the aborigine, but when he is armed with a dozen assegais and\r\nearnestly desires your blood, it is safer to shoot him or drive him\r\nfarther afield. That the Boers were guilty of atrocities in those\r\nfierce wars is undoubted, and, if some tales be true, unpardonable.\r\nBut there are excuses to be made. When a man has seen his child\r\nwrithing on a spear and his wife mutilated; when he reflects that he\r\nstands alone against impossible odds, and has a keen sense, too, of\r\nScriptural parallels,--he may be forgiven if he slays and spares not,\r\nand even gives way to curious cruelties. Revenge and despair may play\r\nodd pranks with the best men: _tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner_.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the proper view to take of this footnote to the world's\r\nhistory, this Marathon of an unimaginative race? It is possible to see\r\nin it only an attempt of a half-savage people to find elbow-room for\r\ntheir misdeeds. The voortrekkers, it has been said, fled the approach\r\nof a mild and enlightened modern policy, invaded a land which was not\r\ntheirs, slaughtered a people who had every right to resist them, and\r\ncreated for themselves space to practise their tyranny over the\r\nnative, and perpetuate their exploded religious and political creed in\r\na retrograde society. It is easy to say this, as it is easy to explain\r\nthe doings of the Pilgrim Fathers as a flight from a too liberal and\r\ntolerant land to wilds where intolerance could rule unchecked. With\r\nthe best will in the world to scrutinise Dutch legends, the Great Trek\r\nseems to me just that legend which can well support any scrutiny. For\r\nit was first and foremost a conflict between civilisations. There were\r\nstrong and worthy men among the voortrekkers, as there were estimable\r\npeople among their opponents. The modern political creed, based on\r\nEnglish constitutionalism, stray doctrines of the French Revolution,\r\nand certain economic maxims from Bentham and Adam Smith, is, in spite\r\nof minor differences, common to the civilised world. This was the\r\ncreed which was forced upon the Border Dutch, and, having received no\r\neducation in the axioms on which it was based, they unhesitatingly\r\nrejected it, and clung to their old Scriptural feudalism. When two\r\ncreeds come into conflict, the older and weaker usually goes under.\r\nBut in this case the men on the losing side were of a peculiar temper\r\nand dwelt in a peculiar country. They took the bold path of carrying\r\nthemselves and their creed to a new land, and so extended its lease of\r\nlife for the better part of a century. Let us take the parallel of the\r\nAmerican Civil War. The North fought for the cause of the larger civic\r\norganism and certain social reforms which were accidentally linked to\r\nit. The South stood for the principle of nationality, and for certain\r\ntraditions of their own particular nationality. Roughly speaking, it\r\nwas the same conflict; but the Southern creed perished because there\r\nwas no practicable hinterland to which it could be transplanted. Had\r\nthere been, I do not think its most stubborn opponents would have\r\ndenied admiration to so bold an endeavour to preserve a national\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nThe Great Trek set its seal upon the new countries. The Orange River\r\nColony and the Transvaal are still in the rural places an emigrant's\r\nland. The farmhouse is the unit; the country dorps are merely jumbles\r\nof little shanties to supply the farmers' wants. The place-names, with\r\nthe endless recurrence of simple descriptive epithets like Sterkstroom\r\nor Klipfontein, or expressions of feeling like Nooitgedacht or\r\nWelgevonden, still tell the tale of the first discoverers. There is\r\nno obscurity in the nomenclature, such as is found in an old land\r\nwhere history has had time to be forgotten. Any farm-boy will tell you\r\nhow this river came to be named the Ox-Yoke or that hill the Place of\r\nWeeping. It has made the people a solemn, ungenial folk, calculating\r\nand thrifty in their ways, and given to living in hovels which suggest\r\nthat here they have no continuing city. Perhaps, as has been said, no\r\nperformance, however stupendous, is worth loss of geniality; and the\r\nfiner graces of life have never had a chance on the veld. There is\r\ngipsy blood in their veins, undying vagabondage behind all their\r\nsleepy contentment. The quiet of the old waggon journeys, when men\r\ncounted the days on a notched stick that they might not miss the still\r\ndeeper quiet of the Sabbaths, has gone into the soul of a race which\r\nstill above all things desires space and leisure. It is this gipsy\r\nendowment which made them born warriors after a fashion; it is this\r\nwhich gives them that apathy in the face of war losses which\r\ndiscomfits their sentimental partisans. Britain in her day has won\r\nmany strange peoples to her Empire; but none, I think, more curious or\r\nmore hopeful than the stubborn children of Uys and Potgieter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [9]   In Lichtenstein's 'Travels in South Africa' (1803-6)\r\n        there is an interesting and comparatively favourable\r\n        account of Buys in his Cape Colony days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE BOER IN SPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fair working rule of life that the behaviour of a man in his\r\nsports is a good index to his character in graver matters. With\r\ncertain reservations the same holds true of a people. For on the\r\nlowest interpretation of the word \"sport,\" the high qualities of\r\ncourage, honour, and self-control are part of the essential equipment,\r\nand the mode in which such qualities appear is a reflex of the\r\nidiosyncrasies of national character. But this is true mainly of the\r\nold settled peoples, whose sports have long lost the grim reality in\r\nwhich they started. To a race which wages daily war with savage nature\r\nthe refinements of conduct are unintelligible; sport becomes business;\r\nand unless there is a hereditary tradition in the matter the fine\r\nmanners of the true hunter's craft are notable by their absence.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while considering the Boer in sport, for it is there he is\r\nseen at his worst. Without tradition of fair play, soured and harassed\r\nby want and disaster, his sport became a matter of commerce, and he\r\nheld no device unworthy in the game. He hunted for the pot, and the\r\npot cast its shadow over all his doings. His arms were rarely in the\r\nold days weapons of precision, and we can scarcely expect much\r\netiquette in the pursuit of elephant or lion in a bush country with a\r\nsmooth-bore gun which had a quaint trajectory and a propensity to\r\nburst. The barbarous ways which he learned in those wild games he\r\nnaturally carried into easier sports. Let us admit, too, that the Boer\r\nrace has produced a few daring and indefatigable hunters, who, though\r\nrarely of the class of a Selous or a Hartley, were yet in every way\r\nworthy of the name of sportsmen. I have talked with old Boers from the\r\nhunting-veld, and in their tales of their lost youth there was a\r\nfervour which the commercial results of their expeditions did not\r\nexplain. But the fact remains that to an Englishman the Boers, with a\r\nfew exceptions, are not a sporting race--they are not even a race of\r\nvery skilful hunters. They came to the land when game was abundant and\r\nthey thinned it out; but the manner of this thinning was as prosaic as\r\nthe routine of their daily lives.\r\n\r\nOne advantage the Boer possessed in common with all dwellers in new\r\nlands--he was familiar from childhood with gun and saddle, and had to\r\nface the world on his own legs from his early boyhood. In this way he\r\nacquired what one might call the psychological equipment of the\r\nhunter. Any one who has hunted in wild countries will remember the\r\nfirst sense of strangeness, the feeling that civilisation had got too\r\nfar away for comfort, which is far more eerie than common nervousness.\r\nTo this feeling the Boer was an utter stranger. It was as natural for\r\nhim to set a trap for a lion before returning at nightfall, or to go\r\noff to the hunting-veld for four winter months, as it was to sow in\r\nspring and reap in autumn. And because it was an incident of his\r\ncommon life he imported into it a ridiculous degree of domesticity. On\r\nhis farm he shot for the pot; on his winter treks with stock to the\r\nbush-veld and the wilder hunting expeditions for skins and horns he\r\ncarried his wife and family in his buck-waggon, built himself a hut\r\nin the wilds, and reproduced exactly the life of the farm. It was easy\r\nto reproduce anywhere, for it was simplicity itself. Mealie-meal,\r\ncoffee, and some coarse tobacco were his supplies, and fresh meat when\r\ngame fell to his gun. So it is not to be wondered at if hunting became\r\nto him something wholly destitute of romance and adventure, an affair\r\nlike kirk and market, where business was the beginning and the end.\r\n\r\nBut besides the Boer who farmed first and hunted afterwards, there was\r\nthe Boer who hunted by profession. The class is almost extinct, but in\r\noutlying farms one may still meet the old hunter and listen to his\r\nincredible tales. Some were men of the first calibre, the pioneers of\r\na dozen districts, men of profound gravity and placid temper, who\r\nrarely told the tale of their deeds. But the common hunter is above\r\nall things a talker. Like the Kaffir, he brags incessantly, and a\r\nlittle flattery will lead him into wild depths. He lies to the\r\nstranger, because he cannot be contradicted; he lies to his friends,\r\nbecause they are connoisseurs in the art and can appreciate the work\r\nof a master. Boer hunting tales, therefore, should be received with\r\nextreme caution. They would often puzzle an expert lawyer, for they\r\nare full of minute and fallacious particulars, skilfully put together,\r\nand forming as a rule a narrative of single-hearted heroism. I have\r\nlistened to a Boer version of a lion-hunt, and I have heard the facts\r\nfrom other members of the same party; and the contrast was a lesson in\r\nthe finer arts of embroidery. But this society had its compensations.\r\nThose men live on the outer fringe of Boerdom; they have no part in\r\npolitics and few ties to the civilised society of Pretoria; and the\r\nresult is that race hatred and memory of old strifes have always had\r\na smaller place in their hearts. Without the virtues of their\r\ncountryman, they are often free from his more unsocial failings.\r\n\r\nIt is as a big-game hunter that he has acquired his reputation, and by\r\nbig game he meant the lion and the elephant, animals which he had to\r\ngo farther afield and run greater risks to secure. The old race of\r\nelephant-hunters were a strong breed, men in whom courage from long\r\nexperience had become a habit; and certainly they had need of it with\r\ntheir long-stocked cumbrous flint-locks, which might put out a man's\r\nshoulder in the recoil. They knew their business and took no needless\r\nrisks, for elephant-hunting is a thing which can be learned. Save in\r\nthick bush, there is little real danger; and if the hunter awaits a\r\ncharging elephant, a point-blank shot at a few yards will generally\r\nmake the animal swerve. Mr Selous, whose authority is beyond question,\r\nhas drawn these men as they appeared to him in Mashonaland--skilful\r\nshikarris, but jealous, uncompanionable, often treacherous as we count\r\nhonour in sport; and Oswell's story is the same. The lion, which, in\r\nspite of tales to the contrary, remains one of the two most dangerous\r\nquarries in the world, was a different affair to them. There was\r\nlittle commercial profit from shooting him, and they had no other\r\nmotive to face danger. Nor can we blame them, for a charging lion to a\r\nman with an uncertain gun means almost as sure destruction as a\r\nshipwreck in mid-ocean. The Boer hunter shot him for protection,\r\nrarely for sport. Very few of the lions killed on the high veld fell\r\nto rifles; a trap-gun set near a drinking-place was the ordinary way\r\nof dealing with them. Mr Ericsen, the most famous of Kalahari\r\npioneers, who brought many herds of Ovampa and Damara cattle across\r\nthe desert, used to tell this story of Boer prowess in lion-hunting.\r\nHe was travelling with a party of Boer hunters, and one night a lion\r\nkilled one of the oxen. The men were in a fury, and urged Mr Ericsen\r\nto follow, bragging that each of them was prepared to tackle the beast\r\nsingle-handed. Mr Ericsen said that he was no hunter, but promised to\r\nlet them have his dogs and natives to follow up the spoor in the\r\nmorning. But when the morning came the party had silently dispersed,\r\nmortally afraid lest they should be expected to fulfil their promises.\r\nIn the long list of South African big-game hunters the names are\r\nmostly English,--Gordon-Cumming, Byles, Hartley, Oswell, Sharpe,\r\nSelous, Francis, John Macdonald,--and the reason does not wholly lie\r\nin the inability and disinclination of the Boer to bring his deeds\r\nfrom the rhetoric of talk to the calmer record of print.\r\n\r\nAt other four-footed game, from the buffalo to the duiker, the Boer\r\nwas generally a fair shot, in some cases a good shot, but very rarely\r\na great shot. Reputation in marksmanship was very much a matter of\r\naccident. A happy fluke with them, as with natives, might make a\r\nreputation for life, though the man in question shot badly ever\r\nafterwards. The number of Boer marksmen of the first rank could be\r\ncounted on the ten fingers. On the other hand, the nature of their\r\nlife produced a very high average. The Boer boy shot from the day he\r\ncould hold a rifle, and there were few utter failures among them. To\r\nbe sure, it was not pretty shooting. His first business was to get the\r\ngame, and if he could do it by sitting on a tree near the stream and\r\nkilling at twenty yards, he did it gladly. When he went hunting he\r\nreflected that his cartridges cost him 3d. apiece, and were all that\r\nstood between him and starvation; so very naturally he became as poky\r\na shot as the English gamekeeper who is sent out to kill for the\r\ntable. If a hunter took out 500 cartridges and brought back 120 head\r\nof game, he was reckoned a good man at his work. To this, of course,\r\nthere were exceptions, such as old Jan Ludig, who once in Waterberg\r\nshot five gnu (who travel in Indian file) within seven miles. The name\r\nof Mr Van Rooyen, too, familiar to all Matabele hunters, shows what\r\nthe Dutch race can produce in the way of marksmanship and veld-craft.\r\nIn one branch of the chase they were consummate masters. The Boer\r\nmethod of stalking is an art by itself, for it is really a kind of\r\ndriving, by showing oneself at strategic points till the game is\r\nforced into suitable ground. In open country they also followed with\r\ngreat success the method of riding down. Mounted on a good shooting\r\npony, the hunter galloped alongside a herd till he was within\r\nreasonable distance; then in a trice he was on the ground, had\r\nselected his animal, and fired--all within a few seconds. This was a\r\nrisky game for a large party, owing to the very rude etiquette which\r\nprevailed on the subject of shooting in your neighbour's direction;\r\nand I have heard of many seriously wounded and even killed by their\r\ncompanions' shots. Still another way was to ride alongside an animal\r\nand shoot him from the saddle at a few paces' distance. This was\r\ncalled \"brandt\" or \"burning,\" and required a firm seat and a very\r\nsteady eye.\r\n\r\nBirds were thought little of, except by some of the more advanced\r\nfarmers and by sportsmen from the towns. The country is full of many\r\nexcellent sporting birds: guineafowl, quail, francolin, duck, geese,\r\nand several kinds of partridge and bustard; but though a few farmers\r\nshot wildfowl on their dams, the average Boer was a poor shot with a\r\ngun, and when he did use one he liked to take his birds sitting. A\r\nhunter might kill a bird neatly with a rifle, which he would miss at\r\nshorter range with a shot-gun. This fashion is quickly passing. Many\r\nfarmers possess excellent guns of the latest pattern; and I have known\r\nBoers who could hold their own with credit in Norfolk or Perthshire.\r\nAs shooting is becoming more of a sport and less of a business,\r\netiquette is growing up; and the Boer is learning to spare does and\r\newes and take pleasure in hard shots, where his father would have\r\nslaughtered casually and walked long and far to spare his cartridges.\r\nThe new order is bringing better manners, but nothing can restore the\r\nnoble herds of game which fell unlamented and unnoted under the old\r\n_regime_.\r\n\r\nOther sports were scarcely considered. He rarely fished, leaving the\r\ncatching of yellow-fish, tiger-fish, and barbel to the Kaffirs; and\r\nwhen he did, his rod and tackle were neolithic in their simplicity. I\r\nhave never seen a Boer rod which had any of the proper attributes of a\r\nrod, and he used to profess scorn for a man with a greenheart or a\r\nsplit-cane as for one who would stipulate for an elegant spade before\r\ndigging potatoes. Sometimes in a village or among neighbouring farmers\r\nflat-races would be got up; but the Boer pony was bred more for\r\nendurance than for speed, and a small selling-plate meeting was about\r\nthe limit of his horse-racing. I have never seen or heard of a Boer\r\nsteeplechase. On the other hand, he had a wonderful skill, as our army\r\ndiscovered, in riding at full speed over a breakneck country,--a skill\r\ndue, perhaps, more to veld-craft than to horsemanship. Hunting big\r\ngame on horseback taught him, as part of the business, to leave much\r\nto his horse; and his horse rarely played him false. Whether he was\r\nclattering down a stony hillside, or dodging through thick scrub, or\r\nracing over veld honeycombed with ant-bear holes, he rode with a loose\r\nrein and full confidence in his animal. It is difficult to frame an\r\nopinion on his horsemanship. His long stirrups, the easy \"tripple\" of\r\nhis horse, and his loose seat make him a type of horseman very\r\ndifferent to our cavalryman or Leicestershire master of hounds. But,\r\nloose as he sits, he can stick on over most kinds of country, and he\r\nis a natural horsemaster of the first order. A Boer knows by instinct\r\nhow to manage his horse: he never frets him; he rarely ill-treats him;\r\nand he can judge to a mile the limits of his endurance.\r\n\r\nAs a sportsman, then, the Boer is scarcely at his best. He has shown\r\nhimself dull, sluggish, unimaginative, capable of both skill and\r\nendurance, but a niggard in the exercise of either, unless compelled by\r\nhunger or hope of gain. Unlike most races, it is in his sports that he\r\nshows his most unlovely traits, and that flat incomprehensible side of\r\nhis character which has puzzled an ornamental world. The truth is that\r\nhe is, speaking broadly, without imagination and that dash of adventure\r\nwhich belongs to all imaginative men. The noble spurs of the\r\nDrakensberg rose within sight of his home; but he would as soon have\r\nthought of climbing a peak for the sport or the scenery as of dabbling\r\nin water-colours. A dawn was to him only the beginning of the day, a\r\nmellow veld sunset merely a sign to outspan; and I should be afraid to\r\nguess his thoughts on a primrose by the river's brim, or whatever is\r\nthe South African equivalent. His religion made him credulous, but his\r\ntemperament transformed the most stupendous of the world's histories\r\ninto a kind of Farmer's Almanac, and Eastern poetry became for him a\r\nliteral record of fact. A friend of mine, travelling with a Boer hunter\r\nin the far north, called his attention to the beauty of the starry\r\nnight, and, thinking to interest his companion, told him a few simple\r\nastronomical truths. The Boer angrily asked him why he lied so\r\nfoolishly. \"Do not I read in the Book,\" he said, \"that the world stands\r\non four pillars?\" And when my friend inquired about the foundation of\r\nthe pillars, the Boer sulked for two days. But there is one trait which\r\nhe shared with all true sportsmen, a love of wild animals. To be sure,\r\nthe finest reserves of buck were made by new-comers, such as Mr van der\r\nByl's park at Irene and Mr Forbes's at Athole, in Ermelo, both\r\nunhappily ruined by the war. But many veld farmers had their small\r\nreserves of springbok or blesbok, and permitted no hunting within them.\r\nSome did it as a speculation, being always ready to lease a day's\r\nshooting to a gun from Johannesburg, and many for the reason that they\r\nsought big farms and complete solitude--to pander to a sense of\r\npossession. But in all, perhaps, there was a strain of honest pleasure\r\nin wild life, a desire to encircle their homes with the surroundings\r\nof their early hunting days. In which case, it is another of the\r\nanomalies which warn us off hasty generalisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE BOER IN ALL SERIOUSNESS.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boer character has suffered by its simplicity. It has, as a rule,\r\nbeen crudely summed up in half a dozen denunciatory sentences, or, in\r\nthe case of more curious students, it has been analysed and defined\r\nwith a subtlety for which there is no warrant. A hasty condemnation is\r\nnot the method for a product so full of difficulty and interest, and a\r\nchain of laborious paradoxes scarcely enables us to comprehend a thing\r\nwhich is pre-eminently broad and simple. The Boer has rarely been\r\nunderstood by people who give their impressions to the world, but he\r\nhas been very completely understood by plain men who have dwelt beside\r\nhim and experienced his ways in the many relations of life. It is easy\r\nto dismiss him with a hostile epigram; easy, too, to build up an\r\nedifice of neat contradictions, after the fashion of what Senancour\r\nhas called \"le vulgaire des sages,\" and label it the Boer character.\r\nThe first way commends itself to party feeling; the second appeals to\r\na nation which has confessedly never understood its opponents, and is\r\nready now to admit its ignorance and excuse itself by the amazing\r\ncomplexity of the subject. Sympathy, which is the only path to true\r\nunderstanding, was made difficult by the mists of war, and, when all\r\nwas over, by the exceeding dreariness of the conquered people. There\r\nwas little romance in the slouching bearded men with flat faces and\r\nlustreless eyes who handed in their rifles and came under our flag;\r\nNational Scouts, haggling over money terms, and the begging tour of\r\nthe generals, seemed to have reduced honour to a matter of shillings\r\nand pence, and dispelled the glamour of many hard-fought battlefields.\r\nThere is a perennial charm about an _ancien regime_; but this poor\r\n_ancien regime_ had no purple and fine gold for the sentimental--only\r\na hodden-grey burgess society, an unlovely Kirk, and a prosaic\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the proper understanding of this character is of the first\r\npolitical importance, and a task well worth undertaking for its own\r\nsake. Those men are for ever our neighbours and fellow-citizens, and\r\nit is the part of wisdom to understand the present that it may prepare\r\nagainst the future. To the amateur of racial character there is the\r\nchance of reading in the largest letters the lesson of historical\r\ndevelopment, for we know their antecedents, we can see clearly the\r\nsimple events of their recent history, and we have before us a\r\nproduct, as it were, isolated and focussed for observation. Nor can\r\nsympathy be wanting in a fair observer,--sympathy for courage,\r\ntenacity of purpose, a simple fidelity to racial ideals. No man who\r\nhas lived much with the people can regard them without a little\r\naversion, a strong liking, and a large and generous respect.\r\n\r\nIn any racial inquiry there are certain determinant factors which form\r\nthe axioms of the problem. In the case of a long-settled people these\r\nare so intricate and numerous that it is impossible to disentangle\r\nmore than a few of the more obvious, and we explain development,\r\nnaturally and logically, rather by the conscious principles which the\r\nrace assimilated than by the objective forces which acted upon it from\r\nthe outer world. But in the case of a savage or a backward nation, the\r\nhistory is simple, the ingredients in racial character few and\r\nintelligible. The wars of the spirit and the growth of philosophies\r\nare potent influences, but their history is speculative and recondite.\r\nBut the struggle for bare life falls always in simple forms, and\r\nphysical forces leave their mark rudely upon the object they work on.\r\nIn this case we have a national life less than a century long, a mode\r\nof society all but uniform, a creed short and unsophisticated, an\r\nintelligible descent, and a country which stamps itself readily upon\r\nits people. Origin, history, natural environment, accidental modes of\r\ncivilisation, these are the main factors in that composite thing we\r\ncall character. We can read them in the individual: we can read them\r\nwrit large in a race which is little more than the individual writ\r\nlarge. In complex societies the composition is a chemical process, the\r\nresult is a new product, not to be linked with any ingredient; the\r\nsoul and mind of the populace is something different in kind from the\r\naverage soul and mind of its units. But in this collection of hardy\r\nindividualists there was no novel result, and the type is repeated\r\nwith such scanty variations that we may borrow the attributes of the\r\nindividual for our definition of the race.\r\n\r\nDescent, history, natural environment have laid the foundation of the\r\nBoer character. The old sluggish Batavian stock (not of the best\r\nquality, for the first settlers were as a rule of the poorest and\r\nleast reputable class) was leavened with a finer French strain, and\r\ntinctured with a little native blood. Living a clannish life in\r\nsolitude, the people intermarried closely, and suffered the fate of\r\ninbreeders in a loss of facial variety and a gradual coarsening of\r\nfeature. Their history was a record of fierce warfare with savage\r\nnature, and the evolution of a peculiar set of traditions which soon\r\ncame into opposition with imported European ideas. They evolved,\r\npartly from the needs of their society and partly from distorted\r\nechoes of revolutionary dogma, an embryo political creed, and in\r\nreligion they established a variant of sixteenth-century Protestantism.\r\nTheir life, and the vast spaces of earth and sky amid which they lived,\r\nstrengthened the patriarchal individualism in their blood. The whole\r\nprocess of development, so remote from the common racial experience,\r\nproduced in the Boer character a tissue of contradictions which resist\r\nall attempts at an easy summary. He was profoundly religious, with the\r\nlanguage of piety always on his lips, and yet deeply sunk in matter.\r\nWithout imagination, he had the habits of a recluse and in a coarse way\r\nthe instincts of the poet. He was extremely narrow in a bargain, and\r\nextremely hospitable. With a keen sense of justice, he connived at\r\ncorruption and applauded oppression. A severe moral critic, he was\r\noften lax, and sometimes unnatural, in his sexual relations. He was\r\nbrave in sport and battle, but his heroics had always a mercantile\r\nbasis, and he would as soon die for an ideal, as it is commonly\r\nunderstood, as sell his farm for a sixpence. There were few virtues or\r\nvices which one could deny him utterly or with which one could credit\r\nhim honestly. In short, the typical Boer to the typical observer\r\nbecame a sort of mixture of satyr, Puritan, and successful merchant,\r\nrather interesting, rather distasteful, and wholly incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the phenomenon is perfectly normal. The Boer is a representative\r\non a grand scale of a type which no nation is without. He is the\r\nordinary backward countryman, more backward and more of a countryman\r\nthan is usual in our modern world. At one time this was the current\r\nview--a \"race of farmers,\" a \"pastoral folk\"; but the early months of\r\nthe war brought about a reversal of judgment, and he was credited with\r\nthe most intricate urban vices. Such a false opinion was the result of a\r\ntoo conventional view of the rural character. There is nothing Arcadian\r\nabout the Boer, as there is certainly nothing Arcadian about the average\r\npeasant. A Corot background, a pastoral pipe, and a flavour of\r\nhoneysuckle, must be expelled from the picture. To analyse what is\r\ngrandiloquently called the \"folk-heart,\" is to see in its rude virtues\r\nand vices an exact replica of the life of the veld. \"Simple\" and\r\n\"pastoral,\" on a proper understanding of the terms, are the last words\r\nin definition.\r\n\r\nLet us take an average household. Jan Celliers (pronounced Seljee)\r\nlives on his farm of 3000 morgen with his second wife and a family of\r\ntwelve. His father was a voortrekker, and the great Sarel was a\r\nfar-out cousin. Two cousins of his mother and their families squat as\r\nbywoners on his land, and an orphan daughter of his sister lives in\r\nhis household. The farmhouse is built of sun-dried bricks, whitewashed\r\nin front, and consists of a small kitchen, a large room which is\r\nparlour and dining-room in one, and three small chambers where the\r\nfamily sleep. Twelve families of natives live in a little kraal,\r\ncultivate their own mealie-patches, and supply the labour of the farm,\r\nwhile two half-caste Cape boys, Andries and Abraham, who attend to the\r\nhorses, have a rude shanty behind the stable. Jan has a dam from\r\nwhich he irrigates ten acres of mealies, pumpkins, and potatoes. For\r\nthe rest he has 500 Afrikander oxen, which make him a man of substance\r\namong his neighbours, including two spans of matched beasts, fawn and\r\nblack, for which he has refused an offer of L30 apiece. He is not an\r\nactive farmer, for he does not need to bestir himself. His land yields\r\nhim with little labour enough to live on, and a biscuit-tin full of\r\nmoney, buried in the orchard below the fifth apricot-tree from the\r\nhouse, secures his mind against an evil day. But he likes to ride\r\nround his herds in the early morning, and to smoke his pipe in his\r\nmealie-patch of a late afternoon. He is not fond of neighbours, but it\r\nis pleasant to him once in a while to go to Pretoria and buy a\r\ncartload of fancy groceries and the very latest plough in the store.\r\nAs a boy Jan was a great hunter, and has been with his father to the\r\nLimpopo and the Rooi Rand; but of late game has grown scarce, and Jan\r\nis not the fellow to stir himself to find it. Now and then he shoots a\r\nspringbok, and brags wonderfully about his shots, quite regardless of\r\nthe presence of his sons who accompany him. These sons are heavy\r\nloutish boys, finer shots by far than Jan, for they have that\r\ninfallible eyesight of the Boer youth. They, too, are idle, and are\r\nmuch abused by their mother, when she is wide awake enough to look\r\nafter them. The daughters are plump and shapeless, with pallid\r\ncomplexions inside their sun-bonnets, and a hoydenish shyness towards\r\nneighbours. Not that they see many neighbours, though rumour has it\r\nthat young Coos Pretorius, son of the rich Pretorius, comes now and\r\nthen to \"opsitten\" with the eldest girl. Jan believes in an Old\r\nTestament God, whom he hears of at nachtmaals, for the kirk is too far\r\noff for the ordinary Sabbath-day's journey; but he believes much more\r\nin a spook which lives in the old rhinoceros-hole in the spruit, and\r\nin his own amazing merits. He is sleepily good-natured towards the\r\nworld, save to a Jew storekeeper in the town who calls himself on the\r\nsign above his door the \"Old Boer's Friend,\" and on one occasion\r\ncheated him out of L5. But Jan has also had his triumphs, notably when\r\nhe induced a coal prospector to prospect in an impossible place and\r\nleave him, free of cost, an excellent well. When war broke out Jan and\r\nthree of his sons, sorely against their will, went out on commando.\r\nTwo of the boys went to Ceylon, one fell at Spionkop, and Jan himself\r\nremained in the field till the end, and came back as proud as a\r\npeacock to repatriation rations. His womenfolk were in the Middelburg\r\nBurgher camp, where they acquired a taste for society which almost\r\nconquered their love for the farm. At any rate, it was with bitter\r\ncomplaints that they sat again under a makeshift roof, with no\r\nneighbours except the korhaan and a span of thin repatriation oxen.\r\nJan did not enjoy war. At first he was desperately afraid, and only\r\nthe strangeness of the country and the presence of others kept him\r\nfrom trekking for home. By-and-by he found amusement in the sport of\r\nthe thing, and realised that with caution he might keep pretty well\r\nout of the way of harm. But in the guerilla warfare of the last year\r\nthere was no sport, only stark unrelieved misery. Sometimes he thought\r\nof slipping over to the enemy and surrendering; often he wished he had\r\nbeen captured and sent to Ceylon with his boys; but something which he\r\ndid not understand and had never suspected before began to rise in his\r\nsoul, a wild obstinacy and a resolve to stand out to the last. Once in\r\na night attack he was chased by two mounted infantrymen, and turned to\r\nbay in a narrow place, shooting one man and wounding the other badly.\r\nHe did his best for the sufferer before making off to the rendezvous,\r\nan incident which has appeared in the picture papers (Jan is depicted\r\nabout eight feet high, with a face like Moses, whereas he really is a\r\nbroken-nosed little man), and which shows that he had both courage and\r\nkindness somewhere in his slow soul. But he gladly welcomed peace; he\r\nhad never cared greatly for politics, and had an ancestral grudge\r\nagainst the Kruger family; and when he had assured himself that,\r\ninstead of losing all, he would get most of his property back, and\r\nperhaps a little for interest, he became quite loyal, and figured\r\nprominently on the local repatriation board. He takes the resident\r\nmagistrate out shooting, and has just sold to the Government a\r\nfraction of his farm at an enormous profit.\r\n\r\nSuch is an ordinary type of our new citizens. If we look at him the\r\ntypical countryman stands out clear from the mists of tortuous\r\npsychology. It is an error, doubtless, to assume that the primitive\r\nnature is always simple; it is often bewilderingly complex. An\r\nelaborate civilisation may produce a type which can be analysed under\r\na dozen categories; while the savage or the backwoodsman may show a\r\nnetwork of curiously interlaced motives. But the man is familiar. We\r\nknow others of the family; we have met him in the common relations of\r\nlife; he stands before us as a concrete human being.\r\n\r\nHis most obvious characteristic is his mental sluggishness. Dialectic\r\nrarely penetrates the chain-armour of his prejudices. He has nothing\r\nof the keen receptive mind which, like a sensitive plant, is open to\r\nall the influences of life. His views are the outcome of a long and\r\nsluggish growth, and cling like mandrakes to the roots of his being.\r\nHe makes no deductions from ordinary events, and he never follows a\r\nthing to its logical conclusion. His blind faith requires a cataclysm\r\nto shake it, and to revise a belief is impossible for him save under\r\nthe stress of pain. Death and burning towns may reveal to him a\r\nprinciple, but unless it is written large in letters of blood and fire\r\nit escapes his stagnant intelligence. Change is painful to all human\r\ncreatures, but such coercion of change is doubly painful, since he has\r\nno scheme of thought into which it can fit, and it means, therefore,\r\nthe upturning of the foundations of his world. But the countryman,\r\nwhile he holds tenaciously his innermost beliefs, has a vast capacity\r\nfor doing lip-service to principles which he does not understand. He\r\nsees that certain shibboleths command respect and bring material gain,\r\nso he glibly adopts them without allowing them for a moment to\r\nencroach upon the cherished arcana of his faith. Hence comes the\r\napparent inconsistency of many simple folk. The Boer had a dozen\r\nprinciples which he would gladly sell to the highest bidder; but he\r\nhad some hundreds of prejudices which he held dearer (almost) than\r\nlife. His principles were European importations, democratic political\r\ndogmas, which he used to excellent purpose without caring or\r\nunderstanding, moral maxims which bore no relation to his own ragged\r\nand twisted ethics. The mild international morality which his leaders\r\nwere wont to use as a reproach to Britain seems comically out of place\r\nwhen we reflect upon the high-handed international code, born of\r\nfilibustering and Kaffir wars, which he found in the Scriptures and\r\nhad long ago adopted for his own. His political confession of faith,\r\nwhich the framers of his constitution had borrowed from Europe and\r\nAmerica, with its talk of representation and equal rights and\r\ndelegated powers, contrasted oddly with the fierce individualism which\r\nwas his innermost conviction, and the cabals and \"spoils to the\r\nvictor\" policy which made up his daily practice. His religion had a\r\nlike character. In its essentials it was the same which a generation or\r\ntwo ago held sway over Galloway peasants and Hebridean fishermen; but\r\nthe results were very different. The stern hard-bitten souls who saw\r\nthe devil in most of the works of God, and lived ever under a great\r\nTaskmaster's eye, had no kinship with the easy-going sleek-lipped Boer\r\npiety. The Boer religion in practice was a judicious excerpt from the\r\neasier forms of Christianity, while its theory was used to buttress his\r\nself-sufficiency and mastery over weaker neighbours. His political\r\ncreed may be stated shortly as a belief in his right to all new\r\nterritories in which he set foot, his indefeasible right to control the\r\nnative tribes in the way he thought best, a denial of all right of the\r\nState to interfere with him, but an assertion of the duty of the State\r\nto enrich him. To these cardinal articles liberty, equality, and\r\nfraternity were added as an elegant appendage before publication. So,\r\ntoo, in his religion: God made man of two colours, white and black,\r\nthe former to rule the latter till the end of time; God led Israel out\r\nof Egypt and gave to them new lands for their inalienable heritage;\r\nany Egyptian who followed was the apportioned prey of the chosen\r\npeople, and it was a duty to spoil him; this beneficent God must\r\ntherefore be publicly recognised and frequently referred to in the\r\nspeech of daily life, but in the case of the Elect considerable\r\nlatitude may be allowed in the practice of the commandments,--such may\r\nfairly be taken as the ordinary unformulated Boer creed. But, as the\r\nstatement was too short and bare, all the finer virtues had to be\r\nattached in public profession.\r\n\r\nA countryman lives in a narrow world which he knows intimately, but\r\nbeyond is an unexplored region which he knows of by hearsay and\r\nfears. He is not naturally suspicious. Among his fellows he is often\r\nconfiding to a fault, and a little acquaintance with a dreaded object\r\nwill often result in a revulsion to contempt. The Boer has in a\r\npeculiar degree this characteristic of rural peoples. He has an\r\nimmense awe of an alien Power while he does not know it, but once let\r\nit commit itself to some weakness, and the absence of all mental\r\nperspective changes the exaggerated awe into an equally exaggerated\r\ncondescension. This truth is written clear over the whole history of\r\nEngland in Africa. A lost battle, a political withdrawal, a wavering\r\nstatesman, have had moral effects of incalculable significance. The\r\nburgher who opposed us with terror and despair became at the first\r\ngleam of success a screeching cock-of-the-walk, and this attitude,\r\njealously fostered, obscured the world to him for the rest of his\r\ndays. In our threats he saw bluster, in our kindness he read\r\nweakness, in our diplomacy folly; and he went out at last with the\r\nfullest confidence, which three years of misery have scarcely\r\nuprooted. This is one side of the parochial mind; the other is the\r\nsuspicion which became his attitude to everything beyond his beacons.\r\nIt is not the proverbial \"slimness\"; that graceful quality is merely\r\nthe rustic cunning which he thought the foundation of business, a\r\nquality as common on Australian stock-runs and Scottish sheep-farms.\r\nHis suspicion was his own peculiar possession, born of his history\r\nand his race, and, above all, of his intercourse with native tribes.\r\nHe did not give his confidence readily, as who would if he believed\r\nthat the world was in league against him? New ideas, new faces, new\r\ninventions were all put on his black list. Like Mr By-ends, he found\r\nhis principles easy and profitable, and was resolved to stick to\r\nthem. Two forces, however, tended to undermine his distrust. One was\r\nhis intense practicality. If his principles ceased to be profitable,\r\nhe was prepared, against the grain, to consider emendations. The\r\nsecond was his crude pleasure in novelties, the curious delight of a\r\nchild in a mechanical toy. A musical box, a portrait of Mr Kruger\r\nwhich, when wound up, emitted the Volkslied, or the latest variety of\r\nmealie-crusher, were attractions which he had no power to resist.\r\n\r\nAt the root of all his traits lies a meagre imagination. In religion\r\nhe turns the stupendous tales of Scripture into a parish chronicle,\r\nwith God as a benevolent burgomaster and Moses and the prophets as\r\nglorified landrosts. In politics no Boer since President Burgers saw\r\nthings with a large vision, and his rhetorical dreams were folly to\r\nhis countrymen. The idea of a great Afrikander state, very vigorously\r\nheld elsewhere in South Africa, had small hold on the ordinary\r\npopulation of the Republics, save upon sons of English fathers or\r\nmothers, half-educated journalists, and European officials. In the\r\nwars which he waged he saw little of the murky splendour which covers\r\nthe horrors of death. The pageantry of the veld was nothing to him,\r\nand in the amenities of life he scarcely advanced beyond bare physical\r\ncomfort. He had neither art nor literature. If we except Mr Reitz's\r\ndelightful verses, which at their happiest are translations of Burns\r\nand Scott, he had not even the songs which are commonly found among\r\nrural peoples. His nursery tales and his few superstitions were\r\nborrowed from the Kaffir. On one side only do we discern any trace of\r\nimaginative power. Somehow at the back of his soul was the love of\r\nthe wilds and the open road--a call which, after years of settled\r\nlife, had still power to stir the blood of the old hunter. He was not\r\ngood at pictorial forecasts, but he had one retrospect stamped on his\r\nbrain, and this hunger for old days was a spark of fire which kept\r\nwarm a corner of his being.\r\n\r\nThe typical countryman he remains, typical in his limitations and the\r\nvices which followed them. The chief was his incurable mendacity.\r\nTruth-speaking is always a relative virtue, being to some men an easy\r\nhabit, and to others of a livelier fancy a constant and strenuous\r\neffort. The Boer is not brutal, he is eminently law-abiding and sober,\r\nand kindly in most of the relations of life. He has the rustic\r\nlooseness in sexual morals, and in the remoter farmhouses this\r\nlooseness often took the form of much hideous and unnatural vice. But\r\nthe cardinal fault, obvious to the most casual observer, is a contempt\r\nfor truth in every guise. Masterful liars, who have held their own in\r\nmost parts of the world, are vanquished by the systematic perjury of\r\nthe veld. The habit is, no doubt, partly learned from the Kaffir, a\r\nfine natural professor of the art; but to its practice the Boer\r\nbrought a stolid patience, an impassive countenance, and a limited\r\nimagination which kept him consistent. He bragged greatly, since to a\r\nsolitary man with a high self-esteem this is the natural mode of\r\nemphasising his personality on the rare occasions when he mixes with\r\nhis fellows. He lied in business for sound practical reasons. He lied\r\nat home by the tacit consent of his household. The truest way to\r\noutwit him, as many found, was to tell him the naked truth, since his\r\nsuspicion saw in every man his own duplicity. But because he is a true\r\ncountryman, when once he has proved a man literally truthful he will\r\ntrust him with a pathetic simplicity. There were Englishmen in the\r\nland before the war, as there are Englishmen to-day, whose word to the\r\nBoer mind was an inviolable oath.\r\n\r\nSo far I have described the average Boer failings with all the\r\nunsympathetic plainness which a hostile observer could desire. But\r\nthere is a very different side to which it is pleasant to turn. If he\r\nhas the countryman's faults strongly developed, he has also in a high\r\ndegree the country virtues. Simplicity is not an unmixed blessing; but\r\nit is the mother of certain fine qualities, which are apt to be lost\r\nsight of by a sophisticated world. He could live bare and sleep hard\r\nwhen the need arose; and if he was sluggish in his daily life it was\r\nthe indolence of the sleepy natural world and not the enervation of\r\ndecadence. Because his needs were few he was supremely adaptable: a\r\nborn pioneer, with his household gods in a waggon and his heart\r\nturning naturally to the wilds. The grandeur of nature was lost on\r\nhim; but there is a certain charm in the way in which he brought all\r\nthings inside the pale of his domesticity. His homely images have\r\ntheir own picturesqueness, as when he called the morning star, which\r\nsummoned him to inspan, the _voorlooper_, or \"little boy who leads out\r\nthe oxen.\" It is the converse of sublimity, and itself not unsublime.\r\nHis rude dialect, almost as fine as lowland Scots for telling country\r\nstories, is full of metaphors, so to speak, in solution, often coarse,\r\nbut always the fruit of direct and vigorous observation. In short, he\r\nhad a personality which stands out simply in all his doings, making\r\nhim a living clear-cut figure among the amorphous shades of the indoor\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWild tales and judicious management from Pretoria succeeded in\r\ncombining him temporarily into a semblance of a state and a very\r\nformidable reality of an army; but at bottom he is the most dogmatic\r\nindividualist in the world. His allegiance was never to a chief or a\r\nstate, but to his family. The family was generously interpreted, so\r\nthat distant relations came within its fold. This clannishness has not\r\nbeen sufficiently recognised; but it is a real social force, and of\r\ngreat importance to a survey of Boer society. In the country farms,\r\nwith their system of bywoners, a whole cycle of relations lived, all\r\ndepending upon the head of the household for their subsistence. When\r\nsons or daughters married they lived on in the homestead, and as their\r\nchildren grew up and married in turn they squatted on a corner of the\r\nfarm. The system led to abuses, notably in the ridiculous subdivision\r\nof land and the endless servitudes and burdens imposed on real estate;\r\nbut it relieved the community of any need for orphanages and\r\nworkhouses. The Boer's treatment of orphans does him much credit.\r\nHowever poor, a family would make room for orphaned children, and\r\nthere was no distinction in their usage. It is a primitive virtue, a\r\nheritage from the days when white folk were few in numbers: a little\r\nfamily in the heart of savagery, bound together by a common origin and\r\na common fear.\r\n\r\nBut his chief virtue was his old-fashioned hospitality. A stranger\r\nrarely knocked at his gates in vain. You arrived at a farmhouse and\r\nasked leave to outspan by the spruit. Permission was freely granted,\r\nand in a little girls came out with coffee for the travellers. An\r\ninvitation to supper usually followed, and there is no better fare in\r\nthe world than a chicken roasted by a Boer housewife and her home-made\r\nsausages. Then followed slow talk over deep-bowled pipes, and then\r\ngood-night, with much handshaking and good wishes. And so all over\r\nthe veld. The family might be wretchedly poor, but they dutifully and\r\ncheerfully gave what they had. In the early months of peace it was a\r\ncommon thing to come on a Boer family living in a hut of biscuit tins\r\nor a torn tent, with scanty rations and miserably ragged clothes. But\r\nthose people, in most cases, set the little they had gladly before the\r\nstranger. The Boer, who will perjure himself deeply to save a\r\nshilling, will part with a pound's worth of entertainment without a\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a host, he has a natural dignity beyond praise. A placid life,\r\nbacked by an overwhelming sense of worth, is a fine basis for good\r\nmanners. Boastfulness and prejudice may come later, but the first\r\nimpression is of an antique kindliness and ease. The veld has no\r\nnerves, no uneasy consciousness of inferiority, least of all the\r\ncringing friendliness of the low European. The farmer, believing in\r\nnothing beyond his ken, makes the stranger welcome as a harmless\r\ncourier from a trivial world. No contrast can be more vivid than\r\nbetween the nervous, bustling cosmopolitans who throng the Rand and\r\nthe silent veld-dwellers. The Boer type of countenance is not often\r\nhandsome; frequently it is flat and expressionless, lustreless grey\r\neyes with small pupils, and hair growing back from chin and lip. But\r\nit is almost always the embodiment of repose, and in the finer stock\r\nit sometimes reaches an archaic and patriarchal dignity. The same\r\npraise cannot be given to the _jeunesse doree_ of the Afrikander\r\nworld, who acquired the smattering of an education and migrated to the\r\ntowns. Ignorant, swaggering, mentally and bodily underbred, they form\r\na distressing class of people who have somehow missed civilisation and\r\nhit upon the vulgarity of its decline. They claim glibly and falsely\r\nthe virtues which their fathers possessed without advertisement. Much\r\nof the bad blood and spurious nationalism in the country comes from\r\nthis crew, who, in partnership with the worst type of European\r\nadventurer, have done their best to discredit their nation. The true\r\ncountry Boer regards them much as the silent elder Mirabeau and\r\nZachary Macaulay must have regarded their voluble sons--with\r\nconsiderable distrust, a little disfavour, and not a little secret\r\nadmiration for a trick which has no place in his world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnderstanding is the only basis of a policy towards this remarkable\r\nsection of our fellow-citizens--understanding, and a decent abstinence\r\nfrom subtleties. We used to flatter our souls that we created our\r\nEmpire in a fit of absent-mindedness, and in all our troubles convinced\r\nourselves that we were destined to \"muddle through.\" But there are\r\nlimits to this policy of serene trust in Providence, and it is rather\r\nour duty to thank God we have taken so few falls, and brace our minds\r\nto forethought and prudence. The Boer is the easiest creature in the\r\nworld to govern. He is naturally law-abiding, and he has an enormous\r\nrespect for the accomplished fact. True union may take long, but the\r\nnominal amalgamation which is necessary for smooth government already\r\nexists. We must understand how slow he is to learn, how deep his pride\r\nis, how lively his suspicions. Spiritually he will be a slow pupil, but\r\nwith proper care politically he may be a ready learner. He has a\r\ncuriously acute sense of justice, which makes him grumble at\r\ncompulsion, but obey, and end by applauding. He is also quick to\r\nrealise what is competent and successful in administration. He will\r\ngive everything a fair trial, waiting, watching, and forming his slow\r\nmind; and if a thing is a practical fiasco, he will laugh at it in the\r\nend. The practical is the last touchstone for him. He is not easily\r\nmade drunk with the ideals of ordinary democracy; an efficient\r\ngovernment, however naked of adornments, will always command his\r\nrespect, and the fool, though buttressed with every sublime aspiration,\r\nwill find him adamant. To a government which can estimate the situation\r\nsoberly and face it manfully he is a simple problem. But he will be a\r\nhard critic of weakness, and when once his laggard opinions are formed\r\nit will be a giant's task to shake them. The war has broken his old\r\narrogance, and he now waits to make up his mind on the new _regime_. We\r\nshall get justice from him from the start--laborious justice and\r\nnothing more. If we fail, all the honesty of purpose on earth will not\r\nsave us; for to the Boer good intentions may preserve a man's soul in\r\nanother world, but they cannot excuse him in this one. There is much\r\npractical truth in Bunyan's parable when he makes Old Honest come \"from\r\nthe town of Stupidity,\" which town \"lieth four degrees _beyond_ the\r\nCity of Destruction.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Boer is once won to our side we shall have secured one of the\r\ngreatest colonising forces in the world. We can ask for no better\r\ndwellers upon a frontier. If the plateaux of our Central and East\r\nAfrican possessions are to be permanently held by the white man, I\r\nbelieve it will be by this people who have never turned their back\r\nupon a country which seemed to promise good pasture-land. Other races\r\nsend forth casual pioneers, who return and report and then go\r\nelsewhere; but the Boer takes his wife and family and all his\r\nbelongings, and in a decade is part of the soil. In the midst of any\r\nsavagery he will plant his rude domesticity, and the land is won. With\r\nall her colonising activity, Britain can ill afford to lose from her\r\nflag a force so masterful, persistent, and sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [10]  The word \"Boer\" is used in this chapter to denote the\r\n        average country farmer in the new colonies, and not the\r\n        educated Dutch of the towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nNOTES OF TRAVEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nEVENING ON THE HIGH VELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe leave the broken highway, channelled by rains and rutted by\r\nox-waggons, and plunge into the leafy coolness of a great wood. Great\r\nin circumference only, for the blue gums and pines and mimosa-bushes\r\nare scarcely six years old, though the feathery leafage and the\r\nfrequency of planting make a thicket of the young trees. The rides\r\nare broad and grassy as an English holt, dipping into hollows,\r\nclimbing steep ridges, and showing at intervals little side-alleys,\r\nending in green hills, with the accompaniment everywhere of the spicy\r\nsmell of gums and the deep rooty fragrance of pines. Sometimes all\r\nalien woodland ceases, and we ride through aisles of fine trees,\r\nwhich have nothing save height to distinguish them from Rannoch or\r\nRothiemurchus. A deer looks shyly out, which might be a roebuck; the\r\ncooing of doves, the tap of a woodpecker, even the hawk above in the\r\nblue heavens, have nothing strange. Only an occasional widow-bird\r\nwith its ridiculous flight, an ant-heap to stumble over, and a clump\r\nof scarlet veld-flowers are there to mark the distinction. Here we\r\nhave the sign visible of man's conquest over the soil, and of the\r\nreal adaptability of the land. With care and money great tracts of\r\nthe high-veld might change their character. An English country-house,\r\nwith deer-park and coverts and fish-ponds, could be created here and\r\nin many kindred places, where the owner might forget his continent.\r\nAnd in time this will happen. As the rich man pushes farther out from\r\nthe city for his home, he will remake the most complaisant of\r\ncountries to suit his taste, and, save for climate and a certain\r\nineradicable flora and fauna, patches of Surrey and Perthshire will\r\nappear on this kindly soil.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the wood we come out upon the veld. What is this\r\nmysterious thing, this veld, so full of memories for the English race,\r\nso omnipresent, so baffling? Like the words \"prairie,\" \"moor,\" and\r\n\"down,\" it is easy to make a rough mental picture of. It will doubtless\r\nbecome in time, when South Africa gets herself a literature, a\r\nconventional counter in description. To-day every London shopboy knows\r\nwhat this wilderness of coarse green or brown grasses is like; he can\r\npicture the dry streams, the jagged kopjes, the glare of summer, and\r\nthe bitter winter cold. It has entered into patriotic jingles, and has\r\ngiven a _mise-en-scene_ to crude melodrama. And yet no natural feature\r\nwas ever so hard to fully realise. One cannot think of a monotonous\r\nvastness, like the prairie, for it is everywhere broken up and varied.\r\nIt is too great for an easy appreciation, as of an English landscape,\r\ntoo subtle and diverse for rhetorical generalities--a thing essentially\r\nmysterious and individual. In consequence it has a charm which the\r\ncommon efforts of mother-earth after grandiloquence can never possess.\r\nThere is something homely and kindly and soothing in it, something\r\nessentially humane and fitted to the needs of human life. Climb to the\r\ntop of the nearest ridge, and after a broad green valley there will be\r\nanother ridge just the same: cross the mountains fifty miles off, and\r\nthe country will repeat itself as before. But this sameness in outline\r\nis combined with an infinite variety in detail, so that we readily take\r\nback our first complaint of monotony, and wonder at the intricate\r\nnovelty of each vista.\r\n\r\nHere the veld is simply the broad green side of a hill, with blue\r\npoints of mountain peeping over the crest, and a ragged brown road\r\nscarred across it. The road is as hard as adamant, a stiff red clay\r\nbaked by the sun into porphyry, with fissures yawning here and there,\r\nso deep that often it is hard to see the gravel at the bottom. A\r\ncheerful country to drive in on a dark night in a light English cart,\r\nbut less deadly to the lumbering waggons of the farmer. We choose the\r\ngrass to ride on, which grows in coarse clumps with bare soil between.\r\nHere, too, are traps for the loose rider. A conical ant-heap with odd\r\nperforations, an ant-bear hole three feet down, or, most insidious of\r\nall, a meerkat's hole hidden behind a tuft of herbage. A good pony can\r\ngallop and yet steer, provided the rider trusts it; but the best will\r\nmake mistakes, and on occasion roll over like a rabbit. Most men begin\r\nwith a dreary apprenticeship to spills; but it is curious how few are\r\nhurt, despite the hardness of the ground. One soon learns the art of\r\nfalling clear and falling softly.\r\n\r\nThe four o'clock December sun blazes down on us, raising hot odours\r\nfrom the grass. A grey African hare starts from its form, a meerkat\r\nslips away indignantly, a widow-bird, coy and ridiculous like a\r\nflirtatious widow, flops on ahead. The sleepy, long-horned Afrikander\r\ncattle raise listless eyes as we pass, and a few gaudy butterflies\r\nwaver athwart us. Otherwise there is no sound or sight of life.\r\nFlowers of rich colours--chrysanthemums, gentians, geraniums--most of\r\nthem variants of familiar European species, grow in clumps so lowly\r\nthat one can only observe them by looking directly from above. It is\r\nthis which makes the veld so colourless to a stranger. There are no\r\ngowans or buttercups or heather, to blazon it like a spring meadow or\r\nan August moorland. Five yards off, and nothing is visible but the\r\ngreen stalks of grass or a red boulder.\r\n\r\nAt the summit of the ridge there is a breeze and a far prospect. The\r\nroad still runs on up hill and down dale, through the distant\r\nmountains, and on to the great pastoral uplands of Rustenburg and the\r\nfar north-west. On either side the same waving grass, now grey and now\r\ngreen as the wind breathes over it. Below is a glen with a gleam of\r\nwater, and some yards of tender lawn on either bank. Farmhouses line\r\nthe sides, each with its dam, its few acres of untidy crop land, and\r\nits bower of trees. Beyond rise line upon line of green ridges, with a\r\nglimpse of woods and dwellings set far apart, till in the far distance\r\nthe bold spurs of the Magaliesberg stand out against the sky. A thin\r\ntrail of smoke from some veld-fire hangs between us and the mountains,\r\ntempering the intense clearness of an African prospect. There is\r\nsomething extraordinarily delicate and remote about the vista; it\r\nmight be a mirage, did not the map bear witness to its reality. It is\r\nnot unlike a child's conception of the landscape of Bunyan, a road\r\nrunning straight through a mystical green country, with the hilltops\r\nof the Delectable Mountains to cheer the pilgrim. And indeed the land\r\nis instinct with romance. The names of the gorges which break the\r\nmountain line--Olifants' Poort, Crocodile Poort, Commando Nek--speak\r\nof war and adventure and the far tropics beyond these pastoral\r\nvalleys. The little farms are all \"Rests\" and \"Fountains,\" the true\r\nnomenclature of a far-wandering, home-loving people. The slender\r\nrivulet below us is one of the topmost branches of the great Limpopo,\r\nrising in a marsh in the wood behind, forcing its way through the\r\nhills and the bush-veld to the north, and travelling thence through\r\njungles and fever-swamps to the Portuguese sea-coast. The road is one\r\nof the old highways of exploration; it is not fifty years since a\r\nwhite man first saw the place. And yet it is as pastoral as Yarrow or\r\nExmoor; it has the green simplicity of sheep-walks and the homeliness\r\nof a long-settled rustic land. In the afternoon peace there is no hint\r\nof the foreign or the garish; it is as remote as Holland itself from\r\nthe unwholesome splendours of the East and South.\r\n\r\nNo landscape is so masterful as the veld. Broken up into valleys,\r\nreclaimed in parts by man, showing fifty varieties of scene, it yet\r\npreserves one essential character. For, homely as it is, it is\r\nlikewise untamable. There are no fierce encroachments about it. A\r\ndeserted garden does not return to the veld for many years, if ever.\r\nIt is not, like the jungle, the natural enemy of man, waiting for a\r\nchance to enter and obliterate his handiwork, and repelled only by\r\nsleepless watching. Rather it is the quiet spectator of human efforts,\r\nready to meet them half-way, and yet from its vastness always the\r\ndominant feature in any landscape. Its normal air is sad, grey, and\r\nQuakerish, never flamboyant under the brightest sun, and yet both\r\nstrenuous and restful. The few red monstrosities man has built on its\r\nedge serve only to set off this essential dignity. For one thing, it\r\nis not created according to the scale of man. It will give him a home,\r\nbut he will never alter its aspect. Let him plough and reap it for a\r\nthousand years, and he may beautify and fructify but never change it.\r\nThe face of England has altered materially in two centuries, because\r\nEngland is on a human scale,--a parterre land, without intrinsic\r\nwildness. But cultivation on the veld will always be superimposed: it\r\nwill remain, like Egypt, ageless and immutable--one of the primeval\r\ntypes of the created world.\r\n\r\nBut, though dominant, it is also adaptable. It can, for the moment,\r\nassume against its unchangeable background a chameleon-like variety.\r\nSky and weather combine to make it imitative at times. Now, under a\r\npale Italian sky, it is the Campagna--hot, airless, profoundly\r\nmelancholy. Again, when the mist drives over it, and wet scarps of\r\nhill stand out among clouds, it is Dartmoor or Liddesdale; or on a\r\nradiant evening, when the mountains are one bank of hazy purple, it\r\nhas borrowed from Skye and the far West Highlands. On a clear steely\r\nmorning it has the air of its namesake, the Norwegian fjelds,--in one\r\nway the closest of its parallels. But each phase passes, the\r\ntantalising memory goes, and we are back again upon the aboriginal\r\nveld, so individual that we wonder whence arose the illusion.\r\n\r\nA modern is badly trained for appreciating certain kinds of scenery.\r\nGenerations of poets and essayists have so stamped the \"pathetic\r\nfallacy\" upon his soul that wherever he goes, unless in the presence\r\nof a Niagara or a Mount Everest, he runs wild, looking for a human\r\ninterest or a historical memory. This is well enough in the old\r\nsettled lands, but on the veld it is curiously inept. The man who, in\r\nEmerson's phrase, seeks \"to impress his English whim upon the\r\nimmutable past,\" will find little reward for his gymnastics. Not that\r\nthere is no history of a kind--of Bantu wars, and great tribal\r\nimmigrations, of wandering gold-seekers and Portuguese adventurers,\r\nof the voortrekker and the heroic battles in the wilds. But the veld\r\nis so little subject to human life that had Thermopylae been fought in\r\nyonder nek, or had Saint Francis wandered on this hillside, it would\r\nhave mastered and obliterated the memories. It has its history; but it\r\nis the history of cosmic forces, of the cycle of seasons, of storms\r\nand suns and floods, the joys and sorrows of the natural world.\r\n\r\n   \"Lo, for there among the flowers and grasses\r\n    Only the mightier movement sounds and passes;\r\n             Only winds and rivers,\r\n             Life and death.\"\r\n\r\nMen dreamed of it and its wealth long ago in Portugal and Holland.\r\nThey have quarrelled about it in London and Cape Town, fought for it,\r\nparcelled it out in maps, bought it and sold it. It has been subject\r\nfor long to the lusts and hopes of man. It has been larded with\r\nepithets; town-bred folk have made theories about it; armies have\r\nrumbled across it; the flood of high politics has swept it. But the\r\nveld has no memory of it. Men go and come, kingdoms fall and rise, but\r\nit remains austere, secluded, impenetrable, \"the still unravished\r\nbride of quietness.\"\r\n\r\nAs one lives with it the thought arises, May not some future\r\ncivilisation grow up here in keeping with the grave country? The basis\r\nof every civilisation is wealth--wealth to provide the background of\r\nleisure, which in turn is the basis of culture in a commercial world.\r\nOur colonial settlements have hitherto been fortuitous. They have\r\nfought a hard fight for a livelihood, and in the process missed the\r\nfiner formative influences of the land. When, then, civilisation came\r\nit was naturally a borrowed one--English with an accent. But here, as\r\nin the old Greek colonies, we begin _de novo_, and at a certain high\r\nplane of life. The Dutch, our forerunners, acquired the stamp of the\r\nsoil, but they lived on the barest scale of existence, and were without\r\nthe aptitude or the wealth to go farther. Our situation is different.\r\nWe start rich, and with a prospect of growing richer. On one side are\r\nthe mining centres--cosmopolitan, money-making, living at a strained\r\npitch; on the other this silent country. The time will come when the\r\nrich man will leave the towns, and, as most of them are educated and\r\nall are able men, he will create for himself a leisured country life.\r\nHis sons in turn will grow up with something autochthonous in their\r\nnature. For those who are truly South Africans at heart, and do not\r\nhurry to Europe to spend their wealth, there is a future, we may\r\nbelieve, of another kind than they contemplate. All great institutions\r\nare rooted and grounded in the soil. There is an art, a literature, a\r\nschool of thought implicit here for the understanding heart,--no\r\ntarnished European importation, but the natural, spontaneous fruit of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nAs we descend into the glen the going underfoot grows softer, the\r\nflinty red clay changes to sand and soon to an irregular kind of turf.\r\nAt last we are on the stream-bank, and the waving grasses have gone.\r\nInstead there is the true meadow growth, reeds and water-plants and a\r\nspecies of gorgeous scarlet buck-bean; little runnels from the\r\nfarm-dams creep among the rushes, and soon our horses' feet are\r\nsquelching through a veritable bog. Here are the sights and sounds of\r\na Hampshire water-meadow. Swallows skim over the pools; dragon-flies\r\nand bees brush past; one almost expects to see a great trout raise a\r\nsleepy head from yonder shining reach. But there are no trout, alas!\r\nnone, I fear, nearer than Natal; only a small greenish barbel who is a\r\ngiant at four to the pound. The angler will get small satisfaction\r\nhere, though on the Mooi River, above Potchefstroom, I have heard\r\nstories of a golden-scaled monster who will rise to a sea-trout fly.\r\nAs we jump the little mill-lades, a perfect host of frogs are leaping\r\nin the grass, and small bright-eyed lizards slip off the stones at our\r\napproach. But, though the glen is quick with life, there is no sound:\r\na deep Sabbatical calm broods over all things. The cry of a Kaffir\r\ndriver from the highroad we have left breaks with an almost startling\r\nviolence on the quiet. The tall reeds hush the stream's flow, the\r\nbirds seem songless, even the hum of insects is curiously dim. There\r\nis nothing for the ear, but much for the eye and more for the nostril.\r\nOur ride has been through a treasure-house of sweet scents. First the\r\npines and gum-trees; then the drowsy sweetness of the sunburnt veld;\r\nand now the more delicate flavour of rich soil and water and the\r\nsun-distilled essences of a thousand herbs. What the old Greek wrote\r\nof Arabia the Blessed might fitly be written here, \"From this country\r\nthere is a smell wondrous sweet.\"\r\n\r\nLower down the glen narrows. The stream would be a torrent if there\r\nwere more water; but the cascades are a mere trickle, and only the\r\ndeep green rock-pools, the banks of shingle, and the worn foot of the\r\ncliff, show what this thread can grow to in the rains. A light wild\r\nbrushwood begins, and creeps down to the very edge of the stream.\r\nTwenty years ago lions roamed in this scrub; now we see nothing but\r\ntwo poaching pariah dogs. We pass many little one-storeyed farms, each\r\nwith a flower-garden run to seed, and some acres of tangled crops.\r\nAll are deserted. War has been here with its heavy hand, and a broken\r\nstoep, empty windows, and a tumbled-in roof are the marks of its\r\npassage. The owners may be anywhere--still on commando with Delarey,\r\nin Bermuda or Ceylon, in Europe, in camps of refuge, on parole in the\r\ntowns. Great sunflowers, a foot in diameter, sprawl over the railings,\r\ndahlias and marigolds nod in the evening sunshine, and broken\r\nfruit-trees lean over the walks. Suddenly from the yard a huge\r\naasvogel flaps out--the bird not of war but of unclean pillage. There\r\nis nothing royal in the creature, only obscene ferocity and a furtive\r\ngreed. But its presence, as it rises high into the air, joined with\r\nthe fallen rooftrees, effectively drives out Arcady from the scene. We\r\nfeel we are in a shattered country. This quiet glen, which in peace\r\nmight be a watered garden, becomes suddenly a desert. The veld is\r\nsilent, but such secret nooks will blab their tale shamelessly to the\r\npasser-by.\r\n\r\nThe stream bends northward in a more open valley, and as we climb the\r\nridge we catch sight of the country beyond and the same august lines\r\nof mountain. But now there is a new feature in the landscape. Bushes\r\nare dotted over the far slope, and on the brow cluster together into\r\nsomething like a coppice. It is a patch of bush-veld, as rare on our\r\nhigh-veld as are fragments of the old Ettrick forest in Tweeddale. Two\r\nhundred miles north is the real bush-veld, full of game and fevers,\r\nthe barrier between the tropical Limpopo and these grassy uplands.\r\nSeen in the splendour of evening there is a curious savagery about\r\nthat little patch, which is neither veld nor woodland, but something\r\ndwarfish and uncanny. That is Africa, the Africa of travellers; but\r\nthus far we have ridden through a countryside so homely and familiar\r\nthat we are not prepared for a foreign intrusion. Which leads us to\r\nour hope of a new civilisation. If it ever comes, what an outlook it\r\nwill have into the wilds! In England we look to the sea, in France\r\nacross a frontier, even in Russia there is a mountain barrier between\r\nEast and West. But here civilisation will march sharply with\r\nbarbarism, like a castle of the Pale, looking over a river to a land\r\nof mists and outlaws. A man would have but to walk northward, out of\r\nthe cities and clubs and the whole world of books and talk, to reach\r\nthe country of the oldest earth-dwellers, the untamable heart of the\r\ncontinent. It is much for a civilisation to have its background--the\r\nEgyptian against the Ethiopian, Greek against Thracian, Rome against\r\nGaul. It is also much for a race to have an outlook, a far horizon to\r\nwhich its fancy can turn. Even so strong men are knit and art is\r\npreserved from domesticity.\r\n\r\nWe turn homeward over the long shoulders of hill, keeping to the track\r\nin the failing light. If the place is sober by day, it is transformed\r\nin the evening. For an hour the land sinks out of account, and the sky\r\nis the sole feature. No words can tell the tale of a veld sunset. Not\r\nthe sun dipping behind the peaks of Jura, or flaming in the mouth of a\r\nNorwegian fiord, or sinking, a great ball of fire, in mid-Atlantic,\r\nhas the amazing pageantry of these upland evenings. A flood of crimson\r\ndescends on the world, rolling in tides from the flagrant west, and\r\nkindling bush and scaur and hill-top, till the land glows and pulsates\r\nin a riot of colour. And then slowly the splendour ebbs, lingering\r\nonly to the west in a shoreless, magical sea. A delicate pearl-grey\r\noverspreads the sky, and the onlooker thinks that the spectacle is\r\nended. It has but begun; for there succeed flushes of ineffable\r\ncolour,--purple, rose-pink, tints of no mortal name,--each melting\r\nimperceptibly into the other, and revealing again the twilight world\r\nwhich the earlier pageant had obscured. Every feature in the landscape\r\nstands out with a tender, amethystine clearness. The mountain-ridge is\r\ncut like a jewel against the sky; the track is a ribbon of pure beaten\r\ngold. And then the light fades, the air becomes a soft mulberry haze,\r\nthe first star pricks out in the blue, and night is come.\r\n\r\nHere is a virgin soil for art, if the art arises. In our modern\r\nhistory there is no true poetry of vastness and solitude. What there\r\nis is temperamental and introspective, not the simple interpretation\r\nof a natural fact. In the old world, indeed, there is no room for it:\r\na tortured, crowded land may produce the aptitude, but it cannot give\r\nthe experience. And the new lands have had no chance to realise their\r\nfreshness: when their need for literature arose, they have taken it\r\nsecond-hand. The Australian poet sings of the bush in the rococo\r\naccents of Fleet Street, and when he is natural he can tell of simple\r\nhuman emotions, but not of the wilds. For the chance of the seeing eye\r\nhas gone. He is not civilised but de-civilised, having borrowed the\r\nraiment of his elder brother. But, if South African conditions be as\r\nmen believe, here we have a different prospect. The man who takes this\r\ncountry as his own will take it at another level than the pioneer. The\r\nveld will be to him more than a hunting-ground, and the seasons may be\r\nviewed from another than a commercial standpoint. If the art arises,\r\nit will be an austere art--with none of the fatuities of the\r\npicturesque, bare of false romance and preciosities, but essentially\r\nlarge, simple, and true. It will be the chronicle of the veld, the\r\nsong of the cycle of Nature, the epic of life and death, and \"the\r\nunimaginable touch of time.\" Who can say that from this land some dew\r\nof freshness may not descend upon a jaded literature, and the world be\r\nthe richer by a new Wordsworth, a more humane Thoreau, or a manlier\r\nSenancour?\r\n\r\nOnce more we are in the wood, now a ghostly place with dark aisles and\r\nthe windless hush of evening in the branches. The flying ants are\r\ncoming out of the ground for their short life of a night. The place is\r\nalive with wings, moths and strange insects, that go white and\r\nglimmering in the dusk. The clear darkness that precedes moonrise is\r\nover the earth, so that everything stands out clear in a kind of\r\ndark-green monochrome. Something of an antique dignity, like an\r\nevening of Claude Lorraine, is stealing into the landscape. Once more\r\nthe veld is putting on an alien dress, till in this fairyland weather\r\nwe forget our continent again. And yet who shall limit Africa to one\r\naspect? Our whole ride has been a kaleidoscope of its many phases. Hot\r\nand sunburnt, dry grasses and little streams, the red rock and the\r\nfantastic sunset. And on the other side the quiet green valleys, the\r\nsoothing vista of blue hills, the cool woods, the water-meadows, and\r\nthe twilight. It is a land of contrasts--glimpses of desert and\r\nbarbarism, memories of war, relics of old turmoil, and yet essentially\r\na homeland. As the phrase goes, it is a \"white man's country\"; by\r\nwhich I understand a country not only capable of sustaining life, but\r\nfit for the amenities of life and the nursery of a nation. Whether it\r\nwill rise to a nation or sink to a territory rests only with its\r\npeople. But it is well to recognise its possibilities, to be in love\r\nwith the place, for only then may we have the hope which can front and\r\ntriumph over the many obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe first darkness is passing, a faint golden light creeps up the sky,\r\nand suddenly over a crest comes the African moon, bathing the warm\r\nearth in its cold pure radiance. This moon, at any rate, is the\r\npeculiar possession of the land. At home it is a disc, a ball of\r\nlight; but here it is a glowing world riding in the heavens, a\r\nveritable kingdom of fire. No virgin huntress could personify it, but\r\nrather some mighty warrior-god, driving his chariot among trampled\r\nstars. It lights us out of the wood, and on to the highroad, and then\r\namong the sunflowers and oleanders of the garden. The night air is\r\ncool and bracing, but soft as summer; and as we dismount our thoughts\r\nturn homeward, and we have a sudden regret. For in this month and at\r\nthis hour in that other country we should be faring very differently.\r\nNo dallying with zephyrs and sunsets; but the coming in, cold and\r\nweary, from the snowy hill, and telling over the peat-fire the\r\nunforgettable romance of winter sport.\r\n\r\n_December 1901._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIN THE TRACKS OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nWe left Klerksdorp in a dust-storm so thick and incessant that it was\r\ndifficult to tell where the houses ended and the open country began.\r\nThe little town, which may once have been a clean, smiling place, has\r\nbeen for months the _corpus vile_ of military operations. A dozen\r\ncolumns have made it their destination; the transport and supplies of\r\nthe whole Western Army have been congested there, with the result that\r\nthe town lands have been rubbed bare of grass, the streets furrowed\r\ninto dust-heaps, and the lightest breeze turned into a dust-tornado.\r\nOur Cape carts rattled over the bridge of the Schoon Spruit--\"Caller\r\nWater,\" as we might translate it in Scots, but here a low and muddy\r\ncurrent between high banks--and, climbing a steep hill past the old\r\ntown of Klerksdorp, came out of the fog into clearer veld, over which\r\na gale of wind was blowing strongly. The desert was strewn with empty\r\ntins, which caught the sun like quartz; stands of barbed wire were\r\neverywhere on the broad uneven highway; little dust devils spouted at\r\nintervals on to the horizon. The place was like nothing so much as a\r\nlarge deserted brick-field in some Midland suburb.\r\n\r\nThere is one feature of the high veld which has not had the attention\r\nit deserves--I mean the wind. Ask a man who has done three years'\r\ntrekking what he mostly complains of, and he will be silent about food\r\nand drink, the sun by day and the frost by night, but he is certain to\r\nbreak into picturesque language about the wind. The wind of winter\r\nblows not so unkindly as persistently. Day and night the cheek is\r\nflaming from its buffets. There is no shelter from scrub or kopje, for\r\nit is a most cunning wind, and will find a cranny to whistle through.\r\nLittle wrinkles appear round blinking eyes, the voice gets a high\r\npitch of protest, and a man begins to walk sideways like a crab to\r\npresent the smallest surface to his enemy. And with the wind go all\r\nmanner of tin-cans, trundling from one skyline to another with a most\r\npurposeful determination. Somewhere--S.S.W. I should put the\r\ndirection--there must be a Land of Tin-cans, where in some sheltered\r\nvalley all the _debris_ of the veld has come to anchor.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock the wind abated a little, and the road passed into a\r\ncountry of low hills with a scrub of mimosa thorn along the flats. The\r\nbustard, which the Boers have so aptly named \"korhaan\" or scolding\r\ncock, strutted by the roadside, a few hawks circled about us, and an\r\nincurious secretary-bird flapped across our path. The first water\r\nappeared,--a melancholy stream called Rhenoster Spruit,--and the\r\ncountry grew hillier and greener till we outspanned for lunch at a\r\nfarmhouse of some pretensions, with a large dam, a spruit, and a good\r\npatch of irrigated land. The owner had returned, and was dwelling in a\r\ntent against the restoration of his homestead. A considerable herd of\r\ncattle grazed promiscuously on the meadow, and the farmer with\r\nphilosophic calm was smoking his pipe in the shade. Apparently he was\r\na man of substance, and above manual toil; for though he had been back\r\nfor some time there was no sign of getting to work on repairs, such as\r\nwe saw in smaller holdings. Fairly considered, this repatriation is a\r\nhard nut for the proud, indolent Boer, for it means the reversal of a\r\nlife's order. His bywoners are scattered, his native boys refuse to\r\nreturn to him; there is nothing for the poor man to do but to take\r\npick and hammer himself. Sooner or later he will do it, for in the\r\nlast resort he is practical, but in the meantime he smokes and ponders\r\non the mysteries of Providence and the odd chances of life.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon our road lay through a pleasant undulating land, with\r\ngreen patches along the streams and tracts of bush relieving the\r\nmonotony of the grey winter veld. Every farmhouse we passed was in the\r\nsame condition,--roofless, windowless, dams broken, water-furrows\r\nchoked, and orchards devastated. Our way of making war may be effective\r\nas war, but it inflicts terrible wounds upon the land. After a campaign\r\nof a dozen bloody fights reconstruction is simple; the groundwork\r\nremains for a new edifice. But, though the mortality be relatively\r\nsmall, our late methods have come very near to destroying the\r\nfoundations of rural life. We have to build again from the beginning;\r\nwe have to face questions of simple existence which seem strange to us,\r\nwho in our complex society rarely catch sight of the bones of the\r\nsocial structure. To be sure there is hope. There is a wonderful\r\nrecuperative power in the soil; the Boer is simpler in habits than most\r\ncountrymen; and it is not a generation since he was starting at the\r\nsame rudiments. Further, our own settlers will have the same\r\nbeginnings, and there is a chance of rural communities, Boer and\r\nBritish, being more thoroughly welded together, because they can\r\nadvance _pari passu_ from the same starting-point. But to the new-comer\r\nthe situation has a baffling oddness. It seems strange to be doling out\r\nthe necessaries of life to a whole community, to be dealing with a\r\nsociety which must have been full of shades and divisions like all\r\nrural societies, as a featureless collection of units. Yet it is\r\nprobable that the Boers themselves are the last to realise it. The\r\npeople who crowded to the doors of the ruined farms as we passed\r\nwere on the whole good-humoured, patient, and uncomplaining. They\r\nhad set about repairing the breaches in their fortunes, crudely but\r\ncontentedly. At one farm we saw a curious Arcadian sight in this\r\ndesert which war had made. Some small Boer children were herding a\r\nflock of sheep along a stream. A little girl in a sunbonnet was\r\ncarrying a lamb; two brown, ragged, bare-legged boys were amusing\r\nthemselves with a penny whistle. To the children war and reconstruction\r\nalike can only have been a game; and hope and the future are to the\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nFrom Klerksdorp to Wolmaranstad the distance is some fifty miles, and\r\nit was almost nightfall before we descended with very weary cattle the\r\nlong hill to our outspan. The country was one wide bare wold, the sky\r\na soft glow of amber; and there was nothing between amber earth and\r\namber sky save one solitary korhaan, scolding in the stillness. I do\r\nnot know who the first Wolmarans may have been, but he built a stad\r\nvery like a little Border town--all huddled together and rising\r\nsuddenly out of the waste. The Makasi Spruit is merely a string of\r\nmuddied water-holes, but in the darkness it might have been the \"wan\r\nwater\" of Liddel or Yarrow. We camped in one of the few rooms that\r\nhad still a roof, and rid ourselves of the dust of the road in an old\r\nouthouse in the company of a facetious monkey and a saturnine young\r\neagle. When we had warmed ourselves and dined, I began to like\r\nWolmaranstad, and, after a moonlight walk, I came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was a most picturesque and charming town. But Wolmaranstad,\r\nlike Melrose, should be seen by moonlight; for in the morning it\r\nlooked little more than a collection of ugly shanties jumbled together\r\nin a dusty patch of veld.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August, in the usual dust-storm, we started for\r\nLichtenburg. There is no highroad, but a series of wild cross-country\r\npaths merging constantly in farm-roads. No map is quite reliable, and\r\nlocal information is fallacious. The day being the festival of St\r\nGrouse, we shot conscientiously all morning with very poor success.\r\nThe game was chiefly korhaan, and he is a hard bird to get on terms\r\nwith. About the size of a blackcock, and as slow on the wing, he looks\r\nan easy mark; but if stalked, he has a habit of rising just out of\r\nrange, and repeating the performance till he has lured you a mile from\r\nyour waggon, when he squawks in triumph and departs into the void. The\r\northodox way is to ride round him in slowly narrowing circles--a ruse\r\nwhich seems to baffle his otherwise alert intelligence. The country\r\nwas rolling veld dotted with wait-a-bit thorn-bushes; the farmhouses\r\nfew but large; the roads heavy with sand. In one hill-top farm, well\r\nnamed Uitkyk, we found an old farmer and his son-in-law, who invited\r\nus to enter. The place was in fair order, being out of the track of\r\ncolumns, tolerably furnished, and with the usual portrait of the\r\nReverend Andrew Murray on the wall. The farmer had no complaints to\r\nmake, being well-to-do and too old to worry about earthly things; but\r\nthe son-in-law, a carpenter by trade, was full of his grievances. The\r\nneighbourhood, being in ruins, was crying for his services, he said,\r\nbut there was no material in the country to work with. Building\r\nmaterial was scarce in Johannesburg and Pretoria; how much scarcer it\r\nmust be in Wolmaranstad! This just complaint was frequent on our\r\njourney; for the Transvaal, served by its narrow-gauge single-line\r\nrailways choked with military traffic, is badly equipped with the\r\nnecessaries of reconstruction, and many willing workmen have to kick\r\ntheir heels in idleness.\r\n\r\nWe outspanned at midday near some pools of indifferent water, which our\r\nauthorities had enthusiastically described as an abundant water-supply.\r\nThere was a roofless farm close by, where a kind of hut of biscuit-tins\r\nhad been erected, in which a taciturn young woman was nursing a child.\r\nThere was also a boy of about sixteen in the place who had coffee with\r\nus, and took us afterwards to stalk korhaan with a rifle. He was newly\r\nhome from commando, full of spirit and good-humour, and handled\r\nlongingly the rifle which the law forbade him to possess. All afternoon\r\nwe passed roofless farmhouses crowded with women and children, and in\r\nmost cases the farmer was getting forward in the work of restoration.\r\nDams and water-furrows were being mended, some kind of roof put on the\r\nhouse, waggons cobbled together, and in many cases a good deal of\r\nploughing had been done. The country grew bleaker as we advanced,\r\ntrees disappeared, huge wind-swept downs fell away on each side of the\r\npath, and heavy rain-clouds came up from the west. The real rains begin\r\nin October, but chill showers often make their appearance in August,\r\nand I know nothing more desolate than the veld in such a storm.\r\nBy-and-by we struck the path of a column, ploughed up by heavy\r\ngun-carriages, and in following the track somehow missed our proper\r\nroad. The darkness came while we were yet far from our outspan,\r\ncrawling up a great hill, which seemed endless. At the top a fine sight\r\nawaited us, for the whole country in front seemed on fire. A low line\r\nof hills was tipped with flame, and the racing fires were sweeping into\r\nthe flats with the solid regularity of battalions. A moment before, and\r\nwe had been in Shelley's\r\n\r\n    \"Wide, grey, lampless, deep, unpeopled world\";\r\n\r\nnow we were in the midst of light and colour and elfish merriment. To\r\nme there is nothing solemn in a veld-fire--nothing but madness and\r\nfantasy. The veld, so full at other times of its own sadness, the\r\n\r\n    \"Acerbo indegno mistero della cose,\"\r\n\r\nbecomes demented, and cries an impish defiance to the austere kings\r\nwho sit in Orion. The sight raised our spirits, and we stumbled down\r\nthe long hillside in a better temper. By-and-by a house of a sort\r\nappeared in the valley bottom, and a dog's bark told us that it was\r\ninhabited. To our relief we found that we had actually struck our\r\noutspan, Korannafontein, having approached it from the opposite side.\r\nThe Koranna have long since gone from it, and the sole inhabitant was\r\na Jew storekeeper, a friendly person, who assisted us to doctor our\r\nvery weary horses. The ways of the Jew are past all finding out.\r\nRefuse to grant him a permit for himself and goods, and he says\r\nnothing; but he is in occupation months before the Gentile, unless\r\nthat Gentile comes from Aberdeen. Our friend had his store stocked,\r\nand where he got the transport no man knows. He spoke well of the\r\nneighbourhood, both of Boer and native. The natives here, he said, are\r\ncivilised. I asked him his definition of civilisation. \"They speak\r\nDutch,\" he said,--an answer worth recording. We camped for the night\r\nbehind what had once been the wool-shed. The floor of the tent was\r\ndirty, and, foolishly, I sent a boy to \"mak skoon.\" He made \"skoon\" by\r\ndigging up dust with a shovel and storing it in heaps in different\r\ncorners. About midnight the rain fell heavily, and a little later a\r\ngreat wind rose and put those dust-heaps in circulation. I awoke from\r\ndreams of salmon-fishing with a profound conviction that I had been\r\nburied under a landslip. I crawled hastily through a flap followed by\r\na stream of dust, and no ventilation could make that tent habitable,\r\nso that in the morning we awoke with faces like colliers, and throats\r\nas dry as the nether millstone.\r\n\r\nFrom Korannafontein to Lichtenburg is something over forty miles, so\r\nwe started at daybreak and breakfasted at a place called Rhenosterput,\r\nwhere some gentleman sent a Mauser bullet over our heads to remind us\r\nof his presence. The country was downland, very full of Namaqua\r\npartridge and the graceful spur-winged plover, a ranching country, for\r\nthe streams had little fall and less water. At midday we outspanned at\r\na pretty native village called Rooijantjesfontein, with a large church\r\nafter the English village pattern, and a big dam lined with poplars.\r\nThe life of a commercial missionary, who bought a farm when land was\r\ncheap and had it cultivated by his congregation, is a pleasant one:\r\nhe makes a large profit, spends easy days, and returns early to his\r\nnative Germany. It is a type I have little patience with, for it\r\ndiscredits one of the most heroic of human callings, and turns loose\r\non society the slim Christian native, who brings Christianity and\r\ncivilisation alike into discredit. We were now out of the region of\r\ntracks and on the main road to Lichtenburg, and all afternoon we\r\ntravelled across the broad shallow basin of the Hartz River with our\r\ngoal full in view on a distant hill-top. Far off on our right we saw a\r\ncurious sight--a funeral waggon with a train of mourners creeping\r\nslowly across the veld. The Boers, as we heard from many sources, are\r\nexhuming the dead from different battle-fields, and bringing them,\r\noften from great distances, to the graveyards on their own homesteads.\r\nAn odd sombre task, not without its grandeur; for to the veld farmer,\r\nas to the old Roman, there are Lares and Penates, and he wishes at the\r\nlast to gather all his folk around him.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nLichtenburg, as I have said, stands on a hill-top, but when one enters\r\nhe finds a perfect model of a Dutch village. The streets are lined with\r\nwillows and poplars, and seamed with water-furrows, and all the\r\nprincipal buildings surround a broad village green on which cattle were\r\ngrazing. Seen in the morning it lost nothing of its attractiveness; and\r\nit dwells in my memory as a fresh clean place, looking over a wide\r\nupland country,--a place where men might lead honest lives, and meet\r\nthe world fearlessly. It has its own relics of war. The court-house\r\nroof and walls are splashed with bullets, relics of Delarey's fight\r\nwith the Northumberland Fusileers. General Delarey is himself the\r\nprincipal inhabitant. He owns much land in the neighbourhood, and his\r\nhouse stands a few miles out on the Mafeking road. From this district\r\nwas drawn all that was most chivalrous and resolute in the Boer forces;\r\nand the name of their leader is still a synonym with lovers of good\r\nfighting men for the finest quality of his race.\r\n\r\nThe Zeerust road is as bad going for waggons as I have ever seen. It\r\nruns for miles through a desert where the soil is as black as in\r\nLancashire, and a kind of coaly dust rises in everlasting clouds. We\r\nstarted late in the day, so that sunset found us some distance from\r\nwater, in a featureless country. We were to outspan at the famous\r\nMalmani Oog--the eye of the Malmani; but a fountainhead is not a good\r\ngoal on a dark night to ignorant travellers. Shortly after dusk we\r\nrode on ahead to look for the stream. Low slopes of hills rose on all\r\nsides, but nowhere could we see a gleam or a hollow which might be\r\nwater. The distance may have been short, but to a hungry and thirsty\r\nman it seemed endless, as one hill after another was topped without\r\nany result. We found a fork in the road, and took the turn to the left\r\nas being more our idea of the way. As it happened we were trekking\r\nstraight for the Kalahari Desert, and but for the lucky sound of a\r\nwaggon on the other road might have been floundering there to-day. We\r\nturned aside to ask for information, and found we were all but at the\r\nOog, which lay in the trees a hundred yards off. The owner of the\r\nwaggon was returning to Lichtenburg with a sick wife, whom he had\r\ntaken to Zeerust for a change. He had been a road surveyor under the\r\nlate Government, had served on Delarey's staff, and had been taken\r\nprisoner. A quiet reserved man with dignified manners, he answered our\r\nquestions without complaint or petulance. There is something noble in\r\ntravel when pursued in this stately leisure. The great buck-waggon,\r\nthe sixteen solemn oxen lumbering on, the master walking behind in the\r\nmoonlight, have an air of patriarchal dignity, an elder simplicity. I\r\nsuppose fifteen to twenty miles might be a good day's march, but who\r\nshall measure value by miles? It is the life for dreams, for roadside\r\nfires, nights under the stars, new faces studied at leisure, good\r\ncountry talk, and the long thoughts of an unharassed soul. Let us by\r\nall means be up and doing, setting the world to rights and sounding\r\nour own trumpet; but is the most successful wholly at ease in the\r\npresence of great mountains and forests, or men whose lives share in\r\nthe calm cycle of nature?\r\n\r\nThe night in tents was bitterly cold, and the morning bath, taken\r\nbefore sunrise in the springs of Malmani, was the most Arctic\r\nexperience I have ever met. We left our drivers to inspan and follow,\r\nand set off down the little stream with our guns. There are hours\r\nwhich live for ever in the memory--hours of intense physical\r\nexhilaration, the pure wine of health and youth, when the mind has no\r\nthoughts save for the loveliness of earth, and the winds of morning\r\nstir the blood to a heavenly fervour. No man who has experienced such\r\nseasons can be other than an optimist. Dull nights in cities,\r\nheartless labours with pen and ink, the squalid worries of business\r\nand ambition, all are forgotten, and in the retrospect it is those\r\nhours which stand up like shining hill-tops--the type of the pure\r\nworld before our sad mortality had laid its spell upon it. It is not\r\npleasure--the word is too debased in human parlance; nor happiness,\r\nfor that is for calm delights. Call it joy, that \"enthusiasm\" which is\r\nnow the perquisite of creeds and factions, but which of old belonged\r\nto the fauns and nymphs who followed Pan's piping in the woody hollows\r\nof Thessaly. I have known and loved many streams, but the little\r\nMalmani has a high place in my affections. The crystal water flowed\r\nout of great reed-beds into a shallow vale, where it wound in pools\r\nand cataracts to a broad ford below a ruined mill. Thence it passed\r\nagain into reed-beds fringed with willows and departed from our ken.\r\nThere was a bamboo covert opposite full of small singing birds; the\r\ncries of snipe and plover rose from the reed-beds, and the fall of\r\nwater, rarest of South African sounds, tinkled like steel in the cold\r\nmorning air. We shot nothing, for we saw nothing; the glory of the\r\nscene was all that mortal eye could hold at once. And then our waggons\r\nsplashed through the ford, and we had perforce to leave it.\r\n\r\nWe took a hill road, avoiding the detour by Malmani Drift, and after\r\nsome hours in a country of wooded glens, came into the broad valley of\r\nthe Klein Marico. The high veld and its scenery had been left far\r\nbehind. Something half tropical, even in this mid-winter, was in the\r\nair of those rich lowlands. After the bleak uplands of Lichtenburg it\r\nwas pleasant to see good timber, the green of winter crops, and\r\nabundant runnels of water. The farm-houses were larger and in fair\r\nrepair,--embowered, too, in orange-groves, with the golden fruit\r\nbright among the glossy leaves. Blossom was appearing in every\r\norchard; new and strange birds took the place of our enemy the\r\nkorhaan; and for the first time on our journey we saw buck on the\r\nslopes. The vale was ringed with stony tree-clad hills like the\r\nRiviera, and in the hot windless noon the dust hung in clouds about\r\nus, so that, in spite of water and greenery, my impression of that\r\nvalley is one of thirst and discomfort. Zeerust[11] is a pretty\r\nvillage close under the hills, with tree-lined streets,--a prosperous\r\nsleepy place, with no marks of the ravages of war. The farmers, too,\r\nare a different stock from the high-veld Boers; they get their living\r\nmore easily, and in their swarthy faces and slouching walk one cannot\r\nread the hard-bitten spirit which inspired the men of Botha and\r\nDelarey. They seemed on good terms with their new masters. We attended\r\na gymkhana given by the South African Constabulary, and the Dutch\r\nelement easily predominated in the crowd which watched the races. A\r\ngood-humoured element, too, for the men smoked and criticised the\r\nperformances in all friendliness, while their womenkind in their\r\nSunday clothes thronged to the marquees for tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [11]  Zeerust is a type of the curious truncated Boer\r\n        nomenclature, being a corruption of Coetzee's Rust.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe Rustenburg road runs due east through a fine defile called Klein\r\nMarico Poort, and thence in a country of thick bush for twenty miles\r\nto the ford of the Groot Marico. We started before dawn, and did not\r\nhalt for breakfast till the said ford, by which time the sun was high\r\nin the heavens and we were very hot, dusty, and hungry. Lofty wooded\r\nhills rose to the north, and not forty miles off lay the true\r\nhunting-veld, with koodoo, water-buck, and hippopotamus. Bird life was\r\nrich along the road--blue jays, rollers, and the handsome malicious\r\ngame-bird which acts as scout to the guinea-fowl, and with his harsh\r\ncall informs them of human presence. The farms were small and richly\r\nwatered, with laden orange-groves and wide ruined verandahs. The\r\npeople of Zeerust had spoken with tears in their eyes of the beautiful\r\ncondition of this road, but we found it by far the worst in our\r\ntravels. It lay deep in sand, was strewn with ugly boulders, and at\r\none ford was so impossible that we had to make a long detour over\r\nvirgin veld. The Great Marico, which, like all streams in the northern\r\nwatershed, joins the Limpopo, and indeed forms its chief feeder, is a\r\nmuddy tropical water, very unlike the clear Malmani. Beyond it the\r\ncountry becomes bare and pastoral again, full of little farms, to\r\nwhich the bulk of the inhabitants had returned. It was the most\r\nsmiling country we had seen, for bush-veld has an ineradicable air of\r\nbarbarism, but a green open land with white homesteads among trees is\r\nthe true type of a settled country. Apricot blossom lay like a soft\r\nhaze on the landscape. The young grass was already springing in the\r\nsheltered places, the cold dusty winds had gone, and a forehint of\r\nspring was in the calm evening.\r\n\r\nWe spent the night above the Elands River, a very beautiful full\r\nwater, almost on the site of the battle. The Elands River fight seems\r\nto have slipped from the memory of a people who made much of lesser\r\nperformances; but to soldiers it is easily the Thermopylae of the war.\r\nFive hundred or so of Australians of different regiments, with a few\r\nRhodesians, were marching to join another force, when they were cut\r\noff at Elands River by 3000 Boers. They were invited to surrender, and\r\ndeclined. A small number took up a position beside the stream; the\r\nremainder held a little ridge in the centre of the amphitheatre of\r\nhills. For several days they toiled at dug-outs--terrible days, for\r\nthey were shelled continually from the whole rim of the amphitheatre.\r\nOne relieving force from the west retired in despair; a relieving\r\nforce from the east was deceived by false heliograms, and went away,\r\nbelieving the work accomplished. Then came the report that they had\r\nsurrendered; and then, after some fifteen days, they were found by\r\nLord Kitchener, still holding the forlorn post. It was a mere\r\nsideshow, but to have been there was worth half the clasps in the\r\ncampaign. More shells were fired into that little place than into\r\nMafeking, and the courage of the few by the river who passed up water\r\nin the night to their comrades is beyond praise. The Colonials will\r\nlong remember Elands River. It was their own show: without generalship\r\nor orders, against all the easy traditions of civilised warfare, the\r\nsmall band followed the Berserker maxim, and vindicated the ancient\r\ndignity of arms. In the morning we went over the place. The dug-outs\r\nwere still mostly intact, and in a little graveyard beneath rude\r\ncrosses slept the heroic dead.\r\n\r\nA few miles farther on and the summit of a ridge was reached, from\r\nwhich the eye looked over a level valley to the superb western line of\r\nthe Magaliesberg. Straight in front was the cleft of Magata's Nek,\r\nbeyond which Rustenburg lay. The western Magaliesberg disappoints on\r\ncloser acquaintance. The cliffs prove to be mere loose kranzes, the\r\nglens are waterless, the woods are nothing but barren thorn. But seen\r\nfrom afar in the clear air of dawn, when the darkness is still lurking\r\nin the hollows and the blue peaks are flushed with sunrise, it is a\r\nfairyland picture, a true mountain barrier to an enchanted land. Our\r\nroad swung down a long slope to the Coster River, where we outspanned,\r\nand then through a sandy wilderness to the drift of the Selons. From\r\nthis it climbed wearily up to the throat of the nek, a dull tract of\r\ncountry with few farms and no beauties. The nek, too, on closer view\r\nhas little to commend it, save the prospect that opens on the other\r\nside. The level green plateau of Rustenburg lay before us, bounded on\r\nthe north by a chain of kopjes, and on the south by the long dark\r\nflanks of the Magaliesberg as it sweeps round to the east. A few miles\r\nand the village itself came in sight, with a great church, as at\r\nWakkerstroom, standing up like some simple rural cathedral over the\r\nlittle houses. Rustenburg was always the stronghold of the straitest\r\nsect of the Boers; and in the midst of the half-tropical country\r\naround, this sweep of pasture, crowned with a white kirk, had\r\nsomething austere and Puritan in its air,--the abode of a people with\r\ntheir own firm traditions, hostile and masterful towards the world.\r\nThe voortrekker having fought his way through the Magaliesberg passes,\r\noutspanned his tired oxen on this pleasant upland, and called it his\r\n\"city of rest.\" And it still looks its name, for no orchards and\r\ngardens can make it otherwise than a novelty in the landscape--sober,\r\nhomely, and comforting, like some Old Testament Elam where there were\r\ntwelve wells of water and three-score and ten palm-trees, or the\r\n\"plain called Ease\" wherein Christian \"walked with much content.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nWe took up our quarters at a farm a little way south of the town in\r\nthe very shadow of the mountains. It was a long, low, rambling house\r\ncalled Boschdaal, with thick walls and cool passages. All around were\r\nnoble gum-trees; a clear stream ran through the garden, which even at\r\nthis season was gay with tropical flowers; and the orchard was heavy\r\nwith oranges, lemons, and bananas. A little conical hill behind had a\r\npath made to its summit, whence one had a wide prospect of the\r\nMagaliesberg and the whole plateau. There were sheer cliffs in the\r\nbackground, with a waterfall among them; and between them and the\r\nhouse were some miles of park-like country where buck came in the\r\nmorning. The rooms were simply but pleasantly furnished; the walls a\r\nforest of horns; and the bookcases full of European classics, with a\r\ngreat abundance of German story-books for children, telling how wicked\r\nGretchen amended her ways, or little Hans saved his pennies.\r\nAltogether a charming dwelling-place, where a man might well spend his\r\ndays in worthy leisure, shooting, farming, gardening, and smoking his\r\npipe in the evening, with the sunset flaming over the hills.\r\n\r\nWe spent two nights in Rustenburg, visiting in the daytime a horse\r\ndepot to which a number of brood mares had been brought for winter\r\ngrazing, and paying our respects to a neighbouring chief, Magata, who\r\nlives in a _stad_ from which many town councils might learn a lesson\r\nof cleanliness and order. The natives are as rich as Jews from the\r\nwar, owning fine spans of oxen and Army Service Corps waggons, and\r\naltogether disinclined to stir themselves for wages. This prosperity\r\nof the lower race must be a bitter pill for the Boer to swallow, as he\r\ndrives in for his rations with a team of wretched donkeys, and sees\r\nhis former servants with buck-waggons and cattle. We watched strings\r\nof Burghers arriving at the depot, and at night several fires in the\r\nneighbouring fields told of their outspans. Most of them were polite\r\nand communicative: a very few did their business in sulky silence.\r\nThere was one man who took my fancy. Originally he must have been\r\nnearly seven feet high, but a wound in the back had bent him double.\r\nHe had long black hair, and sombre black eyes which looked straight\r\nbefore him into vacancy. He had a ramshackle home-made cart and eight\r\ndonkeys, and a gigantic whip, of which he was a consummate master. A\r\nsmall boy did his business for him, while he sat hunched up on his\r\ncart speaking hoarsely to his animals, and cracking his whip in the\r\nair,--a man for whom the foundations of the world had been upset, and\r\nhenceforth, like Cain, a dweller apart.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning we started regretfully, for Pretoria was only two\r\ndays distant. This was the pleasantest stage in our journey: the air was\r\ncool and fine, the roads good, water abundant, and a noble range of\r\nmountains kept us company. This is the tobacco-land of the Transvaal,\r\nwhence comes the Magaliesberg brand, which has a high reputation in\r\nSouth Africa. There are no big farms but a great number of small\r\nholdings, richly irrigated and populous--the stronghold of Mr Kruger in\r\nformer times, for he could always whistle his Rustenburgers to his will.\r\nNow and then a pass cleft the mountain line on our right, and in the\r\nafternoon we came in sight of the great gap through which the Crocodile\r\nRiver forces its passage. Farther east, and at a higher altitude, lay\r\nSilikat's Nek, which is called after Mosilikatse. It was approaching\r\nsunset as we crossed Commando Nek, which is divided from Crocodile Poort\r\nby a spur of mountain, and looked over the Witwatersberg rolling south\r\nto the Rand and the feverish life of cities. High up on a peak stood a\r\ncastellated blockhouse, looking like a peel tower in some old twilight\r\nof Northumbrian hills, and to the left and right the precipitous cliffs\r\nof the Magaliesberg ran out to the horizon. At the foot of the pass we\r\nforded the Magalies River, a stream of clear water running over a bed of\r\ngrey-blue stones, and in another half-hour we had crossed the bridge of\r\nthe Crocodile and outspanned on the farther bank.\r\n\r\nThe rivers unite a mile away, and the cleft of the Poort to which the\r\ntwin streams hurried stood out as black as ink in the moonlight. Far\r\nup on the hillside the bush was burning, and the glare made the gorge\r\nlike the gate of a mysterious world, guarded by flames and shadows.\r\nThis Poort is fine by daylight, but still not more than an ordinary\r\npass; but in the witching half-light it dominated the mind like a wild\r\ndream. After dinner we set out over the rough ground to where a cliff\r\nsank sheer from the moonlight into utter blackness. We heard the\r\ndifferent notes of the two rivers--the rapid Magalies and the sedater\r\nCrocodile; and then we came to the bank of the united stream, and\r\nscrambling along it found ourselves in the throat of the pass. High\r\nwalls of naked rock rose on either hand, and at last, after some hard\r\nwalking, we saw a space of clear star-sown sky and the land beyond the\r\nmountains. I had expected a brawling torrent; instead, I found a long\r\ndark lagoon sleeping between the sheer sides. In the profound silence\r\nthe place had the air of some underground world. The black waters\r\nseemed to have drowsed there since the Creation, unfathomably deep--a\r\nwitch's caldron, where the savage spirits of the hills might show\r\ntheir faces. Even as we gazed the moon came over the crest: the cliff\r\nin front sprang into a dazzling whiteness which shimmered back from\r\nthe lagoon below. Far up on the summit was a great boulder which had a\r\nfar-away likeness to an august human head. As the light fell on it\r\nthe resemblance became a certainty: there were the long locks, the\r\nheavy brows, the profound eyes of a colossal Jove. Not Jove indeed,\r\nfor he was the god of a race, but that elder deity of the natural man,\r\ngrey-haired Saturn, keeping his ageless vigil, quiet as a stone, over\r\nthe generations of his children. Forgotten earth-dwellers, Mosilikatse\r\nand his chiefs, Boer commandos, British yeomanry,--all had passed\r\nbefore those passionless eyes, as their successors will pass and be\r\nforgotten. And in the sense of man's littleness there is comfort, for\r\nit is part of the title of our inheritance. The veld and the mountains\r\ncontinue for ever, austerely impartial to their human occupants: it is\r\nfor the new-comer to prove his right to endure by the qualities which\r\nnature has marked for endurance.\r\n\r\n_August 1902._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WOOD BUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome thirty miles east of Pietersburg, the most northerly railway\r\nstation in the Transvaal, the Leydsdorp coach, which once a-week\r\nimperils the traveller's life, climbs laboriously into a nest of\r\nmountains, and on the summit enters an upland plateau, with shallow\r\nvalleys and green forest-clad slopes. Twenty miles on and the same\r\ncoach, if it has thus far escaped destruction, precipitously descends\r\na mountain-side into the fever flats which line the Groot Letaba and\r\nthe Letsitela. The Leydsdorp road thus cuts off a segment of a great\r\nirregular oblong, which is bounded on the south by the spurs of the\r\nDrakensberg, which the Boers call the Wolkberg or Mountain of Cloud,\r\nand on the north divided by the valley of the Klein Letaba from the\r\nSpelonken. It is a type of country found in patches in the de Kaap\r\nmountains, and in parts of Lydenburg; but here it exists in a\r\ncompletely defined territory of perhaps 700 square miles, divided\r\nsharply from high veld and bush veld. The average elevation may be\r\n5000 feet, and, though cut up into valleys and ridges, it preserves\r\nthe attributes of a tableland, so that on all sides one can journey\r\nto an edge and look down upon a wholly different land. But the\r\ngeographical is the least of its distinctions. The climate has none\r\nof the high-veld dryness or the low-veld closeness, but is humid and\r\nsharp and wholesome all the year round. Mists and cool rains abound,\r\nevery hollow has its stream, and yet frost is rarely known. Its\r\nvegetation, the configuration of its landscape, the soil itself, are\r\nall things by themselves in South Africa. Fever, horse-sickness, and\r\nmost cattle diseases are unknown. It is little explored, for till\r\nquite lately the native tribes were troublesome, and only the poorer\r\nclass of Boer squatted on its occupation farms, and, though a\r\nproclaimed gold-field for some years, the uitlander who strayed there\r\nhad rarely an eye for its beauty. The unfortunate man who took his\r\nlife in his hands and journeyed by coach to Leydsdorp forgot the\r\nlandscape in the perils of the journey, and in all likelihood forgot\r\nmost things in fever at the end of it. It remained, therefore, a\r\nparadise with a few devotees, a place secret and strange, with a beauty\r\nso peculiar that the people who tried to describe it were rarely\r\nbelieved. A delight in the Wood Bush is apt to spoil a man for other\r\nscenery. The high veld seems tame and monotonous, the bush veld an\r\nintolerable desert, and even the mountain glories of the Drakensberg\r\nsomething crude and barbarous after this soft, rich, and fascinating\r\ngarden-land.\r\n\r\nThe mountains come into view a little way from Pietersburg, but there\r\nare many miles of featureless high veld to be covered before the\r\nfoothills are reached. It was midsummer when I first travelled there,\r\nand the dusty waterless plains were glazed by the hot sun. The Sand\r\nRiver, filled with acres of fine sand, but not a drop of moisture, was\r\nnot a cooling object in the scene, and the dusty thorn scrub offered\r\nno shade. But insensibly the country changed. Bold kopjes of rose-red\r\ngranite appeared on the plain, and at a place called Kleinfontein the\r\nroad turned sharply south, and we were confronted with a noble line\r\nof crags running out like a buttress from the mountains. At Smith's\r\nDrift the road swerved east again, and a long valley appeared before\r\nus running up into the heart of the hills. A clear stream came down\r\nit, and the sides were dotted in bush-veld manner with redwood and\r\nsikkelboom and syringa, and a variety of thorns, of which the Kaffir\r\nwaak-en-beetje and the knopjes-doorn were the prettiest. Occasionally\r\nthe dull green of the olivienhout appeared, and when the bush ceased\r\naloes raised their heads among the rocks. Everywhere the mimosa was in\r\nbloom, and the afternoon air was laden with a scent like limes.\r\nTowards the top the valley flattened out into upland meadows, little\r\nfarms appeared dotted on the hillsides, and the yellow mimosa blossom\r\non the slopes was so indistinguishable from gorse that in the\r\nhalf-light I could have sworn I was among Cumberland fells, and not on\r\nthe edge of the tropics and 300 miles from the sea. We assisted a Boer\r\nfarmer to slay a pig, had coffee afterwards with his family, and slept\r\nthe sleep of the just on a singularly hard piece of ground under a\r\nmagnificent sky of stars, being roused once to give a drink to a\r\nbelated member of the S.A.C.\r\n\r\nShortly after dawn next day we toiled to the top of a long hill, and\r\nentered the Wood Bush. A high blue ridge--the Iron Crown mountain\r\nbehind Haenertsburg--rose before us, which changed with the full\r\nlight to a dazzling green, studded in the kloofs with patches of dark\r\nforest. Glimpses of other forest-crowned hills appeared in the\r\nturnings of the path; and when we had exhausted the horizon we had\r\ntime to look at the roadside. It was a perfectly new country. The\r\nsoil was as red as Devonshire, the steep sides oozed with little\r\nrunnels of water. Thickly grassed meadows of the same dazzling yet\r\ndelicate green fell away to the little hollows, where copses took\r\ntheir place, and now and then a small red farm showed in a group of\r\nalien gum-trees. It was so novel as to be almost unbelievable. And\r\nthen in the meadows little shrubs like dwarf hazels appeared, which\r\non closer view showed themselves as tree-ferns,--old gnarled veterans\r\nand young graceful saplings. The herbage, too, was gay with flowers,\r\nas gay as an English meadow save that for daisies there were patches\r\nof tall arums and lilies, and for buttercups a superb golden-belled\r\ncampanula. I am no botanist and am not ashamed of it, but on that\r\nmorning I regretted a wasted youth and many unprofitable hours given\r\nto the classics. By-and-by we descended on the little township of\r\nHaenertsburg, a cluster of rondhavels and the tents of an S.A.C.\r\npost. On leaving we crossed a torrent, the Bruderstroom, which later\r\nbecomes the Groot Letaba and flows through miles of feverish deserts\r\nto join the Olifants and thence to the Limpopo. It was a true\r\nhighland stream, with deep dark-blue pools, and great swirls of icy\r\ngrey water sweeping round crags or stretching out into glistening\r\nshallows. On the high veld it would be dignified by the name of\r\nriver, and be shorn and parcelled into a thousand water-furrows. But\r\nhere it was but one of many, for every hollow had its limpid stream\r\nslipping out of sight among the tall grasses.\r\n\r\nBeyond Haenertsburg the Iron Crown mountain comes into full view, with\r\nits green sides scarred and blackened in places with the works of\r\ngold-seekers. To the left rose the crags of the Wolkberg, and far\r\nbehind the blue lines of the Drakensberg itself. To the north the true\r\nWood Bush country appeared, an endless park laid out as if by a\r\nlandscape gardener, with broad dales set with coppices, and little\r\nwood-covered hills. \"A park-like country,\" is the common travellers'\r\nphrase for the bush veld; but there the grass is rank and ugly, the\r\ntrees isolated thorns, and the whole land flat and waterless. Here was\r\na true park, like Chatsworth or Windsor, so perfectly laid out that one\r\ncould scarcely believe that it was not a work of man. For surely a park\r\nis properly man's work, a flower of civilisation, which nature aids but\r\nrarely contrives. Yet when she does contrive, how far is the result\r\nbeyond our human skill! For an exception the mountain-tops were free\r\nfrom mist; the land lay bathed in a cool morning light, and the scent\r\nof a thousand aromatic herbs--wormwood, southernwood, a glorified\r\nbog-myrtle, musk, and peppermint--rose from the wayside. Bracken was as\r\nplentiful as on a Scots moor, and the old familiar fragrance was like a\r\nbreath of the sea. We breakfasted in a water-meadow, where a spring of\r\ncold water stole away through a forest of tree-ferns, arums, giant\r\norchises, and the tall blue agapanthus. As we smoked our morning pipes\r\nand watched a white eagle and a brace of berghaans circling in the\r\nblue, I vowed that here at last had been found the true Hesperides.\r\n\r\nA few miles on and we were on the farther edge. At a place called\r\nSkellum Kloof the road dips sharply over the crest, and down three\r\nbreak-neck miles to the Groot Letaba. Behind lay the green garden-land;\r\nin front, a hundred miles of broken country, fading in the far distance\r\ninto misty flats. The little range of the Murchison hills ran out at\r\nright angles; away to the north the peaks of Majajie's mountains, with\r\nthe Spelonken beyond, blocked the horizon. As far as the eye could see,\r\nthe faint blue line of the Rooi Rand, the Portuguese border, was just\r\ndistinguishable from the sky, with the fingers of the little Lebombo\r\nbreaking the thin line to the south. One forgot the weary miles of\r\nswamp and fever that lay between, and saw only a glorious sunlit plain,\r\nwhich might have been full of clear rivers and vineyards and white\r\ncities, instead of thorn and Kaffir huts and a few ugly mining\r\nshanties. The Wood Bush on its eastern side is a series of soft green\r\nfolds, with the superb evergreen forest in every kloof. At first sight\r\nthe woods look like hazel copses, and you plunge gaily in to your\r\ndisaster. Below Skellum Kloof is a little wooded glen, into which I\r\ndescended for water, and at one time there were doubts of my ever\r\nemerging again. The place was matted with monkey-creepers, mosses, huge\r\nferns, and a thick undergrowth around the trunks of great trees.\r\nYellowwoods, 200 feet high, essenwood, sneezewood, stinkwood, most of\r\nthem valuable timber-trees, and all with a glossy dark foliage, rose\r\nout of the jungle to the confusion of the poor inhabitant below. I\r\nnoticed some giant royals, some curious orchids, and quantities of\r\nmaidenhair fern and the graceful asparagus creeper. But soon I noticed\r\nlittle beyond the exceeding toilsomeness of the passage. Every step\r\nhad to be fought for, the place was hot to suffocation, and I was in\r\nmortal fear of snakes. Also, I had no desire to meet a bushbuck ram,\r\nthan whom no fiercer fellow for his size exists, at close quarters in\r\nhis native haunts. I kept down-hill, listening for water, and\r\nby-and-by rolled over a red scaur into an ice-cold pool, which was the\r\nonly pleasing thing in the forest. Happily in returning I struck a\r\nnative path, and reached open country in greater comfort. Two boys who\r\nhad been sent to find me--Basutos, and, like all Basutos, fools in a\r\nthick wood--succeeded in getting lost themselves, and had to be\r\nsearched for.\r\n\r\nHereabouts, when my ship comes home, I shall have my country house.\r\nThere is a piece of flat land, perhaps six acres square, from which a\r\nlong glen runs down to the Letaba. There I shall have my dwelling. In\r\nfront there will be a park to put England to shame, miles of rolling\r\ngreen dotted with shapely woods, and in the centre a broad glade in\r\nwhich a salmon-river flows in shallows and falls among tree-ferns,\r\narums, and bracken. There may be a lake, but I am undecided. In front\r\nI shall have a flower-garden, where every temperate and tropical\r\nblossom will appear, and in a sheltered hollow an orchard of\r\ndeciduous trees, and an orange plantation. Highland cattle, imported\r\nat incredible expense, will roam on the hillsides. My back windows\r\nwill look down 4000 feet on the tropics, my front on the long meadow\r\nvista with the Iron Crown mountain for the sun to set behind. My\r\nhouse will be long and low, with broad wings, built of good stone and\r\nwhitewashed, with a thatched roof and green shutters, so that it will\r\nresemble a _prazo_ such as some Portuguese seigneur might have dwelt\r\nin in old times. Within it will be cool and fresh, with stone floors\r\nand big fireplaces, for the mists are chill and the winds can blow\r\nsharply on the mountains. There will be good pictures and books, and\r\nquantities of horns and skins. I shall grow my own supplies, and make\r\nmy own wine and tobacco. Rides will be cut in the woods, and when my\r\nfriends come to stay we shall drive bushbuck and pig, and stalk\r\ntiger-cats in the forest. There will be wildfowl on my lake, and\r\nLochleven trout in my waters. And whoever cares to sail 5000 miles,\r\nand travel 1500 by train, and drive 50 over a rough road, will find\r\nat the end of his journey such a palace as Kubla Khan never dreamed\r\nof. The accomplishment is difficult, but not, I trust, impossible.\r\nOnce upon a time, as the story goes, a Dutchman talked with a\r\npredikant about the welfare of his soul. \"You will assuredly be\r\ndamned,\" said the predikant, \"and burn in hell.\" \"Not so,\" said the\r\nDutchman. \"If I am so unfortunate as to get in there, I shall\r\ncertainly get out again.\" \"But that is folly and an impossibility,\"\r\nsaid the predikant. \"Ah,\" said the other with confidence, \"wait and\r\nsee: I shall make a plan.\" _Ek sal 'n plan maak_--this must be my\r\nmotto, and I shall gratefully accept all honourable suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe country is full of wealth--mines, agriculture, forestry, and\r\npasturage. The presence of payable gold, both in quartz and banket, is\r\nundoubted, and some improvement in the roads, possibly a light\r\nrailway, and the completion of the Selati line may provide for the\r\nrise of Haenertsburg from a very little dorp into a flourishing\r\ntownship. There is magnificent pasturage for stock, for cattle\r\ndiseases are few and horse-sickness is unknown. It has been said that\r\none acre in the Wood Bush will carry an ox, and though this is an\r\nexaggeration, it is certain that the rich herbage will maintain three\r\nor four times the head of stock which can be run on the high veld. The\r\ngrass in spring is very early, and in the worst part of winter the\r\nforests can be resorted to, so that hand-feeding is almost unknown.\r\nThe grass is sour veld, but any extensive pasturing would soon bring\r\nit into the sweet veld class. Once it were properly grazed down, it\r\nwould be also a natural sheep country of high value. The soil is a\r\nclayey red loam, and the moist climate provides perfect conditions for\r\nmost seed crops. Tobacco would thrive well--as well perhaps as on the\r\nlower slopes along the Groot Letaba, where Mr Altenroxel produces\r\nexcellent pipe tobacco and a respectable cigar. It is a paradise for\r\nvegetables, and all hardy fruits and a few sub-tropical ones could be\r\nmade to flourish in the rich straths. It is a land for small holdings,\r\nsave for a few larger farms on the hill-tops, and here might arise a\r\ncommunity of British settlers, making a new England out of a country\r\nwhich already possesses the climate of the West Highlands and the\r\nconfiguration of a Sussex park.\r\n\r\nAt Skellum Kloof we descended from the uplands to an elevation of\r\nabout 2000 feet, a type of scenery half-way between the wholesome high\r\nveld and the pernicious flats of the Lower Letaba. I take that descent\r\nto be all but the worst in the Transvaal, second only to the appalling\r\ncliff over which the road from Lydenburg drops to the Olifants. The\r\ngrades are so steep that with a waggon it is necessary to outspan all\r\nanimals but the two wheelers, and lock the wheels tightly. With a\r\ntwo-wheeled Cape cart to attempt it is to court destruction. Just at\r\nthe foot is an awesome corner, and then a straight slope to the\r\nLetaba, a stream about the size of the Spean and not unlike it. There\r\nis a fine salmon pool below the ford, in which I swam circumspectly,\r\nbeing in dread of stray crocodiles. The valley has nothing of that raw\r\nunfinished look so common in South African landscapes. The peaks rise\r\nin noble contours from long stretches of forest and Kaffir tillage. As\r\nwe crossed, the mist drooped over the hills and we ascended the far\r\nside to our camp in a heavy persistent rain. The whole country was\r\nfull of crying waters, and but for the clumps of wild bananas and the\r\nindescribable African smell, we might have been climbing to a\r\nNorwegian saeter after a long day's fishing.\r\n\r\nAll night it rained in torrents, and next morning--New Year's\r\nDay--dawned in the same driving misty weather. We could not see twenty\r\nyards, and the long sloppy grass and thick red mud of the roads made\r\nbad going even for Afrikander ponies. We sent our heavy transport\r\nback, and, carrying little more than a dry shirt and a toothbrush,\r\nstruck down a track which follows the eastern ridge of the valley. The\r\nvegetation was as dense as any jungle, and swishing through the reeds\r\nand ducking the low branches of trees soaked us to the skin in a few\r\nminutes. But in spite of discomfort it was a fascinating ride. The\r\nheavy tropical scents which the rain brought out of the ground, the\r\nintense silence of the drooping mists and water-laden forests, the\r\nclusters of beehive Kaffir huts in the hollows, all made up a world\r\nstrange and new to the sight and yet familiar to the imagination. This\r\nwas the old Africa of a boy's dream, and there is no keener delight\r\nthan to realise an impression of childhood. Yet, though the air blew\r\nsharp, there was something unwholesome in it. Fever lurked in the\r\ncomely glens, and the clear reaches of the Letaba were not the honest,\r\nif scanty, waters of the high veld. The pungent penetrating smell of\r\nthe herbs we trod underfoot had an uncanniness in it as if all were\r\nsimples and antidotes--a faint medicinal flavour like the ante-chamber\r\nof a physician.\r\n\r\nKrabbefontein, which we reached at mid-day, is a very beautiful\r\nclearing in the woods on the left bank of the river and at the foot\r\nof the Machubi glen. Mr Altenroxel, the owner, farms on a large\r\nscale, and has long been famous for his tropical produce. The\r\nluxuriance of the growth is so great as almost to pass belief.\r\nGum-trees grow from 10 to 15 feet in a year; and we saw a bamboo\r\nfully 50 feet high whose age was under two years. Huge drying-sheds\r\nfor tobacco, numerous well-built outhouses and cottages, wholly the\r\nwork of natives, and a few rondhavels made up the farm-steading. The\r\ntime was past for apricots, but the orchard was full of grenadillas,\r\nfinest of South African fruit, and kei apples; grapes were plentiful;\r\nand in a field of pines we destroyed the remnants of our digestion.\r\nThe owner remained on his farm throughout the war, growing his own\r\nsupplies, which included tea, sugar, and coffee. His tobacco is the\r\nfinest brand of Transvaal pipe-tobacco I have smoked, and he exports\r\nto the towns boxes of light-flavoured but pleasant cigars, making\r\neverything on the farm except the labels. I have rarely seen native\r\nworkers so intelligent and industrious, and the whole place leaves an\r\nimpression of strenuous and enlightened toil. In the bungalow we ate\r\nour New Year's dinner, washed down by excellent German beer, carried\r\nmany miles across the hills. If the conversation at table approached\r\nthe domain of fact at all, the neighbourhood is full of uncanny\r\nthings. A disgusting variety of tarantula, whose bite means death in\r\nhalf an hour, has his home around the tobacco-sheds; puff-adders\r\nabound; and the week before our visit a black mamba had attacked and\r\nkilled a young Dutch girl. We heard, too, many tales of the eastern\r\nhunting-veld, and in the huge dark spaces beyond the rafters we saw\r\nthe shadowy trophies of former hunting trips.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak next morning, in a thick drizzle, we started to reascend\r\nthe mountains. A Kaffir set us on our way, and soon the hills closed\r\nin and we were in the long glen of Machubi. Machubi was a Kaffir chief\r\nwith whom the Boers waged one of their many and most inglorious little\r\nwars. When his people were scattered he took refuge in the thick\r\nforest at the head of the river which bears his name. After my\r\nexperience of that kind of forest I do not wonder that the Boers\r\npreferred not to fight a hand-to-hand battle in its tangled depths.\r\nSo, after their fashion, they hired an impi of Swazis, who sat around\r\nthe wood for three weeks, and ultimately slew the chief--not, however,\r\nbefore he had accounted in single-handed combat for three of his\r\nenemies. Mr Altenroxel possesses the old warrior's skull, which,\r\nexcept for the great thickness at the crown of the head, is finely\r\nshaped, and all but Caucasian in its lines. For this glen of Machubi I\r\nhave nothing but praise: high bush-clad mountains, grey corries,\r\nstreaked with white waterfalls, a limpid hill-stream, and in the flats\r\ngreen patches of Kaffir tillage. But the road--which once was a\r\ncoach-road!--is pure farce. If there is a peculiarly tangled piece of\r\nscrub it dives into it, a really awkward rock and it ascends it, an\r\nunfordable reach of an easy stream and it makes straight for it, a\r\nswamp and it leads you into the deepest and direst part. We had\r\nconstantly to dismount and coax our ponies down and up impossible\r\nsteeps. My little African stallion as a rock-climber was not at his\r\nbest, and I had some awkward positions to get him out of. One in\r\nparticular remains in my memory. A very deep river could only be\r\ncrossed by standing on a stone, leaping to an old log, and thence with\r\na final sprawl to the farther bank. I turned my reins into a halter,\r\nwent in front, and tried to coax my pony. When at last he did it he\r\nall but landed on my chest, and I made the acquaintance of the\r\nhardness of every one of his bones before I got him out of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe road climbs a spur in the fork of two streams, and as one ascends\r\nand looks up the narrow twin glens, the old exquisite green of the\r\ntrue Wood Bush takes the place of the sadder colours of the lowlands.\r\nThe heads of the glens have the form of what are called in the north\r\nof England and Scotland \"hopes,\" rounded green cup-shaped hollows;\r\nonly here all things are on a larger scale, and the evergreen forest\r\ntakes the place of birch and juniper in the corries. The road wound\r\nthrough wood and bracken, now coming out clear on a knoll, and now\r\nsinking to the level of some little stream. The mist which had covered\r\nthe mountains was clearing, and one after another the green summits\r\ncame forth like jewels against the pale morning sky. The tropical\r\nscents ceased, the sun shone out, and suddenly we were on the neck of\r\nthe pass with a meadow-land country falling away from our feet. It was\r\nstill hazy, but as we breakfasted the foreground slowly cleared.\r\nLittle white roads sped away over the shoulders of hill; a rushing\r\nstream appeared in a hollow with one noble waterfall. Still the\r\nlandscape opened; wood after wood came into being, glistening like\r\nemeralds in the dawn; long sweeps of pasture, each with its glimpse of\r\nwater, carried the eye to where the great Drakensberg, blue and\r\ndistant, was emerging from the fleecy mists of morning. Once more we\r\nwere in the enchanted garden-land.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to describe the awesome and the immense, but it is hard\r\nindeed to convey an adequate impression of exceeding charm and\r\nrichness. Hard, at least, in dull prose. A line of gleaming poetry,\r\nsuch as Herrick's--\r\n\r\n    \"Here in green meadows sits Eternal May,\"\r\n\r\nor Theocritus's--\r\n\r\n    ~pant' osden thereos mala pionos osde d' oporas~,\r\n\r\nwill convey more of the true and intimate charm than folios of\r\nelaborated description. The main feature of the place is its sharp\r\ndistinction from the common South African landscape. The high veld\r\nwith its vast spaces, the noble mountain ravines, the flats of the\r\nbush veld, have all their own charm; but the traveller is plagued with\r\nthe something unfriendly and austere in their air, as if all thought\r\nof human life had been wanting in their creation. They are built on a\r\nscale other than ours; man's labour has in the last resort no power to\r\nchange them. They remain rough, unfinished, eternally strange, a\r\ncountry to admire, but scarcely to adopt and understand. But this\r\ngarden-ground is wholly human. Natura Benigna was the goddess who\r\npresided at its creation, and no roughness enters into the \"warm,\r\ngreen-muffled\" slopes, the moist temperate weather, and the limpid\r\nwaters. It is England, richer, softer, kindlier, a vast demesne laid\r\nout as no landscape gardener could ever contrive, waiting for a human\r\nlife worthy of such an environment. But it is more--it is that most\r\nfascinating of all types of scenery, a garden on the edge of a\r\nwilderness. And such a wilderness! Over the brink of the meadow, four\r\nthousand feet down, stretch the steaming fever flats. From a cool\r\nfresh lawn you look clear over a hundred miles of nameless savagery.\r\nThe first contrast which fascinates the traveller is between the\r\ncommon veld and this garden; but the deeper contrast, which is a\r\nperpetual delight to the dweller, is between his temperate home and\r\nthe rude wilds beyond his park wall.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be the fate of it? There is no reason why it should not\r\nbecome at once a closely settled farming country. If the Pietersburg\r\nline is looped round between Magatoland and the Spelonken and brought\r\nsouth to meet a line from Leydsdorp, this intervening plateau will\r\nhave a ready access to markets. The place, too, may become a famous\r\nsanatorium, to which the worried town-dwellers may retire to recover\r\nhealth from the quiet greenery. Country houses may spring up, and what\r\nis now the preserve of a few enthusiasts may become in time the Simla\r\nor Saratoga of the Transvaal. How much, I wonder, will the new-comers\r\nsee of its manifold graces? Any one can appreciate the mellow air, the\r\nrestful water-meadows, the profound stillness of the deep-bosomed\r\nhills. These are physical matters, making a direct appeal to the\r\nsimpler senses. But for the rest? It is the place for youth, youth\r\nwith high spirit and wide horizon, sensitive to scenery and weather,\r\nloving wild nature and adventure for their own noble sakes. How much,\r\nI wonder, will they see of it all--the people who have the purse to\r\ncompass health resorts and the constitutions to need them? For here,\r\nas in all places of subtle and profound beauty, there is need of the\r\nseeing eye and the understanding heart.\r\n\r\n            \"We receive but what we give,\r\n    And in our life alone does Nature live;\r\n    Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shroud!\r\n    And would we aught behold of higher worth\r\n    Than that inanimate cold world allowed\r\n    To the poor loveless, ever-anxious crowd,\r\n    Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth\r\n    A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud\r\n    Enveloping the earth.\"\r\n\r\nI do not think that the place will ever become staled. The special\r\ncorrespondent will not rhapsodise over it--he will find many places\r\nbetter worthy of his genius; the voice of the halfpenny paper will\r\nnot, I think, be heard in that land. Its appeal is at once too obvious\r\nand too subtle: too obvious in its main features to please the common\r\nconnoisseur, too subtle and remote for the wayfaring man to penetrate.\r\nIt will remain, I trust, the paradise of a few--a paradise none the\r\nless their own because towns and hotels and country houses may have\r\nsprung up throughout it. To such it will always appear (as it appeared\r\nto us when we took farewell of it from the summit above Haenertsburg\r\nand saw the hills and glades sleeping in the mellow afternoon) an\r\nold-world Arcadia, a lost classic land which Nature with her artist's\r\nhumour has created in this raw unstoried Africa.\r\n\r\n_December 1902-January 1903._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nON THE EASTERN VELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMachadodorp, that straggling village called after a Portuguese\r\ncommander, is the most easterly outpost of the high veld. A few\r\nmiles farther and there is a sheer fall into narrow mountain glens,\r\ndown which the Elands River and the Delagoa Bay Railway make the\r\nbest of their way to the lowlands. North lies the hill country of\r\nLydenburg, to which the traveller may come in a coach after a day of\r\nheart-breaking hills and neck-breaking descents. But south for a\r\ngood hundred miles sweeps the high veld in a broad promontory from\r\nMachadodorp to the Pongola, and on the east to the Swaziland border.\r\nIt is the highest part of the great central tableland, and a very\r\nbleak dwelling-place in winter; but in summer and autumn it has a\r\nfull share of the curious veld beauty. In particular, being in the\r\nline of the Drakensberg, you can come to its edge and look over into\r\nthe wild tangle of glens which lie between you and the Lebombo\r\nhills. Also it is the lake district of South Africa, being full of\r\ntarns of all sizes from Lake Chrissie, which is a respectable sheet\r\nof water, to the tiniest reed-filled pan. It is the coldest,\r\nfreshest, and windiest part of the land, a tonic country where the\r\ninhabitants are rarely ill, and few doctors can make a living.\r\n\r\nThe journey to the first outspan from Machadodorp on the Ermelo road\r\nis a little monotonous, for you are not yet on the ridge of the high\r\nveld, the grass is rank, and the landscape featureless. You are\r\npursued, too, by an unfinished railway, the Machadodorp-Carolina line,\r\nand if there is an uglier thing than the raw scar made by earthworks\r\nand excavations and uncompleted culverts, I do not know it. The line\r\nis being taken over by Government, and the sooner it is laid the\r\nbetter, for at present the richest farming population in the Transvaal\r\nare some sixty miles from a rail-head. At the fine stone bridge of the\r\nKomati you enter a more pleasing country, with a glimpse to the east\r\nof a gap in the hills through which the river enters the broken\r\ncountry. The Komati here is a slow high-veld stream creeping through\r\nlong muddy pools with the slenderest of currents, but some eight\r\nmiles down it is a hill torrent. This is one of the paradoxes of the\r\nhigh-veld rivers. Elsewhere it is in their cradle that streams have\r\ntheir \"bright speed\"; here the infant river must be content to creep\r\nlike a canal, and lo! when it is almost full grown, it finds itself\r\nhurled in cataracts down a mountain valley. Who, seeing the Olifants\r\nnear Middelburg, can ever believe that it is the same stream which\r\nswirls round a corner of the berg north of Ohrigstad; or, watching\r\nthe sluggish Umpilusi crawling through the high veld, find any\r\nkinship between it and the Swaziland salmon-river? It is a romantic\r\ncareer--first a chain of half-stagnant pools, then a cataract, and\r\nthen a full-grown river, rolling its yellow waters through leagues of\r\nbush and jungle to the tropical ocean.\r\n\r\nFrom Everard's store, which is a pleasant outspan among trees, the\r\nroad climbs steeply to the ridge of the country. A tremendous sweep\r\nof veld comes into view, stretching to the west in hazy leagues till\r\nthe eyes dazzle with the soft contours and infinite lines, and in the\r\neast barred at a great distance by a faint blue range, the Ingwenya\r\nMountains. The first pan appeared, no larger than an English mill-dam,\r\nand overgrown with reeds which made a patch of darker green against\r\nthe veld. One had the sensation of being somewhere on the roof of the\r\nworld, for on every horizon but one the land sloped to a lower\r\naltitude, and even on the east the mountains seemed foreshortened,\r\nlike the masts of a vessel just coming into sight at sea. Presently a\r\nlittle white dorp, Carolina, appeared some miles away on the left,\r\nwith that curious look of a Pilgrim's Progress village which so many\r\nveld townships possess. Then miles on miles of the same green\r\ndownland, the road now sinking into little valleys with a glimpse of\r\nfarm-steadings, and now holding the ridge in the centre of the\r\namphitheatre. As the autumn evening fell, and the soft lights bathed\r\nthe landscape, it became a spectral world, a Tir-an-Oig, in which it\r\nwas difficult to believe that this rose-coloured slope was not a dream\r\nor that purple clump of trees a mirage. Little lochs appeared, some\r\nolive-green with rushes, some cold and black with inky waves lapping\r\non dazzling white shores. Water, in Novalis' quaint fancy, is as the\r\neye to a landscape, the one thing generally lacking in the blind\r\ninfinity of the veld. Strings of wild-geese passed over our heads, and\r\nfrom the meadow bottoms there came the call of ducks and now and then\r\nthe bark of a korhaan. Curious echoes arose as we passed, for there is\r\nsomething in the geological structure of the country which makes it\r\nfull of eerie noises. And then, as darkness closed down, a long piece\r\nof water appeared, beyond which rose a little hill with two woods of\r\nblue gum and a light between them. A nearer view showed a trim\r\ncottage, with Kaffir huts around it, the beginnings of a garden, and,\r\neven in the dusk, a glimpse of long lines of crops stretching down to\r\nthe lake. It was the homestead of Florence, which stands on the apex\r\nof a large block of Crown land, and is used as the headquarters of the\r\nland commissioner of the eastern district.\r\n\r\nFrom Florence to the Swaziland border is some fifty miles as the crow\r\nflies, so at dawn our horses were saddled, and, with a mule-cart for\r\nprovisions, we set out towards the remote hills. The morning had begun\r\nin a Scots mist, but by ten o'clock the sky was cloudless, and the\r\nintense blue of the lakes, the white shores, and the many patches of\r\nmarl on the slopes caught the sun with a bewildering glare. The water\r\nin the pans is generally brackish, but some few are fresh, and one in\r\nparticular, about four miles long, has wooded islets and a bold white\r\nbluff like a chalk cliff. The names are mostly Scots--Blairmore,\r\nArdentinny, Hamilton,--for the land was first bought and settled by a\r\nGlasgow company. They are almost all stock farms, with little\r\nirrigation except along the Umpilusi; and many are fenced, efficiently\r\nenough, with slabs of stone for uprights. On one farm, Lake Banagher,\r\nwe rode past a herd of some 300 or 400 blesbok and springbok, which\r\nare preserved by Mr Schalk Meyer, the owner. About noon we came into\r\nthe shallow vale of the Umpilusi, and left it again for a high ridge,\r\nwhence all afternoon we had a view of rolling country to the south,\r\nwith the Slaangaapies mountains on the horizon. The great hills in the\r\nnorth of Swaziland were faint but clear, though we were still too high\r\nourselves to see them to advantage. The country began to change, the\r\nvalleys became almost glens, a great deal of tumbled rock appeared\r\novergrown with bush and bracken, and everything spoke of the\r\nbeginnings of a mountain country, which, strangely enough, we were\r\napproaching from above. In the late afternoon we came to large belts\r\nof trees around a ruined farmhouse, and as the sky was beginning to\r\nthreaten we outspanned for the night. We were not more than half a\r\ndozen miles from the Swazi border and in full sight of it--a chain of\r\nlittle kopjes with a hint of faint mountains behind.\r\n\r\nThe farmhouse was an odd place seen in that stormy dusk. Thick woods\r\nof blue-gum and pine surrounded it, and below, also hemmed in by\r\ntrees, was a lush water-meadow. The house had been a substantial stone\r\nbuilding, but it was stripped to the walls, every scrap of woodwork\r\nhaving been used by the troops for fuel. The broken stoep was\r\novergrown with moon-flowers, whose huge white blossoms gleamed\r\nuncannily in the shadows. We pushed through the wood and the overgrown\r\npaddock to a neglected orchard, where the fruit-trees had lost all\r\nsemblance of their former selves, and struggled vainly among creepers\r\nand high grasses, and thence to the meadow where a little reddish\r\nstream trickled through the undergrowth. Owls flitted about like the\r\nghosts of the place, and this relic of war with its moated-grange\r\nmelancholy had a depressing effect on our spirits. We gladly sought\r\nour camp in an old barn on higher ground, where a blazing fire\r\nrestored us to cheerfulness. The rain never fell, and the morning\r\ndawned grey and misty, so that when we set out for the border we had\r\nlittle hope of a view. We passed some Swazi kraals, and got directions\r\nfrom their picturesque occupants. The men are active and tall, and\r\ntheir wives with their curious head-dresses are better to look at\r\nthan the sluttish native women of the central districts. They are\r\nbeautiful dancers, and the performance of a body of Swazis in war\r\ncostume is a thing to remember. The country began to be extremely\r\nrocky, and tree-ferns and other specimens of sub-tropical vegetation\r\nappeared in the hollows. One glossy-leaved bush bore a berry about the\r\nsize and shape of a rasp, called by the natives \"infanfaan,\" which had\r\nan agreeable sub-acid flavour. A little hill, looking as if it were\r\nmade of one single gigantic boulder, appeared on the right, and with\r\nsome scrambling we got our horses to the foot of it. This was Bell's\r\nKop, a famous landmark, and beyond and below was Swaziland.\r\n\r\nThe morning had cleared, and though the horizons were misty, we saw\r\nenough to reward us. The ground fell sharply away from our feet to a\r\ngreen glen studded with trees, down which a white road wound. A hill\r\nshut the glen, but over the hill and at a much lower altitude we saw\r\nthe strath of the Umpilusi, with the river running in wide sweeps with\r\nshores of gravel, not unlike the Upper Spey as seen from the\r\nGrampians. Beyond were tiers of broken blue hills, rising very high\r\ntowards the north, where they culminate in Piggs' Peak, but fading\r\nsouthward into a misty land where lay the Lebombo flats. The grey soft\r\nair had an intense stillness, a kind of mountain melancholy, but far\r\nto the south there was a patch of sunlight on the green hills above\r\nAmsterdam. It is a type of view which can be had in all parts of the\r\nDrakensberg, from Mont aux Sources frowning over Natal to the\r\nSpelonken looking down on the plains of the Letaba--a view to me of\r\ninfinite charm, for you stand upon the dividing line between two forms\r\nof country and two climates, looking back upon the endless prairies\r\nand their fresh winds and forward upon warm glens and the remote\r\nmalarial tropics.\r\n\r\nFrom Bell's Kop we fetched a wide circuit, going to Amsterdam, which\r\nwas not more than fifteen miles from where we stood, by Florence and\r\nErmelo, a journey of over 100 miles. The afternoon ride was something\r\nto remember, for the day had cleared into a bright afternoon with cool\r\nwinds blowing, and the green ridges had a delicate pastoral beauty, as\r\nof sunlit sheep-walks. When we forded the Umpilusi its sluggish pools\r\nwere glowing with the fires of sunset. Cantering in the hazy twilight\r\nof the long slopes was pure romance, and the sounds from a Kaffir\r\nkraal, the slow mild-eyed oxen on the road, and the wheeling of wild\r\nbirds had all the strangeness of things seen and heard in a dream. I\r\nknow no such tonic for the spirits, for in such a scene and at such a\r\ntime the blood seems to run more freely in the veins, the mind to be\r\npurged from anxious indolence, and the whole nature to become joyous\r\nand receptive. Much comes from the air. There is something in those\r\nspaces of clear absolute ether, eternally wide, fresh as spring water,\r\npure as winds among snow, which not only sustains but vitalises and\r\nrejuvenates the body. There is something, too, in the life. Fine\r\nscenery is too often witnessed by men when living the common life of\r\ncivilisation and enjoying the blessings of a good cook and a not\r\nindifferent cellar. But on the veld there is bare living and hard\r\nriding, so that a man becomes thin and hard and very much alive, the\r\ndross of ease is purged away, and body and mind regain the keen temper\r\nwhich is their birthright.\r\n\r\nWe outspanned at a Boer farm and dined with the family off home-made\r\nbread, _confyt_, and tea. They were very hospitable and friendly, and\r\ndiscussed the war and current politics with all freedom. The walls\r\nwere adorned with numerous portraits of _British_ generals; and the\r\nfarmer, who had been in Bermuda, displayed with much pride the\r\ncarvings with which he had beguiled his captivity. One of the sons\r\nread assiduously a Dutch translation of one of Mayne Reid's novels,\r\nand when he could tear himself from the narrative contributed to the\r\ntalk some details of his commando-life under Ben Viljoen, for whom, in\r\ncommon with most of the younger Dutch, he had a profound admiration.\r\nThese people are a strange mixture--so hospitable, that the traveller\r\nis ashamed to go near a Boer farm, seeing the straitness of their lives\r\nand the generosity with which they give what they have; and yet so\r\nsqualid that they make little effort to better their condition. This\r\nparticular farmer owned four large farms, worth in the present market\r\nnot less than L20,000; the sale of one or a part of one would have\r\ngiven him ample means to buy stock and start again. But he was content\r\nto go on as he was, running up a long bill with the Repatriation depot,\r\nand grumbling at the high prices for stock compared with what he had\r\nbeen used to pay. The result was that, though he had been back for nine\r\nmonths, I saw no living thing on that farm but a few chickens, six\r\ngoats, and a spavined horse.\r\n\r\nWe made the last stage to Florence shortly after sunrise, and arrived\r\nat the homestead in time for breakfast. The twenty odd miles to Ermelo\r\nwere the easy journey of an afternoon. We passed the ruined township\r\nof Chrissie, with a roofless kirk and some flourishing plantations of\r\nfirs. The lake itself lay over some meadows, a pear-shaped piece of\r\nwater, very shallow, and at its greatest perhaps some six or eight\r\nmiles round. Yet in spite of its shallowness there is ample depth for\r\na small centre-board; and when the railway is completed and Chrissie\r\nbecomes a summer sanatorium, there is no reason why a modest kind of\r\nyachting should not be enjoyed. For the rest it is a bare road, with\r\noutcrops of coal appearing here and there, and the infant Vaal to be\r\ncrossed, a very mean and muddy little stream. You come on Ermelo with\r\nsurprise, dipping over the brow of a barren ridge and seeing a\r\ncheerful little town beneath you. It suffered heavily in the war,\r\nbeing literally levelled with the ground, but when we passed most of\r\nthe houses had been cobbled together and new buildings were arising.\r\nIt lies in a rich mineral tract, and is also the centre of a wide\r\npastoral district, so with improved communications it may very well\r\nbecome a thriving country town. Whoever laid it out showed good\r\njudgment in the planting of trees; and in that bare land it is\r\npleasant to come on such a village in a wood. My chief recollection of\r\nErmelo is of a talk with a deputation of neighbouring farmers on the\r\nsubject of cattle diseases. One admirable old man explained his\r\nperplexity. \"Formerly,\" he said, \"we used to be told that all diseases\r\ncame from on High. Now we are told that some are from on High and some\r\nare our own fault. But which is which? Personally,\" he concluded, \"I\r\nbelieve that Providence is a good deal to blame for them all.\"\r\n\r\nAbout noon the following day we set out for Amsterdam. The first part\r\nof the road is monotonous, for it follows a straight line of\r\nblockhouses in a bleak featureless country. We crossed the inevitable\r\nVaal again, a little larger and perhaps a little dirtier, but not\r\nappreciably more attractive. Sometimes we came to a flat moor like\r\nRannoch with faint blue mountains beyond it, but the common type was a\r\nsuccession of ridges without a shade of difference between them. The\r\nweather had broken, and dust-coloured showers pursued us over the face\r\nof the heavens, till, as we came in sight of the considerable hill of\r\nBankkop, the whole sky behind us had darkened for a wet evening. As we\r\ncame down from the height, where the colour of the roads told of coal,\r\nand entered a green marshy valley, the storm burst on us,--a true\r\nAfrican rain which drenches a man in two minutes. We sought shelter in\r\na farmhouse, or rather in a blockhouse in the stackyard, for there was\r\nlittle left of the house except a shanty which the owner had restored\r\nfor his present accommodation. All evening it rained in solid sheets,\r\nand to dinner, a meal cooked under difficulties, the Boer farmer came\r\nand talked to us, sitting on a barrel and telling stories of the war.\r\nHe had the ordinary tale--against the war at the start, compelled to\r\nfight, had remonstrated with Louis Botha on his conduct of the Natal\r\ncampaign, and, grumbling greatly, had followed his leader till he was\r\ncaught and sent to Ceylon. The Boer discipline must have been a\r\ncurious growth, and, when we realise the intense individualism of the\r\nfighting men, we begin to see the greatness of the achievement of\r\nBotha and Delarey in keeping them together at all. Our friend was\r\nliving in squalid penury, but he was drawing enough in mineral options\r\non his farm to have restocked it and lived in comfort, if he had\r\npleased. There is no doubt in my mind, after such experiences, as to\r\nwhat would have been the wisest and kindest form of repatriation for\r\nlandowners, had we had the courage to adopt it,--compulsory sale of a\r\nportion of the farm, and out of the capital thus supplied the farmer\r\ncould have bought what he wanted at reasonable prices from Government\r\ndepots. Such a method would have given the Government more good land,\r\nwhich it urgently wants; it would have saved the endless credit\r\naccounts which in the long-run will give trouble both to Boer and\r\nGovernment; and it would have saved the pauperisation into which the\r\nBoer is only too ready to sink. There would, of course, have been many\r\nexceptions in the case of the very poor and landless classes, but for\r\nthe landholder it would have been not only the most politic but in his\r\neyes the most intelligible plan.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the night spent in that blockhouse. Every known\r\nform of vermin--fleas, bugs, mosquitoes, spiders, rats, and, for all I\r\nknow, snakes--came out of the holes where they had fasted for months\r\nand attacked us. I lay for hours swathed in a kaross, my face\r\ntingling, watching through the open square of door a melancholy moon\r\ntrying to show herself among the rain-clouds, and wishing I had had\r\nthe wisdom to sleep on the wet veld rather than in that chamber of\r\nhorrors. Sheer bodily weariness induced a few uneasy hours of sleep,\r\nbut the first ray of dawn found me thankfully arising. We breakfasted\r\nin haste, inspanned hurriedly, and were on the road an hour after\r\nsunrise. A long ascent brought us to the ridge of those hills of which\r\nBankkop and Spitzkop are part, an extension of the Drakensberg from\r\nWakkerstroom across the veld to the Swazi border. Then we passed over\r\nsome very flat meadows to another ridge, from which we had a clear\r\nview of the Slaangaapies mountains to the south, and before us to the\r\nnorth-east the long green range of hills above Amsterdam. It was a\r\ncurious picture for the Transvaal, a line of hills with regular glens\r\nand soft contours unbroken by rock or tree, and at the foot in a wood\r\na few white cottages--a reminiscence of Galloway or Tweeddale; and\r\none can well understand how the Scots settlers, who founded the place\r\nand gave it its first name of Robburnia after their national poet, saw\r\nin the landscape a picture of their home. We skirted the village on\r\nthe left, and found the farm where we were to outspan. Here heroic\r\nmeasures were taken to get rid of the results of the blockhouse. A\r\nlarge tub was filled with hot water, and a bottle of sheep-dip was\r\nemptied into it. In this mixture we wallowed, and emerged from it\r\nscarified but clean.\r\n\r\nThe farm was the property of a Scots gentleman, who in six months had\r\nmade new water-furrows, built himself a comfortable house, put over\r\n200 acres under crops, and was running a fair head of stock on the\r\nhills. In the afternoon we rode with him to Mr Forbes' farm of Athole,\r\nsome three miles off, which is perhaps the largest private landed\r\nestate in one piece in the country. It runs to some 60,000 acres, a\r\nhuge square tract between two streams, from which is obtained a fine\r\nprospect of the Swaziland hills. Mr Forbes, who owns much land across\r\nthe border, is one of the two or three living Englishmen who know the\r\nSwazis best, having for fifty years or more traded, farmed, and mined\r\nin their country. Before the war Athole was a great game-preserve,\r\nwith 3000 blesbok, 2000 springbok, as well as reed-buck, impala, the\r\ntwo rheboks, and a few klipspringer. Now some odd springbok along the\r\nstream are almost all that remain. But when Mr Forbes first came to\r\nthe place eland, koodoo, and hartebeest were the common game, and one\r\ncould kill a lion on most farms. Of the original Scots settlers, who\r\ngave the name of New Scotland to the district, a few still remain, and\r\ntheir farms can be told far off by the neat strips of plantation which\r\nmake the place like a hillside in Ayrshire. The land was acquired\r\nvery cheaply from the Government,--one farm, if tales be true, going\r\nfor a pair of boots, and another for a keg of whisky. The Boers\r\nthemselves bought the whole tract from the Swazi border to Ermelo, and\r\nfrom the Komati in the north to the Pongola in the south--perhaps 3000\r\nsquare miles--from the Swazi king for 150 oxen and 50 blankets. As at\r\nthat time an ox was worth about 30s., it was not a high price, and the\r\nBoers still further improved the bargain by declining to pay the\r\nblankets. When Mr Forbes came to the place he was visited by a\r\ndeputation of Swazi chiefs to discuss the subject, and to save trouble\r\ngave them the blankets from his own stores.\r\n\r\nIn Amsterdam next morning I was taken for a prospector, and played the\r\npart for a considerable time, to the confusion of an ex-official of\r\nthe place, who wished to profit by my knowledge, but could make\r\nneither head nor tail of my answers. It is a sleepy little town, with\r\nnot more than half a dozen houses lying pleasantly in gardens, with\r\nmountain streams on all sides and pastoral green hills to the east and\r\nnorth. South, where lay our road, are swelling moorlands, flanked by\r\nthe Slaangaapies and the Swazi hills, and crossed at frequent\r\nintervals by clear grey streams. The first of these is the Compies, a\r\nfew miles from the village, and a more naturally perfect trout-stream\r\nI have rarely seen. There were deep blue pools, and long shallow\r\nstretches, and little rapids in whose tail one should have been able\r\nto get a salmon. When trout become thoroughly acclimatised in the\r\nTransvaal, and the proper waters are stocked, he will be a happy man\r\nwho owns a mile or two of the Compies. As if to intensify the\r\natmosphere of fishing, it began to rain heavily and a cold mist blew\r\nup from the south. The long grass became hoar with rain-drops, and the\r\ninnumerable veld watercourses found their voices after months of dry\r\nsilence. Still more lipping grey streams, and then the rain ceased as\r\nsuddenly as it had come, and in a deceptive gleam of sunlight we came\r\ninto Piet Retief. It is a long, straggling, dingy village lying on two\r\nridges. The mountains on all sides are too far off to be a feature in\r\none's view of it, and save that it is one of the backdoors to\r\nSwaziland, there is little of interest for the traveller. At the\r\nentrance you pass a monument to Piet Retief, of which only the\r\npedestal is completed--a poor tribute to a great man.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch the rain began again in real earnest, and there was\r\nnothing for it but to loiter through the afternoon in waterproofs and\r\nhope for a dry morrow. It is not the most cheerful of places, but seen\r\nthrough the pauses of the driving wrack it had a wild charm of its\r\nown. In particular the Slaangaapies mountains, a dozen miles off, when\r\nby any chance they were visible for a moment, stood out black and\r\nthreatening, with white cataracts seaming their sides and murky\r\nshadows in their glens. The Dutch name means \"Snake-monkeys,\" but the\r\nnatives call them beautifully \"The Mother of Rains.\" The inhabitants\r\nof the district are almost the lowest type in the Transvaal,--poor,\r\ndisreputable, half-bred, despised by their neighbours and neglected by\r\nthe late Government. The progressive element in the district is\r\nrepresented by a German colony, who were originally placed there by\r\nthe wily Boer as a buffer against the natives, but who throve and\r\nmultiplied and now own the best farms in the district. The most\r\ninteresting thing I saw in the place was a large Boer hound, with the\r\nhair on the ridge of his back growing in an opposite direction to the\r\nrest of his coat. Now this type is rare, and, when found, makes the\r\nfinest hunting dog in the world, for he will tackle a charging lion,\r\nand, indeed, fears nothing created. I had often been advised if I came\r\nacross such a dog to buy him at any price, but in this case his Dutch\r\nowner utterly refused to sell, and I had to depart in envious gloom.\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak next morning, in a mist which clothed the world like a\r\ngarment, so that we walked in fleecy vapour, we set off on the sixty\r\nmiles' journey to Wakkerstroom. The first half is through an\r\nexceedingly dreary land. We crossed the Assegai, a finely named but\r\ninglorious stream, chiefly remarkable for its rapid flooding, and then\r\nfor a score of miles we ascended and descended little sandy hills, and\r\nsaw on each side of the road as far as the edge of the mist the same\r\nendless coarse herbage. In fine weather there is the wall of\r\nSlaangaapies to give dignity to the landscape; but for us there was\r\nonly a bank of cloud. Before our mid-day outspan the sky cleared a\r\nlittle, and huge stony blue hills appeared on our left, with bush\r\nstraggling up their sides and stray sun-gleams on their bald summits.\r\nWe outspanned for lunch at Vanderpoel's store, which is a couple of\r\nhuts in a perfectly flat dusty plain with a fine ring of hazy\r\nmountains around it. The day became exceedingly hot, still cloudy, but\r\nwith a dazzle behind the mists which it hurt the eye to look at,--the\r\nkind of weather which makes the cheeks flame and tires the traveller\r\nfar more readily than a clear sun and a blue sky. Again the same hills\r\nand dales, but now with a gradually increasing elevation, till when we\r\ncame to a fine stream falling over a precipice into a meadow and\r\nlooked back, we saw the Slaangaapies as if from a neighbour hill-top.\r\nA curious little peak appeared on the right, with what the Dutch call\r\na _castrol_ or saucepan on its head, a perfectly round ring of\r\nkranzes which presented the appearance of an extinguisher dropped\r\ndown suddenly on the summit. It is a common sight in this part of the\r\nBerg, where the great original chain of cliffs has been broken and\r\nhills lie tumbled about like the _debris_ of greater mountains.\r\n\r\nAt Joubert's Hoogte the road emerges from the glens, and the south\r\nopens up into a mazy tangle of hills. It is one of the noblest views\r\nin the country; but for us the mist curtailed the perspective, while\r\nit greatly increased the mystery. Shapes of mountains floating through\r\na haze have far more fascination for the lover of highlands than a\r\nlong prospect to a clearly defined horizon. Below lay the broad woody\r\nvalley of the Upper Pongola, shut off in the east by the spurs of the\r\nSlaangaapies. The far mist was flecked with little sun-gleams, which\r\nshowed now an emerald slope, now the grey and black of a cliff, and\r\nnow a white flash of water. The air had the intense stillness of grey\r\nweather and great height; only the neighing of our horses broke in\r\nupon what might have been the first chaos out of which the world\r\nemerged. Thence for a few miles we kept on the ridge till we dipped\r\ninto the hollow of a stream and slowly climbed a long pass where the\r\nroad clung to the edges of precipitous slopes and wriggled among great\r\nrocks. The mist closed down, and but for the feeling in the air which\r\nspoke of wider spaces, we could not have told that we had reached the\r\ntop of Castrol's Nek, the gate of the South-Eastern Transvaal. A\r\nConstabulary notice plastered on a weather-worn board was another sign\r\nthat the place was a known landmark. As soon as we passed the summit\r\nthe country grew softer. The shoulders of hills seemed greener, and\r\nalong the little watercourses bracken and a richer vegetation\r\nappeared. The evening was falling, and as we slipped down the winding\r\nroad the white mist faded into deeper and deeper grey, till at last we\r\nemerged from it and saw a clear sky above us and hills standing out\r\nblack and rain-washed against the yellows of sunset. By-and-by in the\r\ncentre of the amphitheatre of mountains a dozen lights twinkled out,\r\nand in a little we were off-saddling very weary horses in the pleasant\r\ntown of Wakkerstroom.\r\n\r\n_March-April 1903._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NORTH ROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe romance which is inseparable from all roads belongs especially to\r\nthose great arteries of the world which traverse countries and\r\ncontinents, and unite different zones and climates, and pass through\r\nextreme variations of humankind. For in them the adventurous sense of\r\nthe unknown, which is found in a country lane among hedgerows, becomes\r\nan ever-present reality to the most casual traveller. And it is a\r\npeculiarity of the world's roads that this breath of romance blows\r\nmost strongly on the paths which point to the Pole-star. The AEmilian\r\nWay, up which the Roman legions clanked to the battlefields of Gaul\r\nand Britain, or that great track which leads through India to the\r\nmountains of the north and thence to the steppes of Turkestan,\r\ncaptures the fancy more completely than any lateral traverse of the\r\nglobe. A way which passes direct through the widest extremes of\r\nweather, and is in turn frozen and scorched or blown in sand, has an\r\nair of purpose which is foreign to long tracks in the same latitude,\r\nand carries a more direct impress of the shaping and audacious spirit\r\nof man. Of all north roads I suppose the greatest to be that which\r\nruns from the Cape to Egypt, greatest both for its political meaning,\r\nthe strangeness of the countries to which it penetrates, the\r\ndifficulties and terrors of the journey, and, above all, for the fact\r\nthat it is a traverse of the extreme length of a vast and mysterious\r\ncontinent. It has been associated in the south with the schemes of a\r\ngreat dreamer, and in the north with the practical work of a great\r\nsoldier and a great administrator. Between these two beginnings we all\r\nbut lose trace of it in wilds of sand and swamp, the dense forests,\r\nthe lakes and the wild mountains of Equatorial Africa, penetrated at\r\nrare intervals by native paths and old hunters' tracks. But to the eye\r\nof faith the road is there, marching on with single purpose from one\r\nrailway head on the veld to another in the Soudanese desert. The men\r\nwho travel it are hunters and prospectors, a few soldiers, a chance\r\nofficial, and once and again an explorer: but they travel only short\r\nstages, and there are few indeed who, like my friend Mr E. S. Grogan,\r\ncarry their staff and scrip from end to end of it. To the amateur,\r\nlike the present writer, who goes a little way on it, the thought of\r\nthis majestic Way gives dignity to the ill-defined sandy track in\r\nwhich he may be floundering, and makes each northern horizon seem like\r\nthe hill-tops of the Apennines, somewhere behind which, as the pilgrim\r\nis confident, lie the towers and pinnacles of Rome. I would recommend\r\nas a panacea for cold and comfortless nights on the road that the mind\r\nof the traveller should occupy itself with a projected itinerary. He\r\nwill see the Road running as a hunter's path from the Limpopo to the\r\nZambesi--through thorn scrub and park-land and stony mountain. Then he\r\nwill travel up the Shire by Nyassaland and on by Tanganyika to\r\nRuwenzori and the lakes; and if he is not asleep by the time he has\r\nseen the sun rise on Albert Nyanza and fought his way through the\r\nDinkas and the mosquitoes of the Nile swamps, then he must be an\r\nunquiet man with an evil conscience.\r\n\r\nOnly a little section of the road runs through the Transvaal. The\r\npractical road has indeed been diverted at De Aar in Cape Colony,\r\nand in the shape of a railway runs to Rhodesia and the neighbourhood\r\nof the Victoria Falls. But to the pilgrim this is a palpable\r\nsubterfuge, for the straight highway goes through the Transvaal,\r\ntaking the form of a railway as far as Pietersburg, and then\r\nbecoming the Bulawayo coach-road for some eighty miles, till it\r\nplunges sheer into the bush as a hunter's road and makes for Main\r\nDrift on the Limpopo. It is a type of the vicissitudes which the\r\nGreat Road is made to suffer,--railway, admitted highroad, hunter's\r\npath, native track, no road, and then a chain of waterways till it\r\nbecomes a river, and meets the railway again after 3000 miles of\r\nobscurity. With a profound respect for the road, I am constrained to\r\nadmit that it makes bad going, that it is insufficiently provided\r\nwith water, that there are no signposts or inns or, for the matter\r\nof that, white habitations, that lions do the survey work and wild\r\npigs the engineering, and that it is apt to cease suddenly and leave\r\nthe traveller to his own devices. But for the eye of Faith, that\r\nwonderful possession of raw youth and wise old age, it is as broad\r\nand solid as the Appian Way; the wheels of empire and commerce pass\r\nover it, and cities, fairer than a mirage, seem to rise along its\r\nshadowy course.\r\n\r\nOur starting-point was the Repatriation depot at Pietersburg, a large\r\nwhite-walled enclosure, with row upon row of stables and sheds and\r\nin the centre a cluster of thatched white dwelling-houses. It has the\r\nair of an Eastern caravanserai, for convoys come in and go out all\r\nday long, and the news of the Road is brought there by every manner\r\nof traveller. Apart from Government work with its endless trains of\r\nox and mule waggons, it is the starting-place for all sorts of\r\nprospecting and hunting parties, and farmers from seventy miles round\r\nride in for stock or supplies. If a lion is killed or gold found or a\r\nman lost anywhere in the north, word will be brought in to the depot\r\nby some Dutch conductor, so that the place is far better supplied\r\nwith news of true interest than your town with its dozen newspapers.\r\nFor the essence of news is that it should be vital to one's daily\r\ninterests, and tidings of a massacre in China is less stimulating to\r\nthe mind than word of a neighbour's windfall or disaster. I can\r\nconceive no more fascinating life than to dwell comfortably on the\r\nedge of a savage country from which in the way of one's business all\r\nnews comes first to one's ears. To control transport is to be the\r\ntutelary genius of travel, and in a sense the life of the wilds takes\r\nits origin from the little caravanserai which sends forth and\r\nwelcomes the traveller.\r\n\r\nThe high veld continues for some thirty miles north of the town\r\nbefore it sinks into bush and a humbler elevation. It is ordinary\r\nhigh veld--bleak, dusty, and in August a sombre grey; but on the\r\neast the blue lines, which are the Wood Bush and the Spelonken\r\nmountains, and in the far west the thin hills about the Magalakween\r\nvalley, remind the traveller how near he is to the edge of the\r\ncentral plateau. Ten miles out a crest was reached, and we looked\r\ndown on a long slope, with high mountains making gates in the\r\ndistance, and a sharp little hill called Spitzkop set in the\r\nforeground. It was a cool hazy day, and in the west the kopjes\r\nseemed to swim in an illimitable sea of blue. The land is all part\r\nof Malietsie's location, and patches of tillage and an occasional\r\ncluster of huts gave it a habitable air. The native girls wear thick\r\nrings of brass round their necks, which gives them a straight figure\r\nand a high carriage of the head, pleasant to see in a place where\r\npeople slouch habitually. Malietsie's is one of those Basuto tribes\r\nwhich are scattered over the North Transvaal--not the best type of\r\nnative, for they are credulous and idle in their raw state, and when\r\nChristianised and dwelling near mission-stations, incorrigibly lazy\r\nand deceitful. They are also inordinately superstitious. I found\r\nthat no one of my boys, who were mostly from Malietsie's, would stir\r\nten yards beyond the camp after dark. At first I thought the reason\r\nwas dread of wild beasts, but I discovered afterwards that it was\r\nfear of spooks, particularly of one spook who rolled along the road\r\nin the shape of a ball of fire. It is a tribute to the greatness of\r\nthe North Road that it should have a respectable ghost of its own. In\r\na little we passed the last store, kept by an old Scotsman, who gave\r\nus much information about the district. He talked of the Road, the\r\nRiver, and the Mountain, without further designation, which is a\r\npleasing habit of country folk, who give the generic name to the\r\ninstances which dominate their daily life. The Limpopo was the River,\r\nthe Zoutpansberg the Mountain, because no other river or mountain had\r\na local importance comparable with these, just as to a Highland\r\ngillie his own particular ben is \"the hill,\" just as to Egypt the\r\nNile is not the Nile but \"the River.\" He measured distance, too, by\r\nthe Road: this place was so many miles down the road, that water-hole\r\nso many days' journey up.\r\n\r\nWe inspanned again in the evening, and in a little turned the flanks\r\nof Spitzkop, and coming over a little rise saw a wide plain before us\r\ndensely covered with dwarf trees. The long line of the Zoutpansberg\r\ncomes to an abrupt end in a cliff above the Zoutpan. On the west the\r\nhuge mass of the Blaauwberg also breaks off sharply in tiers of fine\r\nprecipices. Between the two is a level, from fifteen to twenty miles\r\nwide, which is the pass from the high veld to the north. It is a broad\r\ngate, but the only one, for to the east the Zoutpansberg is impassable\r\nfor a hundred miles, and on the west beyond the Blaauwberg the\r\nMagalakween valley is a long circuit and a difficult country. The\r\ngreat mountain walls were dim with twilight, but there was day enough\r\nleft to see the immediate environs of the road. They had a comical\r\nsuggestion of a dilapidated English park. The road was fine gravel,\r\nthe trees in the half light looked often like gnarled oaks and\r\nbeeches, and the coarse bush grass seemed like neglected turf. It is a\r\nresemblance which dogs one through the bush veld. You are always\r\ncoming to the House and never arriving. At every turn you expect a\r\nlawn, a gleam of water, a grey wall; soon, surely, the edges will be\r\nclipped, the sand will cease, the dull green will give place to the\r\ntender green of watered grass. But the House remains to be found,\r\nthough I have a fancy that it may exist on a spur of Ruwenzori. As it\r\nwas, we had to put up with a tent and a dinner of curried korhaan, and\r\nduring the better part of a very cold night some jackals performed a\r\nstrenuous serenade.\r\n\r\nThe next morning dawned clear and very chilly, the mountains smoking\r\nwith mist, and the dust behind our waggons rising to heaven in\r\nsharply outlined columns. However cold and comfortless the night,\r\nhowever badly the limbs ache from sleeping on hard ground, there is\r\nsomething in the tonic mornings which in an hour or so dispels every\r\nfeeling but exhilaration. Water-holes have been made for the\r\npost-cart at lengthy intervals, but between there is nothing but rank\r\nbush, with flat trees like the vegetation in a child's drawing\r\nproduced by rubbing the pencil across the paper. Animal life was rich\r\nalong the road--numerous small buck, a belated jackal or two, the\r\ngraceful black-and-white birds which country people call \"Kaffir\r\nqueens,\" korhaan, guinea-fowl, partridge, quantities of bush crows,\r\nand an endless variety of hawk and falcon. We left the Road and made\r\na long detour over sandy tracks to visit the Zoutpan, from which the\r\nhills get their name, the most famous of Transvaal salt-pans. It is\r\nabout three miles in circumference, and consisted at this season of\r\ncaked grey mud, with little water-trenches and heaps of white salt on\r\ntheir banks. A wise law of the late Government forbade the alienation\r\nof salt-pans, but for some unknown reason a concession was given over\r\nthis one, and instead of being the perquisite in winter of the _arme\r\nBoeren_ it is managed by a Pietersburg syndicate, and as far as I\r\ncould judge managed very well. The work is done by natives from the\r\nmountains who live round a little stream which flows from the berg to\r\nthe pan, and forms the only fresh water for miles. The day became\r\nvery hot, and the glare from the pan was blinding to unaccustomed\r\neyes. As we returned to the main road, the noble mass of the\r\nBlaauwberg was before us, one of the finest and least known of South\r\nAfrican mountains. That curious fiasco, the Malapoch war, was fought\r\nthere, and Malapoch's people still live in its corries. To a\r\nrock-climber it is a fascinating picture, with sheer rock walls\r\nstreaked with fissures which a glass shows to be chimneys, and I\r\nlonged to be able to spend a week exploring its precipices. To a\r\nmountaineer South Africa offers many attractions, for apart from what\r\nmay be found in isolated ranges, there are some hundreds of miles of\r\nthe Drakensberg with thousands of good climbs, and above all the\r\ngreat north-eastern buttress of Mont aux Sources, which to the best\r\nof my knowledge has never been conquered.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the country changed, the bush opened out, timber\r\ntrees took the place of thorn, and long glades appeared of good winter\r\npasture. There was a great abundance of game, and for the first time\r\nthe paauw appeared, stalking about or slowly flapping across the\r\ngrass. He is a fine bird to shoot with the rifle, but a hard fellow\r\nfor a gun, for it is difficult to get within close range; and as a\r\nrule at anything over thirty yards he will carry all the shot you care\r\nto give him. This park-land lasts for about ten miles, and then at\r\nBrak River it ends and a dense thorn scrub begins, which extends\r\nalmost without interruption to the Limpopo. There we found our relays\r\nof mules, and on a dusty patch near the mule-scherm we outspanned for\r\nthe night. We were nearing the country of big game. A lion had been\r\nseen on the Bulawayo road the day before, a little north of the\r\nstation; and it was a common enough thing to have them reconnoitring\r\nthe scherm. As soon as darkness fell the cry of wolves began, that\r\ncurious unearthly wail which is one of the eeriest of veld sounds.\r\nMost forcible reminder of all, a hunting party ahead of us had lost a\r\nman, who, after wandering for six days in the bush, while his\r\ncompanions gave him up for dead, had come out on the Road and been\r\nfound by the man in charge of our relays. It was a miracle that he\r\nhad not lost his reason or perished of thirst and fatigue, for he had\r\nneither food nor water with him, and only a little cloth cap to keep\r\noff the tropical sun. An old Boer from Louis Trichard, trekking with\r\noxen, camped beside us; and after dining delicately off guinea-fowl I\r\nwent over to his fire to talk to him. He was a typical back-veld\r\nBoer--a great hunter, friendly, without any sort of dignity, a true\r\nfrontier man, to whom politics mean nothing and his next meal\r\neverything. He told me amazing lion stories, in which he always gave\r\nthe _coup de grace_, and displayed incredible courage and skill. He\r\nshowed me with pride a .400 express bullet which he kept wrapt up in\r\npaper--whether as a charm or a souvenir I do not know, for his own\r\nweapon was an ancient Martini. His one political prejudice concerned\r\nthe Jews, whose character he outlined to me with great spirit. They\r\nwere the opposite of everything implied in the term \"oprecht\"; but I\r\nam inclined to believe that, like many of us, he secretly believed\r\nthat all foreigners were Jews, and in hugging the prejudice showed\r\nhimself a nationalist at heart.\r\n\r\nThe coach-road runs due north to Tuli and Bulawayo, but the Road itself\r\ntakes a slight bend to the east and follows the course of the mythical\r\nBrak River. For miles this stream does not exist--there is not even the\r\nslightest suggestion of a bed; and then appears a dirty hole full of\r\ngreenish, brackish water, and we hail the resurrected river. It is\r\nnecessary for the traveller to know where such holes lie, for they are\r\nthe only water in the neighbourhood; and though the Road keeps close to\r\nthem, there is nothing in the dense thorn bush which lines its sides to\r\nreveal the presence of water. I have never seen bleaker bush-land. All\r\nday long, through hanging clouds of dust, we crept through the\r\nfeatureless country, the Zoutpansberg and Blaauwberg behind us growing\r\nhourly fainter. For the information of travellers, I would say that the\r\nfirst water is at a place called Krokodilgat, the second at a place\r\ncalled Rietgaten, and that after that the Road bends northward away\r\nfrom the river, and there is no water till Taqui is reached. The dust\r\nof the track was thick with the spoor of wild cats, wolves, the blue\r\nwildebeest, and at rare intervals of wild ostrich. As night fell the\r\nbush became very dead and silent, save for the far-away howl of a\r\njackal,--a dull olive-green ocean under a wonderful turquoise sky. We\r\nencamped after dark in a little wayside hollow, where we built a large\r\nfire and a massive scherm or enclosure of thorns for the animals. There\r\nwas every chance of a lion, so I retired to rest with pleasant\r\nanticipations and a quantity of loaded firearms near my head. But no\r\nlion came, though about two o'clock in the morning the mules grew very\r\nrestless, and a majestic figure (which was indeed no other than the\r\npresent writer's), armed with a .400 express, might have been seen\r\nclambering about the top of the waggon and straining sleepy eyes into\r\nthe bush.\r\n\r\nWe started at dawn next morning, as we had a long journey before\r\nwater. The thorn bush disappeared and gave place to a more open\r\ncountry, full of a kind of wormwood which gave an aromatic flavour to\r\nthe fresh morning air. Then came a new kind of bush, the mopani, a\r\nwholesome green little shrub, with butterfly-shaped foliage. The\r\nleaves of this tree would appear to be for the healing of the nations,\r\nfor a decoction of them is regarded both as a preventive against and a\r\ncure for malaria; and a mopani poultice is a sovereign cure for\r\nbruises. Among the spoor on the track was that of a large lion going\r\ntowards Taqui. There were also to our surprise the spoor and\r\ndroppings of oxen. When about eleven o'clock we reached the large pits\r\nof whitey-blue brackish water which bear that name, we found the\r\nreason of both. A shooting party encamped there had had their cattle\r\nstampeded in the night, and early in the morning a Dutch hunter who\r\naccompanied them had gone out to look for them, and found an ox\r\nfreshly killed by a lion not a quarter of a mile from the camp. He\r\nfollowed the lion, and wounded him with a long-range shot. When we\r\narrived the search for the lion had begun, and he was found stone-dead\r\na little way on, with his belly distended with ox-flesh and the bullet\r\nin his lungs. He was a very large lion, measuring about ten and a-half\r\nfeet from tip to tip, rather old, and with broken porcupine-quills\r\nembedded in his skin. A trap-gun was set, and two nights later a very\r\nfine young black-maned lion, about the same size, was found dead a\r\nhundred yards from the trap, with a broken shoulder and a bullet in\r\nhis spine. The remainder of the story shows the Providence which\r\nwatches over foolish oxen. All were recovered save one, which died of\r\nred-water. They went straight back the road they had come; and though\r\nthe country-side was infested with lions, wolves, and tiger-cats, they\r\nreached the mule-scherm at Brak River in safety.\r\n\r\nFrom Taqui the road climbs a chain of kopjes where it is almost\r\noverarched with trees, so that a covered waggon has difficulty in\r\ngetting through. From the summit there is a long prospect of flat bush\r\ncountry running to the Limpopo, with a bold ridge of hills on the\r\nRhodesian side, and far to the east the faint line of mountains which\r\nis the continuation of the Zoutpansberg to the Portuguese border. The\r\nbush was dotted with huge baobabs, the cream-of-tartar trees which so\r\nimpressed the voortrekkers in Lydenburg. At this season the branches\r\nwere leafless, but a good deal of fruit remained, which our native\r\nboys eagerly gathered and munched for the rest of the journey. The\r\nfruit has a hard shell, and is filled with little white kernels like\r\nthe sweetmeat called Turkish Delight. They have a faint sub-acid\r\nflavour, but otherwise are rather insipid. Their properties are highly\r\nsalutary, and they are used to purify bad water and to keep the\r\nhunters' blood clean in the absence of vegetable food. Their enormous\r\ntrunks, often forty feet in circumference, are not wood but a sort of\r\nfibrous substance, so that a solid rifle bullet fired from short range\r\nwill go through them. The baobab is indeed less a tree than a gigantic\r\nand salutary fungus; but in a distant prospect of landscape it has the\r\nscenic effect of large timber. An old Boer in the hunting party we had\r\npassed had given us an estimate of the distance to the next water;\r\nbut, as it turned out, he was hopelessly wrong. It is nearly\r\nimpossible to get a proper calculation of distance from country-people\r\nin South Africa. They are accustomed to calculate in hours, which of\r\ncourse vary in every district according to the nature of the road and\r\nthe quality of the transport. Six miles an hour is the usual\r\nallowance; but when a Dutchman tries to calculate in miles he gets\r\nwildly out of his bearings. The hours method still sticks in their\r\nmind; and one man solemnly informed us that a certain place was six\r\nmiles off for horses and ten for mules.\r\n\r\nWe outspanned for the night without water, and with the accompaniment\r\nof scherm and camp fires. Next morning we came suddenly out of the\r\nbush to a perfect English dell, where a little clear stream, the\r\nfirst running water we had seen, flowed out of a reed-bed into a rock\r\npool. There were a few large trees and quantities of a kind of small\r\npalm. Under the doubtful shade of a baobab we breakfasted, and then\r\nwent up the stream with our rifles to look for game. There was the\r\nusual superfluity of birds, but we saw no big game except a few\r\nbush-hogs. The stream ceased as suddenly as it began, and we followed\r\nup a dry sandy bed all but overgrown with a thorn thicket. A mile or\r\nso up we came on another pool, which was evidently the drinking-place\r\nof the bush, for the edges were trodden with the spoor of pig and\r\nmonkey and a few large buck. Pig drink during the day, but the large\r\ngame come to the water early in the morning or very late in the\r\nevening, and in the heat of mid-day go many miles into the bush. It\r\nwas a hot business ploughing along in the deep sand, and I was very\r\nglad to return to the rock-pool and a bath on a cool slab of stone.\r\nIt is a good bush-veld rule to follow the advice of Mr Jorrocks and\r\nsleep where you eat, and in the shade of the waggon we dozed till the\r\ncooler afternoon. The evening trek was in the old thorn-country,\r\nperfectly featureless, silent, and uninhabited. Since Malietsie's\r\nlocation we had seen no Kaffirs except our own and the post-runners,\r\nand we were told that this whole tract of land is almost without\r\nnatives. Even the water-holes, some of which are large and permanent,\r\nhave failed to attract inhabitants. I am reminded of a story which\r\nhas no application, but is worth recording. It was told to a burgher\r\ncamp official by an old and deeply religious Boer, who was greatly\r\npained at the experience. He fell asleep, he said, one night and\r\ndreamed; and, lo and behold, he was dead and at the gates of\r\nParadise. An affable angel met him and conducted him to a place\r\nwhere people were playing games and laughing loudly, and were\r\ngenerally consumed with energy and high spirits. \"This,\" said his\r\nguide, \"is the Rooinek heaven.\" \"No place for me,\" said the dreamer;\r\n\"these folk do not keep the Sabbath, and their noise wearies me.\"\r\nThen he came to another place where there was much beer and tobacco,\r\nand roysterers were swilling from long mugs and smoking deep-bowled\r\npipes to the strains of a brass band. \"Again this intolerable row,\"\r\nsaid my friend, \"though the tobacco looks good--clearly the German\r\nparadise.\" The next place they came to was a town where thin-faced\r\nmen were running about buying and selling and screeching market\r\nquotations. My friend would not at first believe that this was\r\nParadise at all, but his informant said it was the corner reserved\r\nfor virtuous Americans. \"Take me as soon as possible to the paradise\r\nof my own folk,\" said the dreamer; \"I am tired of these uitlander\r\nheavens.\" And then it seemed to him he was taken to a very beautiful\r\ncountry place, with rich green veld, seamed with water-furrows, and\r\nhuge orchards of peaches and nartjes, and pleasant little houses with\r\nbroad stoeps. The soul of my friend was ravished at the sight.\r\nClearly, he thought, the Boers are God's chosen folk, and he was\r\nabout to select his farm when a thought struck him. \"But where are\r\nall our people?\" he asked. \"Alas!\" said the affable angel, dropping a\r\ntear, \"it pains me to tell you that they are all in the Other Place.\"\r\n\r\nOur evening outspan was below the kopjes where the copper mines lie,\r\nand a few tracks in the veld and an empty tin or two gave warning of\r\nhuman habitation. These copper mines, which are about to be thoroughly\r\nexploited by Johannesburg companies, are old Kaffir workings, and,\r\npossibly, from some of the remains, Phoenician. The scenery suddenly\r\nbecame very peculiar,--English park-land, but with a tint of green\r\nwhich I have never seen before, a kind of dull metallic shade like some\r\nmineral dye. There were avenues of tolerably high trees, and a sort of\r\nnatural hedgerow. The grass was short and rich, and but for the odd hue\r\nnot unlike a home meadow. There were also a number of wood-pigeons of\r\nthe same metallic green, so that the whole place was a symphony in a\r\nnot very pleasing colour. Early next morning, leaving our transport\r\nbehind, we set off for the Limpopo, which is about eight miles off. The\r\nthorn thickets appeared again, and the heat as we descended into the\r\nvalley became oppressive. The altitude of the river is about 1500 feet,\r\nwhich is a descent of nearly 3000 feet from the high veld, and even in\r\nwinter time the heat is considerable, for the soil is a fine sand, and\r\nno breeze penetrates to the wooded valley. I had seen the Limpopo a\r\nwild torrent in the passes of the Magaliesberg, and I had seen it a\r\nbroad navigable river at its mouth; so I was scarcely prepared for the\r\nbed of dazzling white sand which here represented the stream. Main\r\nDrift is about a quarter of a mile wide, with a bed of bulrushes in the\r\ncentre, and except for a thin trickle close to the Rhodesian shore it\r\nis as dry as the Egyptian desert. But twelve miles higher up it is a\r\nfull stream with rapids and falls, crocodile and hippo, and some miles\r\ndown it is a stagnant tropical lagoon. The water is there, but buried\r\nbelow Heaven knows how many feet of rock and sand. Those mysterious\r\nAfrican rivers which disappear and return after many miles have a\r\nfascination for the mind which cares for the inexplicable. The valley\r\nis there, the bulrushes, the shingle, the water-birds, but no\r\nriver--only a ribbon of white sand, or a few dusty holes in the rock.\r\nAnd then without warning, as the traveller stumbles down the valley,\r\nwater rises before him like a mirage, and instead of a desert he has a\r\nriver-side. There is little kinship between the torrent which rushes\r\nthrough Crocodile Poort and this arid hollow, but the great river never\r\nloses itself, and though it is foiled and swamped and strained through\r\nsand it succeeds in the end, like Oxus in the poem, in collecting all\r\nits waters, and pours a stately flood through the low coast-lands to\r\nthe ocean. Ploughing about in the dry bed under the tropical noontide\r\nsun was dreary work, and put us very much in the position of Mr Pliable\r\nin the Slough of Despond, when he cried, \"May I get out again with my\r\nlife, you shall possess the brave country alone for me.\" We saw a\r\nnumber of spur-winged geese, which for some reason the Boers call wild\r\nMuscovy, and a heron or two sailing down the blue. A little up stream\r\nthere was a lagoon in the sand flanked on one side by rocks--a clear\r\ndeep pool, where a man might bathe without fear of strange beasts.\r\nWallowing in the lukewarm water, the glare exceeded anything I have\r\nknown--blue water, white rock, and acres and acres of white sand\r\nbetween hot copper-coloured hills.\r\n\r\nAs we left the river we said farewell to the Road. It showed itself on\r\nthe Rhodesian side climbing a knoll past a cluster of huts which had\r\nonce been a police station, but had been relinquished because of the\r\ngreat mortality from fever. Thereafter it was lost among bush and a\r\nchain of broken hills. It cared nothing for appearances, being sandy\r\nand overgrown and in places scarcely a track at all, for it had a\r\nweary way to go before it could be called a civilised road again.\r\nThere was something purposeful and gallant in the little trail\r\nplunging into the wilds, and with regret we took our last look of it\r\nand turned our faces southwards.\r\n\r\nOur way back lay mostly through dense bush-land, and in the days of\r\nhunting and the evenings round the fire I saw much of the life and\r\nrealised something of the fascination of this strange form of country.\r\nIt has no obvious picturesqueness, this interminable desert of thorn\r\nand sand and rank grass, varied at rare intervals by a raw kopje or a\r\nclump of timber. The sun beats on it at mid-day with pitiless force,\r\nand if it was hot in the month of August, what must it be at midsummer?\r\nThe rivers are sand-filled ditches, and the infrequent water is found\r\ncommonly in brack lagoons; but, dry as it is, it has none of the\r\nwholesomeness of most arid countries, generally forming a hotbed of\r\nfever. An aneroid which I carried to give a flavour of science to our\r\nexpedition, put its average elevation at between 1500 and 2000 feet.\r\nAgriculture is everywhere impossible, though some of the better\r\ntimbered parts might make good winter ranching country. But, apart from\r\npossible mineral exploitation, the land must remain hunting veld, and\r\nindeed is favourably placed for a large-game preserve. The very\r\nscarcity of water makes it a suitable dwelling-place for the larger\r\nbuck, who drink but once a-day; and the difficulty of penetrating such\r\na desert will be an effective agent in preservation. A man walking\r\nthrough it sees nothing for days beyond the dead green of thorn bush,\r\ntill he comes to some slight ridge and overlooks a round horizon, a\r\nplain flat as mid-ocean, crisped with the same monotonous dwarf trees.\r\nHidden away round water-holes there are glades and drives with a faint\r\nhint of that softness which to us is inseparable from woodland scenery,\r\nbut they are so few that they only increase by contrast the sense of\r\nhard desolation. The bush is very silent. Its dwellers make no noise as\r\nthey move about, till evening brings the cries of beasts of prey. The\r\nnights in winter are intensely cold, with a sharpness which I found\r\nmore difficult to endure than the honest frost of the high veld. The\r\nnoons are dusty and torrid, and the thirst of the bush is a thing not\r\neasily coped with. But in three phases this desert took on a curious\r\ncharm. That South African landscape must be bleak indeed which is not\r\ntransformed by the mornings and evenings. For two hours after sunrise a\r\nchill hangs in the air, light fresh winds blow from nowhere, and the\r\nscrub which is so dead and ugly at mid-day assumes clear colours and\r\nstands out olive-green and rich umber against the pale sky. At twilight\r\nthe wonderful amethyst haze turns everything to fairyland, the track\r\nshimmers among purple shadows, and every little gap in the bush is\r\nmagnified to a glade in a forest. I have also a very vivid memory of a\r\nview from one of the small ridges in full moonlight. It was like\r\nlooking from a hill-top on a vast virgin forest, a dark symmetrical\r\nocean of tree-tops with a glimpse of ivory from an open space where the\r\nroad emerged for a moment from the covert.\r\n\r\nThere is little danger in hunting here unless you are happy enough to\r\nmeet a lion and so unfortunate as not to kill with the first shot. But\r\nit is very arduous and hot, the clothes become pincushions of thorns,\r\nface and hands are scratched violently with swinging boughs, and a\r\nman's temper is apt to get brittle at times. In thick bush one can\r\nonly hunt by spoor, and it is a slow business with a grilling sun on\r\none's back and a few obtuse native boys. The native is usually a good\r\ntracker, but he is an unsatisfactory colleague because of the\r\ndifficulty of communicating with him. For one thing, even in a\r\nlanguage which he understands, he does not seem to know the meaning of\r\nthe note of interrogation. If he is asked if a certain mark is a black\r\nwildebeest's spoor, he imagines that his master asserts that such is\r\nthe case, and politely hastens to agree with him, whereas he knows\r\nperfectly well that it is not, and if he understood that he was being\r\nasked for information, would give it willingly. The difficulty, too,\r\nof hunting by a kind of rude instinct is that when this instinct is at\r\nfault he is left utterly helpless, and has no notion of any sort of\r\ndeductive reasoning. If a native is once lost he is thoroughly lost,\r\nthough his knowledge of the country may enable him to keep alive when\r\na white man would die. I found also that my boys had so many errands\r\nof their own to do in the bush that it was difficult to keep them to\r\ntheir work. They scrambled for baobab fruit; they hunted for wolves'\r\nand lions' dung, from which they make an ointment, smeared with which\r\nthey imagine they can safely walk through the bush at all seasons. The\r\nsupreme danger of this kind of life is undoubtedly to be lost away\r\nfrom water and tracks. It is a misfortune which any man may suffer,\r\nbut for any one with some experience of savage country, who takes his\r\nbearings carefully at the start and never gets out of touch with them,\r\nthe danger is very small. In this country there is always some\r\nlandmark--a kopje, a big tree, and in some parts the distant ranges of\r\nmountains--by which, with the sun and some knowledge of the lie of the\r\nland, one can safely travel many miles from the camp. For a man on a\r\ngood horse there is no excuse, here at any rate, for losing himself;\r\nfor a man on foot heat and fatigue and the closeness of the bush may\r\nwell drive all calculations out of his head. Apart from other\r\nterrors, a night in those wilds is likely to be disturbed from the\r\nattentions of beasts of prey, and a man who has not the means of\r\nmaking a scherm or a fire will have to spend a restless night in a\r\ntree. To be finally and hopelessly lost is the most awful fate which I\r\ncan imagine. It is easy to conjure up the details, and many uneasy\r\nnights I have spent in such dismal forecasts. First, the annoyance,\r\nthe hasty pushing through the scrub, believing the camp to be just in\r\nfront, and lamenting that you are late for dinner. Then the slow\r\nfatigue, the slow consciousness that the camp is not there, that you\r\ndo not know where you are, and that you must make the best of the\r\nnight in the open. Morning comes, and confidently you try to take your\r\nbearings; by this time others are seeking you, you reflect, and with a\r\nlittle care you can find your whereabouts and go to meet them. Then a\r\nlong hot day, without water or food, pushing eternally through the\r\ndull green scrub, every moment leaving confidence a little weaker,\r\ntill the second night comes, and you doze uneasily in a horror of\r\nnightmare and physical illness. Then the spectral awaking, the\r\nwatching of a giddy sunrise, the slow forcing of the body to the same\r\nhopeless quest, till the thorns begin to dance before you and the\r\nblack froth comes to the lips, and in a little reason takes wing, and\r\nyou die crazily by inches in the parched silence.\r\n\r\nI have said that the bush is without human inhabitants, but every now\r\nand then we found traces of other travellers. A dusty pack-donkey\r\nwould suddenly emerge from the thicket, followed by two dusty and\r\nsunburnt men, each with some prehistoric kind of gun. Sometimes we\r\nbreakfasted with this kind of party, and heard from them the curious\r\ntale of their wanderings. They would ask us the news, having seen no\r\nwhite man for half a-year, and it was odd to see the voracity with\r\nwhich they devoured the very belated papers we could offer them. They\r\nhad been east to the Portuguese border and west to Bechuanaland and\r\nnorth to the Zambesi, pursuing one of the hardest and most thankless\r\ntasks on earth. The prospector skirmishes ahead of civilisation. On\r\nhis labours great industries are based, but he himself gets, as a\r\nrule, little reward. Fever and starvation are incidents of his daily\r\nlife, and yet there is a certain relish in it for the old stager, and\r\nI doubt if he would be content to try an easier job which curtailed\r\nhis freedom. For, if you think of it, there is an undercurrent of\r\nperpetual excitement in the life, which is treasure-hunting made a\r\nbusiness: any morning may reveal the great reef or the rich pipe, and\r\nchange this dusty fellow with his tired mules into a nabob. Among the\r\ntaciturn men who crept out of the bush every type was represented,\r\nfrom Australian cow-punchers to well-born gentlemen from home, whose\r\nnames were still on the lists of good clubs. One party I especially\r\nremember, three huge Canadians, who came in the darkness and encamped\r\nby our fire. They had a ramshackle cart and two mules, and the whole\r\noutfit was valeted by the very smallest nigger-boy you can imagine. It\r\ndid one good to see the way in which that child sprang to attention at\r\nsunrise, and, clad simply in a gigantic pair of khaki trousers and one\r\nside of an old waistcoat, lit the fire, made coffee for his three\r\nmasters, cooked breakfast, caught and harnessed the mules, and was\r\nsquatting in the cart, all within the shortest possible time. The\r\nCanadians had been all over the world and in every profession, but of\r\nall trades they liked the late war best, and made anxious inquiries\r\nabout Somaliland. They were the true adventurer type,--long, thin,\r\nhollow-eyed, tough as whipcord, men who, like the Black Douglas, would\r\nrather hear the lark sing than the mouse cheep. After making fierce\r\ninroads on my tobacco, and giving me their views on the native\r\nquestion and many incidental matters, they departed into the Western\r\nbush, one man cracking the whip and whistling \"Annie Laurie,\" and the\r\nother two, with guns, creeping along on the flanks. I took off my hat\r\nin spirit to the advance-guard of our people, the men who know much\r\nand fear little, who are always a little ahead of everybody else in\r\nthe waste places of the earth. You can readily whistle them back to\r\nthe defence of some portion of the Empire or gather them for the\r\nmaintenance of some single frontier; but when the work is done they\r\nretire again to their own places, with their eyes steadfastly to the\r\nwilds but their ears always open for the whistle to call them back\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n_August 1903._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF SOUTH AFRICAN SPORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great days of South African sport are over, and there is no\r\ndisguising the fact. Open any early record, such as Oswell or\r\nGordon-Cumming, and the size and variety of the bag dazzles the mind\r\nof the amateur of to-day. Then it was possible to shoot lion in Cape\r\nColony and elephant in the Transvaal, and to find at one's door game\r\nwhose only habitat is now some narrow region near the Mountains of the\r\nMoon. Turn even to the later pages of Mr Selous, and anywhere north of\r\na line drawn east and west through Pretoria, there was such sport to\r\nbe had as can now be found with difficulty on the Zambesi. The absence\r\nof game laws and the presence of many bold hunters have cleared the\r\nveld of the vast herds of antelope which provided the voortrekker with\r\nfresh meat, and the advance of industry and settlement have driven\r\npredatory animals still farther afield. From the Zambesi southward ten\r\nor twelve species of antelope may still be found in fair numbers, but\r\nthe nobler and larger kinds of game, the giraffe, the koodoo, the\r\nblack wildebeest, the two hartebeests, and the eland, are scarce save\r\nin a few remote valleys. The white rhinoceros is almost extinct and\r\nthe ordinary kind uncommon. The hippopotamus, which is not a sporting\r\nanimal, is still found in most tropical rivers; wild pigs--both\r\nbush-hog and wart-hog--are plentiful in the northern bush; but the\r\ngraceful zebra is rapidly disappearing. Lion are still fairly easy to\r\ncome on unawares anywhere north of the Limpopo, and in the mountains\r\nand flats of the north-eastern Transvaal. A few troops of elephant may\r\nexist unpreserved in the region between the Pungwe and the Zambesi, a\r\nfew in Northern Mashonaland, with perhaps one or two in the Northern\r\nKalahari. The war, on the whole, has been on the side of the wild\r\nanimals, for though large herds of springbok and blesbok were\r\nslaughtered by the troops on the high veld, the native, that\r\ninveterate poacher, has been restrained from his evil ways by\r\nlucrative military employment, so that the northern districts are\r\nbetter stocked to-day than they were five years ago. But the fact\r\nremains that South Africa is no longer virgin hunting-veld. The game\r\nis disappearing, and, unless every care is taken, will in a few years\r\ngo the way of the American buffalo. If we are to preserve for South\r\nAfrica its oldest inhabitants, and keep it as a hunting-ground for the\r\ntrue sportsman, we must bestir ourselves and act promptly. In this, as\r\nin graver questions, an intelligent forethought must take the place of\r\nthe old slackness.\r\n\r\nSuch a policy must take two forms,--the establishment of good laws for\r\nthe preservation of game and the regulation of sport, and the formation\r\nof game-reserves. The best course would have been to declare a rigid\r\nclose time for five years, during which no game other than birds and\r\ndestructive animals should be killed, save in the case of damage to\r\ncrops. The administrative difficulties, however, in the way of such a\r\nheroic remedy were very great, and the code of game laws, now in force\r\nin the Transvaal, seems to mark the limit of possible restriction.\r\nUnder these power is given to declare a close season--a valuable\r\ndiscretionary power, since the season varies widely for different kinds\r\nof game--during which no game may be killed, and also to preserve\r\nabsolutely any specified bird or animal in any specified district up to\r\na period of three years. This would permit the absolute preservation of\r\nsuch animals as the springbok and the blesbok in certain parts of the\r\ncountry where they are scarce, without interfering with sport in other\r\nlocalities where they are plentiful. The ordinary shooting licence for\r\nbirds and antelope is fixed at L3 for the season; but certain rarer\r\nanimals have been made special game, and to hunt these permission must\r\nbe obtained in writing from the Colonial Secretary and a fee paid of\r\nL25. The chief of these are the elephant, hippo, rhinoceros, buffalo;\r\nthe quagga and the zebra; the two hartebeests, the two wildebeests, the\r\nroan and the sable antelope, the koodoo, eland, giraffe, and tsessabe.\r\nThe wild ostrich and that beautiful bird the mahem or crested crane\r\n(_Chrysopelargus balearica_) are also included. Provision is made\r\nagainst the sale or destruction of the eggs of game-birds and the sale\r\nof dead game in the close season. Under this law the ordinary man, on\r\nthe payment of a small sum, has during the season the right to shoot\r\nover thirty varieties of game-birds and over a dozen kinds of buck, as\r\nwell as wild pig and lion and tiger-cats, if he is fortunate enough to\r\nfind them, on most Crown lands and on private lands when he can get the\r\nowner's permission,--a tolerably wide field for the sportsman. But\r\nrestrictive laws are not enough in themselves; it is necessary to\r\nprovide an equivalent to the sanctuary in a deer-forest, reserves\r\nwhere wild animals are immune at all seasons. The late Government\r\nestablished several nominal reserves, notably on the Lesser Sabi\r\nRiver and in the extreme eastern corner of Piet Retief which adjoins\r\nTongaland; but no proper steps were taken to enforce the reservations.\r\nThe new Government has strictly delimited the Sabi preserve and\r\nappointed a ranger; and certain adjoining land companies between the\r\nSabi and the Olifants have made similar provisions for their own land.\r\nBut one reserve in one locality is not enough. The true principle is\r\nto establish a small reserve and a sanctuary in each district. Part of\r\nthe Crown lands in Northern Rustenburg, in Waterberg, in Northern and\r\nEastern Zoutpansberg, and especially in the Springbok Flats district,\r\nmight well be formed into reserves without any real injury to such\r\nagricultural and pastoral development as they are capable of. If the\r\ngreater land companies could be induced to follow suit--and there is\r\nno reason why they should not--an effective and far-reaching system\r\nof game preservation could be put in force.[12] Finally, something\r\nmust be done at once to stop native poaching, more especially the\r\ndepredations of the wretched Kaffir dogs. Officers of constabulary,\r\nland inspectors, as well as all owners and lessees of farms, should\r\nhave the power to shoot at sight any dog trespassing on a game-preserve\r\nor detected in the pursuit of game. An increased dog-tax, too, might\r\nstop the present system of large mongrel packs which are to be seen in\r\nany Kaffir kraal. A stringent Vermin Act, which is highly necessary for\r\nthe protection of small stock like sheep and goats, would also help to\r\nprevent the slaughter of buck by wild dogs and jackals.\r\n\r\nBut for the big-game hunter, in the old African sense, there is little\r\nor nothing left. The day of small things has arisen, and we must be\r\ncontent to record tamely our sport in braces of birds and heads of\r\nsmall buck, where our grandfathers recorded theirs in lion-skins and\r\ntusks and broken limbs. Big game there still is, but they are far\r\nafield, and have to be pursued at some risk to horse and man from fly\r\nand malaria. The lion, as I have said, is still fairly common in the\r\ndistrict between Magatoland and the Limpopo, in the continuation of\r\nthe Zoutpansberg east to the Rooi Rand, down the slopes of the\r\nLebombo, and in the flats along the Lower Letaba, Olifants, and\r\nLimpopo. He is frequently met with in most parts of Rhodesia, though\r\nhis habits are highly capricious, and while a tourist one day's\r\njourney from Salisbury may see several, a man who spends six months\r\nhunting may never get a shot. Portuguese territory is still a haunt of\r\nbig game, though the natives are doing their best to exterminate it,\r\nfor the thick bush and the pestilent climate between the Lebombo and\r\nthe sea will always make hunting difficult; and the Pungwe and its\r\ntributaries still form, at the proper season, perhaps the best\r\nshooting-ground south of the Zambesi. The elephant cannot be counted a\r\nquarry; and any man who attempts to kill an elephant in South Africa\r\nto-day deserves severe treatment, save in such preserves as the Addo\r\nBush and the Knysna forest in Cape Colony, where they are rapidly\r\nbecoming a nuisance. A few head of buffalo still survive, in spite of\r\nrinderpest, in the extreme Eastern Transvaal, as well as in Portuguese\r\nterritory; and the eland, that noblest and largest of buck, is found\r\nalong the Portuguese border. Report has it that in some of the\r\nDrakensberg kloofs between Basutoland and Natal a few stray eland may\r\nalso be found. The beautiful antelopes, sable and roan, the exquisite\r\nkoodoo, the blue wildebeest and the two hartebeests, roam in small\r\nherds on the malarial eastern flats, and a few giraffe are reported\r\nfrom the same neighbourhood. The gemsbok, with his lengthy taper\r\nhorns, has long been confined to the remote parts of the Kalahari.\r\n\r\nA big-game expedition will, therefore, in a few years' time still be a\r\npossibility in Central South Africa, and with judicious management it\r\nmay long remain so, for those who can afford the time and the not\r\ninconsiderable expense. The best place must remain the country between\r\nthe Lebombo and the Drakensberg, and north from the Olifants to the\r\nLimpopo. Eastern Mashonaland, the Kalahari, and the Pungwe district\r\nwill be available for those who care to go farther afield. The venue\r\nmust be chosen according as a man proposes to hunt on horse or on foot.\r\nBoth forms of sport have their attractions. On the great open flats of\r\nthe Kalahari and Rhodesia no sport in the world can equal the pursuit\r\nof big game with a trained horse--the wild gallop, stalking, so to\r\nspeak, at racing speed, the quick dismounting and firing, the pursuit\r\nof a maimed animal, the imminent danger, perhaps, from a charging\r\nbuffalo or a wounded lion. This horseback hunting is, as a rule,\r\npursued in a healthy country, every moment is full of breathless\r\nexcitement, and success requires a steady nerve and a sure seat. But\r\nstalking on foot in thick bush makes greater demands on bodily strength\r\nand self-possession. The country is rarely wholesome, and in those\r\nblazing flats a long daylight stalk will tire the strongest. There is\r\nmore need, too, for veld-craft, and an intimate knowledge of the habits\r\nof game; and when game is found, there is more need for a clear eye and\r\na steady pulse, for a man hunting in veldschoen and a shirt is pretty\r\nwell at the mercy of a mad animal. But in both forms of sport there is\r\nthe same lonely freedom, the same wonderful earth, and the same homely\r\nand intimate comforts. No man can ever forget the return, utterly\r\ntired, in the cool dusk, which is alive with the glimmer of wings, and\r\nthe sight of the waggon-lantern and the great fire at which the boys\r\nare cooking dinner. A wash and a drink--indispensable after a hot day\r\nlest a man should overstay his appetite; and then a hunter's meal,\r\nwhich tastes as the cookery of civilisation seldom tastes. There is no\r\nreason why a hunter should not live well, far better than in any South\r\nAfrican town, for he can count on fresh meat always, and, if he is\r\nfortunate, on eggs and fish and fruit. And then the evening pipe in a\r\ndeck-chair, with the big lantern swinging from a tree, the great fire\r\nmaking weird shadows in the forest, and natives chattering drowsily\r\naround the ashes. Lastly, to an early bed in his blankets, and up again\r\nat dawn, with another day before him of this sane and wholesome life.\r\n\r\nThe chief dangers in African hunting, greater far than any from wild\r\nanimals, are the chances of malaria and the possibility of getting\r\nlost. In many trips the first may be absent, but for a keen man it is\r\noften necessary to time his expeditions when the grass is short or\r\nwhen he has a chance of having the field to himself, periods which do\r\nnot always coincide with the healthy season. It is not for anyone to\r\nventure lightly on a long hunting trek. But, granted a sound\r\nconstitution, decent carefulness in matters such as the abstinence\r\nfrom all liquids save at meals, and from alcohol save before dinner,\r\nand the rigorous use of a mosquito-curtain, can generally bring a man\r\nsafely through. The system can be fortified by small and regular doses\r\nof quinine, and the camp should be pitched, whenever possible, in some\r\ndry and open spot. These may seem foolish precautions to an old hunter\r\nwhose body has been seasoned with innumerable attacks, but it is wise\r\nfor one who has not suffered that misfortune to take every means to\r\navoid it. To be lost in the bush is an accident which every man is\r\nhorribly afraid of, and which may happen any day even to the most\r\ncautious, unless he has gone far in the curious lore of the wilds.\r\nThere are men, of course, who are beyond the fear of it, chosen\r\nspirits to whom a featureless plain is full of intricate landmarks,\r\nand the sky is a clearer chart than any map. But the common traveller\r\nmay walk a score of yards or so from the path, look round, see all\r\nabout him high waving grasses somewhere in which the road is hidden,\r\ngo off hastily in what seems the right direction, walk for a couple of\r\nhours and change his mind, and then, lo! and behold, his nerve goes\r\nand he is lost, perhaps for days, perhaps for ever. The ordinary\r\nprocedure of a hunting trip, tossing for beats in the morning and then\r\nscattering each in a different direction, gives scope for such\r\nmisfortunes. The safest plan is, of course, never to go out without a\r\ncompetent native guide; and, where this precaution is out of the\r\nquestion, the next best is to rely absolutely on some experienced\r\nmember of the party who can follow spoor, sit down once you have lost\r\nyour bearings, and wait till he finds you. A time is fixed after\r\nwhich, if a man does not return, it is presumed that he is in\r\ndifficulties, and a search party is sent out; and naturally it saves a\r\ngreat deal of trouble if a man does not confuse the searchers by\r\nconstantly going back on his tracks. If the hunter is on horseback he\r\ncan try trusting his horse, which is said--I have happily never had\r\noccasion to prove the truth of the saying--to be able on the second\r\nday to go back to its last water. The whole hunting veld is full of\r\ngruesome tales of men utterly lost or found too late; and most hunting\r\nparties in flat or thickly wooded country come back with a wholesome\r\ndread of the mischances of the bush.\r\n\r\nFor the man who has little time to spare there remain the smaller\r\nbuck. And such game is not to be lightly despised. The commonest and\r\nsmallest are the little duiker and steinbok, shy, fleet little\r\ncreatures which give many a sporting shot and make excellent eating. I\r\nsuppose there are few farms in any part of South Africa without a few\r\nof them, and in some districts they are nearly as common as hares on\r\nan English estate. The springbok, a true gazelle, is more local in his\r\noccurrence, though large herds still exist in Cape Colony and parts of\r\nthe Orange River Colony. Fair-sized herds are to be found, too, in the\r\nwestern district of the Transvaal and in certain parts of Waterberg\r\nand Ermelo. The blesbok is rather less frequent, though he used to be\r\ncommon enough, but there are numerous small herds in various parts of\r\nthe country. These four varieties are the stand-by of South African\r\nshooting: other buck are to be sought more as trophies than in the\r\nordinary way of sport. The water-buck, with his handsome head, and\r\nextremely poor venison, is common along all the sub-tropical and\r\ntropical rivers, but to shoot him requires a certain amount of\r\ntrekking. So with the reed-buck, who haunts the same localities,\r\nthough he is still found in places so close to the high veld as the\r\nsouthern parts of Marico and the Amsterdam district in the east. The\r\nbeautiful impala, with his reddish coat and delicately notched\r\nantlers, is the commonest buck in the Sabi game-preserves, and extends\r\nover most of the bush veld, as well as parts of Waterberg and a few\r\nfarms in the south-east. The klipspringer is found on all the slopes\r\nof the great eastern range of mountains, and is very common on the\r\nNatal side of the Drakensberg. He is a beautiful and difficult quarry,\r\nhaving a chamois-like love of inaccessible places, and being able to\r\ncover the most appalling ground at racing speed. The vaal rhebok and\r\nthe rooi rhebok are found in small numbers in the same localities, and\r\nthe latter is also fairly common in the wooded hills around Zeerust.\r\nBoth the bush-pig and the wart-hog are plentiful in the bush veld, and\r\non the slopes of the eastern mountains. Finally, the bush-buck, one of\r\nthe most beautiful, and, for his size, the fiercest of all buck, is\r\nwidely distributed among the woods of Cape Colony and Natal, and in\r\nthe belts of virgin forest which extend with breaks from Swaziland to\r\nZoutpansberg. Living in the dense undergrowth, he has been pretty well\r\nout of the way of the hunter who killed for the pot. He is an awkward\r\nfellow to meet at close quarters in a bad country, for, when wounded,\r\nhe will charge, and his powerful horns are not pleasant to encounter.\r\nThere have been several cases of natives, and even of white men, who\r\nhave died of wounds from his assaults. His elder brother, the inyala,\r\ndoes not, so far as I know, appear south of the Limpopo.\r\n\r\nThe favourite South African method of shooting such game as the\r\nspringbok is by driving him with an army of native beaters down wind\r\nagainst the guns. In an open country buck can be stalked on horseback\r\nor ridden down in the Dutch fashion of \"brandt.\" Elsewhere stalking on\r\nfoot is the only way, a difficult matter unless the hunter knows the\r\nhabits and haunts of the game. South African shooting seems hard at\r\nfirst to the new-comer, partly from the difficulty of judging\r\ndistances in the novel clearness of the air, partly from the shyness\r\nof game, which often makes it necessary to take shots at a range which\r\nseems ridiculous to one familiar only with Scots deer-stalking, and\r\npartly from the extraordinary tenacity of life which those wild\r\nanimals show,[13] limiting the choice of marks to a very few parts of\r\nthe body. But experience can do much, and in time any man with a clear\r\neye and good nerve may look for reasonable success. As has been noted\r\nin a former chapter, the best shots in the country, with a few\r\nexceptions, are to be found among English immigrants and Colonists of\r\nEnglish blood. It is a kind of shooting which seems incredible at\r\nfirst sight to the ordinary man from home. I have known such a hunter\r\nto put a bullet at over 100 yards through the head of a korhaan, a\r\nbird scarcely larger than a blackcock: a feat which might be set down\r\nto accident were it not that the same man was accustomed to shoot\r\nsmall buck running at 200 yards with remarkable success. I should be\r\nvery sorry to wage war against a corps of sharpshooters drawn from old\r\nAfrican hunters.\r\n\r\nThere remain the numerous game-birds of the country. The finest is, of\r\ncourse, the greater paauw, but he is not very common in the Transvaal\r\nitself, though frequent enough in Bechuanaland, Rhodesia, and some\r\nparts of the northern bush veld. But of the bustard family, to which\r\nthe comprehensive name of korhaan is applied, there are at least four\r\nvarieties, two of which are very common. The bustard is an easy bird,\r\nsave that he carries a good deal of shot, and has a knack of keeping\r\nout of range unless properly stalked or driven. The Dutch word\r\n\"patrys,\" again, covers at least eight varieties of the true\r\npartridge, and if we include the sand-grouse (called the Namaqua\r\npartridge), of two or three more. None of the South African partridge\r\ntribe are equal to their English brothers; but there is no reason why\r\nthe English bird should not be introduced, and thrive well, and indeed\r\nexperiments in this direction are being made. There are three birds\r\nwhich the Dutch call \"pheasant,\" two of them francolins and one the\r\ncurious dikkop--birds which have few of the qualities of the English\r\npheasant, but which are strong on the wing, offer fair shots, and make\r\nexcellent eating. Quail are found at certain seasons of the year in\r\nvast quantities, and give good sport with dogs; but to my mind the\r\nfinest South African bird, excepting of course the greater paauw, is\r\nthe guinea-fowl, which the Dutch call by the quaint and beautiful name\r\nof _tarentaal_. There are two varieties, fairly well distributed--the\r\nordinary crested (_Numida coronata_) and the blue-headed (_Numida\r\nEdouardi_). In parts of the bush veld they may be seen roosting at\r\nnight on trees so thickly that the branches are bent with their\r\nweight. When pursued in broken country, what with dodging among stones\r\nand trees and his short unexpected flight, the guinea-fowl offers some\r\nexcellent shooting, and as a table-bird he is not easy to beat.\r\nWildfowl are an uncertain quantity on the uplands, though very common\r\nnearer the coast. They do not come to the rivers, but, on the other\r\nhand, they frequent in great numbers farm dams and the pans and lakes\r\nof Standerton and Ermelo. What the Dutch call specifically the \"wilde\r\ngans\" is the Egyptian goose; but several other varieties, including\r\nthe spur-winged, are to be found. There are some ten kinds of duck,\r\nbut it would be difficult to say which is the commonest, as they vary\r\nin different districts. The Dutch call a bird \"teel\" which is not the\r\ntrue teal, but the variety known as the Cape teal (_Nettion capense_),\r\nthough there is more than one kind of proper teal to be met with.\r\nThere is a black duck, a variety of pochard, a variety of shoveller,\r\nand a kind of shell-duck which is known as the mountain duck\r\n(_bergeend_). Wild pigeons exist in endless quantities; and I must not\r\nomit the pretty spur-winged plover, which cries all day long on the\r\nwestern veld, or that most cosmopolitan of birds, the snipe. Along the\r\nreed-beds of the Limpopo, in the bulrushes which fringe the pans in\r\nErmelo, by every spruit and dam, you may put up precisely the same\r\nfellow that you shoot in Hebridean peat-mosses or on Swedish lakes, or\r\nalong the canals of Lower Egypt. The little brown long-billed bird has\r\nannihilated time and space and taken the whole world for his home.\r\n\r\nThere is need of some little care lest we drive the wild birds\r\naltogether away from the neighbourhood of the towns. They are still\r\nplentiful, but, if over-shot, they change their quarters; and people\r\ncomplain that whereas five years ago they could get excellent shooting\r\nwithin three miles of their door, they have now to content themselves\r\nwith a few stragglers. It is for the owners of land to see that its\r\ndenizens are properly protected, for the disappearance of big game is\r\nan awful warning not to presume on present abundance. Some day we\r\nmay hope to see the country farmer as eager to preserve his game as\r\nhe is now to destroy it. There needs but the pinch of scarcity and\r\nthe growth of a market value for shooting to turn the present\r\nfree-and-easy ways into a perhaps too rigorous protective system.\r\n\r\nThere remain two sports which are still in their infancy in the\r\ncountry and deserve serious development--the keeping of harriers and\r\nangling. I say harriers advisedly, for though it would be better to\r\nstick to drafts from foxhound packs because of the greater strength\r\nand hardiness of the hounds, yet the sport can never fairly be\r\ndignified by the name of fox-hunting. The quarries will be the hare,\r\nthe small buck, and in certain districts the jackal. The veld in parts\r\nis a fine natural hunting-ground, and the hazards, which will be\r\nwanting in the shape of hedges and banks, will exist very really in\r\nant-bear holes and dongas. As the fencing laws take effect there will\r\nbe wire to go over for those who have Australian nerves. The\r\nAfrikander pony is an animal born for the work, and once harrier packs\r\nwere established there is every reason to believe that the Dutch\r\nfarmers would join in the sport. The only two reasons I have ever\r\nheard urged against the proposal are--first, that hounds when brought\r\nout to South Africa lose their noses; and, second, that it would be\r\nhard to get a good scent in the dry air of the veld. The first is true\r\nin a sense, but only because a draft brought out from home is usually\r\nset to work at once and not acclimatised gradually to the change of\r\nair. There is no inherent impossibility in keeping a dog's nose good,\r\nas is shown by the many excellent setters and pointers that have been\r\nimported. In any case, if the master of harriers breeds carefully he\r\nought in a few years to get together a thoroughly acclimatised pack.\r\nAs for the matter of scent, there is no denying that it would not lie\r\non the ordinary hot dry day, but this only means that it will not be\r\npossible to hunt all the year round. I can imagine no better weather\r\nthan the cool moist days which are common on the high veld in autumn\r\nand early spring, and even in summer the mornings up to ten o'clock\r\nare cool enough for the purpose. South African hunts must follow the\r\nIndian fashion, and when they cannot get whole days for their sport\r\nmake the best of the early hours.\r\n\r\nFishing, I am afraid, has been in the past a neglected sport. The Boer\r\nleft it to the Kaffir, and the uitlander had better things to think\r\nabout. Had the land possessed any native fish of the type of the\r\nAmerican brook-trout or the land-locked salmon, perhaps it would have\r\nbeen different; but in the high-veld streams the only notable fish are\r\ntwo species of carp, known as yellow-fish and white-fish, which run\r\nfrom 2 lb. to 6 lb., and the barbel, which may weigh anything up to 30\r\nlb.[14] There are also eels, which may be disregarded. I do not think\r\nthese South African fish are to be despised, for though they may be\r\ndead-hearted compared with a trout or a salmon, they give better sport\r\nthan English coarse fish, and the barbel is quite as good as a pike.\r\nThe ordinary bait is mealie-meal paste, a locust or any kind of small\r\nanimal, a phantom minnow, and even a piece of bright rag. I have known\r\nboth kinds of carp take a brightly coloured sea-trout fly, and give\r\nthe angler a very good run for his pains. But the great South African\r\nfish is the tiger-fish, confined, unhappily, to sub-tropical rivers\r\nand malarial country. He is not unlike a trout in appearance, save for\r\nhis fierce head, which suggests the _Salmo ferox_. In any of the\r\neastern rivers--Limpopo, Letaba, Olifants, Sabi, Crocodile, Komati,\r\nUsutu, Umpilusi--he is the chief--indeed, so far as I could judge, the\r\nonly--fish, and he is one of the most spirited of his tribe. He will\r\nreadily take an artificial minnow, and also, I am told, a large salmon\r\nfly, but the tackle must be at least as strong as for pike, for his\r\nformidable teeth will shear through any ordinary casting line. His\r\naverage weight is perhaps about 10 lb., though he has been caught up\r\nto 30 lb., but it is not his size so much as his extraordinary\r\nfierceness and dash which makes him attractive. When hooked he leaps\r\nfrom the water like a clean salmon, and for an hour or more he may\r\nlead the perspiring fisherman as pretty a dance as he could desire. If\r\nany one is inclined to think angling a tame sport, I can recommend\r\nthis experiment. Let him go out on some river like the Komati on a\r\nstifling December day, when the sky is brass above and not a breath of\r\nair breaks the stillness, in one of the leaky and crazy cobles of\r\nthose parts. Let him hook and land a tiger-fish of 20 lb., at the\r\nimminent risk of capsizing and joining the company of the engaging\r\ncrocodiles, or, when he has grassed the fish, of having a finger\r\nbitten off by his iron teeth, and then, I think, he will admit, so far\r\nas his scanty breath will allow him, that an hour's fishing may\r\nafford all the excitement which an average man can support.\r\n\r\nSo much for the fish of the country. But Central South Africa affords\r\na magnificent field for the introduction and acclimatisation of the\r\ngreatest of sporting fish. Ceylon and New Zealand have already shown\r\nwhat can be done with the trout in new waters, and in Cape Colony and\r\nNatal the same experiment has been made with much success. The high\r\nveld is only less good than New Zealand as a home for trout. To be\r\nsure, there is no snow-water, but there is the next best thing in\r\nwater whose temperature varies very little all the year round. The\r\nordinary sluggish spruits are of course unsuitable, but the mountain\r\nburns in the east and north are perfect natural trout-streams, with\r\nclear cold water, abundant fall, gravel bottoms, and all the feeding\r\nwhich the most gluttonous of fish could desire. The Transvaal Trout\r\nAcclimatisation Society, founded in Johannesburg in 1902, has\r\nestablished a hatchery on the Mooi River above Potchefstroom, and is\r\nmaking the most praiseworthy efforts, by the creation of local\r\ncommittees, to excite a general interest in the work throughout the\r\ncountry. It will still be some years before any trout-stream can be\r\nstocked and thrown open to anglers; but there is no reason why in time\r\nthere should not be one in most districts. The Mooi and the Klip\r\nrivers near Johannesburg, the Magalies and the Hex rivers in\r\nRustenburg, the Upper Malmani in Lichtenburg, every stream in\r\nMagatoland and the Wood Bush, the torrents which fall from Lydenburg\r\ninto the flats, and all the many mountain streams which run into\r\nSwaziland from the high veld, may yet be as good trout-waters as any\r\nin Lochaber. The rainbow and the Lochleven trout will be the staple\r\nimportation; but in some of the larger streams experiments might be\r\nmade with the American ouananiche and the Danubian huchen. It is\r\ndifficult to exaggerate the service which might thus be rendered to\r\nthe country. If in the dams and streams within easy distance of the\r\ntowns a sound form of sport can be provided at reasonable cost, the\r\nfirst and greatest of the amenities of life will have been introduced.\r\nAt present on the Rand there are no proper modes of relaxation: most\r\nmen work till they drop, and then take their jaded holiday in Europe.\r\nYet how many, if they had the chance, would go off from Saturday to\r\nMonday with their rods, and find by the stream-side the old healing\r\nquiet of nature?\r\n\r\nThere is a future for South African sport if South Africa is alive to\r\nher opportunity. It is a country of sportsmen, and sport with the\r\nbetter sort of man is a sound basis of friendship. Game Preservation\r\nSocieties are being started in many districts, and when we find the two\r\nraces united in a common purpose, which touches not politics or dogma\r\nbut the primitive instincts of humankind, something will have been done\r\ntowards unity. The matter is equally important from the standpoint of\r\ngame protection. The private landowner can do more than the land\r\ncompany, and the land company can do more than the Government, towards\r\nensuring the future of sport. Many Dutch farmers have preserved in the\r\npast, and a general extension of this spirit would work wonders in a\r\nfew years. Vanishing species would be saved, banished game would\r\nreturn, and our conscience would be clear of one of the most heinous\r\nsins of civilisation. As an instance of what can be done by private\r\neffort, there is a farm not sixty miles from a capital city where at\r\nthis moment there are impala, rooi hartebeest, koodoo, and wild\r\nostrich.\r\n\r\nThere are few countries in the world where sport can be enjoyed in\r\nmore delectable surroundings. The cold fresh mornings, when the mist\r\nis creeping from the grey hills and the vigour of dawn is in the\r\nblood; the warm sun-steeped spaces at noonday; the purple dusk, when\r\nthe veld becomes a kind of Land East of the Sun and West of the Moon,\r\nfull of fairy lights and mysterious shadows; the bitter night, when\r\nthe southern constellations blaze in the profound sky,--he who has\r\nonce seen them must carry the memory for ever. It is such things, and\r\nnot hunger and thirst and weariness, which remain in a man's mind. For\r\nthe lover of nature and wild things (which is to say the true\r\nsportsman) it is little wonder if, after these, home and ambition and\r\na comfortable life seem degrees of the infinitely small. And the\r\nothers, who are only brief visitors, will carry away unforgettable\r\npictures to tantalise them at work and put them out of all patience\r\nwith an indoor world--the bivouac under the stars on the high veld, or\r\nsome secret glen of the Wood Bush, or the long lines of hill which\r\nhuddle behind Lydenburg into the sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [12]  In other parts of British Africa the policy of reserves\r\n        has received full recognition. In East Africa there are\r\n        two large reserves, one along the Uganda Railway and\r\n        the other near Lake Rudolf. In the Soudan there is a\r\n        vast reserve between the Blue and the White Niles, and\r\n        most of the best shooting-ground throughout the country\r\n        is strictly protected.\r\n\r\n  [13]  The eland is the one conspicuous exception.\r\n\r\n  [14]  A Transvaal friend informs me that my classification,\r\n        though the one commonly in use, is quite inaccurate. The\r\n        yellow-fish and the white-fish are not carp but species\r\n        of barbel, and what I have called barbel is another\r\n        variant of the same family, called by the Dutch\r\n        \"kalverskop,\" or \"calf's-head,\" from its shape. There is\r\n        no true carp, though the Dutch give the name of \"kurper\"\r\n        to a very curious little fish about four inches long\r\n        which is common in streams flowing into the Vaal. The\r\n        other chief varieties are the coarse mud-fish and the\r\n        cat-fish, which latter is often mixed up with the\r\n        barbel. It is to be hoped that some local ichthyologist\r\n        will give his attention to the native fishes--a very\r\n        interesting subject, and one at present in the most\r\n        unscientific confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC FACTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a three years' war, and at the cost of over 200 millions,\r\nBritain has secured for her own children the indisputable possession\r\nof the new colonies. In earlier chapters an attempt has been made to\r\nsketch roughly the historical influences which may help to shape the\r\nfuture and to describe the actual features of the land which charm and\r\nperplex the beholder. We have now to face the direct problems into\r\nwhich the situation can be resolved, and in particular that question\r\nof material wellbeing which is the most insistent, because the most\r\neasily realised, for both statesman and people. The economic factor in\r\nthe politics of a country is always a difficult matter to discuss, for\r\nit is made up of infinite details, some of them purely speculative,\r\nall of them hard to disentangle. If a business man were to do what he\r\nnever does, and sit down to analyse calmly his position, he would have\r\nto go far beyond balance-sheets and statements of profit and loss. He\r\nwould be compelled to look into the social and economic conditions\r\nunder which he lived; he would have to estimate rival activities and\r\nforecast their development; the money market, rates of exchange, the\r\nnature of the labour supply, the effect of political and social\r\nmovements, even such matters as his own bodily and mental health, and\r\nhis standing among his fellows, would properly make part of the\r\ninquiry. With the private individual the analysis would be ridiculous,\r\nbecause the component parts are too minute to realise; but with a\r\nnation, where the lines are broader, some stock-taking of this kind is\r\nperiodically desirable. But in spite of, or because of, the complexity\r\nof the inquiry, the human mind is apt to complicate it needlessly by\r\nrunning after side-issues and losing sight of the main features of the\r\nproblem. The economic position of a country embraces in a sense almost\r\nevery detail of human life; but there is no reason why the mass of\r\ndetail should be allowed to get out of focus and obscure the synthesis\r\nof the survey. Provided we remember that the economic factor is not\r\ncorrectly estimated by looking only at revenue and expenditure,\r\nimports and exports, and fiscal provisions, we may safely devote our\r\nenergies to steering clear of the labyrinth of secondary detail in\r\nwhich the ordinary statistician would seek to involve us.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages it is proposed to confine the survey to what\r\nappear to be the main features of a complex question. It would be vain\r\nto embark on speculations as to the payable ore in the ground, market\r\nforecasts, suggestions for new industries, and the many hints towards\r\na reformed fiscal system with which local and European papers have\r\nbeen crowded. It is sufficient to note the existence of such\r\nquestions; the materials for a true understanding of the South African\r\neconomy are not to be found in them. In particular it is proposed to\r\navoid needless statistics, which, apart from the fact that they are\r\noften inaccurate and partisan, are the buttress of that particularist\r\nlogic which is the foe of true reason. Two questions may be taken as\r\nthe general heads of our inquiry: first, Wherein consists the wealth\r\nof the land, actual and potential? and, secondly, How best may that\r\nwealth be maintained and developed for the national good?\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal economic fact is the existence of gold--gold as it is\r\nfound in no other country, not in casual pockets and reefs, but in\r\nquantities which can for the most part be accurately mapped out and\r\nvalued months and years before it is worked; gold which is mined not\r\nas an adventure, but as an organised and stable industry. The Main\r\nReef formation extends for sixty-two miles, from Randfontein to\r\nHolfontein,[15] but three-fourths of the gold mined has been produced\r\nin the central section, which is only some twelve miles long. In 1886\r\nthe district was proclaimed a public gold-field, and since that day\r\nore worth nearly 100 millions sterling has been extracted. The\r\ndevelopment took place in spite of difficulties which vastly increased\r\nthe working costs. The dynamite and railway monopolies, the heavy\r\nexpense of the transit of machinery from the coast, the absence of\r\nsubsidiary local industries to feed the gold industry, forced the work\r\ninto the hands of a small circle of rich firms who could provide the\r\nlarge capital and face the heavy risks of a new enterprise. It is\r\nclear, therefore, that mining on the Rand, while a notable enterprise,\r\nhas necessarily been a slow one, since the two natural factors, the\r\namount of gold in the soil and the labour of working it, have been\r\ncomplicated by many artificial hindrances. The past is not the true\r\nbasis for estimating the future of the industry; the proper premises\r\nfor a forecast are the two natural factors--the quantity of gold in\r\nthe earth and the normal cost of winning it. It is the first that\r\nconcerns us at present.\r\n\r\nAll estimates must be merely conjectural, and can be used only with\r\nthe greatest caution. But in the multitude of conjectures there may be\r\nsuch a consensus of opinion as to ensure us a fair certainty that this\r\nor that is the view of those who are best fitted to judge. Mr Bleloch,\r\nin a calculation based on the report of the most eminent engineers,\r\nvalues the amount of gold still in the Rand at 2871 millions sterling,\r\nshowing a profit to the companies concerned of over 975 millions. If\r\nwe put the life of the Rand at one hundred years, which is a mean\r\nbetween conflicting estimates, we shall have an average, allowing for\r\nreserve funds, of 8 millions to be paid yearly in dividends to\r\nshareholders. In 1898 twenty-six companies paid dividends amounting to\r\nover 4 millions: therefore, on Mr Bleloch's figures, we can promise at\r\nleast one hundred years to the Rand of twice the prosperity of 1898.\r\nThese figures include the deep levels, but do not take into account\r\nany of the Rand extensions, in which the Main Reef has been traced for\r\nover 300 miles. It is certain that in the direction of Heidelberg and\r\nGreylingstad gold in payable quantities exists for not less than\r\nseventy miles, and it is at least probable that a similar extension\r\nexists in the Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp districts in the west. So\r\nmuch for the peculiar \"banket\" formation of the Rand, which must\r\nremain the type of stable gold-mining,--stable, because the element of\r\nuncertainty over any group of properties is reduced to a minimum, and\r\nthe high organisation necessary and the large initial outlay produce a\r\ncommunity less of rivals than of fellow-workers. Quartz reefs and\r\nalluvial deposits are found in many parts of the country. In Lydenburg\r\nand Barberton, where the earliest gold mines were sunk, several\r\nproducing companies are at work; and this type of mining will develop\r\nequally with the Rand under a system which abolishes monopolies and\r\nassists instead of discouraging enterprise. In the northern districts,\r\naround the Wood Bush and the Zoutpansberg ranges, there are quartz and\r\nalluvial mining, and indications of \"banket\" formation, and in the all\r\nbut unknown region adjoining Portuguese territory, if tales be true,\r\nthere may be gold in quantities still undreamed of.\r\n\r\nNo figures are reliable, all estimates are disputed, but from the very\r\ncontradictions one fact emerges--that there is gold enough to give\r\nemployment to a greatly increased mining population for at least fifty\r\nyears, and to decentralise the industry and create large industrial\r\nbelts instead of one industrial city. Nor is gold the only mineral.\r\nFrom Pretoria to Piet Retief run coal-beds, many of them of great\r\nrichness and good quality, covering an area of more than 10,000 square\r\nmiles. It has been calculated that 60,000 million tons are available.\r\nThe quality of the coal in the undeveloped beds lying to the south of\r\nMiddelburg is, in the opinion of experts, equal to the best British\r\nproduct. Iron-ore is abundant in many parts, particularly in the\r\ncoal-bearing regions of the east. Lead has been worked near Zeerust,\r\nand there are good grounds for believing that copper in large\r\nquantities exists in Waterberg and in the tract between Pietersburg\r\nand the Limpopo. Diamond pipes are found in several places in the\r\nregion due east of Pretoria, where the new Premier Mine seems to\r\npromise a richness not equalled by Kimberley; and it is probable that\r\nplaces like the Springbok Flats and the western parts of Christiana\r\nare highly diamondiferous. Sapphires have been found in the west, and\r\ndiamonds and spinels are reported from the northern mountains. Few\r\ncountries have a soil more amply mineralised; but the sparse\r\npopulation, mainly absorbed in the quest of one mineral, has done\r\nlittle to exploit its wealth. Mining, save for gold and coal, is still\r\nin the Transvaal a thing of the future. The agricultural and pastoral\r\nwealth is dealt with in another chapter. But we may note an asset,\r\nwhich is wholly undeveloped, in the cultivation and protection of the\r\nnatural wood of the north and east, and the planting of imported\r\ntrees. Timber in an inland mining country is a valuable product, and\r\non the soil of the high veld new plantations spring up like mushrooms.\r\nTen feet a-year is the common rate of growth for gums, and in the\r\nwarmer tracts it is nearer twenty. Many indigenous South African\r\ntrees, which a few years ago, under an unwise system of timber\r\nconcessions, were disappearing from most places save a few sequestered\r\nglens in the north, might under proper care become a lucrative branch\r\nof forestry. Current estimates, rough and inaccurate as they must be,\r\nare the fruit of a very general conviction, which on the broadest\r\nbasis is amply supported by facts. There is sufficient natural\r\nwealth--mineral, pastoral, and agricultural--to provide a sound\r\nindustrial foundation for the new States. It is only on the details of\r\nits exploitation that experts differ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn any calculation of natural wealth there is another factor to be\r\nnoted which controls production and dictates its method. Whatever the\r\nnatural riches of a country may be, climate and situation must be\r\nweighed in their practical estimate. A diamond pipe at the South Pole\r\nand acres of rich soil in Tibet are practically as valueless as a fine\r\nanchorage on the Sahara coast or a bracing climate in Tierra del\r\nFuego. In the new colonies we have throughout three-fourths of their\r\narea a climate where white men can labour out of doors all the year\r\nround. The remaining fourth is less pestilential than many places in\r\nCeylon, Burma, and the Malay Peninsula, where Europeans live and work.\r\nThere are certain very real climatic disadvantages--frequent\r\nthunderstorms, hailstorms in summer when fruits and crops are\r\nripening, rains concentrated over a few months, a long, dusty,\r\nwaterless winter. But these are difficulties which can be surmounted\r\nfor the most part by human ingenuity, and at the worst they place no\r\nabsolute bar on enterprise. From the standpoint of health the climate\r\nis nearly perfect, inducing a vigour and alertness of body and mind\r\nwhich in the more feverish life of cities may ruin the nerves and\r\nprematurely age a man, but in all wholesome forms of labour enable\r\nwork to be done at a maximum pressure and with the minimum discomfort.\r\nIn valuing, therefore, the natural assets of the new colonies, we need\r\nwrite off nothing for climatic hindrances. The situation is a more\r\ndoubtful matter. They pay for their freedom from the low heats of the\r\ncoast by the absence of private outlets for trade and the consequent\r\ndifficulties which all people must meet who have to hire others to do\r\ntheir shipping and carrying. It is not the difficulty of Missouri or\r\nOhio or other inland states in one territory, but of separate peoples,\r\nwith interests often conflicting, who have to submit to weary customs\r\nand railway arrangements before their outlet can exist. This is one,\r\nperhaps the only, genuine natural limitation which all schemes of\r\neconomic development must take account of.\r\n\r\nThe country is not new, and therefore in sketching its natural wealth\r\nwe do not exhaust the preliminaries of the question. There are\r\nready-made industrial conditions to be considered which may modify our\r\nestimate of the initial equipment. Such are the commercial structures\r\nalready built up in the great commercial centre, which for this\r\npurpose represents the new colonies; the nature and future of the\r\nlabour supply; the existing markets; the already prepared means of\r\ntransit. The gold industry, as was to be expected from its nature,\r\nhas fallen into the hands of a few houses. Eight great financial\r\ngroups control the wealth of the Rand: the Eckstein group alone has\r\ninterests which might be capitalised at 70 millions; the Consolidated\r\nGold-fields at about 30 millions. The reason for this state of\r\naffairs is obvious. Gold-mining in the Rand fashion is a costly\r\nbusiness, and altogether beyond the reach of the small man: claims\r\nwere bought up by the financiers who were first in possession, and,\r\nsince they were able to hold and develop, the entry of other\r\nfinancial houses has been blocked. But the great mining firms do not\r\nconfine their activity to gold. They own millions of acres of land\r\nthroughout the country, and many valuable building sites in the\r\ntowns. Originally, doubtless, land was bought purely as a mining\r\nspeculation, but they are not slow, in the absence of minerals, to\r\nmake out of it what they can. These Rand houses are the bugbear of a\r\ncertain class of politician. The Rand is closed to the small man, so\r\nruns the cry; a system of trusts is being created; in a little while\r\nthe country will be under the iron heel of a financial ring. It is\r\nassumed that the mining firms will turn their attention to ordinary\r\ncommerce, and oust the independent trader and cultivator and the\r\nsmall manufacturer. Certain trading experiments by some of the chief\r\nhouses, and an attempt to grow food-supplies for their own employees,\r\ngive a certain support to the forecast.\r\n\r\nIf the Trust system in its American form were ever to become a reality\r\nin South Africa, the obvious and infallible checks against too wide an\r\nexpansion would arise there as elsewhere. A trust can only exist in\r\nfull strength under its originators. There can be no apostolic\r\nsuccession in trust management; the second or the third generation\r\nmust be on a lower scale, and the great fabric will crumble. A huge\r\ncombination can only be maintained by perpetual energy and ceaseless\r\nlabour, and, like the empire of Charlemagne, it will dwindle under a\r\nsuccessor. A trust can be created but not perpetuated. No group of\r\ndirectors, no paid manager, can maintain the nicety of judgment and\r\nthe sleepless care which alone can preserve from decay an artificial\r\nstructure imposed upon an unwilling society. But in the case of the\r\nnew colonies there are special reasons which make this development\r\nhighly improbable. A trust flourishes only on highly protected soil,\r\nand Free Trade must long be predominant in the Transvaal. Again, while\r\nthere can never be a trust in gold, the market being unlimited and\r\nbeyond any possibility of control, gold-mining must remain the chief\r\ninterest for any group of firms who desired to establish a trust in\r\nother commodities. Now gold-mining is one-third an industry and\r\ntwo-thirds a scientific inquiry. An ordinary trust is concerned less\r\nwith production than with the control of the markets and the methods\r\nof distribution. But all progress in Rand mining depends on nice and\r\nspeculative scientific calculation. To reduce the working costs by\r\nimproved appliances, so that ore of a low grade may become payable, is\r\nso vital a matter with every great firm which is concerned in\r\ngold-mining, that the commercial or trust side, which must be\r\nconcerned not with gold but with other forms of production, is not\r\nlikely to be given undue prominence. Human capacity is limited, and no\r\nman or body of men can meet these two very different classes of\r\nproblems at the same time. The experiments of mining firms in other\r\ntrades have been due far more to the immense cost of imports and the\r\nabsence of subsidiary industries than to a Napoleonic desire for\r\nconsolidation. There is room, abundant room, in the Transvaal for\r\nironworks and factories, for the private trader and the independent\r\nfarmer; and the bogey of the great houses resolves itself in practice\r\ninto little more than a stimulating example in progressive business\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks do not, however, touch the question whether or\r\nnot the gold industry is to remain a preserve of a few groups. If it\r\nis, there can be little real objection. The market for gold can never\r\nbe controlled like the diamond-market, and there is small fear of a\r\ngold-mining De Beers dictating to the world. Moreover, the great\r\ngroups are not static but mobile, constantly dividing and subdividing,\r\nthrowing off subsidiary companies and adding new ones, no more\r\nmonopolists than the cotton-spinners of Manchester or the shipbuilders\r\nof Glasgow. The fact remains that they own most of the mining rights\r\nin the country, and all development must lie very much in their hands.\r\nThe owner of the minerals on a farm in Potchefstroom is at liberty to\r\nform a company and work them himself. But the case will be uncommon,\r\nsince the bulk of the mineral rights are already absorbed, and, on\r\nthe Rand system of mining, an unknown adventurer would have difficulty\r\nin raising the large initial capital. It is only in this sense that\r\nthere is any meaning in the charge of monopoly. A more real grievance\r\nis that a great house will often buy up claims throughout the country\r\nand leave them unworked till it suits its pleasure, thereby hindering\r\nindustrial development. This, in a sense, is true, but the reason is to\r\nbe found mainly in the difficulty of development under recent\r\nconditions,--conditions which, for the matter of that, would have\r\npressed far more hardly on the small man than on the rich firms. So far\r\nas the gold industry is concerned, the plaint of the humble citizen on\r\nthis score is a little ridiculous. He asks an impossibility, and in his\r\nheart admits the folly of the request.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the anti-capitalist parrot-cry were recognised in its\r\ntrue meaning. On the Rand it is not the wail of a downtrodden\r\nproletariat or of the industrious small merchant whose occupation is\r\ngone. It is the dishonest agitation of a speculating class who find\r\ntheir activity limited by the strenuous and rational policy of the\r\ngreat houses. I would suggest as a fair parallel the outcry of small\r\nand disreputable publicans in a rising town where it has been found\r\nprofitable to open good restaurants and decent hotels. Without capital\r\nthe Transvaal is a piece of bare veld; with capital wrongly applied it\r\nis a hunting-ground for the adventurer and the bogus-promoter. The\r\ngold industry depends on capital, because only capital combined with\r\nintelligence and patience could have raised it from a speculation to\r\nan industry. But facts are the most eloquent form of apologetics. At\r\nthe moment over 30 millions have been spent on development by\r\nproducing companies, leaving out of account the large administrative\r\nand office expenses. How much has been spent in the same way on mines\r\nwhich have not reached the producing stage it is impossible to say,\r\nbut the figure must be very large. To start an ordinary deep-level\r\nmine costs nearly a million before any profits are made. Surely it is\r\nright to see in an organisation which is prepared to face such an\r\noutlay some qualities of courage and patience. It is possible that the\r\ngreat houses may find themselves in conflict with the best public\r\nopinion on certain matters before the day is done; but it is well to\r\nrecognise that the very existence of an industrial population is due\r\nto capital wisely and patiently used by the strong men who were the\r\nmakers of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLast in our calculation of assets comes the existing or accessible\r\nmachinery of exploitation and production--the labour supply, the means\r\nof transit, the available markets. The first is a complicated matter\r\non which it is hard to dogmatise. For some months it has been the most\r\nstrenuously canvassed of South African problems. On its solution\r\ndepends without doubt not only the future prosperity but the immediate\r\ninsolvency of the country. And at the same time, being bound up more\r\nthan other economic questions with far-reaching political interests,\r\nits solution has become less a commercial adjustment than a piece of\r\nnational policy. As was to be expected in this kind of discussion, the\r\ntrue issues have been habitually obscured. The antithesis is not\r\nbetween labour and no labour, but in one aspect between the cheap,\r\nunskilled native and the dear, more highly skilled white; and in\r\nanother between a limited supply, which means the curtailment of\r\nenterprise, and an unlimited supply, even of a lower quality, which\r\nwould allow full development. Again, the antithesis is not absolute,\r\nas has been often assumed: the true solution may lie in a compromise,\r\na delicate cutting of the coat to suit the particular cloths employed\r\nin its making.\r\n\r\nIt is almost entirely a mining question. In most other industries the\r\nwork can be done by white men with the assistance of a few natives. In\r\nagriculture, as things stand at present, sufficient native labour can\r\nbe procured, and under an improved system of taxation the supply might\r\nbe largely increased, within limits. The demand in agriculture should\r\ndiminish rather than increase, save in the tropical and sub-tropical\r\nregions, where native labour is always plentiful. On the high veld a\r\nsingle farmer, if he ploughs with oxen, wants a boy as a voorlooper\r\nand another to use the whip; but this and similar work may well be\r\nperformed in time by his own sons or by white servants. Railway\r\nconstruction will draw heavily on the supply, but its requirements\r\nare, after all, limited and small in comparison with the immense needs\r\nof the mines. For in the latter a very large number of employees is\r\nnecessary, the bulk of the work is unskilled, and the conditions under\r\nwhich it must be performed are frequently such as to deter the\r\nordinary European. The case is not quite that of labour in the West\r\nIndian plantations with which it has been compared, but there are\r\nmany points of resemblance. The labour, on the current view, must be\r\ncheap; it must exist in large quantities; and the work is bound in\r\ncertain respects to be hard and unpleasant--not perhaps harder than\r\ncoal-mining in England, but, taking into account the superior average\r\nof comfort in the new colonies, indubitably more unattractive to the\r\nlocal workman.\r\n\r\nBefore the war some 90,000 natives were employed in the Witwatersrand\r\nmines. The average cost was from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a-day, food and\r\nlodging being provided; but the expense of acquiring the labour\r\nconsiderably raised the actual price per man. The old method was by a\r\nsystem of touts, who were paid as much as L5 a-head for their\r\nimportation. The system led to great abuses, chicanery, needless\r\ncompetition false promises, which often cut off the supply in a whole\r\nterritory. To meet the difficulty the Witwatersrand Native Labour\r\nAssociation was formed, whose duties were to recruit native labour and\r\ndistribute it equitably to the mines within the association. Its\r\nagents were paid by salaries instead of by results, and the various\r\nnative locations in the Transvaal, Swaziland, and Portuguese territory\r\nwere exploited by them. But with all its efforts the mines were\r\ninadequately supplied. The 90,000 natives barely sufficed to maintain\r\nthe _status quo_, and there was no margin for new development. The war\r\nscattered the accumulated supply. The local natives grew rich in\r\nmilitary service, and declined to leave their kraals. Those imported\r\nfrom a distance returned to their homes, and the whole work of\r\ncollection had to begin again. In October 1902, which may be taken as\r\na fair date to estimate the condition of things after the war, only\r\n31,000 natives were at work, one-third of the former staff. By May\r\n1903, after herculean efforts, the supply had increased to a little\r\nover 41,000.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, therefore, a very serious one. To return to the old\r\nstate of things the present supply must be doubled; to provide for any\r\nadequate progress it must at the lowest estimate be multiplied by ten.\r\nAny wholesale increase to the mining wealth of the country must come\r\nfrom the exploital of the deep level and the low-grade properties. The\r\nworking costs per ton of ore run from 17s. 6d. to 30s.; on the Rand\r\nthe average is about 27s.[16] But the ordinary low-grade mines produce\r\nore worth little more than 18s. to 20s. a-ton. To make their\r\ndevelopment possible the working cost must be reduced to 15s.-17s.\r\nImproved machinery may do something, but the first necessity is cheap\r\nlabour. But where are the natives to come from? The efforts of the\r\nNative Labour Associations have not succeeded in showing that the need\r\ncan be met from any of the old supply grounds. New taxation and the\r\nspending of their war savings may drive some of the Transvaal natives\r\nto the mines; but as the total native population of the colony is only\r\nabout three quarters of a million, the whole working male force, which\r\nmay be taken at one in ten, would not meet the demand. In addition to\r\nthis we have the fact that no taxation would reach more than one-half\r\nof the population, and that of this half three-quarters is probably\r\nunfit for mining work. The total native population south of the\r\nZambesi is at the present moment a little over 6 millions. Supposing\r\nthis field were worked to the uttermost, we should still scarcely meet\r\nthe demands likely to arise within the next five years for the gold\r\nindustry alone; and such exhaustive exploitation is beyond the wildest\r\ndream of any Chamber of Mines.\r\n\r\nThe case may be stated thus. With all assistance from local taxation\r\nand from the amended organisation of the Native Labour Association,\r\nAfrica, south of the Zambesi, will be unable to afford the unlimited\r\nsupply of native labour which is the _sine qua non_ of mining progress.\r\nIt would therefore appear that a new ground of supply must be sought.\r\nBy those who admit this (and as will appear later, there are some who\r\ndo not) three solutions have been advocated, none of which is\r\nunattended with difficulties. The first is to find a recruiting-ground\r\nin the vast district between the Zambesi and the White Nile, a region\r\nmore densely populated by the aborigines than any other part of Africa.\r\nThis scheme has been urged by Sir Harry Johnston with all the weight of\r\nhis unrivalled experience. The advantages of the solution are numerous.\r\nThose natives live directly or indirectly under British sway. They are\r\nunsophisticated, and the old rate of wages would mean undreamed-of\r\nwealth to them. Moreover, the experiment would be of a certain\r\nassistance to Central Africa, for on their return home with their wages\r\nmoney would be put into circulation, the standard of living would rise,\r\ntaxes would be easier to collect, and Government and governed would\r\nmutually profit. On the other hand, there are very many reasons against\r\nthe proposal. Uganda and Nyassaland, to take the two chief instances,\r\nare in need of labour for their own development, and will strenuously\r\nresist its exportation. Their nascent civilisation will be dislocated\r\nif they are made the hunting-ground of labour agents. Nor is it clear\r\nthat the Central African native is suited for mining purposes, since\r\nboth in constitution and the food he lives on he differs from his\r\nsouthern kinsman, and, in the opinion of many good authorities, his\r\ntransplantation to the high veld would mean a swollen death-rate.\r\nOvertures have also been made to Northern and Southern Nigeria, but the\r\nanswer from those territories is still more hopeless. It is too early\r\nto pronounce on the future of the Central African scheme. A fair _prima\r\nfacie_ case can be made out for its success, and the result of the\r\nfirst experiments has not been wholly discouraging. But in any case it\r\nis certain that from this source no unlimited or permanent supply can\r\ncome. A modicum, perhaps gradually increasing, may be secured, and in\r\nthis day of small things we can be thankful for any increase in native\r\nAfrican labour. But great care is necessary in its working. There must\r\nbe no hint of coercion; the native must be vigilantly looked after from\r\nthe day he leaves his kraal to the day he returns at the end of his\r\ntwelvemonth's service,--for the districts must be nursed, and it is on\r\nthe report of the first batches that the success of the enterprise\r\ndepends. The transport will cost money, but it is doubtful if it will\r\nwork out at more per head than the old premium for importation.\r\n\r\nThe second solution has roused a storm of opposition, and its adoption\r\nwould mean the overthrow of the old economics of the mining industry.\r\nIt is proposed to use Kaffirs only in the deepest levels and in work\r\nunsuited for white men (for which the present supply will suffice),\r\nand in all other tasks to employ white labour. The white workman on\r\nthe Rand under present conditions will be more than four times as dear\r\nas the native, costing 8s. 6d. as against the Kaffir's 2s. a-day. Many\r\narguments to justify the expense have been brought forward, of which\r\nthe weakest is that the white man can do four times the Kaffir's work.\r\nIn many branches of unskilled labour he can barely compete with him.\r\nThe real argument is concerned with the more general aspects of the\r\nproblem. In a highly organised industry there is bound to be a higher\r\nmaximum efficiency and regularity from a staff of white employees, who\r\nare working intelligently to better themselves and have certain\r\npolitical and social interests at stake in their labour. On political\r\ngrounds, again, it is most desirable, for apart from relieving the\r\nstrain on congested home districts, it would provide a feeding-ground\r\nfor South African development, a material wherewith to colonise the\r\nwilds of the north. The sons of the white men would go out to farm and\r\nmine for themselves; and in two generations, when the Rand has become\r\na normal industrial centre, we should have that interchange of\r\npopulation between town and country which is one of the buttresses of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nThe white labour movement has roused bitter opposition, partly from\r\nthe mining houses, and to some extent from white workmen on the Rand,\r\nwho wish to make a monopoly of their position. Many of the arguments\r\nagainst the scheme need not detain us. There is no objection to white\r\nand black labour working side by side, any more than there is an\r\nobjection on a tropical fruit-farm to a white man digging an orchard\r\nand a Kaffir carting manure for it, or on board ship to a white mate\r\nand a black cook being part of the same crew. The white man will have\r\nthe presence of his fellows, the chance of advancement, and a higher\r\nwage to support his self-respect, which must be a brittle article\r\nindeed if it requires further strengthening. Nor is there much\r\njustification for the fears of those who see in white labour the\r\nbeginning of endless labour troubles, culminating in the tyranny of\r\nthe working man. The situation would be the same as in any other\r\nindustrial city--as in Manchester, Sheffield, or Glasgow, where the\r\nbulk of the population are industrial employees. Strikes and lock-outs\r\nwill come, but it is better to have in an English city a free and\r\nvigorous English population, than to bolster up the chief industry by\r\nan exotic labour system. Besides, there is always the Kaffir as a\r\ncounterfoil, a very strong argument to inspire moderation in the\r\nlabourer's demands. White labour remains the ideal, the proper aim of\r\nall right-thinking men; but for the present it is more or less an\r\nimpossibility. It simply does not meet the economic difficulty. Unless\r\nthe Mines are content to make the _gran rifiuto_, curtail production,\r\nand play a waiting game,--a decision, as we shall see, quite as\r\nruinous to the country as to the shareholder,--cheap labour under\r\npresent conditions is a sheer necessity. One argument on economic\r\ngrounds has been brought forward for white labour, which runs somewhat\r\nas follows: Expansion and development depend upon an unlimited\r\nlabour-supply; white labour gives such an unlimited supply,--therefore\r\nit would pay to give four times the present wage and secure expansion\r\nrather than keep to the old scale and stagnate. Supposing a mining\r\ngroup to have a capital of ten millions, of which four are sunk in\r\nworking mines, three held in reserve, and three invested in good but\r\nundeveloped claims. The present state of things allows of a dividend\r\nof 40 per cent on the first four millions; white labour would reduce\r\nthe dividend to 20 per cent. But if white labour allowed the exploital\r\nof the unworked claims, so that a dividend of 20 to 25 per cent could\r\nbe paid on the other six millions, it would be good business for the\r\nfirm. It would, but it is not the problem before us. The argument\r\nassumes that the new properties are of the same class as those at\r\npresent paying dividends, whereas they are in the main of so low a\r\ngrade or demand such an immense initial outlay that, so far from\r\nshowing a profit with dear labour, they would be the ruin of their\r\npromoters.\r\n\r\nThe third proposal is to introduce Chinese[17] labour under short-time\r\ncontracts and a rigorous supervision. Its supporters argue with much\r\nreason that the Chinaman has been found useful as a deep-level miner;\r\nthat he is thrifty, intelligent, law-abiding, and tolerably clean;\r\nthat, supposing 200,000 Chinamen were employed in the mines, it would\r\nstill mean not less than 40,000 white workers, so that white labour\r\nwould increase in a liberal ratio; that a proper compound system and a\r\nstrict limit to the term of engagement would secure the country\r\nagainst the economic dangers which threaten Australia and the United\r\nStates. It is not yet certain that this ample supply of Chinese labour\r\ncan be obtained, the matter being in process of investigation; but\r\nthere is this to be said for the proposal, that it is the only one\r\nwhich touches directly the needs of the situation. The others are\r\ncounsels of perfection, ends of policy on which all are agreed; this\r\nalone offers an immediate satisfaction to a very pressing want. The\r\nonly argument which can be brought against it is not economic[18] but\r\npolitical,--that its use would endanger the success of those very\r\naims on which all are agreed. The Chinese are the born interlopers of\r\nthe world. Whatever care we take there will be a leakage: a Chinese\r\npopulation, more feared, apparently, for its virtues than its vices,\r\nwill grow up in the cities, the small trades will be shut to\r\nEuropeans, the whole standard of life for the masses will be lowered,\r\nand the moral and social currency of the nation debased. The real\r\ncase, therefore, of the opponent of Chinese labour, is that it is not\r\npossible to carry out the proposed plan; that we cannot import men on\r\na fixed contract and deport them at the end of it; that we cannot\r\nbuild our compound walls so high as to prevent a leakage into the\r\nouter world; that, in short, the law is too weak to do its duty. There\r\nis no difference between any of the disputants on the danger of\r\nletting the labour loose in the country; but the one side maintains\r\nthat with proper precaution this peril can be averted, the other that\r\nit is like the sea when it has found an entrance into a sea-wall, a\r\nlittle trickle which inevitably becomes a deluge. It is not a very\r\nconvincing contention, though we can respect the honest political\r\ninstincts which support it; indeed, there is a touch of that familiar\r\nfallacy, the \"thin-end-of-the-wedge\" argument, which opposes an\r\nundoubtedly beneficent reform because of its possible maleficent\r\nextension. The conflict is between an instant economic need and a\r\npotential political danger, and, with all desire to move cautiously,\r\nthe wisest course would seem to be to meet the one, and trust to the\r\ngood sense and courage of the people to avert the other. The problem\r\nof alien labour is indeed becoming a familiar one to many Crown\r\nColonies. The Colonial Office has been asked to sanction the\r\nimportation of Chinamen to Ashanti, and the Rhodesian Immigration\r\nOrdinance of 1901 made the enterprise legal for Southern Rhodesia.[19]\r\nIn the Transvaal there is a unique field for an experiment on sane and\r\npolitic lines, and for the creation of a sound administrative\r\nprecedent for other colonies to follow. There is a result, too, which\r\nmay reasonably be hoped for from the provision of cheap labour which\r\nwould be of direct political value. It would enable some of the\r\nsmaller properties throughout the country to be worked at a profit,\r\nand so might in time redeem the gold industry from the capitalist\r\nmonopoly, which it must remain under present conditions, and create a\r\nclass of small mine-owners, on the analogy of the small coal-owners in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThere is one final argument against imported labour which demands a\r\nshort notice, for it has been used by many serious men who are not\r\ngiven to captious objections. If we take the original capital of most\r\nmines we shall find that it has been extensively watered, and that\r\neven on the nominal capital there is a huge appreciation. A mine, to\r\ntake an extreme instance, begins with a capital of L50,000 in L1\r\nshares; subsequently the shareholders receive eleven L5 shares for\r\nevery L1 share, making the present nominal capital L2,750,000. The\r\nquotation of those L5 shares is, say, L10-7/8, making the total\r\ncapital value L5,981,250. A gold output which, under present\r\nconditions, is not sufficient to pay a fair dividend upon this\r\ncapitalisation, would be amply sufficient to pay a dividend on the\r\nnominal capital, and more than sufficient to pay 500 per cent on the\r\noriginal capital. The question, therefore, of dividend-paying is out\r\nof all relation to the actual margin of profit on the working of a\r\nmine. The deduction is that the companies have themselves to blame,\r\nand must face a depreciation in their shares; and the unfortunate\r\ninvestor who has bought L5 shares at L10, believing a return of 4 per\r\ncent on his capital certain, must console himself with the reflection\r\nthat every man must pay for his folly. This argument is final against\r\nany _ad misericordiam_ plea of the companies, but it does not touch\r\nthe heart of the question. The working of the large over-capitalised\r\nproperties is one thing, and the development of low-grade properties,\r\non which large sums have been spent and for which no profits have yet\r\nbeen earned, is quite another. The old well-established mines can\r\nafford to fight their own battles, and for the matter of that, in\r\nspite of their heavy expenditure out of capital during the war, are\r\nmostly paying dividends even under present conditions: the new\r\nproperties, on which the future of the country depends, are not, as a\r\nrule, over-capitalised, and, as we have seen, the margin of profit is\r\nso small on each ton of ore, that the question is reduced to its bare\r\nessentials--Is it possible to mine ore worth twenty shillings at a\r\ncost under a pound? But even as concerns the richer companies the\r\nargument is scarcely valid, for it leaves out of account that not\r\ninconsiderable factor, the credit of the country. It is so essential\r\nthat new capital should be attracted for the twenty different needs of\r\ndevelopment, to which any Government loan can only be a trifling\r\ncontribution, that anything which tends to shake the confidence of the\r\nworld in the commercial structure of South Africa is the gravest\r\ndanger. Is it certain, too, that that much-abused epithet of \"_bona\r\nfide_ investor\" is not applicable to the men who bought high-priced\r\nsecurities, not as a speculation, but as a modest investment?\r\n\r\nIt is often said by opponents of imported labour that its introduction\r\nwill scarcely have taken place before an agitation will be begun for\r\nits withdrawal. So far from being an argument against the experiment,\r\nthis is precisely the strongest which could be urged in its favour. If\r\nthe desire of the country is for white labour, then the Chinaman can\r\nbe tried with little danger. The mine-owners will find in time that\r\nwork on a time contract by alien labourers is far from satisfactory,\r\nand when other circumstances permit they will no doubt readily adopt\r\nthat system of free competitive labour which only a white industrial\r\nclass can create. Had there been any chance of the experiment being\r\ntried with complete popular approval, then the danger would have been\r\nconsiderable, for the Chinaman might easily have spread from mining to\r\nall industries and trades; but since it will be made in spite of an\r\ninfluential opposition, and will be jealously watched by unfriendly\r\neyes, it seems inevitable that when it has played its part it will be\r\nwillingly dispensed with. By refusing to accept the experiment we are\r\ndoing our best to frustrate all hopes of a white population by\r\ncramping the development of the country at its most critical time and\r\nmaking a livelihood impossible for many of the existing white working\r\nmen. When mines are shut down because of a lack of underground\r\nlabourers, what becomes of the Englishmen who work above ground? It is\r\na significant fact that many white miners, who were formerly the most\r\nbitter opponents of imported labour, are now its strenuous advocates,\r\nsince they and their class are beginning to feel the pinch.\r\n\r\nBut if the importation of Asiatics is undertaken, it should be on a\r\nvery clear understanding and with a very distinct object in view.\r\nThe thing is far too dangerous at the best to be made the domain of\r\nunconsidered experiments. The ideal of white labour in the long-run\r\nmust be preserved; and we must take jealous care that by the\r\ncreation of a foreign labouring class the way is not barred to that\r\nindustrialisation of the native races on which the future of South\r\nAfrica so largely depends. A maximum might be fixed by law--say\r\n300,000 unskilled labourers, which could be increased if necessary\r\nby later enactments; and in so far as the maximum could not be\r\nattained by white and black labour, Chinese might be imported as a\r\ncomplement. The complement would, let us hope, rapidly decrease as\r\nnew machinery lessened the amount of labour required, and the native\r\ndistricts of Africa were more fully exploited. All imported labour\r\nwould be subject to rigorous conditions as to compounds, length of\r\ncontract, and ultimate repatriation--conditions which any ordinary\r\npolice could enforce without difficulty. At the same time, the Native\r\nLabour Association should be made a Government department. As a\r\nprivate organisation it is not more efficient, and it is certainly\r\nless respected, than a Government department would be. What is wanted\r\nin all proper recruiting is the prestige of the Crown. Natives, who\r\nhave been often deceived by touts, and regard the offers of the Labour\r\nAssociation agents as so many idle words, would be ready enough to\r\nlisten to proposals made under the guarantee of the paramount chief.\r\nIt is a risky game for a Government to embark in private business; but\r\nthe Native Labour Association is not a business, but a department,\r\nconducted on the lines of a Government department, but without its\r\nprestige. Under the Crown its organisation would remain intact, but\r\nits status would be raised and its efficiency centupled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe railway system, immature as it is, has worked wonders for the\r\ncountry. With few lines, and those single and narrow gauge, with\r\nexorbitant rates of transit and a frequently ineffective organisation,\r\nit has still above all other factors made development possible. In\r\nformer days, when heavy mining machinery had to be brought by waggons\r\nfrom Kimberley or Natal or Delagoa Bay, a mine required to be rich\r\nindeed before it could be worked at a profit, enterprise was costly\r\nand perilous, and the result was the stagnation of all activities save\r\nthat one where enterprise was a primal necessity. Under the late\r\nGovernments one line ran through the two States, from Norval's Pont to\r\nPietersburg, with small branch lines in the Orange Free State to\r\nWinburg and Heilbron, and in the Transvaal to Springs and Klerksdorp.\r\nThe Natal line was continued from Charlestown to join the trunk line\r\nat Elandsfontein, and the Delagoa Bay line from Komati Poort to\r\nPretoria, with a little branch to Barberton and the beginnings of a\r\nbranch to the Selati gold-fields. The Transvaal had thus three direct\r\noutlets to the coast; the Orange Free State two, for a branch ran from\r\nthe Natal line at Ladysmith to the little eastern town of Harrismith.\r\nTwo broad necessities of railway policy therefore awaited the new\r\nGovernment. The existing system must be perfected and interconnected,\r\nnew routes to the coast created to relieve the present strain, the\r\nrailways of adjoining colonies brought into touch with each other, so\r\nas to make one general and consistent South African system. But more\r\nimportant than the perfecting of existing arrangements must be the\r\ntapping of the rich and remote districts. Occasionally both needs may\r\nbe exemplified in one line, but, roughly speaking, they are separate\r\nbranches of railway policy, undertaken on different grounds and in\r\nmany cases organised and financed on different methods. The experience\r\nof the United States, where railways were regarded as the cause and\r\nnot the consequence of development, and pushed boldly into desert\r\nplaces which in a few years, through their agency, became centres of\r\nindustry and population, is a safe guide, within limits, for South\r\nAfrica, provided that the wealth to be exploited is really there, and\r\nrailway extension does not cripple other works of equal necessity.\r\n\r\nOf the first class we have three chief examples. One--from Machadodorp\r\nto Ermelo--is already partially constructed. The second will run\r\nfrom Springs east to some point on this line, and so provide a\r\ndirect route for the Johannesburg traffic from Delagoa Bay and avoid\r\nthe awkward circuit by Pretoria. A further extension is projected by\r\nwhich the Springs-Ermelo line will be continued through Swaziland to\r\nDelagoa Bay and a complete alternative through route created. The\r\nthird is the extension of the present Klerksdorp branch to Fourteen\r\nStreams, which would provide a shorter route from the Transvaal to\r\nthe Cape, an infinitely shorter route from the Transvaal to Rhodesia,\r\nand would at the same time bring the coal districts of the country\r\nwithin reach of the diamond industry of Kimberley. In the second\r\nclass there is no limit to the number of possible and desirable\r\nrailways. The most important is, perhaps, the grain line, from\r\nBloemfontein to Johannesburg by Ficksburg, Bethlehem, and Wilge\r\nRiver, which would bring the great wheat-producing tracts of the\r\nConquered Territory within easy reach of the chief market. Next comes\r\nthe now completed Rand coal line from Vereeniging to Johannesburg.\r\nAnother coal line is projected from Witbank on the Delagoa Bay line\r\nto Springs, which would bring the produce of the chief Transvaal\r\ncollieries directly to the Rand and relieve the congested line\r\nbetween Elandsfontein and Pretoria. Of equal importance in the\r\nlong-run is a line from Krugersdorp by Rustenburg to some point, such\r\nas Lobatsi, on the Rhodesian railway, which would open up a district\r\nfamous for its fruits and tobacco, and give the pastoralists of\r\nBechuanaland, as well as of the more distant Rhodesia, a straight\r\nline to Johannesburg. Other lines of the same class are those from\r\nBelfast or Machadodorp to Lydenburg, from Nelspruit to Pilgrims'\r\nRest, and from Basutoland to Bloemfontein. Lastly, and lastly only\r\nbecause of its greater difficulty, the line should be continued north\r\nfrom Pietersburg along the Sand River, brought east between the\r\nSpelonken and the Magatoland mountains, past the little township of\r\nLouis Trichard, and then turned south across the basin of the Klein\r\nand the Groot Letaba to Leydsdorp, where it could join the completed\r\nSelati railway from Komati Poort.\r\n\r\nThe Railway Extension Conference held at Johannesburg in March 1903\r\nsanctioned the immediate construction of most of the lines mentioned\r\nabove, and recommended the others as objects to aim at when sufficient\r\nfunds were at the disposal of the Government. As the share of the\r\nGuaranteed Loan allocated for railway extension is only some five\r\nmillions, and as the proportion of any railway surplus which can be\r\ndevoted to the purpose is, as we shall see later, strictly limited, it\r\nis highly desirable to make use of private enterprise so far as\r\npossible in new constructions, providing always for an efficient State\r\noversight and an ultimate expropriation. The Klerksdorp-Fourteen\r\nStreams and the Krugersdorp-Lobatsi railways have already been\r\narranged for on this principle, and it is probable that the experiment\r\nwill be adopted in many of the smaller development lines. It is\r\nreasonable that a rich company, owning lands or mines, or requiring\r\nfor its own purposes some special railway connection, should, if it\r\ndesires a new line, undertake the financing of it. But at the same\r\ntime the principle of the ultimate State ownership of all railways\r\nshould be strictly adhered to, for the very good reason that in the\r\nrailways we have the chief security for development loans, and the\r\nmost productive of all the State assets. In few countries in the world\r\nis the expenditure on construction and maintenance so small, so that\r\nunder present conditions they yield a handsome return on capital\r\noutlay. The Netherlands and the Pretoria-Pietersburg railways have\r\nbeen acquired from their former owners, and the incomplete Selati and\r\nMachadodorp-Ermelo lines will shortly follow. If we take the price\r\npaid, with the addition in the latter case of the outlay necessary for\r\ncompletion, as the capital value, we shall find that the net receipts,\r\neven after the large reductions in rates which have been made and must\r\nbe maintained, show a generous percentage of profit.[20] It will be\r\nexplained later what part this important asset is called upon to play\r\nin the finance of the new colonies. So much for the main lines; but a\r\nsystem of light railways, constructed at small expense, is vital to\r\nthe mineral and agricultural exploitation of such districts as Bethel,\r\nLichtenburg, Wolmaranstad, and Waterberg, in the Transvaal and the\r\nsouthern part of the Orange River Colony. In a flat upland country,\r\nwhere animal transport for some years to come will be precarious and\r\nexpensive, where the roads are still unsuitable for steam haulage, and\r\nwhere coal is cheap, perfect conditions exist for an extensive\r\nlight-railway development.\r\n\r\nRailway extension, then, is one of the first demands of the country:\r\nit is comparatively easy to achieve, and most of the necessary capital\r\nhas already been found for it. But the omnipresent labour difficulty\r\nappears here as elsewhere, not indeed with the magnitude of the mining\r\nproblem, but with an equal insistence. To carry out the programme\r\nsketched above in any reasonable time, say three years, some 40,000\r\nnatives will be required. At the present moment the number employed is\r\nscarcely 5000, and 10,000 is the limit which the railways may recruit\r\nin South Africa by an agreement with the Chamber of Mines. Many\r\nnatives, such as the Basutos, will work on railways when they will not\r\ngo underground; and the agreed limit is fair enough to both parties.\r\nBut the balance cannot be secured without seriously trespassing upon\r\nthe supply grounds of the mines. The Uganda railway was built with\r\nimported labour, and it seems inevitable that the Central South\r\nAfrican railways must follow suit. The limited funds at their\r\ndisposal, and the difficulties in the way of the country's absorbing\r\nat the moment large numbers of unskilled workmen, make the employment\r\nof white navvies alone impossible. The railways, indeed, furnish a\r\nfine experimenting-ground for the importation of indentured foreign\r\nlabour under a short-time contract and a condition of repatriation.\r\nThe number they require is small: 10,000 will tide them over all\r\nimmediate needs; the nature of the work enables a complete supervision\r\nto be exercised; and while it is still doubtful whether alien labour\r\ncan be secured for the mines, experience has shown that for surface\r\nrailway work the supply is certain. In the congested districts of\r\nIndia and China the small cultivator, to whom land is the object of\r\nhis life, will gladly leave his home for one or two years if he can\r\nreturn with the money to buy a plot of ground; and when the return\r\nhome is the cause of the setting out there will be no trouble in\r\nrepatriation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe premier market, now and for many years, must be the Rand. Its\r\ngreat industrial population and the higher scale of living make it the\r\nnatural market for all native agricultural and pastoral products. So\r\nmuch so that the farmers in the eastern province of Cape Colony, in\r\nspite of heavy railway rates, found it profitable to send the bulk of\r\ntheir produce thither. This is at once the advantage and misfortune of\r\nthe country: advantage, in having an accessible market which it will\r\ntake years to glut; misfortune, in that the merits of the market to\r\nthe country producer mean costly living to the industrial inhabitants.\r\nThe difficulty will no doubt adjust itself; for if, as all believe,\r\nthe new colonies take many steps towards feeding themselves, and in\r\nconsequence the prices of necessaries fall, new and nearer markets\r\nwill arise in different parts of the country, and a genuinely\r\nself-supporting provincial society will be organised. New mining\r\ncentres in the north and east, possibly, too, in the west, may bring\r\nnew townships into being; old and semi-decayed dorps will revive; and\r\nthat novelty in the new colonies, towns like Brighton or Cheltenham,\r\nwhich exist purely for residence, may yet be found at Warm Baths for\r\nwinter, or on the shores of Lake Chrissie for the summer heats. The\r\nRand, again, will be the chief market for the subsidiary industries\r\nwhich must arise,--for coal and iron, for manufactured articles and\r\ndressed produce. It is too early in the day to talk in any serious\r\nsense of exports. The Transvaal, at any rate, will be for long a\r\nconsumer rather than a producer among the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous cost of living is the subject of the chief complaints\r\namong new-comers to South Africa. Before the discovery of gold the\r\nTransvaal was a cheap country to dwell in. A bullock which now costs\r\nL20 could be bought for L5; and a native, who now draws L3 or L4 per\r\nmonth in wages, was then very well content with 5s. Now there is\r\nhardly anything which is not scarcer and dearer in South Africa than\r\nin almost any other part of the globe. The causes of this high cost\r\nare partly natural and partly artificial; but all, I think, are\r\nterminable. The demands of the gold industry, the long distance from\r\nports, the sparse rural population, are obvious natural causes, all of\r\nwhich tend to modification and mutual adjustment. The artificial\r\ncauses are three: the cost of ocean freightage, the high railway\r\nrates, and the monopoly in the hands of a small mercantile class. The\r\nfirst can never be reduced below a fairly high figure, and in the loud\r\ncomplaint of \"shipping rings,\" which is in the mouth of most traders,\r\nthere is a little unfairness. It is too often the cloak which they\r\nuse to cover their own extortions. But reductions will certainly be\r\nmade, and in any case the chief force of the grievance, so far as\r\nnecessaries are concerned, will decline with the growth of local\r\nproduction. Railway rates have already suffered a substantial\r\ndecrease, and will be further reduced down to a certain point, which\r\nfor the present is determined by the fiscal needs of the country. For\r\nrailway rates are a form of taxation: the railways are the chief\r\nrevenue producer, and to lower the rates too far would be merely\r\nrobbing Peter to pay Paul--a form of relief which would need to be\r\nbalanced by some new form of taxation. The chief efficient cause of\r\nthe expense of living is undoubtedly the exorbitant monopoly of local\r\nmerchants. It is no exaggeration to say that anything sold at 100 per\r\ncent profit is to the ordinary trader a form of charity: legitimate\r\nbusiness begins for him at 120, or thereabouts. No class is so\r\nclamorous about its interests, so ready to identify its profits with\r\nnational wellbeing, and claim a monopoly of the purer civic emotions.\r\nBut no part of the economic situation is so radically unsound. The\r\nPolish Jew and the coolie make a profitable living throughout the\r\ncountry, not because the white population have no prejudice against\r\nthem, but because they are driven to their stores by the comparative\r\nreasonableness of their prices. This cause, as I have said, is\r\nartificial and terminable. The influx of a large population will\r\nincrease the area of competition, and reduce profits to a normal\r\nbasis. And this, again, depends on the prosperity of the mines; so\r\nthat we are brought round to the starting-point of all South African\r\neconomics. Once this result were achieved its benefits would react\r\non the mines, for with the decrease of the cost of living wages would\r\ngo down, and what is at present an ideal--an increase in the area\r\nover which white labour can be employed--would come within the sphere\r\nof practical politics.\r\n\r\nThe economic situation of the two colonies is therefore composed of a\r\nnumber of perplexing oppositions. The one certain fact is the great\r\nhidden wealth. But to make those riches actual there must be labour,\r\nand, over and above any question of imported and indentured workmen,\r\nto secure labour there must be reasonable cheapness in the necessaries\r\nof life and work. Customs tariffs, railway rates, general taxation,\r\nmust all be calculated on a modest scale. But, on the other hand, if\r\nthe country is to advance to that civilisation which is its due, money\r\nmust be spent freely by the State on productive and unproductive\r\nenterprises; and in addition to such services, which are the basis of\r\nthe Guaranteed Loan, there is the War Debt, 30 millions of dead-weight\r\nround the neck of a struggling people. To pay the interest on debts\r\nand to provide money for day-to-day needs there must be revenue, and\r\nso there comes a point where direct and indirect charges, whatever the\r\ndemands of the situation, simply cannot be reduced further if the\r\nmechanism of Government is to continue in action. Heroic persons\r\nadvocate heroic remedies, such as the cessation of all enterprise in\r\nfavour of mining progress, or the renunciation of certain charges in\r\nfavour of cheap living. In one sense all politics are a gamble; but\r\nthere are limits beyond which statesmanship cannot go in the way of\r\nstaking everything on a chance, and yet hope to justify itself in the\r\neyes of the world in the event of failure. The real problem for the\r\nstatesman is not how to plunge wildly--it requires little skill to do\r\nthat--but how to adjust with nice discrimination. To preserve an\r\nadequate revenue, while at the same time giving ample play to the\r\nforces of production, is, in a word, the only policy which contains\r\nthe rudiments of ultimate success.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [15]  The latest information available on the subject of the\r\n        Transvaal gold mines will be found in the exhaustive\r\n        report prepared for Mr Chamberlain by the mining\r\n        engineers, and published at Johannesburg in 1903.\r\n\r\n  [16]  The following are some of the working costs of the mines.\r\n        Low costs: Geldenhuis Deep, 22s.; Geldenhuis Select,\r\n        17s. 6d.; Geldenhuis Main Reef, 17s. 4d.; Meyer and\r\n        Charlton, 18s. 2d.; Simmer and Jack, 20s. 7d. High\r\n        costs: City and Suburban, 29s. 1d.; Bonanza, 27s. 6d.;\r\n        Robinson Deep, 30s. 2d. The Robinson-Randfontein group\r\n        have ore of a gold value of 34s. 9d. per ton, and a\r\n        profit of 2s. over the working cost. The Bonanza has ore\r\n        worth L5 a-ton.\r\n\r\n  [17]  Imported labour reduces itself in practice to Chinese or\r\n        Japanese. Even supposing that the Indian Government\r\n        consented to the strict form of indenture necessary for\r\n        mining purposes, the political danger of introducing\r\n        coolie labour into a country which already contains a\r\n        considerable coolie population would be very great.\r\n\r\n  [18]  An argument often used in this connection is that the\r\n        employment of Asiatic labourers, repatriated at the end\r\n        of their contract, would mean that a very large sum of\r\n        money annually left the country. But the same thing will\r\n        happen if native African labour is brought from Central\r\n        or Western Africa or Somaliland. It is happening at\r\n        present with the natives from Portuguese territory, who\r\n        form 90 per cent of the existing labour-supply.\r\n\r\n  [19]  I have said elsewhere that there are few South African\r\n        problems which are not long-descended. The first\r\n        proposal to introduce Chinese labour was made by Jan van\r\n        Riebeck, the first Governor of Cape Colony, about the\r\n        year 1653. He urged the scheme with great persistence,\r\n        but home opinion proved too strong for him.\r\n\r\n  [20]  The cost of the acquisition of the present railway\r\n        systems was roughly 14 millions. This does not, of\r\n        course, represent an accurate statement of capital\r\n        outlay, as in the Orange Free State considerable sums\r\n        were spent out of State revenue. But even if we put the\r\n        figure at the outside limit of 20 millions, the net\r\n        profits are still more than 10 per cent of the capital\r\n        value.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a rough survey of the assets with which the new\r\ncolonies start on their career. As in all beginnings, a multitude of\r\nquestions protrude themselves. Every politician has his own nostrum,\r\nevery interest its own pressing demands. But the main questions are\r\nsimple, at least in their outlines, and it is permissible to\r\ndisentangle from the web the chief threads of economic policy. Three\r\npostulates there must be before a solvent and progressive nation can\r\nbe founded. In the first place, life must be made possible,--life on\r\nthe various scales which a civilised society demands. In the second\r\nplace, industries--the gold industry and the host of subsidiaries\r\nwhich must follow--should be given free scope for development by\r\nenlightened legislation, and the removal of burdens from the raw\r\nmaterial of progress. Finally, a sufficient revenue must be secured\r\nto meet the vast reproductive expenditure which the country demands.\r\nTo reconcile these three needs, which in practice often appear\r\ncontradictory, is the task of the new Government.\r\n\r\nTaking the three axioms as our guide, we have to consider the two\r\nquestions in all administration--the raising of revenue and the\r\napportionment of expenditure. Our inquiry into revenue must be chiefly\r\nconcerned with the Transvaal. The Orange River Colony is for the\r\npresent prosperous, and its future solvency seems assured. With a\r\ncertain income of half a million, and an expenditure of a little\r\nless, its fiscal problem is simplicity itself. But the Transvaal\r\npresents the case of a country with great potential wealth, which must\r\nborrow heavily to elicit its prosperity. Certain revenue-producing\r\ncharges must be cut down to make life on a proper scale possible, but\r\nrevenue must also be raised to make this life possible. It is the old\r\nstory of Egypt--taking out of one pocket to put into the other, with\r\nsomewhere behind the transaction an economic Providence to enhance\r\nvalues in the exchange. Such a policy is based upon a faith in the\r\nland, which by its productive power provides a natural sinking fund to\r\nwipe off encumbrances. Loans can be raised at 4 per cent, because the\r\ncountry repays a hundredfold.\r\n\r\nThe main items, exclusive of railways, which in the financial year\r\n1902-3 made up the revenue of the Transvaal, were customs revenue at\r\nupwards of two millions, mining revenue at half a million, stamp and\r\ntransfer duties at L720,000, taxes on trades and professions and post\r\nand telegraphs at a quarter of a million each, and native revenue at a\r\nlittle over L300,000. The total revenue was about L4,700,000. The\r\nestimated revenue for 1903-4 has been put at L4,500,000, made up of\r\ncustoms at L1,800,000, mining revenue at L750,000, post and telegraphs\r\nat L360,000, taxes on trades and professions at L200,000, native\r\nrevenue at L500,000, stamp and transfer duties at L700,000, and\r\nL200,000 for miscellaneous items. Since the object of the present\r\ninquiry is to estimate the financial position of the country, it is\r\nnecessary in the first place to take the various sources of revenue\r\none by one, and estimate their value and their defects. Several may at\r\nonce be omitted. Post and telegraphs barely pay for their working\r\nexpenses, and cannot be counted upon as a source of revenue. Stamp\r\nand transfer duties, stand licences and rent, and the bulk of the\r\nmiscellaneous items, are for the present static figures, or vary\r\nwithin narrow limits, and it is improbable that they will be altered\r\nso as to greatly increase their present revenue during the next few\r\nyears. Revenue questions for the Transvaal are concerned with two\r\nitems which far excel all others in importance--mining revenue and\r\ncustoms. There is a third, and the largest of the three, railway\r\nprofits; but, as will be explained later, this item has been excluded\r\nfrom the separate budgets of the two colonies.\r\n\r\nThe old mining revenue was mainly indirect. A tax on profits was\r\nindeed imposed by the late Government in February 1899, but war broke\r\nout before there was time to organise its collection. The real burden\r\nlay in the dynamite monopoly, which at its worst increased the price\r\nof explosives by L2 the case, and at its best by about 30s. The mines\r\nrequired an annual supply of 300,000 cases, which meant an annual\r\ncharge, beyond the cost of material, of L450,000. The average net\r\nprofits on the annual production of gold may be put at L6,000,000,\r\nwhich, with a 5 per cent profit tax, would return L300,000 a-year.\r\nHad the Boer _regime_ continued, the mining industry would have\r\ncontributed in the form of imposts something between L600,000 and\r\nL750,000 per annum (for a reduction of 10s. in the dynamite charge\r\nhad been promised on the eve of the war). From the standpoint of the\r\nmines the whole sum was an impost, but only the yield from the profit\r\ntax would have found its way into the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe present charges on the mining industry consist of the prospectors'\r\nand diggers' licences, the 10 per cent tax on profits, imposed by\r\nProclamation No. 34 of 1902, and the cost of native passes, which was\r\nformerly paid by the native himself, but is now borne by the employer.\r\nThe mining industry will therefore on its present basis pay from half\r\na million upwards in profit tax, about L120,000 for native passes, and\r\nabout L50,000 in licences. It is difficult to see how this taxation\r\ncould be fairly increased. To add, for example, a charge of 20s. per\r\ncase to explosives would be to tax the means of production,--a fatal\r\nheresy,--to keep some of the smaller mines out of the profit-making\r\nclass, and in the long-run to harm the Exchequer itself. The true\r\npolicy is not to hamper the earning of profits by excessive charges,\r\nbut to enlarge by judicious encouragement the area over which profits\r\nare made. It is of the first importance that European capital should\r\nbe attracted to, and not scared away from, the country. Under the\r\npresent system the Government receipts will advance _pari passu_ with\r\nany increase in the prosperity of the mines, and to secure the\r\nultimate gain one may well be satisfied to forego a larger immediate\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth source of revenue from mining enterprise which may\r\nbe roughly described as windfalls. The Government has a moral right,\r\nwhich no one denies, to profit by new discoveries, and in any case, as\r\na large landowner, it will be interested as an immediate participant.\r\nThe provisions of the old Gold Law have been so often discussed in\r\nprint that it is sufficient here to give the briefest sketch of them.\r\nLegislation by the late Government on precious minerals began as\r\nearly as 1858, and continued in a long series of resolutions and\r\ncounter-resolutions till the somewhat confused position of affairs\r\nwas simplified and regulated by the famous law, No. 15 of 1898. The\r\nbasis of this law is to be found in the principle that to the owner\r\nbelonged the ownership of minerals found under his land, but to the\r\nState the right of regulating their disposal. It attempted to give to\r\nboth owner and State a fair share of the proceeds, while at the same\r\ntime the prospector and discoverer received a moderate reward for\r\ntheir enterprise. There can be no question about the validity of the\r\nthree rights; the only dispute is concerned with their relative\r\nproportions. Besides the matter of share, there is one other question\r\nof great importance--how far it is permissible for an owner to refuse\r\nto allow the exploital of minerals under his land.\r\n\r\nI take the last question first. Under the old law the owner of private\r\nproperty could prospect without a licence on his own land, and could\r\ngive authority to any licensed person. If minerals were found, the\r\nState President, subject to certain compensation, could throw open the\r\nland as a public diggings. State land could be prospected and\r\nproclaimed in exactly the same way. But if the owner of private land\r\nrefused to prospect himself or allow others to prospect, the State\r\ncould not interfere to compel the exploital of his minerals. Much has\r\nbeen said of the right of the public in the shape of the prospector to\r\ngo anywhere in his search; but no such _right_ has ever existed or can\r\nexist. The whole question is one of policy. It is clearly not the\r\ninterest of the State to leave the chief source of its wealth\r\nunworked; nor in any real sense is it the interest of the private\r\nowner. But it would be an intolerable burden to a farmer to be\r\nsubjected to constant trespass by any prospector who cared to take out\r\na licence. We must, however, clearly distinguish between Crown and\r\nprivate land, so far as the steps towards the discovery of the\r\nminerals are concerned. Crown land, under strict conditions, should be\r\nfree to any licensed prospector; but, as the settlement of Crown land\r\nby agricultural tenants is a vital part of Government policy,\r\nprovision must be made for ample compensation to such a tenant for\r\ndisturbance caused by prospecting. Such provision should refer not\r\nonly to unproclaimed or hereafter to be proclaimed Crown land, but\r\nshould be brought to cover areas such as Barberton, Lydenberg, and the\r\nWood Bush, which have been long working gold-fields. If compensation\r\nand security is not provided, some of the most valuable agricultural\r\nand pastoral lands in the country will be incapable of white\r\nsettlement, and their only occupants will be the Kaffir, the coolie,\r\nand the bywoner, who have no interest in creating permanent homes. It\r\nis undesirable to tie up minerals, but it is equally undesirable to\r\ntie up agricultural wealth. People have talked of proclamation as if\r\nit were an inviolable contract between the Crown and the public, to\r\nwhich no new conditions could be added. There is neither legal nor\r\nhistorical justification for this view. It is right for the Crown,\r\nhaving given permission to the public to go upon its lands for a\r\nparticular purpose, to impose from time to time conditions under which\r\nthe permission may be exercised. On private lands the case is\r\ndifferent. No owner of a private farm who is in beneficial occupation\r\nof it (when he is not, the land should be treated for this purpose as\r\nCrown land) should be compelled to allow prospecting unless he has\r\nalready himself prospected or given authority to others. To enact\r\notherwise would be to make a freehold title little more than a farce.\r\nBut in order to prevent a reactionary or indolent owner from tying up\r\nvaluable minerals for an indefinite time, when there are reasonable\r\ngrounds for believing that such minerals exist, the Commissioner of\r\nMines should have the power to give notice to the owner that he must\r\nprospect or allow others to do so, and, if he still refuses, to issue\r\nto the public a small number of prospecting licences on the property.\r\nWhen prospecting has taken place, and, after an investigation by the\r\nGovernment, minerals are found to exist in payable quantities, the\r\narea, subject to all rights of compensation, should be proclaimed a\r\npublic digging.\r\n\r\nUnder the old law the discoverer, if his discovery were made at least\r\nsix miles distant from a locality already worked, was entitled to mark\r\noff six claims which he could work without payment of licence-moneys.\r\nHe had also the ordinary public right of pegging off not more than\r\nfifty claims in the proclaimed area, and fifty additional claims on\r\npayment of reduced licences. The only real reward to the prospector\r\nfor his trouble and expense was the six free claims--hardly a\r\nsufficient inducement to undertake laborious, and often costly,\r\nenterprises. The Gold Law Commission recommended that the discoverer\r\nshould receive one-thirtieth of the proclaimed area, provided that in\r\nno case such one-thirtieth exceeded thirty claims. This seems a\r\nreasonable but not extravagant honorarium to the pioneer. He would be\r\nentitled to the first selection, and would hold his claims free of\r\nlicence-moneys till they reached the producing stage.\r\n\r\nThe owner, under the old law, was entitled to reserve a _mynpacht_,\r\nequal to one-tenth of the proclaimed area, for which he paid either\r\n10s. per morgen per annum or 2-1/2 per cent of his gross profits. He\r\nwas also entitled to mark off a _werf_ or homestead area, on which\r\nprospecting was forbidden; and on this, too, he could claim a\r\n_mynpacht_ from the State. He was entitled to a certain number of\r\nowner's claims, which could not exceed ten. He was entitled, before\r\nproclamation, to grant to other persons a certain number of claims\r\ncalled _vergunnings_. Finally, he was entitled to share equally with\r\nthe Government in all licence-moneys on claims, and to receive a share,\r\nvarying from one-half to three-fourths, of all licence-moneys on\r\nstands. This system gave the owner about one-sixth of the whole\r\nproclaimed area,--an extravagant share, and one complicated by the\r\ncurious rights into which it was divided. Such unmeaning complexity\r\nmust be abolished, and one form of title--claim licences--substituted.\r\n_Werf_ and _vergunning_ claims should be done away with, and the owner,\r\nas the Commission recommended, be allowed to peg out one-seventh of the\r\nproclaimed area, which should take the place of _werf_, _mynpacht_,\r\n_vergunnings_, and owner's claims. The Commission has also recommended\r\nthat, while the owner should retain half of the proceeds of licences,\r\nthe Crown should have the right, without consulting him, to remit or\r\nreduce the licence-moneys in what appear to be deserving cases.\r\n\r\nThe State, under the old law, received all licence-moneys on claims\r\nand stands situated on State lands, and half the licence-moneys from\r\nclaims and stands on private lands. It received also certain payments\r\nfrom the owners of _mynpachts_. This in itself should provide for a\r\nconsiderable revenue. But in addition the Crown should have the right\r\nof sale of claims in proved districts, where the ground has a certain\r\nvalue. The former method, in places where pegging was out of the\r\nquestion, such as along the Main Reef, was to hold a claims' lottery,\r\na method which was neither rational nor lucrative. The sale by\r\nauction of claims in proved districts would bring in a large\r\nadditional revenue and do no injustice to the prospector. But in all\r\nplaces yet unproved the public should be free to peg out claims and\r\ntry their fortune. It is important, also, to revise the present system\r\nof licence-moneys, so as to make the licences small during the\r\nprospecting and non-producing period, and raise them when mining\r\nactually begins. Under the old law all licences were L1 per claim per\r\nmonth, a payment which bore heavily upon the poor prospector who was\r\nstill labouring to prove his claim. Prospectors' licences were issued\r\nat 5s. per month on private land and 2s. 6d. on Government land. The\r\nCommission recommended the abolition of prospectors' licences, and the\r\nsubstitution of one general licence to search for minerals, on which a\r\nstamp duty of 2s. 6d. per month should be charged. When minerals are\r\nfound and a public digging has been proclaimed, licence-moneys of 2s.\r\n6d. per claim per month should be paid on Government land, and 5s. on\r\nprivate land till the producing stage is reached. After that date the\r\nold licence of L1 would come into force.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal Legislature will shortly be called upon to consider a\r\nnew Gold Law based on the report of the Commission, of which I have\r\nsketched the chief features. Of almost equal importance, in the light\r\nof recent discoveries, is the new Diamond Law, where substantially the\r\nsame questions of principle are involved. Owner, discoverer, and State\r\nshould have a fair share of profit--but especially the State. We are\r\nnone too well off in the ordinary course of things to be able to\r\nafford to neglect our windfalls. A serious and permanent increase of\r\nrevenue can come only from a gradual increase of producing activity;\r\nbut, apart from permanent needs, many occasions will arise for capital\r\nexpenditure in reproductive works which are vital to progress. A\r\nwindfall is a development loan without guarantee or interest or\r\nsinking fund to burden the mind of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other direct taxes are so few and unimportant that they may safely\r\nbe neglected. But it is necessary to face the question of adjustment\r\nand new taxation, for the time may come when it may be expedient to\r\nlower many of the existing duties and to revise thoroughly railway\r\nrates, and it is desirable to have alternative proposals to meet the\r\ndecline of revenue which will follow. It may be desirable, for\r\ninstance, to abolish wholly the present charge on dynamite, as it most\r\ncertainly will be necessary to lower still further the cost of transit\r\non the railways. But new taxation must be imposed with the greatest\r\ncaution. The present population of the Transvaal pays in indirect\r\ntaxes L10 a-head as against L2 at home; the field for direct taxation\r\nis therefore strictly circumscribed. To certain taxes the road is\r\nbarred. A land tax, however light, would bear heavily upon the\r\nimpoverished rural districts, and in any case is impossible under the\r\nTerms of Surrender. An income tax would make life unbearable if the\r\nlimit of exemption were low, and if the limit were high the yield\r\nwould be inconsiderable. A general profit tax on the earnings of both\r\ncompanies and individuals may become feasible in time, but we must\r\nfirst await the return of normal conditions of life. One way may be\r\nfound in increased native taxation, a matter which, as it is bound up\r\nwith other questions of native policy, is discussed in another\r\nchapter. But the object of all new taxation must be to strike at the\r\nuntaxed and unproductive elements in society, for reasons quite as\r\nmuch political as economic. On this ground two taxes seem just and\r\ndesirable, though there are certain obvious difficulties to be\r\nsurmounted before they can be levied. The first is a tax upon\r\nunoccupied lands, a quite possible and equitable tax which would meet\r\nwith little real opposition. Land companies in the Transvaal alone\r\npossess some 12 million acres, the bulk of which has been bought for\r\nsupposed mineral values. Not 10 per cent of the land is occupied, and\r\nnearly 50 per cent is capable of occupation of some kind. Quite apart\r\nfrom revenue considerations, a tax which would compel settlement, or,\r\nfailing that, would drive some of the more obstinate companies to put\r\ngood land in the market, would be sound policy. What applies to the\r\ncompanies would apply to the private landowner who has his half-dozen\r\nfarms, and lives in a corner of one of them. _Latifundia_ bid fair to\r\nbe among the curses of the land, unless proper measures are taken to\r\ncheck them in time; and if this is done, the land troubles of the\r\nAustralian colonies and their confiscatory legislation will be saved\r\nto South Africa. The machinery would be simple. A permanent commission\r\nwould have to be established (the judicial committee of the Central\r\nLand Board, provided for in the Settler's Ordinance, could do the\r\nwork). Each owner of unoccupied land would be summoned before it to\r\nstate his case. He might show that three-fourths of his land was at\r\nthe moment incapable of occupation, in which case he would only be\r\nassessed on the remainder. The tax might be an _ad valorem_ tax of 2\r\nor 3 per cent. A day might be fixed, say eighteen months from\r\nassessment, when the tax would come into operation. In case owners\r\nproved refractory and preferred to pay the tax, it might be increased\r\non a sliding scale till settlement became compulsory. There would be\r\nno hardship to company or individual, since only land for which a\r\nwhite occupier could be found would be assessable for the purpose. The\r\nsecond tax is of equal importance but far greater complexity. The most\r\ndifficult person to reach in taxation is the holder for the rise, the\r\nspeculator who is nothing else, the great class which toils and spins\r\nnot and grows fat on the energy of others. The basis of his activity\r\nis the quotation of shares, and a tax to affect him must be in\r\nrelation to such market values. You cannot introduce a too cumbrous\r\nmachinery without acting in restraint of legitimate trade, quite apart\r\nfrom the fact that most of the business is done with bearer shares\r\nwhich pass through fifty hands before registration. But it might be\r\npossible--it is a problem for a revenue expert to decide--to affect\r\nthis class indirectly and curtail its activity by a tax on the profits\r\nof companies based on the average quotation for the preceding year. At\r\nthe best it would be only a half measure, for it would be limited to\r\ndividend-paying companies, and the energies of the middleman are\r\nchiefly exercised on companies whose profits are still wholly\r\nspeculative. But with all deductions there seems to be a chance of\r\nrevenue in such a tax, and a certain general economic value. The tax,\r\nagain, would be limited to new issues, for in the case of old issues,\r\neven when the shares stand at 1000 per cent premium, a high dividend\r\nmay represent a very moderate dividend on the capital of the investor\r\nwho bought in when shares were high. If the dividend of a new issue\r\njustified a high quotation, the quotation would be high in spite of\r\nthe tax, but the existence of the tax would tend to keep down the\r\nspeculative quotation to some reasonable relation to former dividends.\r\nIf dividends declined, and the quotation fell, the tax would go\r\nautomatically out of existence. Such a tax, if possible, would not\r\nyield in normal years a great revenue, but it would have certain\r\nsalutary and permanent effects. It would touch companies only in a\r\nhigh state of prosperity. It would indirectly touch the man who buys\r\nnot for dividends but to realise by taking away in some part the basis\r\nof his speculations. It would exercise a steadying influence upon the\r\nmarket, and prevent, at least in one class of security, fictitious\r\nrises. But as a means of revenue its position would be really that of\r\na windfall, for it would enable the Crown to profit largely out of any\r\nperiod of great financial excitement. A boom, so eagerly desired by\r\nall but in many of its results so maleficent, might be delayed by its\r\nagency; and if it came, as no doubt it would in spite of any ingenious\r\ntaxation, and share values became blindly inflated irrespective of\r\npast or present dividends, the Government would perform that rarest of\r\nfeats, and derive an honest profit from the vices of the multitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal, till the other day, was the only important South\r\nAfrican state not included in the Customs Union. Its customs law was\r\nNo. 4 of 1894, amended by Ordinance 22 of 1902. The basis was an _ad\r\nvalorem_ tax of 7-1/2 per cent on all goods brought across the border,\r\nwith an addition of 20 per cent to the valuation price for the purpose\r\nof the tax in the case of goods directly imported from over-sea. The\r\npurpose of this provision is obvious, since to goods bought at the\r\ncoast the cost of over-sea freightage and handling is added in\r\nreaching the price on which the tax is assessed. But to this general\r\nduty there were two important exceptions. There was a lengthy free\r\nlist, which included, in addition to goods imported for Government\r\nuse, all live stock, books, tree, flower, and vegetable seeds and\r\nplants, tools and effects of immigrant mechanics, fencing material,\r\nmining and agricultural machinery, cement, and unmanufactured woods.\r\nThere was also a list on which, in addition to the general 7-1/2 per\r\ncent, special duties were charged. Beer paid 3s. per gallon, dynamite\r\n9d. per pound, gunpowder 6d. per pound, spirits from 14s. to L1 per\r\nimperial gallon, manufactured tobacco 3s. per pound, leaf-tobacco 2s.\r\nper pound (when brought from over-sea), wine from 4s. to 12s. 6d. per\r\ngallon. The tariff was therefore moderately protectionist. Most\r\narticles necessary for the great industries were free; articles of\r\ncommon use were subject only to the _ad valorem_ duty; while articles\r\nof luxury, and especially all fermented liquors, were subject to a\r\nfair but not excessive special tax.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was that the tariff was not a fair guide to the real\r\ntaxation of imports. The Transvaal has no seacoast; all her imports\r\nhave to be landed at the ports of other colonies or states, and\r\ncarried to her borders by alien railways. Moreover, all the seaboard\r\ncolonies, as well as the Orange River Colony, were banded together in\r\na Customs Union, from which she was excluded. A tariff hostility was\r\ntherefore smouldering on, which gave acute annoyance to the Transvaal\r\nimporter. I will take two instances of purely predatory imposts. The\r\ncoast colonies levied a so-called transit due of 3 per cent on\r\ndutiable articles for the Transvaal, a due which was the same in\r\nprinciple as the levies which the barons of the Rhine used to make\r\nfrom the harmless merchants passing through their borders. Again, in\r\nthe case of the Orange River Colony, the only inland colony in the old\r\nCustoms Union, the duties were collected at the coast ports, and a\r\ncollecting charge was made, which was simply another form of the\r\ntransit due. At one time the charge was as high as 25 per cent of the\r\nduties collected; but on the petition of the Orange River Colony it\r\nwas afterwards reduced to 15 per cent. How far such a rate was from\r\nrepresenting the real cost of collection is shown by the fact that the\r\nTransvaal duties were collected by the coast colonies from the\r\noccupation of Pretoria to the end of 1901 at a charge of only 2-1/2\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal had thus a tariff in itself reasonable, but she was\r\nembarrassed by her isolation. It was obviously desirable that she\r\nshould enter into the Customs Union, which would then comprise the\r\nwhole of South Africa, for if federation is ever to become a serious\r\npolicy it is well to begin by throwing down economic barriers. But\r\neconomics have an awkward way of overriding all other considerations,\r\nand the entrance of the Transvaal into the Union could only be a\r\nmatter of hard business--give and take on both sides. The interest of\r\nthe two parties was on this matter far apart. The coast colonies are\r\nagricultural and pastoral, and their ports are forwarding depots. They\r\nare frankly protectionist, and their customs have always been their\r\nchief source of revenue. The Transvaal is industrial, and for the\r\npresent a free-trader; she must have cheap food, cheap raw material,\r\ncheap necessaries. While at the moment customs form the largest item\r\nin her revenue, it does not overshadow all others, and in time it is\r\nprobable that it will sink to a second place. The question was,\r\ntherefore, What of her present tariff would the Transvaal relinquish\r\nto meet the wishes of the Union, and what compensating advantages\r\ncould she expect from her membership?\r\n\r\nThe Bloemfontein Conference of March 1903 prepared a Customs\r\nConvention, which has since been ratified by the several states, and\r\nthe old Customs Union has been amended and extended to include the\r\nwhole of British South Africa. How far has this act improved the\r\neconomic position of the Transvaal? In the first place, there is one\r\nsolid gain, the abolition of the transit dues, estimated at between\r\nL250,000 and L300,000 per annum. There is, too, a gain in the mere fact\r\nof union, and the freedom which it gives from the incessant bickerings\r\nof conflicting tariffs. Since her duties are collected by the coast\r\ncolonies at the moderate charge of 5 per cent, a saving may also be\r\neffected by the reduction of the customs establishment on her borders.\r\nThe benefit which she has conferred in return is the opening of her\r\nmarkets without restraint to the products of British South Africa, an\r\nopening which should amply repay the coast colonies for the reduction\r\nin the protective tariff from over-sea. The actual tariff charges are\r\nin the nature of an elaborate compromise. To take first the case of the\r\nsimple food-stuffs. In 1898, under the old Transvaal tariff, imported\r\nflour paid in duty L26,955, and imported mealies L16,290. Under the old\r\nUnion tariff they would have paid respectively L114,068 and L69,332--a\r\ndifference of over 400 per cent. The old Union rate was 2s. per 100 lb.\r\nfor grain and 4s. 6d. per 100 lb. for flour, while the old Transvaal\r\nrate was an _ad valorem_ duty of about 9 per cent. It was impossible\r\nthat either party could accept the other's rate, so the present\r\nsolution of 1s. for grain and 2s. for flour may be taken as a\r\nsatisfactory compromise, which an industrial country could support. It\r\nmust be further remembered that all food-stuffs produced elsewhere in\r\nSouth Africa enter free, and that the cost of bread under the new\r\nsystem will be if anything reduced. Article XV. of the Convention gives\r\nthe Transvaal a further power in times of scarcity to suspend the duty\r\non food-stuffs altogether, and give a bonus to imports of the same\r\nclass produced in the neighbouring colonies. The ordinary manufactured\r\narticle, which in a non-manufacturing country plays as large a part in\r\nthe cost of living as bread, is also reduced for the purchaser. It pays\r\nan _ad valorem_ duty of 10 per cent, which at first sight seems higher\r\nthan the old rate of 7-1/2, which with other charges worked out in\r\npractice at about 9. But 2-1/2 per cent must be deducted on account of\r\nthe 25 per cent preferential rate for British goods, and with the\r\nabolition of the transit dues the actual duty will work out at between\r\n7 and 8 per cent. Raw material and the necessaries of industry remain\r\nmuch where they were under the old tariff, which was highly favourable\r\nto them; but the charge on dynamite has been reduced from 9d. a-pound\r\nto 1-1/2d., which is a reduction of over 30s. on the 50-lb. case.\r\n\r\nA mere comparison of tariffs does not show the real cheapening of the\r\nnecessaries of life; for to get at the practical effect, the abolition\r\nof the transit dues, the reduction of railway rates, amounting to at\r\nleast L300,000 per annum, and the preference rate on British goods,\r\nmust all be considered. Under the old tariff and railway rates every\r\n100 lb. of flour from Port Elizabeth to the Transvaal paid 9d. to the\r\nTransvaal in duty. The freight was 6s. 2d., so that it paid altogether\r\nin charges 6s. 11d. Under the Convention the same quantity of flour\r\nwill pay 2s. in duty and 3s. 9d. in railway rates, so that, in spite\r\nof the higher duty, the charge is only 5s. 9d.,--a saving to the\r\nTransvaal consumer of 1s. 2d., and a gain to the Transvaal treasury of\r\n1s. 3d. There are many instances of a similar kind. Ordinary groceries\r\nwill be reduced by about 3 per cent, paraffin by 1s. 6d. a case,\r\ngrease by 2s. 6d. per 100 lb., cement by 2s. 9d. a cask. Tea and\r\ncoffee, on the other hand, show a slight increase. In one branch there\r\nis a very marked increase, and an exception to the inter-colonial free\r\ntrade, which is the basis of the Convention. Each party to the Union\r\nis entitled to levy on the importation of spirits distilled in and\r\nfrom the produce of places within the Union a duty equal to any excise\r\nduty which it may levy on spirits made within its own borders. In the\r\nTransvaal there is no excise, for the manufacture of spirits is wholly\r\nforbidden. It is of the most urgent importance to keep fermented\r\nliquors out of reach of the native population, and to suppress all\r\nillicit traffic. The importation of Portuguese spirits has been\r\nstopped by treaty, and it was clearly impossible for the Transvaal to\r\nconsent to the importation of spirits on easier terms from the other\r\nBritish colonies. The concluding paragraph of Article XVII.,\r\ntherefore, provides that \"where a prohibition exists in any colony or\r\nterritory of the Union against the manufacture of spirits for sale, it\r\nshall be lawful for such colony or territory to levy on spirits\r\nproduced within the Union a custom duty not exceeding that levied on\r\nsimilar spirits produced outside the Union.\" The duty in force is\r\ntherefore from 15s. to L1 per imperial gallon in addition to the 10\r\nper cent _ad valorem_ rate; which, it has been calculated, is an\r\nincrease on the former cost of from 4s. to 6s. per case.\r\n\r\nThe new Union is therefore almost wholly in the favour of the new\r\ncolonies. The cost to the consumer is lessened, but the revenue does\r\nnot lose appreciably, since charges, formerly diverted by the coast\r\ncolonies, now go to its coffers. The coast colonies, in an admirable\r\nspirit of statesmanship, have consented to surrender a part of their\r\nrevenue in order that the chief industrial market of South Africa\r\nmight be open to their people--an example of that policy of foregoing\r\ncertain revenues on a narrow basis for the sake of a possible revenue\r\nin a wider field which is of the essence of good government. The\r\npreference given to British goods, while still further reducing rates\r\nin favour of a large class of imports, is also a step towards\r\nfederation, which does not, as such experiments are apt to do,\r\nmilitate in any serious way against local commerce. The one person who\r\nmight complain is the farmer of the Transvaal, who sees his markets\r\nthrown open to the old grain-lands of Cape Colony; but if the long\r\nrailway journey which his rivals have to face is not a sufficient\r\nhandicap to enable him to hold his own, then we need not lament his\r\nfall. Vital as agricultural progress is, it cannot hope for protection\r\nat the expense of industrial prosperity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe normal expenditure of the Transvaal may be taken roughly at\r\nL3,600,000. This figure is exclusive of debt charges, or any capital\r\noutlay on development which may be met out of revenue. It represents\r\nmerely the day-to-day cost of the administrative machine. As revenue\r\nis enlarged the expenditure will follow suit; but it is unlikely that\r\nthe proportion of costs to receipts, which is roughly three to four,\r\nwill ever increase. On the contrary, it might be considerably reduced\r\nby a more complete administrative decentralisation. At present there\r\nare a number of isolated departments--Native Affairs, Lands,\r\nMines--with local representatives wholly independent of each other,\r\nand responsible only to the heads of their departments. The resident\r\nmagistrate, who is really an administrative official, since the legal\r\nwork is done by the assistant magistrate, and who as a rule is not a\r\nlawyer, has a very narrow control over a few subjects like local\r\ngovernment and public health. The system is wasteful both of money and\r\nenergy, for the isolated departments often overlap unconsciously; and\r\nsince there is no local check, the tendency is for the head of a\r\ndepartment to increase his local staff and to vie with other heads in\r\nsecuring large estimates. It also means that a constant inspection has\r\nto be kept up from headquarters, and each department supports a force\r\nof travelling officials. The Indian precedent might be followed with\r\nadvantage, and real heads of districts established, who would have a\r\ncontrol, direct or indirect, over all administrative work. They should\r\nbe responsible for the efficient and economic working of their\r\ndistrict, prepare their local estimates and reports, and answer for\r\ntheir work only to the Governor and Council. The great departments\r\nwould exist as before, but their local staffs would be much reduced\r\nin number, so far as such staffs were administrative and not\r\nintrusted with expert work. Experts, such as inspectors of machinery,\r\ncustoms officers, and veterinary surgeons, would remain directly\r\nresponsible to their own departments, though over these also the\r\ndistrict administrator would exercise a general supervision. In this\r\nway a very considerable saving would be effected in salaries, the\r\nunnecessarily large force of travelling inspectors could be reduced,\r\nand the friction which inevitably attends the working of isolated\r\nand independent officials in any district would be saved by the\r\nestablishment of responsible heads,--deputy administrators, whose\r\nbusiness it would be to supervise all district Government work, and\r\ncontrol all local expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe natural assets of the country and the existing fiscal system have\r\nbeen roughly sketched in the foregoing pages. It remains to consider\r\nwhat burden these two factors in collaboration are called upon to bear.\r\nIn view of the peculiar situation of the new colonies, the necessity of\r\na loan for development is sufficiently obvious. The country was\r\ndesolated by war. Large sums were necessary for compensation to\r\nloyalists and for the repatriation of the Dutch inhabitants. The\r\nbackward system of our predecessors had left public works ill provided\r\nfor in most places, particularly in the country districts. If the\r\nwealth of the provinces, mineral and agricultural, was to be exploited,\r\nand the existing industries granted reasonable facilities for progress,\r\na heavy expenditure was imperative for railway extension. If the rural\r\nparts were to be developed and their population leavened with our own\r\ncountrymen, considerable sums must be expended on settlement, and on\r\nsuch reproductive schemes as forestry and irrigation. Finally, certain\r\nheavy liabilities awaited the incoming Government. To buy out the\r\nexisting railways and repay certain military debts and advances from\r\nthe Imperial Treasury, fully 14 millions were required. The old debt of\r\nthe Transvaal, amounting to 2-1/2 millions, which carried 4 per cent\r\ninterest, must be paid off, and the capital required for the repayment\r\nmade part of a new loan at an easier rate. The liabilities and needs\r\nof the country stood therefore as follows: An advance by the Imperial\r\nGovernment to cover the estimated Transvaal deficit of 1901-2,\r\nL1,500,000; the old debt of the Transvaal, L2,500,000; compensation to\r\nloyalists in Cape Colony and Natal, L2,000,000; the acquisition of the\r\nrailways and the repayment of the existing railway debt, L14,000,000;\r\nrepatriation[21] and compensation in the new colonies, L5,000,000;\r\nrailway extension, L5,000,000; land settlement, L3,000,000; various\r\npublic works, L2,000,000,--a total of L35,000,000. This is the sum\r\ncomprised in the famous Guaranteed Loan.\r\n\r\nBut this figure, large as it is, does not exhaust our burden. During\r\nthe year 1901 and 1902 the question of the contribution of the new\r\ncolonies to the imperial war debt was keenly discussed both in South\r\nAfrica and in England. Some fixed the payment likely to be required at\r\nas much as L100,000,000; others argued that the new colonies were\r\nlikely to have so many burdens of their own that they could not be\r\ncalled upon to contribute at all. Moderate men on both sides saw that\r\nsome contribution was equitable, but asked that it should not be fixed\r\nso high as to cripple development. There were various proposals, such\r\nas the ear-marking of certain sources of revenue and all windfalls, or\r\nthe allocating of a certain proportion of any annual surplus; but such\r\nschemes were liable to the objection from the side of the Imperial\r\nGovernment that there was no certainty in the contribution, and from\r\nthe side of the new colonies that there was no finality in the\r\nliability. The settlement which Mr Chamberlain announced in his speech\r\nat Johannesburg in January 1903 was, perhaps, the best possible in\r\nthe circumstances. The contribution was fixed at L30,000,000, to be\r\nraised in three years by contributions of L10,000,000 per annum. The\r\nfirst 10 millions at 4 per cent were underwritten without commission\r\nby the great financial houses of the Rand, and there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that if they are called to make good their guarantee, it will\r\nprove a profitable investment. It is difficult to overestimate the\r\nmerit of an arrangement which tends to bind the great houses to a\r\ncloser interest in the general development of the country. The War\r\nLoan was secured wholly upon the Transvaal, but there is a contingent\r\nliability on the Orange River Colony to pay a further sum of\r\nL5,000,000 out of the Government share of any discoveries of precious\r\nstones and metals.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, to face a total debt of L65,000,000, of which 35\r\nmillions at 3 per cent are a charge upon both colonies, and 30\r\nmillions at 4 per cent upon the Transvaal alone. It is a heavy\r\nresponsibility for a white population of a few hundreds of thousands,\r\nface to face with a labour problem. That the world at large believes\r\nin the future of the country is shown by the way in which the\r\nGuaranteed Loan was taken up, the first 30 millions having been\r\nsubscribed more than thirty times over. On this loan the interest\r\ncharge, with 1 per cent sinking fund, will amount to an annual\r\npayment of L1,400,000: in three years time the War Loan, unless (which\r\nis probable) it can be issued at a lower rate than 4 per cent, will\r\nmean an annual charge of L1,200,000, with no sinking fund allowed. We\r\nhave therefore in front of us a possible annual payment of L2,600,000,\r\nwith a slight increase in the future when a sinking fund is provided.\r\nThe payment, large in itself, was made more difficult by the\r\ncircumstances of the two colonies. The larger loan is secured on both,\r\nbut while the Orange River Colony had a fair claim to a considerable\r\npart of the proceeds, it was clearly impossible that she should pay a\r\nshare of the charge proportionate to her receipts. If she shared in\r\nthe loan only to the extent of the annual contribution which on her\r\nsmall revenue she could afford, many important public works both of\r\nland settlement and railway extension would have to be abandoned.\r\nJoined with this general administrative difficulty, there was a\r\ndepartmental one connected with the railways. The main line through\r\nthe Orange River Colony had acquired, as one of the main feeders of\r\nthe Transvaal, a purely fictitious value, and the Orange River Colony\r\nprofited greatly by the receipts. But to have within one system two\r\ntypes of line, one a through line simply, the other connected directly\r\nwith the great centres of production and consumption, and to have\r\nthose two types of lines used as revenue-producing agents for two\r\ndifferent administrations, was to make a consistent railway policy\r\nimpossible. The country of the through line, whose fictitious value\r\nproduced a very real revenue, would reclaim against reduction in rates\r\nfor the benefit of the other.\r\n\r\nBoth difficulties have been met by a very ingenious scheme. The\r\nInter-Colonial Council of the two colonies, created by Order in\r\nCouncil of 20th May 1903, is significant in many ways, notably as the\r\nfirst overt step towards federation; but for the present we may look\r\nupon it purely as a financial expedient. Two important departments,\r\ncommon to both colonies, were placed wholly under the administration\r\nof the Council--the Central South African Railways and the South\r\nAfrican Constabulary; and a number of minor common services, such as\r\nsurveys and education, were added, and power was given to the two\r\nlegislatures to increase the number when they saw fit. A Railway\r\nCommittee of Council forms the permanent controlling authority in all\r\nrailway matters. All net profits of the railways in each year are\r\nassigned to Council to form its revenues. Out of these it has to meet\r\nthe expenditure of the Constabulary and the minor common charges, as\r\nwell as the annual charge and management costs of the Guaranteed\r\nLoan.[22]\r\n\r\nThe financial duties of the Council are therefore twofold. It has the\r\nentire administration of the Loan in its hands, it provides for its\r\napportionment among the different services, and it undertakes the\r\npayment of its charges. It has also to meet the administrative\r\nexpenditure of the common departments intrusted to it, and for this\r\npurpose it receives the net profits of the chief revenue-producing\r\nasset of the two Governments. The first duty is comparatively simple.\r\nA body composed of official and unofficial representatives of the two\r\nparties to the Loan can allocate speedily and equitably without the\r\nconstant strife and jealousy which would attend the interference of\r\ntwo different publics. But the second duty, which is concerned with\r\nthe annual inter-colonial budget, constitutes the index or barometer\r\nof the new colony finances. The Budget for 1903-4 shows the following\r\nfigures: on the revenue side, L2,350,000 from the net railway\r\nreceipts; on the expenditure side, L1,441,000 for the service of the\r\nGuaranteed Loan,[23] L1,520,000 for the Constabulary, and about\r\nL70,000 for minor common services. This leaves a deficit of about\r\nL680,000, which, according to the term of the Order in Council, will\r\nbe met by contributions from the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony\r\nin proportion to their customs receipts--roughly, L600,000 from the\r\nfirst, and L80,000 from the second.\r\n\r\nLet us take the revenue side of the Budget first. The position of the\r\nrailways is anomalous. They are virtually a taxing-machine, and in\r\nthis respect the most effective of Government properties. The normal\r\nposition of a Government railway should be that of an institution\r\nworked for the public benefit, the receipts being little in excess of\r\nthe working costs plus a moderate interest on the capital involved. In\r\nthis railway system the net profits, as we have seen, are estimated\r\nfor next year, allowing for the half-million decrease from the\r\nreduction of rates, at L2,300,000. No doubt it is economically unsound\r\nto levy a tax of such magnitude on what is virtually a necessity of\r\nlife and a constituent of production. But bad economics may be sound\r\nstatesmanship, if they are recognised as unsound--a temporary\r\nexpedient to obviate a more serious difficulty. Railway profits are\r\nthe buttress of inter-colonial finance: without them there is no\r\nsatisfactory provision for the debt charges, and some form of direct\r\ntaxation, which would interfere far more effectively with nascent\r\nindustries, would be the only resort. The rates have been already\r\nreduced so as to provide, along with the new customs tariff, for a\r\nvery real decrease in the cost of living. They will be still further\r\nreduced, always keeping a limit in view which is calculated on fiscal\r\nneeds. To so adjust the rates that industrial and rural development\r\nwill not be hindered, and at the same time to provide an adequate\r\nrevenue, presents a very pretty problem in railway finance. It is the\r\nproblem in the customs; it is the problem in direct taxation; it is\r\nthe essence of the economic problem of the country. But with all\r\nreductions there is a good chance of railway revenue increasing. The 5\r\nmillions of the Loan which go to development will in a year or two\r\nbear fruit. It is difficult to see how the net profits can ever fall\r\nbelow L2,100,000, while it is not unreasonable to hope that in a few\r\nyears they may rise to L2,500,000 or L3,000,000.\r\n\r\nBut while the revenue side is likely to increase, the expenditure side\r\nof the Budget will inevitably decline. When the full loan is raised\r\nthe annual charge will be L1,408,000, a stationary figure till the\r\nloan is redeemed. The Council is a genuine _Caisse de la Dette_; its\r\nrevenues are charged in the first instance with the loan charges, and\r\nthe liability of the separate colonies to make up any deficiency\r\ndistributes the weight of the debt equitably among the parties to it.\r\nThe danger of a _Caisse_, that it tends to check general prosperity by\r\na too arbitrary appropriation of revenue, is avoided by the very\r\nstrict conditions of the Council's power and the nature of its\r\nconstitution. The minor common services will not increase, and they\r\nmay very probably decrease, as such branches as surveys and permits\r\nshrink to normal limits. The large item of 1-1/2 million for the\r\nConstabulary will be lowered in future to about L1,200,000, which, on\r\nthe present establishment, must be regarded as a final figure. We may,\r\ntherefore, take L2,500,000 as the average expenditure in two years'\r\ntime, which, if railway receipts increase to a like figure in the same\r\ntime, would make the Inter-Colonial Budget balance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Transvaal is able to pay any contribution which\r\nmay be required from her. But in two years all or the greater part of\r\nthe War Loan will have been raised, and she may have to face a maximum\r\nannual charge of L1,200,000, which contains no provision for any\r\nsinking fund. In these circumstances, on her present revenue she could\r\npay nothing towards any inter-colonial deficit: she might even have to\r\nask for a contribution. There is every probability that such help\r\ncould be given, and an automatic system of adjustment might be framed\r\nby which any inter-colonial surplus could go to pay the charges or\r\nassist in the creation of a sinking fund for the War Loan. This is of\r\ncourse on the most unfavourable assumption,--that the War Loan has to\r\nbe raised at 4 per cent, that the present industrial depression\r\ncontinues, and that the Transvaal gets no increase of revenue from\r\nthat prosperity which she has a right to expect. It is far more\r\nprobable that the Council will be free to devote any surplus it may\r\nshow to the development of the common services, for which the Loan\r\nprovision cannot in the long-run be found adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [21]  This figure does not cover the expense of repatriation.\r\n        There was a free gift for the purpose of L5,000,000 by\r\n        the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\n  [22]  The Council is composed of the High Commissioner and\r\n        Governor (President), the two Lieutenant-Governors, the\r\n        Commissioner of Railways, the Inspector-General of the\r\n        South African Constabulary, two official members for\r\n        each colony, nominated by the Lieutenant-Governors, two\r\n        unofficial members for each colony, elected by the\r\n        unofficial members of the two legislatures, and two\r\n        members nominated by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n  [23]  These figures require a word of explanation. Only 30\r\n        millions of the loan have been issued, so the charge for\r\n        interest and management should only be L1,208,000; but\r\n        as the loan year began in May and the financial year for\r\n        the budget began in July, interest and management\r\n        charges for fourteen months were included.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to deny that the present is a period of financial strain.\r\nThe new colonies are solvent, but the margin is narrow. Like\r\neverything else in South Africa, their finances are on a needle-point,\r\nand require strenuous intelligence and constant economy. I have taken\r\nthe railway profits and customs receipts as incapable of falling below\r\ntheir present level; but it is to be remembered that the past year is\r\nnot a fair basis for prophecy, since the country has been in process of\r\nreconstruction, and the heavy importations for the purpose have swollen\r\nreceipts in both departments. If industrial progress is still\r\nretarded, both figures will sink enormously, and the whole system of\r\nfinance sketched in the preceding pages will require revision. If, on\r\nthe other hand, progress is assured, both figures will increase\r\nlargely, since, while this basis is high as compared with the present\r\nsituation, it is low compared with any real prosperity. In this case\r\nthe strain will be of short duration. _Ce n'est que le premier pas qui\r\ncoute._ Industrial development lies at the root of all things. The\r\nTransvaal can only hope for a large permanent increase of revenue from\r\nthe licences and profit tax paid by the mining industry and from\r\nCustoms receipts drawn from a wider basis of population. Unless this\r\nincrease comes she may be unable to meet her own war debt, or to\r\ncontribute anything to an inter-colonial deficit. Inter-colonial\r\nrevenues, too, can only expand from the same cause, for mining\r\nprosperity is at the bottom of railway profits. The State finances\r\ndepend upon mining development, and mining development depends on\r\nlabour: this is the true statement of the problem, and all others are\r\ninvolved in a vicious circle. And this is as it should be. On the\r\ngreat industry of the country the chief burden must lie.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, the possibility of windfalls. From the Crown\r\nshare of gold and diamond properties very large sums of money may\r\nfrom time to time flow to the Exchequer. But it is the part of a\r\nprudent finance minister to base his forecasts on the normal only,\r\nand to accept windfalls as gifts of Providence, to be used for\r\nspecial purposes. It may be necessary to draw upon this source of\r\nincome to meet the debt charges; but, should this misfortune be spared\r\nus, then we have in such windfalls the nucleus of a reserve fund for\r\ndevelopment. There is need, as we have seen, of a capital outlay on\r\ndevelopment far beyond that provided for in the Guaranteed Loan.\r\nRailway extension alone, before we have done with it, will need not 5\r\nmillions, but 10, and, in cases where new lines are built by private\r\ncompanies, we shall have to face sooner or later a considerable\r\nexpenditure on expropriation. Public works, when all the loan moneys\r\nhave been spent, will still be badly provided for. It may be necessary,\r\ntoo, to spend money in expropriating land for public parks, for game\r\npreserves, for public buildings, for new townships,--expenditure which\r\nin the first instance will fall upon the Government. So, too, with\r\nother schemes,--irrigation, the search for artesian water, the\r\nestablishment of colleges and technical schools, and all the thousand\r\nactivities of government in a new country, which will grow quickly and\r\ndevelop early a multitude of needs. Lastly, land settlement in the two\r\ncolonies, if it is to serve the social and political purpose which is\r\nits chief justification, demands more than the 3 millions allotted to\r\nit. Such expenditure is in the fullest sense an investment, since the\r\nbulk of it will be returned in time to the Exchequer with a reasonable\r\ninterest. It is proposed that, in so far as repayments of capital from\r\nsettlers are concerned, such repayments should form a special fund,\r\nwhich can go out again in fresh advances and further purchases of\r\nland. In this way a permanent fund for settlement will be created, and\r\nthe project will not be dependent upon a share of any annual surplus.\r\n\r\nThe economic problem of the new colonies finds a parallel in Egyptian\r\nreconstruction in more ways than the analogy of the _Caisse de la\r\nDette_. There is the same undeveloped wealth in the country, the same\r\nheavy bondage of debt, the same demand for reproductive expenditure.\r\nTo cut down the cost of living and the restraints on production, and\r\nat the same time to provide money for development and for the charges\r\nof an unproductive debt, is the threefold South African problem, as it\r\nwas the Egyptian. Solvency here, as there, is to be found in an\r\nequipoise, and requires a nice and discriminating statesmanship rather\r\nthan any heroic cutting of knots. In most respects the Egyptian\r\ndifficulty was far the greater, for there the cast-iron debt\r\nregulations and the endless European surveillance frustrated at every\r\nturn the efforts of her statesmen. But one danger was absent. In Egypt\r\npatience and diplomacy, faith in the country and in the work of time,\r\nwere so obviously the only cards to play, that, while there were many\r\ntemptations to lose heart and abandon the struggle, there was no\r\ninducement to try short cuts and forsake the true path of policy for\r\nthose showy and unconsidered measures which in the rare event of their\r\nsuccess are called heroic. In South Africa the amateur financier is so\r\nabroad in the land that we may look to find many odd nostrums\r\nadvocated to ensure prosperity. The kind of discussion which arose\r\nover the labour difficulty is a guide to what we may expect in the\r\nrealm of high finance. But in both the one and the other the real\r\nproblem is plain once the obscuration caused by conflicting interests\r\nis cleared away by a little common-sense.\r\n\r\nThe great questions of economics in relation to state growth are\r\nalways simple. If high finance means anything it is the power of\r\nadding two and two together. Complicated financial adjustments belong\r\nto a lower plane: the great financier may have no aptitude in reducing\r\nresults to a decimal. But there is this distinction, that whereas in\r\nthe intricate calculations of secondary finance the figures are mere\r\ncounters, the elaboration of accepted data, in the higher and simpler\r\nfinance they are symbols. To the statesman they are the gauge of\r\nprosperity or decline, and behind them stand the millions of workers,\r\nthe miles of crops, the floods and droughts and pestilences, the rise\r\nand fall of industries, the ore in the mine, the web in the factory,\r\nthe cattle in the stockyard. The yield of a land tax is to him not a\r\nfigure but a symbol, and in using it he has regard not only to its\r\nformal place in estimates and returns, but to its political meaning.\r\nIt is, if you like, the quality which in other spheres constitutes\r\nthe distinction between statesmen and high permanent officials,\r\nbetween economists and statisticians, between all leaders and all\r\nsubordinates. In the finance of a country which is still in process\r\nof reconstruction, this power, so uncommon and so inestimable, of\r\ngetting behind figures to facts, and keeping the hand on the pulse of\r\nnational progress, is the only guarantee of ultimate success. In this\r\nlight the prospects of the new colonies give good reason for hope.\r\nThe budget of to-day, formally regarded, shows a delicate equipoise,\r\nin which a pessimist might find material for dark forebodings; but it\r\nis only the symbol of that stress of re-creation which must precede\r\nan ample prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SETTLEMENT OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTo the Boer the land was the beginning and end of all things: a town\r\nwas only a necessary excrescence, an industry an uitlander whim. A land\r\npolicy is therefore one of the first burdens which attend our heritage.\r\nHappily we are not seriously impeded by the wreckage of systems which\r\nhave failed. The Boer Government had no land legislation, and the few\r\nlaws, such as the Occupation Law of 1886, which touched on the\r\nquestion, were less statutory enactments than administrative\r\nresolutions. The Boer farmer, or his father, secured his land when the\r\ncountry was unoccupied, and he had merely to arrange the boundary\r\nquestion with friendly neighbours. He held it on freehold title, with\r\nno reservation of quit-rent to the Government. When the existing\r\npopulation had thus been settled, the balance of unoccupied country\r\nfell to the State; and this was further parcelled out by grants to\r\npoor burghers, doles for war service, establishment of native\r\nreserves, and in the wilder districts by the system of occupation\r\ntenure. But in spite of all grants a considerable portion remained\r\nState territory--over 44,000 square miles in the Transvaal, of which\r\nat least 19,000,000 acres are unsurveyed. In the Orange River Colony\r\nthe State lands are smaller, not exceeding, with all recent purchases,\r\n1,400,000 acres. The land question in the two colonies is therefore of\r\nthe simplest: the best farms, including most of the rich pockets of\r\nalluvial land, are the freehold possession of a small number of Dutch\r\nfarmers; the balance is the more or less encumbered perquisite of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe condition of agriculture in the two colonies was primitive in the\r\nextreme, a truth quite independent of the question whether such\r\nelementary methods were not the only possible. The first comers were\r\npastoralists and nothing more, coming as they did from the great\r\npastoral regions in the north of Cape Colony. The average farm was\r\nlaid out for stock, and was rarely less than 6000 acres. On the old\r\nestimate eight acres was required for each head of horned cattle and\r\ntwo for each sheep. The Boer was not an advanced stock-farmer in any\r\nsense of the word. He found certain diseases indigenous to the country\r\nwhich he did not seriously attempt to cope with. He rarely fenced his\r\nstock-routes and outspans or endeavoured to improve the carrying\r\ncapacity of the land by paddocking. The high veld in winter is burned\r\nbrown by sun and wind and nipped by frosts, so that it gives little\r\nsustenance to stock; but the rich vegetation in summer should have\r\nprovided, by means of ensilage, ample feeding for the winter months.\r\nThis simple device was never used, and when the grass failed the Boer\r\ntrekked with his herds to his low-veld farm, whence he frequently\r\nbrought back the seeds of disease in his animals. In the quality of\r\nhis stock he was equally backward. In the Afrikander ox he had the\r\nmakings of one of the hardiest and strongest draught animals in the\r\nworld. In the Afrikander pony he had the basis of a wonderful breed of\r\nriding-horses, to whose merits the late war has sufficiently\r\ntestified. He never seriously tried to improve one or the other.\r\nStallions of wretched quality were allowed to run wild among his\r\nmares, and he had no system of culling to raise the quality of his\r\nherds. The market for his beef and mutton was small and uncritical, so\r\nthat the amassing of animals became with him rather the sign visible\r\nof prosperity than a serious professional enterprise.\r\n\r\nAt first the Boer did little more than till a garden. On each farm\r\nthere was a certain water-supply, and around the spruit or fountain a\r\npocket of alluvial land. The ordinary soil, both in the Transvaal and\r\nthe Orange River Colony, is, with some remarkable exceptions, poor and\r\neasily worked out; but those alluvial patches are so rich as to be\r\npractically inexhaustible. The Boer and the Kaffir shared one gift in\r\ncommon, an infallible eye for good country, though there was this\r\ndifference between them that the Boer chose the heavy river-side lands,\r\nwhile the Kaffir, who was a shallow cultivator, preferred as a rule the\r\nlighter slopes where he could pick with ease. In 1885 the Boer farmer\r\ndid little more than irrigate his garden; but the increase in the\r\npopulation of the towns, and the growth of a market for cereals,\r\nfruits, and vegetables, made him extend his irrigation farther, so that\r\nin a few years the whole of his alluvial pocket was under water.\r\nFormerly he had been a pure pastoralist; now he became also an\r\nagriculturist, and after his fashion a narrow-minded one, for\r\nirrigation, which was his first successful experiment, was at once\r\nexalted by him into an axiomatic law. The Kaffir, who in his way is a\r\nskilful farmer and an experimentalist on a far wider scale, believed\r\nin dry lands; but the Boer confined himself to his irrigation and his\r\nsummer and winter crops. Two views have been promulgated on the Boer\r\nmethod. One is, that it is the true and only type possible in the\r\ncountry, discovered after long years of intelligent experience. The\r\nBoer, it is said, is unprogressive, because he knows the limitations\r\nunder which he works, and all new-comers who have begun by trying new\r\nmethods have sooner or later fallen into line with the old inhabitants.\r\nThe supporters of this view point to the scarcity of English farmers in\r\nthe land who have made a success of their farms on any other than the\r\nBoer methods. There seems to be no real justification for this opinion.\r\nThe Boer has no settled principles of farming; he is an experimentalist\r\nin practice, whatever he may be in theory. We have seen that he began\r\nas a pastoralist, advanced to be also a gardener, and is now a\r\ncultivator of lands under irrigation. In some twenty years, had he\r\nbeen allowed to develop unchecked, he would doubtless have come round\r\nto the Kaffir view of the dry lands. Fifteen years ago the country\r\nstore-keeper stocked only the old single-furrow wooden plough: to-day\r\non Boer farms you may see double-furrow steel ploughs, disc ploughs,\r\ndisc cultivators, not to speak of such elaborate farm machinery as\r\naermotors, reapers and binders, steam chaff-cutters, and in some few\r\ncases steam-ploughs. The more progressive Boers have changed utterly\r\ntheir methods of orchard-management, and at the present moment they\r\nare reconsidering their methods of tobacco-growing. The point is\r\nimportant, because if the Boer has really found out long ago the\r\nlimitations of the soil and the only principles of farming, then so\r\nfar from deserving the name of unprogressive he has shown himself\r\neminently wise. But the theory of Boer stability is a chimera. He\r\nchanges every year in his attitude towards the soil,--changes\r\nunwillingly, it may be, but certainly; and though a few dogmas take a\r\nlong time to alter, they alter in the end. It is equally incorrect to\r\nargue from the absence of successful immigrant farmers on progressive\r\nlines. They were few in number, because in a country where the rural\r\npopulation was mainly hostile, the new-comers who began by farming\r\nended as a rule by drifting to the towns. But, to cite one case,\r\nmealies have been grown on dry lands on the American plan with great\r\nprofit to the farmer; and the German tobacco-planters in the north\r\nhave shown how profitable fruit and tobacco growing can become, if\r\nconducted on principles rather than on tradition.\r\n\r\nBut it is as great a mistake to regard the Boer farmer as utterly\r\nwithout capacity. He had no need to bestir himself. He lived simply\r\nand supplied his own modest needs. He saw his farm going up in price\r\nthrough the general appreciation of land values, and he sold a bit now\r\nand again and increased his herds; or he might receive a large sum for\r\nthe option on the minerals under the soil. He was cheated by the\r\ncountry store-keeper, and he rarely attempted to reach distant\r\nmarkets. The old vicious system of allowing natives to farm on his\r\nland in return for a certain amount of compulsory labour--a system\r\nunchanged by that abortive piece of law-making, the Plakkerswet--made\r\nhim unthrifty and improvident. He had no labour bill to cast up, no\r\nfinancial position which wanted investigation at each year's end.\r\nHence the difficulty of framing any accurate forecast of the prospects\r\nof farming in the new colonies: there are no statistics to follow, no\r\nscale of values for land or produce. But the Boer had an empirical\r\nscience of his own. He knew exactly the capacity of his irrigated\r\nland, though he never thought of formulating his knowledge. He had\r\nmany rough and effective precautions against blight and disease, and\r\nhe had a kind of gipsy veterinary skill. He was not industrious, but I\r\nthink he must be allowed the credit of having done his best for the\r\nland on his own principles. He was a great buyer of new farm\r\nmachinery, partly perhaps out of curiosity, and on this point at least\r\nhis conservatism was not consistent. Some of his methods were based on\r\ncommon rural superstitions--for example, he always sowed, if possible,\r\nat the full moon. His habit, too, of seeking a theological explanation\r\nof all misfortunes was destructive of energy. When the locusts or the\r\n_galziekte_ came he lit his pipe and said it was the will of God, a\r\nvisitation which it would be impious to resist. Hardly, perhaps, the\r\nproper attitude for success in this modern world, but under his\r\npeculiar conditions he never felt its folly. It is impossible to\r\nbelieve that the Boer has done justice to the country, but we may\r\nreadily grant him skill and good sense in the narrow world in which he\r\ndwelt.\r\n\r\nThe land problem in the new colonies is partly political and partly\r\neconomic, and on the solution of the latter branch of the question\r\nthe former largely depends. There are urgent reasons why an English\r\npopulation should grow up on the land; but unless this population\r\ncan make a profitable living it would be folly to encourage its\r\nimmigration. On this economic question it is impossible to dogmatise.\r\nData, as I have said, are lacking and have never existed. At the best\r\nwe can frame some sort of tentative answer--a hope rather than a\r\npromise; and we are justified in this course because those who attack\r\nthe policy have no better argument to offer.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the ordinary farmer sold his stock and his produce at\r\nfair prices in his country town. The bulk of it, together with the\r\nproduce which the more enterprising farmers sent direct, went to\r\nJohannesburg, where on the whole high prices were maintained. So good\r\nwere the prices that the farmers of the eastern and western provinces\r\nof Cape Colony found it profitable, notwithstanding customs and heavy\r\nrailway freights, to make Johannesburg their chief market. But in\r\nspite of all local production, Johannesburg was not fully supplied.\r\nFood-stuffs in large quantities had to be imported from abroad. In\r\n1898 agricultural produce, raw and manufactured, to the value of\r\nnearly L2,500,000 was imported into the Transvaal. Arguing on these\r\nfacts, many have predicted a rosy future for all branches of South\r\nAfrican farming. What has been imported, they say, can be grown; the\r\nmining industry will advance, and agriculture will follow with equal\r\nsteps. But such rudimentary hopes can scarcely be held to exhaust a\r\nvery complicated and delicate problem, to which some answer must be\r\nsuggested before any needs of policy can be thought of. There are two\r\nquestions to be met: How far is the land capable of intensive and\r\nsustained production? and, granting the capacity, what guarantee is\r\nthere of profitable markets?\r\n\r\nThe soil of the new colonies, as I have said, is sharply divided into\r\nalluvial pockets and dry lands,--the former highly cultivated, the\r\nlatter, except for Kaffir locations, mainly neglected. But since for\r\none alluvial acre there are a hundred dry morgen, the progress of the\r\ncountry may be said to depend upon the dry lands. It follows that\r\npasturage must remain the staple form of farming. The bulk of the dry\r\nlands are light and thin in soil, and the natural humours of the ground\r\nhave been much exhausted by the unthrifty habit of veld-burning. But in\r\nspite of all drawbacks it is a country of abundant summer grass, both\r\nsweet veld and sour veld, which is capable of great improvement by any\r\nproper system of paddocking and depasturing. Large quantities of veld\r\ngrass might be cut for winter fodder, and roots and forage crops could\r\nbe grown in summer for the same purpose. Farms, which at present carry\r\nan ox to every eight acres and a sheep to every two, might be made\r\ncapable of supporting a vastly greater stock. But there are certain\r\ndrawbacks to stock-farming peculiar to the country, the chief being the\r\nnumber of diseases indigenous and imported. At the present moment to\r\nbring in valuable stock to most districts of the new colonies is a\r\ndangerous experiment. Horses die of horse-sickness, sheep of scab and\r\nanthrax, cattle of rinderpest, red-water, and the immense variety of\r\n_ziektes_ from _galziekte_ to _gielziekte_. Before the new colonies can\r\nadvance to the rank of great pastoral lands which is their right,\r\nvigorous methods must be taken to stamp out diseases wherever they\r\nappear, and to take precautions against their recurrence. The country\r\nmust be fenced, stock-routes and outspans must be established and\r\nguarded, and a stringent Brands Act must be passed to give security to\r\nthe stock-owner in a country where stock is notoriously prone to\r\nvanish.[24]\r\n\r\nGiven good laws, adequately administered, the Transvaal and the Orange\r\nRiver Colony may well become countries of large and prosperous\r\nstock-farms. Here, it has been argued, the matter ends. Agriculture\r\nmust confine itself in most cases to the growth of domestic supplies\r\nand winter forage. I cannot, after a careful examination of most parts\r\nof the country, bring myself to accept this view. Much may be done by\r\nirrigation to increase the area of land under water. Sir W. Willcocks'\r\nReport[25] proposes to give to South Africa 3,000,000 acres of\r\nperennially irrigated land at a cost of about L30,000,000; but as he\r\nargues for the undertaking on the basis of certain doubtful land\r\nvaluations, this large estimate may have to be considerably modified.\r\nUnirrigated land, he says, varies from 2s. 6d. to L3 per acre:\r\nirrigation costs from L7, 10s. to L15 per acre; and the price of good\r\nirrigated land runs from L20 to L100. On this reasoning there is room\r\nfor a handsome profit, but the argument is based rather on fictitious\r\nmarket values than on the intrinsic normal producing power of the\r\nsoil. At the time when Sir W. Willcocks' Report was written--the last\r\nyear of the war--land values were inflated, and the prices of produce\r\ngrown under water were extremely high. In the average year for which\r\nwe must provide little irrigated land will be worth to the farmer more\r\nthan from L5 to L10 per acre, and certain irrigation schemes which, on\r\nSir W. Willcocks' showing would return a profit, would in reality\r\nspell ruin to their promoters. Irrigation is necessary on a certain\r\nscale for a reason which we shall discuss later; and in many cases it\r\ncould be effected at a moderate cost. But expensive irrigation works\r\nfor agriculture alone are, I believe, of doubtful wisdom in almost\r\nevery part of the country. What is of infinitely greater importance\r\nis the procuring of water in the dry tracts by tanks, wells, and, if\r\npossible, by artesian bores. Vast stock districts in Waterberg and\r\nLichtenburg would have their value quadrupled if a permanent supply of\r\nwater, even for stock purposes only, could be procured. The Australian\r\nmethod of tank-sinking has already been followed with success in the\r\nSpringbok Flats, and it is at least possible that artesian water may\r\nbe found. Everywhere the soil contains water at a low depth, which\r\npercolates through the porous rock, and is brought to a stand by\r\ndykes of harder stone. Hence has arisen the old African fiction of\r\nunderground rivers, which is true to the extent that no man has far\r\nto dig before he finds water. It is rather with such tank- and\r\nwell-sinking that a water expert should deal, and with the regulation\r\nof the present ridiculous apportionment of water rights. No serious\r\nwork can be done in this department till the State assumes the right\r\nof distributing water, and has it in its power to prevent the\r\nriparian owner from following an obstructive course to the detriment\r\nof his neighbours. Irrigation in a few cases should be followed, and\r\na greater portion of land brought under water in the interests of\r\nmixed farming; but it is in another direction that we must look for\r\nthe sheet-anchor of South African agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall of the new colonies is generally well distributed.\r\nCopious rains fall from September to April, and then come the four dry\r\nand windy months of winter. On irrigated lands summer and winter crops\r\nare grown; on dry lands a summer crop only. But the Boer believed that\r\nthe crops which he could grow on dry lands were very limited, and he\r\nhabitually grew mealies, potatoes, lucerne, and tobacco under water.\r\nIt is, of course, a great advantage to reap two crops a-year; but if a\r\nman can get two crops from 5 acres only and one crop from 500, this\r\none crop, on ordinary principles of common-sense, should command his\r\nchief attention. Deducting the greater expense for labour, the one\r\ncrop is still thirty or forty times as important as the other two.\r\nThis is roughly the agricultural problem of the dry lands. They have\r\nnever been really exploited. The Kaffir has picked at the edges; a few\r\nprogressive farmers have made good profits by growing mealies and\r\ntobacco dry on the American plan. But it was much easier to potter\r\nabout with a water-furrow than to attempt to plough the dry and\r\nunbroken flats. Dry-land farming is therefore pioneer farming, and\r\npioneering with a good hope of success. Granted the markets, there is\r\nno reason why great tracts should not be ploughed from end to end, and\r\na huge crop of cereals and roots raised yearly. Steam-ploughing and\r\nevery labour-saving device will be necessary, for this is farming on\r\nthe grand scale. The outlook is made brighter when we realise that\r\nthose despised dry lands are some of the richest in the country. The\r\nfamous Standerton black soil, the environs of Middelburg, part of the\r\nBloemhof and Klerksdorp districts, and, above all, the Springbok\r\nFlats,[26] where there may be half a million acres of the richest\r\nblack soil 12 feet deep, and another half million acres of excellent\r\nred soil--such are a few instances of lands which await an early\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThere is still another aspect of this problem which concerns a small\r\ngroup of semi-tropical products--fruits, tobacco, rubber, coffee,\r\nand, possibly, cocoa. There are tracts which have proved themselves to\r\nbe as highly fitted for such crops as any in the world. They are\r\ncrops, too, for which the acreage required is small, and whose value\r\nis so high in proportion to bulk that the freightage does not\r\nseriously detract from profits. Given, again, the market, and there is\r\nno reason why the present yield should not be centupled.\r\n\r\nThe market--that is the rock on which arguments divide. The rosy hopes\r\nof the market to be furnished by the Transvaal which some minds\r\nentertained during the war have given place with many to an equally\r\nfantastic pessimism. I do not propose to provide a tabulated statement\r\nof costs and prices. I have seen such statements arrive by the\r\nclearest reasoning at opposite conclusions. But it is worth while to\r\nconsider soberly what are the market prospects in the future for the\r\nfarmer of the new colonies. A comparison of imports gives little\r\nassistance. In the year 1902 the raw agricultural produce imported\r\ninto the Transvaal, all of which might be locally produced, was worth\r\nover 2 millions sterling; and the imports of manufactured and\r\npartially manufactured produce, the bulk of which might be produced\r\nand manufactured locally, came close on another million. These figures\r\nmay be taken as below normal, since supplies for the army of\r\noccupation are not included, and at the same time the number of\r\ninhabitants in the towns and natives in the mines were largely below\r\nthe ordinary figures. On the other hand, little agriculture existed,\r\nand practically all supplies for the existing population, such as it\r\nwas, had to be brought from the adjoining colonies or from over-seas.\r\nOn this basis, therefore, there is a considerable and highly\r\nprofitable market for the limited agriculture and pastoral enterprise\r\nof the country. But in framing any forecast two new factors must be\r\ntaken into consideration. If the towns are to develop, the cost of\r\nliving must be greatly reduced; which means in the first instance that\r\nall ordinary food-stuffs must be imported free of duty and at cheap\r\nrailway rates. Again, when all the Boer farmers have been resettled on\r\ntheir lands and a multitude of new-comers occupy Crown farms, the\r\nlocal agricultural output will be very largely increased. The farmer,\r\nwho at the moment can sell his garden stuff, his crops of potatoes,\r\nmealies, and forage, and his stock at a good profit, will find himself\r\nfaced by over-sea produce, grown wholesale under the most favourable\r\nconditions, and sold at a price with which he cannot compete and live.\r\nThis is, I think, a true forecast--for the small improvident farmer.\r\nThe man who grows mealies on a large scale with labour-saving\r\nappliances, or who has a well-managed stock-ranch, will make a profit\r\non wholesale dealings. In agriculture and pasturage, as in other\r\nactivities, Providence is on the side of the bigger battalions, and\r\nthe small man who grows on an expensive scale will be pushed out by\r\nthe large man who grows economically. Prophecy is an intricate task,\r\nespecially on land questions, but it seems clear that the only class\r\nwho will not have to dread to some extent a change in present\r\nconditions, a cheapening of the means of life, and the influx of a\r\nlarge agricultural population, will be the wholesale farmers and\r\npastoralists, who follow the methods of over-sea producers and enjoy\r\nthe advantage of living at their customers' doors.\r\n\r\nBut this does not exhaust the question. Is, then, the small holder of\r\n100 or 200 acres, or the owner of a mixed farm of 1000 acres, to\r\nbecome extinct in the land? It depends entirely on themselves. In\r\ndistricts such as Waterberg, Zoutpansberg, and Barberton, the holder\r\nof 50 acres under water will be able to put vegetables and fruit on\r\nthe Rand market a fortnight before any other grower in the world. His\r\nprice is assured beyond doubt; and if he may find little profit for\r\nsix months in the year, he is in no worse case than many prosperous\r\nmarket-gardeners in Kent and Surrey. It is here that the value of\r\nirrigation appears. Such a small holder, again, may be able to make a\r\nprofit from dairying all the year round, provided local creameries are\r\nestablished, and he goes the proper way about it. So, too, with mixed\r\nfarming, of which the essence is that one product can be set off\r\nagainst another. If a farmer finds cereals unproductive, he can put\r\npart of his land into pasture; it is unlikely that the price of meat\r\nwill fall below a paying point, granted the expected industrial\r\ndevelopment. In addition there are certain crops, such as tobacco,\r\nwhere the profits, even allowing for a large decline in present\r\nprices, are great, the freightage small, and the market worldwide. The\r\naim of mixed farming is to provide an elaborate system of alternate\r\nschemes, which between them will preserve a fairly permanent average\r\nof profit.\r\n\r\nThe basis of all farming prosperity is the growth of the mining\r\nindustry and the creation of new industries. Any attempt to protect\r\nfarming by tolls or imposts is foredoomed to a miserable failure.\r\nSink, if necessary, farming considerations altogether for the moment;\r\nlook only to mining development, if need be; abolish the old market\r\nprices and ruin the old local producer: it is all good policy, and in\r\nthe long-run the true agricultural interest. When the present\r\nfictitious basis is got rid of, the true and lasting agricultural\r\nprosperity may begin. There seems no reason to doubt that in the\r\nfuture there will be a sound local market for the large producer, for\r\nthe favourably situated small holder, and for the judicious farmer of\r\nmixed land. Nor is there any reason why in time a considerable export\r\ntrade should not be established. As the great produce-exporting\r\ncountries of the world grow more populous, South Africa may yet play\r\nits part in feeding Europe. With improved internal communications,\r\nand thousands of miles of fine pasture land, there is no reason why,\r\na fortnight nearer Europe than Australia, she should not take her share\r\nof the frozen-meat traffic of the world. In tobacco, again, to take\r\nonly one instance, a very considerable export trade may arise. The soil\r\nis well suited; the rough leaf, grown on the most unscientific method,\r\nis as good as anything produced by Virginia and Borneo. The large\r\ntobacco-growers, or the small holders attached to a tobacco-factory,\r\nmay very well find a profitable outlet for their wares abroad, and the\r\nEnglish manufacturers discover a new producing ground in a British\r\ncolony with which to resist the attacks of transatlantic combines.\r\n\r\nThe farming prospects in the new colonies, even if stripped of all\r\nfanciful stuff, are sound and hopeful. There may come bad times for\r\nall. The ordinary market-gardener will for a certainty find himself\r\npoorly off five years hence; and all classes may have their periods of\r\nstress and despair. Such visitations are part of the primeval curse\r\nupon tillers of the soil. The New Zealand and Australian pastoralists\r\nhad sunk very low before the discovery of cold storage saved the\r\nsituation. The Ceylon planters, after the coffee blight, seemed on the\r\nbrink of ruin, when the introduction of tea-growing more than restored\r\ntheir former prosperity. An immunity from farming risks can no more\r\nbe guaranteed in the new colonies than in other countries. The real\r\nquestion is, Can they offer the settler no greater risks than he has\r\nto face elsewhere, and at least a fair chance of greater prosperity?\r\nOn a reasonable survey of the case, I think it will be found that they\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nWith this clearing of the ground we can turn with an open mind to the\r\npolitical question. The secular antithesis of town and country is as\r\nmarked here as elsewhere, and the political problem varies accordingly.\r\nIn the country we have to create in a large measure from the\r\nfoundation; we have to meet and nullify the prevailing apathy, and\r\nundertake as a Government many tasks which would elsewhere be left to\r\nprivate enterprise. There the wounds of war gape more widely, and have\r\nto be healed by more cunning simples. People have spoken as if the\r\ntowns were the sole factor in the case. Make the towns prosperous and\r\nwholly British, it has been said, and the land is ours. The towns are\r\nthe loyal units; as they advance in prosperity the rural districts will\r\nsink out of account; and rightly, for their wealth is small, their\r\npopulation hostile, and their future barren. \"Twenty years hence,\"\r\nwrote in 1896 an observer as clear-sighted as he was hopeful, \"the\r\nwhite population is likely to be composed in about equal proportions\r\nof urban and rural elements. The urban element will be mainly mining,\r\ngathered at one great centre on the Witwatersrand, and possibly at\r\nsome smaller centres in other districts. The rural element, consisting\r\nof people who live in villages or solitary farmhouses, will remain\r\ncomparatively backward, because little affected by the social forces\r\nwhich work swiftly and potently upon close-packed industrial\r\ncommunities, and it may find itself very different in tone, temper,\r\nand tendencies from its urban fellow-citizens.\"[27] So we find one\r\nclass of mine-owners arguing that any attempt to settle the country\r\ndistricts is a work of supererogation, and urging the Government to\r\nconcentrate all its efforts on the promotion of their own industry,\r\ndeclaring that from their prosperity every blessing will flow forth to\r\nthe rural parts. It is impossible to contemplate with equanimity the\r\nresult of merely letting things alone. No industrial development would\r\never compensate for it, for the unleavened Dutch rural districts would\r\nbecome centres to collect and focus and stereotype the old unfaltering\r\ndislike. A hard-and-fast division between town and country is always\r\nto be feared; but when the barrier is between white men, and is built\r\nup of race, wealth, and civilisation, it can only be a dire calamity.\r\nWe cannot rear up for our children a race of helots, and by our very\r\nexclusiveness solidify for all time an irreconcilable race division.\r\nIf we preserve such an enemy within our bounds, and just beyond our\r\ngates, the time may come when a few isolated townships will represent\r\nBritain in South Africa. To prevent this cleavage, urban and rural\r\ndevelopment should advance with equal steps. The two races will be\r\njoined not by any trivial sentimental devices, but by the partnership\r\nof Dutch and British farmers in the enlightened development of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThere is another and a profounder reason for this introduction of\r\nBritish blood. The day may come when the South African, splendid as\r\nhas been his loyalty and many his sacrifices, may go the way of most\r\ncolonists, and lose something of that close touch with the\r\nmother-country which is necessary in the interests of a federated\r\nempire. It is always the temptation of town-dwellers, with their busy\r\nlife and their own engrossing interests, and the tremendous mixture of\r\nalien blood in the country may serve to hasten this result beyond the\r\nordinary rate of colonial progress. But the country settler is a\r\ndifferent person. He retains a longer and simpler affection for the\r\ncountry of his birth. An influx of such a class would consolidate\r\nSouth African sentiment, and, when self-government comes, protect\r\nimperial interests better than any constitutional guarantee. This is\r\nthe class which has the true stake in the country, deriving its life\r\nfrom the nurture of the earth, striving with winds and weather, and\r\nslowly absorbing into the fibre of its being those influences which\r\nmake for race and patriotism.\r\n\r\nSouth African agriculture, as the shrewdest observers have long\r\nforeseen, could never be improved until there arose a political reason\r\nfor its improvement. The reason for the experiment has arrived, and\r\nits basis is in existence. In the inheritance of Crown lands which\r\nremains from the mismanaged estate of the late Government, and in the\r\nlong lists of ex-irregulars and others who sought land, there was the\r\nraw material of settlement. It is no case for flamboyant prophecies.\r\nThe certain difficulties are as great as the probable advantages. But\r\nto shrink from those difficulties is to have towns where British ideas\r\nof government, can be realised and outside vast rural districts,\r\nsuspicious, unfriendly, potentially dangerous; to neglect a golden\r\nopportunity of increasing the British element in South Africa; and to\r\nturn the back upon farming, which must always be the most permanent\r\nasset of any nation. The determinant fact in the case is that the\r\nalternative is so black that all risks must be faced rather than\r\naccept it. With such considerations in mind, the Government put forth\r\na scheme of settlement, with the examination of which the remainder of\r\nthis chapter is concerned. It is not my business to write the history\r\nof the Crown Colony administration, and therefore no time need be\r\ngiven to the many difficulties which faced the scheme, the mistakes\r\nmade, and the hopeful results attained in certain cases. It is the\r\nproblem itself which demands attention, and the adequacy or inadequacy\r\nof the policy which has been framed to meet it. Land settlement is\r\nfrom its very nature a slow business, with tardy fruits: twenty years\r\nhence we may be in a position to judge by results. But in the meantime\r\nit is possible, when the data are known, to ascertain whether a policy\r\nis on _a priori_ grounds adapted to meet them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [24]  A Fencing Act, a Stock-Route Act, and a Brands Act on\r\n        the most progressive lines have been prepared for the\r\n        Transvaal. An excellent Fencing Act, badly\r\n        administered, has always existed in the Orange River\r\n        Colony, and a Brands Act, inferior to the Transvaal\r\n        measure, has been passed in that colony. But it is the\r\n        effective administration of the Acts which is of\r\n        importance.\r\n\r\n  [25]  Parliamentary Paper C.D. 1163.\r\n\r\n  [26]  My friend, Colonel Owen Thomas, had some samples of\r\n        Transvaal soil analysed, and the report was very\r\n        discouraging. To set against this, a sample of Springbok\r\n        Flats soil was pronounced by a distinguished English\r\n        expert, to whom it was sent, to be one of the richest\r\n        specimens of virgin soil he had seen.\r\n\r\n  [27]  Bryce, Impressions of South Africa, 3rd edition, p. 451.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Crown lands of the Transvaal, as I have said, amount to upwards of\r\n29 million acres, the Crown lands of the Orange River Colony to under\r\n1-1/2 million. So far as the latter colony is concerned, land\r\nsettlement is rather in the nature of estate management. The lands are\r\ntoo small for any serious political purpose, nor would the most\r\nextended settlement make much impression upon the solid Dutch rural\r\ncommunity. But in the Transvaal the Crown in several districts is by\r\nfar the largest landowner, and in others it holds the key of the\r\nposition. Take a Transvaal map coloured according to ownership, and\r\nred is easily the master colour. A solid block of it occupies the\r\nnorth-east corner; large islands of it appear in the western and\r\neastern borders; and the centre is plentifully dotted. Save in the\r\nlittle known north-east those lands are generally pasture, and in too\r\nmany cases dry and arid bush-veld. In the Standerton district, and in\r\nparts of Rustenburg, Potchefstroom, and Bloemhof, there are tracts of\r\ngood irrigated or irrigable lands; while in Barberton, Lydenburg,\r\nZoutpansberg, and Marico there are considerable districts well watered\r\nand well suited for tropical and sub-tropical products. Taken as a\r\nwhole, however, only a small portion of the Crown holding is suitable\r\nfor early settlement--say 2-1/2 million acres within the next three\r\nyears. But there is a wide hinterland for development, and in\r\nsettlement, as in empire, a hinterland is a moral necessity. There must\r\nbe an open country to which the sons of farmers, in whom the love of\r\nthe life is born, can trek as pioneers, otherwise there is a futile\r\ndivision into smaller holdings, or a more futile exodus to the towns.\r\nBesides, there should be room for the townsman--the miner, the artisan,\r\nthe trader--to feel that there is somewhere an open country where he\r\ncan invest his savings if he has a mind for a simpler life. As railways\r\nspread out into new districts, land will become agricultural which is\r\nnow pasture; and, as the pastoral industry develops and herds are\r\nformed and diseases are mastered, the ranchman will occupy large tracts\r\nof what is now the unused hunting-veld.\r\n\r\nThe Government scheme aims at making a beginning with this\r\nsettlement--a beginning only, for no government has ever been able to\r\nreconstruct alone, and the bulk of the work must be done by private\r\nenterprise. If 2000 farmers from England and the colonies can be\r\nsettled in the rural parts before the day of stress arrives, then the\r\nwork has been fairly started. A nucleus will have been formed to which\r\nthe years will add, an element which will both leaven the slow and\r\nsuspicious rustic society and provide a make-weight against the\r\nparochialism of the great towns. A country party is wanted which can\r\nlook beyond the dorp and the mine-head, and view South African\r\ninterests broadly and soberly. Such a party must be common to both\r\ntown and country, but it cannot be built up wholly from either. It\r\nmust, in the first instance, be a British party; but if this British\r\nparty is to become a South African party, it must stand for interests\r\ncommon to both races and to all classes. The formation of this\r\nleavening element cannot be left to time and chance, but must be aided\r\nby conscious effort. The land is largely unproved, and full of dangers\r\nto crops and stock. The new-comer must therefore be treated gently,\r\nand helped over the many stiles which confront him. He will usually be\r\na man of small means, and his limited capital must be put to the best\r\nuse, and eked out with judicious Government advances. He should have\r\nfew payments to make during his early years, when payments will\r\nnecessarily come out of capital. Above all, the acquirement of the\r\nfull freehold in his land on reasonable terms, and within a reasonable\r\ntime, should be kept constantly before him as an encouragement to\r\nthrift and industry, for the sense of freehold, as the voortrekkers\r\nused to say, \"turns sand into gold.\" Much of the Crown lands will never\r\nbe suitable for any but the largest stockholders. These it is easy to\r\ndeal with as a mere matter of estate-management; but the political\r\npurport of the scheme is concerned with intensive settlement, with the\r\nsmall holder and the mixed farmer of moderate means, who can provide a\r\nsolid colony of mutually supporting and progressive Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal \"Settlers' Ordinance\" of 1902 is based upon the mass of\r\nlegislation which embodies the settlement schemes of the Australasian\r\ncolonies. The usual method in such experiments has been to begin in\r\ndesperate fear of the settler, tying him up with cast-iron rules, and\r\nruining him in a very few years. Then the pendulum swings back, and\r\nsettlement is made easy and profitable, the old safeguards are\r\nabolished, and the land becomes full of rich squatters and companies,\r\nwho fatten on State munificence through the numerous dummy settlers in\r\ntheir pay. Finally, after long years a compromise is effected, and\r\nthat shy creature, the _bona-fide_ settler, is sought for far and\r\nnear. By this time it is probable that the thing has got a bad name,\r\nand men whose fathers and grandfathers lost money under former\r\nschemes, are chary of trusting themselves again to the tender mercies\r\nof a land-owning State. This, or something like it, has been the\r\nexperience of the Australasian colonies. Either land was given out\r\nindiscriminately and a valuable State asset cheaply parted with, or\r\nthe conditions of tenure were such as to ruin the small holder and put\r\neverything in the hands of a few rich syndicates. The land laws of\r\nAustralia and New Zealand form, therefore, a most valuable precedent.\r\nWe have their experiments before our eyes, and can learn from their\r\noften disastrous experience.\r\n\r\nSettlement in New South Wales, to take one instance, was begun partly\r\nas a Treasury expedient and partly as an election cry. Under the Act\r\nof 1867 a settler was allowed to peg off, as on a mining area, a\r\nclaim not exceeding 320 acres, without any attempt at a previous\r\nvaluation and survey. The result was a wild rush, where nobody\r\nbenefited except the blackmailer, who seized the strategic points of\r\nthe country, such as water-holes, and had to be bought out at a fancy\r\nprice. It does not surprise one to learn that of settlers under this\r\nscheme not one in twenty remains to-day. By subsequent Acts the\r\nmaximum acreage was increased; but in any case it was an arbitrary\r\nfigure, and it was not till 1895 that it was left within the widest\r\nlimits to the discretion of the Minister of Lands. Areas proved too\r\nsmall, since no provision could be made for the increase of stock and\r\nthe necessary fall in prices which attended settlement. In valuation\r\nthe extraordinary plan was adopted of giving a uniform capital value\r\nof L1 per acre to all land. The country being unproved, values were\r\nabsolutely unknown, nor was any provision made for revaluation. The\r\nresult was that the settler struggled along till he was ruined and\r\nhis holding forfeited, when the holding lapsed to the State, which,\r\nbeing unable to find a new tenant, was compelled to let it remain\r\nvacant, having accomplished nothing but the needless ruin of the\r\nfirst man. The \"Settlers' Ordinance\" has endeavoured to avoid laying\r\ndown any rules which experience has not tried and tested. The\r\ndetermination of the size of any holding is left to the land\r\nofficials, without defining any area limits. A holding which proves\r\ntoo small may be increased on appeal, and the boundaries are at all\r\ntimes made capable of adjustment. Holdings are first surveyed and\r\nvalued, then gazetted for application, and finally publicly allotted,\r\nafter full inquiry into the case of each applicant, by a Central\r\nBoard. The division and valuation of farms, in the absence of\r\nreliable data, is a work of great nicety and difficulty. The country\r\ncontains within its limits many districts which differ widely in\r\nsoil, vegetation, and climate. It is therefore impossible, in\r\ndeciding on the size of holdings, to follow any arbitrary rule; and\r\nto restrict survey to a maximum and minimum acreage would be fatal.\r\nThe only method is to ascertain from local evidence the carrying and\r\nproducing capacity of similar land, and so frame the boundaries of a\r\nfarm as to provide on such figures a reasonably good living for the\r\nclass of settler for whom it is intended. The danger of putting too\r\nhigh a price on land is not less great. If the current market price\r\nis taken it will in most instances be overvalued, and in any case it\r\nis a method without any justification in reason. The best solution is\r\nprobably the plan at present in use. Schedules have been prepared for\r\nthe different types of holding, in which the profits are calculated,\r\nusing as a guide the present price of stock and imported produce at\r\nthe coast to ensure against the inevitable fall in prices. Taking\r\nsuch estimated profits as a basis, the valuation is so fixed as to\r\ngive the settler, after all living expenses, annual payments to\r\nGovernment, probable loss of stock, and depreciation of plant have\r\nbeen written off, a clear profit of 12 per cent on his original\r\ncapital. From this figure some further deductions may fall to be made\r\nfor such disadvantages as unhealthiness of climate and excessive\r\ndistance from the conveniences of civilised life. In the absence of\r\nmore scientific data this seems to form as fair a basis in valuation\r\nas any man can expect.\r\n\r\nBut if early Australasian legislation erred in rigour, it also erred\r\nin laxity. The settler was often the nominee of a syndicate or a large\r\nrun-holder, and before the 1895 Act a class of professional selectors\r\nexisted. This system of _latifundia_ brought its own punishment. The\r\nrun-holder ruined the small selector. To pay the instalments on his\r\nmany selections he had recourse to the banks, which speedily ruined\r\nhim and took over his holdings. The banks in their turn ruined\r\nthemselves, chiefly through being obliged to pay instalments on land\r\nvalued at L1 per acre, of which the actual value for stock was less\r\nthan 5s. Again, the settler was compelled to improve the land at the\r\nrate of so many shillings per acre within a given time. This led to\r\ncheap fictitious improvements by which the letter of the law was\r\nsatisfied and the spirit evaded. The \"Settlers' Ordinance\" has certain\r\nstringent provisions to prevent such frustration of the true aims of\r\nsettlement. Subletting or transfer of any sort, except with Government\r\nconsent, is strictly forbidden till the tenant has acquired the\r\nfreehold. Residence for at least eight months in the year, unless a\r\nspecial dispensation is granted, is required during the same period.\r\nThe settler is compelled to build a satisfactory house and to fence\r\nhis holding within a given time. He is compelled to occupy it solely\r\nfor his own benefit, to cultivate according to the rules of good\r\nhusbandry (whatever that may mean), and the decision of the local Land\r\nCommissioner is the test by which he is judged. He is encouraged to\r\nimprove by the potent fact that the Government will advance pound for\r\npound against his improvements. But there are certain elastic\r\nprovisions to temper the rigour of such restrictions. The Commissioner\r\nof Lands is given a very wide dispensing power with regard to most\r\nconditions. Partnerships are allowed; settlers may reside together in\r\na village community; and the residence conditions may be temporarily\r\nfulfilled by a wife or child, to allow a settler in hard times to make\r\nmoney by his labour elsewhere. Special relief is provided during\r\nperiods of disease or drought by the cessation or diminution of the\r\nannual payments, and by advances in excess of the ordinary limits.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinance has been framed on experimental lines, leaving much to\r\nthe discretion of local officials (subject to an appeal to the Central\r\nBoard and thence to the High Court), and hesitating to dogmatise on\r\ndetails which are still unproved. But in spite of much which is\r\nempirical, one or two root principles are maintained. One is that a\r\nfair chance must be given to all to acquire the freehold, without\r\nwhich magic possibility the best men will not come forward. Another,\r\nand perhaps the most important of all, is that the payments to\r\nGovernment shall be so arranged as to be scarcely felt during the\r\nearly years when they are paid out of capital, and to rise to any\r\nconsiderable sum only when the holding is producing a revenue. The two\r\nchief forms of tenure are leasehold and purchase by instalments over a\r\nperiod of thirty years. The common form of lease is for five years,\r\nwith a possible extension for another two, and the rental may be at any\r\nrate (not exceeding 5 per cent) which the Commissioner of Lands thinks\r\nsuitable. This method will enable back-country to be taken up, to\r\nstart with, at a nominal rent; and it will also allow a settler on an\r\nunimproved stock-farm to devote the bulk of his capital to the\r\nnecessary stocking and improvements. At the end of the lease, or\r\nwithout any preliminary lease, the settler can begin to purchase his\r\nholding on the instalments system. By a payment of L5, 15s. per cent\r\nper annum on the gazetted valuation, principal and interest (which is\r\ncalculated at 4 per cent) will be wiped off in thirty years. But a\r\nsettler is permitted any time after ten years from the date of his\r\nfirst occupation to pay up the balance and acquire the full freehold.\r\nIn the case of preliminary leaseholders who take up a purchase\r\nlicence, the licence, so far as the ten years' period is concerned, is\r\nmade retrospective so as to date from the first day of the lease.\r\n\r\nSuch is a rough outline of the Government proposals. They aim only at\r\nmaking a beginning, and it is to the large private owner and the land\r\ncompany that we must look for the completion of the work. South\r\nAfrican agriculture can never be a Golconda like the Canadian\r\nwheat-lands of the West. But it is of inestimable value to the\r\ncountry in providing a background to the immense temporary mining\r\ndevelopment--a permanent asset, which will remain to South Africa's\r\ncredit when the gold-mines of the Rand are curiosities of history. In\r\nitself it is a sound investment, offering no glittering fortunes but\r\na steady and reasonable livelihood. No people can afford to develop\r\nsolely on industrial lines and remain a nation in the full sense of\r\nthe word, for in every commonwealth there is need of the rural forces\r\nof persistence to counteract the urban forces of change. All\r\nsettlement is necessarily a leap in the dark, but, so far as a\r\nproposal can be judged before it is put into practice, the present\r\nscheme offers good chances of success. There seems little doubt that\r\nit will receive full justice. The war spread the knowledge of the\r\ncountry to every cranny of the Empire. English and Scottish farmers'\r\nsons, Australian bushmen, Indian planters, farmers from New Zealand\r\nand Ontario, having fought for three years on the veld, have fallen\r\nin love with it and are willing to make it their home. No more\r\nsplendid chances for settlement have ever offered; for when the\r\nwastrels have been eliminated there remain many thousands of good\r\nmen, from whom a sturdy country stock could be created. There can be\r\nno indiscriminate gifts of land as in some colonies. The land is too\r\nvaluable, the political purpose too delicate and urgent, the need of\r\nnice discrimination in selection and careful fostering thereafter too\r\nimperative, to allow farms to be shaken up in a lucky-bag and\r\ndistributed to the first comers. The best men must be attracted, and\r\nassisted with advice and loans to the measure of success which is\r\npossible. It is the soundest form of political speculation, if done\r\nwith sober and clear-sighted purpose. The young men from home and the\r\ncolonies, to whom South Africa is a memory that can never die, turn\r\nnaturally towards it in search of a freer life and a larger prospect.\r\nOn the model farms which are being established in each district the\r\nproverbial \"younger sons of younger sons\" will be given a chance of\r\nlearning the requirements of the land, and so starting work on their\r\nown account with intelligence and economy. Some day--and may we all\r\nlive to see it!--there will be little white homesteads among trees,\r\nand country villages and moorland farms; cattle and sheep on a\r\nthousand hills where now only the wild birds cry; wayside inns where\r\nthe thirsty traveller can find refreshment; and country shows where\r\nJohn Smith and Johannes Smuts will compete amicably for the King's\r\npremiums. And if any one thinks this an unfounded hope, let him turn\r\nto some such book as Ogilby's 'Itinerarium Angliae,' where he will\r\nfind that in the closing years of the seventeenth century the arable\r\nand pastoral land in England scarcely amounted to half the area of\r\nthe kingdom, and the most fruitful orchards of Gloucestershire and\r\nWarwick were mere heath and swamp, and, as it seemed to an acute\r\nobserver, doomed to remain so.\r\n\r\nSettlement, indeed, is but one, though the most important, of the land\r\nproblems. An enlightened agricultural department, working in\r\nconjunction with local societies, can do much to unite the two races\r\nby conferring benefits which are common to both. The introduction of\r\npedigree stock to grade up the existing herds is a necessity which any\r\nBoer farmer will admit. So, too, are stringent regulations for the\r\nprevention of disease, experiments in new crops, field trials of new\r\nmachinery, and a provision for some form of agricultural training.\r\nCentral creameries and tobacco-factories would work wonders in\r\nincreasing the prosperity of certain districts. Something of that\r\ntireless vigilance and alert intelligence which has made the\r\nAgricultural Bureau of the United States famous, a spirit which brings\r\ninto agriculture the procedure and the exact calculation of a great\r\nbusiness house, is necessary to meet the not insuperable difficulties\r\nwhich now deter the timid, and to give farming a chance of development\r\ncommensurate with its political importance. It is only another case in\r\nwhich a South African question stands on a razor-edge, a narrow line\r\nseparating ample success from a melancholy failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SUBJECT RACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo question is more fraught with difficulties for the home philosopher\r\nthan this, but there is none on which practical men have made up their\r\nmind with such bitter completeness. The root of the trouble is that\r\nEngland and South Africa talk, and will continue to talk, in different\r\nlanguages on the matter. The Englishman, using the speech of\r\nconventional politics, seems to the colonist to talk academic\r\nnonsense; while the South African, speaking the rough and ready words\r\nof the practical man, appears as the champion of brutality and\r\ncoercion. The difficulties are so real that one cannot but regret that\r\nthey are complicated by verbal misunderstandings. There is no real\r\ndivergence of views on the native question: the distinction is rather\r\nbetween a seriously held opinion and a slipshod prejudice. \"Exeter\r\nHall\" is less the name of a party than of an attitude, as common among\r\nthe robust colonists as ever it was among the mild pietists of\r\nClapham. It consists in a disinclination to look simply on facts, to\r\nreason soberly, and to speak accurately,--a tendency to lap a question\r\nin turgid emotion. The man who consigns all native races to perdition\r\nin round terms, and declares that the only solution of the difficulty\r\nis to clear out the Kaffir, is as truly a votary of Exeter Hall as the\r\ngentle old lady to whom the aborigine is a model of primeval\r\ninnocence, whose only joy is the singing of missionary hymns.\r\n\r\nOut of the confusion of interests and issues two main problems emerge\r\nwhich may form useful guides in our inquiry. One is economic. What\r\npart are the native races to play in the labour-supply and the\r\nproduction of South Africa? what is to be their tenure of land? what\r\nis to be their economic destiny in face of the competition of modern\r\nlife and the industrial development of the country? The second is the\r\nmoral question, of which the political is one aspect. A coloured race\r\nliving side by side with a white people furnishes one of the gravest\r\nof moral cruces. The existence of a subject race on whatever terms is\r\napt to lead to the deterioration in moral and mental vigour of its\r\nmasters. Perpetual tutelage tends to this result; full social and\r\ncivic rights, on the other hand, lead to political anomalies and, too\r\noften, to the lowest forms of political chicanery. A doctrinaire\r\nidealism is fraught with dire social evils; but an obstinate\r\nmaintenance of the \"practical man's\" _status quo_ is apt to bring about\r\nthat very degeneration which justifies the doctrinaire. How to\r\nreconcile freedom of development for the native by means of spontaneous\r\nlabour, education, and social rights with the degree of compulsion\r\nnecessary to bring them into line with social and industrial needs, or,\r\nto put it shortly, how to keep the white man from deterioration without\r\nspoiling the Kaffir,--this is the kernel of the most insistent of South\r\nAfrican problems.\r\n\r\nThe native races south of the Zambesi present a curious problem to the\r\nstudent of primitive societies. All, or nearly all, of kindred race,\r\nthey are not autochthonous, and the date of their arrival in the\r\ncountry can in most cases be fixed within the last five centuries.\r\nFive centuries do not give a long title to a country, as savage titles\r\ngo, but even this period must be cut down in most cases, since the\r\nwars of the great Zulu kings scattered the other races about as from a\r\npepper-box, with the result that few tribes save the Zulus, some of\r\nthe Cape Colony Kaffirs, the Swazis, and small peoples like the\r\nBarolongs, can claim an occupation title of more than a hundred years.\r\nThis state of affairs, so rare in our dealings with savage peoples,\r\nhas, politically, both merits and defects. The absence of the\r\nautochthonous hold of the soil and of long-settled immovable\r\ntraditions of tribal life makes the native more malleable under the\r\nforces of civilisation. It is easier to break up the tribes and to\r\nacclimatise the Kaffir to new localities and new conditions. But this\r\nlack of a strong, settled, racial life makes it fatally easy for him\r\nto fall a victim to the vices of civilisation, and to come upon our\r\nhands as a derelict creature without faith or stamina, having lost his\r\nold taboos, and being as yet unable to understand the laws of the\r\nwhite man. This process of disintegration has been going on for a\r\ncentury, and the result is a clearly marked division. We have the\r\ntribal natives, who are still more or less strictly under the rule of\r\na chief, and subject to tribal laws sanctioned and enforced by the\r\nGovernments. The native population of the Transkeian territories in\r\nCape Colony, such as the Pondos, the Amaxosas, and the Tembus;\r\nBechuanaland, with the people of Khama, Bathoen, Sebele, and Linchwe;\r\nBasutoland; Zululand; the northern and eastern parts of the Transvaal\r\nunder such chiefs as Magata, 'Mpefu, and Siwasa; Swaziland; and the\r\nMatabele and Mashona tribes of the vast districts of Northern and\r\nSouthern Rhodesia are the main instances of this first class. The aim\r\nof the different Governments has always been to keep the tribal\r\norganisation intact, and, after eliminating certain tribal laws and\r\ncustoms which are inconsistent with the ideas of white men, to give\r\ntheir sanction to the remainder. Basutoland is a Crown colony; the\r\nTranskeian territories are a native reserve; Bechuanaland is a native\r\nprotectorate; in Rhodesia a number of native chiefs control large\r\ntracts of land under the Chartered Company's administration. Elsewhere\r\nthe tribes live in Government reserves, or in certain cases in\r\nlocations situated on private land. Between Pretoria and the Limpopo\r\nthere are dozens of small chieftains and chieftainesses, with tribes\r\nvarying in numbers from a hundred to several thousands. The second\r\nclass, the detribalised natives, are to be found scattered over the\r\nwhole country, notably in the western province of Cape Colony, and in\r\nthe vicinity of all South African towns. They live as a rule in\r\nlocations under municipal or Government supervision. In many cases\r\nsuch locations are far larger than those of a small chief; but their\r\ndistinguishing feature is that they are governed solely by the law of\r\nthe country or by municipal regulations framed for the purpose, and\r\nowe no allegiance to any chief or tribal system.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that for purposes of policy this distinction cannot\r\nmaintain its importance. The rule of the chief is being rapidly\r\nundermined by natural causes, and no taking thought can bolster it up\r\nfor ever. Education, too, and the closer settlement of the country by\r\nwhite men, are rapidly breaking down tribal customs and beliefs,\r\nwhich, as a rule, have more vitality than the isolated sentiment of\r\nallegiance. For us the real distinction is between the natives who\r\ncan be kept in large reserves or locations, whether tribal or\r\notherwise, and the floating native population, which is every day\r\ngrowing in numbers. Sooner or later we must face the problem of the\r\novercrowding of all reserves, and the consequent efflux of homeless\r\nand masterless men. The needs of progress, too, are daily tending to\r\nchange the tribal native into the isolated native attached to some\r\nindustry or other. Politically the question is, How far and on what\r\nlines the large reserves and locations can be best maintained, and\r\nwhat provision can be made for incorporating the overflow, which\r\nexists now and will soon exist in far greater numbers, on sane and\r\nrational lines in the body politic?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch being the main requirements of the problem, it remains to\r\nconsider the forms in which they present themselves to the ordinary\r\nman. For the working aspect of a question is generally very different\r\nfrom the form it takes in an academic analysis. The translation into\r\nthe terms of everyday life is conditioned by many accidental causes,\r\nso that to one section of the community the labour problem is the sole\r\none, to another the educational, to a third the social. It is\r\nimportant to realise that all are part of one question, and that no\r\nsingle one can be truly solved unless the whole is dealt with. This\r\nincompleteness of view, more than any other cause, has complicated the\r\nnative question, and produced spurious antagonisms, and policies which\r\nare apparently rival, but in reality are complementary.\r\n\r\nThe first is the grave difficulty which must always attend the\r\nexistence of a subject race. Slavery is the extreme form of the\r\nsituation, and in it we see the evils and dangers on a colossal scale.\r\nA subject population, to whom legal rights are denied, tends in the\r\nlong-run to degrade the value of human life, and to depreciate the\r\nmoral currency,--a result so deadly for true progress that the\r\nconsensus of civilised races has utterly condemned it. The denial of\r\nsocial and political rights is almost equally dangerous, since, apart\r\nfrom the risks of perpetual tutelage in a progressive community, there\r\nfollows necessarily a depreciation of those political truths upon\r\nwhich all free societies are based. Many honest men have clearly\r\nperceived this; but after the fashion of headstrong honesty, they have\r\nconfused the issues by an inaccurate use of words. Legal rights must\r\nbe granted, and since the law is the child of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of human justice, legal equality should follow. Social and\r\npolitical rights also must be given; but why social and political\r\nequality? The most embittered employer of native labour does not deny\r\nthat the black man should share certain social privileges, and be made\r\nto feel his place in the political organism, but he rightly denies\r\nthat rights mean equality of rights; while his doctrinaire opponent,\r\narguing from exactly the same premises, claims a foolish equality on a\r\nmisunderstanding of words. The essence of social and political\r\nequality must be a standard of education and moral and intellectual\r\nequipment, which can be roughly attributed to all members of the\r\ncommunity concerned. But in this case there can be no such common\r\nstandard. Between the most ignorant white man and the black man there\r\nis fixed for the present an impassable gulf, not of colour but of\r\nmind. The native is often quick of understanding, industrious,\r\ncuriously logical, but he lives and moves in a mental world incredibly\r\ndistant from ours. The medium of his thought, so to speak, is so\r\nunique that the results are out of all relation to ourselves.\r\nMentally he is as crude and naive as a child, with a child's curiosity\r\nand ingenuity, and a child's practical inconsequence. Morally he has\r\nnone of the traditions of self-discipline and order, which are\r\nimplicit, though often in a degraded form, in white people. In a word,\r\nhe cannot be depended upon as an individual save under fairly vigilant\r\nrestraint; and in the mass he forms an unknown quantity, compared with\r\nwhich a Paris mob is a Quaker meeting. With all his merits, this\r\ninstability of character and intellectual childishness make him\r\npolitically far more impossible than even the lowest class of\r\nEuropeans. High property or educational qualifications for the\r\nfranchise, or any other of the expedients of Europe, are logically out\r\nof place, though they were raised to the possession of a fortune and a\r\nuniversity degree; for the mind is still there, unaltered, though it\r\nmay be superficially ornamented. Give the native the full franchise,\r\nargues one class of observer, and he will in time show himself worthy\r\nof it, for in itself it is an education. On a strictly logical view it\r\nwould be as reasonable to put a child on a steam-engine as driver,\r\ntrusting that the responsibility of his position would be in itself an\r\neducation and would teach him the necessary art.\r\n\r\nSocial and political equality will seem to most men familiar with the\r\nsubject a chimera, but social and political rights the native must\r\nhave, and in most cases has already obtained. But unless such rights\r\nare carefully adjusted the absolute cleavage remains. We have two\r\nraces, physically different, socially incapable of amalgamation: if we\r\nmake the gulf final, there is no possibility of a united state; if we\r\nbridge it carelessly, the possibility is still more distant. We may\r\nscruple to grant rights, such as the political franchise, which are\r\nbased in the last resort on a common moral and intellectual standard;\r\nbut we can grant rights which are substantive and educative and\r\ncapable of judicious extension. The Glen Grey Act, as we shall see,\r\nmade a valuable experiment in securing to the native the social status\r\nwhich attends individual tenure of land. Some form of representation\r\nmight be devised, by which a chief might have a voice on a district\r\ncouncil, or a representative elected by an industrial location assist\r\nin local government. Such measures, joined with a rational system of\r\neducation, will leave the door open for the extension of rights till\r\nsuch time as the native has finally shown whether he is worthy of\r\nequality or condemned by nature to rank for ever as a subject race.\r\nThere are men, able men with the courage of their opinions, who see no\r\nhope in the matter, and who would segregate the natives in a separate\r\nterritory under British protection. The chief objection to this policy\r\nis that it is impossible. The native is in our midst, and we must\r\nface the facts. We have a chance to solve a burning question which no\r\nother nation has had, since, as in the United States, the matter has\r\neither been complicated by initial slavery, or, as also in the\r\nStates, a thoughtless plunge has been made into European doctrines of\r\nliberty, equality, and fraternity. If we patiently and skilfully\r\nbring to bear upon the black man the solvent and formative influences\r\nof civilisation, one of two things must happen. Either the native\r\nwill prove himself worthy of an equal share in the body politic; or,\r\nthe experiment having been honestly tried, he will sink back to his\r\nold place and gradually go the way of the Red Indian and the\r\nHottentot. For it is inevitable that civilisation, if wisely applied,\r\nmust either raise him or choke him,--raise him to the rank of equal\r\ncitizenship, or, by its hostility to his ineradicable qualities,\r\nprove a burden too heavy to support.\r\n\r\nThe second is the ever-recurring problem of labour. In an earlier\r\nchapter the economic aspect of the question has been discussed; for the\r\npresent we have to face that aspect which is connected with a native\r\npolicy. The Kaffir is fundamentally an agriculturist, and when his\r\nlands are well situated he reaps enough for his simple existence with a\r\nminimum of labour. If he is rich enough to have several wives, they do\r\nthe necessary picking and hoeing, and their lord and master sits in the\r\nshade of his hut and eats the bread of idleness. This was well enough\r\nin the old hunting and fighting days, when the male folk lived a\r\nstrenuous life in the pursuit of game and the slaughter of their\r\nneighbours. But with civilisation close to their gates, the old system\r\nmeans a degraded somnolent life for the man, and the continuance of a\r\nreal, though not necessarily unpleasant, form of slavery for the woman.\r\nAnd this in a country which is crying aloud for labour and development!\r\nTo be sure, the foregoing is not a complete picture of all Kaffir life,\r\nbut it is true of the larger reserves and the wealthier kraals. To most\r\nmen it is an offence that the native, who is saved by British power\r\nfrom insecurity of life and limb, should be allowed to remain, by the\r\nhappy accident of nature, an idler dependent only on the kindness of\r\nmother earth, multiplying his kind at an alarming rate, and untouched\r\nby the industrial struggle where his sinews are so sorely needed. The\r\nKaffir owes his existence to the white man; in return he should be\r\ncompelled to labour for hire and take his proper place in a world which\r\nhas no room for his vegetating habits. He holds his land by our favour,\r\nhe is protected from extinction by our arms, he enjoys the benefits of\r\nour laws; and he must pay for it all, not only in taxes but by a\r\nparticular tax, a certain quantity of labour. This mode of argument\r\nsounds so serenely reasonable that one is apt to miss the very\r\ndangerous political doctrine which underlies it. Stated shortly, it\r\nruns thus. Compulsory labour without payment is to be reprobated like\r\nall forms of _corvee_, but if we pay what we regard as a fair price and\r\nmake the compulsion indirect, then we get rid of such an objection.\r\nThis doctrine involves two principles which seem to me to be subversive\r\nof all social order, and in particular of that civilisation which they\r\nprofess to support. The Kaffir would be placed outside the play of\r\neconomic forces. His wages would be arbitrarily established on an\r\nartificial basis, unalterable save at the will of his white masters. In\r\nthe second place, compulsion by high taxation is not indirect\r\ncompulsion, but one of the most direct forms of coercion known to\r\nhistory. To constrain a man indirectly is to use unseen forces and\r\nhalf-understood conditions which, being unrealised, do not impair his\r\nconsciousness of liberty; but this is not the method which is proposed.\r\nA white man, it is argued, suffers want if he does not work. Well and\r\ngood,--so does the Kaffir; but the work which he does, unless he is\r\nrich enough to have it vicariously performed, is different in kind from\r\nthe work which others want him to do, and hence the trouble arises. To\r\nforce a man, black or white, to enter on labour for which he is\r\ndisinclined, is to rank him with beasts of burden, and prevent him, as\r\nan industrial creature, from ever attaining the conscious freedom which\r\nlabour bestows. The old truth, so often misapplied, that a man who does\r\nnot work shall not eat, is a statement of economic conditions to which\r\nthose who quote it in this connection would seek to do violence.\r\n\r\nBut such truisms do not exhaust the question. It is not the Kaffir who\r\nchiefly matters, for in his present stage of development he might be\r\nas well off one way as another; it is the white man's interests which\r\nmust decide. If the whole of Kaffirdom were sunk in a state of\r\nfeminine slavery and male indolence, violence might be done to\r\npolitical axioms with some show of reason; but the Kaffir is emerging\r\nfrom his savagery and has shown in more ways than one a capacity for\r\nindustrial development. But, taking the Kaffir on the lowest plane,\r\nwhat is to be the effect on the white population of South Africa if\r\nforced labour is to stereotype for ever a lower race, to which the\r\nfree selection of labour, the first requisite of progress, is denied?\r\n\"The safety of the commonwealth,\" wrote John Mackenzie, \"absolutely\r\ndemands that no hatches be battened down over the heads of any part of\r\nthe community.\" At the back of all the many excellent cases which have\r\nbeen made out for compulsory labour by high taxation, there lie the\r\nimmediate needs of the great gold industry--needs which it is now clear\r\ncan never be met in South Africa alone by any native legislation. An\r\ninstant industrial demand is apt to blind many good men for the moment\r\nto those wider truths, which on other occasions they are ready enough\r\nto assent to. The case has been further prejudiced for most people by\r\nthe bad arguments used on the native side, and the intolerable cant\r\nwith which obvious truths have been sicklied over. We need not concern\r\nourselves with the so-called degradation of Kaffir manhood implied in\r\ncompulsory labour, for such self-conscious manhood does not exist; but\r\nwe are very deeply concerned with the degradation of white manhood,\r\nwhich will inevitably follow any of the facile solutions which are\r\ncried in the market-place. If by violent methods economic laws are\r\nchecked in their play, a subject race in a low state of civilisation is\r\nchecked on the only side on which development can be reasonably looked\r\nfor. The harder and lower forms of toil will fall into Kaffir hands for\r\ngood; the white population will become an aristocracy based on a kind\r\nof slave labour; and with the abolition of an honest hierarchy of work,\r\ndegeneration will set in with terrible swiftness. It is a pleasing\r\ndream this, of a community of cultivated white men above the needs of\r\nsqualid or menial toil, but on such a dream no free nation was ever\r\nbuilt. The old tribal system is crumbling, and in a hundred years or\r\nless we shall see the Kaffirs abroad in the land, closely knit to all\r\nindustries and touching social and political life at countless points.\r\nIf they are a portion, however small, of the civic organism, there is\r\nhope for the future; but if they are a thing apart, denied the\r\ncommonest of all rights, and remaining in their present crude and\r\nstagnant condition, they will be a menace, political and moral, which\r\nno one can contemplate with equanimity. There are, indeed, only two\r\nentirely logical policies towards the native. Either remove him, bag\r\nand baggage, to some Central African reserve and leave him to fight his\r\nwars and live as he lived before the days of Tchaka, or bring him into\r\nclose and organic relation with those forces of a high civilisation\r\nwhich must inevitably mend or end him.\r\n\r\nThere is a third chief aspect in which the native problem presents\r\nitself to the ordinary man. The Kaffir, south of the Zambesi, already\r\noutnumbers the white man by fully five to one, and he increases with\r\nat least twice the rapidity. Most native reserves and locations are\r\novercrowded, the Kaffir is being driven on to private land as an\r\nunauthorised squatter, and the floating population in and around the\r\ntowns is daily increasing. What is to be the end of this fecundity?\r\nLiving on little, subject apparently to none of the natural or\r\nprudential checks on over-population, there seems a real danger of\r\nblack ultimately swamping white by mere gross quantity. In any case\r\nthere will soon be a grave economic crisis, for, unless prompt\r\nmeasures are adopted, a large loose vagabondage will grow up all over\r\nthe land. It is to be noted that this danger is the converse of the\r\ntwo problems we have already discussed. They referred to the\r\nstereotyping of the Kaffir races as a settled agricultural people out\r\nof line with industrial progress; this concerns the inevitable\r\nbreak-up of the old agricultural condition by mere excess of\r\npopulation and the difficulty of dealing with the overflow. This\r\ncomplementary character which the problems assume is one of the most\r\nhopeful features of the case. Natural forces are bringing the Kaffir\r\nto our hands. The _debacle_ of his old life is turning him upon the\r\nworld to be formed and constrained at our pleasure. The field is clear\r\nfor experiment, and it behoves us to make up our minds clearly on the\r\nforms which the experiment must take.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate the results of the preceding pages. The central\r\nproblem is how to bring the native races under the play of civilising\r\nforces, so that they may either approve themselves as capable of\r\nincorporation in the body politic, or show themselves eternally\r\nincapable, in which case history would lead us to believe that they\r\nwill gradually disappear. To effect this vital experiment, no rigid\r\neconomic or social barrier should be placed between them and the white\r\ninhabitants. Since the old tribal organisation is breaking up, the\r\nground is being rapidly prepared for the trial. It is our business,\r\ntherefore, to consider how best the system of tribes and reserves can\r\nbe maintained, so long as there is in it the stuff of life, and what\r\nnew elements can be introduced which will make its fall more safe and\r\ngradual; and, in the second place, to devise ways and means for\r\ndealing with the rapidly increasing loose native population, for\r\nreplacing the former tribal traditions with some rudiments of\r\ncivilised law, and for leaving an open door for such development as\r\nmay be within their capacity. It will be convenient to look at ways\r\nand means under three heads. There is, first, the general question of\r\ntaxation, which is common to all. There is, secondly, the problem of\r\nthe larger reserves, and the maintenance, so far as is desirable, of\r\nthe old rural life, with the kindred questions of land tenure, of\r\nlocal government, of surplus population, and of labour. And, finally,\r\nthere is the problem of the class which in the last resort is\r\ndestined to be most numerous, the wholly non-tribal and unattached\r\nnatives, whose mode of life must be created afresh and controlled by\r\nGovernment. This is the most difficult problem, since such natives\r\nare peculiarly exposed to the solvents of white civilisation, and\r\neverything depends upon the method in which the solvents are used.\r\n\r\nThe native is, for the most part, under special taxes. In certain\r\nparts of Cape Colony and Natal the fiscal system is in practice the\r\nsame for black and white, but for the purposes of this inquiry the\r\nnative who has adopted the white man's life may be disregarded. In\r\nCape Colony the hut tax is 10s. per annum, whether the hut is situated\r\non private or Crown lands, and on locations within municipalities a\r\nsimilar municipal tax is paid. In Natal the hut tax is 14s., in\r\nBasutoland L1, in Rhodesia 10s., and in the Transvaal and Orange River\r\nColony 10s. under the old _regime_. In Natal, the Orange River Colony,\r\nthe Transvaal, and Rhodesia, there was also a native pass law, under\r\nwhich certain sums were charged on travelling passes, varying from 6d.\r\nin the Orange River Colony to 2s. per month in the mining areas of the\r\nTransvaal. It is unnecessary to go into the numerous details of native\r\ntaxation, which within narrow limits are constantly varied, but it is\r\nworth while to look at two instances which may be taken as the extreme\r\ntypes of such taxation, the Transvaal under the former Government and\r\nthe districts of Cape Colony subject to the Glen Grey Act. In the\r\nTransvaal the natives for the most part are tribal, and the system of\r\ntaxation was based on tribal considerations; but the bulk of the\r\nrevenue under the Pass Law came from the large fluctuating population\r\nof natives at work on the mines. Under the old Government the ordinary\r\nnative paid 10s. as hut tax, L2 as capitation fee, with sundry other\r\ncharges for passes, &c., which brought the whole amount which might be\r\nlevied up to fully L4. The tax was loosely collected, but on the whole\r\nthe taxation per head was reasonably high. One of the first acts of\r\nthe new administration was to consolidate all native taxes in one\r\ngeneral poll tax of L2, with a further charge of L2 per wife for\r\nnatives who had more than one. The pass fee was also charged upon the\r\nemployer in districts where it fell to be levied. The net result,\r\ntherefore, is that for a native, who is the husband of not more than\r\none wife, the sum payable yearly is about L3, made up of the poll tax\r\nand the registration fee. A native may have to pay more than the old\r\nGovernment exacted, but if he pleases he can pay less. In the\r\ndistricts under the Glen Grey Act individual ownership of land is\r\nencouraged, and the native who has attained to such tenure is\r\npractically in the position of a white citizen--that is, he pays no\r\nhut tax or poll tax, and his contributions to revenue consist in the\r\npayment of such rates as his district council or the Transkeian\r\nGeneral Council may levy. For the native who holds no land either on\r\nquit-rent or freehold title, there is a labour tax of 10s. per annum,\r\nwhich he can avoid by showing that he has been at work outside the\r\ndistrict for a period of three months during the previous year, and\r\nfrom which he can gain complete exemption by showing that at some time\r\nhe has worked for a total period of three years. Such a tax is not a\r\ncompulsory labour tax, but should rather be regarded as a modification\r\nof the hut tax, which can be remitted as a bonus on outside labour.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the two forms of taxation is obvious, the one\r\nbeing a special and peculiar type, the other a modification of the\r\ngeneral fiscal system of the colony. It is to the latter type that all\r\nsystems of native taxation must tend to approximate. There are certain\r\nobvious objections to the hut tax, of which the chief is that it leads\r\nto overcrowding and bad sanitation, and prevents young men from\r\nbuilding huts of their own; and perhaps it would be well if,\r\nfollowing the new Transvaal precedent, all native taxes were\r\nconsolidated into one comprehensive poll tax. But, speaking generally,\r\nnatives are not heavily taxed[28] having regard to their wage-earning\r\ncapacity, though hitherto the Customs have been unduly hard upon their\r\nsimple commodities. In the Transvaal, for example, there is little\r\ndoubt that the native population could bear for revenue purposes in\r\nmost years a poll tax of L3 per head. This might be reduced in case of\r\nnatives in industrial employment, in consideration of the fact that\r\nsuch natives contribute otherwise to revenue through the Pass Law. It\r\nis one of the ironies of this South African problem that increased and\r\nreasonable taxation for revenue purposes will continue to be\r\nidentified in many minds with compulsory labour through high taxation.\r\nThe two things are as wide apart as the poles. The native, in return\r\nfor protection and good government, is required to pay a certain sum\r\nper annum calculated solely on fiscal needs and his earning capacity.\r\nThat is the only basis of native taxation; but when the sum has been\r\nfixed, it may be expedient as a matter of policy to reduce the tax in\r\nthe case of natives working under an employer, partly because such\r\nnatives contribute to the Exchequer in another way, and partly as a\r\nbonus to encourage outside labour. But the general form of taxation\r\nmight well be altered, slowly and cautiously, as the time ripened. The\r\nhut tax might be gradually transmuted into a form of rent which, as in\r\nthe Glen Grey districts, could be lowered as a bonus on outside\r\nlabour, and the extension of local government might provide for the\r\nrating of locations and reserves on some system common to all\r\ndistricts. Taxation may have an educative force, and to ask from the\r\nnative a contribution for something of which the purpose is apparent\r\nand the justification obvious, is to bestow on him a kind of freedom.\r\nIt is the first step to taxation with representation to provide that\r\ntaxation should be accompanied by understanding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second question is that of existing reserves and the possibility\r\nand method of their maintenance. In the case of many the problem is\r\nstill simple. Basutoland, the chief tribes of the Bechuanaland\r\nProtectorate and Southern Rhodesia, Swaziland, Zululand, the races of\r\nthe north and north-eastern Transvaal, and a considerable part of the\r\nTranskeian territories, will find for many years protected tribal\r\ngovernment suitable to their needs. Tribal customs and laws, in so far\r\nas they are not _contra bonos mores_, are recognised by the protecting\r\nGovernments, and given effect to by any white courts which may have\r\njurisdiction in the district. The old modes of land tenure, the\r\nsuccession to the chieftainship, the tribal religion, if any exists,\r\nshould be given the sanction of the sovereign Power till such time as\r\nthey crumble from their own baselessness. The disintegrating forces\r\nare many and potent. Taxation will compel the acquisition of wealth\r\nother than in kind, and will therefore strengthen existing trade, and,\r\nif gradually modified in character till it approach a rating system,\r\nwill replace the tribe by the district as a local unit. The growth of\r\npopulation will compel a certain overflow, which must either be\r\naccommodated on new land under special conditions, or must go to\r\nswell the general industrial community. Education, the greatest of\r\nall disintegrators, is loosening slowly the old ties, and is\r\nincreasing the wants of the native by enlarging his mental horizon.\r\nOutside labour, whether undertaken from love of novelty or from sheer\r\neconomic pressure, leaves its indelible mark on the labourer. The\r\nKaffir who has worked for two years in Kimberley or Johannesburg may\r\nseem to have returned completely to his old stagnant life, but there\r\nis a new element at work in him and his kindred, a new curiosity, a\r\nweakening of his regard for his traditional system. Agriculture\r\nitself, which has hitherto been the mainstay of his conservatism, is\r\nrapidly becoming a force of revolution. Formerly no self-respecting\r\nnative would engage in cultivation, leaving such tasks to his women;\r\nbut a native who would not touch pick or hoe is ready enough to work a\r\nplough, if he is so fortunate as to possess one. The growth of wealth\r\nand a spirit of enterprise among the tribes leads to improved tillage,\r\nand once the native is content to labour himself in the fields, his\r\nold scheme of society is already crumbling.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to natural solvents, there is one which we might well\r\napply in our own interest against the time when the tribal system\r\nshall have finally disappeared. Any form of political franchise,\r\nhowever safeguarded, is in my opinion illogical and dangerous. It is\r\ninequitable to create barriers which are themselves artificial, but it\r\nis both inequitable and impolitic to disregard natural barriers when\r\nthe basis of our politics is a presumed natural equality. But it may\r\nbe possible to admit the Kaffir to a share in self-government without\r\ngiving any adherence to the doctrine involved in a grant of a national\r\nfranchise. Local government is still in its infancy all over South\r\nAfrica, but the common type is some form of urban or district council.\r\nThe questions which such councils discuss do not involve high\r\nconsiderations of statescraft, but simple practical matters, such as\r\nroads and bridges, sanitary restrictions, precautions against stock\r\ndiseases, and market rules. Supposing that in any district there\r\nexists a tribe or a location sufficiently progressive and orderly, I\r\nsee no real difficulty in bringing the chief or induna sooner or later\r\ndirectly or indirectly into the local council. It is a matter on\r\nwhich it is idle to dogmatise, being one of the many questions on\r\nwhich South Africa must say the last word, and being further\r\ndependent on the status of the natives in each district; but on a\r\nnominated or elective council a native, or a white member with\r\nnatives in his constituency, might do valuable work in assisting with\r\nmatters in which natives were largely concerned. A native who cannot\r\nreasonably be asked to decide on questions such as fiscal reform or\r\nmilitary organisation, may be very well fitted to advise, as a large\r\nstock-holder, on precautionary measures against rinderpest. If such a\r\nstep is ever taken--and the present exclusive attitude of South\r\nAfrica is rather a sign of the growing solidarity of the community\r\nthan an index of a permanent conviction--an advance of enormous\r\nimport will have been made in that branch of native education in\r\nwhich we are almost powerless to move directly, namely, his training\r\nas a responsible citizen.\r\n\r\nAs the tribal system breaks down from whatever cause, the tribesmen must\r\ndo one of three things--either settle on the land on new conditions, or\r\nlive permanently in the service of employers, or swell the loose\r\npopulation of town and country. The second course does not concern us,\r\nbeing a matter for the private law of master and servant. But in each of\r\nthe other courses the State is profoundly interested. For the sake of\r\nthe future it is necessary to have the existing reserves thoroughly\r\nexamined, for, since the fluctuations of native populations are very\r\ngreat, many are too small for their present occupants and a few are too\r\nspacious. Majajie's location in Zoutpansberg, and one or two of the\r\nreserves on the western border of the Transvaal, may be quoted as\r\ninstances of tribes which have shrunk from the original number on\r\nwhich the grant of land was based. In such cases the land might\r\nreasonably be curtailed, since it is still Crown land held in trust\r\nfor the natives' use, and not private land purchased by the chiefs\r\nthemselves. But it is more usual to find locations far too narrow, and\r\nthe result in many parts is that a certain number of natives who have\r\nbeen compelled to leave their old reserves are farming private lands\r\non precarious and burdensome terms, or are squatting on Crown lands\r\nwith no legal tenure at all. A law of the late Transvaal Government\r\n(No. 21 of 1895) made it illegal to have more than five native\r\nhouseholds on one private farm; but this law, like many others which\r\nconflicted with the interests of the governing class, was quietly\r\nallowed to become a dead letter. There are men to-day who have a\r\nhundred and more native families on a farm, paying often exorbitant\r\nrents either in money or in forced labour, and liable to be turned\r\nadrift at a moment's notice. The old Boer system was to allow natives\r\nto squat on land in return for six months' labour; but this mode of\r\npayment is never satisfactory with a Kaffir, who soon forgets the\r\ntenure on which he holds his land, regards it as his own, and makes\r\nevery attempt to evade his tenant's service. The whole position is\r\nunsatisfactory, the master being cumbered with unwilling and often\r\nworthless labour, the tenant subject to a capricious rent and a\r\npermanent possibility of eviction. In the interests of both white and\r\nblack it is desirable to end this anomaly. Some form of the Squatters'\r\nLaw might be re-enacted and enforced, a farmer being allowed a\r\nreasonable number of native families, who give work for wages and pay\r\na fair rent for their land. The balance might well be accommodated as\r\ntenants on such portions of Crown land as are suitable for Kaffirs and\r\nincapable of successful white settlement. Such lands exist in the\r\nparts where the native population is densest, as in the northern and\r\neastern districts of the Transvaal. The situation affords an\r\nopportunity for the Government policy towards outside labour. If the\r\nrent per holding were fixed at some figure like L10 (which is less\r\nthan many natives pay to private owners) it might be reduced to L5, if\r\na certain proportion of the males of a household went out to labour\r\nfor a part of the year in the towns or in some rural employment other\r\nthan farming. Such a policy would give immediate relief to the really\r\nserious congestion in many districts, would establish a better system\r\nof native tenure, and would pave the way for a closer connection\r\nbetween the industrial native and the country kraal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wholly detribalised native is a more important problem, because he\r\nrepresents the type of what the Kaffir will in some remote future\r\nbecome--a man who has forgotten his race traditions, and has become an\r\nunpopular attache of the white community. Towards other natives our\r\npolicy must be only to maintain an amended _status quo_, but for him\r\nwe must make an effort at construction. It is no business of mine to\r\nframe policies, but only to sketch, roughly and imperfectly, the\r\nconditions of the problem which the constructive statesman (and South\r\nAfrica will long have need of constructive statesmen) must face.\r\nIndividual tenure of land--and by this is not necessarily meant\r\nfreehold, even under the Glen Grey restrictions as to alienation, for\r\na long lease may be more politic and equally attractive[29]--and the\r\nspread of education and commerce will work to the same effect in the\r\nrural districts as industrial employment in the towns. But for the\r\npresent the towns furnish the gravest problem--how to make adequate\r\nprovision for the increasing native population, which is neither\r\nliving permanently in the households of white masters nor working in\r\nthe mines under a time contract. It is desirable to have locations for\r\nnatives, as it is fitting to provide bazaars for Asiatics, since the\r\nnative should be concentrated both for administrative and educational\r\npurposes. Those municipal locations, which already exist in many\r\ntowns, will have to be taken vigorously in hand. Something must\r\nreplace the biscuit-tin shanties where the native, ignorant of\r\nsanitation, lives, under more wretched conditions, what is practically\r\nthe life of a country kraal, and with the reform of their habitations\r\na new attraction to industry will exist for the better class of\r\nKaffir. It is a common mistake to class all natives together, a\r\nmistake which a little knowledge of South African ethnology and\r\nhistory would prevent. Many have highly developed instincts of\r\ncleanliness, and much race pride, and will not endure to be huddled in\r\nsqualid locations with the refuse of inferior tribes. Given decent\r\ndwelling-places, education on rational lines, and after a time,\r\nperhaps, a share in municipal government, might lay the foundation of\r\na civic life and an industrial usefulness far more lasting than can be\r\nexpected from casual labourers brought from distant homes for a few\r\nmonths' work, and carried back again.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa has in her day possessed one man who desired to look at\r\nthings as they are, a murky and distorted genius at times, but at his\r\nbest inspired with something of a prophet's insight. The fruit of Mr\r\nRhodes' native administration was the Glen Grey Act, which still\r\nremains the only attempt at a constructive native policy. It is hard\r\nenough to govern, but sometimes, looking to the iron necessities in\r\nthe womb of time, it is wise to essay a harder task, and build. We\r\nmust keep open our communications with the future, and begin by\r\nrecognising the fundamental truths, which are apt to get a little\r\ndimmed by the dust of the political arena. The first is that the\r\nnative is psychologically a child, and must be treated as such; that\r\nis, he is in need of a stricter discipline and a more paternal\r\ngovernment than the white man. South Africa has already recognised\r\nthis by the remarkable consensus of opinion which she has shown in the\r\nprohibition of the sale of intoxicants to coloured people. He is as\r\nincapable of complete liberty as he is undeserving of an unintelligent\r\ncensure. The second is that he is with us, a permanent factor which\r\nmust be reckoned with, in spite of the advocates of a crude Bismarckian\r\npolicy; and because his fortunes are irrevocably linked to ours, it is\r\nonly provident to take care that the partnership does not tend to our\r\nmoral and political disadvantage. For there is always in the distance a\r\ngrim alternative of over-population resulting in pauperism and anarchy,\r\nor a hard despotism producing the moral effects which the conscience of\r\nthe world has long ago in slave systems diagnosed and condemned. There\r\nare three forces already at work which, if judiciously fostered, will\r\nachieve the experiment which South Africa is bound to make, and either\r\nraise the Kaffir to some form of decent citizenship, or prove to all\r\ntime that he is incapable of true progress. Since we are destroying the\r\nold life, with its moral and social codes and its checks upon economic\r\ndisaster, we are bound to provide an honest substitute. The forces\r\nreferred to are those of a modified self-government, of labour, and of\r\nan enlightened education. The first is an experiment which must be\r\nundertaken very carefully, unless our case is to be prejudiced from the\r\noutset. I have given reasons for the view that a political franchise\r\nfor the native is logically unjustifiable; but on district councils and\r\nwithin municipal areas the native, wherever he is living under\r\nconditions of tolerable decency and comfort, might well play a part in\r\nhis own control. It may be doomed to failure or it may be the beginning\r\nof political education, but it is an experiment we can scarcely fail to\r\nmake. In labour, short of a crude compulsion, every means must be used\r\nto bring the Kaffir within the industrial circle. We shall be assisted\r\nin our task by many secret forces, but it should be our business so to\r\nframe our future native legislation as to place a bonus on labour\r\noutside the kraal. The matter is so intimately bound up with the\r\nwellbeing of the whole population that there is less fear of neglect\r\nthan of undue and capricious haste.\r\n\r\nA word remains to be said on native education. In this province there\r\nis much need of effective Government control, since in the past the\r\nenergies of educationalists have tended to flow in mistaken channels\r\nor be dissipated over too wide an area. The native is apt to learn in\r\na kind of parrot fashion, and this aptitude has misled many who have\r\ndevoted their lives to his interests. But in the present state of his\r\nculture what we are used to call the \"humanities\" have little\r\neducational importance. At the best the result is to turn out native\r\npastors and schoolmasters in undue numbers, unfortunate men who have\r\nno proper professional field and no footing in the society to which\r\ntheir education might entitle them. It is a truth which the wiser sort\r\nof missionaries all over the world are now recognising in connection\r\nwith the propagation of Christianity--that the ground must be slowly\r\nprepared before the materialist savage mind can be familiarised with\r\nthe truths of a spiritual religion. Otherwise the result is a glib\r\nconfession of faith which ends in scandal. The case is the same with\r\nwhat we call \"secondary education.\" The teaching of natives, if it is\r\nto produce any practical good, should, to begin with, be confined to\r\nthe elements and to technical instruction. The native mind is very\r\nready to learn anything which can be taught by concrete instances, and\r\nmost forms of manual dexterity, even some of the more highly skilled,\r\ncome as easily to him as to the white man. When the boys are taught\r\neverywhere carpentry and ironwork and the rudiments of trade, and the\r\ngirls sewing and basket-making and domestic employments, a far more\r\npotent influence will have been introduced than the Latin grammar or\r\nthe primer of history. The wisest missionary I have ever met had a\r\nstation which was a kind of ideal city for order and industry, with\r\ncarpenters' and blacksmiths' shops, a model farm, basket-making,\r\norchards, and dairies. \"By these means,\" he said, \"I am teaching my\r\nchildren the elements of religion, which are honesty, cleanliness, and\r\ndiscipline.\" \"And dogma?\" I asked. \"Ah,\" he said, \"as to dogma, I\r\nthink we must be content for the present with a few stories and\r\nhymns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  [28]  It is proposed to assimilate native taxation in Southern\r\n        Rhodesia to the system now in vogue in the Transvaal,\r\n        and impose a poll tax of L2, with a tax of 10s. for\r\n        each extra wife. In the Orange River Colony it is\r\n        proposed to raise the hut tax to L1.\r\n\r\n  [29]  The question of native ownership of land in the new\r\n        colonies is not very clear. In the Transvaal land was\r\n        generally held in trust for natives by the Native\r\n        Commissioners; but apparently half-castes could own\r\n        land, and Asiatics under certain restrictions. In the\r\n        Orange River Colony ownership by Asiatics is forbidden;\r\n        but certain native tribes, such as the Barolongs in\r\n        Maroka, and the Oppermans at Jacobsdaal, as well as\r\n        half-castes and the people known as the Bastards, were\r\n        allowed freehold titles, subject to certain restrictions\r\n        on alienation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nJOHANNESBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a delicate matter to indulge in platitudes about a city. For a\r\ncity is an organism more self-conscious than a state, and a personality\r\nless robust than an individual. Comments which, if made on a nation,\r\nwould be ignored, and on an individual would be tolerated, awaken angry\r\nreprisals when directed to a municipal area. The business is still more\r\ndelicate when the city concerned is not yet quite sure of herself.\r\nJohannesburg is a city, though she has no cathedral to support the\r\nconventional definition, or royal warrant to give her dignitaries\r\nprecedence; but she is a city still on trial, sensitive, ambitious,\r\nprofoundly ignorant of her own mind. Her past has been short and\r\ncheckered. She has done many things badly and many things well; she has\r\nbeen the target for universal abuse, and still with one political party\r\nfills the honourable post of whipping-boy in chief to the Empire. Small\r\nwonder if her people are a little dazed--proud of themselves, hopeful\r\nof her future, but far from clear what this future is to be.\r\n\r\nAt first sight she has nothing to commend her. The traveller who drags\r\nhis stiff limbs from the Cape mail sees before him a dusty road, some\r\ntin-roofed shanties, with a few large new jerry buildings humped\r\nabove them: a number of straggling dusty pines and gums, a bit of bare\r\nhillside in the distance, and a few attenuated mine chimneys.\r\nEverything is new, raw, and fortuitous, as uncivilised and certainly\r\nas ugly as the desert ridge on which an old Bezuidenhout planted his\r\nhomestead. The chief streets do not efface the first impression. Some\r\nbuildings are good, but the general effect is mean. The place looks as\r\nif it had sprung up, like some Western township, in a night, and as if\r\nthe original builders had been in such a desperate hurry to get done\r\nwith it that they could not stop to see that one house kept line with\r\nits neighbours. It is a common South African defect, but there is here\r\nno _mise-en-scene_ to relieve the ugliness. Looking at Pretoria from\r\nthe hills one sees a forest of trees, with white towers and walls\r\nrising above the green. The walls may be lath and plaster, but the\r\ngeneral effect is as pretty as the eye could wish. For Johannesburg\r\nthere is no such salvation. Looked at from one of her many hills, the\r\nmeanness and irregularity are painfully clear. She has far more trees\r\nthan Pretoria, but she is so long and sprawling that the bare ribs\r\nhave pushed aside their covering. An extended brickfield is the first\r\nimpression: a prosperous powder-factory is the last.\r\n\r\nYet in her way she has many singular beauties. Doubtless in time to\r\ncome she will be so great that she will contain more cities than one\r\nin her precincts, and there may well be a residential quarter as fine\r\nas any in Europe. The Rand is a long shallow basin with hilly rims,\r\nwithin which lie the mines and the working city. The southern rim\r\nshelves away into featureless veld, but the northern sinks sharply on\r\na plain, across forty miles of which rise the gaunt lines of the\r\nMagaliesberg. What fashionable suburb has a vista of forty miles of\r\nwild country, with a mountain wall on the horizon? Below on the flats\r\nthere are many miles of pine woods, valleys and streams and homesteads,\r\nand the Pretoria road making a bold trail over a hill. In winter the\r\nhorizon is lit with veld-fires; in summer and spring there are the wild\r\nsunsets of the veld and soft mulberry gloamings. The slope behind shuts\r\nout the town and the mine chimneys, and yet the whole place is not\r\nthree miles from Market Square. Whatever happens, nothing can harm the\r\nlucky dwellers on the ridge. Though the city creep ten miles into the\r\nplain beneath, there is still ample prospect; and not all the fumes\r\nfrom all the industries on earth can spoil the sharp vigour of the\r\nwinds blowing clean from the wilds.\r\n\r\nBut the place has not yet found itself. The city proper is still for\r\nthe future; for the present we have a people. What the real conception,\r\ncurrent in England, of this people may be it is not easy to tell, the\r\nwhole matter having been transferred to party politics, and presented,\r\nplain or coloured, to partisan spectators. So we are given every\r\npossible picture, from that of Semitic adventurers nourishing the fires\r\nof life on champagne, to that of a respectable and thoroughly\r\ndomesticated people, morbidly awake to every sentiment of Empire.\r\n\"Judasburg,\" \"the New Jerusalem,\" \"the Golden City,\" and a variety of\r\nother pet names, show that to the ordinary man, both in and out of\r\nparties, there is something bizarre and exotic about the place. And yet\r\nno conception could be more radically false. Johannesburg is first and\r\nforemost a colonial city, an ordinary colonial city save for certain\r\nqualities to be specified later. You will see more Jews in it than in\r\nMontreal or Aberdeen, but not more than in Paris; and any smart London\r\nrestaurant will show as large a Semitic proportion as a Johannesburg\r\nclub. For a \"Golden City\" it is not even conspicuously vulgar. For one\r\nfellow in large checks, diamonds, and a pink satin tie, you will meet\r\nfifty quietly dressed, well-mannered gentlemen. A man may still be a\r\nbeggar to-day and rich to-morrow, but less commonly and in a different\r\nsense. The old mining-camp, California-cum-Ballarat character of the\r\ngold industry on the Rand has utterly passed away. Gold-mining has\r\nceased to be a speculation, and has become a vast and complicated\r\nindustry, employing at high salaries the first engineering talent of\r\nthe world. The prominent mine-owner is frequently a man of education,\r\nalmost invariably a man of high ability. In few places can you find men\r\nof such mental vigour, so eagerly receptive of new ideas, so keenly\r\nawake to every change of the financial and political worlds of Europe.\r\nThe blackguard alien exists, to be sure, but he is rarely felt, and the\r\nhand of the law is heavy upon him. That Johannesburg is made up wholly\r\nof adventurers and Whitechapel Jews is the first piece of cant to clear\r\nthe mind of.\r\n\r\nThe second is the old slander that the people think of nothing but the\r\nmarket, are cowardly and selfish, indifferent to patriotism and\r\nhonour. It says little for Englishmen that they could believe this\r\nfalsehood of a place where the greater part of the inhabitants are\r\nEnglish. The war meant dismal sufferings for the artisan class, who\r\nhad to live in expensive coast lodgings or comfortless camps; and it\r\nis to the credit of Johannesburg that she stood nobly by her refugees.\r\nThe old Reform movement was not a fortunate enterprise, but there was\r\nno lack of courage in it; and even those who may grudge the attribute\r\ncan scarcely deny it to the same men at Elandslaagte and Ladysmith.\r\nThere have been various sorts of irregular regiments--many good, some\r\nbad, one or two the very scum of the earth; but no irregular soldiers\r\nshowed, from first to last, a more cool and persistent courage than\r\nthe men who for years had sought to achieve by persuasion an end which\r\nrequired a more summary argument. The truth is that the Johannesburger\r\nhas suffered by being contrasted, as the typical townsman, with the\r\nBoer, as the typical countryman. Dislike the particular countryman as\r\nwe may, we have at the back of our minds a feeling that somehow, in\r\nGeorge Eliot's phrase, an unintelligible dialect is a guarantee for\r\ningenuousness, and that slouching shoulders indicate an upright\r\ndisposition. It is Johannesburg's misfortune that this anomalous\r\ncontrast should be forced on us. It is as if a sixteenth-century\r\npeasant, without enterprise, without culture, wholly un-modern and\r\nun-political, believing stoutly in a sombre God, were living side by\r\nside with a race of _intellectuels_, scientists, and successful\r\nmerchants. Whatever reason or, as in this case, patriotism may say,\r\nmost men have a sneaking fondness for the peasant.\r\n\r\nIn every community which is worth consideration we find two forces\r\npresent in some degree--the force of social persistence and the force\r\nof social movement. Critics of Johannesburg would have us believe that\r\nthe second only is to be found, and in its crudest form: the truth is\r\nthat, considering the history of the place and its novelty, the first\r\nis remarkably strong. The point is worth labouring at the risk of\r\ntediousness. It must be some little while before a mining city shakes\r\noff the character of a mining camp. Men will long choose to live\r\nuncomfortably in hotels and boarding-houses, looking for their reward\r\non their home-coming, discomfort none the less unpleasant because it\r\nis tempered with unmeaning luxury. To its inhabitants the place is no\r\ncontinuing city,--only a camp for the adventurer, who, when he has\r\nmade the most of it, returns to enjoy the fruits of his labour in his\r\nown place. And then, after many years, there suddenly comes a day when\r\na man here and a man there realise that they have lost the desire to\r\nreturn: they like the place, settle down, and found a home. Whenever\r\nthere is any fair proportion of this class in a mining city, then we\r\nhave a force of social persistence. The tendency is found in every\r\nclass of society. At one time the miner from Wales or Cornwall saved\r\nhis earnings and returned home; now he has his wife out and settles\r\nfor good. There is also a large commercial class, traders and small\r\nmanufacturers, who belong as thoroughly to the place as the South\r\nAfrican born. And with the more educated classes the same thing is\r\ntrue. The price of building sites in the suburbs and the many pretty\r\nhouses which have arisen show that even for this class, which was most\r\nnomadic in its habits, domesticity has become a fact.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the cardinal achievement of Johannesburg, an unparalleled\r\nachievement in so short a career. She has in a few years changed\r\nherself from a camp to a city, acquired a middle class and a decent\r\nartisan class,--both slow and difficult growths,--and shown a knack of\r\nabsorbing any species of alien immigrant and putting them on the way\r\nto respectable citizenship. She has but to point to this solid\r\nachievement as a final answer to the foolish calumnies of her enemies.\r\nThe mines are her staple industry, but the mines, so far as she is\r\nconcerned, are an industry and not a speculation; and she is creating\r\na dozen other industries of quite a different character, and may well\r\ncreate a hundred more. She has become a municipality, with all the\r\ntraits, good and bad, of a nourishing municipality at home. She has\r\nbecome colonial, too,--as colonial, though in a different way, as\r\nMelbourne or Wellington. Formerly she was a mixture of every European\r\ncapital plus a little of the Dutch dorp: now she is English in\r\nessence, the most English of all South African towns.\r\n\r\nThe future of the chief municipality of South Africa cannot be without\r\ninterest, for most problems will concern her first, and receive from\r\nher their colour and character, and, possibly, their answer. She must\r\ncontinue to represent one of the two foremost interests, and though it\r\nis idle to distinguish political interests by their importance when\r\nboth are vital, yet we can admit that Johannesburg has for the moment\r\nmore obvious difficulties in her problems, and that her answer will be\r\nmore stormily contested. So far her development has been continuous.\r\nThe difficulties which she met with from the Kruger _regime_ were a\r\nblessing in disguise, being of the kind to put her on her mettle. But\r\nthe present stage in her history is more critical. Formerly the\r\nquestion was whether she was to remain a foreign cesspool or rise to\r\nthe status of an English city. Now it is whether she will go the way\r\nof many colonial cities, and become vigorous, dogmatic, proud,\r\nremotely English in sentiment, consistently material in her outlook,\r\nand narrow with the intense narrowness of those to whom politics mean\r\nlocal interests spiced with rhetoric; or, as she is already richer,\r\nmore enlightened, and more famous than her older sisters, will advance\r\non a higher plane, and become in the true sense an imperial city, with\r\na closer kinship and a more liberal culture. The question is a subtle\r\nand delicate one, as all questions of spiritual development must be. A\r\nyear ago much depended on the attitude of England. Johannesburg had\r\nsuffered heavily in the war. Time and patience were needed to repair\r\nthe breaches in her fortunes, and to permit her to advance, as she\r\nmust advance, if the Transvaal is to become a nation. She was rightly\r\njealous of her reputation and future prosperity. If taxation was to be\r\ncrudely imposed, if her just complaints were to be met with the old\r\nnonsense about a capitalists' war, if she was to be penalised for her\r\nmost creditable industry, then there was a good prospect of a serious\r\nestrangement. There was no issue on the facts. She never denied her\r\nliability, and she was willing to pay cheerfully if a little common\r\ntact were shown in the handling. A man who may have his hand in his\r\npocket to repay a debt will withdraw it if his creditor tries to\r\ncollect the money with a bludgeon. Happily the crisis has passed. A\r\nscheme of war contribution was arranged which, while still bearing\r\nheavily, almost too heavily, on the country in its present transition\r\nstage, is yet a small sum if contrasted with the lowest estimate of\r\nher assets. But much still depends on the attitude of England. A\r\nlittle sympathy, a little friendliness, a modest diminution of\r\nnewspaper taunts, some indication that the home country sees and\r\nappreciates the difficulties of its daughter, and is content to trust\r\nher judgment: it is not much to ask, but its refusal will never be\r\nforgotten or forgiven. For Johannesburg in this connection represents\r\nthe country on its most sensitive side, and acts as a barometer of\r\nnational feeling.\r\n\r\nIn this imperfect world there can be no development without attendant\r\ndisorders. A dead body is never troublesome, but a growing child is\r\nprone to exasperate. A young city which is perfectly reasonable and\r\ndocile deserves to be regarded with deep mistrust, for it is likely to\r\ncontinue in a kind of youthful sensibility till it disappears.\r\nFerment is a sign of life, and the very crudeness of the ideals which\r\ncause the ferment is a hopeful proof of vigour. Municipalities since\r\nthe beginning of time have been the home of aspirations after\r\nself-government, however ill-suited they may have been to rule\r\nthemselves. At this moment the Transvaal is a Crown colony, which is\r\nto say that a mode of government devised for subject races is being\r\napplied for a time to a free and restless British population. The\r\njustification is complete, but we need not be shocked when we find\r\nJohannesburg chafing at her fetters. The less so when we reflect that\r\nin one aspect she is a colonial city, full of the exaggerated\r\nindependence of the self-made. The fastidiousness which comes from\r\nculture and tradition, the humour which springs from unshaken\r\nconfidence, must necessarily be absent in a municipality which is\r\nstill diffident, still largely uneducated. Politics must begin with\r\nthe _schwaermerisch_ and the vapid,--\"that vague barren pathos, that\r\nuseless effervescence of enthusiasm, which plunges with the spirit of\r\na martyr into an ocean of generalities.\" Embryo cities are drunk with\r\nwords, with half-formed aspirations and vague ideals; wherefore the\r\nresult must be sound and fury and little meaning till by painful stages\r\nthey find themselves and see things as they are. So far this unrest has\r\ntaken two forms--a continuous and somewhat unintelligent criticism of\r\nthe Administration, and an attempt by means of numerous associations to\r\ngive voice to popular demands in the absence of representative\r\ninstitutions; and the beginnings of a labour party. The first is as\r\nnatural as day and night. Many grave matters, chiefly financial, are\r\nbeing decided above Johannesburg's head, and it is reasonable that she\r\nshould wish to state her own case. This is her strong point: the\r\nweakness of her position is that it is also a criticism of a\r\nreconstruction which is still in process, still in that stage when the\r\nfacts are far more clearly perceived by the man on the watch-tower than\r\nby the crowd in the streets below. A pawn in a game is not the best\r\nauthority on the moves which lead to success. Patience may be a\r\ndistasteful counsel, but why should she disquiet herself when all\r\nthings in the end must be in her hands? \"The people,\" to paraphrase a\r\nsaying of Heine, \"have time enough, they are immortal; administrators\r\nonly must pass away.\" But we cannot complain of this critical activity,\r\nhowever misplaced. It is a sign of life, and is itself the beginnings\r\nof political education. The second form of agitation is less reasonable\r\nand more dangerous, though perhaps less dangerous here than anywhere\r\nelse in the world. There must exist on the Rand, in mines, railways,\r\nand subsidiary industries, a large white industrial population; and the\r\nimported agitator will endeavour to organise it in accordance with his\r\ninterests. There is little theoretical justification for the movement.\r\nThere are no castes and tyrannies to fight against in a country which\r\nis so new and self-created. The great financial houses will not develop\r\ninto Trusts on the American model; and even if they did, the result\r\nwould have small effect on the working man, either as labourer or\r\nconsumer. There are dozens of false pretexts. The working man of the\r\nRand may try, as he has tried in Australia, to stereotype his monopoly\r\nand prevent the influx of new labour; or he may use the necessary\r\ndiscomforts of a transition stage as a lever to raise his wages; or the\r\nidle and incompetent may grumble vaguely against a capitalism which has\r\nbeen built up by their abler brothers. The pretexts are light as air.\r\nHe lives in a free society, and within limits can secure his comfort\r\nand independence beyond a chance of encroachment. But unhappily it does\r\nnot require a justification in reason to bring the labour agitator into\r\nbeing. That type, so well known in Australia, has already appeared, the\r\nunreasoning obstructionist, who, armed with a few platitudes and an\r\nentire absence of foresight, preaches his crude gospel to a class which\r\nis already vaguely unsettled by the intricacies of the economic\r\nproblem. There is almost certain to be an attempt to organise labour on\r\nAustralian lines, and to create a party like the Sand Lot agitators in\r\nSan Francisco, in order to do violence to the true economic interests\r\nof the land on behalf of a prejudice or a theory. Yet I cannot think\r\nthat there is more in the prospect than a temporary inconvenience. No\r\nlabour party can be really formidable unless it is based on profound\r\ndiscontents and radical grievances; and the annoyances of the\r\nJohannesburg proletariat are, as compared with those of Europe, like\r\ncrumpled rose-leaves to thorns. There is too strong a force of social\r\npersistence in the city to suffer it ever to become the prey of a\r\nwell-organised gang of revolutionaries; and if such a force exists, the\r\nexperience of Victoria in its great railway strike of 1903 would seem\r\nto show that in the long-run no labour war can succeed which tends to a\r\nwholesale disorganisation of social and industrial life.\r\n\r\nBut if Johannesburg shows a certain unrest, she also reveals a\r\ncurious solidarity--the strength of narrowness and exclusion, which is\r\npartly natural and due to the struggle for self-conscious existence,\r\nand partly accidental and based on a profound disappointment. Her\r\ncitizens believed that the end of the war would begin a golden age of\r\nunprecedented prosperity. Money was to flow into her coffers, her\r\npopulation to grow by many thousands each year, and she herself was to\r\nstand out before an envious world as a type of virtue rewarded. She\r\nmiscalculated the future, and the facts left her aghast. Conservative\r\nestimates, a few years back, put the value of the gold output in 1902\r\nat between 20 and 30 millions: the actual figures during the first\r\nyear of peace show little over 10 millions--a reduction on the output\r\nof 1898. Hence the almost hysterical concentration of interest on the\r\none great industry. Men who in other matters are remarkable for their\r\nbreadth of view, are to be found declaring that everything must be\r\nmade subordinate to mining development,--not in the sense in which the\r\nsaying is true, that the prosperity of the country depends in the\r\nfirst instance on the mines, but in the quite indefensible sense that\r\nany consideration of other things, even when there is no conflict\r\nbetween them and the mining interest, is a misapplication of energy\r\nwhich should go to the greater problem. It is fair to argue against a\r\nprogramme of public works which might draw native labour from the\r\nmines, because, unless we cherish the goose, there will be no golden\r\neggs to pay for our programmes. But to condemn schemes of settlement\r\nwhich are no more a hindrance to the gold industry than to the\r\nplanetary system, is to show a nervous blindness to graver questions,\r\nwhich is the ugliest product of the present strain and confusion. This\r\ntrait, however, cannot be permanent; and we may look to see the gold\r\nindustry in time, when its own crisis is past, become that enlightened\r\nforce in politics which the ability of its leaders and the weight of\r\nits organisation entitle it to be. For the other form of narrowness,\r\nwhich consists in the limitation of citizenship, there is ample\r\njustification in present circumstances. A new city must begin by\r\ndrawing in her skirts and showing herself, perhaps unwarrantably,\r\njealous and sensitive. More especially a city which has hitherto been\r\nrather a fortuitous gathering of races than a compact community, is\r\nright in straining after such compactness, even at the cost of a\r\nlittle injustice. The only danger lies in the perpetuation of this\r\nattitude when its justification has gone.\r\n\r\nThe fault of Johannesburg, to sum up, lies for the moment in a\r\ncertain narrow hardness of view: her hope is in the possession of\r\nrich elements unknown in most new cities; while her greatest danger\r\nlies in the fact that she cannot yet honestly claim those elements as\r\nher own. She is apt to judge a question from a lower point of view\r\nthan the question demands--to take up a parochial standpoint in\r\nmunicipal affairs, a municipal standpoint in national affairs, a\r\nnational standpoint in imperial questions. In spite of her many\r\nsplendid loyalties, she will find it hard to avoid the assertive\r\n_contra mundum_ attitude which seems inseparable from flourishing\r\ncolonial cities--a dogmatism natural, but unfortunate. On the other\r\nhand, her history and her present status give her a chance beyond\r\nother new cities. She starts on her civic career already rich,\r\nenterprising, the magnet for the first scientific talent of the world.\r\nA fortunate development might give her a cultivated class, true\r\npolitical instincts, and the self-restraint which springs from a high\r\ncivilisation, without at the same time impairing that energy which she\r\nowes to her colonial parentage. The danger is that her ablest element\r\nmay continue alien, treating the city as a caravanserai, and returning\r\nto Europe as soon as its ambition is satisfied. So far the intellect\r\nhas not been with the men who have made the place their home, but,\r\nsubject to a few remarkable exceptions, with the men who have never\r\nconcealed their impatience to get away. If she fails to make this\r\nclass her citizens, then, whatever her prosperity, as a city she will\r\nremain mediocre. Nothing can deprive her of her position as the\r\nforemost market; but if she is to be also the real capital of South\r\nAfrica, she must absorb the men who are now her resident aliens. There\r\nare signs, indeed, that the process has begun in all seriousness. As\r\nshe becomes a more pleasant dwelling-place, many who find in the\r\nfuture of the country the main interest of their lives will find in\r\nJohannesburg the best field of labour for the end they desire. And the\r\ngrowth of such a leisured class, who take part in public life for its\r\nown sake and for no commercial interests, will not only import into\r\nmunicipal politics a broader view and a healthier spirit, but will do\r\nmuch to secure that community of interest between town and country by\r\nwhich alone a united South Africa can be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitutional requirements of a country are never determined\r\nsolely by its political needs. Some account must be taken of its prior\r\nhistory, for theories of government are apt to sink deep into the mind\r\nof a people and to become unconsciously a part of its political\r\noutlook. No form of education is less conscious or more abiding in its\r\neffects. It may even happen that the fabric which such theories\r\ncreated has been deliberately overthrown with the popular consent, but\r\nnone the less the theories are still there in some form or other to\r\nobtrude themselves in future experiments. It is always worth while,\r\ntherefore, in any reconstruction to look at the ideas of government\r\nwhich held sway before, whether in the shape of a professed creed or\r\nin the practical form of institutions. The constitutional history of\r\nSouth Africa is not long, and it is not complex. In Natal and Cape\r\nColony we possess two specimens of ordinary self-governing colonies.\r\nNatal, which began life as a Crown colony, subject to the Governor of\r\nthe Cape, was granted substantive independence by charter in 1856, and\r\nin 1893 was given representative government. It possesses a nominated\r\nlegislative council of nine members, and an elective legislative\r\nassembly of thirty-nine members, elected on an easy franchise. Cape\r\nColony also began as a Crown colony, and followed nearly the same\r\npath. Her legislative council was created in 1850, and by an\r\nordinance of this legislature in 1872, ratified by an Act of the\r\nImperial Parliament, she obtained full representative institutions.\r\nHer council and her house of assembly are each elected and on the same\r\nfranchise. In these two colonies we have, therefore, types of\r\ncolonial autonomy--that is to say, an unfettered executive and\r\nfreedom to legislate subject to the consent of the Governor and the\r\nCrown in Council, a limitation which is daily becoming more of a\r\npious fiction. In Southern Rhodesia we have a specimen of that very\r\nmodern experiment, government by a commercial company. It is a\r\nprovisional form, and has been made to approximate as far as is\r\nreasonably possible to a Crown colony. The executive power is in the\r\nhands of the company's officials, subject to an indirect control by\r\nthe Imperial Resident Commissioner, the High Commissioner, and\r\nultimately by the Crown. There is a legislative council, partly\r\nnominated by the company and partly elected, and all legislation is\r\ncontingent upon the sanction of the imperial authorities. Lastly,\r\nthere are the native states, the Crown colony of Basutoland, and the\r\nprotectorates of Bechuanaland, North-West Rhodesia, and Swaziland,\r\nall of which are directly or indirectly under the authority of the\r\nHigh Commissioner. So far there is no constitutional novelty--Crown\r\ncolonies advancing to an ordinary type of self-government, or\r\nremaining, provisionally or permanently, under full imperial control.\r\n\r\nThere remain the late Governments of the Republics, which to the student\r\nof constitutional forms show certain interesting peculiarities.[30]\r\nThese constitutions were framed by men who had no tradition[31] to\r\nfall back upon, if we exclude the Mosaic law, and no theories to give\r\neffect to--men who would have preferred to do without government, had\r\nit been possible, but who, once the need became apparent, brought to\r\nthe work much shrewdness and good sense. The Natal emigrants in 1838\r\nhad established a Volksraad, but the chief feature in their scheme was\r\nthe submission of all important matters to a primary public assembly, a\r\nHomeric gathering of warriors. By the time the Sand River and\r\nBloemfontein Conventions were signed and the two republics became\r\nindependent, the people were scattered over a wide expanse of country,\r\nand some form of representation was inevitable. At the same time, it\r\nhad become necessary to provide for a military organisation coextensive\r\nwith the civil. In the Transvaal transient republics had arisen and\r\ndeparted, like the changes in a kaleidoscope. Around both states there\r\nwas a native population, actively hostile and potentially dangerous.\r\nSome central military and civil authority was needed to keep the\r\ncountry from anarchy. But if the farmers were without political\r\ntheories, they had a very vigorous sense of personal independence; so\r\nthe doctrinal basis of the new constitution lay in the axiom that one\r\nburgher in the State is as good as another, and that the people are the\r\nfinal repository of power. In this at least they were democratic,\r\nthough from other traits of democracy they have ever held aloof.\r\n\r\nThe _Constitutie_ of the Orange Free State was rigid--that is, it\r\ncould be altered only by methods different from those of ordinary\r\nlegislation: in the Transvaal _Grondwet_, on the other hand, there\r\nwas no provision for change at all, and reforms, when necessary, were\r\nmade in the ordinary legislative manner. The _Constitutie_ created one\r\nsupreme legislature, the Volksraad, elected by the qualified white\r\npopulation. The President was elected by the whole people, though the\r\nVolksraad, like the Roman consuls, reserved the power to make\r\nnominations, which were generally accepted. The Volksraad had not only\r\nsupreme legislative power, but, while formally independent of the\r\nPresident and the executive, it could reverse any executive Act,\r\nexcept the exercise of the President's right of pardon and the\r\ndeclaration of martial law. It was limited only by its own charter,\r\nwhich forbade it to restrict the right of public meeting and petition\r\n(one of the few Bill of Rights elements in this constitution), and\r\nbound it to promote and support the Dutch Reformed Church. The\r\nTransvaal _Grondwet_ began by making the Dutch Reformed Church an\r\nestablished national Church (a provision repealed later), and\r\ndeclaring that \"the people will not tolerate any equality between\r\ncoloured and white inhabitants in Church or State.\" No man was\r\neligible for a seat in the Volksraad unless he was a member of a\r\nProtestant Church.[32] In the Transvaal, as in the Orange Free State,\r\nthe Volksraad was the supreme legislative authority, but when any law\r\nwas proposed the people were given the opportunity of expressing their\r\nopinion in a mild form of the referendum. The President was elected by\r\nthe whole people and acted as chief of the executive, though\r\nresponsible to the Volksraad, which could dismiss him or cancel his\r\nappointments. He could sit and speak in the Volksraad, but had no\r\nvote. The chief military authority was the Commandant General, who was\r\nelected by all the burghers, and under him there was a long hierarchy\r\nof district commandants and field-cornets. The local administrative\r\nofficer for civil matters was the landdrost or district magistrate. It\r\nis unnecessary to consider the Second Volksraad, which was an\r\nineffective advisory body elected on a wider franchise, a mere sop to\r\nthe Cerberus whose hundred tongues were clamouring for representation.\r\nBut there was one curious development of considerable historic\r\ninterest. In cases of urgency the Volksraad could pass laws without\r\nreference to the people at large, but such an enactment was called a\r\nresolution (_besluit_) as contrasted with a law (_wet_), and was\r\nsupposed to have only a provisional force. But the habit grew of\r\ncalling most matters \"specially urgent,\" and allowing the old popular\r\nreferendum to fall into desuetude.\r\n\r\nThe common feature of both constitutions was the immense nominal powers\r\nof the legislatures. Nominally they had the right to make all\r\nappointments, to veto the President's action, and to say the last word\r\nin all questions of revenue and expenditure. But certain facts wrought\r\nagainst this legislative supremacy. The members came from districts\r\nwidely apart, and there was no serious attempt to form groups or\r\nparties; the President could sit and speak in the Volksraad, and he\r\nmight be elected as often as he could persuade the people to elect him.\r\nThe way was paved for the tyranny of a strong man. In the Orange Free\r\nState, that country of mild prosperity and simple problems, the system\r\nworked admirably; but in the Transvaal, when burning questions arose,\r\nthe republican methods for all serious purposes broke down, and were\r\nreplaced by a dictatorship. There remain, however, certain doctrines\r\nfrom the old _regime_ which will have to be reckoned with under the\r\nnew. The supremacy of the legislature is not one, for no Boer cared\r\nmuch for the dogma, and Mr Kruger ruled on the simple maxim, \"L'etat\r\nc'est moi.\" But the democratic principle of equality among citizens is\r\none cherished belief, and another is the absolute disqualification of\r\nall coloured races.[33] The Boer is not a parliamentarian in the\r\nordinary sense, and he did not grieve when his Volksraad was slighted\r\nand made impotent; but he likes his representative to go to Pretoria,\r\nas a sort of tribute to his importance, and, if he is to vote, he\r\ndemands to vote on an equal basis with all. He was attached to his\r\nlocal administration with its landdrost system, and any change which\r\nbore no relation to the old plan might begin by confusing and end by\r\nsouring him.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore to face two existing constitutional traditions--among\r\nthe British from the Cape or Natal or over-seas, the old love of\r\ncolonial self-government; among the Boers, at least in the Transvaal, a\r\nkind of ingenuous republican independence, quite consistent with a\r\npatient tolerance of absolutism, but not so easy to adapt to the\r\ngradations of our representative system. Hence in many ways the Boer is\r\nfar more likely to remain patient for years under a Crown colony\r\nGovernment than the English or colonial new-comer. He does not\r\nparticularly want to vote or interfere in administration, so long as\r\nhe has no personal grievance; but it might annoy him to see the\r\nfranchise denied to him and given to his cousin who was a little richer\r\nor better educated, when he remembered the old _Grondwet_ doctrines of\r\nequality, and it would certainly exasperate him to learn that any\r\nnative had been granted a civic status beyond him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch being the constitutional history, we may turn to the present. The\r\nterm Crown colony is used so loosely that very few of its many critics\r\ncould define the peculiar features of this form of government. \"One of\r\nthe greatest of all evils,\" wrote Lord Durham in the famous Report\r\nwhich has become the charter of colonial policy, \"arising from this\r\nsystem of irresponsible government, was the mystery in which the\r\nmotives and actual purposes of their rulers were hid from the\r\ncolonists themselves. The most important business of government was\r\ncarried on, not in open discussions or public acts, but in a secret\r\ncorrespondence between the Governor and the Secretary of State.\" This\r\nfeature, more than any other, tends to dissatisfaction. The Crown\r\ncolony system is necessarily a secret one. The newspapers, till\r\nblue-books are issued, are informed only as much or as little as the\r\nauthorities may think good for them; and the natural critics of all\r\nadministration have the somewhat barren pleasure of finding fault with\r\na policy after it has become a fact. There is no safety-valve for the\r\nescape of grievances, no official channel even for sound local advice.\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, therefore, if it seems an intolerable\r\nburden to men full of anxiety about the methods by which they are\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nThe Crown colony system is not new to Africa. It existed for years in\r\nthe Cape and Natal; it still exists in its most rigid form over\r\nnative states, and at its worst it does not spurn public opinion in\r\nthe fashion of the Kruger _regime_--it simply neglects it. The name is\r\nreally a misnomer, for it is no part of the English colonial system.\r\nThe American Revolution is sometimes described as the revolt of an\r\nEnglish people from Crown colony government, but in those days the\r\nthing was not in existence. It is fundamentally the method invented to\r\ngovern a race which is incapable of free representative institutions,\r\nor to tide over a temporary difficulty. The Governor is absolute,\r\nsubject to the conditions of his appointment and the instructions\r\naccompanying his letters-patent. He may be assisted by a council, but\r\nit is his privilege, on reasons shown, to override his council. He is\r\nthe sole local fountain of executive and legislative power. But if he\r\nis absolute in one sense, he is strictly tied in another. The methods\r\nof his administration are subject to certain regulations issued by the\r\nColonial Office. The Secretary of State must approve his appointments,\r\nand all important administrative acts, as well as all legislation.\r\nFurther, in serious questions the Home Government exercises a general\r\noversight of policy before the event, and the Governor in such\r\nmatters is merely the mouthpiece of the Cabinet. It is in itself a\r\nrational system, and works well under certain conditions. In a\r\nserious crisis, when large imperial issues are involved, and when\r\nlocal policy is but a branch of a wider policy, it is highly\r\nimportant that this day-to-day supervision should exist; and in a\r\ncase where speed is essential, Crown colony methods, though slow\r\nenough in all conscience, are rapidity itself compared with the\r\ncumbrous machinery of representative government.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of treating the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony\r\ntemporarily as Crown colonies was beyond argument. Reconstruction began\r\nin the midst of war, when the material of self-government was wanting.\r\nIt goes on amidst unsettled and dimly understood conditions, where\r\ncertain facts of policy stand out in a strong light and all else is\r\nshadow. It involves many financial transactions in which the Home\r\nGovernment is deeply interested; and it is natural that a close\r\nadministrative connection should be thought desirable. It comes at the\r\nend of a costly war, and it is right that England should have a direct\r\nsay in securing herself against its repetition. The racial problem is\r\nstill too delicate to submit to the arbitrament of popular bodies; and\r\nif it were settled out of hand there might remain an abiding cause of\r\ndiscontent. The time is not ripe for self-government, the country has\r\nnot yet found herself, having but barely awakened from the torpor of\r\nwar and begun to set her house in order. Again, there are factors to be\r\nborne in mind in re-creating the new colonies which extend far beyond\r\ntheir borders. It is impossible to imagine that due consideration could\r\nbe given to them by the ablest elective body in the world, called\r\ntogether in the present ferment. Above all, what is to be done must be\r\ndone quickly. The wants of the hour are too urgent for delays. There\r\nmust be some authority, trusted by the British Cabinet, capable of\r\ndetermining the needs of the situation, and giving summary effect to\r\nhis decision.\r\n\r\nOn this all thinking men in the new colonies are agreed. I do not\r\nsuppose that any of the more serious critics of the expedient would\r\nbe prepared to propose and defend an alternative. But irritation\r\nremains when reason has done its best, and it is not hard to see the\r\ncauses. One is the natural disinclination of Englishmen to be ruled\r\nfrom above, a repulsion which they feel even when arguing in its\r\nfavour. Another is the secrecy of Crown colony government, to which I\r\nhave already referred. It is painful to find matters of vital\r\nimportance to yourself decided without your knowledge, even when you\r\nhave the fullest confidence in the deciding power. There is also,\r\nperhaps, a little distrust still left in South Africa of the British\r\nGovernment,--not of particular Ministers, but of the vague entity\r\nbehind them--a distrust which has had in the past such ample\r\njustification that it is hard to blame it. The colonial mind, too, is\r\naverse to English officialdom, even when represented by the several\r\nhighly competent men who have shared in the present administration.\r\nRed-tape, which in its place is most necessary and desirable, seems to\r\nlurk in the offices of men who are in reality trying hard to deal with\r\nfacts in the simplest way. A certain amount of formal officialdom is\r\nnecessary in all government. There must be people to keep an office in\r\norder, to make a fetich of etiquette, to insist on a stereotyped\r\nprocedure, and to see the world dimly through a mist of \"previous\r\npapers.\" It is a useful, but not very valuable, type of man, and we\r\ncannot wonder that a South African, who imagines that such a one has,\r\nwhat he rarely has, an influence in grave decisions, should view with\r\ndistrust the form of government which permits him. It is a mistake,\r\nbut one based on an honest instinct.\r\n\r\nSelf-government is the goal to which all things hasten, and critics of\r\nthe present administration check their complaints at the thought of\r\nthat beneficent day. Meanwhile it is our business to set things in\r\norder so that the chosen of the people, when they enter into their\r\ninheritance, may find it swept and garnished. Representative\r\ninstitutions should not spring full grown from an Order in Council,\r\nlike Athene from the brain of Zeus: if they do, there is apt to be a\r\npainful crudeness about their early history. The way should be\r\nprepared by gentle means, for, after all, it is a country in which the\r\nbulk of the residents have had no experience of governing themselves.\r\nThe experiment has so far been tried in two ways. The municipalities\r\nrepresent the highest level of intelligence and political training; in\r\nmunicipal affairs, therefore, it is safe to begin at once with\r\nrepresentation. The first town councils were for all practical\r\npurposes Government departments, nominated by Government and assisted\r\non their difficult career by Government supervision. But a nominated\r\ntown council is an anomaly even within a Crown colony, since a town\r\ncouncil is not concerned with high politics but only with the\r\nadministration of the area in which its citizens choose to dwell, and\r\nany owner of property has a right to a voice in determining the ways\r\nin which his property shall be safeguarded. The basis of any municipal\r\nfranchise is the payment of rates, which imply the ownership of\r\nproperty; and questions of race, loyalty, even of education, have no\r\nlogical place in what is simply a practical union for the protection\r\nof proprietary interests and the care of the amenities of civilised\r\nlife. The question of elective municipalities is therefore a simple\r\none, and as soon as a municipal law could be put together, the system\r\nwas inaugurated. This is not the place to examine the type of\r\nmunicipal franchise adopted in the Transvaal, which is a skilful\r\ncompendium of various colonial precedents. But on one matter, the\r\ncoloured and alien vote, there was manifested a vigorous tendency to\r\nconservatism and exclusion. As I have said, this is a province where\r\nracial distinctions have no logical place. If a black man is a\r\nratepayer he has the citizen's right to vote. Nor can we on purely\r\nrational grounds confine this franchise to British subjects. But the\r\ncountry thought differently. As the municipal was her only form of\r\nrepresentation, political considerations crept in unawares, and the\r\nresult, while logically indefensible, has a certain practical\r\njustification. For in a time of reconstruction a community is apt\r\nrather to narrow than enlarge its boundaries, feeling above all things\r\nthe need of a compact front against the unknown. In time, no doubt,\r\nthe true theory of municipal franchise will reassert itself, and if,\r\nwhen the time comes, a constructive policy towards the subject races\r\nhas also come into being, the delay will have been not in vain.\r\n\r\nA more important step towards self-government was the creation of\r\nnominated legislative councils for both colonies, which held their\r\nfirst meetings in the early part of 1903. In the Transvaal there were\r\nsixteen official members representing the different Government\r\ndepartments, and fourteen non-official members selected from\r\nrepresentative Englishmen and Boers in the country. In the Orange\r\nRiver Colony there were six official members and four non-official.\r\nSome of the new measures which concerned more deeply the people of the\r\ncolonies were kept back on purpose for the opinion of the new\r\ncouncils. Such were the new gold and diamond laws, the municipal\r\nfranchise law, and the ordinances governing the disposal of town\r\nlands. So far the expedient has promised well; an outlet has been\r\ncreated for public opinion, though for the present such opinion cannot\r\ncarry with it practical force; and the procedure of Government has\r\nceased to be a state secret, and is patent to any one who has the\r\ncuriosity or the patience to attend the council's debates. It is\r\ninteresting to observe how the unofficial members already appear in a\r\nquasi-representative capacity, and are beginning to attach themselves\r\nto particular districts, for which, so far as airing grievances and\r\nobtaining information go, they perform most of the duties of an\r\nelected member. There is no reason why such members should not be\r\nelected instead of nominated, and in this way provide a trial for the\r\nform of franchise on which autonomy is to be based. There are many\r\nobvious difficulties in any franchise for the new colonies, and it\r\nwould be well for such difficulties to be realised and faced while the\r\nwhole matter is still mainly academic, and errors are not yet attended\r\nwith practical disaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe franchise for the new colonies is the constitutional problem which\r\nis of the most immediate importance. It will not be wise to delay the\r\nera of self-government long, for between the most elastic Crown colony\r\nand the narrowest free colony there is an inseparable gulf, and though\r\nit may be said justly that with an elective legislature the colonies\r\nhave something very like freedom, the one thing needful will still be\r\nlacking. It is not enough to put the oars into their hands; we must\r\ncut the painter before they are truly free. There is one postulate in\r\nall franchise discussions which is likely to be vigorously attacked.\r\nThe franchise must be based in the first instance upon the principle\r\nof giving adequate representation to all districts and every interest;\r\nbut, once this has been recognised, the second principle appears--of\r\nproviding for the supremacy of the British population. That saying of\r\nDogberry's, \"An two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind,\" is a\r\nprimary law not only of equitation but of politics in the treatment of\r\na conquered country. For conquered it is, and there is little use\r\ndisguising it: we have not been fighting for the love of it or for\r\nfine sentiment, but to conquer the land and give our people the\r\nmastery. The last word in all matters must rest with us--that is, with\r\nthe people of British blood and British sympathies. Both men must be\r\non the horse, or, apart from parable, each race must have fair and\r\nample representation. To deny this would be to sin against sound\r\npolicy. But not to take measures to see that our own race has the\r\ncasting vote is to be guilty of the commonest folly. \"An two men ride\r\nof a horse, one must ride behind.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever denies this principle may spare himself the trouble of reading\r\nfurther, for it is proposed to treat it as axiomatic. The first type\r\nof franchise need not be permanent: a day may come when it will be\r\nneedless to consider the distinction of Dutch and British. But as it\r\nwas right and politic on the conclusion of war to disarm our\r\nopponents, so it is right and politic in the first franchise to put no\r\nweapon of offence into their hands. The primary adjustment of the\r\nfranchise and the primary distribution of seats must be made with this\r\nclear end in view--to secure a working majority for the British people.\r\nIt is obvious that the words \"British population\" are vague, and\r\ninclude many odd forms of nationality, but the thing itself is simple,\r\nthe class whose interests and sentiment are on the British side, who\r\nseek progress on British lines. It does not follow that the majority\r\nof the Dutch will go into opposition, but it is ordinary prudence to\r\nkeep on the safe side. Such a policy involves no distrust of the Dutch\r\npopulation, but is the common duty of those who for a certain period\r\nmust, as conquerors, take the initiative in administration, and, as\r\nbearing the responsibility, preserve an adequate means of control.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the franchise are a more difficult matter. In Cape Colony\r\ncitizenship and a low property qualification are the chief conditions.\r\nIn Southern Rhodesia, whose franchise law is an especially clear and\r\nsensible code, an oath of loyalty is accepted in lieu of technical\r\ncitizenship, and an easy educational test is demanded--the ability of\r\na voter to sign his name and write his address and occupation. In\r\nNatal there is a sharp distinction drawn between Europeans and all\r\nothers. To them the only tests are citizenship, and the ownership or\r\noccupation of property of a certain value, or the receipt of a certain\r\namount of income. The native is practically disqualified by a law\r\ndenying the franchise to any person subject to special courts or\r\nspecial laws, and though a means of escape is provided, the conditions\r\nare too complex even for more intelligent minds than the native. It is\r\nan ingenious but not wholly satisfactory device. Asiatics are excluded\r\nby the law which denies votes to natives, or descendants in the male\r\nline of natives, of any country which does not enjoy the blessings of\r\nrepresentative government; and though in their case also there is a\r\nway of escape, it is almost equally difficult. The root distinction\r\nbetween types of franchise lies in the method employed to exclude an\r\nundesirable class, whether a direct one, by disqualifying in so many\r\nwords, or an indirect, by setting one standard of qualification for\r\nall, to which, as a matter of fact, the undesirable class cannot\r\nattain. The balance of argument is, on the whole, on the side of the\r\nsecond method, which has been adopted in Cape Colony and Rhodesia,\r\nthough, perhaps, with too low a standard. But the first method, if\r\nfollowed more frankly than in Natal, has something to be said for it.\r\nThere is no reason why the better class of Indians should not vote, if\r\ntheir race is considered fit to mix on equal terms with English\r\nsociety elsewhere; but to my mind there is a very good reason why the\r\nnative should not vote--at least, not for the present. The easy way of\r\nsecuring this result is the old method of the Transvaal _Grondwet_,\r\nwhich said shortly, \"There shall be no equality between black and\r\nwhite.\" It is the way, too, which, under the Conditions of Surrender,\r\nwould have to be adopted in any trial franchise put into force before\r\nself-government. I am not sure whether it is not the most philosophic\r\nas well as the simplest way, for it denies the native the franchise\r\nnot for a lack of property or educational qualification, but for\r\nradical mental dissimilarity. In any case it is a matter which must be\r\nleft for the people of the colony to settle for themselves. But for\r\nall others, while the property basis of the franchise should be low,\r\nthere are grounds for thinking that a reasonably high educational test\r\nshould be added. The lower type of European and the back-veld Dutchman\r\nhave in their present state no equitable right to the decision, which\r\nthe franchise gives, on matters which they are unable to come within a\r\nmeasurable distance of understanding. The fact that the fool may have\r\na vote at home is no reason for exalting him to the same level in a\r\ncountry which is not handicapped by a constitutional history. Some\r\nform of British citizenship, obtainable by a short and simple method,\r\nmust also be demanded if the land is to remain a British colony.\r\n\r\nOnce the franchise has been determined there remains the division of\r\nconstituencies. The axiom has already been explained which appears to\r\ngovern this question. But in the absence of anything approaching\r\ncorrect census returns it is difficult to suggest, even tentatively, a\r\ndistribution of seats. The fairest way to secure the representation of\r\nall interests seems to be to divide constituencies into three types.\r\nFirst, there are the large towns, which for the present, to take the\r\nTransvaal, may be limited to Johannesburg and Pretoria. These would be\r\ngiven members according to their population. Second, come groups of\r\ncountry burghs, such groups as the Northern Burghs, with Nylstroom,\r\nWarm Baths, Piet Potgieter's Rust, and Pietersburg; and the Eastern\r\nBurghs, with Middelburg and Belfast, Lydenburg and Barberton. Here,\r\ntoo, members would be allotted according to population, though the\r\nnumber of voters required to form a constituency should be fewer.\r\nLastly, there would be the country districts, substantially the present\r\nfourteen magisterial divisions, and there the numbers of a constituency\r\nwould be still smaller. That it is fair to differentiate in favour of\r\nthe counties against the burghs, and in favour of the burghs against\r\nthe large towns, will appear on a brief consideration. The interests of\r\nthe different constituencies in a city, at least in a new city, are\r\npractically identical. In the country burghs the interests vary, but\r\nstill within narrow limits. In the counties, on the other hand, there\r\nis often a very wide variation. The dwellers in Barberton have wholly\r\ndifferent problems and grievances from the dwellers in Bloemhof or\r\nStanderton. But while this principle is right, the former axiom must be\r\nkept in mind, that, provided fair representation is granted to all, the\r\nconstituencies must be so arranged as to ensure British predominance.\r\nCertain counties will, I believe, be on the whole British in\r\ntime--Bloemhof, Marico, Zoutpansberg, possibly Waterberg, possibly\r\nLydenburg, undoubtedly Barberton. The burghs, too, will yield on the\r\nwhole a British voting population. In all likelihood, therefore, our\r\npurpose will be secured by the division of constituencies which I have\r\nsuggested, even allowing for a differentiation in favour of the rural\r\ndistricts. Figures are still impossible in the absence of a census, but\r\non the roughest estimate there may be in the Transvaal at the present\r\nmoment a Boer population of 100,000, with a voting proportion of\r\n30,000, and a British population of perhaps 150,000, with a voting\r\nproportion of 50,000 or upwards. In the Orange River Colony before the\r\nwar the voters' roll showed just over 17,000, and if we put the vote on\r\nan enlarged franchise at 20,000, we may be near the mark. The position\r\nof the latter colony will not change greatly in the next decade, but\r\nthe Transvaal may easily in a few years show a million inhabitants and\r\nmore. With a population thus constantly increasing and liable to great\r\nlocal fluctuations, redistribution may soon become a vexed question and\r\na source of political chicanery. It would be well if the endless\r\nfriction which attends redistribution courts and commissions could be\r\nsaved by some automatic system under which sudden local inequalities\r\ncould be speedily and finally adjusted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe greatest constitutional calamity which could befall South Africa\r\nwould be for the Dutch in the new colonies to go as a race into\r\nopposition. I have said that they are not born parliamentarians, and\r\nthat, to begin with at least, they will be a little strange to the\r\nforms and methods of English representative government. But they are\r\na strong and serious people, and if they desire, as a race, to form\r\nan opposition, they will learn the tactics of a parliament as readily\r\nas their kinsmen have done in the Cape. It will be difficult to form\r\nout of so practical and stable a folk such an opposition as the\r\nNationalist party in Ireland; but if they have real grievances to\r\nfight for, it is conceivable that the Dutch people might be organised\r\ninto as solid a voting machine as the Irish peasantry under the\r\ncontrol of the Land League and the Church. Attempts will doubtless be\r\nmade to bring this about. Certain institutions will spare no pains to\r\nsecure so promising a recruit in their policy of emphasising every\r\nfeature in the South African situation which tends to disunion. On\r\nthe other hand, certain of the natural leaders of the Dutch people,\r\nwho have acquired the spurious race-hatred which intriguers and\r\nadventurers have built up during the past twenty years, in a\r\ndesperately discreet and orthodox manner may work to the same end.\r\nBut fortunately there are signs that the party division, when it\r\ncomes, will be lateral and not vertical. It is a phenomenon often\r\nobserved in a long war, that a day of apathy sets in, differences\r\narise in a party, and one section begins to dislike the other far\r\nmore than it hates the common enemy. This phenomenon, which in war\r\nspells disaster, is salutary enough in civil politics. In both races\r\nthere are signs of divisions, and on each side there is a party\r\nunconsciously drawing nearer to their old opponents. The majority of\r\nthe Dutch have little rancour, except against each other; to many\r\nthe Bond is as much an object of suspicion as, let us say, Mr\r\nChamberlain. The old nebulous Pan-Afrikander dreams were in no way\r\npopular with the Transvaal Boer, who would have been nearly as much\r\nannoyed at being harassed with an Afrikander federation as at being\r\nannexed to Natal. Besides, he is not a good party man, being too\r\nsincere an individualist. Intrigue of the carpet-bag and secret-league\r\nvariety he will never shine in, and he does not desire to, though apt\r\nenough at a kind of rustic diplomacy. There is, further, a party ready\r\nmade for him. He is frankly anti-Johannesburg, a pure agrarian.\r\nAlready the anomalous labour party of the Rand are making overtures to\r\nhim, and with loud declamations on his merits strive to attract his\r\nsympathies. On certain matters he may join them, but it will be an odd\r\nunion, and not a long one. Town and country will never long remain in\r\nconjunction, and there are few items, indeed, of a labour programme to\r\nwhich he would subscribe.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to draw with any confidence the political horoscope of\r\nthe new colonies. Certain eternal antitheses will exist,--Capital and\r\nLabour, Rand and Veld, Progress and the staunchest of staunch\r\nConservatisms,--but none of them seem likely to coalesce so as to form\r\nany permanent division of parties. It is as easy to imagine Rand\r\ncapitalists and country Dutch united on certain questions as Boer and\r\nLabour. Possibly the old distinction of Liberal and Tory in some form\r\nor other will appear in the end. It is said that the colonies are\r\naggressively Liberal; but these are different from other colonies, and\r\nthe groundwork of Conservatism already exists. We have a plutocracy\r\nand a landed aristocracy. We have also in the legal element a class,\r\nin its South African form, peculiarly tenacious of the letter of the\r\nlaw. We have an established kirk in all but name, and a racial\r\ntradition of resistance to novelty. With the growth of a rich and\r\nleisured population, and of social grades and conventions, there will\r\ncome a time when politics may well be divided between those who are\r\nsatisfied with things as they are, and those who hunger for things as\r\nthey cannot be--with, of course, a sprinkling of plain men who do\r\ntheir work without theories. We shall have the doctrinaire idealist,\r\ndoubtless, to experiment on the labour and native questions; and in\r\nplace of having politics based on interests, we may have them based in\r\nname and reality on creeds and dogmas, which is what English\r\nconstitutionalism desires. All such developments are just and normal,\r\nand in any one the land may find political stability.\r\n\r\nThere is one contingency alone which must be regarded with the\r\ngreatest dread--the growth of a South African party, which is South\r\nAfrican because anti-British. The war raised colonial loyalty to a\r\nheight; but such loyalty is like a rocket, which may speedily expire\r\nin the void in a blaze of brightness, or may kindle a steady flame if\r\nthe material be there. We must remember that we have in the Dutch a\r\nlarge population to which the British tie means nothing; a large and\r\nimportant class, in the cosmopolitan financiers, who may be covertly\r\nhostile to British interests; and even in some of the most sterling\r\nand public-spirited citizens men who, if the Dutch Government had\r\nallowed them, would have surrendered their nationality and become\r\ncitizens of the republics. South African loyalty, splendid as it is,\r\nis rather fidelity to British traditions than to that overt link which\r\nconstitutes empire. You will, indeed, hear the true theory of colonial\r\npolicy well stated and strongly defended; but it must not be\r\nforgotten that in South Africa it is still somewhat of an exotic\r\nplant, and wants careful tending before it can come to maturity.\r\nUnadvised action on our part may nip the growth, and give a chance for\r\na party which might declare, to adopt the words of the old loyalists\r\nof Lower Canada, that it was determined to be South African even at\r\nthe cost of ceasing to be British. A too long or too straitly ordered\r\ntutelage might do it, or a harsh dictation on some local question of\r\nvital interest, or the continuance of the old calumnies about the\r\nRand, the old vulgar sneer at the colonial-born. It is well to\r\nremember that while the land is a Crown colony it is one only in name,\r\nand that all the tact and discretion which we use in dealing with\r\nself-governing colonies should be used in this case also.\r\n\r\nSuch a party may arise, but there is no reason in the nature of things\r\nfor its existence. South African and British are not opposites. As I\r\nunderstand the theory of colonial government, England stands towards\r\nher colonies as a parent who starts his sons in the world, wishing\r\nthem all prosperity; and though in after-years he may exercise the\r\nparental right of giving advice, he will not attempt to coerce the\r\naction of those who have come to years of maturity. The tie is\r\nstrongest when it is not of the letter but of the spirit. At the same\r\ntime it is well to preserve certain outward and visible signs of\r\ndescent,--well for the fatherland, better for the colonies, who draw\r\nfrom that fatherland their social and political traditions and their\r\nspiritual sustenance. At the moment South Africa is in a transition\r\nstage. Her public opinion is scarcely formed on any subject; she is\r\nfull of vague aspirations, uneasy yearnings, and half-fledged hopes.\r\nShe will develop either into the staunchest of allies in any imperial\r\nfederation, or the most recalcitrant and isolated of colonies. She has\r\nenough and to spare of good men who desire nothing more than that the\r\nAfrican nation, when it comes, should be a British people, and if she\r\nis trusted whole-heartedly, she will not betray the trust. She will\r\neven accept advice and reproof in proper cases, for, unless we drive\r\nher to ingratitude, she is not ungrateful for the blood and treasure\r\nwhich Britain has spent on her making. But she is like a young\r\nwell-bred colt, whose mouth may be easily spoiled by over-bitting, and\r\nwhose temper will be ruined by the bad hands or too hasty temper of\r\nits trainer.\r\n\r\nTwo important constitutional questions remain. One is the great policy\r\nof Federation, which looms as a background behind all sporadic\r\nconstitutional forms. The second concerns that part of the imperial\r\nforces which is to be stationed in South Africa--a matter which is not\r\nonly an army question but one deeply affecting colonial interests. To\r\nthese the two succeeding chapters are devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [30]  Mr Bryce, in his 'Studies in History and Jurisprudence,'\r\n        vol. i. pp. 430-467, has a valuable examination of the\r\n        old Transvaal and Orange River Colony constitutions.\r\n\r\n  [31]  Stray dogmas from the French Revolution had undoubtedly\r\n        some share in the ferment preceding the Great Trek, but\r\n        I cannot think that the voortrekkers carried any such\r\n        baggage with them to the wilderness.\r\n\r\n  [32]  The original _Grondwet_ declared that no Roman Catholic\r\n        Church, nor any Protestant Church which did not teach\r\n        the Heidelberg Catechism, should be admitted within the\r\n        Republic.\r\n\r\n  [33]  There was no reason _in law_ under the old Orange Free\r\n        State Government why a native should not have the\r\n        municipal franchise through ownership, and an Asiatic\r\n        through occupation of town property. But in practice--a\r\n        practice deduced from the spirit of the\r\n        _Constitutie_--no such voters were registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE POLICY OF FEDERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo South African problem is more long-descended than the question of\r\nFederation. It was a dream of Sir George Grey's in the mid-century,\r\nand it was a central feature in the policy of Sir Bartle Frere--that\r\npolicy which, after twenty years of obscuration, is at last seen in\r\nits true and beneficent light. Nor was it held only by English\r\ngovernors. Local statesmen in Cape Colony saw in it a panacea for the\r\nendless frontier difficulties which tried their patience and their\r\ntalents. The ultra-independent colonist, in whose ears \"Africa for the\r\nAfrikanders\" was beginning to ring, seized upon it as a lever towards\r\na more complete autonomy. Men like Mr Rhodes, to whom Africa was an\r\nempire and its people one potential nation, looked on it as the first\r\nstep towards this larger destiny. Every student of political history\r\nfor the last fifty years, considering the physical situation of the\r\ndifferent states and the absence of any final dividing line between\r\nthem, confidently anticipated for South Africa, and under more\r\nfavourable conditions, the development which Australia has already\r\nreached. But the movement shipwrecked on the northern republics. Old\r\ngrievances and jealousies set the Transvaal and the Orange Free State\r\nin arms against the prospect, and, since the essence of federation\r\nis full mutual consent, the project failed at the first hint of\r\nserious opposition. Now all things are changed. The social and\r\nconstitutional difficulties which would obviously arise from the\r\ninclusion of independent or all but independent states in a federation\r\nof colonies have disappeared with the independent states themselves.\r\nNow at last all South Africa save the Portuguese and German seaboards\r\nis under one flag.\r\n\r\nThe chief barriers have gone, but the need for federation is as\r\ninsistent as ever. A common flag is a strong tie, but it does not in\r\npractice prevent many local jealousies and petty oppositions. Disunion\r\nis only justifiable among colonies of equal standing when there is\r\nsome insuperable physical barrier between them or some radical\r\ndisparity of interests. Providence is so clearly on the side of the\r\nlarger social battalions, that an isolated state, though within a\r\ncolonial system, is at a disadvantage even in matters concerning its\r\nown interests. The nationalism which rejoices in local distinctions,\r\nhowever recent in origin, is admirable enough in its way, and ought to\r\nbe preserved; therefore the complete merging of several units in one\r\nis always to be regretted, even when justified by grave needs. The new\r\nstate will never or not for a long time acquire the consistency and\r\nproud self-consciousness of the destroyed units. But federation shows\r\nanother and a better way. The parts are maintained in full national\r\nexistence, but in so far as their interests transcend their own\r\nboundaries they are united in one larger state. There is another\r\nadvantage, often pointed out by American writers on the subject,\r\nwhich concerns a country like South Africa, whose boundaries cannot\r\nyet be said to be finally delimited. North of the Zambesi there is a\r\nvast vague region, partly under the High Commissioner, partly\r\nincluded in British Central Africa, which in time will become\r\nseparate colonies, with interests wholly different from the states of\r\nthe south. To add a new tract and a novel population to a state is\r\nalways a difficult matter, for the existing _regime_ may be most\r\nunsuited for such extension. But it is easy to include a new colony\r\nin a federation. In Mr Bryce's words, federation \"permits an\r\nexpansion, whose extension and whose rate and manner of progress\r\ncannot be foreseen, to proceed with more variety of methods, more\r\nadaptation of laws and administration to the circumstances of each\r\npart of the territory, and altogether in a more truly natural and\r\nspontaneous way than can be expected under a centralised government.\r\nThus the special needs of a new _regime_ are met by the inhabitants\r\nin the way they find best; its special evils are met by special\r\nremedies, perhaps more drastic than an old country demands, perhaps\r\nmore lax than an old country would tolerate; while at the same time\r\nthe spirit of self-reliance among those who build up these new\r\ncommunities is stimulated and respected.\"[34]\r\n\r\nThe need for federation in the case of South Africa is made greater by\r\nthe fact that there are one or two burning questions common to all her\r\nstates which cannot be satisfactorily settled save by joint action.\r\nForemost stands the native problem. If there is not some sort of\r\ngeographical continuity of policy in the treatment of natives, all our\r\nefforts will be unavailing. The natives of South Africa may be\r\nregarded, among other things, as a great industrial reserve; and if\r\nthe policy outlined in another chapter is to be followed, different\r\nlabour laws and different methods of taxation may work incalculable\r\nharm. If extravagant inducements to work are held out in the\r\nTransvaal, it will not be long before the labour market is ruined\r\nelsewhere. If an improvident system of taxation exists in Natal, it\r\nmay unsettle and discontent other native populations, since it is\r\nhighly probable that in the future natives will be less tied to\r\nlocalities, and will move through the whole country in search of work.\r\nThe mining authorities have long recognised the necessity of a single\r\npolicy, as is shown by such institutions as the Chamber of Mines and\r\nthe Native Labour Association; and it would be odd if in political\r\nquestions, where the need is equally urgent, the same truth should be\r\nneglected. In connection with natives the control of the sale of\r\nintoxicants is another matter of South African importance. It is a\r\nmatter on which South Africa is now practically at one; but there are\r\nlimits to the prescience of local legislation and local officials,\r\nand it may easily happen that an inadequate law inadequately\r\nadministered in one colony may undo most of the good that an\r\nenergetic administration is attempting in another. If identity of\r\npolicy, again, is indispensable in relation to the subject races, the\r\nsame identity is most desirable in those inter-racial questions\r\nbetween white men which will long have their place in South African\r\npolitics. An unwise treatment of the Dutch population in the Cape\r\nwill infallibly react on the new colonies. Any one who knows the way\r\nin which Cape precedents in this connection are quoted in the\r\nTransvaal, just as Transvaal precedents were quoted before the war in\r\nthe Cape, will recognise the difficulty which the present disunion\r\ncreates. In educational matters, such as the proportion of time\r\ndevoted to the teaching of the Dutch language, while every colony\r\nmust necessarily decide for itself, there is great need of one\r\ncontrolling authority to supervise and direct. There is, again, the\r\nquestion of permit law and the exclusion of undesirables, and the\r\nkindred matter of the position of the imperial forces. A lax permit\r\nlaw in one colony nullifies all the strictness of its neighbours.\r\nArmy questions--whatever the future position of the South African\r\nforce--will always have an intercolonial significance, for the\r\ndifferent troops are under one commander-in-chief, they will meet for\r\ntraining and manoeuvres, and they are part of one general scheme of\r\nimperial defence. In some questions an attempt at co-operation has\r\nalready been made,--in railway conferences and customs unions,--but\r\nit is obviously a clumsy method which proceeds from conference\r\nagreements to ratification by the several legislatures; and many\r\nimportant and difficult questions will go on arising from day to day\r\nwhich will be decided in quite different ways by local authorities,\r\nto the confusion of all and the increase of unnecessary distinctions.\r\nLastly, there are a number of lesser matters, of which veterinary and\r\ngame regulations may be taken as the type, whose treatment, to be\r\nsatisfactory, must be governed by a common principle and in the hands\r\nof a common executive.\r\n\r\nSuch are a few of the practical reasons for federation. There is a\r\ndeeper reason based on the future of our colonial system. South Africa\r\nat the present moment is deeply cleft by gulfs of race, fiscal policy,\r\nimperial attachment. There will always be within her bounds a party,\r\nnot perhaps a very important or very intelligent party, made up of\r\nthose to whom the British tie is galling and the tradition of kinship\r\nmere foolishness. If the present particularism is allowed to remain\r\nunreformed, it may easily happen that in this colony or that some turn\r\nof the political wheel may give such a party an authoritative voice,\r\nand the result may be the beginning of endless misunderstandings, and\r\nin the end the creation of an impassable gulf. It is because South\r\nAfrica as a whole is so unswerving in her loyalty that it is wise to\r\ncreate some united authority representing the whole land, and looking\r\nat this great question from a high standpoint, which can provide\r\nagainst the parochialism of a party and the accidental caprice of a\r\nstate. This feeling is strong among the English inhabitants of the new\r\ncolonies, and is, I believe, destined to grow in width and strength\r\nthroughout the country, when the fever of reconstruction is at an end\r\nand South Africa has leisure to meditate on her political future.\r\n\r\nIf we examine present conditions we can discern, to borrow the common\r\nmetaphor of writers on federation, both centripetal and centrifugal\r\ntendencies. To begin with, the constitutional framework exists. The\r\nhead of a federation is already at hand in the High Commissioner, in\r\nwhom is vested the government of all South Africa apart from the\r\nself-governing colonies. It was the custom formerly to combine this\r\noffice with the governorship of the Cape: for the moment it is joined\r\nwith the governorship of the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony.\r\nWith the present narrow definition of the High Commissioner's duties,\r\nit is right that this should be so; but there is no constitutional\r\nreason why he should not be a separate official. It has never been a\r\npopular office with self-governing colonies, who dislike the idea that\r\nthe governorship should have in one of its aspects powers over which\r\nthe colony has no control; but this objection could not arise to the\r\nhead of a federal government. By the letters patent of 1900 the High\r\nCommissioner is invested with the control of the South African\r\nConstabulary in the new colonies and the administration of the Central\r\nSouth African railways, and he is empowered to call together\r\nconferences of the self-governing colonies for the discussion of\r\ncommon problems. Here is already existing the administrative machinery\r\nof a federation. The rock on which many federal enterprises have split\r\nis the election of the supreme head, and in most systems it is the\r\nweakest point. But South Africa is saved this part of the problem. She\r\nhas a supreme federal office, which has existed for more than twenty\r\nyears, and with the slightest alteration of functions the High\r\nCommissionership could be transformed into a Federal Viceroyalty.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa, again, is for all practical purposes a geographical\r\nwhole. The vast tableland which makes up nine-tenths of it has\r\nalmost everywhere uniform climatic conditions, and the strips of\r\ncoast land have among themselves a comparatively uniform character,\r\nso that two types may be said to exhaust its geographical and\r\nclimatic features. There is no distinction so radical as between the\r\nAtlantic states and Texas or between Nebraska and the Pacific\r\nseaboard. This physical harmony prevents any natural cleavages, such\r\nas impassable mountain-ranges or large navigable rivers; and it\r\nimposes upon the inhabitants uniformity in modes of travel, and in\r\nthe simpler conditions of life. If we look at the people of the\r\nseveral states we find a common nationality--or rather a common\r\nadmixture of nationalities. The English proportion may be much higher\r\nin Natal and the eastern province of Cape Colony, the Dutch in the\r\nwestern province and the Orange River Colony; but everywhere there is\r\nthe same divided race, and in consequence kindred political problems.\r\nThere is, further, one supreme Imperial Government for all, one\r\nconstitutional tradition to provide, as it were, a background to local\r\npolitics and a basis for federation. There are common dangers from\r\ninvasion, against which all the colonies are protected by one navy.\r\nSubject to minor local differences, there is a common structure\r\nobservable in the constitutions of the several self-governing colonies\r\nto which the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will no doubt in time\r\napproximate. Many of the most vital problems are the same for the\r\nwhole of South Africa,--the control and the civilisation of the\r\nnatives, the amalgamation of the two white races, the conservation of\r\nwater, the protection against pests and stock diseases. Two of the\r\nmost important administrative departments have already a common basis,\r\nif they are still far from complete union. All South African railway\r\nsystems, now that the old Beira line has been relaid, have the same\r\ngauge, their rolling stock is interchangeable, officials pass readily\r\nfrom one system to another, and by means of railway conferences\r\nattempts have been made to arrive at a common understanding on railway\r\npolicy. Finally, all South Africa is now united in one Customs Union.\r\n\r\nBut if the centripetal elements,[35] which make for federation, are\r\nnumerous and potent, disjunctive and centrifugal forces also exist,\r\nthough they create no difficulties which a patient statesmanship could\r\nnot surmount. The obvious historical and racial differences between\r\nthe colonies may be neglected, for, though on one side a force of\r\nseparation, they are in another and more important aspect an agency\r\nfor union, since they create a problem which in some form or other\r\nevery colony has to meet. The primary disruptive force is economic.\r\nThe interests, the material interests, of the population of each\r\ncolony are widely different. In Cape Colony, on the whole, the farming\r\ninterest predominates, though there, again, there is an internal\r\ndistinction between the aims of the vine-growing and agricultural\r\nsouth-west and the pastoral north and east. Natal, so far as it is not\r\na huge forwarding agency, is also based on agriculture. The Orange\r\nRiver Colony, though it has a respectable mining interest, is, and\r\nwill doubtless remain, pre-eminently a pastoral state. The development\r\nof Rhodesia is not yet quite apparent, but it is probable that it will\r\nend by having a mining and a farming interest of about equal strength.\r\nBut the Transvaal is overwhelmingly industrial both in population and\r\nprospects. In time, no doubt, Transvaal agriculture will play an\r\nimportant part, but the main asset of the colony must long be found\r\nin her mines, and the subsidiary industries created by them, which\r\nwill be left as a legacy when the reefs are worked out to the last\r\npennyweight. That is to say, in South Africa there are three colonies\r\nwhere the predominant interest is agricultural,--one in which the\r\nmining and farming interests are likely to be evenly matched, and one,\r\nthe richest and therefore not the least important, in which the mining\r\ninterest casts all others into the shade. It is obvious that economic\r\npolicy will vary greatly in each, even in those general matters which\r\nwould naturally fall under the survey of a federal government. The\r\nbias of the agricultural colonies is towards protection; the absolute\r\nnecessity of Rhodesia and the Transvaal is free trade or a near\r\napproach to it. The industrial population of the Rand must have food\r\nat a reasonable price, else the labour bill will wipe off the profits\r\nof the mines, and to secure this cheap food, taking into consideration\r\nthe long railway freights, entry at the coast free of duty is desired.\r\nSo too with the raw material of mining: any taxation of such imports\r\nis directly inimical to the prosperity of South Africa's foremost\r\nindustry. On the other hand, the coast farmers have good grounds to\r\ncomplain. They look to the Rand for their market, and unless they are\r\nto be secured from the competition of lands like the Argentine, where\r\nfood-stuffs can be grown almost as a waste product, they will grumble\r\nagainst any rebate of coast duties.\r\n\r\nThe deadlock might be final were it not for the geographical position\r\nof the Transvaal. Had she a port of her own she might well decline any\r\nfederation, and continue to import on her own terms, leaving the other\r\ncolonies to make the best of it. But, as things stand, she has to\r\nbring in most of her imports through ports in the coast colonies, and\r\nfor a large part of the distance over their lines of railway. Were\r\nthis, again, a full statement of the case, the Transvaal might be at\r\nthe mercy of the other colonies, and be compelled to accept their\r\nterms or starve. But fortunately the Transvaal, while not in a\r\nposition to dictate absolutely, has a card of her own by which she can\r\ncommand reasonable treatment. She can import by the much shorter line\r\nfrom Delagoa Bay, and she is contemplating the construction of an\r\nalternative line to the same port. These two lines, when completed,\r\nwill make her virtually independent of the coast colonies, provided--a\r\nprovision which there seems no reason to doubt--a good understanding\r\nis maintained with Portugal. Clearly some _modus vivendi_ must be\r\narrived at if there is not to be an endless friction, which can only\r\nresult in inconvenience to the interior colony and great financial\r\nloss to the coast.[36]\r\n\r\nThis chief centrifugal force, divergence of economic interests,\r\nbecomes, therefore, in practice a powerful centripetal force, the\r\nchief lever of federation. Some kind of harmony must be attained; the\r\nonly question is whether this agreement is to be partial and temporary\r\nor thorough and final. Federation, while on its practical side a\r\nfamiliar policy to all classes in South Africa, is still in its\r\npolitical aspect a little strange to men's minds, smacking somewhat of\r\nconstitutional doctrinairedom. When we are dealing with self-governing\r\ncolonies, there can be no question of imposing it as a mandate from\r\nabove: to be effective and permanent it must come from within, a\r\nproposal based on a national conviction. There was, indeed, a time in\r\nthe last year of the war when Cape Colony lay in the throes of\r\ndisruption, and her wisest citizens were weary of the vagaries of her\r\npolitics; when Natal was acquiescent, and when the new colonies were\r\nstill a battlefield. It seemed to many that then a federation might\r\nhave been imposed with the consent of most thinking men. But the\r\nmoment passed; local politics were restored to their old activity, and\r\nthe opportunity for imperial interference was gone. A federal movement\r\nmust therefore advance slowly and circumspectly, and be content with\r\nsmall beginnings, lest any hint of coercion should drive the units\r\nstill farther apart.\r\n\r\nThere is no argument so convincing as success, and a satisfactory\r\nfederation in miniature would go far to prepare the way for the larger\r\nscheme. Fortunately we have one sphere where experiments towards\r\nfederation can be given a fair trial. The Transvaal and the Orange\r\nRiver Colony are under one governor and the same system of government.\r\nThough they have many points of difference, they have also many common\r\nproblems which are even now dealt with by one central authority. The\r\nSouth African Constabulary in the two colonies is one force under one\r\nInspector-General. The Central South African railways, which control\r\nthe whole railway system, are under one Railway Commissioner and one\r\nGeneral Manager. Education is under one Director of Education. In\r\naddition to this departmental union, the two colonies are subject to\r\none common debt, the Guaranteed Loan. The War Debt lies for the\r\npresent wholly on the Transvaal;[37] but the loan for reconstruction\r\nis devoted to purposes common to both, and they are jointly and\r\nseverally liable for its interest and redemption. If the Orange River\r\nColony were to pay its fair share of the interest--having regard to\r\nthe capital expenditure apportioned to it--it would be bankrupt\r\nto-morrow. It must either pay a great deal less than its due, or some\r\narrangement must be arrived at by which there is no fixed apportionment\r\nof either interest or capital, but the whole debt is administered\r\njointly, and charged upon certain common properties.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted has been fully explained in another chapter. Here\r\nit will be sufficient to point out the federal consequences of the\r\narrangement. If the railways, the South African Constabulary, and all\r\ncommon services are to be charged to one common budget, and subjected\r\nto a common administration, then some kind of common council must be\r\nestablished with a share of both legislative and executive powers. It\r\nwould be necessary to give this council, or some committee of it, the\r\nfinal decision in railway administration, to grant it power to operate\r\nupon railway profits, and to make grants for the services of the loan,\r\nand for other services placed under its authority, without reference\r\nto the councils of the separate colonies. Such powers have not been\r\nunknown in constitutional history, and Austro-Hungary furnishes an\r\ninstructive precedent. There we find a common executive, not\r\nresponsible to either of the two Parliaments, for such common\r\ninterests as foreign affairs, the army, and imperial finance. On most\r\nmatters connected with these common interests the separate Parliaments\r\nlegislate; but the voting of money for common purposes and the control\r\nof the common executive is placed in the hands of the famous\r\nDelegations, which are appointed by the two Parliaments. The position\r\nis, therefore, that there is a common Ministry for Finance, War, and\r\nForeign Affairs, controlled by the Delegations, and working on funds\r\nvoted and appropriated by the Delegations. This power of appropriation\r\nwithout ratification by the separate colonies is the essence of the\r\nnew council, which is thus, to continue the parallel, a compound of\r\nthe Delegations and the Common Ministry of Austro-Hungary. Certain\r\nfunds are ear-marked for its use, and its deficits, if any, will be\r\nmet by contributions, in certain fixed proportions, from the\r\ntreasuries of the two colonies; while its surplus, if it is ever\r\nfortunate enough to have one, will be divided, in whole or in part,\r\nbetween the two colonies, going as a matter of fact to assist in\r\nmeeting the charges of the War Debt. It has an administrative control\r\nover all existing common services, and any other which may be\r\nsubsequently put under its charge by the local legislatures.\r\n\r\nSuch a council obviously falls far short of a true federation. It is\r\nprimarily a financial expedient to provide a simple and effective\r\nmachinery for administering somewhat complicated finances. But it is a\r\nstep, and a considerable step, in the right direction. Its executive\r\nfunctions are concerned with truly federal matters; and its powers of\r\nacting alone in questions of administration, and of voting and\r\nappropriating funds without reference to the separate legislatures, is\r\na recognition of the central doctrine of federation. Indeed at the\r\npresent moment the two new colonies have a _de facto_ federal\r\ngovernment. The grant to the new council of legislative powers on\r\nmatters of common interest, and the corresponding limitation of the\r\npowers of the separate legislatures, would establish a complete _de\r\njure_ federation. There is no reason why this goal should not soon be\r\nreached. The two colonies are bound together by many ties,--above\r\nall, by that most stringent bond, a common debt. For three years they\r\nhave been administered by one governor. Though there may be symptoms\r\nof local jealousy in both, there can be no real popular objection, as\r\nthere is no logical reason, against their federation.\r\n\r\nBut while the new colonies present a simple problem, the extension of\r\nthe policy to the self-governing colonies requires delicate and\r\ncautious handling. If the limited federation be a success, it will\r\nhave the power of a good example, especially since there are many\r\nthroughout South Africa to seize and emphasise the lesson. Meantime\r\nother agencies are at work for union. The Bloemfontein Conference of\r\nMarch 1903, which, in addition to settling a customs' tariff and\r\nrecommending a preferential policy for British goods, passed\r\nresolutions on certain questions, such as native affairs, of wide\r\nSouth African interest, is the type of that informal advisory union\r\nwhich may well come into being at once. The appointment, further, of a\r\nSouth African committee to investigate some of the more vexed and\r\nobscure details of native policy, is another step in the same\r\ndirection. The new colonies, which contain the chief motive force for\r\nSouth Africa's future, must give the lead. They hold in their hands\r\nthe guide-ropes, for federation may be said to depend upon the\r\ndevelopment of two problems--the racial and the economic; and both\r\nreach their typical form in the new colonies. In these questions are\r\ninvolved the chief grounds of separation and the chief impulses towards\r\nunion, and according as the new colonies settle them within their own\r\nbounds will arise the need and desire for a more comprehensive\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe type of federation which South Africa may adopt will, no doubt,\r\nvary considerably from most historical precedents. It should in\r\ncertain respects be more rigid, since, apart from a few outstanding\r\ntroubles, there are no permanent differences between the parts. In\r\ncertain respects, too, it should be more elastic, for a federated\r\nSouth Africa would be not only a substantive state, but a member of a\r\ngreater system, and some of the old free colonial traditions which\r\npertain to that system should be left to the federated units. It is a\r\nvain task at this stage to attempt the outlines of a scheme, since the\r\nfoundations are not yet fully apparent. Needs which are now in embryo\r\nwill be factors to be reckoned with when the time is ripe, and perhaps\r\nsome of the forces which seem to us to-day to dominate all else will\r\nhave disappeared or decreased in strength. There is a wealth of\r\nhistorical precedent for South African statesmen to follow; for, apart\r\nfrom the United States and sundry European parallels, there are two\r\ntypes of federation within the colonial system--the Dominion of Canada\r\nand the recently created Australian Commonwealth. Between them these\r\ntwo cases provide a most complete parallel for South Africa. In Canada\r\nthere was a distinction of races not less marked than Dutch and\r\nEnglish. There was, further, an imperfectly explored hinterland which\r\nthe colonists looked to bring by degrees under the same constitution.\r\nIn Australia there were grave intercolonial disputes on railways and\r\ncustoms and a wide divergence of economic interests. A keen jealousy\r\nwas felt by the smaller for the larger states, and the scheme of\r\nfederation had to be delicately framed to adjust state pride with\r\nfederal requirements. On the whole, the difficulties which the\r\nframers of the federal constitution had to face in Canada and\r\nAustralia were greater than we find in South Africa: in the United\r\nStates, immeasurably greater. But often the probability of federation\r\nstands in inverse ratio to the ease with which it can be effected,\r\nand the very simplicity of this South African problem may delay its\r\nsettlement. There are, however, forces which must between them hasten\r\nthe end. One is the economic disparity, at least as great as in\r\nAustralia and greater than in Canada, which makes itself felt so\r\nconstantly in the daily life of the inland colonies, that they may\r\nfind themselves compelled to push the matter in spite of the apathy\r\nof the coast. The other is the very real national sentiment which is\r\ngrowing to maturity in the country. The war has welded the English\r\ninhabitants into something approaching a nation. Having suffered so\r\ndeeply, they are the less prone to local jealousies and the more\r\nattached to the ideal of imperial unity.\r\n\r\nA scheme of South African federation, as has been said, will have to\r\ndiffer materially from any of the existing types. Though details are\r\npremature, certain principles may be accepted as essential. The first\r\nconcerns the subjects relegated to the Federal Government. In the\r\nUnited States these are, roughly, foreign affairs, the army and navy,\r\nfederal courts of justice, commerce, currency, the post office, certain\r\ngeneral branches of commercial law, such as copyrights and patents, an\r\noversight of the separate states to protect the inhabitants against any\r\ninfringement of the fundamental rights granted by the constitution, and\r\ntaxation for federal purposes. Several of these functions are needless\r\nin a federation of English colonies. Foreign affairs and army and navy\r\nquestions assume a different form from what they present in a wholly\r\nseparate community; and since there is no _Grondwet_ known to English\r\nconstitutional law, there is no need for an oversight of the separate\r\nstates in case of its infringement. That is already provided for by the\r\nultimate right of the British Crown to annul legislation which may\r\nconflict with the chartered rights or limitations of a colony. But\r\nthere are certain powers, not referred to in the American scheme,\r\nwhich are essential to a modern system. Railways, telephones, and\r\ntelegraphs should come under the purview of the national Government,\r\nas also all customs tariffs and all bounties which may be granted on\r\nproduction. Powers must be given to the national Government to take\r\nover the existing debts of the separate states, and in times of\r\nfinancial distress to come to their assistance. On judicial and legal\r\nquestions--the nature of the federal courts, the mechanism of appeal,\r\nthe branches of law which are suitable for federal jurisdiction--it is\r\nimpossible to speak; as it is premature to attempt an outline of the\r\nconstitution of the federal Government, the form of its legislation,\r\nthe functions of its executive. Such questions require long and\r\ncareful consideration on the part of the South African colonies, and\r\nmay happily take their colour, when the time arrives, from some\r\naccepted scheme of imperial federation. Two points only may be noted\r\nas even now obvious desiderata of policy. In Canada the state\r\ngovernors are appointed by the federal Ministry; in Australia they are\r\nnominated by the Crown in the same way as the Governor-General.\r\nExperience has shown that the Australian method is the superior one,\r\nsince it allows a state governor and his ministers to communicate\r\ndirectly with the imperial Government, and so preserve a formal\r\nindependence which is at once harmless and grateful to state pride. It\r\nis impossible to doubt that the Australian precedent should be\r\nfollowed in South Africa. The second point concerns the method of\r\neffecting federation. The Canadian scheme was based on resolutions\r\ndrafted by a conference of delegates at Quebec. They were approved by\r\nthe legislatures of the provinces, embodied in a bill drafted by a\r\ncommittee of Canadian statesmen, and passed by the imperial Government.\r\nFederation was thus, as in the United States, the work of conferences\r\nand legislatures alone. Australia, recognising that this was a question\r\nwhich deeply concerned the population of the colonies, followed a\r\nbetter plan. The federal constitution, after passing through a long\r\nperiod of conferences and examinations by state legislatures, was\r\nsubmitted to a direct popular vote, and a certain majority was\r\nprescribed for it in each state. Such a federation, secured by the\r\nconsent of a whole people, has a stability against future attacks and\r\ncaptious emendation which belongs to no scheme sanctioned only by a\r\nlegislative body. For though popular representation is in theory a\r\nrepresentation for all things, yet a matter so vital in its application\r\nand so far-reaching in its issues deserves to be made the subject of a\r\nspecial mandate.\r\n\r\nI have said that foreign affairs and army and navy questions do not,\r\nunder the ordinary practice of the colonial system, have much\r\nconnection with colonial governments, and therefore may be left out of\r\nmost federal proposals. But though the technical last word may never\r\nlie with the Federal Government, yet a South African federation would\r\nhave genuine foreign interests, and would keep a watchful eye on the\r\nmovements of the colonising Powers of Europe. Had there been a\r\nfederation, there would have been no German acquisition of Damaraland,\r\nnor would we have found imperial authorities refusing the offer of\r\nLourenco Marques for a trifling sum. No colonist can ever quite\r\nforgive those memorable blunders, which prevented British South Africa\r\nfrom having that geographical unity from the Zambesi to the Cape which\r\nits interests demand. Thirty years ago it would have been easy for\r\nBritain to proclaim a Monroe doctrine for South Africa--for that\r\nmatter of it, for East Africa also. The opportunity has passed, but a\r\nstrong national Government could still exercise great influence on\r\nforeign affairs, and prevent encroachment upon Portuguese territories\r\nby that Power which twenty years ago saw in Africa material for a new\r\nGerman Empire and has never forgotten its grandiose dreams, as well as\r\nkeep an eye upon that dangerous mushroom growth, the Congo Free State,\r\nand check its glaring offences against civilisation. Army and navy\r\nquestions belong, in their broadest sense, to schemes of imperial\r\nfederation, a discussion of which here would be out of place; but\r\nsince there is already in South Africa a large military force under\r\none commander-in-chief, certain army questions arise which may find\r\ntheir proper answer only in federation, but which even now require a\r\nprovisional settlement. According as we treat the matter, it may\r\nbecome a unifying or a violently disjunctive force, a step towards\r\nfederation or a movement towards a wider disintegration. The bearing\r\nof the army question on South African policy is the subject of another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [34]  American Commonwealth, vol. i. p. 465.\r\n\r\n  [35]  The grounds of Australian federation are a useful\r\n        parallel for South Africa. I give Mr Bryce's list\r\n        ('Studies in History and Jurisprudence,' vol. i. p.\r\n        478): \"The gain to trade and the general convenience to\r\n        be expected from abolishing the tariffs established on\r\n        the frontiers of each colony; the need for a common\r\n        system of military defence; the advantages of a common\r\n        legislature for the regulation of railways and the\r\n        fixing of railway rates; the advantages of a common\r\n        control of the larger rivers for the purposes both of\r\n        navigation and irrigation; the need for uniform\r\n        legislation on a number of commercial topics; the\r\n        importance of finding an authority competent to provide\r\n        for old-age pensions and for the settlement of labour\r\n        disputes all over the country; the need for uniform\r\n        provision against the entry of coloured races\r\n        (especially Chinese, Malays, and Indian coolies); the\r\n        gain to suitors from the establishment of a High Court\r\n        to entertain appeals and avoid the expense and delay\r\n        involved in carrying cases to the Privy Council in\r\n        England; the probability that money could be borrowed\r\n        more easily on the credit of the Australian Federation\r\n        than by each colony for itself; the stimulus to be given\r\n        to industry and trade by substituting one great\r\n        community for six smaller ones; the possibility of\r\n        making better arrangements for the disposal of the\r\n        unappropriated lands belonging to some of the colonies\r\n        than could be made by those colonies for themselves.\"\r\n\r\n  [36]  A provisional _modus vivendi_ has been found in the new\r\n        Customs Union. See p. 238.\r\n\r\n  [37]  There is a contingent liability on the Orange River\r\n        Colony to pay a sum of L5,000,000, as its special\r\n        contribution, from any profit which may fall to its\r\n        Government from the discovery of precious minerals. See\r\n        p. 245.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY AND SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foremost political lesson of the late war was the solidarity of\r\nmilitary spirit throughout the Empire. But this cohesion is only in\r\nspirit, and the actual position of colonial forces is that of isolated\r\nunits, connected in no system, and subject to no central direction.\r\nFor a student of military law, or that branch of it which concerns the\r\nrelation of military forces to the civil power, a survey of the\r\nBritish colonies has much curious interest. Speaking generally, since\r\n1868 there have been no imperial forces in any self-governing colony,\r\nsince we have acted on the principle that when a colony became\r\nautonomous the defence of its borders, except by sea, must be left to\r\nits own government. Colonial troops are, therefore, militia and\r\nvolunteer, who take different forms according to the needs of the\r\ncolony. In some the militia, or a part of it, is to all intents a\r\nregular force, performing garrison duty and acting as a school of\r\ninstruction for the other auxiliary forces. In Canada, for example,\r\nthere were in 1902 a troop of cavalry, a troop of mounted rifles, two\r\nbatteries of field artillery, two companies of garrison artillery, and\r\na battalion of infantry, in which the men were enlisted for three\r\nyears' continuous service. In New South Wales, to take one state of\r\nthe Australian Commonwealth, provision was made for a permanent\r\nforce, which included a half-squadron of cavalry, three companies of\r\ngarrison artillery and one field battery, a company of infantry and\r\nvarious supplementary services, with men enlisted for five years. In\r\nNew Zealand the enlistment for the permanent force, which consists of\r\nartillery and submarine miners, is for eight years, three of which\r\nmay be passed in the reserve. Next comes the militia proper on the\r\nhome model, where the men are partially paid and are subject to a\r\ncertain amount of annual training. Lastly there is a wide volunteer\r\norganisation, stretching from fully organised companies of infantry\r\nand mounted rifles down to small local rifle clubs. In certain\r\ncolonies where there is an aboriginal or unsettled population, such\r\nas Canada, Cape Colony, and Natal, there is also a permanently\r\nembodied police force, which may rank with the permanent militia as a\r\nsort of colonial regulars. All such forces are under the full control\r\nof the Colonial Governments, whether, as in the Australian Commonwealth\r\nand Canada, under the Federal Ministry of Defence, or, as in Cape\r\nColony, under the department of the Prime Minister. An imperial officer\r\nmay be lent, as in Canada and Australia to-day, for the command of the\r\ncolonial force, but as soon as he enters upon his command he becomes a\r\nservant of the Colonial Government. To that Government alone belongs\r\nthe power of raising new forces, of changing the status of existing\r\ntroops, of ordering their distribution, of regulating their rates of\r\npay, and of lending them for service beyond the colony. A strong\r\ngeneral officer commanding may have great influence in all such\r\ndecisions, but technically he is merely an adviser who receives his\r\norders from the local authorities.\r\n\r\nThis is one chief type of the organisation of our over-sea imperial\r\nforce. The other is furnished by India. There we have a native Indian\r\narmy, and a large number of imperial troops, all of whom are under the\r\nauthority of the commander-in-chief in India, who in turn is under the\r\ncontrol of the Indian Government. When imperial troops are stationed\r\nin any other part of the Empire they are commanded by an officer who\r\nis directly subject to the War Office; but in India, as soon as a\r\nbattalion lands it takes the status of the local forces and passes\r\nunder the authority of the local government. The War Office retains\r\ncertain powers, but for all practical purposes the Indian command is\r\nwholly decentralised.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa affords the spectacle of a confusion of the two types. It\r\nis made up partly of Crown colonies and dependencies and partly of\r\nself-governing states. At this moment it is occupied by imperial troops\r\nwhose numbers, for the purpose of this argument, may be put at 30,000.\r\nSuch troops are stationed in Cape Colony and Natal as well as in the\r\nnew colonies, and the command has been unified and vested in one\r\ncommander-in-chief, who is subject only to the War Office and has no\r\nresponsibility to the local governments. We have, therefore, the\r\nanomalous case of an autonomous colony occupied by imperial troops, a\r\npolicy which is out of line with English practice. When self-government\r\nis given to the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, the South\r\nAfrican general will command what will be neither more nor less than an\r\nalien army of occupation. At the same time, wholly apart from the\r\nregular forces, there are police troops in Natal, Cape Colony, the new\r\ncolonies, and Rhodesia; and a large number of volunteer regiments, who\r\nare directly under the control of the local governments. The South\r\nAfrican military organisation is thus split in two by a deep gulf, and\r\nunless some method of union is found, we shall be confronted with a\r\nsystem alien to the tradition of our colonial policy and in itself\r\nclumsy and unworkable. But this question is intimately bound up with\r\nothers--the desirability of the retention of imperial troops, the\r\norganisation of such troops in relation to the imperial army, indeed\r\nthe whole question of that branch of imperial federation which is\r\nconcerned with the defence of the Empire. It involves certain problems\r\nof military reform which are violently contested by good authorities.\r\nIn this chapter it is proposed, as far as possible, to consider the\r\nmatter of the South African army solely from the standpoint of South\r\nAfrican politics, referring to the military aspect only in so far as\r\nmay be necessary at points where South African politics are merged in\r\nwider schemes of imperial unity.\r\n\r\nThe first question concerns the policy of keeping imperial troops in\r\nSouth Africa at all. The size of the force depends, of course, on the\r\nduties which it is intended to perform, but for the retention of some\r\ntroops there seems to be every justification. Few people believe that\r\nthere is much likelihood of another outbreak, but after a war of the\r\nmagnitude of that which we have recently gone through it would seem\r\nscarcely provident to leave the peace of the country solely to the\r\ncare of the police. In a country, again, where British prestige is a\r\nplant of recent growth, it is well to provide the moral support of\r\nregular battalions. If useful for no other purpose, they serve as a\r\nmemento of war, a constant reminder of the existence of an imperial\r\npower behind all local administration. We have also to face the fact\r\nthat we have committed ourselves to some kind of occupation force by\r\nundertaking a large preliminary expenditure on cantonments, which will\r\nbe money wasted if the scheme is dropped. For this purpose we have\r\nspent between two and three millions, and unless we are to be held\r\nguilty of causeless extravagance, we must abide by the plan to which\r\nthis outlay has committed us.\r\n\r\nThe original scheme was for a garrison force. For this purpose 30,000\r\nmen are too many if our forecast be correct, and far too few if it be\r\nwrong. Half the number would be ample for any peace establishment, and\r\nwe may be perfectly certain that as soon as self-government is\r\ndeclared in the new colonies there would be many attempts to cut down\r\nthe number or do away with the force altogether. Alien garrison troops\r\nwill be always unpopular, and, as has been said, they are foreign to\r\nBritish policy with regard to autonomous colonies. A force on the\r\ngarrison basis would find itself with little to do, the general\r\ncommanding would be exposed to the jealousy of the colonial troops,\r\nand involved in constant difficulties with the colonial governments,\r\nand, save in the unlikely event of a rebellion, would have no very\r\nobvious justification for the existence of his command.\r\n\r\nIf South Africa is to remain a station for any considerable number of\r\nimperial troops, some mode of co-operation must be discovered with the\r\nlocal governments. This co-operation would be possible between the\r\ncolonial administration and a garrison force; but it would be\r\ninfinitely more satisfactory if the whole status of the imperial\r\ntroops were changed. For a garrison establishment makes it difficult,\r\nif not impossible, not only to bring the general commanding into\r\ntouch with the governments, but to bring the local troops into line\r\nwith the regular, and both unions must be accomplished before any\r\nsatisfactory settlement can be given to the problem. The simplest\r\nsolution was to treat the South African force, not as a garrison, but\r\nas part of the regular army on the home establishment, sent there for\r\nthe purpose of training, and liable to be utilised at any moment for\r\nactive service in any part of the Empire. There are certain objections\r\nto the scheme, plausible enough though not insuperable, from the\r\nmilitary standpoint; but for the present we may limit our argument to\r\nthose points which concern South Africa, and those difficulties which\r\nspring from the nature of the country--difficulties which are far more\r\nreal to the soldiers who are directly concerned than the wider\r\nquestion of the present scheme of military organisation.\r\n\r\nThe advantages are sufficiently obvious. There are few finer\r\nmanoeuvring grounds in the world than the great Central South\r\nAfrican tableland. There is sufficient cover to make scouting possible\r\nand not enough to make it easy, and the intense clearness of the air\r\nand its singular acoustic properties will train a man's senses to a\r\nperfection unknown in other armies and impossible to acquire in the\r\nrestricted areas of a populous country. The soldier will have to face\r\nthe rudiments of war in a far more difficult country than he is likely\r\nto be used in. He will learn to shoot, or rather to judge ranges\r\ncorrectly under unwonted conditions, which is rarer and more vital\r\nthan mere accurate marksmanship. He will learn the real roughness of\r\ncampaigning in long manoeuvres; and from the same cause regiments\r\nwill acquire that elasticity and cohesion which come from constant\r\nworking together. If we except enteric, caused by bad sanitation,\r\nwhich has been the curse of the war, but is not a speciality of the\r\ncountry, the veld is almost exempt from diseases. Life there will not\r\nonly train the senses and the intelligence, but will give health and\r\nphysical stamina. A year of such training will make a man of the young\r\nrecruit from the slums of an English city. Physique is the final\r\ndeterminant in war, and with our present system of recruiting and\r\ntraining there is no guarantee for its existence. Lastly, our soldiers\r\ntrained on the veld will become natural horse masters, which few even\r\nof the cavalry are at present. They will learn that care of their\r\nhorses which every Boer has as a birthright, that simple veterinary\r\nskill and common-sense whose lack has cost us so many millions. South\r\nAfrica is a natural horse-breeding country, and in co-operation with\r\nGovernment stud-farms a breed of remounts could be got which would\r\nunite the merits of the Afrikander pony with the weight and bone\r\nrequired for army work. Instead of having to ransack foreign countries\r\nfor our horses, we should breed all we wanted for ourselves under the\r\neye of our imperial officers, and breed them too in a place which is\r\nthe best centre in the Empire for distribution to any possible seat of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe objections to the scheme are partly of sentiment and partly of\r\ntechnical difficulties. South African service, it is said, is at\r\npresent unpopular. Our army has recently concluded a long and arduous\r\nwar, fought under conditions of extreme discomfort. Small wonder if\r\ntroops who have been kicking their heels for eighteen months in remote\r\nblockhouses should have little good to say of the pleasures of the\r\nlife. For the officers there have been dismal quarters, a cheerless\r\ndusty country, heavy expenses, little sport, and no society; and the\r\nlot of the men, though relatively less hard, has been equally\r\ncomfortless. The proper answer to such a contention is to ignore it.\r\nIt is the objection of the non-professional officer, and cannot be\r\nentertained. The forces in South Africa are sent there for training,\r\nnot for garrison life, and if the place is a good training-ground, the\r\nquestion of congenial society and interesting recreation has nothing\r\nto do with the matter.[38] But there is no reason why South African\r\nlife for the future should be unattractive. An English society is\r\nrapidly arising, English sports are becoming popular, the cantonments\r\ncan easily be made comfortable homes, and there are a thousand ways,\r\nsuch as the allotting to each soldier who desires it a small patch of\r\nland to cultivate, in which the men can be made to feel an interest in\r\nthe country. For the officers there is a sporting hinterland as fine\r\nand as accessible as the Pamirs to the Indian sportsman. Living is\r\nundoubtedly more costly, and there will have to be special allowances\r\nfor South African service; but with a proper canteen system, such as\r\nexisted during the war, the cost of luxuries might be kept low enough\r\nfor all. There is a future, too, for the reservist which he cannot\r\nlook for at home. Even as an unskilled workman he can command wages\r\nwhich are unknown in England; and the men who, at the end of their\r\nthree years' service, would join the South African reserve, would be\r\nyoung enough to begin civil life in whatever walk they might choose.\r\n\r\nThe chief technical difficulties, exclusive of sea-transport, which is\r\noutside our review, are the extra cost, the difficulty of recruiting,\r\nand the delays in bringing reservists from home in case of active\r\nservice. The last will be met in a little while by the creation of a\r\nSouth African reserve; but in the meantime there are many ways in\r\nwhich it might be surmounted. Battalions might be brought up to\r\nfighting strength by the inclusion of men from local forces. It would\r\nbe an easy matter to introduce into the terms of enlistment of the\r\nSouth African Constabulary a condition of foreign service, and to keep\r\nfrom 1000 to 2000 men in readiness. It would be possible also to\r\nenlist 1000 men of the Transvaal volunteer force for special foreign\r\nservice, paying to each man a bonus of L12 per annum. The real\r\nsolution of this difficulty is bound up, as we shall see later, with\r\nthe whole theory of a colonial army; but even on the present system it\r\nis easy to provide a working expedient. The question of extra\r\ncost--for each man would require an extra 6d. per day, or L9, 2s. 6d.\r\nper annum--is answered by pointing out that such a force being on the\r\nhome establishment would do away with the necessity of linked\r\nbattalions, and would effect a saving of twenty-four battalions and\r\nsix regiments of cavalry, so that even if the extra cost were 50 per\r\ncent, the total saving would far outbalance it.[39] The recruiting\r\ndifficulty is unlikely to be a serious one. We may lose to the army a\r\nlittle of the loose fringe of half-grown boys from the towns,--stuff\r\nwhich, as history has shown, can be transformed into excellent\r\nfighting men, but which at the same time does not represent the last\r\nword either in moral or physical qualities. But many of the best of\r\nour young men, whose thoughts turn naturally to the colonies, would\r\ngladly seize the chance of three years' service there, in which they\r\nwould gain experience of the new lands, and be able to judge, when\r\ntheir turn came for entering reserves, which line of life promised\r\nmost. No Emigration Bureau or Settlement Board would be so effective\r\nan agency in bringing the right class to the country. But, further,\r\nsuch a system would throw open to us the vast recruiting-grounds of\r\nour colonies. It is difficult for one who has not been brought face to\r\nface with it to realise the military enthusiasm which the war has\r\nkindled not only among the more inflammable, but among the coolest and\r\nshrewdest of our younger colonists. They know--none better--the joints\r\nin our armour; but they have paid generous tribute to the solidarity\r\nof spirit, the gallantry of our leaders, the unbreakable constancy of\r\nour men. A few fanciful war correspondents have done a gross injustice\r\nto our colonial soldiers by painting them as a race of capable\r\nbraggarts, who laughed at our incompetence in a game which they\r\nunderstood so vastly better. It is safe to say that in the better\r\nclass there was no hint of such a spirit; and the way in which\r\nirregular horse, with fine records of service, have traced the source\r\nof victory in the last resort to the stamina of the British infantry,\r\ndoes credit both to their judgment and their chivalry. They have\r\nbecome keen critics of any organisation, looking at war not only with\r\nthe eyes of fighting men but of professional soldiers. All the details\r\nof the profession are of interest to them, and an imperial force in\r\nSouth Africa could draw largely both for officers and men upon the\r\nlocal population. The benefit of such a result, both to the colonies\r\nand to ourselves, is difficult to over-estimate. A common profession\r\nwould do much to smooth away the petty differences which are always\r\napt to widen out gulfs. The army would become a vast nursery of the\r\ntrue imperial spirit, and a school to perpetuate the best of our\r\nEnglish traditions; and would itself gain incalculably by the infusion\r\nof new and virile blood, and the weakening of prejudices, both of\r\nclass and education, which at present are a grave menace to its\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the imperial Government accept the retention of a South African\r\nArmy Corps as part of the home establishment, it is worth while\r\nconsidering how best this new departure in army policy can be used to\r\nfurther the interests of South Africa herself, and those wider\r\nimperial interests which are daily taking concrete shape and casting\r\ntheir shadow over local politics. Leaving for a moment the question of\r\nimperial forces, we find in South Africa a local military activity\r\nwhich, though less completely organised than in some of the older\r\ncolonies, is yet well worth our reckoning with. The war brought into\r\nbeing a large number of irregular corps, most of which have now\r\ndisappeared. In Cape Colony the permanent force is the Cape Mounted\r\nRifles, which has an average strength of 1000 men, enlisted for five\r\nyears, and sworn to \"act as a police force throughout the colony, and\r\nalso as a military force for the defence of the colony.\" Since the war\r\nthe town guards and district mounted troops, the former limited to\r\n10,000 and the latter to 5000 men, have been placed on a permanent\r\nfooting. They are loosely organised volunteer forces, enlisted for no\r\nfixed period, and bound to serve in the one case in the neighbourhood\r\nof the towns, and in the other within their own districts. There are\r\nalso a number of ordinary volunteer corps, composed chiefly of mounted\r\ninfantry, and field and garrison artillery, and a number of mounted\r\nrifle clubs for local defence. All types of corps included, there are\r\nprobably not less than 20,000 men undergoing some kind of military\r\ntraining and pledged to some form of service in Cape Colony alone.\r\nNatal presents a very similar picture. Her regulars are the Natal\r\nPolice Force, with a strength, including the Zululand Police, of\r\nbetween 500 and 600 men, enlisted for three years, and including both\r\nmounted and foot divisions. There is a considerable volunteer force,\r\nwith artillery, infantry, and mounted rifles, two companies of naval\r\nvolunteers, and a number of rifle clubs with a strength of over 2000.\r\nWe may put the defensive strength of Natal, which, considering her\r\nsize, is remarkable, at a little under 5000 men. The British South\r\nAfrican Police, which is stationed in Southern Rhodesia, has a\r\nstrength of a little over 500, and the Southern Rhodesia Constabulary\r\nand volunteers increase the forces of that district to nearly 2000\r\nmen. In the new colonies the chief force is the South African\r\nConstabulary, with a nominal strength of 6000 men, of which two-thirds\r\nare stationed in the Transvaal. It is an expensive force, each man\r\ncosting on an average L250 per annum; but there is reason to believe\r\nthat the figure may soon be reduced to L200, or even less. In the\r\nTransvaal a volunteer force has been organised of nine regiments. No\r\nultimate strength has been fixed, but 10,000 may be taken as a fair\r\nestimate. In April 1903 the force numbered fully 3000, and as the\r\ncountry becomes more populous there is little reason to doubt that the\r\nmaximum will be reached.[40]\r\n\r\nThere is thus a force of over 40,000 men engaged in local defence\r\nthroughout South Africa, and of this the 8000 police are for all\r\npractical purposes regular troops. At the present moment the command\r\nof this force is split up among the different colonial governments and\r\nis wholly dissociated from any connection with the command of the\r\nimperial regulars. We have seen that the situation is full of grave\r\ndifficulties for the regulars themselves, since there is no place in\r\ncolonial policy for an alien garrison force. But the strongest\r\nargument in the present system lies not in the difficulties which it\r\ninvolves but in the advantages which it forgoes. We have in South\r\nAfrica a population which, to use Napier's famous distinction, is not\r\nonly bellicose but martial, with a natural aptitude for soldiering and\r\na keen interest in all details of military organisation. Until the\r\nregular command is brought into line with the local forces this genius\r\nwill expend itself on casual volunteering, and when we next call for\r\ncolonial aid we shall have the same haphazard units, instead of\r\ncolonial regiments drilled and manoeuvred on one system and forming\r\na part of some regular division. The arguments for a federation of\r\nthe whole South African command are difficult to meet, and there is\r\nlittle danger of opposition from the local governments. The danger\r\nlies in the fact that it would necessarily involve some reconstruction\r\nof our whole military system, and military conservatism is slow to\r\ndepart from the traditions of the elders.\r\n\r\nIf imperial defence means anything it must include the provision\r\nin every great colonial unit, in Canada, Australia, South\r\nAfrica,--particularly in South Africa,--of a force on the lines of\r\nthe Indian army, with an elastic organisation, embracing both imperial\r\nregulars and local troops. Granted the sanction of the imperial\r\nGovernment, there is no special difficulty in the machinery required\r\nto create it. If South Africa were federated it would be simplicity\r\nitself. All that would be wanted would be to bring the general officer\r\ncommanding the imperial troops, since his command has been unified,\r\ninto relation with the Federal Ministry of Defence, and unite in his\r\nperson the functions which Sir Neville Lyttelton now exercises in\r\nSouth Africa and those which at present belong to Lord Dundonald in\r\nCanada. But, pending federation, we must have recourse to one of those\r\nintercolonial representative bodies which form the thin end of the\r\nfederal wedge. The general commanding would be given the command of\r\nlocal forces by an act of the local legislature, subject in all\r\nquestions of policy, finance, and organisation to the authority of an\r\nintercolonial committee of defence.[41] Each colony would elect two or\r\nmore representatives, on the lines of the present Intercolonial\r\nCouncil of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony; the council thus\r\nformed would be empowered by the legislatures which elect it to decide\r\nwhat share of the cost was to be borne by the separate colonies, to\r\narrange for combined manoeuvres, to supervise appointments, and, in\r\ncase of local wars, to decide what force should be sent to the front,\r\nand in the event of an imperial war, to say what local forces should\r\nbe lent for service. The general commanding would be responsible to\r\nthe War Office for moving imperial troops, subject to its direction,\r\nand for the internal discipline and organisation of the imperial\r\ndivisions. There would, thus, be clearly defined limits of authority\r\nfor both the imperial and local Governments, and at the same time\r\nevery inducement to co-operation. In so far as he was in command of\r\nthe whole of the South African forces, the general commanding would be\r\nsubject in South African matters to the defence committee; while, in\r\nso far as he was in command of imperial troops, he would take his\r\norders on imperial questions, such as a foreign war, from the Home\r\nGovernment. The present officers in command of colonial police and\r\nvolunteers would, of course, come under his authority precisely on\r\nthe same basis as officers of regulars.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of such a scheme are many, both from the standpoint of\r\npolicy and of military efficiency. It would please the colonies, who\r\nwould have an army of their own, drilled on regular lines and\r\naffiliated to the imperial army, and at the same time would feel that\r\nthey had a share in the control of the forces and the military policy\r\nof the Empire. It would ensure the efficiency of local troops, and\r\nwould prepare them for co-operation with the regulars,--not the clumsy\r\npartnership of troops tagged on to a division which cannot use them,\r\nbut the true co-operation which follows on absorption in a larger unit\r\nwith which they have been trained. It would provide an easy means for\r\nthe transfer of colonial officers to imperial regiments, and would act\r\nas a magnet for colonial recruiting. In the case of local wars, as I\r\nhave said, the whole force would be ready to take the field under the\r\norders of the general commanding. In the case of a foreign war the\r\nimperial Government would direct the distribution of the regulars, and\r\nit would be for the committee of defence to say what local troops\r\nshould be lent for foreign service.[42] Beyond this, the only duties\r\nof the War Office would lie in the selection of staff officers and the\r\ngeneral commanding--a matter in which the concurrence of the colonial\r\ngovernments might be obtained as a matter of courtesy. On the\r\nfinancial side it is probable that the scheme would considerably\r\nlessen the burden of defence. The only way in which the colonies can\r\never be expected to contribute to the cost of imperial defence is by\r\nproviding armies and navies of their own. To pay for that which does\r\nnot directly concern you is a form of tax, and so hostile to the\r\nletter and spirit of our colonial traditions. But if local governments\r\nare given a direct interest in an imperial army in which their own\r\ntroops are subsumed, and whose policy they largely control, I do not\r\nthink they will be ungenerous. There is no reason why they should not\r\nmeet the cost of the general and his staff, and contribute part, if not\r\nthe whole, of the extra pay which the regular troops in the South\r\nAfrican command must receive, and the bonus to the volunteer corps\r\nwhich are held ready for foreign service. Such payments, once the\r\nfederation were effected, would no doubt come as a spontaneous offer.\r\nDecentralisation and centralisation are, by way of becoming catchwords,\r\nrepeated without understanding to justify the most diverse schemes. But\r\nevery true policy must include both, since in certain matters it is\r\nwell to decentralise, and in others unification is imperative. Such a\r\nscheme as has been sketched combines the sporadic colonial forces in\r\none effective unit of organisation, and at the same time relieves the\r\ntension at imperial headquarters by relegating detailed administration\r\nto the local authorities, who are best fitted to supervise.\r\n\r\nThe military is, as a rule, the most difficult aspect of a federation,\r\nbut in our circumstances it is likely to be the simplest. We have a\r\nfederal nucleus in the imperial command, and a strong impulse in the\r\nfact that the local volunteer and police forces have already served\r\nside by side with regulars in the field, and are inspired with a\r\nmilitary spirit which may soon disappear unless fostered and utilised.\r\nA federation of local forces exists in Canada and in the Australian\r\nCommonwealth; a union of the imperial forces exists in South Africa.\r\nThe problem is to federate the local forces in advance of a political\r\nfederation, and to unite them with the imperial command in a system\r\nwhich, though a new departure in military policy, contains no detail\r\nwhich has not been somewhere or other already conceded. If the scheme\r\nin itself is worth anything, the practical difficulties are small. It\r\nis unlikely that the colonial governments will offer any opposition;\r\nand so far as South African interests are concerned, the foundations\r\nwould be laid of a true federation. From the point of view of imperial\r\npolitics the step would have an even greater significance, for a type\r\nwould be created of a new army organisation which would provide for a\r\nfederated imperial defence; and the precedent having once been\r\ncreated, the other colonies would readily follow suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [38]  The final answer to this objection would be the\r\n        reorganisation of the militia--the only force for home\r\n        defence--and the release of the present regular army\r\n        for service over-sea.\r\n\r\n  [39]  I have thought it unnecessary to recapitulate in detail\r\n        the financial argument used by advocates of this policy.\r\n        Roughly it is as follows: The present Army Corps system\r\n        provides for 78 battalions at home, 66 in India, and 12\r\n        in South Africa--a total of 156. The proposed system\r\n        provides for 42 at home, 24 in South Africa, and 66 in\r\n        India--a total of 132. There is thus a saving of 24\r\n        battalions, besides 6 regiments of cavalry.\r\n\r\n        In figures, 24 battalions at L64,000  =  L1,536,000\r\n        And 6 cavalry regiments at   L45,000  =    L270,000\r\n                                                 ----------\r\n                                  A total of     L1,806,000\r\n\r\n        Including supplementary expenses, the total reductions\r\n        would be over L2,000,000.\r\n\r\n  [40]  The details of the force may be of interest. In April\r\n        1903 it consisted of two regiments of the Imperial Light\r\n        Horse, one regiment of the South African Light Horse,\r\n        one regiment of the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles, one\r\n        regiment of the Scottish Horse, one regiment of the\r\n        Central South African Railway Volunteers, one regiment\r\n        of the Transvaal Light Infantry, one regiment of\r\n        Transvaal Scottish, one regiment of Railway Pioneers, a\r\n        medical staff corps, and a headquarters' staff. The\r\n        names of some of the most famous irregular corps are\r\n        thus perpetuated. A new regiment--the Northern\r\n        Rifles--has recently been formed at Pretoria.\r\n\r\n  [41]  A committee of defence has been formed in Natal,\r\n        consisting of the officers commanding the imperial and\r\n        the local forces and representatives of the local\r\n        government.\r\n\r\n  [42]  This scheme would involve a departure from the present\r\n        military organisation on the basis of army corps. We\r\n        cannot expect to get an army corps for each colonial\r\n        district, and the advantages disappear if such\r\n        reinforcements are to be distributed to make up the\r\n        strength of the army corps drawn from the whole Empire.\r\n        The unit must be smaller--something in the nature of a\r\n        division of, say, three brigades with one brigade of\r\n        mounted troops. In South Africa we could have several\r\n        divisions of regulars and several of local troops. The\r\n        system would have the merit of harmonising with the\r\n        organisation of the army in India, where reinforcements\r\n        are most likely to be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OUTLOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problems discussed in the foregoing chapters have been concerned\r\nchiefly with the new colonies, for it is to them that we must look\r\nfor the motive force to expedite union. They must long continue to\r\nbe the most important factor in British South Africa, partly from\r\ntheir accidental position as the late theatre of war, and more\r\nespecially from their wealth, the intricacy of their politics, the\r\nhigh level of ability among their inhabitants, the splendid chances\r\nof their future, and the delicacy of their present status. Union, if\r\nit comes, will come chiefly because of them; and in any union they\r\nwill play a great, if not a dominant, part. Whither they pipe, South\r\nAfrica must ultimately follow. But this is not because there can be\r\nany differentiation in value between the states, since all are\r\nself-subsistent and independent, but because in the new colonies the\r\nproblems which chiefly concern South Africa's future are already\r\nnaked to the eye and focussed for observation. The Transvaal will be\r\nimportant because within it the fight which concerns the whole\r\nfuture of the African colony will be fought to a finish. It will add\r\nto the problem some features which concern only itself, but the\r\ngeneral lines it shares with its neighbours. The economic strife,\r\nthe amalgamation of races, the native question, the movement towards\r\nfederation, with all its many aspects, and, last but not least, the\r\nintellectual and political development of its citizens,--this is the\r\nproblem of the Transvaal, and in the gravest sense it is the problem\r\nof South Africa's future.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages the separate questions have been briefly\r\nconsidered. But here we may note one truth which attaches to them\r\nall--the settlement of no single one is easy. Each will defy a supine\r\nstatesmanship, and in each failure will be attended with serious\r\ndisaster. Patience and a lithe intelligence can alone ensure success,\r\nand it is doubtful if that happy Providence which has now and then taken\r\ncharge of our drifting and muddling will interfere in this province to\r\nsave us from the consequences of folly. Every question stands on a\r\nneedle-point. Mining development--if the wealth of the country is to be\r\nproperly exploited--must continue as it has begun, utilising the highest\r\nengineering talent, and straining every nerve to extend the area over\r\nwhich profits can be made. The labour question requires tact and\r\npatience, prescience of future interests, a recognition of the needs of\r\nthe complex organism of which it is but one aspect. The native question\r\nshows the same narrow margin between success and failure, and demands a\r\ndegree of forethought and statesmanship which would be an exorbitant\r\nrequirement were it not so vital a part of the social and economic\r\nfuture. Agriculture and settlement can only be made valuable by a close\r\nstudy of facts, and an intelligence which can correctly estimate data\r\nand bring to bear on them the latest results of experimental science.\r\nFinally, in its financial aspects the problem has a near resemblance to\r\nthe most complicated of recent economic tasks, the re-settlement of\r\nEgypt. Burdened with a heavy debt, the country is speculating on its\r\nfuture and living on its capital. For the next few years it will in all\r\nlikelihood achieve solvency; but the margin may be small, and the result\r\nmay be secured only by the retention of certain revenue-producing\r\ncharges at an unnatural figure. A considerable part of the debt will be\r\napplied to services which will make a good return in time, but for a\r\nlittle while revenue may barely cover disbursements. In finance, above\r\nall other provinces, there is need of a severe economy, coupled with a\r\nclear recognition of the country's needs and a judicious courage. It is\r\na gamble, if you like, but with sleepless and ubiquitous watchfulness\r\nthe odds are greatly in our favour. The very forces which fight against\r\nus, the complexity of economic and social interests, will become our\r\nservants, if properly understood, and will solidify and preserve our\r\nwork, as the house fashioned of granite will stand when the building of\r\nsandstone will crumble. The shaping force of intelligence remains the\r\none thing needful. Of high and just intentions there can be little\r\ndoubt, but in the new South Africa we are more likely to be perplexed by\r\nthe fool than the knave. Will the result, as Cromwell asked long ago, be\r\n\"answerable to the simplicity and honesty of the design\"? Neither to the\r\none nor the other, but to that rarer endowment, political wisdom.\r\n\r\nSo much for administrative problems. A country whose future is staked\r\nupon the intelligence of its Government and its people is an\r\nexhilarating spectacle to the better type of man. England has\r\nsucceeded before on the same postulates and in harder circumstances.\r\nBut there are certain subtler aspects of development, where the same\r\nhigh qualities are necessary, but where the end to be striven for is\r\nless clear. There is the fusion of the two races, an ideal if not a\r\npractical necessity. As has been said, a political union already\r\nexists after a fashion. There seems little reason to fear any future\r\ndisruption, for on the material side Dutch interests are ours, and all\r\nare vitally concerned in the common prosperity. Administrative\r\nefficiency will make the Boer acquiesce in any form of government. But\r\nthat which Lord Durham thought far more formidable, \"a struggle not of\r\nprinciples but of races,\" may continue for long in other departments\r\nthan politics, unless we use extraordinary caution in our methods. The\r\nvery advance of civilisation may militate against us by vivifying\r\nhistorical memories and rekindling a clearer flame of racial\r\nresentment. The Dutch have their own ideals, different from ours, but\r\nnot incompatible with complete political union. Any attempt to do\r\nviolence to their ideals, or any hasty and unconsidered imposition of\r\nunsuitable English forms, will throw back that work of spiritual\r\nincorporation which is the highest destiny of the country. They have a\r\nstrong Church and a strong creed, certain educational ideas and social\r\ninstitutions which must long remain powers in the land. And let us\r\nremember that any South African civilisation must grow up on the soil,\r\nand must borrow much from the Dutch race, else it is no true growth\r\nbut a frail exotic. It will borrow English principles but not English\r\ninstitutions, since, while principles are grafts from human needs,\r\ninstitutions are the incrusted mosses of time which do not bear\r\ntransplanting. It is idle to talk of universities such as Oxford, or\r\npublic schools like Winchester, and any attempt to tend such alien\r\nplants will be a waste of money and time. South Africa will create her\r\nown nurseries, and on very different lines. If we are burdened in our\r\nwork with false parallels we shall fail, for nothing in the new\r\ncountry can survive which is not based on a clear-sighted survey of\r\nthings as they are, and a renunciation of old formulas. Let us\r\nrecognise that we cannot fuse the races by destroying the sacred\r\nplaces of one of them, but only by giving to the future generations\r\nsome common heritage. \"If you unscotch us,\" wrote Sir Walter Scott to\r\nCroker, \"you will find us damned mischievous Englishmen,\" and it will\r\nbe a very mischievous Dutchman who is coerced into unsuitable English\r\nways and taught sentiments of which he has no understanding. When a\r\npeople arise who have a common culture bequeathed from their fathers,\r\nand who look back upon Ladysmith and Colenso, the Great Trek and the\r\nPeninsular War, as incidents in a common pedigree, then we shall have\r\nfusion indeed, a union in spirit and in truth. Nothing which has in it\r\nthe stuff of life can ever die, and there is something of this\r\nvitality in the Dutch tradition. Our own is stronger, wider, resting\r\non greater historical foundations, and therefore it will more readily\r\nattract and absorb the lesser. But the lesser will live, transformed,\r\nindeed, but none the less a real part of the spiritual heritage of a\r\nnation where there will be no racial cleavage. The consummation is not\r\nyet, and, maybe, will be long delayed. It will not be in our time;\r\nperhaps our sons may see it; certainly, I think, our grandchildren\r\nwill be very near it. Such a development cannot be artificially\r\nhastened, and all that we can do is to see that no barriers of our own\r\nmaking are allowed to intervene. Meantime we have a _de facto_\r\npolitical union to make the most of.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of men are the citizens of this new nation to be? They\r\nwill have the vigour which belongs to colonial parentage, the\r\nfreshness of outlook and freedom from old shibboleths. But they\r\nshould have more. They start as no colony has ever started, with the\r\nechoes of a great war still in their ears, with a highly developed\r\nindustry and the chances of great wealth, and with a population\r\nshowing as high a level of intelligence as any in the world. The\r\nnature of their problem will compel them to remain intellectually\r\nactive, and as the eyes of the world are on them they will have few\r\ntemptations to lethargy. They may take foolish steps and be beguiled\r\ninto rash experiments, but I do not think they will stagnate. And for\r\nthis people so much alive there is the chance of an indigenous\r\nculture, born of the old, when they have leisure to make it theirs,\r\nand the freshening influences of their new land and their strenuous\r\nlife. South Africa cannot help herself. She must play a large part in\r\nimperial politics; her views on economic questions will be listened to\r\nby all the world; a political future, good or bad, she must accept and\r\nmake the most of. But behind it all there is the prospect of that\r\nintimate self-development, that progress in thought, in the arts, in\r\nthe amenities of life, which, like righteousness, exalteth a nation.\r\nThe finest of all experiments is to unite an older civilisation with\r\nthe natural freshness of a virgin soil, and she, alone among the\r\ncolonies which have ever been founded, has the power to make it. Not\r\nonly is it a new land, but it is Africa, a corner of that mysterious\r\ncontinent to which the eyes of dreamers and adventurers have always\r\nturned. The boundaries of the unknown are shrinking daily, and where\r\nour forefathers marked only lions and behemoths on the map, we set\r\ndown a hundred names and a dozen trading stations. The winds which\r\nblow from the hills of the north tell no longer of mystic interior\r\nkingdoms and uncounted treasures. We know most things nowadays, and\r\nhave given our knowledge the prosaic form of joint-stock companies.\r\nBut the proverb still justifies itself.[43] Africa is still a home of\r\nthe incalculable, not wholly explored or explorable, still a\r\nhinterland to which the youth of the south can push forward in search\r\nof fortune, and from which that breath of romance, which is the life\r\nof the English race, can inspire thinkers and song-makers. Girdled on\r\nthree sides by the ocean, and on the fourth looking north to the\r\ninland seas and the eternal snows of Ruwenzori--I can imagine no\r\nnobler cradle for a race. I have said that a structure built with\r\ndifficulty is the most lasting. Her complex problems will knit\r\ntogether the sinews of intelligence and national character, and the\r\ngreat commonplaces of policy, so eternally true, so inexorable in\r\ntheir application, will become part of her creed, not from lip-service\r\nbut from the sweat and toil of practical work. If to these she can add\r\nother commonplaces, still older and more abiding, of civic duty, of\r\nthe intellectual life, of moral purpose, she will present to history\r\nthat most rare and formidable of combinations, intellect and vitality,\r\nwill and reason, culture guiding and inspiring an unhesitating gift\r\nfor action.\r\n\r\nThere is already a school of political thought in South Africa, a\r\nsmall school, and thus far so ill-defined that it has no common\r\nprogramme to put before a world which barely recognises its existence.\r\nIt owes its inspiration to Mr Rhodes, but its founder left it no\r\nlegacy of doctrine beyond a certain instinct for great things, a fire\r\nof imagination, and a brooding energy. Its members are very practical\r\nmen, landowners, mine-owners, rich, capable, with nothing of the\r\nideologue in their air, the last people one would naturally go to for\r\nambitions which could not be easily reduced to pounds sterling. But\r\nthey are of the school: at heart they are pioneers, the cyclopean\r\narchitects of new lands. It is one of South Africa's paradoxes that\r\nthere should exist among successful and matter-of-fact men of business\r\na hungry fidelity to ideals for which we look in vain among the\r\ndoctrinaires who do them facile homage. And they are also very\r\npractical in their aims. Mr Rhodes never desired a paper empire or\r\nthat vague thing called territorial prestige. What filled his\r\nimagination was the thought of new nations of our blood living a free\r\nand wholesome life and turning the wilderness into a habitable place.\r\nHe strove not for profit but for citizens, for a breathing-space, a\r\nplayground, for the future. The faults of his methods and the\r\nimperfections of his aims, which are so curiously our own English\r\nfaults and imperfections, may have hindered the realisation of his\r\ndreams, but they did not impair that legacy of daimonic force which he\r\nleft to his countrymen. You may find it in South Africa to-day, and if\r\nyou rightly understand it and feel its hidden movements you will be\r\naghast at your own parochialism. It is slow and patient, knowing that\r\n\"the counsels to which Time hath not been called Time will not\r\nratify.\" But with Time on its side it is confident, and it will not\r\neasily be thwarted.\r\n\r\nExcursions in colonial psychology are rarely illuminating, lacking as\r\na rule both sympathy and knowledge; but on one trait there is a\r\nsingular unanimity. The two chief obstacles to imperial unity, so runs\r\na saying, are the bumptious colonial and the supercilious Englishman.\r\nI readily grant the latter, but is the first fairly described? A\r\ncolonist is naturally prone to self-assertion in certain walks of\r\nlife. If he creates an industry alone and from the start in the teeth\r\nof hardships, having had to begin from the very beginning, he is apt\r\nto lose perspective and unduly magnify his work. If he owns a bakery,\r\nit is the finest in the world, at any rate in the British Empire. He\r\ncompares his doings with his neighbours' within his limited horizon,\r\nand he is scarcely to be blamed if he brags a little. His bravado is\r\nonly ridiculous when taken out of its surroundings, and at the worst\r\nis more a mannerism than an affection of mind. But on the intellectual\r\nside he is, in my judgment, conspicuously humble, a groper after the\r\nviewless things whose omnipotence he feels dimly. To the home-bred man\r\nhistory is a commonplace to be taken for granted; to the colonist who\r\nhas shaped a workaday life from the wilds, it is a vast mother of\r\nmystery. Traditions, customs, standards staled to us by the vain\r\nemphasis of generations, rise before him as revelations and shrines of\r\nimmortal wisdom. What to us is rhetoric is to him the finest poetry;\r\nand for this reason in politics he is prone to follow imaginative\r\nschemes, without testing them by his native caution. Our somewhat\r\nweary intellectual world is a temple which he is ready to approach\r\nwith uncovered head. It is not mere innocence, but rather, I think,\r\nthat freshness of outlook and optimism which he gathers from his new\r\nland and his contact with the beginnings of things. Truth and beauty\r\nremain the same: it is only the symbols and the mirrors which grow\r\ndim with time; and to the man who is sufficiently near to understand\r\nthe symbols, and sufficiently aloof to see no flaw or tawdriness,\r\nthere is a double share of happiness. The superficial assurance, the\r\n\"bumptiousness\" of the saying, is surely a small matter if behind it\r\nthere is this true modesty of spirit.\r\n\r\nA national life presumes union, but South African federation is simply\r\na step to a larger goal. It may be objected that in the foregoing\r\nchapters the cardinal problem is treated as less the fusion of the two\r\nraces than the development of South Africa on certain lines within our\r\ncolonial system. Such has been the intention of the book. The Dutch\r\nhave accepted the new _regime_; they will fight, if they fight, on\r\nconstitutional lines under our aegis and within our Empire, and in a\r\nsense it may be said that racial union on the political side already\r\nexists. But the further political development of the country, as\r\nself-consciousness is slowly gained--that, indeed, is a matter on\r\nwhich hang great issues, good or bad, for the English people. Because\r\nthe furnace has been so hot, the metal will emerge pure or it will not\r\nemerge at all. A new colony, or rather a new nation, will have been\r\ncreated, or another will have been added to the catalogue of our\r\ninfrequent failures, and the loose territorial mass known as South\r\nAfrica will become the prey of any wandering demagogue or aspiring\r\nforeign Power. Our late opponents will take their revenge, if they\r\nseek it, not by reviving the impossible creed of Dutch supremacy, but\r\nby retarding South Africa from what is her highest destiny and her\r\nworthiest line of development. Her future, if she will accept it, is\r\nto be a pioneer in imperial federation: a pioneer, because she has\r\nfelt more than any other colony the evils of disintegration, the vices\r\nof the old colonial system, the insecurity of government from above,\r\nand at the same time is in a position to realise the weakness of that\r\nindependence which is also isolation. This is not the place to enter\r\nupon so vast a question. To many it is the greatest of modern\r\npolitical dreams. Without it imperialism becomes empty rhetoric and\r\nbraggadocio, a tissue of dessicated phrases, worthy of the worst\r\naccusations with which its enemies have assailed it. Without it our\r\nEmpire is neither secure from aggression nor politically sound nor\r\ncommercially solvent. Within it alone can any true scheme of common\r\ndefence be realised. Moreover, it is the glamour needed to give to\r\ncolonial politics that wider imaginative outlook which England enjoys\r\nin virtue of a long descent. Colonial politics tend to become at times\r\nnarrow and provincial; in a federation they would gain that larger\r\nview and ampler pride which a man feels who, believing himself to be\r\nhumbly born, learns for the first time that he is the scion of a\r\nfamous house. Their kinship, instead of the long-remembered sentiment\r\nof a descendant, would become the intimate loyalty of a colleague. And\r\nhome politics also would lose the provincialism, equally vicious, if\r\nhistorically more interesting, which lies somewhere near the root of\r\nour gravest errors, and in relinquishing a facile imperialism find an\r\nempire which needs no rhetoric to enhance its splendour.\r\n\r\nBut before South Africa can become an ally in federation she must\r\nmake her peace with herself. If it is difficult to exaggerate the\r\nneed for untiring intelligence in the making of this peace, it is\r\neven harder to over-estimate the profound significance which her\r\nsuccess or failure in the task of self-realisation has for the\r\nprestige of our race. Our colonial methods are on trial in a sphere\r\nwhere all the world can watch. And while our aim is a colony, the\r\nmeans must be different from those which we have hitherto used in our\r\nexpansion. A nascent colony was neglected till it asserted itself and\r\nappeared already mature on the political horizon. But in the growth\r\nof this colony England must play a direct part, since for good or for\r\nill her destinies are linked with it, and supineness and a foolish\r\ninterference will equally bring disaster. There is one parallel, not\r\nindeed in political conditions, but in the qualities required for the\r\nshaping of the country. If we can show in South Africa that spirit of\r\nsleepless intelligence which has created British India, then there is\r\nnothing to fear. For, as I understand history, India was made by\r\nEnglishmen who brought to the task three qualities above others. The\r\nfirst was a wide toleration for local customs and religions--a desire\r\nto leave the national life intact, and to mould it slowly by those\r\nforces of enlightenment in which sincerely, if undogmatically, they\r\nbelieved. The second was the extension of rigorous justice and full\r\ncivil rights to every subject, a policy which in the long-run is the\r\nonly means of bringing a subject race into the life of the State.\r\nLast, and most vital of all, they showed in their work a complete\r\nefficiency, proving themselves better statesmen, financiers, jurists,\r\nsoldiers, than any class they had superseded. This efficiency is the\r\nkey-note of the South African problem, so far as concerns British\r\ninterests. If the imperial Power shows itself inspired with energy,\r\nacumen, a clear-eyed perception of truth as well as with its\r\ntraditional honesty of purpose, South Africa will gladly follow where\r\nit may lead. But she will be quick to criticise formalism and\r\nintolerant of a fumbling incapacity.\r\n\r\n_Sed nondum est finis._ We stand at the beginning of a new path, and\r\nit is impossible to tell whither it may lead, what dark fords and\r\nstony places it may pass through, and in what sandy desert or green\r\nchampaign it may end. Political prophecy is an idle occupation.\r\nAmerican observers on the eve of the French Revolution saw England on\r\nthe verge of anarchy and France a contented country under a beloved\r\nking. Even so acute a writer as de Tocqueville assumed that America\r\nwould continue an agricultural country without manufactures, and that\r\nthe fortunes of her citizens would be small. If philosophers may err,\r\nit is well for a humble writer to be modest in his conclusions. In\r\nthe past pages an effort has been made neither to minimise the\r\ndifficulties nor to over-estimate the chances of South African\r\nprosperity. \"Whosoever,\" said Ralegh, \"in writing a modern history\r\nshall follow truth too near the heels, it may haply strike out his\r\nteeth.\" I can ask for no better fate than to see all my forecasts\r\nfalsified, the dangers proved to have no existence, the chances shown\r\na thousandfold more roseate. But whatever may be the destiny of this\r\nor that observation, there can be no dispute, I think, upon the\r\ngravity of the problem and the profound importance of its wise\r\nsettlement. And when all is said that can be said it is permissible\r\nto import into our view a little of that ancestral optimism which has\r\nhitherto kept our hearts high in our checkered history, for optimism,\r\nwhen buttressed by intelligence, is but another name for courage.\r\nThere is an optimism more merciless than any pessimism, which, seeing\r\nclearly all the perils and discouragements, the hollowness of smooth\r\nconventional counsels and the dreary list of past errors, can yet\r\npluck up heart to believe that there is no work too hard for the\r\nEnglish race when its purpose is firm and its intelligence awakened.\r\nWith this belief we may well look forward to a day when the old\r\nunhappy things will have become far off and forgotten, and South\r\nAfrica, at peace with herself, will be the leader in a new and\r\npregnant imperial policy; and the words of the poet of another empire\r\nwill be true in a nobler and ampler sense of ours, \"They who drink\r\nof the Rhone and the Orontes are all one nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  [43]  \"Out of Africa comes ever some new thing\" is generally\r\n        quoted in the Latin of Pliny, but it is probably as old\r\n        as the first Ionian adventurers who sailed to Egypt or\r\n        heard wild Phoenician tales. It is found in Aristotle:\r\n        ~Legetai tis paroimia hoti aei pherei Libye ti kainon~\r\n        (Hist.
