M.A., F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew historical documents are more interesting or important than\r\nthe contemporary songs in which the political partizan satirised\r\nhis opponents and stirred up the courage of his friends, or in\r\nwhich the people exulted over victories gained abroad against their\r\nenemies or at home against their oppressors, or lamented over evil\r\ncounsels and national calamities. Yet, though a few specimens have\r\nbeen published from time to time in collections of miscellaneous\r\npoetry, such as those of Percy and Ritson, and have never failed to\r\nattract attention, no book specially devoted to ancient Political\r\nSongs has yet appeared.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of such productions has generally varied with the\r\ncharacter of the age. They were frequent from a very early period\r\nin other countries of Europe, as well as England. It would be\r\neasy to produce proofs that in our island they were very numerous\r\nin Saxon times,--a few specimens, indeed, have escaped that\r\ndestruction which visits the monuments of popular and temporary\r\nfeeling before all others; and for years after the Norman conquest\r\nthe oppressed people continued to sing the songs of former days\r\nat their rustic festivals or amid their everyday labours. As the\r\nfeelings which caused them to be remembered died away gradually\r\nbefore the weight of a new political system, a new class of songs\r\nalso arose. From the Conquest to the end of the twelfth century,\r\nthe political songs of the Anglo-Normans were in a great measure\r\nconfined, as far as we can judge from the few specimens that are\r\nleft, to laudatory poems in Latin, or to funereal elegies on\r\nprinces and great people. Yet we can hardly doubt that, with the\r\nturbulent barons of these troublous times, the harp of the minstrel\r\nmust have resounded frequently to subjects of greater present\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the thirteenth century opened a new scene\r\nof political contention. It is amid the civil commotions of the\r\nreign of John, that our manuscripts first present traces of the\r\nsongs in which popular opinion sought and found a vent, at the same\r\ntime that the commons of England began to assume a more active\r\npart on the stage of history. The following reign was a period\r\nof constant excitement. The weak government of Henry the Third\r\npermitted every party to give free utterance to their opinions and\r\nintentions, and the songs of this period are remarkably bold and\r\npointed. These effusions are interesting in other points of view\r\nbesides their connexion with historical events; they illustrate in\r\na remarkable manner the history of our language; they show us how\r\nLatin, Anglo-Norman, and English were successively the favourite\r\ninstruments by which the thoughts of our ancestors were expressed;\r\nand collaterally they show us how the clerk (or scholar) with his\r\nLatin, the courtier with his Anglo-Norman, and the people with\r\ntheir good old English, came forward in turns upon the scene. In\r\nour Songs we see that, during the earlier part of the reign of\r\nthe third Henry, the satirical pieces which inveighed against the\r\ncorruptions of the state and demanded so loudly their amendment,\r\nare all in Latin, which is as much as to say that they came from\r\nthe scholastic part of the people, or those who had been bred\r\nin the universities, then no small or unimportant part of the\r\ncommunity. They seem to have led the way as bold reformers; and the\r\nrefectory of the monastery not less than the baronial hall rang\r\nfrequently with the outbursts of popular feeling. The remarkable\r\nand highly interesting declaration of the objects and sentiments\r\nof the Barons, which was published after the battle of Lewes, is\r\nwritten in Latin. Amid the Barons’ wars was composed the first\r\npolitical song in English that has yet been found. It is remarkable\r\nthat all the songs of this period which we know, whether in\r\nLatin, Anglo-Norman, or English, are on the popular side of the\r\ndispute--all with one accord agree in their praise and support of\r\nthe great Simon de Montfort.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance of our finding no songs in English of an earlier\r\ndate does not, however, prove that they did not exist. On the\r\ncontrary, it is probable that they were equally abundant with the\r\nothers; but the Latin songs belonged to that particular party\r\nwho were most in the habit of committing their productions to\r\nwriting, and whose manuscripts also were longest preserved. It\r\nis probable that a very small portion of the earlier English\r\npopular poetry was ever entered in books--it was preserved in\r\npeople’s memory until, gradually forgotten, it ceased entirely to\r\nexist except in a few instances, where, years after the period\r\nat which it was first composed, it was committed to writing by\r\nthose who heard it recited. The English song on the battle of\r\nLewes is found in a manuscript written in the reign of Edward\r\nII.; when, perhaps, the similar character of the time led people\r\nto give retrospective looks to the doings of Earl Simon and his\r\nconfederate barons. They were sometimes written on small rolls of\r\nparchment, for the convenience of the minstrel, who thus carried\r\nthem about with him from house to house, and chanted them at the\r\nwill of his entertainers. From these rolls and loose scraps they\r\nwere occasionally copied into books, long after they had ceased to\r\npossess any popular interest, by some “clerk” who loved to collect\r\nantiquities; for in those days, too, there were antiquaries. One\r\nof the Anglo-Norman songs printed in this collection is taken\r\nfrom the original roll; and the Latin songs on the death of Peter\r\nde Gaveston were found in a manuscript written in the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe constant wars of the reign of Edward I.--the patriotic hatred\r\nof Frenchman and Scot, which then ran at the highest--furnished\r\nthe groundwork of many a national song during the latter years of\r\nthe thirteenth century and the first years of the fourteenth. The\r\nEnglish song becomes at this period much more frequent, though\r\nmany were still written in Latin. Popular discontent continued\r\nto be expressed equally in Latin, Anglo-Norman (a language the\r\ninfluence of which was now fast declining), and English. In the\r\n“Song against the King’s Taxes,” composed towards the end of the\r\nthirteenth century, we have the first specimen of that kind of\r\nsong wherein each line began in one language and ended in another;\r\nand which, generally written in hexameters, seems to have been\r\nextremely popular during the two centuries following. One song, in\r\nthe reign of Edward II. presents in alternate succession all the\r\nthree languages which were then in use. The political songs during\r\nthis last-mentioned reign are not very numerous, but they are by no\r\nmeans devoid of interest.\r\n\r\nIt was the Editor’s original intention to continue the series of\r\nsongs in the present volume to the deposition of Richard II. But,\r\nhaving adopted the suggestion of giving a translation, with the\r\nhope of making them more popular, and finding that in consequence\r\nthe volume was likely to extend to a much greater length than\r\nwas at first calculated upon, it has been thought advisable to\r\nclose the present collection with another convenient historical\r\nperiod, the deposition of his grandfather Edward II.; and it is his\r\nintention at some future period to form a second volume, which will\r\nbe continued to the fall of the house of York in the person of the\r\ncrook-backed Richard III.\r\n\r\nThe wars of Edward III. produced many songs, both in Latin and in\r\nEnglish, as did also the troubles which disturbed the reign of\r\nhis successor. With the end of the reign of Edward II. however,\r\nwe begin to lose sight of the Anglo-Norman language, which we\r\nshall not again meet with in these popular effusions. During the\r\nfifteenth century political songs are less numerous and also less\r\nspirited. With it we are introduced to a dark period of literature\r\nand science. It was the interval between the breaking up of the old\r\nsystem, and the formation of the new one which was to be built upon\r\nits ruins. When we come to the wars of the Roses, so fatal to the\r\nEnglish nobility and gentry, the page even of history becomes less\r\ninteresting, because it is less intellectual:--the great mental\r\nworkings which had influenced so much the political movements of\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, were replaced by the\r\nreckless and short-sighted bitterness of personal hatred, and the\r\ndemoralizing agency of mere animal force. As it had required a\r\nlong age of barbarism and ignorance to sweep away even the latest\r\nremnants of ancient pagan splendour, before the site was fit to\r\nbuild up the beautiful edifice of Christian civilization; so it\r\nseemed as though another, though a shorter and comparatively less\r\nprofound, age of barbarism was required to turn men’s minds from\r\nthe defective learning of the schools, and the imperfect literature\r\nto which they had been habituated, and to break down old prejudices\r\nand privileges, which were but impediments in the way of the new\r\nsystem that came in with the Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the following collection of Songs requires little\r\nexplanation. They have been brought together from scattered\r\nsources. It was the Editor’s desire to make it as complete as\r\npossible; but further researches will probably bring to light other\r\nsongs of no less interest, and these, if they become sufficiently\r\nnumerous, he hopes will be collected together as a supplement to\r\nthe present volume. He has also omitted a few Anglo-Irish songs,\r\nbecause he expects they will, ere long, receive more justice\r\nthan he is capable of doing them, at the hands of Mr. Crofton\r\nCroker. It is hoped that the texts will be found as correct as\r\nthe manuscripts would allow. The translation is offered with\r\ndiffidence, and requires many excuses; the variety of languages\r\nand dialects in which they are written, their dissimilarity in\r\nstyle of composition, the cramped constructions which were rendered\r\nnecessary in the Latin Songs to allow the multiplicity of rhymes,\r\nthe allusions which cannot now be easily explained, and above all,\r\nthe numerous corruptions which have been introduced by the scribes\r\nfrom whose hands the different manuscripts came (for the greater\r\npart of these songs have been printed from unique copies), are\r\nthe cause of so many difficulties, that in some instances little\r\nmore has been done than to guess at the writer’s meaning. The\r\ntranslation is in general as literal as possible--the Anglo-Norman,\r\nFrench, and English Songs are rendered line for line; but the\r\nEditor is almost inclined to regret that he did not give a freer\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nThe Appendix consists of extracts from the inedited metrical\r\nchronicle of Peter Langtoft, which are here introduced, because\r\nthey contain fragments in what was then termed “_ryme cowée_,” or\r\ntailed rhyme, which are apparently taken from songs of the time.\r\nThe text is printed from a transcript made by the Editor several\r\nyears ago; and it contains many lines of the English songs which\r\nare not found in the manuscripts preserved at the British Museum.\r\nThe Editor introduces these extracts the more willingly, as it is\r\nnot very probable that the Chronicle itself will be published at\r\npresent. As a monument of the Anglo-Norman language, it is far\r\ninferior to many others that remain still inedited; and, as a\r\nhistorical document, it is already well known through the English\r\nversion of Robert de Brunne, which was printed by Thomas Hearne.\r\nThe collations have been made chiefly with a philological view; the\r\ncomparison of the different manuscripts shows us how entirely the\r\ngrammatical forms of the Anglo-Norman language were at this time\r\nneglected. To these extracts, the Editor has been enabled to add\r\na very curious English poem from the Auchinleck MS. at Edinburgh,\r\nby the extreme kindness of David Laing, Esq., to whom the Camden\r\nSociety owes the transcript and collation of the proofs of this\r\npoem.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the Editor to fulfil the agreeable task of\r\nexpressing his gratitude for the assistance which, in the course\r\nof the work, he has derived from the kindness of his friends:\r\nto Mons. d’Avezac, of Paris, so well known by his valuable\r\ncontributions to geographical science, to whom he has had recourse\r\nin some of the greater difficulties in the French and Anglo-Norman\r\nsongs, and who collated with the originals those which were taken\r\nfrom foreign manuscripts before they were sent to press; to Sir\r\nFrederick Madden, from whom he has derived much assistance in\r\nthe English songs, and whose superior knowledge in everything\r\nconnected with early literature and manuscripts has been of the\r\ngreatest use to him; to James Orchard Halliwell, Esq., for many\r\nservices, and for collating with the originals the songs taken from\r\nCambridge Manuscripts; and to John Gough Nichols, Esq., for the\r\ngreat attention which he has paid to the proofs, and for various\r\nsuggestions, which have freed this volume from very many errors\r\nthat would otherwise have been overlooked.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        REIGN OF KING JOHN.

Early in his reign the English Monarch\r\nsuffered himself to be robbed of his possessions in Normandy, and\r\nthe poetry of the Troubadours contains many expressions of regret\r\nat their separation from England, and bitter reflections on the\r\nKing’s cowardice and weakness. The following song seems to have\r\nbeen written when Thouars was in danger, during Philippe Auguste’s\r\nincursions into Poitou, in 1206. Savary of Mauleon is famous in\r\ncontemporary history, and was himself a poet of no small renown. He\r\nwas a firm adherent to the English party.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG ON THE SIEGE OF THOUARS.\r\n\r\n[Royal Library at Paris, MS. du fonds de St. Germain, No. 1989,\r\nfol. 111, v^o. 13th cent.]\r\n\r\n        Mors est li siècles briemant,\r\n      Se li rois Touwairs sormonte;\r\n        De ceu li vait malement\r\n      Ke li faillent li troi conte,\r\n        Et li vieillairs de Bouaing\r\n      I averait grant honte,\r\n      C’après la mort à vifconte\r\n        Morrait à si mauté.\r\n\r\n        Savaris de Maliéon,\r\n      Boens chiveliers à cintainne,\r\n        Se vos fals à ces besons,\r\n      Perdue avons nostre poinne;\r\n        Et vos, xanexals\r\n      Asi d’Anjow et dou Mainne,\r\n      Xanexal ont an Torainne\r\n        Atre ke vos mist.\r\n\r\n        Et vos, sire xanexals,\r\n      Vos et Dan Jehan dou Mainne,\r\n        Et Ugues, antre vos trois\r\n      Mandeis à roi d’Alemaigne,\r\n        Ke cist rois et cil Fransois\r\n      C’ameir ne nos d[a]ignent,\r\n      Cant por .j. mulet d’Espaigne\r\n        Laxait Bordelois.\r\n\r\n        Et vos, signors bacheleirs,\r\n      Ki ameis lois et proeses,\r\n        Cant vos souliez garreir\r\n      Touwairs iert vos forteresce.\r\n        Jà Deus ne vos doust porteir\r\n      Ne mainche ne treses,\r\n      Se Touwairt au teil tristesce\r\n        Laixiez oblieir.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--The world will shortly come to nought,--if the king\r\n  overcome Thouars.--On this account it fares ill with it,--that\r\n  the three earls desert it,--and the old man of Bouaing--would\r\n  have there great shame,--that after the death of the viscount--he\r\n  should die in such evil case.\r\n\r\n  Savary of Mauleon,--a good knight at the quintain,--if you\r\n  fail us in this need,--we have lost our labour;--and you,\r\n  Seneschal,--both of Anjou and of Maine,--they have placed a\r\n  seneschal in Touraine--other than you.\r\n\r\n  And you, Sir Seneschal,--you and Sir John of Maine,--and Hugh,\r\n  between you three,--send word to the King of Almain,--that this\r\n  king and him of France,--deign not to love us,--when for a mule\r\n  of Spain--he left the Bordelois.\r\n\r\n  And you, Sir bachelors,--who love praise and prowess,--when you\r\n  were wont to war--Thouars was your fortress.--Now God hinder\r\n  you from bearing--sleeves or tresses,--if Thouars in such\r\n  distress--you allow to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJohn’s own friends, disgusted with his weakness, began to desert\r\nhim;

But thou hast another Thomas; thou hast again a\r\n  second Stephen, who putting on a fortitude beyond that of man,\r\n  performs signs among the people. O metropolis! who grievest over\r\n  the plots which the cunning people bring forth, bereaved of thine\r\n  inhabitants, whom they treacherously have ejected, thou givest\r\n  vent to heavy groans, being utterly deprived of thy father. But\r\n  when thou shalt have Stephen, thou wilt take up the timbrel, and\r\n  touch the harp to measure.\r\n\r\n  Where art thou, I ask, O Moses! through whom may the rupture\r\n  cease? Where Phineas, zealous for the law, through whom the\r\n  scourging may have an end? Who is there to accuse the son\r\n  of David? Who is there that may set the sign of Thau on the\r\n  threshold and the door-posts, that thus, her enemies being\r\n  confused, Israel may be liberated? Abraham, father of many\r\n  people, arise, lord, expel the son of Agar, the waiting-maid of\r\n  her mistress Sarah; for after she shall deceive the other. Now\r\n  the gates of Tartarus prevail against the Church: now Isaac and\r\n  Ismael play at an unequal game.\r\n\r\n  Balthasar drinks again out of the vessels of the Lord’s temple:\r\n  the vessel of iniquities carries away the vessels dedicated\r\n  to God’s name. I perceive the hand, writing, and involved in\r\n  the written letters, “Mane, Techel, Phares;” what this thing\r\n  may mean, the event of the thing will prove. Now it appears in\r\n  the court, both to the low and the high, that at present the\r\n  division and end of the kingdom is at the gate. The mass of evils\r\n  increases; the priest is as the people; they, bold and fearless,\r\n  hasten to that which is unlawful, each according to his will.\r\n\r\n  The people serves in the coffer of Egypt, and anxiously sweats\r\n  under the rule of Pharaoh: various edicts fly about: the\r\n  collector exacts the work, Israel collects clay. There is no one\r\n  who may rescue him, or who may overwhelm the horses of Pharaoh\r\n  with their riders. Assur scatters and overthrows the stones of\r\n  the Sanctuary. Why? because the Stone of Help does not oppose\r\n  itself. Nay, they who ought to oppose, and to shed their blood\r\n  for justice’s sake, are occupied with avarice, whom I signalise\r\n  by these marks.\r\n\r\n  If the question were perchance asked of the bishop of Bath,\r\n  “How many marks come in to the King’s purse in the Exchequer?”\r\n  he would answer readily, “A thousand, a hundred, and so on,\r\n  I collect into the King’s purse,” learned as he is in this\r\n  decalogue, blind in the form of the canon. Thou, beast of\r\n  Norwich! hear what the Truth saith: “He who enters not by the\r\n  door is a thief.” Dost thou doubt of this? Alas! thou hast\r\n  fallen more heavily than once the third Cato, since thy presumed\r\n  election falls by just judgment, having been bought by the craft\r\n  of Simon.\r\n\r\n  The arm-bearer of Winchester presides at the Exchequer, diligent\r\n  in computing, sluggish at the Gospel, turning over the King’s\r\n  roll; thus lucre overcomes Luke; he makes a marc weigh heavier\r\n  than Mark, and subjects the bible to the scales. These are they\r\n  who fore-show Belphegor; they subject the seat to Baal; that\r\n  they may profit better, they make Baal their lord; they embrace\r\n  black for white, dung instead of saffron. These three are\r\n  insatiable--very like unto leeches; they cry, “Give! there is not\r\n  enough!”\r\n\r\n  There are three opposed to these, but very unlike them,\r\n  endowed with the flower of virtues, noble in the vigour of\r\n  good-breeding--Noah, David, and Daniel, whom Ezechiel paints.\r\n  These thirst after justice; for this they oppose themselves\r\n  as a wall for God’s house. John arises the dean of England of\r\n  our time, hoary in mind: with the might of oak, he proceeds\r\n  on the way of justice; he sings the proclamations of praises,\r\n  who rightly takes his name from the church of Mary, while he\r\n  undertakes this conflict in devotion to the Holy Virgin.\r\n\r\n  He of Ely advances; he is given to this battle, as he is called\r\n  the Sword of Hely, sparing few or none. Helias, draw forth the\r\n  sword, and bruise the three impious ones, and lay prostrate the\r\n  prince of Babylon, the participater in this plot, with a single\r\n  blow. Thou, who walkest in the place of Wolstan, art the third in\r\n  the conflict: robust as thou art, press on sedulously, certain of\r\n  a true triumph. Thou art called the heir of Wolstan; if thou be\r\n  truly so, thou art seen: sooner resign the staff, and the ephod,\r\n  and the ring, than be willing to bow to Baal.\r\n\r\n  I know nothing ill to say of the bishop of Rochester. I lie,\r\n  and cut the matter short; he is here, and here by his side the\r\n  poor man of Salisbury also, who sleeps till to-day; he carries\r\n  about fire and water, nor pleads for, nor bewails, the desolated\r\n  vineyard. Go to Rome, little book, nor delay thy return; salute\r\n  them all diligently; and carry a salutation to the Pope: tell\r\n  what I think of the three: let him give judgment, whether in his\r\n  opinion they be free from vice; and let pardon be granted to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was during these religious dissensions that arose up, or at\r\nleast became strong, that powerful spirit of opposition to the\r\npapal tyranny, which produced during the whole of this century so\r\nmuch satirical poetry; much of it attributed, perhaps with little\r\nreason, to Walter Mapes. The following song is supposed to have\r\nbeen written during the interdict.

There are offered for sale the rights of the\r\n  senators, and abundance of money dissolves all differences of\r\n  opinion.--Here, in the consistory, if any body plead a cause, be\r\n  it his own or another’s, let him first read this,--“Unless he\r\n  give money, Rome denies every thing; he who gives most money will\r\n  come off the best.”--The Romans have a chapter in the decretals,\r\n  that they should listen to petitions from those who come with\r\n  their hands full; thou shalt give, or nothing shall be granted\r\n  thee; they ask because thou askest; by the same measure as you\r\n  sow, you shall reap.--A bribe and a petition go side by side, and\r\n  it is with a bribe that you must work if you wish to succeed:\r\n  then you need have no fear, even of Tully, were he pleading\r\n  against you; for money possesses a singular eloquence.--There is\r\n  nobody in this court who does not look after money: the cross on\r\n  the coin pleases them; the roundness of it, and the whiteness\r\n  thereof, pleases them; and since every part of it pleases, and\r\n  it is the Romans whom it pleases, where money speaks, there all\r\n  law is silent.--If you only feed the hand well with some goodly\r\n  bribe, it will be in vain even to quote Justinian against you,\r\n  or the canons of the saints, because they would throw them away\r\n  as vanity and chaff, and pocket the grain.--Penurious Rome\r\n  claims acquaintance with nothing but avarice; she spares to him\r\n  who brings gifts, but she spares not to him who is penurious:\r\n  money stands in the place of God, and a marc for Mark, and the\r\n  altar is less attended than the coffer.--When you come to the\r\n  Pope, take it as a rule, that there is no place for the poor, he\r\n  favours only the giver; or if there is not a bribe of some value\r\n  or another forthcoming, he answers you, “I am not able.”--The\r\n  Pope, if we come to the truth of the matter, has his name from\r\n  the fact, that, whatever others have, he alone will suck the pap;\r\n  or if you like to apocopate a French word, “pay, pay,” saith the\r\n  word, if you wish to obtain anything.--The Pope begs, the brief\r\n  begs, the bull begs, the gate begs, the cardinal begs, the cursor\r\n  begs,--all beg! and if you have not wherewith to bribe them all,\r\n  your right is wrong, and the whole cause comes to nothing.--You\r\n  give to these, you give to the others, you add gifts to those\r\n  already given, and when you should have given enough, they seek\r\n  as much more. O, you full purses, come to Rome! at Rome there\r\n  is choice medicine for costive pockets.--They all prey upon\r\n  the purse by little and little; great, greater, or greatest,\r\n  gradually becomes a prey to them. Why should I go through all\r\n  the particulars? I will put it in a few words; they all choke\r\n  the purse, and it expires immediately.--Yet the purse imitates\r\n  the liver of Tityus; the substance flies in order to return;\r\n  dies that it may be born: and on this condition Rome preys upon\r\n  the pocket, that when it has given all, it may all be filled\r\n  again.--They return from the court with mitred heads; Jupiter is\r\n  placed in the Infernal Regions, Pluto holds Heaven, and dignity\r\n  is given to a brute animal, as a jewel to the dung and a picture\r\n  to the mud.--The rich give to the rich, that they may receive\r\n  again, and gifts mutually meet one another: that law is most in\r\n  use, which they have caused to be written, “If you give to me, I\r\n  will give to you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING HENRY III. 1216-1272.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of King John offered an opportunity of putting an end to\r\nthe distractions that had become so universal during the latter\r\nyears of his reign, which most of the belligerents were glad\r\nto embrace. The following short, but highly spirited poem, was\r\nprobably written immediately after the pacification which followed\r\nthe taking of Lincoln, apparently by a churchman, and certainly\r\na partizan of King Henry. Some of the expressions in it, such as\r\n“the iron-girt bees of war,” and the like, remind us of the lofty\r\nmetaphors of Saxon verse.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAKING OF LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n[From MS. Cotton.

Conspiring against its own government, and threatening\r\n  rebellion, the degenerate nation,--that it may change freedom\r\n  for slavery,--that it may fall from its high position, from\r\n  health to sickness, from safety to danger,--lays claim to ancient\r\n  laws under a hostile governor; not governed by the balance of\r\n  the law, not by the light of justice, nor by the fire of holy\r\n  counsel, nor yet by the file of reason, the will, in despite of\r\n  reason, darts like lightning into what is forbidden. ¶ The first\r\n  rage was conceived by its own pride; the second drew hither the\r\n  warlike legions of the French; the third conducted the black\r\n  troops of the Scots; the fourth bent the inconstant Welsh under\r\n  their light garment. ¶ The leagues of peace are broken, and the\r\n  threatening thunders follow; corrupt licence has crept into the\r\n  astonished towers, in which Faith lay hid and sick, and long\r\n  waiting a physician of health, at length by the generosity of\r\n  Christ she recovered, and drew out her bands to the wars. ¶ This\r\n  rage, by the sufferance of God, was permitted for a while, but\r\n  not allowed that the lightnings should burn the effeminate minds,\r\n  or that the anger of God should confound the defenceless. But\r\n  the Searcher of hearts recalled by his own love the sheep which\r\n  sought the desert and were long wandering, that he might correct\r\n  the deserving faults with a healing lash, and reconciling his\r\n  divine threats with paternal mercy, softened the corrections of\r\n  a father with the love of a mother. ¶ The honour of the English\r\n  bowed, and the comeliness of the Kingdom; its bending head had\r\n  felt the anger of the divine judge, and feared to serve the proud\r\n  tyrant. The balanced palm, long held out with dubious favour,\r\n  now smiled on the French, now turned its smile to the English,\r\n  applauding with more truth these latter, more deceitful to the\r\n  others. ¶ The anger of an avenging God allowed no longer the\r\n  furious king to reign; he fell, struck by him whose temples and\r\n  houses he had burnt with threatening fire. From this torch arises\r\n  the torch of fate, and the avenging fever, while it raged against\r\n  the king, drove away the rage of the flame. That death was the\r\n  highest honour, and was accompanied with the highest glory, that\r\n  he was in nothing overcome by the enemy, amidst so many enemies;\r\n  vanquished by the conqueror who is above, and unconquered, he\r\n  bit his own enemies even in his death. ¶ Let proud anger cease;\r\n  let power learn to serve and to bow to God, in submitting the\r\n  neck to whom she elevates herself; in rising she falls: short is\r\n  the power of man; and let it learn that the end approaches in\r\n  a few days. ¶ The widowed state had mourned the death of John,\r\n  and, fearing to bow the neck to a degenerate husband, the tear\r\n  of the English calls up the strength of England; the heavier the\r\n  grief, the nearer is its cure. ¶ Meanwhile had shone forth the\r\n  minute spark of most small beauty, the royal offspring, sole\r\n  hope of the torn Kingdom, a star, as it were, lit by God, it had\r\n  divested itself of the cloud that obscured its father, shining\r\n  forth a new light, and the candle of the child called back the\r\n  stars which had been scared by the father’s thunder. ¶ O precious\r\n  piety of God! who masters things that are great, confounds those\r\n  that are strong, raises such as are infirm, strikes ferocity with\r\n  lightning, breaks the haughty, who himself having come a child\r\n  out of the virgin’s womb, thus took a child to nourish, gave it\r\n  to the bosom of the Church, which the gentle parent receives in a\r\n  mother’s arms, rendered gentle by the obedience now newly born,\r\n  and about to place on its head a tender crown. It was heavenly\r\n  ordinance, that the consonant union of holy counsel feared not\r\n  to obey a boy king, and feared more to serve a tyrant. ¶ Sacred\r\n  union matures the new king to lofty things; utility, and piety,\r\n  and faith, swear together to concur with the fates, and to sign\r\n  them all with the seal of the Cross; they had raised together\r\n  the standard of the Cross and had ranged themselves round the\r\n  new King, and the white cross decorating the bearers of the\r\n  Cross fixed the unstable troops in the foundation of faith. ¶\r\n  O famous legation of a man! file of blessed council! star of\r\n  right! mirror of reason! helmet of the worship of God! crested\r\n  with the plume of care! England hath grasped her conquering\r\n  swords by impulse of God; her castles pour forth for the common\r\n  good the standard-bearing troops, fierce in war, and threatening\r\n  the enemy. ¶ What time the Earth had begun to bloom with new\r\n  fruitfulness, and had spread out her fresh grass in locks,\r\n  redolent of flowers had painted the young fleece of the fields,\r\n  and, whilst the new verdure curled the renascent woods, recalled\r\n  innumerable tongues of birds to the song; then the Gallic fury\r\n  had resolved to join the English of the north, the band having\r\n  conspired to pass through the midst of the English, having issued\r\n  from their London, the army of Louis deserted the long shades,\r\n  and the proud earls have the shame of going the way that is\r\n  open to them, and they carry fierce aid to Mountsorrel; for as\r\n  a greater victory attends it, so has the anger of God ordained\r\n  that it should not undergo a greater ruin. But with more caution\r\n  retires thence the nobility of earls, the flower of the faith,\r\n  the royal strength, the shield of Chester, until with roaring\r\n  tumult the rage of the others had passed the famous castle on the\r\n  heights (Nottingham), and the bank of Trent, and the pride of\r\n  long war had flown to the besieged citadel of the noble matron\r\n  (Lincoln). ¶ Hither when the fates have turned the fierce troops\r\n  with a murmuring noise, Fame flies, and calls the earls, and the\r\n  Cestrensian companions of the earls, and the shielded harvest of\r\n  men increases. The royal standards glitter, and the conspiring\r\n  bands follow, when clear faith at last draws out their faces,\r\n  the bright signs of the Cross paint the excelling breasts of\r\n  the youth, a common will strengthens their hearts; there was\r\n  one sole hope of conquering; victory was already stamped on all\r\n  their faces; and with a shout, ominous of good, they put forth\r\n  their associated hands to the accordant battle. ¶ The sabbath was\r\n  at hand in which the festival of the high God is performed, and\r\n  the eve celebrates the triune honour of the deity; the sun was\r\n  touching the earth with his first light, when the trumpet with\r\n  its terrible song had given the flourish; the leaders move iron\r\n  war; many were the standards you might see with tremulous flight\r\n  above the nodding helms, many the shields changing their ensigns\r\n  with various colours. The beauty of the sun shone upon the armed\r\n  troops; the coward became feverish; the brave strengthened their\r\n  hearts. When the constancy of war came to the astonished town,\r\n  the youth encircled the walls with a fearful wreath, and seek new\r\n  approaches; nor do the leaders immediately attack the city; a\r\n  legation is sent in to summon the sacrilegious men to the league\r\n  of peace. Yet no peace satisfied these fierce men; they utter\r\n  insults, despise the messengers, and add threatening words. ¶\r\n  When the messengers bring back the angry message, the leaders\r\n  order their bold followers to the attack; then the horror of\r\n  war roared, the trumpets thundered, a fearful noise rose into\r\n  the air, and in the resounding tumult the clouds might wonder\r\n  at earthly thunders. They leap over the fosses, mount over the\r\n  walls, break the gates, force the passages, and join battle. And\r\n  they made way with their swords; a merited confusion strikes the\r\n  sacrilegious men; the hives of Christ send forth the iron-girt\r\n  bees of war, and with fearful stings they penetrate the hostile\r\n  shirts, and cut the scaly textures of iron, and draw Sauls to the\r\n  chains of Paul, and the holy conversion turned hares into lions.\r\n  ¶ Here stood Moses in the Mount; here Josua had fixed the station\r\n  of the sun; there the sling and stone of David overcome the great\r\n  Golias; the honour of Lincoln sees the venerable wonder; the\r\n  rage of the sea sees the imperial trophy of God; the four-fold\r\n  plague sees the standards rise again against it with conquering\r\n  palm. It saw, and was astonished; and the pride of war felt\r\n  that God fought for the boy; nor was it quiet by its own will,\r\n  but it burst, and received the feet of peace on its neck. ¶ O\r\n  famous day, to be venerated through our age! in which the rage of\r\n  war hid itself,--in which the peace-bringing sword subdued our\r\n  pestiferous divisions,--in which the grace of Christ washed out\r\n  the dishonour that had been brought forth, and, with the font of\r\n  faith, cleansed from the averted brow the disgrace which had been\r\n  inscribed on it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll authorities agree in describing the great pride and avarice\r\nand luxury of the nobles in general, but particularly of the\r\nRomish prelates, at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The\r\nfollowing song is a fair specimen of the unsparing satire which was\r\nuniversally directed against them by their contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG ON THE CORRUPTIONS OF THE TIME.\r\n\r\n[MS.

vices, are enveloped, tell, and\r\n  reveal, O muse, with a mournful countenance, if you care to touch\r\n  the heart of the spectator with your lament.--The wretched and\r\n  profane people seem to form their wishes in consideration, not\r\n  of the price of virtue, but of flax or wool: what is done in the\r\n  evening is unwrought in the morning. O cares of men! O how much\r\n  emptiness there is in things!--Every eye is blind to justice;\r\n  every mind is large to injustice; a thousand hopes of men and\r\n  the differing aspects of things depend on the dice and uses of\r\n  fortune.--When chaste maidens join in dance with the strumpet,\r\n  when the Arabs play the pauper under the robe of a beggar, when\r\n  Tydeus denies his faith to his Polynices, then, if you are\r\n  admitted to the spectacle, my friends, can you restrain your\r\n  laughter?--If you are anxious to know all men by their several\r\n  failings, who practise sloth, who are the plotters of treason,\r\n  who the servants of Mammon, who the despisers of God, we must\r\n  observe the manners of every age of life.--The boy, as he learns\r\n  the use of feet, hates the doors, flies abroad; he respects\r\n  things and honours less than the least; anger and joy succeed\r\n  each other with short intervals, for his changes are sudden.--The\r\n  youth flies from his tutor and confinement; he delights in\r\n  horses, dogs, dice, and wine, a hunter of his pleasures, whose\r\n  occupation is with women, a slow provider of useful things,\r\n  prodigal of money.--When arrived at manhood, that he may rule\r\n  the citizens and dictate to the prætor, that he may extend his\r\n  possessions with a longer cable, and fill his bags with greater\r\n  treasure, he seeks riches and friendships, and is a slave to\r\n  honours.--Many serious troubles surround the old man, either\r\n  that, from stinginess, he spares his perishing wealth, or that\r\n  he handles his riches with fear, lest they should fall to the\r\n  thief; he is one who delays long, depending on hope, inactive,\r\n  and greedy of the future.--Thus difference of time causes variety\r\n  of ages; the tender age is occupied on the affections of the\r\n  heart, the man on lofty things, but he whom old age bends, his\r\n  breast glows with avarice and miserable cupidity.--In this\r\n  respect the whole mind of men grows old, which, while it seeks\r\n  things external, is ignorant of itself in the pursuit; ambition\r\n  is not quieted by success: the love of money increases as fast\r\n  as the money itself increases.--But in this point alone may\r\n  vice claim some credit, that it is always prevalent among the\r\n  great; yet that disposition which respects no control is the more\r\n  conspicuously criminal, in proportion as the sinner occupies a\r\n  higher station.--Rome, lying in the depths of turpitude, ranks\r\n  virtues beneath filthy lucre; fluctuating under the waves of a\r\n  vacillating mind, she overthrows, builds, and changes square\r\n  things for round.--She despises the bland countenances at which\r\n  but now she smiled; she cherishes in her placid breast those whom\r\n  before she rolled down; while she receives money, she treats\r\n  and revises: what she sought she despises, and seeks again what\r\n  lately she let go.--If she does not perceive rightly a thing in\r\n  any manner whatever, and has not forgotten the custom which she\r\n  first learnt, she smells of the custom of the cask, which will\r\n  keep very long the odour with which it was once endued while\r\n  fresh.--Before the cardinals and before the patriarch, a pound\r\n  overcomes the Bible, money the accused, and a marc Mark, the\r\n  law sparing to him who is not sparing, gives only as much grace\r\n  as each has money in his purse.--If you seek the balance of the\r\n  judges, you should seek it with copper, since the favour of the\r\n  balance hangs from copper; you should not ask respite, but ask\r\n  what they ask; whence you obtain it nobody will inquire, but you\r\n  needs must have it.--When you are turned over to the notary, pour\r\n  out your bribes; he will at once extricate you from your cause,\r\n  when, why, or whence it may arise, and will subject the canons to\r\n  the form that is round (i. e. the coin), whom prosperity delights\r\n  not a little.--Rome teaches all that they should fly over to\r\n  expediency, that they should offer heart and hand to Mammon\r\n  rather than to God; thus it happens that the branches smell of\r\n  a bad root; where the head is infirm, the other members are in\r\n  pain.--The archbishops tread under foot the necks of the clergy,\r\n  and extort tears in order that they may be dried by gifts; nor,\r\n  if the poor wretches bring few or not good ones, do they take\r\n  them in good part, or acknowledge them with favour.--If any one\r\n  begins to complain of an injury, they immediately stretch their\r\n  ear to the cause, their hand to the gift; if they once receive\r\n  a thing of the plural number, to-morrow the same basenesses may\r\n  be done as yesterday.--The bishop loves a cheerful giver, and\r\n  dares either right or wrong after the smell of a bribe, unable\r\n  to resume, after he has thrown shame aside, the blush once\r\n  rejected from his worn brow.--Nor is there less baseness in the\r\n  archdeacon; whom he has once taken up, whether in earnest or in\r\n  joke, he holds; nor has he mercy for the needy or the naked;\r\n  the leech which will not let go the skin till he is filled with\r\n  blood.--The dean, born to everlasting wiles, that he may explore\r\n  the creed (symbolum) and the things which succeed, changing the\r\n  tune of his tongue and yesterday’s garments, migrates with humble\r\n  speech to the obscure taverns.--The priest, whatever either the\r\n  dead or the living give, carries all to his fireside-woman, to\r\n  whom he gives himself and what he has; he of the holy name and\r\n  the equal mind, who meditates the law of the Lord by day and by\r\n  night.--The laymen resting on the words of the clergy who depart\r\n  from them, pay less attention to the words than to the character\r\n  of the teacher: nor can laws subdue the senses of men by\r\n  threats and torments, so much as the example of the ruler.--The\r\n  luxurious princes stir kingdoms and states, that they may lead\r\n  armies, inflicting the punishment of a tax on the rustic and the\r\n  miserable citizen; for whenever the kings run wild, the Greeks\r\n  pay the piper.--They who are occupied with the cares of the\r\n  kingdom or of the court, detract while they smile, and when they\r\n  flatter they are plotting damage or disgrace; there is neither\r\n  faith nor honesty in those who follow camps.--If a citizen\r\n  perceive you, he caresses that he may burn you; if you lay down\r\n  ten, he puts the payment of his stake to another time; he cheats\r\n  you out of your own; look to it, while it lasts; he may perish\r\n  behind the wine and the dice, who leaves care till to-morrow.--If\r\n  any one going to the houses of the lawyers, carries his money\r\n  openly, he also is a simpleton; for when he sleeps in his bed\r\n  weary and full, people live by rapine, the guest is not safe\r\n  from his host.--Thus rapine, snares, treachery, and strife, lead\r\n  people into error, misery, and folly; thus ambition and luxury,\r\n  and the revered possession of riches, allure the foolish minds of\r\n  all men.--But what availeth luxury and power to those miserable\r\n  people who, despising virtues, esteem only things that produce\r\n  evil, such as gold, gems, and heaps of wealth? when our labour\r\n  is expended on what is injurious to us, the misery of mortals is\r\n  on the increase.--What avails it to talk of purple, gems, gold,\r\n  land? With riches we have feuds, losses, pleas, fastings, fears,\r\n  and justly sleepless cares come in a long train.--The poor man\r\n  reigns more safely than he that amasses wealth, who, while the\r\n  informer deprives the lord of his favour, or the lurking spoiler\r\n  spoils him who is laden, he, an empty traveller, will sing before\r\n  the thief.--They who are destitute often live more pleasantly\r\n  under a slight hut of brick or mud, than those who are delicately\r\n  clothed in the palaces of kings; he will be ever a slave who\r\n  knows not how to use moderation.--But if you seek abundance of\r\n  true property, reject superfluity, seek what is enough, strip\r\n  yourself of riches, and die naked; delay not this, for those who\r\n  are prepared are ever injured by delay.--If while you are on\r\n  your road to what is more useful, fear dissuade hope, or delay\r\n  endanger success; change not your mind, nor slacken your reins;\r\n  the grateful hour will arrive when least expected.--Treasure up\r\n  that which you cannot abuse, having a care of the needy, the\r\n  blind, the lame, and the dumb; serve your soul, and not your\r\n  mind or your skin; you owe little to pleasure, but more to your\r\n  salvation.--No one is safe on a king’s throne, or in a sanctuary,\r\n  since it can be expressed neither by tongue nor pen by how\r\n  slender a thread the destinies of men hang under the imminent\r\n  approach of death.--While you navigate prosperously the far side\r\n  of the sea, weigh not the present but the future, and considering\r\n  the poop more than the prow or the oar, act as though you thought\r\n  every day your last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Henry III. was even less manly than that of\r\nhis father. Among the many songs of the Normans and Poitevins,\r\nreclaiming the assistance of their ancient sovereign, we may give\r\nas an example the Sirvente of Bernard de Rovenac, addressed to\r\nHenry and his contemporary James I. King of Aragon, from whom\r\nLouis IX. had taken Languedoc to give it as a portion to his\r\nbrother Alphonsus. There is internal evidence that it was written\r\nabout 1229, the year in which Henry III. made his ill-conducted\r\nexpedition into Brittany.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIRVENTE AGAINST KING HENRY.\r\n\r\n[Raynouard, Choix, tom. iv. p. 203.]\r\n\r\n      Ja no vuelh do ni esmenda\r\n          Ni grat retener\r\n          Dels ricx ab lur falz saber,\r\n      Qu’en cor ay que los reprenda\r\n          Dels vils fatz mal yssernitz;\r\n          E no vuelh sia grazitz\r\n      Mos sirventes entr’ els flacx nualhos,\r\n      Paupres de cor et d’ aver poderos.\r\n\r\n      Rey Engles prec que entenda,\r\n          Quar fa dechazar\r\n          Son pauc pretz per trop temer,\r\n      Quar no’l play qu’ els sieus defenda,\r\n          Qu’ans es tan flacx e marritz\r\n          Que par sia adurmitz,\r\n      Qu’el reys frances li tolh en plas perdos\r\n      Tors et Angieus e Normans e Bretos.\r\n\r\n      Rey d’Arago, ses contenda,\r\n          Deu ben nom aver\r\n          Jacme, quar trop vol jazer;\r\n      E qui que sa terra s prenda,\r\n          El es tan flacx e chausitz\r\n          Que sol res no y contraditz;\r\n      E car ven lay als Sarrazis fellos\r\n      L’anta e’l dan que pren say vas Lymos.\r\n\r\n      Ja tró son payre car venda\r\n          No pot trop valer,\r\n          Ni s cug qu’ ieu li diga plazer,\r\n      Tró foc n’abraz e n’essenda\r\n          E n’ sian grans colps feritz;\r\n          Pueys er de bon pretz complitz,\r\n      S’al rey frances merma sos tenezos,\r\n      Quar el sieu fieu vol heretar N Anfos.\r\n\r\n      Coms de Toloza, la renda\r\n          Que soletz tener\r\n          De Belcaire us deu dolar,\r\n      S’al deman faitz lonj’ atenda\r\n          Vos e ’l reys que us es plevitz;\r\n          L’enprendemen n’er aunitz,\r\n      S’ar no vezem tendas e pabalhos,\r\n      E murs fondre, e cazer autas tors.\r\n\r\n          Ricx homes, mal yssernitz,\r\n          En vey hom vostres malz ditz,\r\n      E laissera us, s’ie us vis arditz ni pros,\r\n      Mas no us tem tan que ja m’en lays per vos.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--I wish neither for the gifts and favours--nor to\r\n  obtain the good-will--of the rich, with their false wisdom;--but\r\n  I have in my heart the intention to reproach them--with their\r\n  vile deeds ill-conceived;--and I don’t wish to be agreable--my\r\n  Sirventes among the cowardly idlers,--poor in heart and heavy in\r\n  riches.\r\n\r\n  The English King, I pray him to hear it,--for he causes to\r\n  fall--his little glory by too much timidity,--for it does not\r\n  please him to defend his own people,--and thus he is so cowardly\r\n  and so vile,--that he seems to be asleep,--while the French King\r\n  takes from him with impunity--Tours, and Angiers, and Normans,\r\n  and Bretons.\r\n\r\n  The King of Aragon, without any doubt,--ought really to have the\r\n  name--of James; for he is too willing to lie down;--and whoever\r\n  it be that takes his land,--he is so cowardly and caitiff,--that\r\n  he does not even contradict it;--and he revenges on that side\r\n  against the felon Saracens----the shame and damage which he\r\n  receives on this side towards Limoux.\r\n\r\n  Until he have revenged his father,--he cannot have much\r\n  esteem,--nor let him imagine that I will speak to please\r\n  him,--unless he ravage and put in flames,--and unless great\r\n  blows be struck.--For there will have been accomplished great\r\n  honour,--if he narrows the domains of the French King,--for Don\r\n  Alfonse desires to inherit his fief.\r\n\r\n  Earl of Toulouse, the rent--which you used to hold--from\r\n  Beaucaire, you ought to regret,--if you make long delay to\r\n  demand it,--you, and that King, because you are in league;--that\r\n  undertaking will not be disgraced,--if we now see tents and\r\n  pavilions,--and walls fall and high towers break.\r\n\r\n  Rich men, ill-advised,--one sees your evil sayings,--I would let\r\n  you alone, if I saw you hardy and courageous,--but I do not fear\r\n  you so much as to leave it on your account.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following Sirvente, by the same author, is also directed\r\nagainst Henry and James, and was written about the year 1250. It\r\nrepeats the same articles of accusation, and its object was to\r\npersuade those kings to invade the dominions of Louis, while he was\r\nhimself absent on his crusade.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SIRVENTE AGAINST KING HENRY.\r\n\r\n[Raynouard, tom. iv. p. 205.]\r\n\r\n        D’un sirventes m’es grans volontatz preza,\r\n      Ricx homes flacx, e non sai que us disses,\r\n        Quar ja lauzor no y auria ben meza,\r\n      Ni us aus blasmar, e val pauc sirventes\r\n        Que laza quan blasmar deuria;\r\n        Pero si tot vos par follia,\r\n      A me platz mais que us blasme dizen ver,\r\n      Que si menten vos dizia plazer.\r\n\r\n        Amdos los reys an una cauz’ empressa,\r\n      Selh d’Arago et aisselh dels Engles,\r\n        Que no sia per elhs terra defeza\r\n      Ni fasson mal ad home qu’el lur fes,\r\n        E fan merces e cortezia,\r\n        Quar al rey que conquer Suria\r\n      Laisson en patz lur fieus del tot tener;\r\n      Nostre Senher lur en deu grat saber.\r\n\r\n        Vergonha m pren, quant una gens conqueza\r\n      Nos ten aissi totz vencutz e conques,\r\n        E degr’ esser aitals vergonha prezza,\r\n      Quom a me pren, al rey Aragones\r\n        E al rey que pert Normandia,\r\n        Mas prez an aital companhia\r\n      Que ja nulh temps no fasson lur dever,\r\n      Et anc non vitz autre tan ben tener.\r\n\r\n        E pus no pren en la leuda torneza\r\n      Qu’a Monpeslier li tollon siey borzes,\r\n        Ni no y s venja de l’anta que y a preza,\r\n      Ja no ’lh sia mais retragz Carcasses,\r\n        Pos als sieus eys no s defendria,\r\n        Assatz fa sol qu’en patz estia;\r\n      Patz non a ges senher ab gran poder,\r\n      Quan sas antas torna a non chaler.\r\n\r\n        Ges trop lauzar, quan valors es mal meza,\r\n      Non apel patz, quar mala guerra es;\r\n        Ni ja per me non er per patz enteza,\r\n      Mielhs deuria aver nom gauch de pages,\r\n        E dels ricx que perdon tot dia\r\n        Pretz, e ja fort greu no lur sia,\r\n      Quar pauc perdon e pauc lur deu doler,\r\n      Quar ges de pauc non pot hom trop mover.\r\n\r\n        Lo reys N Anfos a laissat cobezeza\r\n      Als autres reys, qu’a sos ops non vol ges,\r\n        Et a sa part elh a preza largueza,\r\n      Mal a partit qui reptar l’en volgues;\r\n        E dic vos que m par vilania\r\n        Qui partis e qui ’l mielhs s’ atria,\r\n      Mas ges pertant non a fag non dever,\r\n      Quar a pres so qu’elhs no volon aver.\r\n\r\n        Ricx malastrucx, s’ieu vos sabia\r\n        Lauzor, volontiers la us diria;\r\n      Mas no us pessetz menten mi alezer,\r\n      Que vostre grat no vuelh ni vostr’ aver.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--I am seized by a great desire of writing a\r\n  sirvente,--O rich yet cowardly men! and I know not what I shall\r\n  say to you,--for there will be little room for praise;--nor dare\r\n  I blame you, and a sirvente is worth little--which praises when\r\n  it ought to blame:--but though it may seem all folly to you,--yet\r\n  it pleases me more to blame you by telling the truth,--than if I\r\n  spoke falsehood to please you.\r\n\r\n  Both the kings have resolved on one thing,--he of Aragon\r\n  and he of the English,--that by them the land shall not be\r\n  defended,--and that they will do ill to no one who does ill\r\n  to them;--they are merciful and courteous;--for they let the\r\n  King who is conquering Syria--retain their fiefs altogether in\r\n  peace;--our Lord ought to be very thankful to them for it.\r\n\r\n  Shame seizes on me, when a vanquished people--holds us thus all\r\n  subdued and conquered,--and such shame ought to seize--the King\r\n  of Aragon, as seizes me,--and the King who loses Normandy,--but\r\n  they take such company--that now they never perform their\r\n  duty,--and I never saw another hold so well.\r\n\r\n  And afterwards he does not receive the tax,--which at Montpellier\r\n  his burgesses take from him,--neither does he revenge himself of\r\n  the disgrace he received there,--now Carcasson may no more be\r\n  recovered by him;--for he would not defend his own eyes,--his\r\n  only endeavour is that he may be in peace;--a noble lord with\r\n  great power has no peace,--when he turns his ways to nonchalance.\r\n\r\n  To praise people too much, when valour is ill esteemed,--I do not\r\n  call it peace, for it is bad war;--nor shall it now be understood\r\n  by me for peace,--it ought rather to have the name of pages’\r\n  play,--and of the rich who lose every day--honour, and yet it\r\n  grieves them not much,--for they lose little and need not grieve\r\n  much,--for we cannot be moved much by a little thing.\r\n\r\n  The king Don Alfonso has left covetousness--to the other kings,\r\n  because he will not make use of it,--and he has taken for his\r\n  share largess,--he has an ill share who wishes to recover this\r\n  from him;--and I tell you that it appears to me villany,--when\r\n  one shares and takes the best to himself;--yet no one has done\r\n  otherwise than right,--when he has taken that which others will\r\n  not have.\r\n\r\n  Rich men ill-advised, if I knew any thing in you--worthy of\r\n  praise, I would willingly tell you of it;--but think not to take\r\n  up my leisure,--for I desire neither your thanks nor your goods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHenry’s embarrassments at home were now becoming every day\r\nmore numerous and more complicated. Scarcely any part of the\r\nnation, clergy, barons, or people, were any longer his friends.\r\nThe following song (made in 1256) was evidently written by one\r\nbelonging to the former of these classes, indignant at the taxes\r\nwhich the King, with the consent of the Pope, had levied on the\r\nclergy, in the vain hope of placing one of his sons on the throne\r\nof Sicily, and afterwards to pay the debt which he had contracted\r\ntowards the supreme pontiff. The King of France, quoted as an\r\nexample, was the saintly Louis IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF THE CHURCH.\r\n\r\n[MS. Cotton. Jul. D.

But while they seek the mean, they turn into the contrary\r\n  extreme; for vice deceives them in the guise of virtue.\r\n\r\n  Thou who holdest this course, vainly thou callest thyself a\r\n  pastor; neither doest thou govern thyself like a ruler, immersed\r\n  in the heat of temporary affairs; she is another--daughter of the\r\n  leech, whom the venal court has taken to wife.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is another bitter satire on the vices of the great,\r\nduring the reign of Henry III.

AMEN.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--Everybody has a right to satirize the world’s\r\n  vices; for now I see many in the world err, despise what is good,\r\n  love what is bad, and most frequently turning off spontaneously\r\n  to evil.--Because the world is depraved, it knows how to do\r\n  injury; it knows how to act ill, but not how to repent; the\r\n  flesh will do all it can to possess whatever it desires, but is\r\n  unable to fulfill God’s commandments.--Now nobody is esteemed\r\n  unless he knows how to litigate; unless he can cavil cunningly in\r\n  law-suits; unless he can overreach the simple; unless he know how\r\n  to amass abundance of money.--The state of the world is at the\r\n  present day constantly changing; it is always becoming miserably\r\n  worse; for he who spares nobody, and who is bent most on gain,\r\n  is most beloved and most commended.--The King and his nobles are\r\n  sufficiently bitter; almost all the rich men are too avaricious;\r\n  the poor man, who possesses little, must be robbed and spoiled\r\n  of his property to enrich the wealthy.--The rich man is blinded\r\n  by superfluous wealth; his whole mind is occupied with temporal\r\n  matters; and, since he is too much pleased with vanities, he puts\r\n  off the doing of good, but avoids not the evil.--Of the prelates,\r\n  there are very many who, having no fear of God, do evil under\r\n  the mask of good, and they often do more injury than the laymen;\r\n  they take great care of the body, but feed ill the mind.--Now\r\n  impiety reigns, piety is driven away, and noble liberality is\r\n  sent into far exile; for narrow stinginess is the companion\r\n  of many, and thus in many charity is become cold.--Right and\r\n  wrong march nearly on an equal footing; there is now scarcely\r\n  one who is ashamed of doing what is unlawful; the man is\r\n  held dear who knows how to flatter, and he enjoys a singular\r\n  privilege.--Lucre is a thing too much sought after; whoever has\r\n  an eye to it, is considered prudent; he who keeps very close\r\n  what he has, is called a wise man; he who gives liberally, is\r\n  set down for a fool.--Treachery accompanies avarice; perfidy\r\n  is now put on equality with honesty; for he who knows how to\r\n  deceive, is proclaimed a prudent man; and he who does most ill\r\n  is most prized.--There are four persons in particular who work\r\n  thus; who, even while doing ill, are meditating to do worse,\r\n  whose crimes are sufficiently declared below, and whose names\r\n  are as follows:--They are four brothers, Robert, and Richard;\r\n  next Gilbert, a true Wandelard; the fourth is a bastard brother,\r\n  Geoffrey, who is a sluggard, and slow to do anything good.--Each\r\n  of them has a very appropriate name, by which his own character\r\n  is described; for if any one interpret rightly the names, he\r\n  may know most accurately what each signifies.--By _Robert_, is\r\n  very sufficiently indicated _a robber_; and by Richard, with\r\n  much fitness, a _rich hard_ man; _Gilbert_ is not without reason\r\n  called a _guiler_; and _Geoffrey_ is, if we come to the point,\r\n  changed into _jo frai_ (i. e. I will do it).--By these people’s\r\n  names, which are thus described, are denoted the habit, and\r\n  fraud, and works, of many men; and in order that these may be\r\n  made more manifest to all, they are here published better and\r\n  more fully--Robert fleeces, extorts, and threatens; and Richard\r\n  keeps all he gains; Gilbert deceives, and afterwards boasts of\r\n  it; Geoffrey procrastinates, and does nothing.--I will follow up\r\n  the truth now in full cry: every ravenous man is the companion\r\n  of Robert; a false and miserly man is similar to Gilbert; a slow\r\n  and listless man is, without doubt, a Geoffrey.--The latter idly\r\n  protracts the time, behindhand at whatever hour is appointed,\r\n  he neglects to do what is good, and by putting off the good he\r\n  falls into that which is evil, and he is always backward in\r\n  acting well:--he promises anything, but will perform nothing; he\r\n  always says, “I will do,” but never does; but when death is at\r\n  hand, he begins to lament: there is great danger in repenting so\r\n  late.--Let every one take care that he is not himself deceived;\r\n  let him try to repent before his end, that he may merit well\r\n  while he is in health, lest by putting it off, he chance to die\r\n  before it is done.--The Lord, who is the fountain and author of\r\n  the highest degree of piety, give us here the inclination so to\r\n  mourn for our faults, and to be penitent spontaneously while we\r\n  are in health, that in the next world we may be in joy with the\r\n  saints!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA perpetual subject of popular outcry against the great, during\r\nthis and the following centuries, was afforded by the foreign and\r\nextravagant fashions in dress, which were prevalent. A glance at\r\nthe illuminations in contemporary manuscripts will show us that\r\nthese complaints were not without foundation. We, even at the\r\npresent day, can with difficulty conceive the immense sums which\r\nwere in former days expended on the toilet. This profusion was\r\nfrequently and severely commented upon in the prose writings of the\r\nclergy, and was not uncommonly the subject of popular satire. The\r\nfollowing song upon the tailors is very playful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG UPON THE TAILORS.\r\n\r\n[MS. Harl. 978. fol. 99, v^o. reign of Hen.

Gods certainly\r\n  ye are, who can transform an old garment into the shape of a\r\n  new one.--The cloth, while fresh and new, is made either a cape\r\n  or mantle; but, in order of time, first it is a cape, after a\r\n  little space this is transformed into the other; thus ye “change\r\n  bodies.”--When it becomes old, the collar is cut off; when\r\n  deprived of the collar, it is made a mantle: thus, in the manner\r\n  of Proteus, are garments changed; nor is the law of metamorphosis\r\n  a new discovery.--With their shape they change their sex; the\r\n  primates of the church privately close up again what was before\r\n  torn; nor is it given, assuredly, till it has first undergone\r\n  the fortune of Tiresias.--When, at length, winter returns,\r\n  many engraft immediately upon the cape a capuce; then it is\r\n  squared; after being squared it is rounded; and so it becomes an\r\n  aumuce.--If there remain any morsels of the cloth or skin which\r\n  is cut, it does not want a use: of these are made gloves; a glove\r\n  is called in Greek “the placing of the hands.”--This is the\r\n  general manner they all make one robe out of another, English,\r\n  Germans, French, and Normans, with scarcely an exception. Thus\r\n  _cape_ is declined; but _mantle_ otherwise.--In the first year,\r\n  while it is still fresh, the skin and the cloth being both\r\n  new, it is laid up in a box; when, however, the fur begins to\r\n  be worn off, and the thread of the seams broken, the skin is\r\n  circumcised.--Thus the mantle is made a Jew; here lays the cloth,\r\n  there the skin, after the first divorce: being separated from\r\n  its former husband, after separation it passes in reparation\r\n  to marriage with a second husband.--But what will you say is a\r\n  greater crime? this is clearly against right; for if she have\r\n  married a second, the marriage is broken, when a new conjunction\r\n  is made in spite of the reclamations of the old partner.--It is\r\n  neither canonic nor wise to marry two cloths to one fur, and so\r\n  we judge it. Do the decretals permit this? No: on the contrary,\r\n  every canon declares, that it is no marriage.--The cloth having\r\n  been first circumcised, then widowed and separated from its skin,\r\n  now having experienced Judaism, is cleansed by baptism, from\r\n  every stain (_i. e._ it is dyed).--Being circumcised and cleaned,\r\n  and having obtained the testimony of both laws, he whom baptism\r\n  has cleansed, contracts a new marriage with a second skin.--Being\r\n  devoid of hair, and worn by use, from Esau having become Jacob,\r\n  when the hair is fallen from it, the process is inverted, and\r\n  again conversely from Jacob it becomes Esau.--The hairy part is\r\n  turned out, but the old part, concealed inwardly, is bare of\r\n  hairs. Now the hypocritical mantle, in order that there may be\r\n  nothing lost, is given to the servant for his wages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are now approaching the eventful period of the Barons’ wars.\r\nThe turbulent Welshmen were ever ready to seize an opportunity\r\nof invading the Marches; and the following song, whether it were\r\ncomposed by one of them, or be the work of one of the English who\r\ntook the opportunity of satirising them, gives us a fair picture of\r\nthe spirit in which they interfered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF THE WELSH.\r\n\r\n[From the Public Library of Leyden, MS.

And you do not keep this wise counsel; observe\r\n  deceitful people of whom the whole race is accursed.--If our\r\n  valiant predecessor, King Arthur, had been now alive, I am sure\r\n  not one of the Saxon walls would have resisted him; he would\r\n  have been hard to them, spite of their prayers, as they have\r\n  deserved.--May the Omnipotent procure him a successor only\r\n  similar to him, I would not desire a better, who may deliver\r\n  the Britons from their old grievance, and restore to them their\r\n  country and their country’s glory.--May it please the uncle of\r\n  Arthur to obtain this for us, a certain very great saint, [to\r\n  send] the Englishman over the sea; we know that his festival\r\n  is approaching on the kalends of March (St. David’s day), may\r\n  he make it his study to recall the Britons to their native\r\n  land.--Sons imitate their virtuous fathers, so let the Britons\r\n  take Arthur for their example in valour; they show from what a\r\n  good and brave man they are descended; as Arthur was, so let them\r\n  be, conquerors!--The Roman power reigned at Paris, the bold giant\r\n  Frollo, with the bearish mind; him Arthur slew: every person\r\n  of good faith believes it: witness the tent and the Parisian\r\n  island.--He is a madman who kills the noble Britons: it seems\r\n  that he holds them thus hated; for he invidiously proclaims them\r\n  hateful always and incessantly, who he hears are victorious.--Of\r\n  this nation there have been four great commanders, Arthur and\r\n  Broinsius, powerful warriors; Constantine and Brennius, more\r\n  powerful, if it were possible; these held the monarchy by\r\n  reason of their being the best.--France can only boast of her\r\n  Charlemaine; and England glories in the valour of King Richard;\r\n  a larger number overcomes a smaller, because a four-fold glory\r\n  increases the valour of the King.--To these latter it was granted\r\n  to reign within their own bounds; to the others, to triumph,\r\n  over commanders, governors, and kings, with whom they can in no\r\n  respect claim equality: it is a far greater thing to command,\r\n  than to reign.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following fragment of what appears once to have been a long\r\nballad, made to be sung in the halls of the Barons, seems to have\r\nbeen written soon after the disturbances in London in 1263, though\r\nthere is not enough preserved to enable us to determine the precise\r\noccasion on which it was composed.

*    *    *    *\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--But the good Earl of Warenne,--who has so much\r\n  riches and property,--and has skill in war,--in Norfolk in this\r\n  thought--he came conquering his enemies,--but now he has nothing\r\n  to do.\r\n\r\n  Sir John Gifford ought well to be named,--who had scarcely a\r\n  ...--in this riding-bout;--and he was always forward,--valiant\r\n  and wise, and active,--and of great renown.\r\n\r\n  And Sir John Dayville,--who never loved treason or guile,--was in\r\n  their company;--and Sir Peter de Montfort,--he held firm to their\r\n  agreement,--and had great seignory.\r\n\r\n  And the good Roger de Clifford--behaved like a noble baron,--and\r\n  exercised great justice;--he suffered neither little nor\r\n  great,--neither behind or before,--to do any wrong.\r\n\r\n  And Sir Roger de Leyburne,--who often turns him on this side and\r\n  on that,--made great progress conquering;--he laboured much to\r\n  gain,--to restore his losses,--which Sir Edward had caused him\r\n  before.\r\n\r\n  Right good men were the barons;--but I cannot tell all their\r\n  names,--the number is so great:--therefore I return to Earl\r\n  Simon,--to give the interpretation,--what is his name.\r\n\r\n  He is called de Montfort;--he is in the world (_monde_), and he\r\n  is strong (_fort_);--and he has great chivalry:--this is true,\r\n  and I agree to it,--he loves right and hates wrong,--and he shall\r\n  have the mastery.\r\n\r\n  He is truly in the world,--there where the commons are in accord\r\n  with him--which are praised of the land;--it is the Count of\r\n  Leicester,--who may be glad and joyous--of this renown.\r\n\r\n  The Bishop of Hereford--knew well that the Earl was strong,--when\r\n  he took the matter in hand;--before that he (the bishop) was very\r\n  fierce;--he thought to eat up all the English;--but now he does\r\n  not know what to do.\r\n\r\n  And the pastor of Norwich,--who devours his own sheep,--knows\r\n  enough of this story;--he lost much of his goods;--it is pity\r\n  they left him anything,--who was too much acquainted with shame.\r\n\r\n  And Sir John de Langley,--his property was gained,--cursed\r\n  be he who complains of it;--all he had my lord Roger de\r\n  Clifford--caused to be carried away;--he would let nothing remain.\r\n\r\n  Neither to Sir Matthew de Besile--did they leave one\r\n  farthing,--in country or in town.--All his property was\r\n  ravaged,--and neatly was he stripped--by a ‘treget’ without guile.\r\n\r\n  But Sir John de Gray--came to London, and some thing or\r\n  other--made a quarrel--between London and him,--that he lost all\r\n  his harness;--that was his mischance.\r\n\r\n  And Sir William le Latimer--came to London to play, * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following satyrical song seems to have been written on the\r\noccasion of the intermediation of Louis IX. of France, between the\r\ncontending parties in England, in the beginning of the year 1264.\r\nMuch of its point consists in a rather gross play upon words which\r\ncannot always be translated; it is written in a very broad dialect;\r\nand the numerous instances of bad French, which are observed in it,\r\nwere, no doubt, committed intentionally, to increase the hilarity\r\nof the listeners, at the expense of the English and their King.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG OF THE PEACE WITH ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n[From a MS. of the thirteenth century, in the Bibl. du Roi, at\r\nParis, No. 7218, fol. 220, v^o.]\r\n\r\n      Or vint la tens de May, que ce

.i. part,\r\n      Li et Trichart sa frer irrous comme lipart.\r\n      Il suspire de cul, si se claima à l’art,--\r\n      “Hui Diex! com puis-je voir de Normandi ma part?”\r\n\r\n      “Ne vous maie mi,” dit la conte à Clocestre,\r\n      “Vous porra bien encors; tel chos poistron bien estre,\r\n      Se Diex salva ma cul, ma pié, et ma poing destre,\r\n      Tu sarra sus Parris encore troute mestre.”\r\n\r\n      La cont Vincestre dit au buer rai d’Ingletiere,\r\n      “Rai, rai, veus-tu sivier? Festes mouvoir ton guere,\r\n      Et je te conduira trestout ton gent à foire:\r\n      Tu porras Normandi à ce pointes conquerre.”\r\n\r\n      “Se je pois rai François à bataille contrier,\r\n      Et je porrai mon lance desus son cul poier,\r\n      Je crai que je ferra si dourrement chier\r\n      Qu’il se brisa son test, ou ma cul fu rompier.\r\n\r\n      Je prendrez bien droitur, se je puis, à Diex poise,\r\n      Quant j’arra en mon main Normandi et Pontoise;\r\n      Je ferra soz Parris achier mon gent Gloise,\r\n      Puis vondrai prender Frans, maugré conte d’Angoise.\r\n\r\n      Par la .v. plais à Diex, François maubali sont;\r\n      Si g’i la puis grapier, certes il chateront.\r\n      Quant Inglais irront là, mult bahot i serront;\r\n      Par la mort Dieu! je crai que toutes s’enfuiront.”\r\n\r\n      Sir Symon à Montfort atendi ce navel,\r\n      Doncques sailli à piez; il ne fout mie bel.\r\n      A dit à rai Inglais, “Par le cors saint Anel!\r\n      Lessiez or cesti chos:--François n’est mi anel.\r\n\r\n      Se vous aler seur leus, il se voudra dafandre:\r\n      Toute ta paveillons metra feu à la cendre.\r\n      Il n’a si vaelant qui l’ose mi atendre;\r\n      Mult sarra maubali qui le François puet prendre.”\r\n\r\n      “Qoi dites-vous, Symon?” pona Rogier Bigot;\r\n      “Bien tenez-vous la rai por binart et por sot?\r\n      Fout insi hardouin que vous sone plus mot,\r\n      Ne te pot besoner por vostre mileur cot!”\r\n\r\n      “Sir Rogier,” dit la rai, “por Dieu, ne vous chaele!\r\n      Ne sai mi si irrous contre ce merdaele.\r\n      Je ne dout mi Françoys tout qui sont une mele;\r\n      Je farra ma talent comment la chos aele.\r\n\r\n      Je pandra bien Parris, je suis toute certaine;\r\n      Je bouterra le fu en cele eve qui [fu] Saine;\r\n      La moulins arderra; ce fi chos mult gravaine\r\n      Se n’i menja de pain de troute la semaine.\r\n\r\n      [P]ar la .v. plais à Diex, Parris fout vil mult grant\r\n      Il i a .i. chapel dont je fi coetant;\r\n      Je le ferra portier, à .i. charrier rollant,\r\n      A Saint Amont à Londres toute droit en estant.\r\n\r\n      Quant j’arra soz Parris mené tout me naviaus,\r\n      Je ferra le moustier Saint Dinis la Chanciaus\r\n      Corronier d’Adouart soz sa blonde chaviaus.\r\n      La voudra vous toer de vaches à porciaus.\r\n\r\n      Je crai que vous verra là endret grosse fest,\r\n      Quant d’Adouart arra corroné France test.\r\n      Il l’a bien asservi, ma fil; il n’est pas best;\r\n      Il fout buen chivaler, hardouin, et honest.”\r\n\r\n      “Sir rai,” ce dit Rogier, “por Dieu à mai entent;\r\n      Tu m’as percé la cul, tel la pitié m’a prent.\r\n      Or doint Godelamit, par son culmandement,\r\n      Que tu fais cestui chos bien gloriousement!”\r\n\r\n              _Explicit la pais aus Englois._\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--Now comes the time of May, when the rose will\r\n  open,--when the seasons will be fair, and the nightingale\r\n  sing,--the fields will be green, and the gardens will bloom;--I\r\n  have found behind me a thing which I will relate.\r\n\r\n  Of my King of England, who is in a good ship,--a valiant knight,\r\n  hardy, and loyal,--and of Edward his son, who hath flaxen\r\n  hair,--it pleases me to make a saying which is quite new.\r\n\r\n  And of that King of France, that long baron,--who held Normandy\r\n  wrongfully by ill event;--long time did he settle his house upon\r\n  Paris,--that he never but for a war alone put on his spur.\r\n\r\n  Lords, attend to me; you must not laugh:--all the world ought to\r\n  cry this news which I bring.--The other day there was at London\r\n  a great assembly;--there no baron, from the best to the worst,\r\n  would move,\r\n\r\n  But they would all come to this great debating.--There would have\r\n  been done such a thing, I believe truly,--that it would have\r\n  caused the French King a great fright--concerning the lands which\r\n  he holds against the English people.\r\n\r\n  Lords, it is a long time since Merlin prophecied--that Philip of\r\n  France, a lord who was formerly,--should conquer all the land,\r\n  such as it is, on this side;--but, at all events, I say it, the\r\n  English will still have it.\r\n\r\n  Now is come the time that the English would make an inroad,--if\r\n  he should find the French inclined to grumble,--who would appear\r\n  frightened by swords and by greyhounds(?),--that he would have no\r\n  courage to grumble against the English.\r\n\r\n  The good King of England drew himself on one side,--he and\r\n  Richard his brother, as angry as leopards.--He sighs from behind,\r\n  and so cries with alacrity,--“O God! how may I have my part of\r\n  Normandy?”\r\n\r\n  “Do not disturb yourself at all,” said the Earl of\r\n  Gloucester,--“you may still do it; such things may still\r\n  easily be,--if God preserve my backside, my foot, and my right\r\n  fist,--thou shalt still be entire master over Paris.”\r\n\r\n  The Earl of Winchester said to the noble King of England,--“King,\r\n  King, wilt thou follow? Set agoing the war,--and I will conduct\r\n  thee all thy people in abundance:--at this juncture thou wilt be\r\n  able to conquer Normandy.\r\n\r\n  “If I can constrain the King of France to a battle,--and I can\r\n  strike him with my lance behind,--I think that I shall make him\r\n  fall so hard--that he will break his head, or my tail will be\r\n  broken.\r\n\r\n  “I will take good right, if I can, with God’s will,--when I shall\r\n  have in my hand Normandy and Poitou,--I will make my English\r\n  people approach to Paris,--and then I will go to take France in\r\n  spite of the Earl of Anjou.\r\n\r\n  “By the five wounds of God! the French are in bad case;--if I\r\n  can lay hold upon them, truly they shall be punished.--When the\r\n  English go there, there will be a great disturbance;--God’s\r\n  death! I think they will all fly away.”\r\n\r\n  Sir Simon de Montfort heard this speech,--then he leaped on his\r\n  feet; he did not look very handsome.--Says he to the English\r\n  King, “By the body of the holy Lamb!--now let this thing alone;\r\n  the Frenchman is not a lamb.\r\n\r\n  “If you attack them, they will defend themselves:--he will burn\r\n  all thy tents to ashes.--There is no man so valiant who dare wait\r\n  for him;--they will be in ill case whom the Frenchman can catch.”\r\n\r\n  “What is that you say, Simon?” replied Roger Bigot;--“do you take\r\n  the King for a simpleton and a fool?--if you are so bold as to\r\n  say another word,--you will not serve yourself with your best\r\n  coat.”\r\n\r\n  “Sir Roger,” said the King, “for God’s sake! dont be in a\r\n  heat;--I am not so angry against this scamp.--I dont care half a\r\n  farthing for all the French that are;--I will do as I like, let\r\n  the matter go as it will.\r\n\r\n  “I will easily take Paris, I am quite certain;--I will set fire\r\n  to the river which is called Seine;--I will burn the mill; this\r\n  will be a very grievous thing,--if they eat no bread all the week.\r\n\r\n  “By the five wounds of God! Paris is a very great city!--There is\r\n  a chapel, of which I am desirous;--I will cause it to be carried\r\n  in a rolling cart,--straight to Saint Amont in London, just as it\r\n  stands.\r\n\r\n  “When I have led all my ships to Paris,--I will cause the\r\n  Chancellor in the monastery of St. Denis--to crown Edward on his\r\n  flaxen hair.--There I will kill for you cows and pigs.\r\n\r\n  “I believe that you will see there a great feast,--when France\r\n  shall have crowned Edward’s head. He has well deserved it, my\r\n  son; he is no fool;--he is a good knight, brave, and courteous.”\r\n\r\n  “Sir King,” said Roger, “for God’s sake, listen to me;--thou hast\r\n  pierced me behind, so much has pity overcome me;--Now may God\r\n  Almighty ordain by his commandment,--that thou perform this thing\r\n  very gloriously!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decisive battle of Lewes, in 1264, was the subject of great\r\nexultation amongst the adherents of Simon de Montfort. The\r\nfollowing song, in English, is directed against the king’s brother,\r\nRichard Earl of Cornwall, who had become very unpopular by his\r\nforeign schemes of ambition. He took shelter at a windmill, after\r\nhe saw the king’s party defeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG AGAINST THE KING OF ALMAIGNE.\r\n\r\n[MS. Harl. No. 2253, fol. 58 v^o, of the reign of Edw.

It bears internal proofs of having been written immediately\r\nafter the decisive battle of Lewes; and the moderate and deeply\r\nmoral and religious feeling which the reforming party here shows,\r\neven in the moment of triumph, is extremely remarkable, and is\r\nclosely connected with the complaints against the licentiousness\r\nof the other party in the satyrical songs which precede. We might\r\nalmost suppose ourselves transported to the days of Wickliffe or\r\nCromwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF LEWES.\r\n\r\n[MS.

let\r\n  all those people now learn to put their trust in thee, whom they,\r\n  who are now scattered, wished to destroy--they of whom the head\r\n  is now taken, and the members are in captivity; the proud people\r\n  is fallen; the faithful are filled with joy. Now England breathes\r\n  in the hope of liberty; [10] to which (England) may the grace of\r\n  God give prosperity! The English were despised like dogs; but now\r\n  they have raised their head over their vanquished enemies.\r\n\r\n  In the year of grace one thousand two hundred and sixty-four,\r\n  and on the Wednesday after the festival of St. Pancras, the army\r\n  of the English bore the brunt of a great battle at the castle\r\n  of Lewes: for reasoning yielded to rage, and life to the sword.\r\n  They met on the fourteenth of May, [20] and began the battle of\r\n  this terrible strife; which was fought in the county of Sussex,\r\n  and in the bishopric of Chichester. The sword was powerful;\r\n  many fell; truth prevailed; and the false men fled. For the\r\n  Lord of valour resisted the perjured men, and defended those\r\n  who were pure with the shield of truth. The sword without, and\r\n  fear within, routed the former; the favour of heaven comforted\r\n  very fully the latter. The solemnities of the victor, and the\r\n  sacred crowns, [30] give testimony on this contest; since the\r\n  Church honoured the said persons as saints, and victory crowned\r\n  the true soldiers. The wisdom of God, which rules the whole\r\n  world, performed miracles and made a joyful war; caused the\r\n  strong to fly, and the valorous men to shut themselves up in\r\n  a cloister, and in places of safety. Not in arms, but in the\r\n  grace of Christianity, that is in the Church, remained the only\r\n  refuge for those who were excommunicated; after deserting their\r\n  horses [40] this counsel alone occurred to the vanquished. And\r\n  her whom previously they had not hesitated to profane, her whom\r\n  they ought to have honoured in the place of a mother--in her\r\n  they seek refuge, though little worthy of it, and seek their\r\n  defence in embracing the wood of salvation. Those whom prosperity\r\n  caused to despise their mother, their wounds compelled to know\r\n  their mother. When at Northampton they succeeded by treachery,\r\n  the faithless children despised the church; with the sword they\r\n  disturbed the bowels of the holy mother, and in their prosperity\r\n  [50] did not merit a successful war. The mother then bore the\r\n  injury patiently, as though heedless of it, but not letting it\r\n  pass unmarked: she punishes this and other injuries which were\r\n  afterwards added, for the madmen ravaged many churches; and the\r\n  band of enraged men, which has now been thrown into confusion,\r\n  mercilessly spoiled the monastry which is called Battle, of its\r\n  goods, and thus they prepared a _battle_ for themselves. The\r\n  Cistercian monks of Robertsbridge [60] would not have been safe\r\n  from the fury of the sword, unless they had given five hundred\r\n  marks to the prince, which Edward ordered to be received, or\r\n  they had perished. By these, and similar deeds, they merited to\r\n  give way and succumb before their enemies. May the Lord bless\r\n  Simon de Montfort! and also his sons and his army! who, exposing\r\n  themselves magnanimously to death, fought valiantly, condoling\r\n  the lamentable lot of the English who, trodden under foot in a\r\n  manner scarcely to be described, [70] and almost deprived of all\r\n  their liberties, nay, of their lives, had languished under hard\r\n  rulers, like the people of Israel under Pharaoh, groaning under\r\n  a tyrannical devastation. But God, seeing this suffering of the\r\n  people, gives at last a new Matathias, and he with his sons,\r\n  zealous after the zeal of the law, yields neither to the insults\r\n  nor to the fury of the king.\r\n\r\n  They call Simon a seductor and a traitor; [80] but his deeds\r\n  lay him open and prove him to be a true man. Traitors fall off\r\n  in time of need; they who do not fly death, are those who stand\r\n  for the truth. But says his insidious enemy now, whose evil eye\r\n  is the disturber of peace, “If you praise the constancy and the\r\n  fidelity, which does not fly the approach of death or punishment,\r\n  they shall equally be called constant who, in the same manner, go\r\n  to the combat fighting on the opposite side, in the same manner\r\n  exposing themselves to the chance of war, [90] and subjecting\r\n  themselves to a hard appellation.” But in our war in which we are\r\n  now engaged, let us see what is the state of the case.\r\n\r\n  The earl had few men used to arms; the royal party was numerous,\r\n  having assembled the disciplined and greatest warriors in\r\n  England, such as were called the flower of the army of the\r\n  kingdom; those who were prepared with arms from among the\r\n  Londoners, were three hundred set before several thousands;\r\n  whence they were contemptible to those, [100] and were detested\r\n  by those who were experienced. Much of the earl’s army was\r\n  raw; fresh in arms, they knew little of war. The tender youth,\r\n  only now girt with a sword, stands in the morning in battle\r\n  accustoming himself to arms; what wonder if such an unpractised\r\n  tyro fear, and if the powerless lamb dread the wolf? Thus those\r\n  who fight for England are inferior in military discipline, and\r\n  they are much fewer than the strong men, who boasted in their own\r\n  valour, [110] because they thought safely, and without danger,\r\n  to swallow up, as it were, all whom the earl had to help him.\r\n  Moreover, of those whom the earl had brought to the battle, and\r\n  from whom he hoped for no little help, many soon withdrew from\r\n  fear, and took to flight as though they were amazed; and of three\r\n  parts, one deserted. The earl with a few faithful men never\r\n  yielded. We may compare our battle with that of Gideon; [120] in\r\n  both of which we see a few of the faithful conquer a great number\r\n  who have no faith, and who trust in themselves like Lucifer did.\r\n  God said, “If I should give the victory to the many, the fools\r\n  will not give the glory to me, but to fools.” So if God had made\r\n  the strong to conquer, the common people would have given the\r\n  credit of it to the men, and not to God.\r\n\r\n  From these considerations it may be concluded that the warlike\r\n  men did not fear God, wherefore they did nothing to prove their\r\n  constancy or fidelity, [130] but they showed on the contrary\r\n  their pride and cruelty; and wishing to confound those whom\r\n  they despised, issuing forth boldly, they perished quickly.\r\n  Exaltation of the heart brings on ruin, and humility merits to\r\n  receive the divine grace; for he who does not trust in God,\r\n  God overthrows his pride. We may bring forward as examples\r\n  Aman and Mardocheus; we read that the former was arrogant, the\r\n  latter a true Israelite; the gallows which Aman had prepared for\r\n  Mardocheus, [140] in the morning the wretch bore it himself in\r\n  order to be hanged upon it. The queen’s banquet blinded Aman,\r\n  which he reputed as an extraordinary privilege; but his vain\r\n  expectation is turned into confusion, when after the feast he is\r\n  dragged to the gallows. Thus sorrow followed close upon joy, when\r\n  it coupled death with the end of the feast. Very differently,\r\n  it happens, to the Israelite, whom, by God’s will, the king\r\n  honours. Golias is overthrown by the stroke of a little stone;\r\n  [150] nothing profits him whom God pursues. Add to the various\r\n  reasons already mentioned, that the stinking bawds collected\r\n  with them so many strumpets, amounting to seven hundred, which\r\n  they ought to have known to be fraudulent persons, disciples of\r\n  Satan to deceive men’s souls, and matches to set them on fire,\r\n  treacherous scissars to cut the hairs of Samson, inflicting the\r\n  stains of base action on the wretches who are not strong in\r\n  heart, [160] nor made firm by the grace of the divine gift, but\r\n  animals dedicated to the lust of the flesh, by the uncleanness\r\n  of which, reduced to the level of brutes, they ought not to\r\n  be worthy of victory, who grovelled in the foul luxury of the\r\n  flesh; they diminish their strength in the stews which they had\r\n  made, therefore they were unworthy of the attributes of knights.\r\n  A knight is girt on the thigh with a sword, that it may not be\r\n  ungirt, and that vile deeds should be eschewed; the body of a new\r\n  knight is accustomed to be bathed, [170] in order that he may\r\n  learn to be clean from unlawful deeds. They who had newly married\r\n  lawful wives, were not fit for the Lord’s warfare, as the battle\r\n  of Gideon witnesseth, much less those whom the furnace of luxury\r\n  hath injured with its fire. Why then should God help adulterers,\r\n  and not rather strengthen clean children? Let them be clean who\r\n  desire to conquer in fighting; they who vanquish their faults are\r\n  in the way to triumph; first let them conquer their vices, [180]\r\n  who wish with justice to have the victory over sinners. If the\r\n  just man seems sometimes to be vanquished by the impious man, on\r\n  the contrary he should be reputed the conqueror; for neither can\r\n  the just man be vanquished, nor the unjust man conquer while he\r\n  is the enemy of the law.\r\n\r\n  Listen to the equity of Earl Simon: when the royal party would\r\n  be satisfied only with his head and his life, nor would allow\r\n  his head to be redeemed, but would have it cut off, by whose\r\n  confusion they hoped the body of the people should be confounded,\r\n  [190] and the greatest part of the state brought into danger,\r\n  so that the most grievous ruin would immediately follow;--may\r\n  it be very long before this happen!--Stephen, by divine grace,\r\n  bishop of Chichester, groaning deeply for the immense evils which\r\n  were then impending, (without exaggeration,) the two parties\r\n  being persuaded to treat of a peace, received this answer from\r\n  the Earl: “Choose the best men, who have a lively faith, [200]\r\n  who have read the decretals, or who have taught, in a becoming\r\n  manner, theology and sacred wisdom, and who know how to rule the\r\n  Christian faith, whatever they may resolve by sound doctrine, or\r\n  whatever they may have the courage to decree, they shall find us\r\n  ready to agree to what they shall dictate, in such a manner as\r\n  that we may escape the stigma of perjury, and keep the league as\r\n  children of God.” Hence it may easily be understood by those who\r\n  swear, and show little reluctance to despise what they swear,\r\n  receding quickly from it although they swear to what is right,\r\n  [210] and not rendering whole what they have promised to God,\r\n  with how much care they ought to keep their oath, when they see\r\n  a man neither avoiding torment nor death on account of his oath,\r\n  which was made not inconsiderately, but for the reformation of\r\n  the fallen state of the English nation, which the fraud of an\r\n  inveterate enemy had violated. Behold Simon, obedient, despises\r\n  the loss of property, submitting himself to punishment, rather\r\n  than desert the truth, proclaiming to all men openly by his deeds\r\n  more than by his words, [220] that truth has nothing in common\r\n  with falsehood. Woe to the perjured wretches who fear not God!\r\n  denying him for the prospect of an earthly reward, or for fear of\r\n  imprisonment or light punishment; the new leader of the journey\r\n  teaches to bear all that the world may inflict on account of\r\n  truth, for it is this which can give perfect liberty. For the\r\n  Earl had first pledged his oath that whatever the zeal of the\r\n  wise had provided for the reformation of the King’s honour, [230]\r\n  and for the repression of wandering error, at Oxford, he would\r\n  steadfastly keep it, and would not change the law then ordained,\r\n  knowing that such canonical constitutions, and such catholic\r\n  ordinances for the pacific conservation of the kingdom, on\r\n  account of which he had before sustained no slight persecution,\r\n  were not to be despised; and because he had sworn to hold them\r\n  firmly, unless the most perfect doctors of the faith should say,\r\n  [240] that the jurators might be absolved, who had before taken\r\n  such oath, and that no further account was to be made of what\r\n  they had sworn. Which, when the said bishop recited to the king,\r\n  and perhaps the artificer of fraud was standing by, the voice of\r\n  the crowd of arrogant courtiers was raised high, “See now the\r\n  soldier is to give way to the sayings of clerks! The military\r\n  order subjected to clerks is debased!” Thus the wisdom of the\r\n  Earl was despised; and Edward is said to have answered thus:\r\n  [250] “They shall have no peace unless they all put halters about\r\n  their necks, and deliver themselves up to us to be hanged, or\r\n  to be drawn.” What wonder if the Earl’s heart was then moved,\r\n  when nothing but the pain of the stake was prepared for him? He\r\n  offered what he ought to do, but he was not listened to; the king\r\n  rejected measure, forgetting what was good for him. But, as the\r\n  event of the matter next day taught him, the measure which he\r\n  then refused, afterwards was not to be had. In the evening was\r\n  derided the Earl’s devotion, [260] the shock of which, next day,\r\n  was found to be victorious. This stone, long rejected from the\r\n  doorway, was afterwards fitted to the two walls. The division\r\n  of England was on the verge of desolation, but the corner-stone\r\n  was there as a help to the division, the truly singular religion\r\n  of Simon. The faith and fidelity of Simon alone becomes the\r\n  security of the peace of all England; he humbles the rebellious,\r\n  raises those who were in despair, [270] reconciling the kingdom,\r\n  repressing the proud. And how does he repress them? certainly not\r\n  by praising them; but he presses out the red juice in the hard\r\n  conflict; for truth obliges him to fight, or to desert the truth,\r\n  and prudently he chooses rather to devote his right hand to the\r\n  truth, and by the rough way, which is joined to probity, by the\r\n  harder and shorter way which is unpleasant to the proud, to\r\n  obtain the reward which is given to those who use force, than to\r\n  displease God by shrinking, [280] and to promote the designs of\r\n  bad men by flight. For some men had studied to erase the name of\r\n  the English, whom they had already begun to regard with hatred,\r\n  against whom God opposed a medicine, since he did not desire\r\n  their sudden ruin.\r\n\r\n  Hence let the English learn to call in strangers, if they wish to\r\n  be exiled by strangers. For these when they wish to enlarge their\r\n  own glory, and wish their own memory to stand always, study to\r\n  associate with themselves very many of their own nation, [290]\r\n  and by degrees to make them the principal nobles; and thus grows\r\n  the confusion of the natives, with indignation and bitterness of\r\n  heart, when the chief men of the kingdom feel themselves to be\r\n  beaten down by those who make themselves their equals, taking\r\n  from them the things which ought to appertain to them, growing by\r\n  the things by which they used to grow. The King ought to honour\r\n  with escheats and wards his own people, who can help him in\r\n  various ways, who, by as much as they are more powerful by their\r\n  own strength, [300] are so much the more secure in all cases.\r\n  But those who have brought nothing, if they are enriched by his\r\n  goods, if they are made great who were of no account, such men,\r\n  when they begin to grow, always go on climbing till they have\r\n  supplanted the natives; they study to avert the prince’s heart\r\n  from his own people, that they may strip of glory those whose\r\n  ruin they are seeking. And who could bear such things patiently?\r\n  Therefore let England learn prudently to have a care, lest such a\r\n  perplexity should happen any more, [310] lest such an adversity\r\n  should fall upon the English. The Earl studied to obviate this,\r\n  because it had gained too much head, like a great sea, that could\r\n  not be dried by a small effort, but must be forded by a great\r\n  assistance from God. Let strangers come to return quickly, like\r\n  men of a moment, but not to remain. One of the two hands aids\r\n  the other, neither of them bearing more really the grace which\r\n  belongs to both; let it help, and not injure, by retaining its\r\n  place. [320] Each thing would avail its own possessor if they\r\n  come so; the Frenchman by doing good to the Englishman, and not\r\n  seducing by a flattering face, nor the one withdrawing the goods\r\n  of the other; but rather by sustaining his own portion of the\r\n  burden. If his own interest had moved the Earl, he would neither\r\n  have had any other zeal, nor would he have sought with all his\r\n  power for the reformation of the kingdom, but he would have aimed\r\n  at power, he would have sought his own promotion only, and made\r\n  his first object the promotion of his friends, [330] and would\r\n  have aimed at enriching his children, and would have neglected\r\n  the weal of the community, and would have covered the poison\r\n  of falsehood with the cloak of duplicity, and would thus have\r\n  deserted the faith of Christianity, and would have subjected\r\n  himself to the retribution of fearful punishment, nor would he\r\n  have escaped the weight of the tempest, And who can believe that\r\n  he would give himself to death, that he would sacrifice his\r\n  friends, in order that he might thus raise himself high? If those\r\n  who hunt after honour cover their object cunningly; [340] always\r\n  meditating at the same time how they may avoid death; none love\r\n  more the present life, none choose more eagerly a position devoid\r\n  of danger. They who thirst after honours dissimulate their aim,\r\n  they make themselves cautiously the reputation which they seek.\r\n  Not so the venerable Simon de Montfort, who, like Christ, offers\r\n  himself a sacrifice for many; Isaac does not die, although he\r\n  is ready for death; it is the ram which is given to death, and\r\n  Isaac receives honour. Neither fraud nor falsehood promoted the\r\n  Earl, [350] but the Divine grace which knew those whom it would\r\n  help. If you consider the time and the place of the conflict, you\r\n  will find that they promised him a defeat rather than victory;\r\n  but God provided that he should not succumb. He does not take\r\n  them on a sudden by creeping stealthily by night; but he fights\r\n  openly when day is come. So also the place was favourable to\r\n  his enemies, that thus it might appear plainly to all to be the\r\n  gift of God, that victory departed from him who put his trust\r\n  in himself. [360] Hence let the military order, which praises\r\n  the practice of the tournament, that so it may be made expert at\r\n  fighting, learn how the party of the strong and skilful was here\r\n  bruised by the arms of those who were feeble and unpractised:\r\n  that he may confound the strong, God promotes the weak, comforts\r\n  the feeble, lays prostrate the firm. Thus let no one now presume\r\n  to trust in himself; but if he know how to place his hope in\r\n  God, he may take up arms with constancy, nothing doubting, [370]\r\n  since God is a help for those who are on the side of justice.\r\n  Thus it was right that God should help the Earl, for without God\r\n  he could not overcome the enemy. Of whom should I call him the\r\n  enemy?--of the Earl alone? or should I recognise him as the enemy\r\n  of the English and of the whole kingdom?--perhaps also of the\r\n  Church, and therefore of God? And if so, how much grace ought he\r\n  to have? He failed to deserve grace who trusted in himself, and\r\n  he did not merit to be helped who did not fear God. Thus falls\r\n  the boast of personal valour, [380] and so for evermore praised\r\n  be the Lord God of vengeance! who gives aid to those who are\r\n  destitute of force, to a few against many, crushing fools by the\r\n  valour of the faithful; who sits on a throne in heaven above,\r\n  and by his own strength treads upon the necks of the proud,\r\n  bowing the great under the feet of the less. He has subdued\r\n  two kings and the heirs of kings, whom he has made captives,\r\n  because they were transgressors of the laws; and he has turned\r\n  to shame the pomp of knighthood with its numerous retinue; [390]\r\n  for the barons employed on the sons of pride the arms, which,\r\n  in their zeal for justice, they had taken up in the cause of\r\n  the kingdom, until victory was given them from heaven, with a\r\n  great glory that was not expected. For the bow of the strong was\r\n  then overcome, and the troop of the weak was established with\r\n  strength; and we have said that it was done by heaven, lest any\r\n  one should boast of it; let all the honour, on the contrary, be\r\n  given to Christ, in whom we believe! For Christ at once commands,\r\n  conquers, reigns! [400] Christ delivers his own, to whom he has\r\n  given his promise. We pray God to grant that the minds of the\r\n  conquerors may not attribute their success to themselves, and let\r\n  what Paul says be observed by them, “He who would be joyful, let\r\n  him be joyful in God.” If any one of us indulge in vain glory,\r\n  may God be indulgent to him, and not angry! and may he make our\r\n  party cautious in future; lest deeds be wanting, may they make\r\n  themselves a wall! May the power of the Almighty perfect what it\r\n  has begun, [410] and restore to its vigour the kingdom of the\r\n  English people! that glory may be to himself, and peace to his\r\n  elect, until they be in the country where he shall lead them.\r\n  O Englishmen! read this concerning the battle of Lewes! by the\r\n  influence of which you are saved from destruction: for if victory\r\n  had gone over to those who are now vanquished, the memory of the\r\n  English would have lain in disgrace.\r\n\r\n  To whom shall the noble Edward be compared? Perhaps he will be\r\n  rightly called a leopard. If we divide the name, it becomes a\r\n  lion and a pard:--[420] a lion, for we have seen that he was not\r\n  slow to meet the strongest; fearing the attack of none; making\r\n  a charge in the thick of the battle with the most unflinching\r\n  bravery, and as though at his will, and wherever he went, as\r\n  if, like Alexander, he would soon subdue the whole world, if\r\n  the mutable wheel of Fortune would but stand still; in which,\r\n  although he stand at the top, let him know that his fall is near\r\n  at hand, and that he who reigns like a lord will not reign long.\r\n  Which, in fact, has happened to the noble Edward, [430] who has\r\n  manifestly fallen from his unstable position. He is a lion by his\r\n  pride and by his ferocity; by his inconstancy and changeableness\r\n  he is a pard, not holding steadily his word or his promise, and\r\n  excusing himself with fair words. When he is in a difficulty, he\r\n  promises just what you will; but as soon as he has escaped the\r\n  danger, he forgets his promise. Witness Gloucester, where, as\r\n  soon as he was out of the difficulty, he revoked immediately what\r\n  he had sworn. The treachery or falseness by which he gains his\r\n  ends [440] he calls prudence; the way by which he arrives at his\r\n  object, be it ever so crooked, is reputed to be straight; when\r\n  wrong serves his purpose, it is called right; he calls lawful\r\n  whatever he wills, and thinks himself absolved from the law,\r\n  as though he were greater than a king: for every king is ruled\r\n  by the laws which he enacts. King Saul was deposed, because he\r\n  brake the laws; and we read that David was punished, as soon as\r\n  he did contrary to the law; hence, therefore, let him who reads\r\n  know, that he cannot reign who does not keep the law; [450]\r\n  nor ought they, whose province it is to do so, to elect such a\r\n  man for their king. O Edward! thou desirest to be made a king\r\n  without law; they would be truly miserable who were ruled by\r\n  such a king! For what is more just than law, by which all things\r\n  are ruled? and what more true than justice, by which all things\r\n  are administered? If thou wouldest have a kingdom, reverence the\r\n  laws; they are but rough roads, which are opposed to law, rough\r\n  and crooked roads which will not lead thee to thy journey’s end;\r\n  but if thou keepest the laws, they shine like a lamp. Therefore\r\n  avoid and detest treachery; [460] labour after truth and hate\r\n  falsehood. Although treachery may flourish, it cannot bear fruit;\r\n  the Psalm may teach thee this; God says to the faithful of the\r\n  earth, “They are my eyes, and it is my will that they shall sit\r\n  with me at the end of time.” Observe how little thou hast gained\r\n  by thy treachery at Northampton; the heat of deceit does not warm\r\n  like fire. If you will compare treachery to fire, feed studiously\r\n  such fire with straw, which ceases to glow as soon as it is burnt\r\n  up, [470] and is consumed almost as soon as kindled. So passeth\r\n  away vanity which hath no roots; rooted truth is not subject to\r\n  vicissitudes: therefore let that alone be permitted thee which is\r\n  lawful, and let not what the double man shall say please thee.\r\n  A prince shall project things which are worthy of a prince:\r\n  therefore take the law under thy protection, which will make thee\r\n  worthy to govern many, worthy of the principality, of the aid of\r\n  many, and of a numerous retinue. And why lovest thou not those\r\n  of whom thou desirest to be king? [480] Thou choosest not to\r\n  profit them, but only to govern. He who seeks only his own glory,\r\n  everything that he governs is ruined by his pride. Thus recently\r\n  the whole which thou governest has been ruined; the glory which\r\n  alone thou soughtest is past.\r\n\r\n  Lo! we are touching the root of the perturbation of the kingdom\r\n  of which we are speaking, and of the dissension of the parties\r\n  who fought the said battle. The objects at which these two\r\n  parties aimed were different. The king, with his, wished thus\r\n  to be free: [490] and so [it was urged on his side] he ought\r\n  to be; and he must cease to be king, deprived of the rights of\r\n  a king, unless he could do whatever he pleased; it was no part\r\n  of the duty of the magnates of the kingdom to determine whom he\r\n  should prefer to his earldoms, or on whom he should confer the\r\n  custody of castles, or whom he would have to administer justice\r\n  to the people, and to be chancellor and treasurer of the kingdom.\r\n  He would have every one at his own will, and counsellors from\r\n  whatever nation he chose, [500] and all ministers at his own\r\n  discretion; while the barons of England are not to interfere with\r\n  the king’s actions, the command of the prince having the force\r\n  of law, and what he may dictate binding upon every body at his\r\n  pleasure. For every earl also is thus his own master, giving to\r\n  every one of his own men both as much as he will, and to whom he\r\n  will; he commits castles, lands, revenues, to whom he will; and\r\n  although he be a subject, the king permits it all. Which, if he\r\n  do well, is profitable to the doer; [510] if not, he must himself\r\n  see to it; the king will not hinder him from injuring himself.\r\n  Why is the prince worse in condition, when the affairs of the\r\n  baron, the knight, and the freeman, are thus managed? Therefore\r\n  they aim at making the king a slave, who wish to diminish his\r\n  power, to take away his dignity of prince; they wish by sedition\r\n  to reduce captive into guardianship and subjection the royal\r\n  power, and to disinherit the king, [520] that he shall be unable\r\n  to reign so fully as hitherto have done the kings who preceded\r\n  him, who were in no respect subjected to their people, but\r\n  administered their own affairs at their will, and conferred what\r\n  they had to confer according to their own pleasure. This is the\r\n  King’s argument, which has an appearance of fairness, and this is\r\n  alleged in defence of the right of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n  But now let my pen turn to the other side:--let me describe the\r\n  object at which the barons aim; and when both sides have been\r\n  heard, let the arguments be compared, [530] and then let us\r\n  come to a final judgment, so that it may be clear which side is\r\n  the truest. The people is more prone to obey the truer party.\r\n  Let therefore the party of the barons speak for itself, and\r\n  proclaim in order by what zeal it is led. Which party in the\r\n  first place protests openly, that it has no designs against the\r\n  kingly honour; nay, it seeks the contrary, and studies to reform\r\n  and magnify the kingly condition; just as if the kingdom were\r\n  ravaged by enemies, [540] then it would not be reformed without\r\n  the barons, who would be the capable and proper persons for this\r\n  purpose; and should any one then hang back, the law would punish\r\n  him as one guilty of perjury, a traitor to the king, who owes\r\n  to his lord, when he is in danger, all the aid he can give to\r\n  support the king’s honour, when the kingdom is as it were nigh\r\n  its end by devastation.\r\n\r\n  The adversaries of the king are enemies who make war upon him,\r\n  and counsellors who flatter the king, who seduce their prince\r\n  with deceitful words, [550] and who lead him into error by their\r\n  double tongues: these are adversaries worse than those who are\r\n  perverse; it is these who pretend to be good whilst they are\r\n  seducers, and procurers of their own advancement; they deceive\r\n  the incautious, whom they render less on their guard by means of\r\n  things that please them, whereby they are not provided against,\r\n  but are considered as prudent advisers. Such men can deceive more\r\n  than those who act openly, as they are able to make an outward\r\n  appearance of being not hostile. What if such wretches, and such\r\n  liars, [560] should haunt the prince, capable of all malice, of\r\n  fraud, of falsehood, excited by the spurs of envy, should seek\r\n  to do that extreme wickedness, by which they should sacrifice\r\n  the privileges of the kingdom to their own ostentation, that\r\n  they should contrive all kinds of hard reasons, which by degrees\r\n  should confound the commonalty, should bruise and impoverish the\r\n  mass of the people, and should subvert and infatuate the kingdom,\r\n  so that no one could obtain justice, [570] except he who would\r\n  encourage the pride of such men as these by large supplies of\r\n  money; who could submit to the establishment of such an injury?\r\n  And if such, by their conduct, should change the state of the\r\n  kingdom; if they should banish justice to put injustice in its\r\n  place; if they should call in strangers and trample upon the\r\n  natives; and if they should subdue the kingdom to foreigners; if\r\n  they should not care for the magnates and nobles of the land, and\r\n  should place contemptible persons over them; and if they should\r\n  overthrow and humiliate the great; [580] if they should pervert\r\n  and turn upside-down the order of things; if they should leave\r\n  the measures that are best, to advance those which are worst;--do\r\n  not those who act thus devastate the kingdom? although they do\r\n  not make war upon it with arms from abroad, yet they fight with\r\n  diabolical arms, and they violate, in a lamentable manner, the\r\n  constitution of the kingdom; although not in the same manner\r\n  [as a foreign enemy], yet they do no less damage. Whether the\r\n  king, seduced to give his consent, not perceiving the design,\r\n  should approve measures so destructive to the kingdom; [590] or\r\n  whether the king should follow such an injurious course with\r\n  an ill design of setting his own power above the laws, abusing\r\n  his strength to please his own will; if thus or otherwise the\r\n  kingdom be wasted, or the kingdom be finally left destitute,\r\n  then the magnates of the kingdom are bound to look to it, that\r\n  the land be purged of all errors. To whom if such a purgation of\r\n  errors belongs, if such a provision belongs to them to regulate\r\n  customs, how can it otherwise than appertain to them [600] to\r\n  look out that no evil may happen which would be injurious?\r\n  Which, after it has happened, they ought to remove, lest by a\r\n  sudden occurrence it give those who do not provide against it\r\n  cause to grieve. Thus, in order that no one of the aforesaid\r\n  things may happen, which may hinder the form of peace and good\r\n  customs, but that the zeal of the experienced men may find what\r\n  is most expedient for the utility of the many, why is a reform\r\n  not admitted, with which no corruption shall be mixed? For the\r\n  king’s clemency and the king’s majesty [610] ought to approve the\r\n  endeavours, which so amend grievous laws that they be milder,\r\n  and that they be, while less onerous, more pleasing to God. For\r\n  the oppression of the commons pleaseth not God, but rather the\r\n  commiseration whereby the commons may have time to think upon\r\n  God. Pharaoh, who so afflicted the people of God, that they could\r\n  with difficulty repair to the oracle which he had appointed to\r\n  Moses, was afterwards so punished, that he was obliged to dismiss\r\n  Israel against his will; and when he thought to catch them after\r\n  they were dismissed, [620] he was drowned whilst he thought to\r\n  run through the deep. Solomon was unwilling to bruise Israel, nor\r\n  would he reduce to servitude any one of the race; because he knew\r\n  that it was God’s people over whom he reigned; and he feared to\r\n  hurt the imprint of God; and he praises mercy more than judgment,\r\n  and the peace of a true father more than execution.\r\n\r\n  Since it is clear that the barons have a right of doing all this,\r\n  it remains to answer the king’s arguments. The king wishes to\r\n  be free by the removal of his guardians, [630] and he will not\r\n  be subject to his inferiors, but be placed over them; he will\r\n  command his subjects and not be commanded; he will be humiliated\r\n  neither to himself nor to those who are his officers. For the\r\n  officers are not set over the king; but on the contrary they are\r\n  rather the noble men who support the law. Otherwise there would\r\n  not be one king of one state, (?) but they would reign equally to\r\n  whom the king was subject. Yet this inconvenience also, though it\r\n  seem so great, with the assistance of God, is easily solved: for\r\n  we believe that God wills truth, [640] through whom we dissolve\r\n  this doubt as follows. He is said to be, and is in truth, one\r\n  king alone, by whom the universe is ruled in pure majesty; who\r\n  neither wants help whereby he may reign, nor even counsel, in as\r\n  much as he cannot err. Therefore, all-powerful and all-knowing,\r\n  he excels in infinite glory all those to whom he has given to\r\n  rule and, as it were, to reign under him over his people, who\r\n  may fail, and who may err, and who cannot avail by their own\r\n  independent strength, [650] and vanquish their enemies by their\r\n  own valour, nor govern kingdoms by their own wisdom, but in an\r\n  evil manner wander in the track of error. They want help which\r\n  should assist them, and counsel which should set them right. Says\r\n  the king, “I agree to thy reasoning; but the choice of these must\r\n  be left to my option; I will associate with myself whom I will,\r\n  by whose support I will govern all things; and if my ministers\r\n  should be insufficient, [660] if they want sense or power, or if\r\n  they harbour evil designs, or are not faithful, but are perhaps\r\n  traitors, I desire that you will explain, why I ought to be\r\n  confined to certain persons, when I might succeed in obtaining\r\n  better assistance?” The reason of this is quickly declared, if it\r\n  be considered what the constraint of the king is: all constraint\r\n  does not deprive of liberty, nor does every restriction take away\r\n  power. Princes desire free power; [670] those who reign decline\r\n  miserable servitude. To what will a free law bind kings?--to\r\n  prevent them from being stained by an adulterated law. And this\r\n  constraint is not one of slavery, but is rather an enlarging of\r\n  the kingly faculty. Thus the king’s child is kept from being\r\n  hurt; yet he is not made a slave when he is thus restricted. Nay,\r\n  the very angels are restricted in this manner, who are confirmed\r\n  from becoming apostates. For, that the Author of all things\r\n  cannot err, [680] that He who is the beginning of all things\r\n  cannot sin, is not impotence, but it is the highest degree of\r\n  power, the great glory of God and his great majesty. Thus, he who\r\n  may fall, if he be kept from falling, so that he may live free\r\n  from danger, he reaps advantage from such keeping, nor is such\r\n  a support slavery, but it is the safeguard of virtue. Therefore\r\n  that there be permitted to a king all that is good, but that he\r\n  dare not do evil,--this is God’s gift. They who keep the king\r\n  from sinning when he is tempted, [690] they serve the king, to\r\n  whom he should be grateful, that they deliver him from being made\r\n  a slave; so that those by whom he is led do not overcome him. But\r\n  he who should be in truth a king, he is truly free if he rule\r\n  rightly himself and the kingdom; let him know that all things are\r\n  permitted him which are in ruling convenient to the kingdom, but\r\n  not such as destroy it. It is one thing to rule according to a\r\n  king’s duty, and another to destroy by resisting the law. The law\r\n  receives its name from binding (_a ligando_), [700] which is so\r\n  perfectly said of liberty, whereby it is served gratefully. (?)\r\n\r\n  Let every king bear in mind that he is a servant of God; let him\r\n  love that only which is pleasing to Him; and let him seek His\r\n  glory in reigning, not his own pride in despising his peers. A\r\n  king who wishes his subject kingdom to yield obedience to him,\r\n  let him render his duty to God in other things truly; let him\r\n  know that obedience is not owing to him who denies the service\r\n  in which he is bound to God. Again, let him know that the people\r\n  is not his but God’s; [710] and that it is profitable to him as\r\n  his help: and that he who for a short period is placed over the\r\n  people, soon, closed in marble, will be buried in the earth.\r\n  Towards them let him make himself as one of them; let him regard\r\n  David joining the dance of the maids. I wish one similar to David\r\n  may succeed the king--a prudent and humble man, who would not\r\n  injure his people; in truth, who would not hurt the people which\r\n  is subjected to him, but would exhibit towards them a loving\r\n  regard, and would aim at their prosperity; [720] the commons\r\n  would not allow him to suffer wrong. It is hard to love one who\r\n  does not love us; it is hard not to despise one who despises us;\r\n  it is hard not to resist one who ruins us; we naturally applaud\r\n  him who favours us. It is not the part of a prince to bruise, but\r\n  to protect; neither is it the part of a prince to oppress, but\r\n  rather to deserve the favour of his people by numerous benefits\r\n  conferred upon them, as Christ by his grace has deserved the\r\n  love of all. If a prince love his subjects, he will necessarily\r\n  be repaid with love; [730] if he reign justly, he will of a\r\n  necessity be honoured; if the prince err, he ought to be recalled\r\n  by those whom his unjust denial may have grieved, unless he be\r\n  willing to be corrected; if he is willing to make amends, he\r\n  ought to be both raised up and aided by these same persons. Let\r\n  a prince maintain such a rule of reigning, that it may never\r\n  be necessary for him to avoid depending on his own people. The\r\n  ignorant princes who confound their subjects, will find that\r\n  those who are unconquered will not thus be tamed. If a prince\r\n  should think [740] that he alone has more truth, more knowledge,\r\n  and more intelligence than the whole people, that he abounds more\r\n  in grace and the gifts of God, if it be not presumption, but it\r\n  be truly so, then his instruction will visit the true hearts\r\n  of his subjects with light, and will instruct his people with\r\n  moderation.\r\n\r\n  We instance Moses, David, Samuel--each of whom we know to have\r\n  been a faithful prince; who suffered many things from their\r\n  subjects, [750] and yet for their deserts they did not cast\r\n  them off, nor set strangers over them, but governed by means\r\n  of those who were their own people. “I will place thee over a\r\n  greater people; and I will slay this people” saith God. “I had\r\n  rather die, than this people should perish,” answered kind Moses,\r\n  who was worthy to govern. And thus a wise prince will never\r\n  reject his people, but an unwise one will disturb the kingdom.\r\n  Wherefore, if a king is less wise than he ought to be, [760]\r\n  what advantage will the kingdom gain by his reign? Is he to seek\r\n  by his own opinion on whom he should depend to have his failing\r\n  supplied? If he alone choose, he will be easily deceived, who\r\n  is not capable of knowing who will be useful. Therefore let the\r\n  community of the kingdom advise; and let it be known what the\r\n  generality thinks, to whom their own laws are best known. Nor are\r\n  all those of the country so uninstructed, as not to know better\r\n  than strangers the customs of their own kingdom, [770] which have\r\n  been bequeathed from father to son. They who are ruled by the\r\n  laws, know those laws best; they who experience them are best\r\n  acquainted with them; and since it is their own affairs which are\r\n  at stake, they will take more care, and will act with an eye to\r\n  their own peace. They who want experience can know little; they\r\n  will profit little the kingdom who are not stedfast. Hence it may\r\n  be collected, that it concerns the community to see what sort of\r\n  men ought justly to be chosen for the utility of the kingdom;\r\n  they who are willing and know how, [780] and are able to profit\r\n  it, such should be made the councillors and coadjutors of the\r\n  king; to whom are known the various customs of their country;\r\n  who feel that they suffer themselves when the kingdom suffers;\r\n  and who guard the kingdom, lest, if hurt be done to the whole,\r\n  the parts have reason to grieve while they suffer along with it;\r\n  which rejoice, when it has cause to rejoice, if they love it.\r\n  Let us call attention to the noble judgment of King Solomon: she\r\n  who did not feel horror at the cruelty of dividing the infant,\r\n  [790] because she did not feel for it, and wanted maternal love,\r\n  shewed, as the king testified, that she was not its mother:\r\n  therefore let a prince seek such [councillors] as may condole\r\n  with the community, who have a motherly fear lest the kingdom\r\n  should undergo any sufferings. But if any one be not moved by\r\n  the ruin of the many--if he alone obtain what pleas he will--he\r\n  is not fitted to rule over the many, since he is entirely\r\n  devoted to his own interest, and to none other. A man who feels\r\n  for others, is agreeable to the community; [800] but a man who\r\n  does not feel for others, who possesses a hard heart, cares not\r\n  if misfortunes fall upon the many--such walls are no defence\r\n  against misfortunes. Therefore, if the king has not wisdom to\r\n  choose by himself those who are capable of advising him, it is\r\n  clear, from what has been said, what ought then to be done. For\r\n  it is a thing which concerns the community to see that miserable\r\n  wretches be not made the leaders of the royal dignity, but the\r\n  best and chosen men, and the most approved that can be found.\r\n  For since the governance of the kingdom is either the safety or\r\n  perdition of all, [810] it is of great consequence who they are\r\n  that have the custody of the kingdom; just as it is in a ship;\r\n  all things are thrown into confusion if unskilful people guide\r\n  it; if any one of the passengers belonging to it who is placed\r\n  in the ship abuse the rudder, it matters not whether the ship\r\n  be governed prosperously or not. So those who ought to rule the\r\n  kingdom, let the care be given to them, if any one of the kingdom\r\n  does not govern himself rightly; he goes on a wrong path which\r\n  perhaps he has himself chosen. The affairs of the generality\r\n  are best managed [820] if the kingdom is directed in the way of\r\n  truth. And, moreover, if the subjects labour to dissipate their\r\n  property, those who are set over them may restrain their folly\r\n  and temerity, lest by the presumption and imbecility of fools,\r\n  the power of the kingdom be weakened, and courage be given to\r\n  enemies against the kingdom. For whatever member of the body\r\n  be destroyed, the strength of the body is diminished thereby.\r\n  So if it be allowed even that men may abuse what belongs to\r\n  themselves, [830] when it be injurious to the kingdom, many\r\n  immediately after following also the injurious liberty, will so\r\n  multiply the wildness of error, that they will ruin the whole.\r\n  Nor ought it properly to be named liberty, which permits fools\r\n  to govern unwisely; but liberty is limited by the bounds of the\r\n  law; and when those bounds are despised, it should be reputed as\r\n  error. Otherwise you will call a raving madman free, although\r\n  he be at enmity with everything like prosperity. Therefore the\r\n  king’s argument concerning his subjects, [840] who are ruled\r\n  at their own choice by whom they will, is by this sufficiently\r\n  answered and overthrown; since every one who is subject, is ruled\r\n  by one who is greater. Because we say that no man is permitted\r\n  all that he will, but that every one has a lord who may correct\r\n  him when erring, and aid him when doing well, and sometimes\r\n  raises him up when he is falling. We give the first place to\r\n  the community: we say also that the law rules over the king’s\r\n  dignity; for we believe that the law is the light, [850] without\r\n  which we conclude that he who rules will wander from the right\r\n  path. The law whereby is ruled the world and the kingdoms of the\r\n  world, is described as being of fire; which contains a mystery\r\n  of deep meaning: it shines, burns, warms; shining, it hinders\r\n  the wanderer from quitting his right path; it avails against the\r\n  cold; it purges and burns to cinders some things; it softens what\r\n  is hard, and what had been raw the fire cooks; it takes away\r\n  numbness, and it does many other good things. The sacred law is\r\n  equally serviceable to the king. Solomon asked for this wisdom;\r\n  [860] its friendship he sought with all his might. If the king\r\n  want this law, he will wander from the right track; if he does\r\n  not hold it, he will err foully; its presence gives the power of\r\n  reigning rightly, and its absence overturns the kingdom. This\r\n  law speaks thus, “Kings reign through me; through me justice is\r\n  shown to those who make laws.” No king shall alter this firm law;\r\n  but by it he shall make himself stable when he is variable. If\r\n  he conform to this law, he will stand; [870] and if he disagree\r\n  with it, he will waver. It is said commonly, “As the king wills,\r\n  so goes the law:” but the truth is otherwise, for the law stands,\r\n  but the king falls. Truth and charity and the zeal of salvation,\r\n  this is the integrity of the law, the regimen of virtue; truth,\r\n  light, charity, warmth, zeal burns; (?) this variety of the law\r\n  takes away all crime. Whatever the king may ordain, let it be\r\n  consonant to these; for if it be otherwise, the commonalty will\r\n  be made sorrowful; the people will be confounded, if either the\r\n  king’s eye want truth, [880] or the prince’s heart want charity,\r\n  or he do not always moderately fulfil his zeal with severity.\r\n\r\n  These three things being supposed, whatever pleases the king\r\n  may be done; but by their opposites the king resists the law.\r\n  However, kicking against it does not hurt the prick; thus the\r\n  instruction which was sent from heaven to Paul teaches us. Thus\r\n  the king is deprived of no inherited right, if there be made a\r\n  provision in concordance with just law. For dissimulation shall\r\n  not change the law, [890] whose stable reason will stand without\r\n  end. Wherefore if anything that is useful has been long put off,\r\n  it is not to be reprehended when adopted late. And let the king\r\n  never set his private interest before that of the community;\r\n  as if the salvation of all yields to him alone. For he is not\r\n  set over them in order to live for himself; but that his people\r\n  who is subject to him may be in safety. You must know that the\r\n  name of king is relative; you should know also that the name is\r\n  protective; wherefore he cannot live for himself alone [900] who\r\n  ought by his life to protect many. He who will live for himself,\r\n  ought not to be set over others, but to live separately from\r\n  them that he may be alone. It is the glory of a prince to save\r\n  very many; to inconvenience himself in order to raise many up.\r\n  Let him not therefore allege his own profit, but have regard to\r\n  his subjects in whom he is trusted. (?) If he work the salvation\r\n  of the kingdom, he acts the part of a king; whatever he does\r\n  contrary to this, he fails in that point. The true province of\r\n  a king is sufficiently clear from these arguments; [910] that\r\n  he is ignorant of the condition of a king who is occupied only\r\n  with his own affairs. For true charity is as it were contrary\r\n  to self-interest, and an indissoluble league to the community,\r\n  melting like fire everything that is near, as is done with wood\r\n  which they subject to the active fire to increase it, and then\r\n  in return it is taken away to decrease it. Therefore if the\r\n  prince will be warm with charity as much as possible towards the\r\n  community, if he shall be solicitous to govern it well, [920] and\r\n  shall never be rejoiced at its destruction; wherefore if the king\r\n  will love the magnates of the kingdom, although he should know\r\n  alone, like a great prophet, whatever is needful for the ruling\r\n  of the kingdom, whatever is becoming in him, whatever ought to be\r\n  done, truly he will not conceal what he will decree from those\r\n  without whom he cannot effect that which he will ordain. He will\r\n  therefore treat with his people about bringing into effect the\r\n  things which he will not think of doing by himself. Why will he\r\n  not communicate his councils [930] to those whose aid he will\r\n  ask supplicatingly? Whatever draws his people to benignity, and\r\n  makes friends and cherishes unity, it is fit the royal prudence\r\n  should indicate it to those who can augment his glory. Our Lord\r\n  laid open all things to his disciples, dividing from the servants\r\n  those whom he made his friends; and as though he were ignorant,\r\n  he often inquired of his people what was their opinion on matters\r\n  which he knew perfectly. Oh! if princes sought the honour of\r\n  God, [940] they would rule their kingdoms rightly, and without\r\n  error. If princes had the knowledge of God, they would exhibit\r\n  their justice to all. Ignorant of the Lord, as though they were\r\n  blind, they seek the praises of men, delighted only with vanity.\r\n  He who does not know how to rule himself, will be a bad ruler\r\n  over others; if any one will look at the Psalms, he will read the\r\n  same. Joseph as he ought to teach princes, (?) on which account\r\n  the king willed that he should be set over others. And David in\r\n  the innocence of his heart [950] and by his intelligence fed\r\n  Israel. From all that has been said, it may appear evident, that\r\n  it becomes a king to see together with his nobles what things\r\n  are convenient for the government of the kingdom, and what are\r\n  expedient for the preservation of peace; and that the king have\r\n  natives for his companions, not foreigners, nor favourites, for\r\n  his councillors or for the great nobles of the kingdom, who\r\n  supplant others and abolish good customs. For such discord is\r\n  a step-mother to peace, [960] and produces battles, and plots\r\n  treason. For as the envy of the devil introduced death, so hatred\r\n  separates the troop. The king shall hold the natives in their\r\n  rank, and by this governance he will have joy in reigning. But if\r\n  he study to degrade his own people, if he pervert their rank, it\r\n  is in vain for him to ask why thus deranged they do not obey him;\r\n  in fact they would be fools if they did.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following Song was written when jealousies and dissensions were\r\nrife among the barons, and some of them began to desert the popular\r\ncause. It is preserved by William de Rishanger, a contemporary,\r\nin his history of the barons’ wars. The defection of the Earl of\r\nGloucester contributed not a little to the disastrous termination\r\nof the career of Simon de Montfort at the battle of Evesham.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG UPON THE DIVISIONS AMONG THE BARONS.\r\n\r\n[MS.

Act now courageously as thou hast promised,\r\n  cherish steadily the cause of which thou wast the fountain.--If,\r\n  from which God preserve us! thou withdrawest thy hand and\r\n  support, acting treacherously towards the land, and inflicting a\r\n  great injury upon it....

In the battle of\r\nEvesham, fought on the fourth of August in the year after that of\r\nLewes, their great leader fell, with the best of his followers. The\r\nfate of Simon de Montfort was a subject of general lamentation; and\r\nlong afterwards he was revered as a saint and martyr, and was even\r\nbelieved to work miracles. In MS. Cotton. Vespas. A. VI. will be\r\nfound a collection of these miracles, and a form of prayers to be\r\nsaid in his honour, among which is the following hymn (fol. 189,\r\nr^o).\r\n\r\n      Salve, Symon Montis-Fortis,\r\n          Totius flos militiæ,\r\n      Duras pœnas passus mortis,\r\n          Protector gentis Angliæ.\r\n      Sunt de sanctis inaudita,\r\n      Cunctis passis in hac vita,\r\n          Quemquam passum talia;\r\n      Manus, pedes amputari,\r\n      Caput, corpus vulnerari,\r\n          Abscidi virilia.\r\n      Sis pro nobis intercessor\r\n      Apud Deum, qui defensor\r\n          In terris extiteras.\r\n\r\nThe whole was preceded by a life of Simon de Montfort, occupying\r\ntwo pages of the manuscript, but which some hostile hand has\r\ncarefully erased. The following song was evidently written\r\nimmediately after the battle of Evesham.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAMENT OF SIMON DE MONTFORT.\r\n\r\n[MS.

Now is slain, etc.\r\n\r\n  But by his death the Earl Montfort gained the victory,--like the\r\n  martyr of Canterbury he finished his life;--the good Thomas would\r\n  not suffer holy Church to perish,--the Earl fought in a similar\r\n  cause, and died without flinching.--Now is slain, &c.\r\n\r\n  Sir Hugh the bold, the Despencer, a very noble justice,--is\r\n  now wrongfully delivered to death, in too shameful a\r\n  manner.--Sir Henry, in truth I say it, the son of the Earl of\r\n  Leicester,--enough of others, as you will hear, by the Earl of\r\n  Gloucester.--Now is slain, etc.\r\n\r\n  Because they were willing to die, and to maintain peace and\r\n  right,--the holy martyr will cause them to enjoy his pure\r\n  conscience,--who is willing to die and to sustain the men of\r\n  the land,--to accomplish his good desire, for we think he does\r\n  well.--Now is, etc.\r\n\r\n  Near his body, the good treasure, an heir they found,--the false\r\n  ribalds, they were so wicked, and those who slew him;--what was\r\n  much worse, they caused the worthy man to be dismembered,--who\r\n  knew so well the art of fighting and of holding faith.--Now is,\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n  Pray all, my sweet friends, to the Son of St. Mary,--that he lead\r\n  in good life the infant, the powerful heir;--I will not name the\r\n  scholar, I do not desire any one to mention him,--but for the\r\n  love of the Saviour, pray for the clergy.--Now is slain, etc.\r\n\r\n  I cannot find any thing that they did well, neither baron nor\r\n  earl,--the knights and the esquires are all disgraced,--on\r\n  account of their loyalty and truth, which is entirely\r\n  annihilated;--the deceitful man may reign, the fool for his\r\n  folly.--Now is slain, etc.\r\n\r\n  Sir Simon, the worthy man, and his company,--are gone in joy up\r\n  to heaven, in everlasting life.--But Jesus Christ, who placed\r\n  himself on the cross, and God have care of those,--who are\r\n  remitted, and detained in hard prison.--Now is slain, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF EDWARD I. 1272-1307.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry outlived the defeat of the barons but a very few years. He\r\ndied on the sixteenth of November, 1272, while his son Edward was\r\noccupied in warring against the infidels in the East. Edward was\r\nproclaimed king, while absent. A new monarch is generally welcomed\r\nwith songs of praise; and the following, evidently the work of a\r\nzealous opponent of the popular party, seems to have been written\r\nbefore his arrival in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRAISE OF THE YOUNG EDWARD.\r\n\r\n[MS.

He, while yet in his tender youth, went through many\r\n  conflicts with a manly heart. Warlike as a pard, fragrant with\r\n  sweetness like spikenard, whilst Edward is in his vigour, behold\r\n  he shines like a new Richard. Thus the Britons have a double\r\n  claim to honour, by the wars of Edward equally and by the valour\r\n  of Richard. France praised the manners of the warlike youth; the\r\n  ample hand of the giver amassed merited honours. The envious\r\n  people desiring to extinguish his merited praise, began to weave\r\n  new plots in their mind: the English nobles, by inventing a new\r\n  law, made a wretched land of a rich kingdom. The king his father,\r\n  and his uncle, with their two children, are governed by their\r\n  subjects, out of which many evils follow. The degenerate race of\r\n  the English, which used to serve, inverting the order of things,\r\n  ruled over the king and his children. The people conspires, in\r\n  order to enjoy a new law; soon after, the league being broken,\r\n  horrid wars arise. While the populace associated with itself the\r\n  Earl of Leicester, it accumulated for itself internal exhaustion.\r\n  The impious people attacks its own king, makes captive the son\r\n  with his father and uncle, next seizes upon the government;\r\n  the victors rejoice, their hearts swell. Edward escapes, and\r\n  immediately new battles follow. He calls together assistance,\r\n  leagues are established, the army of the leader increased, the\r\n  deluded troop laments its crimes. The parties meet; weapons are\r\n  clashed; the fields are moistened with blood by the vigour of\r\n  the soldier Edward. The Earl is slain by the sword; the barons\r\n  are put to death with the weapon’s point; thus the vanquished\r\n  conquer, and the conquerors are overcome. Although by sedition\r\n  almost robbed of his own kingdom, he overcame the conquering\r\n  legions by a wonderful effort. The noble offspring carried back\r\n  his father to the government of the kingdom, wickedly wrested\r\n  from him, which he had long ruled. The conquered populace roars,\r\n  and again joins its warlike squadrons to the barons; fortifies\r\n  towns with provisions and weapons. Soon after the isle of Ely\r\n  is ravaged by the popular leaders. London, the capital city of\r\n  our kingdom, is occupied by some, and is shaken with fearful\r\n  strife; but all these difficulties are conquered with wonderful\r\n  strength. Peace, wished for, returns; the arms are laid by;\r\n  clouds have given place to sunshine; the joys of the English\r\n  increase. The active Edward, flying from idleness, next took up\r\n  the sign of the cross, desirous of performing a worthy service\r\n  to Christ, who had delivered him from this whirlwind of wars;\r\n  a pious troop of men follows. The King of Sicily, brother of\r\n  the King of France, had conducted a vast host to the kingdom of\r\n  Tunis, that he might recover the tribute which had been refused,\r\n  saying that this would be a safe way for the whole army to the\r\n  Holy Land; the people which was signed with the cross lamented to\r\n  see its object thus unpropitiously changed. Edward follows in the\r\n  belief that there will be powerful fighting with the Saracens;\r\n  but the Gentile King wisely avoiding battle, paid whatever he\r\n  asked. King Louis dies with his eldest son; France lamented;\r\n  King Charles returns, and brings back the troops, the English\r\n  with the Sicilians; the anxious Britons wept. The King of Sicily\r\n  wickedly broke his vow of crusading, and the people, deceived,\r\n  lamented his changing. He arrives at the port of Trapeni; soon\r\n  a whirlwind from the north strikes the fleet; multitudes of\r\n  people perish; all the money is sunk; but the English fleet is\r\n  providentially saved, without losing the value of a farthing.\r\n  The king refuses to proceed, or to perform his vow. The pious\r\n  leader of the English and all his company alike embark, pass the\r\n  sea, and make for the places which were besieged by the Gentiles,\r\n  pressed under a long lasting storm. Acre takes breath, rejoicing\r\n  in such a soldier, and rises as it were from the grave to sing\r\n  new songs of praise. The Soldan was enraged, and thought to slay\r\n  the noble leader, whom he caused to be stabbed by a detestable\r\n  butcher. This assassin brought pretended messages from the Old\r\n  Man of the Mountain, which were but false pretences; he enters\r\n  the chamber and shuts the door; with a knife he adds wound upon\r\n  wound; but Edward, on the other hand, resisted strenuously; with\r\n  his strength he laid prostrate the murderer, whom he slew with a\r\n  merited death by his own weapon. And because Christ knew that his\r\n  servant was worthy, he healed his wounds with a sacred medicine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPopular dissatisfaction may be traced throughout Edward’s reign, we\r\nmay venture to say from the day in which he mounted the throne. The\r\nfollowing song seems to have been popular soon after his accession;\r\nand it is written in Latin and Anglo-Norman, in order that it might\r\nbe sung more generally. In the manuscript, each stanza of the Latin\r\nis followed by the corresponding stanza in Anglo-Norman. Between\r\nthe Latin lines of the first stanza is left space apparently for\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SONG ON THE TIMES.\r\n\r\n[From MS.

The fraud of the rulers prevails,\r\n  peace is trodden under foot; faith fettered in prison is very\r\n  desolate.--At present, a writing is of no use; but right and\r\n  law lie as it were asleep, and the care of the wicked race is\r\n  blind, it has not sufficient foresight to fear the future.--The\r\n  sons of iniquity crush those who resist; the peace of the church\r\n  perishes, and the proud reign. The wicked prelates support this\r\n  state of things by their supineness, for they refuse to suffer\r\n  death for justice.--Peace being altogether overthrown, love is\r\n  cooled; all the land of England is moist with weeping, and all\r\n  friendship and kindness has disappeared; all seek consolation\r\n  and quiet.--The little orphans lament the loss of their father,\r\n  and, deprived of their mother, they sorrow in the midst of\r\n  hunger; they who at first were very powerful, now fall by the\r\n  sword, and their parents weep.--Lo! wicked children rob the\r\n  poor; lo! the wealth of the rich is increased by exacting gifts;\r\n  almost all the nobles spend their time in contriving evil; the\r\n  mad esquires delight in malice.--Lo! the rapacious men appear\r\n  on every side; lo! the supporters of peace and justice perish;\r\n  these cruel butchers despise doctrine, and the holy preachers\r\n  have no effect.--These men will not be amended by the force of\r\n  sermons; nor do they make any account of the lives of men; they\r\n  all plunder together, like robbers. Take vengeance upon them, O\r\n  God of vengeance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the legacies which St. Louis left to Christendom was the\r\nnumber of new orders of monks which had been created during his\r\nreign and by his encouragement. They soon spread from France into\r\nEngland; but they were very far from being popular in either\r\ncountry, and were the constant butt of the gibes and jokes of\r\nthe poets. The following is a bitter satire upon the different\r\norders of monks in England in the reign of Edward I. The idea of\r\ncaricaturing them by feigning one order which should unite the\r\ndifferent characteristic vices of all the others, was not new.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER OF FAIR-EASE.\r\n\r\n[MS. Harl.

The Order is so cleverly founded, that it takes a point\r\n  from all the other orders; there is not an order in this world,\r\n  of which there is not there some one point. The name of the Order\r\n  I will tell you, that I may not be blamed for what I read; he\r\n  who will hear, let him be silent, it is the Order of Fair-Ease.\r\n  Of this Order I will tell you the sum; for in the order is many\r\n  a worthy fellow, and many a fair and good dame. In this Order\r\n  there are without blame, esquires, valets, and serjeants; but\r\n  to ribalds and to peasants the Order is entirely forbidden,\r\n  so that no one may be received into it. For they would bring\r\n  disgrace upon the Order. When ribald or vilein mounts to high\r\n  place or office, there where he can have power, there is no more\r\n  moderation in them than in the wolf which devours lambs. Of such\r\n  people I will say no more, but I will go on to talk about the\r\n  Order.\r\n\r\n  In this Order of which I tell you, it is first ordained thus,\r\n  that those who shall belong to the Order, shall have one point\r\n  of Sempringham, which will be very agreeable, as the Abbey of\r\n  Sempringham has, brothers and sisters together; it is a good\r\n  Order, as it seems to me. But so far, in truth, it is changed,\r\n  that at Sempringham there must be between the brothers and the\r\n  sisters (a thing which displeases many,) ditches and walls of\r\n  high measure; but in this Order of Fair-Ease there must be\r\n  neither ditch nor wall, nor any other impediment, to hinder\r\n  the brethren at their pleasure from visiting the sisters, nor\r\n  shall there be any watch-word. Their intimacy shall neither be\r\n  separated by linen nor wool, or even by their very skins. From\r\n  thence also it is provided, that they who shall enter the Order,\r\n  must be well entertained by the abbot: and this our master\r\n  commands, to eat well and plentifully three times a day, and\r\n  oftener. And if they do it for company, the Order on that account\r\n  shall not be the worse.\r\n\r\n  Of Beverley they have taken a point, which shall be kept well\r\n  and accurately, to drink well at their meat, and then afterwards\r\n  until supper; and afterwards at the collation, each must have\r\n  a piece of candle as long as the arm below the elbow, and as\r\n  long as there shall remain a morsel of the candle to burn, the\r\n  brethren must continue their drinking.\r\n\r\n  A point they have taken from the Hospitallers, who are very\r\n  courteous knights, and have very becoming robes, so long that\r\n  they drag at their feet; shoes and breeches which fit elegantly,\r\n  and great palfreys that amble well; so in our Order, in truth,\r\n  the brethren and sisters must have them.\r\n\r\n  Of the Canons they have taken a point, which will agree well\r\n  with the Order; for the canons, for great pain, eat in the\r\n  refectory flesh three days in the week; so must our sisters and\r\n  our brethren eat flesh in the refectory every day, except only\r\n  Friday, and likewise Saturday. And if it so happen that there be\r\n  a fast on the Saturday, and they have not plenty of fish, they\r\n  may have leave to take what provisions are in the house; the\r\n  Order will be none the worse for it.\r\n\r\n  A point they have taken from the Black Monks, that they love\r\n  drinking, forsooth, and are drunk every day, for they do not know\r\n  any other way of living. But they do it for the sake of society,\r\n  and not at all out of gluttony. Also it is provided, that each\r\n  brother drink before dinner and after. And if it so happen that\r\n  a friend visit a brother (for such must be at hand to solace\r\n  the brethren) who shall know how to play in the evening; this I\r\n  tell you for certain, he shall sleep late in the morning, until\r\n  the evil fumes are issued from his head, for great danger of the\r\n  sight.\r\n\r\n  Of the Secular Canons, who willingly serve ladies, our masters\r\n  have taken a point, and will that this point be well observed\r\n  and well used; for know that this point is more needful than\r\n  any in the Order, in order to solace the brethren. And so it\r\n  is commanded very straightly, on pain of excommunication,\r\n  that the brethren be constant companions of the sisters, both\r\n  before matins and after, so that the brethren be not blamed for\r\n  neglecting them, nor the Order receive discredit.\r\n\r\n  The Grey Monks are a hard race; yet, nevertheless, from their\r\n  order our masters will that the Order have one of their points\r\n  for mortification; and in fact it is not over courteous,--for\r\n  they go to matins without breeches. So ought our brethren to do,\r\n  to be more at their ease. And when they make no prayer, they must\r\n  be on their knees, to have greater and more effectual devotion:\r\n  and they ring with one bell, and no more,--it is their order\r\n  and usage:--but our brethren, to double it, must sound with two\r\n  bells. Our Order has such difference, that our sisters must\r\n  lay down flat and pray on their backs, they do it out of great\r\n  devotion.\r\n\r\n  Also they take in patience, it is a point from the Order of\r\n  Silence; each is a good order, without doubt, but none of the\r\n  others is so valuable;--therefore they will take one point of\r\n  this order for our purpose. Each is shut up in his cell, to\r\n  repose himself alone; so our brothers must be, and each at his\r\n  window must have some plants to comfort him, and his sister in\r\n  his arms, and he must be shut up privately, that nobody may\r\n  disturb them.\r\n\r\n  We must not forget, if our Order is to last, the Friars Minors,\r\n  in no case; so must we have a point of their order, to be of more\r\n  account. Their order is founded in poverty, therefore they go the\r\n  open way to heaven completely; and I will tell you exactly how\r\n  they seek poverty always; when they travel through the country,\r\n  they take up their lodgings with the chief baron or knight,\r\n  or with the chief person or priest, there where they can be\r\n  satiated; but, by St. Peter of Rome! they will never lodge with\r\n  a poor man,--so long as there are richer men to be found, they\r\n  prefer asking a lodging of them. In the same manner our brethren\r\n  must not take up their lodging, nor seek other place, than where\r\n  they know there is plenty, and there they ought in charity to eat\r\n  flesh and whatever they find, as the Friars Minors do.\r\n\r\n  As we owe something to the Minors, we will borrow also of the\r\n  Preachers; they do not go bare-foot like the others, but they\r\n  go preaching with shoes on, and if it happen any time that they\r\n  have sore feet, they may, if they like, ride on horseback at\r\n  their ease all the day long. But quite in another manner ought\r\n  our brethren to do, when they preach through the land; for they\r\n  must ride thus always both far and near: and when they make any\r\n  sermon, they must be within doors. And always after dinner they\r\n  ought rightly to preach; for many a man is of such a character,\r\n  that his heart is harder than stone; but when he shall have once\r\n  drunk, then as soon as he has heard the Order, and the hearts\r\n  shall be moistened, however little they might have heard, they\r\n  will listen to the Order, when they have heard the sermon.\r\n\r\n  Thus is our Order founded, and our brothers have deemed right,\r\n  that each county must have an abbot, who has power to receive\r\n  sisters and brothers, and make and hold full orders, and that\r\n  the points shall be held which our masters have provided. A\r\n  provincial ought to go and inquire in the land, to know who will\r\n  hold the Order. And he who shall break it, shall be chastised\r\n  in private, and reproved for his trespass. And those who shall\r\n  be found to have made good use of the order, must, for their\r\n  humility, be raised to dignity, and they shall be abbots or\r\n  priors to hold the order in honours. Thus do the Augustine\r\n  Monks, who know so many devices; every where they give full\r\n  encouragement to those who hold the Order loyally, and those who\r\n  will hold the Order shall be praised everywhere.\r\n\r\n  Now ends our Order, which agrees with all good orders, and it is\r\n  the Order of Fair-Ease, which to many may it please too well!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEdward endeavoured to call off the vigour of his subjects from\r\ndomestic sedition to foreign wars. But the expenses dependent\r\nupon the latter only added to the many burdens under which the\r\nEnglish peasantry laboured; and it is now that we begin to find the\r\ncomplaints of the latter vented in the shape of popular songs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG OF THE HUSBANDMAN.\r\n\r\n[MS.

gone,--they keep here no saying and sing no\r\n  song.--Now we must work, there is no other custom,--I can no\r\n  longer live with my gleaning;--yet there is a bitterer asking for\r\n  the boon,--for ever the fourth penny must [go] to the king.\r\n\r\n  Thus we complain for the king, and care full coldly,--and think\r\n  to recover, and ever are cast;--he who hath any goods, expects\r\n  not to keep them,--but ever the dearest we lose at last.\r\n\r\n  It is grievous to lose, where there is little,--and we have many\r\n  fellows who expect it;--the hayward commandeth us harm to have\r\n  of his;--the bailiff causeth us to know evil, and thinks to do\r\n  well;--the woodward has woe in keeping for us, who looketh under\r\n  branches;--there may not arise to us or remain with us riches or\r\n  repose.--Thus they rob the poor man, who is of little value:--he\r\n  must needs in sweat and in labour waste away so.\r\n\r\n  He must needs pine away, though he had swore (?),--that hath not\r\n  a hood to hide his head.--Thus will walketh in the land, and law\r\n  is destroyed,--and all the pride of the rider is picked from the\r\n  poor.\r\n\r\n  Thus they rob the poor and pick him full clean,--the rich\r\n  lord it without any right;--their lands and their people lay\r\n  full lean,--through asking of bailifs such harm has befallen\r\n  them.--Many of religion hold them full abject,--baron and\r\n  bond-man, the clerk and the knight.--Thus will walks in the land,\r\n  and consternation is frequent,--falsehood fattens and marrs with\r\n  might.\r\n\r\n  He stands full in the place, and holds him full sternly,--that\r\n  makes beggars go with bordon and bags.--Thus we are hunted from\r\n  hall to corner;--they who once wore robes, now wear rags.\r\n\r\n  Still there come beadles, with very great boast,--“Prepare me\r\n  silver for the green wax:--thou art entered in my writing, that\r\n  thou knowest well of.”--More than ten times I paid my tax.--Then\r\n  must I have hens roasted,--fair on the fish day lamprey and\r\n  salmon;--forth to the market gains not cost,--though I sell my\r\n  bill and my borstax.\r\n\r\n  I must lay my pledge well if I will,--or sell my corn while it is\r\n  but green grass.--Yet I shall be a foul churl, though they have\r\n  the whole,--what I have saved all the year, I must spend then.\r\n\r\n  I must needs spend what I saved formerly,--I must thus take care\r\n  against the time these catchpoles come;--the master beadle comes\r\n  as roughly as a boar,--he says he will make my lodgings full\r\n  bare;--I must give him for meed a mark or more,--though I sell\r\n  my mare at the day fixed.--There the green wax grieveth us under\r\n  garment,--so that they hunt us as a hound doth the hare.\r\n\r\n  They hunt us as a hound doth a hare on the hill;--since I took to\r\n  the land such hurt was given me:--the beadles have never asked\r\n  their ...,--for they may scape, and we are always caught.\r\n\r\n  Thus I take and catch cares full cold,--since I reckoning\r\n  and cot had to keep;--to seek silver for the king, I sold\r\n  my seed,--wherefore my land lies fallow and learneth to\r\n  sleep.--Since they fetched my fair cattle in my fold,--when\r\n  I think of my weal I very nearly weep;--thus breed many bold\r\n  beggars,--and our rye is rotted and ... before we reap.\r\n\r\n  ... is our rye and rotted in the straw,--on account of the\r\n  bad weather by brook and by brink.--There wakes in the world\r\n  consternation and woe,--as good is to perish at once as so to\r\n  labour.\r\n\r\n

The following song,\r\nattributed in the several manuscripts to different writers, was (if\r\nwe may judge by the number of copies which remain,) very popular.\r\nDifferent persons seem, from time to time, to have altered it and\r\nadded to it. It appears to have been composed in 1298, soon after\r\nthe sanguinary battle of Falkirk; but the latter stanzas, found\r\nonly in one manuscript, have apparently been added at a somewhat\r\nlater period.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG ON THE SCOTTISH WARS.\r\n\r\n[MS.

Unless the vessel be\r\n  clean, whatever you pour in becomes soured.--In order, therefore,\r\n  that the minds of the wicked may be soured, I will relate what\r\n  I have learnt of the deeds of the English. Henceforward I will\r\n  not fear the words of the envious. If you live well, you need\r\n  not care for what evil men say.]--It is the property of wicked\r\n  men always to say evil, to detract from the able, to respect\r\n  the vile. I am unwilling that you should be disturbed by the\r\n  fear of such men; it is praiseworthy in the prudent to be abused\r\n  by the wicked.--For the wicked are displeased by rectitude of\r\n  life: the law is injured in them, and they esteem strife as a\r\n  joke. The repose of ribalds is inquietude; to attempt to convert\r\n  fools is, as it were, to put cold iron on the anvil.--Every one\r\n  strikes cold iron, who counsels the obstinate man to desert his\r\n  sins; for the wise man says very sensibly, “he sows words in the\r\n  wind who preaches to a madman.”--Every where are preached the\r\n  fraudulent actions of the faithless men, who molest England by\r\n  force of arms; the French, Scotch, and Welsh, whose power may the\r\n  Omnipotent who holds the world repress!--May the Governor of the\r\n  universe whom we address as God, who protected the Hebrew people\r\n  through many difficulties, give the English victory over their\r\n  enemies! The butler can furnish liquor to a thousand men.--As the\r\n  butler at will gives drink to many, so the Lord gives strength\r\n  at his will to those whom he has chosen; Edward the noble\r\n  King knows this; and he labours to devote himself entirely to\r\n  Christ.--Edward our King is entirely devoted to Christ; he is\r\n  quick to pardon, and slow to vengeance; he puts to flight his\r\n  adversaries like a leopard; the reputation of the fool stinks,\r\n  the just man smells sweet as spikenard.--Like spikenard smells\r\n  the fame of the King of the English, who represses the attempts\r\n  of his enemies; him let all the enemies of the English fear:\r\n  often the mastiff snatches the sheep from the wolves’ jaws.--In\r\n  the wolves’ jaws the English have been of late; for, when all the\r\n  turbulent chiefs of Wales were reduced, the Scotch raise their\r\n  spears armed in their rags: a few years exhibit the wonderful\r\n  fortune of John.--John being now King of Scotland, clement and\r\n  chaste, governing the kingdom as though he had been bred a king,\r\n  him at length the pride of his nation deposed. The first-created\r\n  was an exile, driven from his pious seat.--He, however, was\r\n  deservedly exiled, for, as I have read, he promised homage to the\r\n  English King; afterwards he declined the verb _frango_ (I break);\r\n  by breaking all which I had promised, (said he,) I performed\r\n  my agreement.--The aforesaid prince broke his promise, when he\r\n  did not restrain the attempts of the wicked; a voice was heard\r\n  in Rama, weeping and lamentation; a remiss master makes lazy\r\n  servants.--By slack servants the King is dishonoured; holiness\r\n  is overthrown, the law is made of no avail; there is frequent\r\n  sedition, the peace is endangered. Cursed be the house, where\r\n  every dependent is master!--When the dependant commands, and the\r\n  prince is a servant, then the state is in danger, and quietness\r\n  departs. O how many people impiety, when unpunished, injures!\r\n  The impious man unpunished always thinks that he conquers.--The\r\n  twelve rulers of Scotland thought that they could resist the\r\n  great valour of the English; therefore many of them fell by\r\n  the sword. Said the toad to the harrow, “cursed be so many\r\n  rulers!”--Many rulers under such a diminutive leader conspire\r\n  against the English, whilst the king was at peace; at length\r\n  they meet with standards raised. Great rivers take their rise\r\n  from a small fountain.--From small fountains great rivers arise;\r\n  so it is with the wanton attempts of the people of Scotland.\r\n  Many thereupon are led captives: whenever the kings run wild, it\r\n  is the subjects who suffer.--The subject populace perished in\r\n  battle at Dunbar, where the Scotch were slain by the flail of\r\n  the English. You might see the carcases, as in the shambles of\r\n  a seller of refuse meat, cut off from the kilted rabble.--The\r\n  kilted people, numerous and savage, who are accustomed to detract\r\n  from the Englishmen, fell at Dunbar, and now stink like a dog:\r\n  thus do fools, who are tormented by vain glory.--Vain glory made\r\n  the deceitful people deny the true lord of Scotland; but after\r\n  the battle they seek peace. Sometimes fortune makes a wise man of\r\n  a fool.--He is wise in battle who yields to his superior; but the\r\n  wild people of Scotland soon break their faith. No one can take\r\n  away what nature gave: the disease which is rooted in the bone,\r\n  can seldom be expelled from the flesh.--The noble king departed,\r\n  sparing so great a mass of populace; he traversed Scotland with a\r\n  crowd of attendants. The English fortify castles, by the king’s\r\n  command; for that hurts less which we have provided against.--The\r\n  wars are governed by the king’s providence; the Scottish nobles\r\n  are subdued to the English; judges are appointed, the laws\r\n  are revised; for the laws themselves require to be regulated\r\n  aright.--The king appointed a worthy man to the government of\r\n  the kingdom, John de Warenne, whom he had often proved. He to\r\n  the utmost of his power observed the laws; destroying the proud,\r\n  he placed the humble in peace.--The king, after these things had\r\n  been performed, returned in peace, preparing to aid gratuitously\r\n  the Count of Flanders; he prepares a great fleet as quickly as\r\n  he can; banish delay, to those who are prepared it is always\r\n  injurious to procrastinate.--Nor was there any delay, for the\r\n  cunning Scots meet together; with their hands on the gospels,\r\n  they have said that from their station in the south they will not\r\n  pass the Trent: little is owing to pleasure, more to safety.--The\r\n  Scottish nobles all swear with alacrity, and their boundaries\r\n  are limited to each by the king; see that they be not perjured,\r\n  and fall into the net; for the poets sing wonderful things that\r\n  are not to be believed.--Then the king, wonderfully credulous\r\n  in them, passed the sea, and powerfully warred against the\r\n  French in Flanders; unmindful of old age, he was not terrified\r\n  by numbers. He flourishes by counsel, to whom nature has denied\r\n  strength.--The Lord has not denied strength and vigour to the\r\n  king, whom he ordained to be the flower of the world; whose\r\n  acts excite everybody’s wonder; for his mind is capable of\r\n  undergoing every labour.--A new labour arises; Satan is raised\r\n  up; the fidelity of the Scots disappears entirely; the valour\r\n  of the English is undeservedly set at nought. What everybody\r\n  says, does not rest upon our opinion.--The abandoned scoffers\r\n  hold mutual conversations; “Lo! triumphant garlands are given to\r\n  the English. O William de Wallace! send us to them: arrows can\r\n  penetrate the hard mail.--Let us call together all our archers;\r\n  let us hasten together against the Guardian of Scotland. For it\r\n  is right that we should fight for our country: we often see the\r\n  conqueror overcome by the vanquished.”--Accordingly the Guardian\r\n  of Scotland is very hard pressed; and the people assemble at\r\n  Stirling, proud in spirit; treachery destroys the English, and\r\n  they are on the brink of ruin: the end does not correspond with\r\n  the beginning.--The Earl, who was leader of the English, first\r\n  passed the bridge, penetrating boldly into the Scotish columns;\r\n  but he was driven back by treachery, and not by the force of\r\n  arms: fraud is often the cause of many evils.--Fraud caused the\r\n  English to blush, whilst they saw on all sides the blood of their\r\n  own people flowing; Levenax and Richard Lundi are convicted of\r\n  fraud. How short is the joy, and how lasting the sorrow, of the\r\n  world!--O perfidiousness of the world! who is not astonished by\r\n  thee? Treachery lies hid, concealed among our household; the\r\n  cunning man is always opposed to the peaceful; the shepherd\r\n  leads his sheep with a staff, the wolf threatens them with his\r\n  mouth.--What does the barbarous brutal and foolish race threaten?\r\n  Will this perfidy remain unavenged? The King of England will\r\n  come with open force, inquiring much about Priam and much about\r\n  Hector.--The proud people raise a heap of evils for themselves,\r\n  provoking the English to the bitter contest; words will cease,\r\n  when the blows come; though you think you have finished entirely,\r\n  there is a snake concealed in the grass.--[“The sun,” they say,\r\n  “will not be concealed from us with his light; the time is come\r\n  when the English will all fall by our hands; no one....” The\r\n  Divine power plays with the prospects of men.--O power of God!\r\n  I petition thee in favour of thy people! come with a propitious\r\n  countenance to the aid of the English; judge the king’s cause,\r\n  and give him grace: thou who art without beginning, do not let\r\n  falseness triumph.]--After this the leader of the plot calls\r\n  together his party, knowing that our king would be gone over the\r\n  sea; he made an order to ravage Northumberland: “we oft see,”\r\n  says he, “weeping after joy.”--Northumberland, much desolated,\r\n  may weep! She is made as a widow robbed of her children. Vescy,\r\n  Morley, Somerville, Bertram are dead: Alas! of how many, and\r\n  how great men in every part is she widowed!--In her, since she\r\n  is a widow, the troops of the Scots reduce the estates of many\r\n  to cinders. William Wallace is the leader of these savages; the\r\n  rejoicings of fools breed increase of griefs.--To increase the\r\n  wickedness which they had hitherto perpetrated, these wicked\r\n  men deliver Alnwick to the flames; they run about on every side\r\n  like madmen. Few are chosen, but many are called.--Many ask\r\n  each other how it happened, that the Newminster was not touched\r\n  by the fire. The monks promise gifts, but they do not fulfil\r\n  their promise: as there was need, so was the thing carried into\r\n  effect.--On this account they led away captive the prior of the\r\n  monastery, whom they then found; having carried away the goods,\r\n  they left the houses empty. Few are munificent, but there are\r\n  many who seek after gifts.--Now the malignant people returns to\r\n  Scotland; and the honour of knighthood is given to William; from\r\n  a robber he becomes a knight, just as a swan is made out of a\r\n  raven; an unworthy man takes the seat, when a worthy man is not\r\n  by.--At length a letter reaches the worthy prince, in which the\r\n  whole course of events is told. Let nobody be surprized if he was\r\n  enraged at it: the sea cannot be quiet when the storm rages.--In\r\n  his anger he began thus to address his knights: “Again you must\r\n  prepare to fight for your country. I would rather conquer once,\r\n  than be often tormented; wars are better than being troubled\r\n  with lasting strife.”--“Do not be troubled,” said they, “if the\r\n  Scottish thieves sharpen axes for their own heads; one Englishman\r\n  will slay very many Scots. It is not the part of a man who has\r\n  a beard to join mice to a little cart.”--Wallace, or Gilmaurus,\r\n  is scarcely better than a mouse, to whose victory the laurel\r\n  will never grow; for they want strength and treasure: a bull\r\n  who has lost his horns is the more eager for the war.--On St.\r\n  Magdalen’s day the wretches fall in battle; the king subdues\r\n  in the field near a hundred thousand; the meadows are covered\r\n  with their carcases. The wicked hate sin from the fear of\r\n  punishment.--Scared by the fear of punishment the tyrant turns\r\n  his back, whom the short jacket once pleased; faithless in the\r\n  day of battle he flies like a truant. One day often gives what\r\n  the whole year denies.--In one day many wretches were slain; and\r\n  the English pursue the Scots who had fled; they are transfixed\r\n  with spears, and robbed of their clothes. The white thorns are\r\n  cut down, while the black bilberries are gathered.--Wallace, thy\r\n  reputation as a soldier is lost; since thou didst not defend thy\r\n  people with the sword, it is just thou shouldst now be deprived\r\n  of thy dominion.\r\n\r\n  But, in my view, thou wilt always be the ass thou wert\r\n  formerly.--Thou wilt pass into a lasting proverb; thy kingdom\r\n  is divided, and cannot stand; thy people now drink of the cup\r\n  which thou hast prepared. He who turns others into derision,\r\n  will not escape being derided.--O laughable thing, that has\r\n  been manifested in our time! Fortune will play in various ways.\r\n  The prince has been turned into an outcast, Judah into Jebus.\r\n  The Divine power plays with the prospects of men.--Things being\r\n  brought to this pass, the king searches the country, and hunts\r\n  the thieves out of their hiding places; every one who is found\r\n  is put to the sword: justice requires this, that the punishment\r\n  come after the fault.--[Next the king returns, that he may\r\n  marry Queen Margaret, the flower of the French; through her the\r\n  kingdoms receive a more complete peace. Anger begets slaughter,\r\n  concord nourishes love.--When love buds between great princes,\r\n  it drives away bitter sobs from their subjects; and now a firm\r\n  peace is negotiated by frequent messengers: for by these things\r\n  grace makes people friends.--It is just that the Scots should\r\n  have a small portion of grace, because the impious people have\r\n  neither peace nor quiet of mind. Comyn, Carrick, Umfraville raise\r\n  their standards: there is nothing more sharp than envy, nor more\r\n  wicked.--The nation, voluntarily wicked, will not be obedient;\r\n  it forces the illustrious king with his army to return; now they\r\n  fear who neglect to come to peace, lest they perish languishingly\r\n  by the sword of dire death.--Let them perish utterly both fathers\r\n  and sons; unless they quickly give their feet to flight, flying\r\n  they desert their towns and houses: the child Ganymedes drives\r\n  about the hares on mount Ida.--In the midst of these transactions\r\n  the King of France, sending without delay, asks an honourable\r\n  truce of the King of England. The king accedes to his request,\r\n  soon afterwards turning his reins: the grateful hour will arrive\r\n  when it is least expected.--Who knows not that that would be\r\n  the best hour for the Scots, in which the sword ceases from the\r\n  weeping commonalty, and the king unites and honours the nobles.\r\n  While it is warm and fair weather, the ant labours.--After\r\n  all these warlike labours, the English like angels are always\r\n  conquerors, they are more excellent than the Scotch and Welsh;\r\n  you will learn people’s manners by contemplating their lives.--As\r\n  though a swine should resist the valour of the lion, so the\r\n  filthy Scots attack England; and the king for that reason reduces\r\n  them to slavery: he will ever be a slave, who cannot be content\r\n  with the little which Providence has given him.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following verses seem to have been written immediately after\r\nJohn Baliol had retired to Normandy, in 1290.

The\r\n  Scot, hoping to be defended in battle by the new spear of the\r\n  French, is waiting for their power. The Scots rejoice together\r\n  in the belief that they will have the better in the war by the\r\n  aid of the French; they rebel, and haste to fight. France will\r\n  profit little the Scot in the field. Why has the Scot been beaten\r\n  in three battles? By the fourth battle the Scots are reduced to\r\n  extremities: such as they are and will ever be, very many songs\r\n  tell. He who learnt songs conquered Troy in battle; Ovid has\r\n  told us what was the cause of it. After the war, Troy was barren\r\n  of maidens; when the rebellion is over, so will Scotland be of\r\n  Scots. Troy is ravaged by war, the land near about being full of\r\n  camps, it is with its boundaries become the property of another.\r\n  The son of Achilles rules over the cities and towns; Pyrrhus\r\n  lays them waste, Æneas has wept for Priam. Merlin writes that\r\n  the proud crowd shall perish; the barking dog shall depart, and\r\n  the ox shall go into exile. Then shall the Eutherian grove be\r\n  stripped of its feathered branches; and the Albanian race will\r\n  see their kingdom perish. Wretched Scot, lament, thy hour of\r\n  weeping is now come; for the kingdom of thy forefathers ceases\r\n  to be thine. Thou art deprived of a prince, and art so trodden\r\n  down in the field, that by thy ill merits thou wilt always be an\r\n  ass. A voice from the bottom of the Cambine waters calls thee,\r\n  to be punished with such slaughter as the race of Adam has not\r\n  yet seen. Hasten thither, and become the companion of the devil!\r\n  Andrew will no longer be their leader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe general hatred to the Scots did not hinder the people from\r\nfeeling grieved by the heavy taxes which were raised to support the\r\nwar, and more particularly the expeditions into Flanders, (which\r\nlatter were ill managed, and produced no results,) or from showing\r\ntheir dissatisfaction. The King’s measures of ambition were often\r\nthwarted by the stern opposition of the barons and the commons.\r\nThe following song was directed more particularly against the\r\nunconstitutional seizure of wool, and generally against all the\r\ntaxes raised for the Flemish war.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG AGAINST THE KING’S TAXES.\r\n\r\n[MS.

AMEN.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--O God, king of majesty, for the sake of the\r\n  Trinity,--do not permit our king and his household to\r\n  perish;--great hurt and great ruin he caused him to have,--who\r\n  made him pass over the sea.--In order that the king may prosper,\r\n  may his false advisers be accursed.\r\n\r\n  A king ought not to go out of his kingdom to make war,--unless\r\n  the commons of his land will consent:--by treason we often\r\n  see very many perish;--no one can tell in whom to trust with\r\n  certainty.--Let not the king go out of his kingdom without\r\n  counsel.\r\n\r\n  Now goes in England from year to year--the fifteenth penny, to\r\n  do thus a common harm.--And it makes them go down, who used to\r\n  sit upon a bench;--and it obliges the common people to sell both\r\n  cows, vessels, and clothes.--It does not please thus to pay the\r\n  fifteenth to the last penny.\r\n\r\n  One thing is against faith, whereby the people is\r\n  aggrieved,--that the half of what is raised in the kingdom does\r\n  not come to the king.--Since he has not the whole, as it is given\r\n  to him,--the people is obliged to give the more, and thus they\r\n  are cut short.--For the taxes which are raised are not all given\r\n  to the king.\r\n\r\n  The collecting of the wool grieves the common people still\r\n  more,--which drives them commonly to sell their property.--Such\r\n  counsel cannot be acceptable to God,--thus to destroy the poor\r\n  people by a bitter burthen.--It is not sound law, which gives my\r\n  wool to the king.\r\n\r\n  What is still more contrary to peace, as people witness,--they\r\n  retain two or three parts in the sack.--To whom shall remain\r\n  this wool? Some answer,--that neither king nor queen shall have\r\n  it, but only the collectors.--Such a false weight of wool is\r\n  manifestly a bitter thing.\r\n\r\n  Since the king is determined to take so much,--he may find enough\r\n  among the rich and he would get more and do better, as it appears\r\n  to me,--to have taken a part from the great, and to have spared\r\n  the little.--He sins who takes the money of the needy without\r\n  cause.\r\n\r\n  We ought not to lay such wickedness to the charge of the\r\n  king,--but to the bad counsellor, by his rapacity. The king is a\r\n  young bachelor, and is not of an age--to compass any malice, but\r\n  to do all probity.--Such counsel does general harm.\r\n\r\n  It is no trouble to the great thus to grant to the king a\r\n  tax; the simple must pay it all, which is contrary to God’s\r\n  will.--This counsel is not at all good, but polluted with\r\n  vice;--it is ill ordained, that those who grant should pay\r\n  nothing.--For those who make the grant give nothing to the king,\r\n  it is the needy only who give.\r\n\r\n  How will they perform good deeds out of the sweat of the\r\n  poor,--whom the rich ought to spare, by gift or favour?--they\r\n  ought to tax the great, for the fear of God;--and spare more the\r\n  people, who live in pain.--Thou who art rich enough, live not\r\n  thus upon the poor.\r\n\r\n  I see at the present day how people are proud,--with other\r\n  people’s goods they hold great court, which will quickly\r\n  pass.--When the high judgment comes, the great day of\r\n  wrath,--unless they make atonement, they must then perish.--The\r\n  King says to the bad, “Go:” to the good, “Come.”\r\n\r\n  O God, who wast crowned with the sharp thorn,--have pity with\r\n  divine grace upon thy people!--May the world be comforted of\r\n  such ruin!--To tell unvarnished truth, it is mere robbery.--The\r\n  property of the poor taken without their will, is as it were\r\n  stolen.\r\n\r\n  Such tribute can in no manner last long;--out of emptiness who\r\n  can give, or touch anything with his hands.--People are reduced\r\n  to such ill plight, that they can give no more;--I fear, if they\r\n  had a leader, they would rise in rebellion.--Loss of property\r\n  often makes people fools.\r\n\r\n  There is so much scarcity of money among people,--that people can\r\n  in the market, there are so few buyers,--although they may have\r\n  cloth or corn, swine or sheep,--make nothing of them, in truth,\r\n  there are so many needy people.--The people is not joyful, when\r\n  money is so scarce.\r\n\r\n  If the king would take my advice, I would praise him then,--to\r\n  take the vessels of silver, and make money of them;--it would be\r\n  better to eat out of wood, and to give money for victuals--than\r\n  to serve the body with silver, and pay with wood.--It is a sign\r\n  of vice, to pay for victuals with wood.\r\n\r\n  The commissions of those who are employed over sea are too\r\n  dear;--now the poor have not their lands to sustain the same.--I\r\n  do not know how they can save their souls,--who would live upon\r\n  other people’s goods, and save their own.--They cannot doubt but\r\n  they will be punished, who covet the property of others.\r\n\r\n  May God, for the sake of his holy name, confound errors,--and\r\n  those who meditate treason, and the disturbers of the peace!--and\r\n  take vengeance on such tormentors!--and confirm and grant love\r\n  between the kings!--May he lose consolation who breaks the peace!\r\n  Amen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the English people were grieved by the King’s expensive\r\nand ill-conducted foreign wars, yet they were not wanting in\r\ncommiseration for the Flemish burghers in their struggle against\r\nFrance. The song which follows was composed soon after the battle\r\nof Courtrai, in which the Comte d’Artois and his army were defeated\r\nand destroyed by the Flemings in 1302.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG ON THE FLEMISH INSURRECTION.\r\n\r\n[MS.

TRANSLATION.--Listen, Lordings, both young and old,--of the\r\n  Frenchmen that were so proud and bold,--how the Flemmish men\r\n  bought and sold them--upon a Wednesday.--Better it had been\r\n  for them at home in their country,--than to seek Flemings by\r\n  the sea-strand,--through which many a French woman wrings her\r\n  hands,--and sings, weladay!\r\n\r\n  The King of France made new statutes--in the land of Flanders,\r\n  among false and true,--that the commons of Bruges full sorely\r\n  began to rue,--and said amongst themselves,--“Let us assemble\r\n  together boldly in the evening,--let us take the bailiffs by\r\n  twenties and by tens,--let us clap off their heads above on the\r\n  green,--and let us cast them in the fen.”\r\n\r\n  The weavers and the fullers assembled them all,--and held\r\n  their council in their common hall,--they took Peter Conyng to\r\n  be called their king,--and to be their chieftain.--They took\r\n  their horses out of the stable,--and closed the town within the\r\n  wall;--seventy bailiffs they made down fall,--and many another\r\n  man.\r\n\r\n  Then would the bailiffs that were come from France--drive out\r\n  the Flemings who made the disturbance;--but they turned against\r\n  them with sword and with lance,--strong men and nimble.--I tell\r\n  you for truth, in spite of their vaunting,--and in spite of the\r\n  patronage of the King of France,--four hundred and five had there\r\n  mischance--by day and also by night.\r\n\r\n  Sir Jacques de St. Paul heard how it was:--he assembled sixteen\r\n  hundred knights on the grass;--they went towards Bruges step by\r\n  step,--with a very great body of people.--The Flemings heard tell\r\n  of the case; they begin to clink their basins of brass,--and they\r\n  break them all to pieces as a stone does glass,--and fell them to\r\n  the ground.\r\n\r\n  Sixteen hundred knights had there their end;--they lay in the\r\n  streets stuck like swine;--there they lost their steeds, and many\r\n  a horse,--through their own pride;--Sir Jacques escaped by a\r\n  cunning contrivance,--out at a postern where they sold wine,--out\r\n  of the fight home to his lodging,--in very great fear.\r\n\r\n  When the King of France heard this, anon--he assembled his douze\r\n  peers every one,--the proud Comte d’Artois and others many\r\n  a one,--to come to Paris.--The barons of France began to go\r\n  thither,--into the palace that is paved with stone,--to judge the\r\n  Flemings to be burnt and slain,--through the fleur-de-lis.\r\n\r\n  Then said King Philip, “Listen now to me,--my earls and my\r\n  barons gentle and free,--go, fetch me the traitors in bonds to\r\n  my knees,--hastily and quickly.”--Then swore the Comte de Saint\r\n  Paul, “By the throat of God!--we shall fetch the ribalds wherever\r\n  it be thy will,--and draw them with wild horses out of the\r\n  country--by five-thousands.”\r\n\r\n  “Sir Ralf Devel,” says the Comte de Bologne,--“we will not leave\r\n  alive either canon or monk,--let us go forth anon right without\r\n  any excuse,--nor no man alive (?).--We shall flay the Conyng\r\n  (rabbit), and cause his loins to be roasted;--the fame of him\r\n  shall spring as far as Cologne,--so shall it to Acre and into\r\n  Saxony,--and make them full pale.”\r\n\r\n  Seven counts and forty barons in number,--fifteen hundred knights\r\n  proud and very bold,--sixty thousand squires what with young and\r\n  old,--to take the Flemings.--The Flemings boldly came against\r\n  them;--these proud French comtes, their knights, and their\r\n  men--they killed and slew over the hills and the plains,--all for\r\n  their King’s sake.\r\n\r\n  These French came to Flanders as light as the hare;--before it\r\n  was midnight there fell upon them care;--they were caught in the\r\n  net as a bird is in the snare,--with horse and with steed.--The\r\n  Flemings dab them on the bare head;--they will take for them\r\n  neither ransom nor pay;--they dod off their heads, happen what\r\n  may,--and thereto have they need.\r\n\r\n  Then saith the Comte d’Artois, “I yield me to thee,--Peter Conyng\r\n  by name, if thou art gentle and free,--that I may suffer no\r\n  shame nor disgrace,--and that I may not be slain.”--Then swore a\r\n  butcher, “By my loyalty!--thou shalt never more see the King of\r\n  France,--nor be in prison in the town of Bruges,--thou wouldest\r\n  consume bread.”\r\n\r\n  There they were heaped into the pit-full,--these counts and\r\n  barons and all their knights;--their ladies may wait for them\r\n  in bower and in hall--very long.--In their place must their\r\n  king call other knights,--and take other steeds out of their\r\n  stables:--there they have drunk bitterer than gall,--upon the dry\r\n  land.\r\n\r\n  When the King of France heard these tidings,--he cast down his\r\n  head, his hands he began to wring.--Throughout all France the\r\n  news began to spread;--woe was to them all!--Much was the sorrow\r\n  and the weeping--that was in all France among old and young;--The\r\n  greatest part of the land began to sing,--“Alas! and welaway!”\r\n\r\n  Away, thou young pope! what will be thy counsel?--Thou hast lost\r\n  thy cardinals at thy greatest need;--thou wilt never recover them\r\n  for any kind of reward,--for truth I tell thee.--Go forth to Rome\r\n  to atone for thy misdeeds;--pray to good saints that they let\r\n  thee speed better:--unless thou workest more wisely, thou losest\r\n  land and people,--the crown fell well to the. (?)\r\n\r\n  Alas! thou simple France, it may appear a shame for thee,--that\r\n  a few fullers make thee so tame;--sixty thousand in a day they\r\n  made trip quickly, (?)--with count and knight.--Thereof have\r\n  the Flemings very good game,--and swear by St. Omer and eke by\r\n  St. James,--if they come there any more, it will fall them to\r\n  shame,--with them to fight.\r\n\r\n  I tell you for truth, the battle thus begun,--between France and\r\n  Flanders, how they were foes;--for the French had put the Count\r\n  of Flanders in prison,--with treason faithlessly.--If the Prince\r\n  of Wales his life might have,--it will happen to the King of\r\n  France more bitter than soot;--unless he before-hand do make good\r\n  amends for it,--very sorely he shall rue it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following song seems to have been popular about the beginning\r\nof the fourteenth century.

AMEN.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--Whoso reflecteth upon this life which is full of\r\n  care,--night and day that we are in,--so much we see of sorrow\r\n  and strife,--and little there is of world’s joy.--Hate and wrath\r\n  there is very rife,--and true love is very rare:--men who are in\r\n  the highest station of life,--are most laden with sin.\r\n\r\n  False and wicked is this land,--as every day we may see:--in it\r\n  there is both hate and contention,--I think it will always be\r\n  so.--Covetousness hath the law in hand,--that he may not see the\r\n  truth:--Now pride is master, and contention;--Alas! Lord! why\r\n  suffereth he?\r\n\r\n  If holy church would exert its might,--and the law of the land\r\n  exert it too;--then should covetousness and injustice--out of the\r\n  land be driven.--Holy church should withhold its right--for no\r\n  fear nor for no love;--that they should not show their might--for\r\n  the boast of lordings that are above.\r\n\r\n  To interdict and admonish--all those, whatever they be,--who\r\n  lawful men do rob,--whether on the land or on the sea;--and those\r\n  hoblers in particular,--that take from the husbandman the tillage\r\n  of the ground;--men ought not to bury them in any church,--but to\r\n  throw them out like a dog.\r\n\r\n  Those king’s ministers are corrupted,--that should take heed to\r\n  right and law,--and all the land for to amend,--of these thieves\r\n  they take bribe.--If the man who acts lawfully is brought to\r\n  death,--and his property taken away;--of his death they make no\r\n  account,--but of their prey they have a share.\r\n\r\n  If they have the silver and the bribe--and the property\r\n  received,--they take no heed of felony,--every trespass is\r\n  allowed to pass.--Of these a parable I heard tell;--the Lion is\r\n  king of all beasts,--and (hearken all to my tale)--in his land he\r\n  made a command.\r\n\r\n  The Lion caused to be proclaimed, as it was done,--for he heard\r\n  frequently tell;--and eke it was told him also--that the wolf did\r\n  not well.--And the fox, that wicked fellow,--with the wolf was\r\n  accused;--before their lord they must come,--to make amends for\r\n  their trespass.\r\n\r\n  And so men did [accuse] the simple ass,--that trespassed not,\r\n  nor did any crime,--with them both he was accused,--and in\r\n  the indictment was put.--The fox heard [talk of it] among all\r\n  men,--and told the wolf with the broad crown;--the one sent to\r\n  him [the Lion] geese and hens,--the other kids and mutton.\r\n\r\n  The simple ass thought he was safe,--for he eat nothing but\r\n  grass;--no gifts he gave,--nor suspected that there was any\r\n  harm.--When they came in the presence of their Lord,--he counted\r\n  out to them law and reason;--these wicked beasts laid themselves\r\n  down [prostrate],--“Lord,” said they, “what is thy will?”\r\n\r\n  Then spake the Lion to them,--to the fox in the first place [he\r\n  declared] his will,--“Tell me, fellow, what hast thou done?--Men\r\n  are about thee to ruin.”--Then spake the fox first,--“Lord King,\r\n  now thy will;--these men accuse me of the town,--and would gladly\r\n  ruin me.\r\n\r\n  “Gees nor hen had I not,--Sire, for truth I tell thee,--but as\r\n  I bought them dearly,--and bore them upon my own back.”--“God’s\r\n  anger may they have,--that in the court so placed thee!--Since it\r\n  is so, I vouchsafe,--I forgive thee this guilt.”\r\n\r\n  The false wolf stood behind;--he was dogged and eke fell:--“I\r\n  am come of a great race,--grant thou me peace, who may full\r\n  well.”--“What hast thou done, fair friend,--that thou so askest\r\n  me peace?”--“Sire,” he said, “I will not lie,--if thou wouldst\r\n  hear me a little while.\r\n\r\n  “For I hunted up the downs,--to look, Sire, after my gain;--There\r\n  I slew a mutton,--yea, Sire, and a few kids.--I am accused, sire,\r\n  to thee,--for that same crime;--Sire, I shall clear myself,--I\r\n  gave them neither blow nor hurt.”\r\n\r\n  “For truth I tell thee, fair friend,--they had no good\r\n  mind,--they who accused thee to me,--thou didst nothing but thy\r\n  nature.--Tell thou me, ass, what hast thou done?--Methinks thou\r\n  art capable of no good.--Why haddest thou not [done] as others\r\n  more?--thou art come of wicked place.”\r\n\r\n  “Certes, Sire, I know not;--I eat sage and only grass,--more harm\r\n  did I not;--therefore was I accused.”--“Fair friend, that was\r\n  misdone,--that was against thy nature,--for to eat such grass\r\n  so:--hastily ye him bind;\r\n\r\n  “Draw ye all his bones to pieces,--look that ye do not fail;--and\r\n  that I give all for law,--that his flesh be all torn to\r\n  pieces.”--Thus it fares now in the land,--whoever will take heed\r\n  thereto:--of they that have in hand,--of thieves they take gifts.\r\n\r\n  The man who acts according to law shall be bound,--and condemned\r\n  to strong pain,--and held in fast prison,--until he pays a\r\n  fine.--And the thief to escape so,--that acts ever against the\r\n  right!--God take heed thereto,--who is all full of might!\r\n\r\n  Thus fares all the world now,--as we may all see,--both east\r\n  and west, north and south;--God and the Trinity help us!--Truth\r\n  is failed with stranger and relation,--and as wide as all this\r\n  land--no man can live therein,--what through covetousness and\r\n  through contention.\r\n\r\n  Though the man who acts according to law would hold his life--in\r\n  love, in charity, and in peace,--soon they will compass his\r\n  life,--and that in a little space of time.--Pride is master and\r\n  covetousness--the third brother is called contention;--night and\r\n  day they labour certainly--lawful men, to have their land.\r\n\r\n  When earth has obtained earth,--and thus of earth hast\r\n  enough,--when he is stuck therein,--woe to him that was in\r\n  wickedness!--What is the good that man shall have,--when he shall\r\n  go out of this world?--A sorry garment,--why shall I joke?--For\r\n  he brought him no more.\r\n\r\n  Just as he came, he shall go,--in woe, in pain, in poverty;--take\r\n  good heed, men, to your end,--for as I say, so it will be.--I\r\n  know not of what men are so proud;--of earth, and ashes, skin and\r\n  bone?--when the soul is once out,--there is no viler carcase.\r\n\r\n  The carcase is so loathsome to see,--that under earth men must it\r\n  hide;--both wife and child will from him fly,--there is no friend\r\n  that will stay with him.--What will men for the soul give?--corn\r\n  nor meal, well thou knowest;--but very seldom at their meal,--a\r\n  rough bare trencher, or a crust.\r\n\r\n  The beggar that the crust shall have,--right scornfully he looks\r\n  thereon:--truth to say, and not to joke,--right not a pan he\r\n  is paid.--Then saith the beggar in his mood,--“The crust is\r\n  both hard and tough,--the wretch was hard that possessed the\r\n  goods,--hard for hard is good enough.”\r\n\r\n  May he have much misadventure who for him saith--Pater-noster\r\n  or creed;--but let him have as he did,--for of the gift hath he\r\n  no reward.--I counsel thee have trust in no man,--nor upon no\r\n  other;--but share it with your own fist,--trust neither to sister\r\n  nor brother.\r\n\r\n  Honour God and holy church,--and give to the poor that have\r\n  need;--Thus ye shall work God’s will,--and have for reward the\r\n  joy of heaven.--To which joy us bring--Jesus Christ heaven’s\r\n  King. AMEN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scholastic philosophy flourished through the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the age of Albertus Magnus, of Grosteste, and of Roger\r\nBacon; but, towards the close of that period, the importance of the\r\nschools and universities was rapidly declining.

B. 214, fol. 168, v^o, of\r\n15th cent.]\r\n\r\n        Meum est propositum gentis imperitæ\r\n      Artes frugi reddere melioris vitæ,\r\n      Et ad artes singulas procedatis rite:\r\n      Ad mea decepti juvenes documenta venite.\r\n        Adversatur legibus omne genus cleri,\r\n      Cujus status hodie pejor est quam heri;\r\n      Sua sacra presbiter quisque vult tueri.\r\n      Ingenium magni livor detraxit Homeri.\r\n        Quando contra boream nauta pandit velum,\r\n      Et asellus vincere cursu vult camelum,\r\n      Non formidat ponere manus os in cœlum:\r\n      Vulneror et clausum porto sub pectore telum.\r\n        Præferri bidentibus capra vult hirsuta,\r\n      Stulta non considerans unde sit induta;\r\n      Illi æqua vellera non sunt attributa:\r\n      Pennatis avibus quondam testudo locuta.\r\n        Cum sint nuda gloria logici contenti,\r\n      Sub egentis propere vivunt indumenti,\r\n      Verumtamen invident opulentæ genti.\r\n      Summa petit livor, perflant altissima venti.\r\n        Modus est invidiæ semper, ut ab imis\r\n      Sursum tendant, ultima contradicunt primis:\r\n      Invidere negligit infimo sublimis.\r\n      Invidus alterius rebus macescit opimis.\r\n        Si non cupis vivere pauper et mendicus,\r\n      Semper in laboribus sicut servus Stichus,\r\n      Igni digna subjici sine fructu ficus,\r\n      Dilige sic alios ut sis tibi carus amicus.\r\n        Expedit pauperibus abhærere legi;\r\n      Insudare nimium artibus elegi.\r\n      Ignoro propterea unde possum regi,\r\n      Carmina qui quondam studio florente peregi.\r\n        Nonne circa logicam si quis laborabit,\r\n      Spinas atque tribulos illi germinabit?\r\n      In sudore nimio panem manducabit;\r\n      Vix tamen hoc illi garula lingua dabit.\r\n        In arenam logicus frustra semen serit,\r\n      Nam metendi tempore fructus nullus erit;\r\n      Circa ficum sterilem labor omnis perit.\r\n      Arbor qualis erit, talia poma gerit.\r\n        Licet sis ad apicem artium provectus,\r\n      Fies junioribus in brevi despectus;\r\n      Dicunt de te, “senio desipit affectus.”\r\n      Æmula quid cessas finem properare senectus?\r\n        Veræ pestilentiæ cathedra tu sedes,\r\n      Qui Thebanas lectitas vel Trojanas cædes;\r\n      Affluunt divitiis legistarum sedes,\r\n      Et modo vadit equis qui solet ire pedes.\r\n        Propter artes vigilans est revera stultus;\r\n      Cur circa Georgicam pateris singultus?\r\n      Ager sic per steriles jaceat incultus,\r\n      Telluris si forte velis cognoscere cultus.\r\n        Propter leges merito labor est ferendus;\r\n      Ager reddens centuplum non est deferendus.\r\n      Est libellus pauperum pauperi legendus;\r\n      Hic tibi præcipue sit pura mente colendus.\r\n        Circa dialecticam tempus cur consumis,\r\n      Tu qui nullos redditus aliunde sumis?\r\n      Colat qui per patriam natus est e summis,\r\n      Dives agro, dives positis in fænore nummis.\r\n        Dives in fallaciis discat esse fortis;\r\n      Discat capram facere de persona sortis.\r\n      Artes nunquam deserat citra tempus mortis.\r\n      Contentus fama lateat Lucanus in hortis.\r\n        Si forte deliquerit artibus imbutus,\r\n      Ad legistas fugiet si vult esse tutus:\r\n      Quia se defendere nescit plus quam mutus,\r\n      Græcorum studia nimium diuque sequutus.\r\n        Atria nobilium video patere;\r\n      Cum legista venerit dissolvuntur ceræ.\r\n      Exclusus ad januam poteris sedere,\r\n      Ipse licet venias musis comitatus, Homere.\r\n        Logicus araneæ potest comparari,\r\n      Quæ subtiles didicit telas operari,\r\n      Quæ suis visceribus volunt consummari;\r\n      Est pretium musca, si forte queat laqueari.\r\n        Si fortuna logico favet in privigno,\r\n      Vultu namque logicum respicit benigno;\r\n      Si sit dives logicus hoc sub cœli signo;\r\n      Rara avis in terra nigroque simillima cigno.\r\n        Naturæ cognoscere si velis archana,\r\n      Stude circa physicam quæ dat membra sana:\r\n      Sat quicquid expostulat egestas humana,\r\n      Sat Galienus opes et sanctio Justiniana.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--It is my design to turn the arts of an unskilful\r\n  race to the fruit of a better life, and so proceed ye to each\r\n  of the arts in order: O youth who have been deceived, come to\r\n  my lessons.--Every class of the clergy is opposed to the laws,\r\n  of whom the condition to-day is worse than it was yesterday;\r\n  every priest will hold his own rites: envy detracted from the\r\n  talents of great Homer.--When the sailor spreads his sail against\r\n  the north wind, and the ass thinks to conquer the camel in the\r\n  race, then the hand fears not to put the face towards heaven;\r\n  I am wounded and carry the weapon shut up in my breast.--The\r\n  shaggy she-goat wishes to be preferred to the sheep, in her folly\r\n  not considering with what she is clothed; so fine a fleece has\r\n  not been given to her: as the tortoise once said to the winged\r\n  birds.--Although the logicians are satisfied with naked glory,\r\n  and live under the garb of the needy, nevertheless they envy the\r\n  rich. Envy seeks the summit, the wind blows vehemently on lofty\r\n  places.--It is always the manner of envy, that they aim from\r\n  the bottom upwards, the last speak against the first: he who is\r\n  elevated does not think it worth while to envy him who is most\r\n  low. The envious man becomes lean by regarding the fatness of\r\n  another.--If you do not desire to live poor and beggarly, always\r\n  labouring like the servant Stichus, a fig-tree without fruit\r\n  worthy to be cast in the fire; love others so that thou mayest be\r\n  a dear friend to thyself.--It is good for poor men to adhere to\r\n  the law; I have chosen to labour much on the arts. I am ignorant\r\n  therefore how I may be guided, who once composed verses, while\r\n  my study flourished.--If any one will expend his labour upon\r\n  logic, will it not produce him thorns and brambles? in too much\r\n  sweat he will eat his bread; and even that his talkative tongue\r\n  will hardly give him.--The logician in vain sows his seed in the\r\n  sand, for in harvest time there will be no fruit; upon a barren\r\n  fig-tree all labour is lost. Such as is the tree, such will be\r\n  the fruit it bears.--Although you be arrived at the summit of\r\n  the arts, you will be in a short time despised by the younger\r\n  aspirants; they will say of thee, “he doats, affected with old\r\n  age.” Old age, why do you emulous cease to hasten the end?--Thou\r\n  sittest in the chair of a true pestilence, who readest the\r\n  tragedy of Thebes or of Troy; [whilst] the seats of the legists\r\n  abound in riches, and now he goes on horseback who used to go\r\n  on foot.--He who sits up at night to study the arts is truly a\r\n  fool; why do you yawn over the Georgic? thus the field may lie\r\n  neglected and barren, while by chance you may be desirous of\r\n  understanding the culture of the earth.--It is right that we\r\n  should labour upon the laws; a field that produces a hundred-fold\r\n  is not to be set aside. The book of the poor is to be read by the\r\n  poor man; this chiefly is the book to be devotedly cultivated\r\n  by thee.--Why do you consume your time upon dialectics, thou\r\n  who receivest no income from other sources? Let him cultivate\r\n  it who is born of high family in the country, rich in land and\r\n  rich in money laid out at interest.--Let the rich man learn to\r\n  be strong in fallacies; let him learn to make a she-goat of the\r\n  person of chance. Let him never desert the arts, before the hour\r\n  of his death. Satisfied with fame, let Lucan lie hid in the\r\n  gardens.--If imbued in the arts he should chance to fail, he will\r\n  fly to the legists if he will be safe: because he knows no more\r\n  how to defend himself than one who is dumb, having pursued too\r\n  much and too often the study of the Greeks.--I see the halls of\r\n  the nobles open; when the legist comes, the bolts are undone;\r\n  thou, shut out, mayest sit at the door, although thou thyself,\r\n  Homer, shouldst come along with the muses.--The logician may be\r\n  compared to a spider, which learns to spin subtle webs, that are\r\n  made out of its own bowels; the reward is a fly, if by chance\r\n  it can be netted.--If fortune favour a logician in his kindred,\r\n  for she looks upon the logician with a benignant countenance; if\r\n  a logician be rich under this sign of the heavens; he is a rare\r\n  bird upon earth, and very like a black swan.--If you wish to know\r\n  the secrets of nature, study physic which gives health to the\r\n  limbs; what man’s need requires is enough, Galen and the sanction\r\n  of Justinian are riches enough.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following English verses, composed at the same period, seem\r\nalso intended as a satire upon the studies and arguments of the\r\ndialectitians.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF “NEGO.”\r\n\r\n[From MS. Harl. No. 913, fol. 58, v^o. written in 1308.]\r\n\r\n      Hit nis bot trewth, I wend, an afte\r\n      For te sette _nego_ in eni crafte;\r\n      Trewth so drawith to heven blisse,\r\n      _Nego_ doth noȝt so i-wisse.\r\n      For-sak and save is thef in lore,\r\n      _Nego_ is pouer clark in store.\r\n      Whan menne horlith ham here and there,\r\n      _Nego_ savith ham fram care.\r\n      Awei with _nego_ ute of place!\r\n      Whose wol have Goddis grace;\r\n      Whoso wol aȝens the devil fiȝte,\r\n      Ther mai _nego_ sit a-riȝte.\r\n      Ak loke that we never more\r\n      _Nego_ sette in trew lore.\r\n      For whoso can lite, hath sone i-do,\r\n      Anone he drawith to _nego_.\r\n      Now o clerk seiith _nego_;\r\n      And that other _dubito_;\r\n      Seiith another _concedo_;\r\n      And another _obligo_,\r\n      _Verum falsum_ sette therto;\r\n      Than is al the lore i-do.\r\n      Thus the fals clerkes of har hevid,\r\n      Makith men trewth of ham be revid.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--It is contrary to truth, I believe, and ...--to\r\n  set _nego_ in any craft;--truth draweth us to the joy of\r\n  heaven,--_nego_ does not so certainly.--Forsake and save is a\r\n  thief in doctrine,--_nego_ is a poor clerk in store.--When men\r\n  hurl them here and there,--_nego_ saves them from care.--Away\r\n  with _nego_ out of the place!--whoever will have God’s\r\n  grace;--he who will against the devil fight,--there may _nego_\r\n  sit rightly.--But see that we never more--set _nego_ in true\r\n  doctrine.--For he who knows little has soon done,--anon he\r\n  draws to _nego_.--Now one clerk says _nego_;--and the other\r\n  _dubito_;--saith another _concedo_;--and another _obligo_,--with\r\n  _verum falsum_ set to it;--then is all their learning done.--Thus\r\n  the false clerks of their head,--make men of truth through them\r\n  be bereaved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Scottish wars occupied incessantly the remaining years of\r\nEdward’s reign. The following song was composed probably in the\r\nSeptember of the year 1306, soon after the battle of Kirkencliff,\r\nand on the immediate occasion of the execution of Sir Simon Fraser,\r\nwho was taken prisoner there.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG ON THE EXECUTION OF SIR SIMON FRASER.\r\n\r\n[MS. Harl. 2253, fol. 59, v^o. of reign of Edw.

traitors of Scotland who are taken with a trap;--he who loves\r\n  falseness, and will never leave it,--sore may he dread the life\r\n  that he is in,--I believe:--seldom was he glad--that never was\r\n  sorrowful--for his wickedness and turbulence.\r\n\r\n  I say that of these Scots who are now drawn,--their heads on\r\n  London bridge anybody may recognise:--they thought to have been\r\n  kings, and said so in their talk;--better was it for them to have\r\n  been barons and live in God’s law,--with love.--He who hateth\r\n  truth and right,--little he fears God’s might,--the high king\r\n  above.\r\n\r\n  To be a warning to all the gentlemen who are in Scotland,--the\r\n  Wallace was drawn, and afterwards was hanged,--beheaded all\r\n  alive, his bowels burnt,--the head to London Bridge was sent--to\r\n  remain there.--Afterwards Simon Fraser, who was traitor and\r\n  fickle,--and known full wide.\r\n\r\n  Sir Edward our king, who is full of piety,--sent the Wallace’s\r\n  quarters to his own country,--to hang in four parts (of the\r\n  country), to be their mirror,--thereupon to think, in order that\r\n  many might see--and dread.--Why would they not take warning--of\r\n  the battle of Dunbar,--how ill they sped?\r\n\r\n  Bishops and barons came to the king’s peace,--as men that were\r\n  false, fickle, and lying,--oaths they swore to him in the place\r\n  where he was,--to be firm and true to him in all kinds of\r\n  moments,--thrice (?),--that they should not against him go,--so\r\n  were they tamed then;--what profits it to lie?\r\n\r\n  To King Edward they plight their faith;--false was their covenant\r\n  as frost is in May,--which the sun from the southward wipes\r\n  away;--many a proud Scot thereof may lament--in year.--Was never\r\n  Scotland--by dint of man’s hand--altogether bought so dear.\r\n\r\n  The Bishop of Glasgow, I wot he was taken;--the Bishop of St.\r\n  Andrew, too, he is caught;--the Abbot of Scone with the King is\r\n  not ...;--all their purpose is come to nothing,--by right.--They\r\n  were unwise--when they thought it praiseworthy--against their\r\n  king to fight.\r\n\r\n  Through counsel of these bishops named before,--Sir Robert the\r\n  Bruce first was chosen king,--he may every day his foes see\r\n  before him;--if they may catch him, I wot he is undone,--without\r\n  fail.--To say the truth,--dearly he shall pay--for having begun\r\n  battle.\r\n\r\n  They that crowned him were proud and bold,--they made a king of\r\n  summer, as they never should,--they set on his head a crown of\r\n  red gold,--and gave him a sceptre as one should to a king,--to\r\n  judge.--When he was set on a throne,--little good knew he--a\r\n  kingdom to rule.\r\n\r\n  Now King Hobbe gangeth in the moors,--to come to town he has no\r\n  desire;--the barons of England if they might gripe him,--they\r\n  would teach him to pipe in English,--through strength:--be he\r\n  never so stout,--yet he is sought out--wide and far.\r\n\r\n  Sir Edward of Caernarvon, (Jesus save him and have him in\r\n  regard!)--and Sir Aymer de Valence, a gentle knight and\r\n  liberal,--they have sworn their oath that, by the grace of\r\n  God!--they will deliver us from that false country,--if\r\n  they can.--Much hath Scotland lost,--what latterly and what\r\n  before,--and little praise won.\r\n\r\n  Now I shall take up where I left off before,--and tell you of\r\n  Fraser, as I promised you;--in the battle of Kirkencliff Fraser\r\n  was taken;--his countenance ceased from making any boast--near\r\n  Stirling:--knights and swains,--freemen and thanes,--many with\r\n  him.\r\n\r\n  They were so beset on every part,--some were slain and some\r\n  drowned themselves.--Sir John de Lyndsay would not remain,--he\r\n  waded into the water with his companions beside him--to\r\n  drown.--Why would not they beware?--There is none looked again\r\n  (?):--why would not they reflect?\r\n\r\n  It was before St. Bartholomew’s mass,--that Fraser was taken,\r\n  were it more or less:--To Sir Thomas de Multon, a gentle knight\r\n  and liberal,--and to Sir John Jose, he was delivered then--in\r\n  hand:--he was well fettered--both with iron and with steel,--to\r\n  bring out of Scotland.\r\n\r\n  Soon afterwards the tidings came to the king;--they sent him to\r\n  London with many an armed man;--he came in at Newgate, I tell\r\n  it you faithfully,--a garland of leaves placed on his head--of\r\n  green;--because he should be known--both by high and by low--as\r\n  a traitor, I ween.\r\n\r\n  Fettered were his legs under his horse’s belly;--both with iron\r\n  and with steel manacled were his hands;--a garland of periwinkle\r\n  set on his head;--much was the power that was taken from him--in\r\n  land:--As may God amend me!--he little supposed--so to be brought\r\n  in hand.\r\n\r\n  Sir Herbert of Morham, a fair knight and bold,--for the love\r\n  of Fraser his life was sold;--a wager he made, so it was\r\n  said,--to smite off his head if they took him in hold,--whatever\r\n  betide.--Sorry was he then,--when he might know him--to ride\r\n  through the town.\r\n\r\n  Then said his squire a word anon right,--“Sir, we are dead, there\r\n  is no creature to help us;”--(the squire was named Thomas de\r\n  Bois)--“now I wot our wager turns to our sorrow,--so bet.”--I\r\n  give you to know,--their heads were smitten off--before the gate\r\n  of the Tower.\r\n\r\n  It was on our Lady’s eve, for truth I understand,--the justices\r\n  sat for the knights of Scotland,--Sir Thomas de Multon, a\r\n  gentle knight and wise,--and Sir Ralph de Sandwich, who is much\r\n  esteemed in worth,--and Sir John Abel;--more I might tell by\r\n  reckoning,--both of great and of small,--ye know very well.\r\n\r\n  Then said the justice, who is gentle and free,--“Sir Simon\r\n  Fraser, the king’s traitor hast thou been,--on water and on land,\r\n  as many may see:--what sayest thou thereto? how wilt thou clear\r\n  thyself?--do say.”--He knew himself to be so foul,--he had not\r\n  whereon to trust--to say, nay.\r\n\r\n  There he was judged, as it was the law of the land,--because he\r\n  was traitor to his lord, first he was drawn,--upon a bullock’s\r\n  hide forth he was led:--for once in his life he was a moody\r\n  knight--in heart.--Wickedness and sin,--it is little gain--that\r\n  makes the body smart.\r\n\r\n  For all his great power, still he was taken;--falseness and\r\n  treachery all come to nothing;--when he was in Scotland, little\r\n  was his thought--of the hard judgment which was prepared for\r\n  him--in a short time.--He was four times perjured--to the king\r\n  there before,--and that brought him to the ground.\r\n\r\n  With fetters and with gyves I wot he was drawn,--from the\r\n  Tower of London, that many might know,--in a kirtle of\r\n  sack-cloth in strange wise,--and a garland on his head of the\r\n  new guise,--through Cheap;--many a man of England--to see\r\n  Simon--thither began to leap.\r\n\r\n  When he came to the gallows, first he was hanged,--beheaded all\r\n  alive, though it seemed to him long,--afterwards he was opened,\r\n  his bowels burnt,--the head to London Bridge was sent--for\r\n  disgrace:--As I may ever thrive!--at one time he thought--little\r\n  there to stand.\r\n\r\n  They ride through the city, as I may tell,--with game and with\r\n  solace, that was their play,--to London Bridge they took the\r\n  way,--many was the woman’s child that thereon lacks-a-day,--and\r\n  said, alas!--that he was born,--and so vilely undone,--so fair a\r\n  man as he was.\r\n\r\n  Now stands the head above the twi-bridge,--fast by Wallace,\r\n  to say the truth;--after succour from Scotland long they may\r\n  pray,--and after help from France what profits it to wait, (?)--I\r\n  ween.--It were better for him in Scotland--with his axe in his\r\n  hand--to play on the green.\r\n\r\n  And the body hangs fast on the gallows,--with iron clasps long\r\n  to last;--to guard well the body, and the Scotch to drive away\r\n  (?),--four-and-twenty there are for sooth at least--by night.--If\r\n  any one were so hardy--the body to remove--immediately to attack\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  If Sir Robert the Bruce were come to this land,--and the Earl of\r\n  Athol that is hard in hand,--all the rest of the common people,\r\n  for truth I understand,--might be full blith, and thank God’s\r\n  sending,--with right:--then might each man--both ride and go--in\r\n  peace, without fighting.\r\n\r\n  The traitors of Scotland took counsel with themselves,--to bring\r\n  the barons of England to death;--Charles of France, as many a one\r\n  said,--with might and with strength would help them,--thanks to\r\n  him!--Tprot, Scot, for thy strife!--hang up thy hatchet and thy\r\n  knife,--while life lasts to him--with the long shanks.\r\n\r\n       *

jewels of the rich draw from\r\n  their inflexibility, or from the cry of the poor; they judge what\r\n  is just, and do not fall off from the right for the sake of the\r\n  rich. But now the age deceives many in a wonderful manner, and\r\n  draws them into danger, for love of the world, that they may lick\r\n  up honours. The cause of this is money, to which almost every\r\n  court has now wedded itself.\r\n\r\n  There are judges, whom partiality and bribes seduce from justice;\r\n  these are they, I remember well, that pay toll to the devil,\r\n  and they serve him alone. For the law of nature commands, that\r\n  a judge in giving judgment should not be an acceptor of anybody\r\n  either for prayer or money; what therefore, O good Jesus, will be\r\n  done with the judges, who for prayers or gifts recede from what\r\n  is just?\r\n\r\n  In fact such judges have numerous messengers;--listen for what\r\n  purpose. If you wish to claim land, a messenger will come to you,\r\n  and speaks in confidence, saying, “Dear friend, do you wish to\r\n  plead? I am one who can help you in various ways with the judge;\r\n  if you wish to obtain anything by his aid, give me half, and I\r\n  will help you.”\r\n\r\n  At his feet sit clerks, who are like people half-famished,\r\n  gaping for gifts; and proclaiming it as law, that those who give\r\n  nothing, although they come early, will have to wait.\r\n\r\n  But if some noble lady, fair and lovely, with horns on her head,\r\n  and that encircled with gold, come for judgment, such a one\r\n  despatches her business without having to say a word.\r\n\r\n  If the woman be poor, and has no gifts, neither beauty nor rich\r\n  relationship, whom Venus does not stimulate, she goes home\r\n  without effecting her business, sorrowful at heart.\r\n\r\n  There are some at this court, who express judgment; whom they\r\n  call relaters, worse than the others. They take with both hands,\r\n  and so deceive those whose defenders they are. And what shall we\r\n  say to the ushers? who say to the poor that follow the court,\r\n  “Poor man, why do you trouble yourself? why do you wait here?\r\n  unless you give money to everybody in this court, you labour\r\n  in vain. Why then, wretch, do you lament? If you have brought\r\n  nothing, you will stand altogether out of doors.”\r\n\r\n  Concerning the sheriffs, who can relate with sufficient fulness\r\n  how hard they are to the poor? He who has nothing to give is\r\n  dragged hither and thither, and is placed in the assises, and is\r\n  obliged to take his oath, without daring to murmur. But if he\r\n  should murmur, unless he immediately make satisfaction, it is all\r\n  salt sea.\r\n\r\n  The same people have this vice, when they enter the house of some\r\n  countryman, or of a famous abbey, where drink and victuals, and\r\n  all things necessary, are given to them devoutly. Such things\r\n  are of no avail, unless by and by the jewels follow after the\r\n  meal, and are distributed to all, bedels and garçons, and all\r\n  who are with them. Nor even yet are they paid, unless robes of\r\n  various colours are transmitted to their wives. If these are not\r\n  sent privately, then they proceed as follows; whatever cattle\r\n  they find, are driven off violently to their own manors, and\r\n  the owners themselves are put in confinement until they make\r\n  satisfaction, so that they give the double: then at length they\r\n  are liberated.\r\n\r\n  I laugh at their clerks, whom I see at first indigent enough, and\r\n  possessing next to nothing, when they receive a bailiwick; which\r\n  received they next show themselves proud, and their teeth grow,\r\n  and holding up their necks they begin very hastily to buy lands\r\n  and houses, and agreeable rents; and amassing money themselves,\r\n  they despise the poor, and make new laws, oppressing their\r\n  neighbours; and they become wise men. In this they do wickedness,\r\n  and deceive their country, sparing no one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next song was doubtlessly considered as very libellous at the\r\ntime when it was composed, and professes to have been written in\r\nthe wild wood; the means of publication being to drop it on the\r\nhigh road, that it might fall into the hands of passengers. It is\r\ndirected against one of the king’s ordinances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLAW’S SONG OF TRAILLEBASTON.\r\n\r\n[MS. Harl. No. 2253, fol. 113, v^o. of the reign of Edw.

en parchemyn pur mout remenbrer,\r\n      E gitté en haut chemyn, qe um le dust trover.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--I am seized with the desire to rhyme and to make a\r\n  story,--of a purveyance which is provided in the land;--it would\r\n  be much better if the thing were still undone:--if God does not\r\n  avert it, I think that there will arise war.\r\n\r\n  It is the articles of Traillebaston;--except the king himself,\r\n  may he have God’s curse--whoever first granted such a\r\n  commission!--For there is little reason in any of the points of\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  Sire, if I wished to chastise my lad--with a slap or two, to\r\n  amend him,--he will ask a bill against me, and will cause me to\r\n  be arrested,--and to give a great ransom before I escape from\r\n  prison.\r\n\r\n  Forty shillings they take for my ransom,--and the sheriff comes\r\n  for his fee,--that he may not put me in deep prison.--Now\r\n  consider, lords, is this right?\r\n\r\n  For this cause I will keep myself among the woods, in the\r\n  beautiful shade;--where there is no falseness and no bad law;--in\r\n  the wood of Beauregard, where the jay flies,--and where the\r\n  nightingale sings always without ceasing.\r\n\r\n  But the bad idlers, on whom may God have no pity!--with their\r\n  false mouths have indited me--of ill robberies and other\r\n  delinquency,--so that I dare not be received among my friends.\r\n\r\n  I have served my lord the king in peace and in war,--in Flanders,\r\n  Scotland, and his land of Gascony;--but now I do not know how to\r\n  make any expedient for myself;--all my time I have spent in vain\r\n  to please such a man.\r\n\r\n  If these wicked jurors will not amend,--that I may be able to\r\n  ride and go at my peace,--if I can reach them I will make their\r\n  heads fly off,--I would not give a penny for all their threats.\r\n\r\n  The Martin and the Knoville are people of piety,--and pray for\r\n  the poor that they may have safety;--Spigurnel and Belflour are\r\n  people of cruelty,--if they were in my keeping they should not be\r\n  returned.\r\n\r\n  I would teach them the game of Trailebaston,--and would break\r\n  their backbone and their crupper,--their arms and their legs, it\r\n  would be but right,--I would cut their tongues and their mouths\r\n  likewise.\r\n\r\n  He who first commenced these things,--never in his life will he\r\n  be amended;--I tell you for truth, he has committed therein too\r\n  great a sin,--for out of the fear of prison there will be many a\r\n  robber made.\r\n\r\n  He will become a robber who was never so before,--who for fear\r\n  of prison dare not come to peace;--it is necessary to have\r\n  livelihood every day as it comes;--he who commenced this thing,\r\n  undertook a great task.\r\n\r\n  Well may merchants and monks bestow a curse--on all those who\r\n  ordained the Trailebaston;--the royal protection will not be\r\n  worth a garlic to them,--if they do not repay the pence without\r\n  recompense.\r\n\r\n  You who are indited, I advise you, come to me,--to the green wood\r\n  of Beauregard, there where there is no plea,--except wild beast\r\n  and beautiful shade;--for the common law is too much to be feared.\r\n\r\n  If thou knowest letters, and art enraged,--thou shalt be called\r\n  before the justices;--again you may be returned to prison,--in\r\n  keeping of the bishop, until you be cleansed;--and suffer\r\n  mis-ease and too hard penance,--and perchance you will never have\r\n  deliverance.\r\n\r\n  Therefore it is better to dwell with me in the wood,--than to lie\r\n  cast in the bishop’s prison.--Too much is the penance, and hard\r\n  to suffer;--he who has the opportunity to select what is better,\r\n  is a fool if he does not make the choice.\r\n\r\n  Before I knew little what was good, now I am less wise;--the bad\r\n  laws cause this by very great outrage,--so that I dare not come\r\n  to the peace among my kindred;--the rich are put to ransom, the\r\n  poor to prison.\r\n\r\n  It would be penible to engage what cannot be acquitted;--that is\r\n  the life of man which is so dearly loved;--and I have not at all\r\n  the goods wherewith to be bought off;--but if I were in their\r\n  power I should be put to death.\r\n\r\n  Yet if I should expect grace and hear people talk,--those would\r\n  say evil to me who dare not approach me,--and would willingly\r\n  see my body disgraced.--But God can save a man in the midst of a\r\n  thousand devils.\r\n\r\n  He can save me, who is the son of Mary;--for I am not culpable, I\r\n  am indited out of malice;--God’s curse be on those who drove me\r\n  to this place!--The world is so variable, that he is a fool who\r\n  trusts in it.\r\n\r\n  If I am a companion and know archery,--my neighbour will go and\r\n  say, “This man belongs to a company,--to go hunt in the wood and\r\n  do other folly;”--so now I will live as a pig will lead his life.\r\n\r\n  If I happen to know more law than they know,--they will say this\r\n  conspirator begins to be treasonable,--and I will not approach\r\n  home within ten leagues of them;--of all neighbourhoods cursed be\r\n  those.\r\n\r\n  I pray all good people that they will pray for me,--that I may be\r\n  able to go and ride to my country;--I was never a homicide, at\r\n  least by design,--nor an ill robber to do people damage.\r\n\r\n  This rhyme was made in the wood beneath a bay tree,--there sings\r\n  the thrush, the nightingale, and the hawk cries (?);--it was\r\n  written on parchment to be better remembered,--and cast in the\r\n  highway, that people may find it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following song is a satire upon the numerous

Colle,--scoundrels,\r\n  horse-boys,--by pate and by poll;--to the devil I them\r\n  deliver--and give for toll.\r\n\r\n  The gadlings were gathered--of ...;--palfrey-keepers and\r\n  pages,--and boys with boast;--all were ...--of a horse ...:--may\r\n  the devil devour them--raw or roasted!\r\n\r\n  The maker that made them,--he shed them to shame,--to fleas and\r\n  to fly,--to tyke and to toad;--so saith Romanz,--whoever read\r\n  right,--fly comes of flower,--and louse comes of lad.\r\n\r\n  The rogues are horelings,--and haunt the play:--the gadlings are\r\n  gluttons,--and drink before it dawns.--Satan their sire--said in\r\n  his saying,--Goblin made his garner--of the grooms’ maw.\r\n\r\n  The knave crams his crop--before the cock crows;--he mumbles\r\n  and mocks,--and marrs his maw;--when he is all weary of lapping\r\n  (?),--and laid over law,--a dozen of dogs--could not draw him.\r\n\r\n  The ribalds arise--before the day breaks;--they scrape on their\r\n  scabs,--and draw themselves to the dew.--Seen it is on his\r\n  forehead--and on his eye-brows, that he looseth a flatterer,--and\r\n  shoeth a shrew.\r\n\r\n  Now are horse-clawers--shamefully clothed;--they busk them with\r\n  buttons--as it were a bride:--with low laced shoes--of a heifer’s\r\n  hide,--they pick out of their provender--all their pride.\r\n\r\n  Whoever reckons with knaves--their expense,--the perverseness\r\n  of the lad,--the pride of the page,--though he give them cats’\r\n  dirt--for their sustenance,--yet he shall rue--of the arrears.\r\n\r\n  While God was on earth--and wandered wide,--what was the\r\n  reason--why he would not ride?--Because he would not have a\r\n  groom--to go by his side,--nor the grudging of any gadling--to\r\n  jaw or to chide.\r\n\r\n  Haste you to spew,--as men do to spell (talk);--may the fiend\r\n  devour you--with flesh and with skin!--Harken this way,\r\n  horsemen,--a tiding I tell you,--that ye shall hang,--and be\r\n  lodged in hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF EDWARD II. 1307-1327.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward the First quitted the stage at a period when wars from\r\nwithout and internal troubles were gathering fast over his country.\r\nHis son and successor, a weak and ill-advised prince, was little\r\ncalculated to repel the one or to calm the other; and the following\r\nsong shows us that,

What the authority of the powers above willed has\r\n  been fulfilled; the death of Peter at last has been effected,--he\r\n  reigned much too long. The bad tree is cut down, when Peter is\r\n  struck on the neck:--Blessed be the weapon which thus approached\r\n  Peter! Blessed be the hand which executed him! blessed the man\r\n  who ordered the execution! blessed the steel which struck him\r\n  whom the world would not bear any longer!

Celebrate, my tongue, the death of Peter who disturbed\r\n  England, whom the king in his love for him placed over all\r\n  Cornwall; hence in his pride he will be called Earl, and not\r\n  Peter.--The people of the kingdom was made sorrowful for the\r\n  fraud upon the treasure, when Peter becomes wastefully insolent\r\n  with the treasury, not bearing in mind what the future day may\r\n  produce for him.--This is the work of our salvation, that Peter\r\n  is dead; all the artfulness of the multifarious traitor has\r\n  perished; henceforth let the good omen rejoice our hearts, for\r\n  sorrow is past.--When the fulness of time which was fit for the\r\n  thing came, his head is cut off from the juncture of the body;\r\n  he who raised troubles within the kingdom is now troubled from\r\n  without.--He who was unwilling to have an equal, clothed in\r\n  the extreme of pride, against his will bends his neck to the\r\n  executioner; of whose merited death this hymn is set forth.--He\r\n  who placed himself as a head above his equals, loses his own\r\n  head; justly his body is pierced, whose heart was so puffed up;\r\n  both land, sea, stars, and world, rejoice in his fall.--Ferocious\r\n  and cruel among all men, he ceases now from his pomp; now he no\r\n  longer behaves himself like an earl, or a king; the unworthy man,\r\n  worthy of death, undergoes the death which he merits.--This tree\r\n  with its branches bent falls into a proverb; for the stiffness\r\n  which pride gave is softened; thus ought the ambitious and\r\n  aspiring man to be humbled.--May the house of Peter, in which he\r\n  is held, not be supported in strength; may the other place be\r\n  profane, and may it be in disgrace, which the filthy gore spilled\r\n  from Peter’s body has defiled!--Glory be to the Creator! Glory to\r\n  the Earls who have made Peter die with his charms! Henceforth may\r\n  there be peace and rejoicing throughout England!

constrained too much to be prostrate to the daughter, by\r\n  whom the maternal crown is injured.--A general proclamation went\r\n  through England, admonishing everybody to take up arms, that the\r\n  army might go to Scotland to vindicate our rights, or to be able\r\n  to avenge our injury.--To which theme I ought to procrastinate\r\n  very much; the king began to assemble his troops, unadvisedly he\r\n  went to make war on the Scots: his anger voluntarily subsided,\r\n  unwilling longer to hold out.--There were in the army many\r\n  nobles, knights who were too showy and pompous; when so many\r\n  impetuous men came to the conflict, the courageous enemies\r\n  were ready enough.--They were courageous, as will appear; when\r\n  the two sides engaged, that one remained firm, but that which\r\n  had shown so much pride fled. The wicked party succumbed, the\r\n  cunning one conquered.--An unheard-of battle thickened between\r\n  them; first rushed forward the unconquered Actæus, the Earl of\r\n  Gloucester, alas! giving fatal blows; who, standing in the thick\r\n  of the battle, is deserted.--He compelled the troops of the\r\n  enemy to break, and subdued the bodies of strong men; but one of\r\n  his own chosen retainers, he was not a fool when he ruined the\r\n  affair.--This is the traitorous man, Bartholomew, whom in all\r\n  victories may God confound! Because he has been to his master\r\n  as changeable as a Pharisee. Hence as the representative of\r\n  Judas he shall be condemned to death.--Seeing the enemy’s rage\r\n  against his master, he pretends that he had been out more than\r\n  six weeks; because he refused to come to his master’s support,\r\n  this traitor has deserved to be put to the rack.--Many are they\r\n  whereby the Earl was seduced, led like a sheep to the sacrifice\r\n  and to death; through whom such common lamentation arises,\r\n  is sufficiently known by their fruits.--With whose venom all\r\n  England is poisoned; and thus common justice is weakened; by\r\n  these the royal judgment is darkened; in consequence of this,\r\n  faith is driven into exile.--Charity lies subdued, and virtue is\r\n  trodden down; ingratitude flourishes, and fraud rules; whatever\r\n  of evil is perpetrated in this country, is all the work of the\r\n  aforesaid traitors.--This deceitful man was not the only one\r\n  by whom the art of treason was now exercised; but there was\r\n  another concerned in it, whom may heaven not conceal, and may\r\n  he become, as he deserves, a morsel of hell.--Knights such\r\n  as these, obstinate against the kingdom, retainers of Satan,\r\n  are too rapacious; if the King’s judges every where are true,\r\n  they will destroy the enchanters and their followers.--They\r\n  deserved to suffer judgment of decapitation, since voluntarily\r\n  they have betrayed such a soldiery; the Earl’s domestics, who\r\n  were clowns, as they have remained, took to flight.--These by\r\n  a multifarious treason betrayed their lord, whom the impious\r\n  people of Scotland surrounded; they struck him down from his\r\n  steed, and the faithful esquires who were with him fell struck\r\n  down in different ways; the knights and others fell along with\r\n  him; when his friends tried to succour him, they were not able to\r\n  resist so many enemies.--Thus died an Earl who was distinguished\r\n  above all others, who had given his property to wicked men; let\r\n  every one have a care to himself, after these examples, that\r\n  he give not henceforth trust to such unworthy people.--By this\r\n  let those Earls who are still alive, learning from experience,\r\n  be on their guard, when at another time they stand united\r\n  in battle, that they be not thus bruised by the weapon of\r\n  treason.--England is tormented with very much grief, that she is\r\n  deprived of her honour by such craftiness; let her be fortified\r\n  more cautiously, with labour of mind, that the last error be\r\n  not worse than the former.--I advise the Earls who are still\r\n  alive, that henceforward they destroy traitors; and thus by their\r\n  industry let them all be made prisoners; let the English thus\r\n  make their way into Scotland.--I believe that I tell the truth,\r\n  I endeavour not to say what is false; now the honour of our\r\n  nation begins to decline; when the livid colour of death spread\r\n  itself over the Earl, then immediately grew the terrible grief\r\n  of England.--Of our people of England some are in captivity;\r\n  some ran away from the battle half dead; they who were rich are\r\n  made ransom; because the nobles go mad, the common people are\r\n  the sufferers.--The minds of the chieftains of England are weary\r\n  with studying, for the league of justice is without any certain\r\n  existence; may therefore the King of power, who sprang from the\r\n  root of Jesse, destroy utterly the maintainers of perfidy!--When\r\n  the north-east wind rages, the south-west wind dropped; and to\r\n  the people of the south the pain of death increased. England\r\n  used to obtain victory, but by the treachery of the offspring\r\n  the mother hath lost her savour.--If you knew, Gloucester, your\r\n  fate, you would weep, because your heir perishes in Scotland; thy\r\n  sons-in-law will take thee, from whom thou wilt suffer disgrace;\r\n  lest they should make thee ... thou will bruise the present\r\n  government.--Thou art made as a lady widowed of her husband,\r\n  whose comfort is changed into weeping; thou art a solitary city\r\n  deprived of thy head; may the blessed Trinity amend thy fortune!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last piece in our collection is rather different in character\r\nfrom those which have preceded it. One of the most unpopular acts\r\nof this weak reign was the execution of the Earl of Lancaster in\r\n1322. The love which the people bore towards him, led them to\r\nsanctify his memory. A martyr in what was loudly proclaimed to be\r\nthe cause of God, his countrymen believed that he testified his\r\nunshaken love for those in whose defence he had fallen by miracles\r\nperformed at his tomb, and a regular form of service was composed\r\nfor his worship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICE OF ST.

AMEN.\r\n\r\n  TRANSLATION.--_Anthem._--Rejoice, Thomas, the glory of\r\n  chieftains, the light of Lancaster, who by thy death imitatest\r\n  Thomas of Canterbury; whose head was broken on account of the\r\n  peace of the Church, and thine is cut off for the cause of the\r\n  peace of England; be to us an affectionate guardian in every\r\n  difficulty.\r\n\r\n  _Prayer._ O God, who, for the peace and tranquillity of the\r\n  inhabitants of England, willed that the blessed Thomas thy martyr\r\n  and Earl should fall by the sword of the persecutor, grant\r\n  propitious, that all who devoutly reverence his memory on earth,\r\n  may merit to obtain worthy reward along with him in heaven,\r\n  through our Lord.\r\n\r\n  _Prosa._ The pouring out of prayers to Thomas restores the sick\r\n  to health; the pious Earl comes immediately to the aid of those\r\n  who are feeble; they are relieved from their infirmities by\r\n  the suffrage of one who was infirm. So that it is shown by the\r\n  evidence of the miracles of St. Thomas, that the royal vessel is\r\n  beheaded for the cure of the kingdom. O how the cure of diseases\r\n  declares the sainted leader! Therefore with rejoicing let us sing\r\n  praises to St. Thomas; for he who asks him devoutly, immediately\r\n  without doubt he will return healed.\r\n\r\n  _Sequence._ Let us honour the highest King, for the memory of the\r\n  sweet martyr, whom we join in praising with the utmost reverence.\r\n  He is called Earl Thomas, of an illustrious race; he is condemned\r\n  without cause, who was born of a royal bed. Who when he perceived\r\n  that the whole commons were falling into wreck, did not shrink\r\n  from dying for the right, in the fatal commerce. O royal flower\r\n  of knights, preserve ever from evils this thy family, bringing\r\n  them to glory! AMEN.\r\n\r\n  Declare, my tongue, the martyrdom of the glorious Earl, and\r\n  of the precious blood of Thomas the flower of knights, and of\r\n  the praise of the noble sprout, the light of Earls.--Thomas\r\n  sprang from a royal race by both his parents, whose father\r\n  was the son of a king, and whose mother Navarre raised to be\r\n  a queen.--The faithful leader when he saw that his flock was\r\n  dispersed, and he called to mind that his king was moved with\r\n  jealousy towards him, soon according to the law of the flesh he\r\n  trembled wonderfully.--The blessed man is taken on the vigil of\r\n  St. Benet, on the third day he is suddenly made an unconquered\r\n  champion, he is delivered to dire death, on account of which\r\n  England mourns.--Alas! he is beheaded for the aid of the commons,\r\n  he is deserted by the company of his knights, whilst he is\r\n  treacherously deserted by Robert de Hoyland.--At whose tomb are\r\n  frequently performed miracles; the blind, the lame, the deaf,\r\n  the dumb, and paralytics, by his prayer obtain the help they\r\n  desire.--Praise and honour, virtue and power be to the Trinity,\r\n  Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for ever, which preserve us from sin\r\n  through the intercession of Thomas! AMEN.\r\n\r\n  O now the piety of Christ, and the charity of Thomas, shine\r\n  openly! Alas! equity now pines away, and impiety flourishes,\r\n  truth is made vile! Yet the goodness of Thomas, and his sanctity,\r\n  daily increase; at whose tomb health is given to the sick, that\r\n  the truth may now be clear to all.\r\n\r\n  O Thomas, strenuous champion of plentiful charity, who didst\r\n  combat for the law of England’s liberty, intercede for our sins\r\n  with the Father of Glory, that he may give us a place with the\r\n  blessed in the heavenly court. AMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM PETER LANGTOFT’S CHRONICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE FIRST’S WAR WITH SCOTLAND IN 1294.\r\n\r\n[From a MS. in the Public Library of the University of Cambridge,\r\nGg.

of treason.\r\n\r\n  May Scotland be accursed of the mother of God!--and may Wales\r\n  be sunk down deep to the devil!--In neither of them was there\r\n  ever truth.--For as soon as war was commenced in Wales,--and\r\n  the covenant which had been cut out in Aquitaine--was broken\r\n  and refused by the King of France,--and Edward and Philip\r\n  began hostilities,--the foolish King of Scotland, named John\r\n  Baliol,--who was brought to the kingdom by King Edward,--by\r\n  the seductions of his false baronage,--against his homage and\r\n  against his fealty,--sent messengers to the court of Rome--to\r\n  pope Celestin, who at the time held the see,--by a trick falsely\r\n  showed--that the kingdom of Scotland with the dignity--ought\r\n  to hold of him by testimony of ancient times,--and that King\r\n  Edward by force and might--made him do homage against his\r\n  will;--and prays that he may be absolved and delivered--from\r\n  his faith to the king, to whom he was sworn.--Pope Celestin,\r\n  too unadvised,--absolves the King of Scotland by his bull.--As\r\n  soon as the thing is announced in Scotland,--the barons have\r\n  made to their disgrace--twelve peers of Scotland, and have taken\r\n  counsel--to disinherit Edward of the sovereignty.--For the great\r\n  honour which Edward the prudent--did to John Baliol, such is the\r\n  goodness--with which King Edward--by King John the sleeveless--is\r\n  rewarded.--With Scotland let it be as it may,--it is needful for\r\n  us to complete--the history before mentioned.\r\n\r\n  When Morgan has submitted, and Madoc is taken,--the king\r\n  returns to London by the advice of his friends.--Two cardinals\r\n  of Rome the pope has sent there,--who had talked with the King\r\n  of France at Paris;--the pope has interfered to establish love\r\n  between them.--The cardinals have stated their object to the\r\n  king;--pressingly they have requested Edward and Philip--to\r\n  remain in peace each in his country,--like good people of power\r\n  and value,--who on no side make themselves enemies;--or that the\r\n  pope himself should be their judge,--to effect the reconciliation\r\n  wherever might be the trespass.\r\n\r\n  Whilst the cardinals were talking of the peace,--the people\r\n  of Normandy came to Dover,--along with them were those of\r\n  Calais.--They entered suddenly into the town of Dover,--and\r\n  began to burn a part of the town;--of young and old they killed\r\n  thirteen men.--When they came to the reckoning, they left ten\r\n  for one.--The keeper of the castle and those who remained,--and\r\n  the monks of the cell, who bare themselves well,--took to their\r\n  defence and cried out upon them;--Normans and Picards who had\r\n  put themselves in debt,--were let out of pledge; the hats\r\n  remained--with the heads of some, the others went away.--There\r\n  was a monk in truth, to whom twenty bowed down,--and he absolved\r\n  them all, they knew not a word more.--The cardinals afterwards\r\n  repaired to Paris;--I do not know what answer they carried from\r\n  the king.--Nevertheless divers among them said,--that all the\r\n  conversations would come to this at last,--that Edward and Philip\r\n  should withdraw their people,--so that people should go by sea\r\n  and by land,--in sufferance of peace, as friends could;--the\r\n  English would perform the agreement,--if the Germans would agree\r\n  with them.\r\n\r\n  Whilst the cardinals are interfering--to re-establish the peace,\r\n  and to make the kings friends,--Thomas de Turbevile, who was\r\n  taken at Rion,--has talked so much to the Provost of Paris,--that\r\n  he has done his homage to him, and given as hostages--his two\r\n  sons in keeping, and solemnly promised--to go to England to\r\n  spy the country,--and to say to King Edward that he came a\r\n  fugitive--escaped from prison among his enemies.--The Provost\r\n  agreed to it, and put in his writing--a hundred pounds of land\r\n  on such a devise;--and Thomas pledges on the Gospels,--that all\r\n  England, and Wales and the Marches,--and all who are of value in\r\n  the kingdom of Scotland,--shall bow to Philip the son of Louis.\r\n\r\n  Hear now how the grace of Jesus Christ--warned the gentle King\r\n  Edward of the treason.--Thomas came to England and said to the\r\n  king,--that he had escaped out of prison by night,--and that he\r\n  had run so great a risk out of love to Sir Edward.--The king\r\n  showed him in return courtesy enough;--and afterwards Turbeville\r\n  inquired day by day--the state of the land, and provided for his\r\n  going--from place to place to seek of great and of little,--how\r\n  he could do such injury to the English,--that King Edward\r\n  should lose his land.--The condition of every part, as he\r\n  understood it,--he sent over with the cardinals by one of his\r\n  own servants--to the Provost of Paris, who made joy enough about\r\n  it.--The clerk who wrote the letter for Turbeville,--made known\r\n  its contents to the king’s most secret counsellor.--The thief\r\n  got to know this, and immediately took to flight;--a serjeant at\r\n  arms, who followed him very closely,--surprised Turbeville the\r\n  third day after.\r\n\r\n  The traitor is taken, and brought to London,--with very great\r\n  wickedness which was found upon him.--The things which are\r\n  aforesaid, which he had agreed to do,--by the king’s will are put\r\n  under foot,--until the world is otherwise turned.--Turbeville is\r\n  judged in the court as a traitor;--he was first drawn through\r\n  the town of London,--and then hanged like a thief, for his\r\n  malpractices.--For our King Edward God has interfered much--now\r\n  and at other times for his safety.\r\n\r\n  When vengeance is done upon Turbeville,--the cardinals of Rome,\r\n  who had repaired to France--have had frequent conversation with\r\n  King Philip,--and have often besought the King of Germany,--and\r\n  have demonstrated by clerks and laymen--to the gentle King\r\n  Edward, that the variance is hard--about which he and King Philip\r\n  are at discord;--whereby they have so ordained the matter,--that\r\n  he and the two kings shall send without delay--to Cambrai clerks\r\n  and laymen of great knowledge,--to treat of the peace, and to\r\n  judge the grievances,--and to make the amends for the war.--King\r\n  Edward agrees to it with good faith;--to Cambrai he has sent\r\n  without any delay--bishops and barons of great account.--May God\r\n  by his power guard them from treason!\r\n\r\n  While these lords are gone upon this message,--Sir Edward the\r\n  brother of the King of gentle spirit,--the Earl of Lincoln with\r\n  all his retainers,--Sir William de Vescy, a good and prudent\r\n  knight,--barons and vavasors of gentle lineage,--knights\r\n  and sergeants with their cousinage,--footmen without number\r\n  from moor and wood,--and Welshmen who know how to fight from\r\n  frequent practice,--are gone into Gascony, and entered on the\r\n  passage,--with thirty-six banners of the best escuage--that\r\n  was in England, except the vassalage--of those who now\r\n  perform their seignorage.--For those who are left to guard\r\n  their inheritance,--the king has required and taken into\r\n  his expedition--against the King of Scotland and his false\r\n  baronage,--who have withdrawn their homage from King Edward.--The\r\n  first day of March, in all the great storm,--comes King Edward\r\n  with very great purveyance,--to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for the\r\n  great outrage--which the wicked dogs have effected in their\r\n  folly.--May our King Edward suffer the “male rage,”--if he does\r\n  not take them and hold them so fast in cage,--that nothing shall\r\n  remain after his taillage,--except only their rivelings and their\r\n  bare backsides.\r\n\r\n  Robert de Ros of Wark fled from the English,--and entered into\r\n  the war with the people of Scotland.--The King Sir Edward seized\r\n  his castle,--held the festival of Easter there, and afterwards\r\n  went--towards Berwick-on-Tweed, and besieged the town.--The\r\n  ill-fated people at first surprised--two ships of English, and\r\n  put them to death.--King Edward heard of it, and attacked the\r\n  gates;--the English passed the ditches without respite.--On\r\n  Easter Friday in the afternoon he conquered--the town of Berwick;\r\n  the English slew there--four thousand Scotchmen, and many others\r\n  perished.--Sir Edward lost there one knight and no more,--Richard\r\n  de Cornwall [was he], a Fleming struck him--with an arrow which\r\n  he shot out of the red hall.--Soon was the hall taken, the\r\n  fire cleared the way.--The keeper of the castle when he saw\r\n  the necessity,--delivered the castle to King Edward before it\r\n  was assaulted.--William Douglas was chosen in it,--and Richard\r\n  Fraser, to do injury to the king;--the king has them prisoners.\r\n  Jesus Christ be thanked!\r\n\r\n  The Earl of the March, the famous Patrick,--of his own free\r\n  will came in to the king’s peace;--Gilbert de Umfraville before\r\n  remained--with King Edward, to whom he was sworn;--Sir Robert\r\n  de Bruce with all his household--holds always his fealty to\r\n  King Edward,--and has shown him love in his wars against the\r\n  Scots.--When Berwick was taken, there was found within it--gold\r\n  and silver without measure, and plenty of the other metals,--and\r\n  all the nobility which belonged to a city.--The Baliol has\r\n  lost the issue and entry--of the noblest town that was in his\r\n  power.--King Edward holds it conquered by the sword,--causes\r\n  it to be surrounded with a ditch large and broad,--in reproof\r\n  of the Scot who had sung of him,--and made rhymes in English\r\n  for mockery.--Let him pike and let him dike,--they said in\r\n  scorn,--how it may best be.--He pikes and he dikes,--in\r\n  length as he likes,--as they may best see.--Scattered are the\r\n  Scots,--huddled in their huts,--they never thrive:--Right if I\r\n  read,--they tumble in Tweed--who dwelt by the sea.\r\n\r\n  Whilst Sir Edward with earls and barons--caused Berwick to be\r\n  surrounded with ditches,--there are issued from Scotland three\r\n  earls, by name--Mar, Ross, and Menteith, with forty thousand\r\n  rascals;--they were going in the route in parties,--they reduced\r\n  Tindale to ashes and cinders,--the town of Corbridge and the\r\n  two monasteries--of Hexham and Lanercost they have destroyed\r\n  by fire,--they have made slaughter of the people of the\r\n  country,--carried off their goods, driven away the canons.--After\r\n  the ravage like fools and miserable wretches--they are gone to\r\n  Dunbar to their confusion.--They have taken the castle, and erect\r\n  their tents,--the houses belonged to the Earl of the March.--King\r\n  Edward heard tell of it, and issued summonses--to recover Dunbar,\r\n  and take the thieves--who had made destruction of holy church.--A\r\n  little before this time, through the regions,--the cardinal\r\n  returned from Cambrai with an answer--of the King of France, as\r\n  we shall hear afterwards;--Sire Amy de Savoy, a count of great\r\n  renown,--came in his company, and Otho de Grauntsoun.--The\r\n  latter came with his companions from Cyprus,--who, when Acres\r\n  was taken, escaped--by passing the neighbouring sea, without\r\n  other accidents.--I have told you before what evil and what\r\n  destruction--were done to holy church wrongfully and without\r\n  reason;--and you have often heard in the holy sermons--that God\r\n  is just in all his dealings:--Now hear of Dunbar, where without\r\n  evasions--the enemies of God are caught in a fold like sheep.\r\n\r\n  On the first Monday in the month of May,--at Berwick-upon-Tweed\r\n  the king heard say,--how the foolish rascals, who had\r\n  burnt--Hexham and Lanercost, nor spared the monasteries,--had\r\n  taken Dunbar, the castle by the sea,--where the Earl Patrick\r\n  kept his wife.--The King Sir Edward forthwith caused to be\r\n  sent there--the Earl of Warenne with all his power,--the Earl\r\n  of Warwick and Hugh le Despenser,--barons and vavasours,\r\n  knights, squires;--Southerns and Northerns went there right\r\n  courageously;--they take there footmen enough for their\r\n  need,--and come to Dunbar to besiege the castle.--They prepared\r\n  for the attack, and would not delay.--The foolish felons within\r\n  hoped to have aid;--they plotted together how to trick the\r\n  English.--Sir Richard Syward, who used to dwell--with our King\r\n  Edward, at robe and pay,--they send deceitfully to treat with our\r\n  English;--so he comes to them, and says, that very willingly--he\r\n  will cause the castle to be delivered to them, if they will\r\n  grant--three days’ respite, that they may consult--the King\r\n  Baliol, and tell him their condition.--And if he at that time\r\n  do not come to raise the siege,--they will deliver the castle\r\n  without further delay.--Forthwith he gives hostages, and causes\r\n  to be announced--to the host of Scotland in the same manner,--as\r\n  you will hear after, he caused it to be recorded.\r\n\r\n  The messenger goes, and soon came to--King John and to the host\r\n  which was with him,--he said to them as Siward had instructed\r\n  him:--“Sir King, your barons remain in hard strait--in the castle\r\n  of Dunbar, in danger of being driven out.--For when King Edward\r\n  knew of their being there,--he caused part of his host to be\r\n  sent thither.--The Englishman, when he came there, besieged the\r\n  castle.--Sir Richard Siward, who knew them all,--issued from the\r\n  castle, and talked them over so well,--that the English gave him\r\n  a truce for three days.--Wherefore the company, who were there on\r\n  your part,--commanded me to go to you as to their lord,--and to\r\n  say truly, that the man neither sits nor goes,--who can hinder\r\n  your coming, unless by some deceit,--within the term of truce\r\n  which the English has granted us.--To-morrow at the hour when\r\n  people eat and drink,--go hence hastily straight there;--ours\r\n  in the castle will watch for you;--they will issue upon the\r\n  English who do not expect their coming,--entrap them between you\r\n  and hold them so tight,--that they shall no more come in the\r\n  field to do annoyance to yours.--You have no other way that will\r\n  avail you.--Now arm, and let us go, and may no soul survive--who\r\n  shall have any mercy on our enemies when they are taken!--Strike\r\n  with the sword--Northumberland--will be yours by right;--All\r\n  England--by this war--you will that it be lost:--Never did\r\n  Albania--by stroke of the sword--do so great an exploit.”--On the\r\n  green--that keen generation--gathered like goats;--I reckon--on\r\n  some it is seen,--where the bit bit.\r\n\r\n  At the saying of the messenger the rout of vagabonds--begin to\r\n  arrange themselves in order of battle.--Sir Richard Siward, who\r\n  gave this counsel,--comes to the English, and says, “God help\r\n  me!--I see people coming in very great apparel,--as though they\r\n  would give battle, without number of footmen.--I go, if you think\r\n  well, to hinder them,--that they may not come nearer.”--Our\r\n  people say, “Do not trouble yourself!”--And they take Siward,\r\n  that he may proceed no further;--they place guards at the gate\r\n  and at the wall;--Humphrey de Bohun the younger is keeper of\r\n  the guard,--to hinder aid from the castle from attacking their\r\n  rear;--and they mount their steeds, and spur to the hill;--he who\r\n  can run fastest springs before the others.--The Scot sees them\r\n  come, and turns his tail like a quail,--he flies away as straw\r\n  does before the wind.--The English pursue them like a sheep--when\r\n  it flies at the sight of the wolf issuing from the wood.--The\r\n  proud Scot imagines that he is as good as--the Duke Sir Corineus,\r\n  who conquered Cornwall.--Of so many men at arms I marvel very\r\n  much--that there is not one of them all worth a farthing in\r\n  action,--except Patrick de Graham, who remains and strikes--with\r\n  the burnished sword, but he is slain without fail.--Ten thousand\r\n  and fifty-four are slain in the engagement;--they are all Scots,\r\n  I have the number by reckoning.--These were the caitiffs who\r\n  butchered the cattle--in Northumberland, and left the entrails to\r\n  the dogs.--They were excommunicated by book and candle,--because\r\n  neither holy church nor priest or clergy--they spared no more\r\n  than bake-house or barn.--Sin has driven them to such a hap--that\r\n  they have lost in the field the head with the ears.--The\r\n  foot-people--put the Scots in the poke,--and made bare their\r\n  backsides:--By way--heard I never tell--of readier pages,--to\r\n  pick--the robes off the men,--who in the field fell.--They took\r\n  of each man;--the rough ragged devil--tear them in hell!\r\n\r\n  In battle or encounter it was never recorded--that so many\r\n  people were destroyed so soon,--or thus turned their backs\r\n  without making any defence.--May the crows have the bodies,\r\n  and the devils the souls--of all that thus have conducted the\r\n  wars!--For of this part there was never once,--within town or\r\n  without, a good action proved,--but only prowling and robbing\r\n  the towns,--burning holy church, killing the clergy,--may God\r\n  be praised who has revenged it at Dunbar!--The earls who had\r\n  done the wicked deeds,--as soon as they knew and were aware--of\r\n  the defeat of their kindred,--have delivered the castle to\r\n  the English on their return,--and without conditions obliged\r\n  themselves--to the King Sir Edward, to do his will.--The king\r\n  next day came there to his baronage,--the prisoners who are taken\r\n  they have presented to him,--three earls, three barons, three\r\n  bannerets,--and besides them twenty-eight dubbed knights,--with\r\n  five score gentlemen who were found there;--two clerks and\r\n  two Picards are counted among them.--The Earls are sent to\r\n  the Tower of London.--Some of the barons are associated with\r\n  them;--the others are sent to different castles,--two by two\r\n  mounted together on a hackney;--some with their feet fettered\r\n  in carts;--in such kind of dance their game ended!--Throughout\r\n  England in every country--people will always talk of their\r\n  pride--as long as the world lasts, people have scoffed at\r\n  their action.--For the Scots--I reckon for sots,--and wretches\r\n  unwary;--ill luck--to give blows--drew them to Dunbar.\r\n\r\n  Now it is time to tell the plot--of the twelve peers of Scotland,\r\n  who thought surely--to destroy England, I will just tell you\r\n  how.--When the King of France, after the breaking off--of that\r\n  marriage which was often talked of,--would retain Gascony by\r\n  abatement,--and King Edward sent thither his people,--and re-took\r\n  a part by war from the French;--King John of Scotland, by the\r\n  enticement--of earls and barons, and of clerks also,--sent\r\n  to France by common agreement--the bishop of St. Andrew’s,\r\n  by whose procurement--the brother of the King of France,\r\n  namely, Charles,--made an alliance for the son of the King of\r\n  Scotland,--who was to marry his daughter, and afterwards by\r\n  oath--the French and Scots should go conjointly--into England\r\n  to destroy from the Tweed to Kent;--and that the King of France\r\n  should land,--when he would, suddenly in the Tweed,--forthwith\r\n  he should suddenly take all Northumberland,--and then all the\r\n  land without hindrance;--that he should not leave a man alive,\r\n  neither father nor kindred.--The traitorous negotiation being\r\n  entered upon without completion,--the seneschal of Scotland\r\n  is come in without more ado--to the King Sir Edward, with all\r\n  that belongs to him,--earls and barons and bishops fully,--are\r\n  come to his peace all at his desire.--King John and his son,\r\n  without land or tenement,--are led to London to support\r\n  judgment.--Now King Edward possesses Scotland entirely,--like\r\n  Albanac had it at the beginning.--The Welsh and Irish--to\r\n  our English--aid doughtily.--Whereby the Scots--have through\r\n  ours--imprisonment;--and that land--by this war--is lost for\r\n  ever.--The Welsh are gone home,--and the Irish returned--with\r\n  sail and with wind.--You English remain there;--you ought to pray\r\n  devoutly--that the Lord God forbid,--to take Aman into favour\r\n  again,--and exile Mardocheus,--in royal parliament.--Edward,\r\n  amid all your accusations,--please to remember the burnings,--of\r\n  the temple of God Almighty,--at Hexham, where that host--of\r\n  the cross made roast,--the figure of human salvation.--Herod\r\n  strikes there, the child dies,--in this anguish Rachael\r\n  weeps;--Edward, wreak vengeance for it.--Thou wilt be judge,\r\n  judge according to right;--let him hang who ought to hang,--the\r\n  law wills it certainly.--The punishment is hard and cruel,--for\r\n  it is everlasting,--for all who give judgment otherwise.--Now\r\n  chastise your enemies,--that they may not stir again--in a new\r\n  mischief.--We ought to have mercy;--but that ought not to avail a\r\n  traitor,--there the law suspends it.--For love nor for pence,--a\r\n  king ought not to spare,--so as not to judge equally.--If the\r\n  king will serve God,--it is right he should maintain the law;--if\r\n  he does not, he sins and errs very much.--In truth when John\r\n  Baliol--left his book at school,--he was too ill deceived.--¶\r\n  For bale bred in his book,--when he lost what he took--with the\r\n  kingdom;--for he has over-hopped,--his tippet is tipped,--his\r\n  tabard is empty.--He laughed while it pleased him,--his pack (?)\r\n  is pierced through,--he thought he was loyal;--....\r\n\r\n  Pride in a country, is like a nettle in the garden,--which\r\n  overgrows the rose and pushes it back;--so it is with Baliol,\r\n  that, by him the twelve peers--are fallen down for their wicked\r\n  proceeding,--he has lost his realm, and is gone to lodge--in the\r\n  Tower of London, at another’s expense.--The King Sir Edward makes\r\n  guard enough;--the Earl John de Warenne is chief justice,--and\r\n  Henry de Percy has Galway to rule;--at Berwick-upon-Tweed is\r\n  established the exchequer,--and Hugh de Cressingham is treasurer\r\n  there;--and Walter de Amundisham is chancellor.--The King to\r\n  nourish the peace causes his bench to be proclaimed there,--and\r\n  five judges to govern the law.--Sheriffs and bailiffs are\r\n  established for the need--of the English who could and would\r\n  judge according to right.--The guard is established so good and\r\n  so perfect,--neither Fleming nor Frenchman henceforth shall\r\n  have the power,--to enter into Scotland, unless it be for\r\n  commerce.--Of all those of most account who were to remain--the\r\n  homages are taken, the King makes them swear--that they will\r\n  be loyal by land and by sea.--They who began the war and the\r\n  advisers of it--are sent beyond the Trent to repose in the\r\n  south,--so long as the war lasts in Gascony.--Thus ought the lord\r\n  to chastise his men.--The bishop of Durham, who did much worthy\r\n  of praise,--in conquering the land was always the first,--were\r\n  it not for his activity and boldness of heart,--things now\r\n  finished would be to begin.--The twelve peers--go away to\r\n  the friars--to confess them,--the judgment--which awaits\r\n  them--they may fear.--Kambynoy--holds himself all coy,--he\r\n  will not help.--The sorcery--of Albania--cannot avail.--Andrew\r\n  sleeps,--or he is dead--at the monastery.--What will the Scot\r\n  do,--when he will hear--the King talk,--at St. Edmund’s,--and\r\n  of treason--accuse--earl and baron,--who by burning--destroys\r\n  the altar?--He can go no further,--there he must--stand like a\r\n  thief;--and by judgment--King Edward--determine.--And so may\r\n  man teach--the Scots to run,--and begin war.--To some is left\r\n  nothing--but his torn riveling--to hop therein.--Their King’s\r\n  seat of Scone--is driven over down,--and led to London.--In town\r\n  I heard tell,--the ... and the bell--are stolen and fled.\r\n\r\n  O God! how often Merlin said truth--in his prophecies! As you\r\n  read,--now are the two waters come into one,--which have been\r\n  separated by great mountains; and one realm is made out of two\r\n  different kingdoms,--which used to be governed by two kings.--Now\r\n  are the islanders all brought together,--and Albania is\r\n  rejoined to its regalities,--of which King Edward is proclaimed\r\n  lord;--Cornwall and Wales are in his power,--and Ireland the\r\n  great is at his will.--There is no longer any king of all the\r\n  countries--except King Edward who has thus visited them.--Arthur\r\n  had never so fully the feudalities.--Henceforth he has nothing\r\n  to do but to look after his goings,--to conquer his inheritance\r\n  from the King of France,--and then to carry the cross where Jesus\r\n  Christ was born.--His enemies,--thank God!--are chastised;--they\r\n  are all vanquished,--and taken like rats,--and bound.--He has\r\n  run about--and fought--quite enough,--with two kings--at one\r\n  time,--and overthrown them;--the one on this side--now goes\r\n  to that side--with his baronage.--John and Thomas--will not\r\n  leave him--unassisted;--Cuthbert comes to him,--who holds\r\n  with him--in the combats.--In God, I tell you,--Merlin of\r\n  him--prophesied;--three regions--in his possession--shall be\r\n  gained.--Let not be blamed--the prophecy--sinfully;--Lord\r\n  God Almighty,--at St. Edmund’s at the parliament--give him\r\n  counsel.--And on false Philip of France--by thy virtue to have\r\n  vengeance,--that he may never be advanced--for his mere falseness.\r\n\r\n  To the borough of St. Edmund, on the day which was fixed,--are\r\n  come the bishops, with the company--of laymen and clerks,\r\n  of whom the king prays--aid and courtesy of the goods of\r\n  holy church,--as they had promised before in the abbey--of\r\n  Westminster, whereby the king trusts to it--for the help of\r\n  his war which is not finished.--Earls and barons, with the\r\n  knights,--for themselves and for the people grant in aid--the\r\n  tenth penny, and for the merchants--the seventh part for the aid\r\n  of his treasury.--And the archbishop, who holds the primacy--of\r\n  the see of Canterbury, studies for an answer,--and explains to\r\n  the king by two bishops--the condition of holy church, which is\r\n  much impoverished.--The bishop afterwards goes to the king and\r\n  says,--“Sire, for God’s sake, do not grieve yourself at all about\r\n  that,--for all holy church, I certify thee,--under God there is\r\n  no soul alive in the world--who has over holy church power or\r\n  mastery,--except the pope of Rome, who holds the vicary--which\r\n  St. Peter the apostle had in keeping.--The pope is our head, he\r\n  keeps and rules us,--and he has made a statute which binds us\r\n  closely,--on privation of rent and of prelacy,--that neither\r\n  tenth, nor twentieth, nor half, nor part--none of us give to thee\r\n  or to any other,--without his commandment and allowance,--upon\r\n  it he solemnly excommunicates and curses--every son of a mother\r\n  that by lordship--injures holy church, which may God help in\r\n  its freedom!”--“Sir clerk,” said the King, “thou hast talked\r\n  folly;--promise is debt due, if faith be not forgotten;--but if\r\n  I saw thee here in possession of the bull--as well as all the\r\n  others, by the son of Mary!--you should not be relieved of this\r\n  aid.”\r\n\r\n  “Sire,” said the Archbishop, “very willingly--thee as our lord\r\n  we will all aid--with the leave of the pope, if thou wilt send\r\n  to him--by one of thy clerks with our messenger,--who could\r\n  relate to him thy condition and ours;--and according to the\r\n  message which the pope shall send us back,--we will as far as\r\n  our abilities go courteously aid thee.”--“Sir clerk,” says the\r\n  King again, “I have no need--for thee to advise me to consult\r\n  the pope;--but if thou wilt have respite in this case,--cause\r\n  thy clerks to assemble when thou wilt,--talk to them of\r\n  the promise, and treat heartily of it;--after St. Hilary’s\r\n  day come to Westminster,--and make the answer without more\r\n  talk!”--“Sire,” said the Archbishop, “for the sake of God and\r\n  St. Richard!--please to command here and there thy people,--who\r\n  are thy agents for the twelfth penny,--that they cause to be\r\n  molested neither us nor our tenants,--nor tax our temporalities\r\n  along with the layman.”--“Sir,” answers the King, “you need not\r\n  fear it,--for they shall do neither well nor ill to none of\r\n  thy power.--Nevertheless, fair Sir, I pray and require,--that\r\n  throughout thy diocese thou commandest to pray--for me and mine,\r\n  and to thank God,--who has done largely for us in our recent\r\n  affairs.”--The Archbishop grants it, and does his duty.--A little\r\n  before this time returned the treasurer--Walter de Langton,\r\n  who had passed the sea--with the cardinal, to treat of the\r\n  peace.--The answer which they bring no man can know,--except\r\n  those of the council who dare not reveal it.--Messengers\r\n  afterwards came to announce--to the King Sir Edward a form of\r\n  arranging--the strife of Gascony, and to cause him to agree--with\r\n  King Philip, without further war,--as the cardinals had caused\r\n  it to be ordained.--King Edward forthwith sent back--Walter de\r\n  Langton and Hugh le Despenser,--and John de Berwick, a clerk and\r\n  a valiant knight.--May God conduct them there, and bring them\r\n  well back again!\r\n\r\n  Of the barons of Scotland, at this parliament--reason was not\r\n  rendered, nor judgment given.--The King is so courteous, so\r\n  full of pity,--and of so great mercy, I believe certainly--that\r\n  his mercy will be the saving--of those who have fully\r\n  deserved death,--by their deeds attainted of felony.--The\r\n  great pity of heart which he has often had--upon the felons\r\n  of Wales, every body talks of it;--when he was most occupied\r\n  for his advancement,--they made war upon him, and cause a\r\n  diversion,--whereby he was obliged to leave his goings elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  After the day of St. Hilary, when the King thought (to\r\n  hold)--parliament at London, as he had ordained,--news came to\r\n  him by him who was then--come from Cambrai, and announced to\r\n  him--that the talk of peace was made with no intention of coming\r\n  to an end.--Wherefore King Edward remained and prepared--by\r\n  sea and by land that he might not be betrayed;--at Westminster\r\n  he collected his people--to treat about what aid the clergy\r\n  should give him.--The Lord of Canterbury held himself very\r\n  rigid on this matter,--he vowed to St. Thomas for him and his\r\n  parish,--that no one of his church should be any more taxed,--nor\r\n  placed in servage as long as he lived,--without command of the\r\n  pope, who ought to govern them.--The Lord of Lincoln agreed to\r\n  this,--Bishop Oliver, who was not used to bend.--The King was\r\n  so enraged against the clergy,--that he commanded them to be\r\n  judged out of his peace.--But now afterwards he repealed that\r\n  decree.--This did those bishops who willingly consented--to aid\r\n  their lord whereby to recover his right,--to defend holy church\r\n  from shame and loss.--The elect of York, who desired peace,--said\r\n  that willingly as far as concerned him--he would give the fifth\r\n  penny wherewith to defend holy church.--Not a soul spoke there\r\n  of the caitiff Scots:--they remained in keeping in the same\r\n  care,--as they were before, Dunbar caused them vexation.--For\r\n  there were they burnt ...--he ... them thither,--and drove to\r\n  dote.--For Scots at Dunbar--had at their ...--shame of their\r\n  note.--Never were dogs there--hurled out of....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE TRAILEBASTONS, AND EXECUTION OF WALLACE.\r\n\r\n[From MS.

the eighteenth volume of\r\nthe Histoire Littéraire de France, pp. 671-682. His name is of\r\nfrequent occurrence in the English rolls and charters of the reigns\r\nof John and Henry III.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 20, _laxait Bordelois_.--Alphonso VIII. King of Castille,\r\nmarried Alianor, daughter of Henry II. of England, and in her right\r\nhe claimed Gascony, in opposition to King John, and invaded it. In\r\n1206, he laid siege to Bourdeaux. See Dom. Bouquet, Collect. des\r\nHistoriens de France, tom. xviii. p. 245.\r\n\r\n_P._ 3, _l._ 2, _lois_ is the Latin _laudes_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 19, _par presen_.--It has been suggested that this may\r\nmean _as though he were present_; but I think the translation\r\nadopted is preferable.\r\n\r\n_P._ 4, _l._ 6, _Lo rei Richard_.--Richard I. was in Aquitaine when\r\nhe received the wound which caused his death.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 17, _Lozoics ... Guillelme ... ad Aurenga_.--The\r\nallusion, I suppose, is to the inedited romance of Guillaume\r\nd’Orange.\r\n\r\n_P._ 5, _l._ 20, _Cadoing_.--Perhaps _Cadomum_, or Caen, as\r\nhere translated. But there was also a place called Cadoing near\r\nPérigueux, which had a celebrated abbey.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, as a peculiar characteristic of the Provençal\r\nsongs of this class, that the poet generally introduces an address\r\nto a lady, although she has nothing to do with the subject.\r\n\r\n_P._ 6, _l._ 11. SONG ON THE BISHOPS.--Since this part of the\r\nvolume was printed, I have found among the manuscripts of the\r\nBritish Museum (MS. Reg. 7 F, V, fol. 1, r^o, written in a\r\ncontemporary hand) a copy of this song, containing important\r\nvariations, which would have enabled me to give the text more\r\ncorrectly. In this manuscript the lines are arranged thus in each\r\nstanza:--\r\n\r\n      Complange tuum, Anglia, melos suspendens organi;\r\n      Et maxime tu, Cantia, de mora tui Stephani.\r\n      Thomam habes sed alterum, secundum habes iterum\r\n      Stephanum, qui trans hominem induens fortitudinem signa facit\r\n            in populo.\r\n      Dolos doles metropolis quos subdoli parturiunt,\r\n      Orbata tuis incolis, dolose quos ejiciunt,\r\n      Largos emittis gemitus, patre privata penitus.\r\n      Sed cum habebis Stephanum, assumes tibi tympanum, chelym\r\n            tangens sub modulo.\r\n\r\nThe following are the various readings offered by this MS.--_P._\r\n6, _l._ 1, _tuum_.--_P._ 7, _l._ 4, _doles_.--15, _vel\r\nlegem_.--17, _quis Nathan David_.--19, _vel postibus_.--21, _jam\r\nliberetur_.--_P._ 8, _l._ 2, _exurge_.--4, _ancilla_.--5, _jam\r\nsuperductis aliam_.--7, _Portæ prævalent inferi_, with _Tartari_\r\nwritten over the last word.--8, _nam ludo_.--16, _Scriptis_\r\nomitted.--19, _Patet interpretatio | et arduis et infimis, | Nam\r\nregni_, &c.--_P._ 9, _l._ 2, _et sacerdos_, with _et_ erased and\r\n_nam_ written over it.--3, _concurrit ad_.--7, _sudet_.--12,\r\n_eos_.--15, _et deicit_.--20, _debent et suum fundere_.--22,\r\n_jactant_.--_P._ 10, _l._ 8, _in hac_.--11, _clamet_.--16,\r\n_dum_.--17, _perit_.--20, _sedet ad_.--22, _Euvangelium_.--23,\r\nafter this line should come the following, _Ad nummos vertit\r\noculum_.--_P._ 11, _l._ 1, _lucro lucam_.--2, _Marcum marca_.--3,\r\n_librum libra_.--8, _Amplectuntur_.--13, _sunt appositi | Sed\r\nlonge_.--20, _ob hoc_.--_P._ 12, _l._ 1, _In canes nostri_.--10,\r\n_Eliensis_.--11, _datus_.--12, _Eli et ensis_.--14, _Elios_.--16,\r\n_Et Babilonis_.--19, _Wlstani_.--_P._ 13, _l._ 1, _Wlstani_.--4,\r\n_Effot, mitram, et anulum_.--8, _et_ is omitted.--9, _Hinc est, et\r\nhinc a latere | Et pauper_.--13, _non causatur_.--14, _des. Cantia_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 16, _tui Stephani_.--Stephen Langton, whom the Pope had\r\nappointed to the archbishopric of Canterbury, in opposition to the\r\nelection of the monks and the King. He was archbishop from 1207 to\r\n1229.\r\n\r\n_P._ 7, _l._ 17, _natum_ should be _Nathan_; see the above various\r\nreadings for this as well as for some other necessary corrections,\r\nwhich would have rendered the translation less difficult.\r\n\r\n_P._ 8, _l._ 3, _Agar ... filium_.--The marginal note in Flacius\r\nsays, Joannem Graye Episcopum Nordovicensem intelligit. It is not\r\nsaid whether these side-notes are given from the MS. which Flacius\r\nused, or are of his own making.\r\n\r\n_P._ 8, _l._ 14.--The same side-notes tell us the _scribentem\r\ndigitum_ means the Pope--Papam intelligit.\r\n\r\n_P._ 9, _l._ 12, _Non est qui_.--The allusion, according to the\r\nside-note, is to Pandulph the legate. This explanation is, however,\r\nrather doubtful.\r\n\r\n_P._ 10, _l._ 1, _præsuli Bathoniæ_.--Joceline de Welles, Bishop\r\nof Bath and Wells from 1205 to 1242. He fled out of England with\r\nthe Bishops of London, Ely, and Worcester, who had published the\r\ninterdict.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _Norwicensis bestia_.--John Graye, Bishop of Norwich,\r\nwho was designed by the King to the see of Canterbury. The three\r\nBishops who took part with the King, whom Matthew Paris calls “tres\r\nepiscopi curiales,” were those of Norwich, Winchester, and Durham.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 15, _Cato quondam tertius_.--I do not quite understand the\r\nallusion. It occurs again at the end of the _Apocalypsis Goliæ_--\r\n\r\n      De cælo cecidi ut Cato tertius,\r\n      Nec summi venio secreti nuncius,\r\n      Sed meus michi quod inscripsit socius,\r\n      Hoc vobis dicere possum fidelius.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 19, _Wintoniensis armiger_.--Peter de Rupibus, Bishop\r\nof Winchester, from 1204 to 1238. He was a native of Poitiers in\r\nFrance, and had been a knight before his consecration. He, with\r\nthe Bishops of Durham and Norwich, supported the party of the King\r\nagainst the Pope. In 1214 he was made chief-justice of England, and\r\nhe was protector of the realm during the minority of Henry III. See\r\n_Godwin, de Præsulibus_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 11, _l._ 1, _lucro Lucam ... Marco marcam ... libræ\r\nlibrum_.--These puns are frequently repeated in the satirical\r\npoetry of the thirteenth century. They will be found further on in\r\nthe present volume, pp. 16 and 31, as well as in some of the poems\r\nof Walter Mapes. Giraldus Cambrensis uses a similar pun in relating\r\nhis journey to Rome, where he says he differed in one particular\r\nfrom others who went there, for he offered _libros, non libras_.\r\n_Libra_ in the song should probably be translated _a pound_, as at\r\np. 31, not _the scales_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 12, _l._ 1, _Joannes ... decanus_.--For Joannes, the King’s\r\nMS. has _canes_, which is perhaps right, as _canus_ and _canit_ in\r\nthe following line seem to be continued puns upon the word.\r\n\r\n_P._ 12, _l._ 10, _Heliensis_.--Eustace, Bishop of Ely, from\r\n1197 to 1214. As has been observed, he was one of the three who\r\npublished the pope’s interdict.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 19, _Wolstani subambule_.--Maugerius, Bishop of\r\nWorcester, from 1200 to 1212. He was also one of those who\r\npublished the interdict, and having like the others fled to the\r\nContinent, he died in exile at Pontiniac, in 1212. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to observe that St. Wolstan had held the see of Worcester\r\nin the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n_P._ 13, _l._ 6, _De Roffensi episcopo_.--Gilbert de Glanville,\r\nBishop of Rochester, from 1185 to 1214. Between him and his monks\r\nthere was perpetual contention, and he diminished much the goods of\r\nhis church. See Godwin.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _pauper Sarisburiæ_.--Robert, Bishop of Salisbury,\r\nwho seems to have lived in obscurity. Godwin says he could find no\r\nother information relating to him, except the date of his being\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 15, _I Romam_.--Flacius Illyricus gives here the\r\nfollowing side-note--“Golias ad librum, vel Gualterus Mapes.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 14, _l._ 6-10.--This information is conveyed in two side-notes\r\nin Flacius Illyricus, who has printed this Song imperfectly; but\r\nwhether these notes were composed by the editor, or found in the\r\nmanuscript, we are not told. There are no circumstances in the\r\nSong itself which would lead us to fix it to this date rather than\r\nto any other in the first half of the thirteenth century. The two\r\nnotes are at the beginning,--“Leo, Joannes Rex; aselli, episcopi\r\nsunt;”--and at the end, “Jupiter Rex Joannes est: Pluto, Romanus\r\npontifex.” On reference, however, to Bale, I find that he speaks of\r\nMapes as calling King John sometimes a lion and sometimes Jupiter,\r\nand as designating the Pope by the name of Pluto, and the bishops\r\nas asses, which seems to prove that he had read these side-notes,\r\nperhaps in the manuscript from which Flacius’s transcript was made.\r\nIt is not indeed improbable that the latter obtained it from Bale\r\nhimself, who was perhaps the author of the side-notes.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 11, SONG ON THE TIMES.--Flacius has printed this Song\r\nin his _Varia Doctorum, etc. Poemata_, p. 406, with the omission\r\nof the three first stanzas, which he had previously given as a\r\nseparate song at p. 159. The text now printed is made up from a\r\ncomparison of the manuscript with the printed text. The variations\r\nare as follows:--_L._ 1, _utor_, Flacius.--3, _deaurati belli_,\r\nFl.--9, _Facies in opere_, MS.--10, _Tegunt partem an._, Fl.--_P._\r\n15, _l._ 2, _congruit ramum in_, Fl.--3, _caput mundi_, Fl.--5,\r\n_Trahit enim ... et sec._, Fl.--7, _singula_, Fl.--9, _Romæ sunt\r\nv._, Fl.--11, _In hoc cons._, Fl.--17, _petunt quando petis_,\r\nFl.--18, _seminas, eadem tu metis_, Fl.--_P._ 16, _l._ 4, _Munus\r\nal. pollet sing._, Fl.--6, _rot. placet, totum pl._, Fl.--7, _Et c.\r\nita pl. ...

The poem was\r\nevidently written by a strong partizan of the Pope.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _truces_.--The MS. has _traces_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 15, &c.--Louis and his party were at London, which they\r\nquitted in the November after King John’s death, in order to\r\nmarch towards the North. On the 6th December they took Hertford\r\nCastle, and that of Berkhampstead on the 20th, and proceeded to St.\r\nAlban’s. A truce was then agreed to, which continued till after\r\nEaster.\r\n\r\n_P._ 24, _l._ 2, _Montique Sorello_.--When hostilities recommenced,\r\nthe Barons of the king’s party laid siege to Mount Sorrel, in\r\nLincolnshire, but were obliged to retreat by the approach of a part\r\nof the army of Louis under the command of the Comte de Perche.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _Cestrensis clipeus_.--Ranulph de Blundeville, Earl of\r\nChester, one of the most powerful Barons on the king’s party, who\r\nnow commanded the army which had besieged Mount Sorrel, and which\r\nsoon afterwards defeated the Comte de Perche at Lincoln.\r\n\r\n_P._ 24, _ll._ 8, 9, 10, in the margin, opposite these three lines\r\nrespectively, the original scribe has written, “S. Notingham.\r\nTrente. Nicole.” The _nobilis matrona_ was Nichola, widow of Gerard\r\nde Camville, who defended Lincoln Castle against the French.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 11.--It may be well to point out the remarkable\r\nalliteration in this line and the following.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 14, _signa_.--The MS. has _singna_, a form not uncommon\r\nin such words.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 15, _ora_.--The MS. has _hora_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 25, _l._ 2, _Sabbatum_.--Saturday, May 20, 1217. The next day\r\nwas Trinity Sunday.\r\n\r\n_P._ 28, _l._ 11, _Sabinæ_.--Sabina was a very common term for a\r\nmodest woman in low Latin, just as Thais was for a strumpet. See\r\non the latter word a note in the _Early Mysteries and other Latin\r\nPoems_, p. 131.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 12, _Arabes_.--Arabia, the land of gems and spices, was\r\nbelieved to contain inexhaustible stores of riches.\r\n\r\n_P._ 33, _l._ 4, _Refert ad focariam_.--_Focaria_ was the name\r\ngiven to the wives or concubines of the priests and clergy, who\r\nhad been recently proscribed. It occurs again in the _Apocalypsis\r\nGoliæ_--\r\n\r\n      Seductam nuncii fraude præambuli,\r\n      Capit _focariam_, ut per cubiculi\r\n      Fortunam habeat fortunam loculi,\r\n      Et per vehiculum omen vehiculi.\r\n\r\nI have rendered the word, according to its derivation, by\r\n_fire-side woman_, for it is explained in an old gloss as\r\n_meretrix foco assidens_. See _Ducange in v._ Fuller (Church\r\nHist. p. 27, folio edit.) makes very needless difficulties on the\r\nmeaning of this word, apparently for the sake of introducing some\r\nequally needless jokes. The following article in the _decreta_\r\nof Pope Alexander, printed in the History of Henry of Huntingdon\r\n(Scriptores post Bedam, fol. 1601), p. 589, which one would think\r\nmust have passed under his eyes, left little room for doubt;--\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Ne clerici in sacris ordinibus constituti_ focarias _habeant._\r\n\r\n“Clerici in sacris ordinibus constituti, qui mulierculas in domibus\r\nsuis sub incontinentiæ nota tenuerint, aut abjiciant eas et\r\ncontinenter vivant, aut beneficio et officio fiant ecclesiastico\r\nalieni.”\r\n\r\nIn the statutes of Stephen, Archbishop of Canterbury, MS. Cotton.\r\nJulius D. II. fol. 167, r^o, we find also a chapter--\r\n\r\n\r\n“_De_ focariis _amovendis._\r\n\r\n“Sacerdotibus vero præcipue et spiritualiter in virtute Spiritus\r\nSancti et sub periculo beneficii districte præcipimus quod\r\ncontinenter vivant et honeste, concubinas suas a domibus suis\r\nprocul expellant, et nullam familiaritatem cum eis de cætero\r\nhabeant, nec in propriis domibus nec in alienis, nisi volunt simul\r\nbeneficiis et officiis contra hoc agendo privari,” etc.\r\n\r\nAnd again, just after, we have the following title:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“_De pœna et satisfactione_ focariarum.\r\n\r\n“Concubinæ sacerdotum frequenter moneantur ab archidiaconis,\r\net præcipue a sacerdotibus in quorum parochia morantur, vel ut\r\ncontrahant, vel ut claustrum ingrediantur, vel sicut publice\r\npeccaverunt publicam agant pœnetentiam.”\r\n\r\nThe word _focaria_ is often used by Giraldus Cambrensis. Speaking\r\nof a priest on the Borders of Wales, he says, “More sacerdotum\r\nparochialium Angliæ fere cunctorum damnabili quidem et detestabili,\r\npublicam secum habebat comitem individuam et _in foco focariam_ et\r\nin cubiculo concubinam.” (Wharton, Anglia Sacr. vol. ii. p. 525.)\r\nFrom this passage it is clear that the name _focaria_ was given to\r\nthem because they lived publicly with the priests in their houses,\r\nand _shared their fire-sides_; and from some other circumstances\r\nmentioned in Giraldus, it appears that they were in reality married\r\nto the priests, though the stricter party considered the marriage\r\nto be uncanonical.\r\n\r\n_P._ 36, _l._ 2, _Omina_.--The MS. has _Homina_.\r\n\r\n---- _Bernard de Rovenac_.--For all that is known of this poet, see\r\nthe _Histoire Littéraire de France_, tom. xviii. p. 667.\r\n\r\n_P._ 48, _ll._ 7-10, _Regnat nunc impietas_, &c. These four lines\r\nresemble very closely the first four lines of another song, in MS.\r\nSloane, No. 1580, fol. 160, v^o, which will be printed among the\r\nPoems of Walter Mapes--\r\n\r\n      Captivata largitas longe relegatur,\r\n      Exulansque probitas misere fugatur,\r\n      Dum virtuti veritas prave novercatur,\r\n      Inperat cupiditas atque principatur.\r\n\r\n_P._ 49, _l._ 8, _Wandelardus_.--Perhaps _a Vandal_.\r\n\r\n---- _ll._ 15-18. With the little information given in the song,\r\nit is difficult to ascertain who were the four brothers the writer\r\nintended to satirise. This punning way of deriving and explaining\r\nproper names was by no means uncommon during the middle ages. In\r\na splendid Bible in three volumes folio, written in England early\r\nin the twelfth century, and now preserved in the Library of St.\r\nGeneviève at Paris, the scribe gives the following very curious\r\naccount of his family. Its being previously inedited will be a\r\nsufficient excuse for inserting it here.\r\n\r\n“Hanc Bibliothecam scripsit Mainerus scriptor Cantuariensis. Sed\r\nne ab ignorantibus parentelam suam putaretur nothus, sive spurius,\r\nplacuit ei nomen proprium suum et nomen propinquorum parentum\r\nsuorum scribere et ethimo-logizare. Ipse itaque scriptor inter suos\r\nrecto nomine Mainerus nominabatur, quod nomen ei desienter datum\r\nest; Mainerus enim interpretatus est, imitata in sua manu gnatus,\r\nquia peritus fuit et gnarus in arte scribendi. Pater ejus Wimundus\r\nnominabatur, quod nomen interpretatum Latine sonat _hodie mundus_;\r\npoterat enim de eo dici cotidie quod mundus esset, quod mundus in\r\nmundo munde vixit, ad Creatorem suum sine immunditia migravit.\r\nNomen matris suæ dicebatur Anglice Livena, quod Latine sonat\r\n_lætitia_; fuit enim mulier hylaris, facie decora, moribus ornata\r\net pudica, et semper in largiendo bona sua pro Dei amore datrix\r\nhilaris; sana et incolumis per .lxxx. annos et plus feliciter\r\nvixit. Avus suus nominabatur Ulgerus, i. ulnas gerens; fuit enim\r\nvir magnus et fortis, qui magnas habebat ulnas. Nomen aviæ suæ\r\ndicebatur Anglice Elvera, quod interpretatur _Dei vidua_, quæ et in\r\nbona viduitate diu vixit. Quatuor habuit fratres et unam sororem,\r\nquorum primus vocabatur Radulphus, i. ratus et adustus, i. firmus\r\nin adolescentia; fortis enim valde juvenis fuit. Secundus dicebatur\r\nRobertus, quia a re nomen habuit, spoliator enim diu fuit et prædo.\r\nTertius nuncupabatur Giroldus, girovagus enim fuit omnibus diebus\r\nvitæ suæ. Quartus nominabatur Johannes, quod nomen interpretatum\r\nsonat _Dei gratia_; et iste gratiam Dei gratia Dei adeptus est;\r\nfuit enim juvenis ætate, senex moribus, virgo castitate, vita\r\nbeatus. Soror ipsius dicebatur Dionisia, id est Deo nitens;\r\nnitebatur enim semper bonis operibus ad Deum venire. Animæ omnium\r\nistorum et animæ omnium fidelium defunctorum per misericordiam Dei\r\nrequiescant in pace! Amen!”\r\n\r\n_P._ 51. SONG UPON THE TAILORS.--It is scarcely necessary to say\r\nthat the three lines which form the theme of this song, are the\r\ncommencement of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Llewellin, Prince of Wales,\r\ninvaded the Marches in 1263.\r\n\r\n_P._ 53, _l._ 3, _capucium_.--The name capuce was given sometimes\r\nto a separate piece of apparel with which the head was covered, and\r\nat others to the upper part of the tunic of the monks which covered\r\nthe head. In the present instance it must be taken in the former\r\nsense. A full account of the different senses of the word will be\r\nfound in Ducange.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 6, _almucium_.--The aumuce was a separate article of\r\nclothing which covered both head and shoulders. One of the articles\r\nof the canons for the behaviour of the monks, given by Pope Clement\r\nV., was, “ut almutiis de panno nigro, vel pellibus, caputiorum\r\nloco, uterentur.”\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 14, _Tyeis_.--The French and Anglo-Norman form of the\r\nLatin _Teutonicus_. It is the origin of the name of several old\r\nEnglish families.\r\n\r\n_P._ 57, _l._ 4, _Cernite_.--The MS. has _scernite_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 58, _l._ 2, _Frollo_.--This personage is a famous character in\r\nthe fabulous history of Arthur, and is there said to have been King\r\nof Paris under the Romans. When hard pressed by Arthur, who had\r\nconquered “all France and all Germany,” he took refuge in Paris,\r\nand was besieged there. The people in the city beginning to feel\r\nthe effects of famine, persuaded Frollo to engage Arthur in single\r\ncombat. The battle was said to have taken place in the “isle”\r\n(insula Parisiensis), the part of the French capital included\r\nbetween the two branches of the Seine, in which, at the present\r\nday, stand Nôtre-Dame and the Palais de Justice, with its beautiful\r\nSainte-Chapelle. The story of Arthur and Frollo is told at length\r\nin Geoffrey of Monmouth.\r\n\r\n---- _ll._ 10, 11, _Arthurus_.--King Arthur, the hero of so many\r\nromances. _Broinsius._ (?) _Constantinus._--Constantine the\r\nGreat, whose mother Helena was said to have been a British lady.\r\n_Brennius_: the conqueror of Rome, who, according to the British\r\nhistory, was a Briton.\r\n\r\n_P._ 58, _ll._ 13, 14, _Karolum_--Charlemagne; _Ricardum_--Richard\r\nCœur-de-Lion: both of whom were the heroes of romances and popular\r\nsongs. The same two heroes of French and English fable are\r\nmentioned in a curious passage of the Polychronica of Ralph Higden:\r\n“Quemadmodum Græci suum Alexandrum, Romani suum Octavium, Angli\r\nsuum Ricardum, Franci suum Karolum, sic Britones suum Arthurum\r\npræconiantur.” P. 225, in Gale’s Scriptores.\r\n\r\n_P._ 59. THE SONG OF THE BARONS.--The transcript of this curious\r\nfragment was communicated to me by Sir Frederick Madden. The\r\noriginal is written in a contemporary hand on a roll twenty-two\r\ninches long, by three broad, and was evidently intended to be\r\ncarried about by the minstrel who was to sing it. On the reverse\r\nhad been written a curious interlocutory poem in English of a later\r\nperiod, entitled, “Interludium de Clerico et Puella.” It was, in\r\n1838, in the possession of the Rev. Dr. Richard Yerburgh, Vicar of\r\nSleaford, in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nSuch rolls appear to have been in common use. A very curious vellum\r\nroll of the fifteenth century, containing chiefly religious songs\r\nwith the music, and, among the rest, a copy of the well-known song\r\non the battle of Agincourt printed by Percy, has been recently\r\ndeposited in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. I am\r\ninformed that another, of the thirteenth century, has been lately\r\nfound among the archives of Sir John Hanmer, Bart., containing\r\nan Anglo-Norman romance previously unknown, on the adventures of\r\nMelors, son of Melians of Cornwall. Among the Sloane MSS. in the\r\nBritish Museum (No. 809), is an early copy of the curious poem of\r\nWalter de Biblesworth, designed for the instruction of children\r\nin the French language, written in a similar manner on a roll of\r\nparchment, evidently for the purpose of being more easily used in\r\na school.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 1, _de Warenne ly bon quens ... en Norfolk_.--John, Earl\r\nof Warenne, a staunch supporter of the royal party, in whose cause\r\nwe shall soon afterwards find him fighting at Lewes.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _Sire Jon Giffard_.--Sir John Giffard, of Brimsfield,\r\nin Gloucestershire, a firm adherent of the Barons. When Sir\r\nRoger de Clifford delivered Gloucester to Prince Edward, Giffard\r\nfortified his castle of Brimsfield, and greatly annoyed the\r\nroyalist garrison of the former place. For an account of his\r\nexploits at this time, see Robert of Gloucester’s Chronicle, pp.\r\n538, 539. He was on the Barons’ party at the battle of Lewes, and\r\nwas taken prisoner there; but afterwards, when Simon de Montfort\r\nwas in the height of his power, Giffard deserted him. See Robert of\r\nGloucester, p. 550.\r\n\r\n_P._ 60, _l._ 1, _Sire Jon Dayvile_.--Sir John Dayvile, or D’Ayvile\r\n(Robert of Gloucester calls him in one place De Eivile) does not\r\nappear very prominent in these troubles till after the death\r\nof Simon de Montfort at Evesham. He then headed those of the\r\nBarons who established themselves at Chesterford in the Peak, and\r\nafterwards was the chief of those who held the Isle of Ely against\r\nthe King. Knighton calls him “homo callidus et bellator fortis.”\r\nSee Knighton (in Twysden), col. 2454; Chron. Thomæ Wikes (Gale),\r\npp. 81, 82; Robert of Gloucester, p. 564.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _De Cliffort ly bon Roger_.--Roger de Clifford first\r\ntook part with the Barons, but early in the war deserted them, and\r\ndelivered Gloucester castle, which he held for them, to Prince\r\nEdward. He was with the King at Northampton.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 13, _Sire Roger de Leyburne ... ses pertes que Sire\r\nEdward le fist_.--Sir Roger de Leyburn was at first a partizan\r\nof the Barons, and had been taken prisoner at Rochester Castle,\r\nand committed to the custody of John Mareschall. It was on this\r\noccasion, probably, that he was visited with the penalties alluded\r\nto in the song. He was afterwards seduced by the royal party, and\r\nmade Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was with the King at the taking\r\nof Northampton, at the defence of Rochester, where he was wounded,\r\nand at Lewes.\r\n\r\n_P._ 61, _l._ 16, _Ly eveske de Herefort_.--Peter de Egueblanche,\r\nBishop of Hereford, a staunch adherent to the King, and, by his\r\noppressions, exceedingly obnoxious to the Commons. In 1263, the\r\nBarons seized and imprisoned him, and confiscated his treasures. He\r\nwas a native of Savoy.\r\n\r\n_P._ 62, _l._ 1, _ly pastors de Norwis_.--Simon de Wanton, Bishop\r\nof Norwich, from 1257 to 1265, chaplain to King Henry III., and one\r\nof his justices.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _Sire Jon de Langelé_.--According to the Annales de\r\nDunstaple, the estates of _G._ de Langley were plundered soon after\r\nthe arrest of the Bishop of Hereford:--“idem facientes de maneriis\r\nG. de Langele et ejus bonis.” Vol. i. p. 354. Perhaps this was the\r\nsame person.\r\n\r\n_P._ 62, _l._ 13, _Sire Mathi de Besile_.--We should perhaps read\r\n_Machi_; Robert of Gloucester and Stow call him _Macy_. He was a\r\nFrench knight, who had been made Sheriff of Gloucester, after the\r\nKing had sworn to the articles of Oxford. The Barons ejected him,\r\nand put another sheriff in his place; Sir Macy came with a body\r\nof armed men and the authority of the King, reinstated himself by\r\nforce, and drove away his rival. Sir Roger de Clifford and Sir John\r\nGiffard came against him, besieged and took Gloucester Castle, and\r\nimprisoned him along with the “Freinss bissop” of Hereford, whom\r\nthey seized immediately afterwards. Robert of Gloucester mentions\r\nthe confiscation of his property:--\r\n\r\n      “And Sir Jon Giffard nom to him is quic eiȝte echon,\r\n      And al that he fond of is, and nameliche at Sserton.”\r\n\r\nThe song here printed was evidently written just after this event,\r\nand previous to the subsequent desertion of Clifford and others\r\nmentioned in it.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 18, _treget_.--It has been suggested that this word\r\nrepresents the Latin _treugellum_, a little truce.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 19, _mi Sire Jon de Gray_.--John de Gray held on the\r\nKing’s party, and was rewarded for his loyalty by the grant of\r\nvarious high offices. The circumstance alluded to in the song is\r\nthus told in the Annales de Dunstaple (Ed. Hearne, vol. i. p. 357);\r\nit occurred in the disturbances in London in 1263.--“Quo perpetrato\r\nfacinore, cives Londoniarum contra ipsum et alios de consilio regis\r\nin civitate commorantes, insurrexerunt; in tantum quod hospitium\r\nJohannis de Grey extra Ludgate invaserunt, et equos ejus triginta\r\nduo et alia quæcunque ibidem inventa abduxerunt: ipso Johanne cum\r\ndifficultate maxima ultra alveum de Flete fugam arripiente. Idem\r\nfecerunt de domibus et bonis Simonis Passelewe.”\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 21, _que must_, quod movit.\r\n\r\n_P._ 63, _l._ 4, _Sire Willem le Latimer_.--Sir William le Latimer\r\nwas a firm adherent of the King, and held at different times\r\nseveral offices of trust. He suffered considerable losses in the\r\nBarons’ wars. He afterwards appears to have accompanied Prince\r\nEdward to the Holy Land, and was at the siege of Carlaverock in\r\n1300. He died in 1305, at a very advanced age. Knighton calls him\r\n_miles strenuissimus_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 63. SONG OF THE PEACE WITH ENGLAND.--It has been suggested\r\nto me that the word _cul_ in this song is only a form of _col_\r\n(collum); and I am told that among the titles of some fables in\r\nthe same manuscript there is one of the stork “au long _cul_.” In\r\nthis song, however, I am inclined to think such an interpretation\r\nnot admissible. It is a rude burlesque not only upon the event to\r\nwhich it relates, but upon the English in general, and contains\r\nmuch coarse humour such as is not uncommonly used at the present\r\nday. The grammatical construction is, evidently by design, a\r\ncomplete confusion of tenses, numbers, and genders. It appears to\r\nme that not a little of the effect it was intended to produce,\r\ndepended upon the coarse play upon words involved in the use of\r\nthe expression above mentioned. When the reciter introduced King\r\nHenry to his auditors, and they expected he was going to sigh from\r\nhis heart, instead of completing the sentence _il suspire de cœur_\r\n(p. 65), _i. e._ ille suspirat de corde, he introduces another\r\nword beginning with the same letter, and says _il suspire de cul_\r\n(ille suspirat de culo). That _Trichart_ in the preceding line\r\nwas intended for a pun upon _Richard_, we may conjecture from the\r\nrhymes in the English song on the same person’s name, p. 69. Again,\r\nat p. 66, it would naturally be expected that he would place his\r\nlance against his enemy’s _cœur_; the blow was to be so strong,\r\nthat if his opponent did not give way, he would himself suffer in\r\nthat part which was in communication with the saddle, and where, of\r\ncourse, the resistance was concentrated. These jokes must have been\r\nextremely diverting to the class of people for whom this song was\r\ndesigned.\r\n\r\nThe Song of the Peace with England had been previously printed by\r\nMons. Achille Jubinal, well known for his numerous publications\r\nof early French literature, in a very curious volume entitled\r\n“Jongleurs et Trouvères,” 8vo. Paris, 1835. M. Jubinal also gave\r\na translation into modern French of this song, as well as of the\r\npiece I am now going to mention, in the “Journal de l’Institut\r\nHistorique,” Jan. 1835, which has been reproduced in the Histoire\r\nde Saint Louis, by the Marquis de Villeneuve-Trans, 8vo. Paris,\r\n1839, vol. iii. p. 614. In the manuscript from which this song is\r\nprinted, it is accompanied by a piece in prose on the same event,\r\nand of a similar character, entitled _Le Chartre de la Pais aus\r\nAnglois_, which I venture to reprint here from M. Jubinal’s book,\r\nas the latter is now out of print, and very scarce. It will be\r\nobserved that the same style of gross joking which is found in the\r\nsong, runs through the charter; a double meaning was evidently\r\nintended, for example, in the words _qu’il fu fet .i. gros pes\r\nentre, etc._, which might be taken as signifying, in this broken\r\nFrench, either _grossa pax_, or _grossus peditus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_La Chartre de la Pais aus Anglois._\r\n\r\n“Ce sache sil qui sont et qui ne sont mi, et qui ne doivent mi\r\nestre, qu’il fu fet .i. gros pes entre ce rai Hari d’Ingleter, et\r\nce riche homme Loys à Parris, sarra forretier de ce grant forrest\r\nà Normandi.

Why his name is introduced so prominently, does not\r\nseem clear. He died in the year following (1264), and the title\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\n_P._ 67, _l._ 3, _Rogier Bigot_.--Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n_P._ 67, _l._ 18, _Saint Amont_, means, probably, St. Edmund.\r\n\r\n_P._ 69. SONG AGAINST THE KING OF ALMAIGNE.--This song was first\r\nprinted in Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 2, _Kyn of Alemaigne_.--It is hardly necessary to say\r\nthat this was Richard Earl of Cornwall, the King’s brother.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 3, _Thritti thousent pound_.--The Barons had offered him\r\nthis sum, if he would by his intermediation persuade the King to\r\nagree to a peace with them, and at the same time accept the terms\r\nthey demanded.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _Walingford_.--The honour of Wallingford had been\r\nconferred on Richard in 1243.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 12.--Windsor was the stronghold of the royal party, and\r\nhad been garrisoned by foreigners.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 15, _mulne_.--“After the battle was lost, Richard, King\r\nof the Romans, took refuge in a windmill, which he barricadoed, and\r\nmaintained for some time against the Barons, but in the evening\r\nwas obliged to surrender. See a very full account of this in the\r\nChronicle of Mailros.” _Percy._\r\n\r\n_P._ 70, _l._ 8.--The Earl of Warenne escaped from the battle, and\r\nfled into France.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 20, _Sire Hue de Bigot_.--Hugh Bigod escaped with the\r\nEarl of Warenne to Pevensey, and from thence to France. He was\r\ncousin to the Hugh Bigod who took part with the Barons, and was\r\nslain at Lewes.\r\n\r\n_P._ 71, _l._ 6, _lyard_.--This word (in low Latin _liardus_)\r\nmeans, properly, a dapple-grey horse; but it is often used, like\r\nseveral other similar words, as a common name for a horse in\r\ngeneral. I have interpreted it as meaning a hack; but probably the\r\npassage implies a sneer at Edward, who had been more than once\r\nwith his army to Dover, in the hope of taking the castle from the\r\nBarons, and the word may mean simply his horse.\r\n\r\n_P._ 72, _l._ 13.--The battle of Lewes was fought on Thursday, (?)\r\nMay 14, 1264.\r\n\r\n_P._ 73, _l._ 36, _in claustro_.--A great part of those of the\r\nKing’s party who quitted the field, took shelter in the abbey of\r\nLewes, where they were besieged by the Barons.\r\n\r\n_P._ 74, _l._ 47, _apud Northamptoniam_.--Northampton had been\r\ntaken by the King on the third of April preceding.\r\n\r\n_P._ 74, _l._ 55, _monasterium, quod Bellum vocatur_.--I have not\r\nfound any notice elsewhere of the contributions forced from the\r\nabbies of Battle and Robertsbridge.\r\n\r\n_P._ 75, _l._ 1, _monachi Cystercii de Ponte-Roberti_.--There was\r\nan abbey of Cistertian monks at Robertsbridge, in Sussex.\r\n\r\n---- _ll._ 73-77.--With these lines may be compared a passage in\r\nKnighton’s Chronicle (ap. Twysden), col. 2445:--“Et sicut Simon\r\nMachabæus surrexit pro fratre suo Juda, ut pro populo Dei et lege\r\npaterna certaret ad mortem; sic et Simon de Monteforti pro Anglia\r\nerexit se, ut pro legibus et libertatibus ejus usque ad mortis\r\nperniciem dimicaret.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 76, _l._ 94, _intumuit_.--In the MS. the scribe has written\r\n_intimuit_ in the margin, either as a various reading, or as an\r\nimprovement of his own.\r\n\r\n_P._ 78, _l._ 128, _bellici_.--The MS. has _vellici_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 79, _l._ 145, _gaudii_.--The MS. has _gladii_ in the text,\r\nwith _gaudii_ written in the margin.\r\n\r\n_P._ 81, _l._ 193, _S. divina gratia præsul Cycestrensis_.--Stephen\r\nde Berkstead, Bishop of Chichester. He was excommunicated for his\r\nstaunch adherence to the party of Simon de Montfort.\r\n\r\n_P._ 88, _l._ 325, _movisset_.--The MS. has _novisset_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 330, _for_ proponerat, _read_ proponeret.\r\n\r\n_P._ 89, _l._ 252, _invenire_.--The MS. has _inveniere_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 94, _l._ 437, _Testis sit Glovernia_.--Alluding to the\r\ndelivery of Gloucester to Prince Edward, and his treatment of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n_P._ 102, _l._ 609, _regis et_.--The MS. has _regisset_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 104, _l._ 635, _Unius rex, etc._--This line appears to be very\r\ncorrupt, as are one or two others in the poem.\r\n\r\n_P._ 114, _l._ 833, _Nec libertas proprie debet nominari, | quæ\r\npermittit inscie stultos dominari_.--The reader will hardly fail to\r\ncall to mind the similar sentiment expressed in the line of Milton--\r\n\r\n      “Licence they mean, when they cry liberty.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 115, _l._ 858, _p’rat_.--The MS. has pr̄at, the meaning of\r\nwhich is by no means clear.\r\n\r\n_P._ 116, _l._ 875, _Veritas, lux, caritas, calor, urit\r\nzelus_.--Perhaps the commas should be omitted after _veritas_ and\r\n_caritas_, and the whole be translated, “Truth is light, charity is\r\nwarmth, zeal burns.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 117, _Regis esse noveris nomen relativum_.--It would be by\r\nno means uninteresting to collect the expressions of the popular\r\ndoctrine concerning the kingly character held by our forefathers\r\nat different periods. Perhaps it may not be considered altogether\r\nforeign to the subject to point out here a few of them.\r\n\r\nI.--In a MS. of the tenth century (MS. Cotton. Nero, A. I., fol.\r\n71, r^o.) we have, among some other things of a similar kind,\r\nthe following sketch of the opinion of the Anglo-Saxons on this\r\nsubject, said to be from the pen of Alfric:--\r\n\r\nCristenum cyninge ge-byreð on cristenre þeode, þæt he sy eal swa\r\nhit riht is folces frofer, ⁊ rihtwis hyrde ofer cristene heorde,\r\n⁊ hym ge-byreð þæt he eallum mægene cristendom rære, ⁊ Godes\r\ncyrcan æghwar georne fyrðrie ⁊ friðrie, ⁊ eal cristen folc sibbie\r\n⁊ sehte mid rihtre lage, swa he geornost mæge, ⁊ þurh ælc þing\r\nriht-wisnesse lufie, for Gode ⁊ for worolde. For þam þurh þæt he\r\nsceal sylf fyrmest ge-þeon, ⁊ his þeodscype eac swa, þe he riht\r\nlufige, for Gode ⁊ for worolde. ⁊ him ge-byreð þæt he geornlice\r\nfylste þam þe riht willan, ⁊ á hetelicest yre þam þe þryres wyllan.\r\n\r\nHe sceal mán dæde men þreagean þearle, mid woroldlicre steore; ⁊\r\nhe sceal ryperas ⁊ reaferas ⁊ worold-struderas hatian ⁊ hynan;\r\n⁊ eallum Godes feondum styrnlice wiðstandan; ⁊ ægðer he sceal\r\nbeon mid rihte ge milde ge reðe, milde þam godum, ⁊ styrne þam\r\nyfelum. Ðæt bið cyninges riht, ⁊ cynelic ge-wuna, ⁊ þæt sceal on\r\nþeode swyþost ge-fremian. La! þurh hwæt sceal Godes þeowum ⁊ Godes\r\nþearfum frið ⁊ fultum cuman, butan þurh Crist ⁊ þurh cristenne\r\ncyning? Ðurh cyninges wisdom folc wyrð ge-sælig, ge-sundful, ⁊\r\nsigefæst, ⁊ þy sceal wis cyning Cristendom ⁊ cynedom miclian ⁊\r\nmærsian, ⁊ á he sceal hæþendom hindrian ⁊ hyrwan.\r\n\r\nHe sceal boc-larum hlystan swyþe georne, ⁊ Godes beboda geornlice\r\nhealdan, ⁊ ge-lome wið witan wisdom smeagan, gyf he gode wile\r\nrihtlice hyran. ⁊ gif hwa to þam stræt sy ahwar on þeode, þæt riht\r\nnelle healdan swa swa he scolde, ac Godes lage wyrde, oððe folc\r\nlage myrre, þonne cyþe hit man þam cynge, gif man þæt nyde scyle,\r\n⁊ he þonne sona ræde ymbe þa bote ⁊ ge-wylde hine georne, to þam\r\nþe his þearf sy huru unþances, gif he elles ne mæge. ⁊ do swa him\r\nþearf is, clænsige his þeode, for Gode ⁊ for worolde, gif he Godes\r\nmiltse ge-earnian wylle.\r\n\r\n      It behoves a Christian King in a Christian people, that he\r\n      be all as it is right the people’s protector, and a just\r\n      shepherd over the Christian flock, and it behoves him that he\r\n      with all his might raise Christendom, and advance and protect\r\n      God’s church everywhere diligently, and pacify and reconcile\r\n      with just law all Christian people, as he most earnestly\r\n      may, and love justice in every thing, before God and before\r\n      the world. Because by that he shall profit himself in the\r\n      first place, and also his people, whom let him love rightly,\r\n      before God and before the world. And it behoveth him that he\r\n      diligently help those who wish for justice, and ever most\r\n      hatefully persecute those who wish for wrong. He shall punish\r\n      men severely for evil deeds, with secular punishment; and he\r\n      shall hate and put down thieves and robbers and oppressors of\r\n      the world; and sternly resist all God’s enemies; and he shall\r\n      be with justice both mild and severe, mild to the good and\r\n      stern to the bad. This is the king’s right, and the manner of\r\n      a king, and this shall be most efficient in the people. Lo!\r\n      through what shall peace and help come to God’s servants and\r\n      to God’s poor, except through Christ and through a Christian\r\n      king? Through the king’s wisdom the people shall be happy,\r\n      prosperous, and victorious, and on that account shall a\r\n      wise king enlarge and increase Christianity and royalty,\r\n      and ever he shall hinder and persecute heathendom. He shall\r\n      listen very diligently to scholars, and diligently hold God’s\r\n      commandments, and frequently search wisdom from his witans,\r\n      if he will rightly hear what is good. And if any one openly\r\n      be any where in the people, that will not hold justice as\r\n      he should, but infringes God’s law, or obstructs the law of\r\n      the people, then let people declare it to the king, if they\r\n      would extinguish that violence, and there let them soon take\r\n      counsel for the amends, and subdue him diligently, until that\r\n      he be reduced at last by force, if he may not otherwise.\r\n      And let him do as it is needful for him, purify his people,\r\n      before God and before the world, if he will earn God’s mercy.\r\n\r\nAnd again, a little further on (fol. 72, r^o.)--\r\n\r\n  Ælc riht cynestol stent on þrim stapelum, þe fullice ariht\r\n  stænt. An is _Oratores_, ⁊ oðer is _Laboratores_, ⁊ þridde\r\n  is _Bellatores_. _Oratores_ syndon gebedmen, þe Gode scylan\r\n  þeowian, ⁊ dæges ⁊ nihtes for ealne þeodscype þingigan georne.\r\n  _Laboratores_ syndon weorc-men, þe tilian scylan þæs þe eal\r\n  þeodscype big sceal libban. _Bellatores_ syndon wig-men, þe eard\r\n  scylon werian, wiglice mid wæpnum.

Ac do man swa hit þearf is, alecge man un-riht, ⁊ rære\r\n  up Godes riht, þæt mæg to þearfe for Gode ⁊ for worolde. _Amen._\r\n\r\n      Every just throne stands on three props, that stands\r\n      perfectly right. One is _Oratores_, and the other is\r\n      _Laboratores_, and the third is _Bellatores_. The _Oratores_\r\n      are the men of prayer, who shall serve God, and by day and\r\n      night intercede for the whole nation. The _Laboratores_ are\r\n      the workmen, who shall labour in order that all the nation\r\n      shall live thereby. The _Bellatores_ are the men of war (_i.\r\n      e._ knights), who shall defend the land, valiantly with\r\n      weapons. On these three props shall every throne stand with\r\n      justice among Christian people. And if any of them become\r\n      weakened, soon the throne wavers; and if any one of them\r\n      fail entirely, then the throne falls down, and that will\r\n      be the entire ruin of the people. But let man establish\r\n      and strengthen and confirm them diligently, with the wise\r\n      law of God and just law of the world, that will be to the\r\n      nation for a lasting counsel. And it is true what I say, if\r\n      Christendom be weakened, soon royalty wavers; and if people\r\n      raise lawlessness everywhere in the land, or love everywhere\r\n      wickedness too much, that brings the people entirely to ruin.\r\n      But let people do as it is needful, let people put down\r\n      injustice, and raise up God’s justice, that may bring it to\r\n      prosperity before God and before the world. _Amen._\r\n\r\nII. In the curious poem of the proverbs of Alfred, composed perhaps\r\nin the twelfth century, and which is here quoted from a MS. of the\r\nearlier part of the thirteenth century (MS. Trin. Coll. Cambridge,\r\nB. 14, 39) is the following account of the duties of King and\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\n    ¶ þus quad Alfred,\r\n      Englene frovere:\r\n      May no riche king\r\n      ben onder Crist selves,\r\n      bote þif he be booc-lerid,\r\n      ⁊ he writes wel kenne,\r\n      ⁊ bote he cunne letteris,\r\n      lokin himselven\r\n      wu he sule his lond\r\n      laweliche holden.\r\n\r\n    ¶ þus quad Helfred:\r\n      þe herl ⁊ þe heþeling\r\n      þo ben under þe King,\r\n      þe lond to leden\r\n      mid lauelich i-dedin,\r\n      boþe þe clerc ⁊ þe cnit\r\n      demen evenliche rict.\r\n      For after þat mon souit,\r\n      als inpich sal he mouin,\r\n      ⁊ everiches monnes dom\r\n      to his oge dure cherricd.\r\n\r\n    ¶ þus quad Alfred:\r\n      þe cnith biovit\r\n      kerliche to cnouen\r\n      for to weriin þe lond\r\n      of here ⁊ of here-gong,\r\n      þat þe riche habbe gryt,\r\n      ⁊ þe cherril be in frit,\r\n      his sedis to souin,\r\n      his medis to mowen,\r\n      his plouis to drivin,\r\n      to ure alre bi-lif.\r\n      þis is þe cnichs lage,\r\n      loke þat hit wel fare.\r\n\r\n      Thus saith Alfred,\r\n      the protector of the English:\r\n      There may no just king\r\n      be under Christ himself,\r\n      unless he be book-learned,\r\n      and he know well writings,\r\n      and unless he know letters,\r\n      to look himself\r\n      how he shall his land\r\n      hold with good laws.\r\n\r\n      Thus saith Alfred:\r\n      The Earl and the Atheling\r\n      they are under the King,\r\n      the land to lead\r\n      by example of lawful deeds,\r\n      both the clerk and the knight\r\n      to judge impartially right.\r\n      For according as a man sows,\r\n      so shall he mow,\r\n      and every man’s judgment\r\n      falls at his own door.\r\n\r\n      Thus saith Alfred:\r\n      It behoves the knight\r\n      carefully to know\r\n      how to defend the land\r\n      from army and from invasion,\r\n      that the rich may have peace,\r\n      and the churl be in tranquillity,\r\n      his seeds to sow,\r\n      his meadows to mow,\r\n      to drive his ploughs,\r\n      for the sustenance of us all.\r\n      This is the knights’ law,\r\n      see that it goes well.\r\n\r\nIII. In the middle of the thirteenth century, at the period of the\r\nBarons’ wars, we have the passage to which this forms a note.\r\n\r\nIV. In the reign of Edward III. the writer of Piers Ploughman\r\ngives us the following description of the relative duties of the\r\ndifferent orders of society.\r\n\r\n      Thanne kam ther a kyng,\r\n      knyȝthod hym ladde,\r\n      miȝt of the communes\r\n      made hym to regne.\r\n      And thanne cam kynde wit,\r\n      and clerkes he made,\r\n      for to counseillen the kyng,\r\n      and the commune save.\r\n      The kyng and knyȝthod,\r\n      and clergie bothe,\r\n      casten that the commune\r\n      sholde hemself fynde.\r\n      The commune contreved\r\n      of kynde wit craftes,\r\n      and for profit of al the peple\r\n      plowmen ordeyned,\r\n      to tilie and to travaille,\r\n      as trewe lif asketh.\r\n      The kyng and the commune,\r\n      and kynde wit the thridde,\r\n      shopen lawe and leauté,\r\n      ech man to knowe his owene.\r\n\r\n      Then came there a king,\r\n      knighthood led him,\r\n      the power of the commons\r\n      made him to reign.\r\n      And then came natural sense,\r\n      and he made clerks,\r\n      in order to counsel the king,\r\n      and to be a safeguard to the commons,\r\n      The king and knighthood,\r\n      and clergy along with them,\r\n      determined that the commons\r\n      should find themselves.\r\n      The commons contrived\r\n      arts by means of natural sense,\r\n      and for the profit of the people\r\n      ordained ploughmen,\r\n      to till and to labour,\r\n      as true life requires.\r\n      The king and the commons,\r\n      and natural sense the third,\r\n      created law and loyalty,\r\n      each man to know his own.\r\n\r\nV. We may compare all these with the Alliterative Poem on the\r\nDeposition of Richard the Second, p. 23, to which, as it is one\r\nof the Publications of the Camden Society, I need do no more than\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\n_P._ 120, _l._ 947.--This line cannot be construed as it stands,\r\nand is evidently corrupt.\r\n\r\n_P._ 121. _William de Rishanger_ was a monk of St. Alban’s, and\r\nis said to have been the King’s historiographer (historiographus\r\nregius) after Matthew Paris’s death. He died in 1312. He tells\r\nus that this song was written before, and not after, the battle\r\nof Lewes; and that it was the defection of some of the Barons\r\nmentioned in the song at p. 59, which gave rise to it. It is,\r\ntherefore, probably placed wrongly after the battle of Lewes.\r\n\r\n_P._ 122, _l._ 19, _O Comes Gloverniæ_.--This was Gilbert de\r\nClare, who was extremely active in the cause of the Barons, and\r\ndistinguished himself at the battle of Lewes.\r\n\r\n_P._ 123, _l._ 3.--The second line of this tetrastich seems to be\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _Comes le Bygot_.--This was Roger Bigod, Earl of\r\nNorfolk, whom the Barons made Governor of Orford in Suffolk, after\r\nthe battle of Lewes.\r\n\r\n_P._ 124, _l._ 3, _nobis_.--A mere error of the press for _vobis_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 125. THE LAMENT OF SIMON DE MONTFORT.--This song was printed\r\nprivately, with some other Anglo-Norman poems from the same MS.,\r\nby Sir Francis Palgrave, in 1818, in a collection which is now\r\nextremely rare. It was also inserted in the second edition of\r\nRitson’s Ancient Songs (1829), where it is accompanied with a\r\ntranslation in English verse by George Ellis.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 8, _Tot à cheval_.--The Barons were surprised at Evesham\r\nbefore they were joined by their foot soldiers, and when therefore\r\nthey were unprepared for this decisive conflict.\r\n\r\n_P._ 126, _l._ 4, _Sire Hue le fer, ly Despencer, tresnoble\r\njustice_.--Hugh Despencer, appointed justiciary of England by the\r\nBarons. He fell at Evesham.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 6, _Sire Henri ... fitz le cuens de Leycestre_.--The\r\neldest son of Simon de Montfort; he fell in the battle.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _par le cuens de Gloucestre_.--After the battle\r\nof Lewes, the Earl of Gloucester, becoming jealous of Simon de\r\nMontfort’s popularity, deserted to the King, and fought against his\r\nformer associates at Evesham.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 14, _une heyre_.--I suppose this refers to Guy de\r\nMontfort, Simon’s second son, who was taken prisoner at Evesham,\r\nbut afterwards escaped and fled to the Continent.\r\n\r\n_P._ 126, _l._ 15, _les faus ribaus_.--As this word, _ribaldus_,\r\n_ribaus_, _ribaud_, occurs frequently in our Songs, both in Latin,\r\nAnglo-Norman, and English, it may be worth while to say something\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those curious words of which the origin and primary\r\nsignification are very doubtful. It was certainly applied to a\r\nparticular class of people, and a class which seems to have been\r\ndependant on the household of the great. Giraldus Cambrensis, when\r\ntelling his various troubles and persecutions (Wharton, Anglia\r\nSacra, vol. iii. p. 575), speaks thus of the witnesses brought\r\nagainst him by his enemies:--“Archidiaconus (_i. e._ Giraldus\r\nhimself) autem statim, productis testibus illis coram auditoribus\r\nad jurandum, proposuit in singulorum personas se dicturum; in\r\ncanonicos Menevenses tanquam perjuros et excommunicatos, in\r\nmonachos tanquam trutannos et domorum suarum desertores, in\r\n_ribaldos_ tanquam vilissimos et, sicut cæteri cuncti, mercede\r\nconductos.” And again, on the next page, “Et testium multitudinem\r\nde garcionibus et _ribaldis_ partis adversæ, qui omnes jurare\r\nparati fuerant et testificare ... trutannus ille vilissimus id\r\ntotum faciebat; qui et _ribaldos suos_ cunctos ad hoc probandum\r\nsimul cum ipso mittebat.... Videns igitur archidiaconus _ribaldos\r\nillos_ ad nutum _dominorum suorum_ quidlibet probare paratos....\r\nSciens itaque si _probatio ribaldica_ procederet ... _ribaldica\r\nmultitudo_, etc.” They seem to have been the lowest class of\r\nretainers, perhaps men without any certain appointment, who had\r\nno other mode of living than following the courts of the Barons,\r\nand who were employed on all kinds of disgraceful and wicked\r\nactions. One authority quoted by Ducange couples “parasitos\r\natque _ribaldos_.” A story quoted from a MS. at Berne, by Sinner\r\n(Catalogus, tom. i. p. 272), shows us that a _goliard_ belonged to\r\nthe class of _ribalds_: now a _goliard_ seems to have been only\r\nanother name for a _jongleur_ (joculator), or one who attended the\r\ntables of the rich to amuse the guests by jokes, buffoonery, and\r\nmountebank tricks. An ecclesiastical statute quoted in Ducange\r\n(v. Goliardus) says, “item præcipimus quod clerici non sint\r\n_joculatores_, _goliardi_, seu _bufones_;” and another commands,\r\n“quod clerici _ribaldi_, maxime vero qui dicuntur _de familia\r\ngoliæ_, per episcopos ... tondere præcipiantur.” Matthew Paris,\r\nsub an. 1229, says, “quidam famuli, vel mancipia, vel illi quos\r\nsolemus _goliardenses_ appellare, versus ridiculos componebant.”\r\nIn this last passage we find them classed with the famuli, or\r\nhousehold retainers. This class appears, at least in France, to\r\nhave enjoyed certain popular rights or privileges. In a very\r\ncurious charter of the year 1380, printed in Ducange, we find one\r\nAntony de Sagiac “se _gerens pro ribaldo_, et se dicens de ordine\r\nseu de statu goliardorum, seu buffonum,” claiming a fine of five\r\npence upon incontinent women, and accused of trying to extract\r\nmoney from a woman, whom he accused wrongfully, on this account,\r\n“de talique et alio vili questu, quem sub umbra _ribaldiæ_,\r\n_goliardiæ_, seu _buffoniæ_ ejusmodi ... vivebat.” In the household\r\nof the King of France there was a _rex ribaldorum_, whose office\r\nwas to judge disputes, &c. which might occur among the retainers of\r\nhis class, and who had also a jurisdiction over the public stews.\r\nAs the lives of this class of men were set at a small value by\r\ntheir masters, they were commonly exposed to the first brunt of\r\nbattle in the wars, and the name is sometimes given to the body\r\nwhich is now called the _forlorn hope_ in the attack of a town. The\r\n_ribaldi_ who accompanied the army were also employed in plundering\r\nand destroying the country. As they were people of vile life and\r\ncondition, the term _ribald_ came gradually into use as a common\r\nappellation for a low and infamous person, and was used, as in the\r\npresent instance, as an epithet of contempt and degradation.\r\n\r\n_P._ 128, _l._ 1, _pepulere_.--The MS. has _pepulare_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 130, _l._ 8, _Plebs devicta fremit_.--Alluding to the rising\r\nat Chesterfield, the occupation of the Isles of Axholme and Ely,\r\nand other insurrections.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 11, _Urbs Londoniensis_.--The Earl of Gloucester,\r\ndissatisfied with the King’s proceedings after the battle of\r\nEvesham, had taken up arms and established himself at London, the\r\ncitizens of which joined his party readily, as they were themselves\r\nenraged against the King for having deprived them of their charter.\r\n\r\n_P._ 131, _l._ 2, _Francorum regis germanus rex Siculorum_.--Prince\r\nEdward left England in July, 1270, to join the King of France,\r\nSaint Louis, in his expedition to the Holy Land. Louis was\r\npersuaded by his brother, Charles, then King of Sicily, to turn\r\naside, in order to make war on the Bey of Tunis, from whom he\r\nclaimed a tribute. Louis died at Carthage of a disease produced by\r\nthe climate; and when Prince Edward and his English army arrived,\r\nthey found their ally dead, and the King of Sicily, who had made\r\nadvantageous terms with the Bey, ready to return home. Charles, who\r\nhastened to take possession of the throne of France, refused to\r\nproceed in the crusade, and Edward, who was obliged to go alone,\r\nwent over to Sicily, and wintered at Trapani. Here, on the night\r\nof December 23, the day after their arrival, occurred the terrible\r\nstorm alluded to in the Poem. Early in the spring, Edward, with his\r\nsmall army, proceeded on their voyage, and landed at Acre.\r\n\r\n_P._ 132, _l._ 5, _Accon respirat_.--Acre was besieged by Bondocar,\r\nSultan of Babylon, who was preparing to take the place by assault,\r\nat the moment when Edward arrived to raise the siege.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 9, _Assessinus Veteris de Monte_.--On the Old Man of the\r\nMountain, and the Assassins, or Assessins, much information will\r\nbe found in a popular form, in the Marquis of Villeneuve-Trans,\r\nHistoire de St. Louis.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 16.--This seems to be a new testimony against the truth\r\nof the story which makes Edward’s Queen suck the poison from his\r\nwound. A song made on the occasion would hardly have failed to\r\nmention such a circumstance, if it had been known.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 17, _Thomam de Wyta_.--This writer’s name is not found in\r\nTanner.\r\n\r\n_P._ 135, _l._ 13, _comencent_.--Probably an error of the scribe\r\nfor _comencement_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 136, _l._ 4, _vironum_.--The MS. has _virronum_. _Viro_ is\r\ngiven by Ducange as synonymous with _baro_, and is supposed to be\r\nderived from _vir_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 137, _ll._ 15, 16, _sonme ... prodhonme_.--In old manuscripts\r\nit is quite impossible to say whether the scribe meant _n_ or _u_,\r\nunless we know otherwise which it ought to be, and the _n_ in words\r\nof the form of those just quoted may perhaps be intended for _u_.\r\nBut I am rather inclined to think such was not the case.\r\n\r\n_P._ 138, _l._ 34, _Sympringham_.--The order of Sempringham,\r\ncommonly called Gilbertine canons, was founded by Sir Gilbert de\r\nSempringham, in the first half of the twelfth century. One of its\r\npeculiarities was the establishment of monks and nuns in the same\r\nhouse, though their different habitations were carefully separated,\r\nand all intercourse between them strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\nNigellus Wireker speaks of this as a newly established order,\r\nand satirizes the near collocation of nuns and monks in a spirit\r\nsimilar to that of our song:--\r\n\r\n      Canonici missas tantum, reliquumque sorores\r\n          Explent; officii debita jura sui.\r\n      Corpora, non voces, murus disjungit, in unum\r\n          Psallant directe psalmitis absque metro.\r\n\r\nAnd again, in describing his own order, he says, archly,--\r\n\r\n      Quid de Semplingama? quantum? vel qualia sumam?\r\n          Nescio, nam nova res me dubitare facit.\r\n      Hoc tamen ad præsens nulla ratione remittam,\r\n          Namque necem nimis fratribus esse reor;\r\n      Quod nunquam nisi clam, nullaque sciente sororum,\r\n          Cum quocunque suo fratre manere licet.\r\n\r\n_P._ 139, _l._ 61, _De Beverleye_.--The monks of Beverley were\r\nFranciscans.\r\n\r\n_P._ 140, _l._ 71, _De Hospitlers_.--The order of Knights\r\nHospitalers, founded during the first crusades, was introduced\r\ninto England about the year 1100. They were laymen, and, from an\r\nhumble beginning, they became exceedingly rich and proud. In the\r\nPatent Rolls (45 Edw. III.) we find that the King “constituit\r\nRicardum de Everton visitatorem Hospitalis S. Joannis Jerusalem in\r\nAnglia ad reprimendam religiosorum insolentiam, et ad observandam\r\nreligiosorum honestatem.” See Ellis’s Dugdale, vol. vi. p. 786.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 79, _De Chanoynes_.--The regular canons were a less\r\nstrict order than the other monks in general, and followed the rule\r\nof St. Augustine. One of the rules of their order was expressed\r\nsimply thus--“Carnem vestram domate jejuniis et abstinentia escæ\r\nquantum valetudo permittit.” They appear to have been particularly\r\nenjoined frequent abstinence from flesh. However, at the time when\r\nthis song was written, they seem not to have observed their rule\r\nin this respect very strictly. Rutebeuf says of them (Jubinal’s\r\nRutebeuf, vol. i. p. 239)--\r\n\r\n      En l’ordre des canoines qu’on dist Saint-Augustin,\r\n      Ils vivent à plenté, sans noise et sans hustin.\r\n      Je lo que leur soviègne au soir et au matin\r\n      Que la chars bien nourie porte à l’âme venin.\r\n\r\n_P._ 141, _l._ 95, _de Moyne Neirs_.--The Black Monks were the\r\nBenedictines.\r\n\r\n_P._ 142, _l._ 115, _Des Chanoygnes Seculers_.--The luxury of the\r\nsecular canons is often alluded to by the early satirists. Nigellus\r\nWireker says of them--\r\n\r\n      Illud præcipue tamen instituere, tenendum\r\n          Omnibus in tota posteritate sua,\r\n      Lex vetus ut suasit, ne quilibet absque sua sit,\r\n          Et quod quisque suas possit habere duas.\r\n      Hi sunt qui mundum cum flore cadente tenentes,\r\n          Ne sic marcescat, sæpe rigare student.\r\n      Hi sunt qui faciunt quidquid petulantia carnis\r\n          Imperat, ut vitiis sit via prona suis.\r\n\r\nRutebeuf (ed. Jubinal, vol. i. p. 239) says that there were many of\r\nthem--\r\n\r\n                ----qui ont grant signorie,\r\n      Qui poi font por amis et assés por amie.\r\n\r\n_P._ 143, _l._ 133, _Gris Moignes_.--Perhaps the Cistercians.\r\nIn a poem on the Grey Monks, _De Grisis Monachis_ (MS. Cotton.\r\nVespas. A. XIX. fol. 56, r^o), which will be found among the works\r\nof Walter Mapes, they are ridiculed for the same arrangement of\r\nclothing,--\r\n\r\n      Carent femoralibus partes turpiores,\r\n      Veneris ut usibus sint paratiores,\r\n      Castitatis legibus absolutiores;\r\n      In cunctis hominibus nulli sunt pejores.\r\n\r\nThe _Albi Monachi_ are similarly satirized by Nigellus Wireker for\r\ngoing without breeches. The Friars de Sacco wore no breeches under\r\ntheir robes.\r\n\r\n_P._ 144, _l._ 154, _l’Ordre de Cilence_.--Perhaps the Carthusian\r\nmonks, a branch of the Benedictines, whose order, which was\r\npeculiarly strict, was introduced into England by Henry II. They\r\nwere enjoined to live in separate cells, and to keep very strict\r\nsilence, and have little communication with each other.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 169, _Les Frere Menours_.--The Friars Minors were better\r\nknown as Franciscans, and in France as the Cordeliers. Their order\r\nenjoined, above all things, poverty and humility. They were not to\r\nride when travelling, unless some manifest necessity or infirmity\r\nobliged them. See Dugdale, vi. 1505.\r\n\r\n_P._ 145, _l._ 188.--The MS. has _en autre_, which seems to be a\r\nmere error for _ne autre_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 146, _l._ 194, _des Prechours_.--The preaching friars were the\r\nDominicans, called, in France, Jacobins. This order was introduced\r\ninto England in 1221. Rutebeuf says that instead of adhering to\r\ntheir primitive humility and poverty, the Jacobins became the\r\nrichest and most overbearing of all the orders. Jubinal, vol. i.\r\npp. 152, 175-179.\r\n\r\n_P._ 148, _l._ 240, _devyns_ seems to be a mere variation of\r\n_devys_, thus spelt in order to accommodate the rhyme.\r\n\r\n_P._ 149. SONG OF THE HUSBANDMAN.--This Song is in many parts\r\nextremely difficult to translate, from the numerous words in it\r\nwhich do not occur elsewhere, as well as from the abruptness of the\r\nphraseology. The same may be said of one or two other songs printed\r\nfrom the same manuscript.\r\n\r\n_P._ 154, _l._ 14, _halymotes_.--This word means literally _holy\r\nmeetings_. It is translated _sabbath_, in the supposition that\r\nthere is some allusion to the popular notion of the festive\r\nmeetings of the devils and the witches.\r\n\r\n_P._ 160. SONG ON THE SCOTTISH WARS.--The copy of this Song\r\npreserved among the manuscripts of Clare Hall was first pointed out\r\nby Mr. Hunter, in the Appendix to the last Report of the Record\r\nCommission. I have obtained a copy of part of it by the kindness\r\nof Mr. Halliwell, who was unable from different circumstances\r\nto continue his transcript beyond the 72nd line. The Oxford MS.\r\nI only know through Mr. Halliwell’s description of it: to judge\r\nby the articles contained in this MS., I should be inclined to\r\nthink they were mostly copied from the Cottonian MS. Titus A. XX.\r\nIn the Cottonian MS., Claudius D. VI. this poem bears the title\r\n“Commendatio Gentis Anglorum et processus guerræ inter Anglos et\r\nScotos.” In the Clare Hall MS. the Song is attributed to the “Prior\r\nde Blithe.” The Prior of Blythe, in Nottinghamshire, at this time,\r\nwas William Burdon. See Ellis’s Dugdale, iv. 621. The MS. in the\r\nSloane Library seems to be a transcript from a monastic register,\r\nperhaps of Alnwick, in Northumberland, for the reference in the\r\nmargin is, “Regist. Prem. fol. 59, a.” It is there attributed\r\nto the Prior of Alnwick. The original title seems to have been\r\n“Rithmus bonus de bello Scotiæ ad Dunbarre;” which the transcriber\r\nhad first copied, and then, after erasing it, substituted the\r\nfollowing, “Prioris Alnwicensis de Bello Scotico apud Dunbarr,\r\ntempore regis Edwardi I., dictamen sive rithmus Latinus; quo de\r\nWillielmo Wallace, Scotico illo Robin Whood, plura, sed invidiose,\r\ncanit.” Ritson, in his preface to Robin Hood, was misled by this\r\nlatter title, and cites it as a proof that this hero was popular in\r\nthe thirteenth century. In MS. Cotton. Titus A. XX. a hand of the\r\nsixteenth century ascribes this poem to Robert Baston.\r\n\r\nIt will already have been observed by the reader, that, in verse\r\nof this kind, the fourth line of each tetrastich is an hexameter\r\n(sometimes a pentameter), taken from some poet then popular,\r\nand often from a classic writer. In the MS. from which the\r\nSloane transcript was made, the authorities for the hexameters,\r\nin the present Song, were indicated in the margin. They are\r\nas follows:--_ll._ 4, _Morus_.--8, _Cato_.--†8, _Cato_.--†12,\r\n_Poetria_.--†16, _Oracius_.--12, _Cato_.--16, _Doctrinale_.--20,\r\n_Doctrinale_.--24, _De proprio_.--28, _Doctrinale_.--32,\r\n_Cartul._--36, _Urbanus_.--40, _Doctrinale_.--44, _Morus_.--48,\r\n_Theodorus_.--52, _De proprio_.--56, _Vulgat._--60, _Pu_....--64,\r\n_Vulgat._--68, _Buliardus_.--72, _Oracius_.--76, _Oracius_.--80,\r\n_Oracius_.--84, _Cato_.--88, _Ovidius_.--92, _Doctrinale_.--96,\r\n_Cato_.--100, _Cato_.--104, _Ovidius_.--108, _Cato_.--112,\r\n_Cato_.--116, _Cato_. (?)--120, _Cato_.--124, _Cato_.--128,\r\n_Cato_.--132, _Doctrinale_.--136, _Cato_.--140, _Cato_.--144,\r\n_Poeta_.--148, _Poeta_.--152, _Orasius_.--156, _Virgilius_.--160,\r\n_Statius_.--†164, _Oratius_.--†168, _Teodorus_.--164,\r\n_Omerus_.--168, _Ovid. Omer._--172, _Cartul._--176, _Veritas\r\nevangelica_.--180, _De proprio_.--184, _Ovidius_.--188,\r\n_Vulgat._--192, _Doctrinale_.--196, _Vulgat._--200,\r\n_Doctrinale_.--204, _Idem_.--208, _Oracius_.--212, _De Vulg._--216,\r\n_Doctrinale_.--220, _Amianus_.\r\n\r\nIn the above list of names, _Poetria_ refers to the celebrated\r\nwork of Galfridus de Vinesauf. _Poeta_ seems to be a mere error\r\nof the scribe for _Poetria_. _Doctrinale_ is here only another\r\nname for the _Parabolæ_ of Alanus de Insulis. _Cato_ refers to the\r\nwell-known _Disticha_. _De proprio_ means that the verse is of the\r\nauthor’s own making.\r\n\r\n_P._ 164, _l._ 44, _Joannis_, John Baliol.--In the Cottonian MS.\r\nClaudius D. VI. the following lines are here inserted, which\r\nevidently do not belong to the poem:\r\n\r\n               “_Exprobratio Scotorum._\r\n      Caude causantur, regnarunt, apocapantur;\r\n      Privantur caude, fas fandi, Scotia, plaude.\r\n                _Responsio Anglorum._\r\n      Scotia scotabit strebæ, Scotus vix latitabit;\r\n      Anglia, jam pange, fas fandi, Scotia, plange.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 168, _l._ 102, _Johannem Warenniæ_.--This was the same John de\r\nWarenne, Earl of Surrey, who, staunch to the party of Henry III.,\r\nhad escaped from the battle of Lewes. He commanded the English army\r\nat the battle of Dunbar, was afterwards made Governor or Guardian\r\nof Scotland, and was again at the head of the English forces when\r\nthey were defeated at Stirling.\r\n\r\n_P._ 169, _l._ 1, _Quod Trentam non transient_.--The King had\r\ncarried with him to London the Scottish knights whom he most\r\nsuspected, and, before he went to Flanders, he exacted from them\r\nsolemn oaths that during his absence they would not repass the\r\nTrent without his permission.\r\n\r\n_P._ 170, _l._ 138, _ad Strivelyne_.--The battle of Stirling was\r\nfought on Thursday the 11th of September, 1297.\r\n\r\n_P._ 171, _l._ 141, _comes dux Anglorum_.--The Earl of Surrey\r\n(Warenne).\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 147, _Levenax et Ricardus Lundi_.--For an account of\r\nthis reverse, and the part which the Earl of Levenax (Lennox) and\r\nRichard Lundi acted, see Knighton, in Twisden, coll. 2516, et seq.\r\n\r\n_P._ 172, _l._ 163.--This line is evidently corrupt; but, as it is\r\nonly found in one MS., I have no means of correcting it.\r\n\r\n_P._ 173, _l._ 163, _Cremare Northumbriam_.--The invasion of\r\nNorthumberland and the burning of Hexham and Corbridge are told by\r\nMatthew of Westminster, p. 427. See also Peter Langtoft, in the\r\npresent volume, p. 287; and Knighton, coll. 2520, et seq. None of\r\nthem mention the damages done at Alnwick.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 167, _Vesey, Morley, Somervile, Bertram_.--The poet\r\nseems to refer to members of those families who had distinguished\r\nthemselves in opposing the inroads of the Scots at different\r\nperiods, but who were dead at the time of this invasion.\r\n\r\n_P._ 174, _l._ 186, _Willelmo datum est militare pignus_.--On his\r\nreturn from the expedition into England, Wallace was solemnly\r\ninstalled Guardian of Scotland.\r\n\r\n_P._ 176, _l._ 205, _die Magdalenæ_.--The battle of Falkirk, so\r\nfatal to the Scots, was fought on St. Mary Magdalen’s day, the 22nd\r\nof July, 1298.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 211, _trutannus_.--This word is the origin of the\r\nmodern word _truant_. Its primary meaning has not been accurately\r\nascertained, but it seems to have been most generally used for\r\na person who wandered about, and gained his living by false\r\npretences, or passed himself under a different character to that\r\nwhich really belonged to him. It is applied sometimes to abbots or\r\npriors who lived abroad and neglected their monasteries, or to\r\nmonks who had quitted their houses, as in the passage of Giraldus,\r\nquoted at p. 369.\r\n\r\n_P._ 178, _l._ 234, _Margaretam reginam_.--Edward married, in\r\nsecond nuptials, Margaret, sister of the King of France.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 243, _Comyn, Karryk, Umfraville_.--Three of the most\r\nactive leaders of the Scots in their opposition to Edward. The Earl\r\nof Karrik was Robert Bruce. Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus,\r\nhad been one of Edward’s Commissioners for manning and fortifying\r\nthe castles in Scotland.\r\n\r\n_P._ 183, _l._ 11, _collectio lanarum_.--The oppressive duty upon\r\nwool, which was the staple of English commerce at that period, was\r\nseverely felt and complained of. In 1296, the King seized all the\r\nwool in the merchants’ warehouses, and sold it for his own profit,\r\npaying for it, as usual, with tallies, and promises to repay\r\nthem to the full. “Ministri regis omnes saccos lanæ, quinarium\r\nnumerum excedentes, datis talliis, acceperunt ad opus regis, et ab\r\nunoquoque sacco, numerum quinarium non excedente, ab ipsis eorum\r\ndominis, nomine _malæ totæ_, xl. solidos extorserunt.” Hemingford,\r\np. 110.\r\n\r\n_P._ 186, _l._ 11, _de fust manger_ (de fusto manducare).--In low\r\nLatin, _fustum_ was a generic name for everything made of wood.\r\nIt need hardly be said that it means here the plates and other\r\nutensils of the table, which among the lower classes were generally\r\nof this material. It would be more reasonable, says the writer of\r\nthe song, if the court would eat out of wooden vessels, and pay for\r\ntheir provisions with silver, than to live sumptuously with plate,\r\nand only pay their victuals with wooden tallies.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 13, _Est vitii signum pro victu solvere lignum_.--The\r\nKing’s purveyors were a great grievance to the peasantry. In\r\nthe curious poem of “King Edward and the Shepherd” (printed by\r\nHartshorne from a MS. in the University Library, Cambridge), the\r\nlatter personage is made to say:--\r\n\r\n      “In Wynsour was I borne;\r\n      Hit is a myle but here beforne,\r\n          The town then maist thou see.\r\n      I am so pyled with the Kyng,\r\n      That I most fle fro my wonyng,\r\n          And therefore woo is me.\r\n      I hade catell, now have I non;\r\n      Thay take my bestis, and don thaim slon,\r\n          And payen but _a stick of tre_.”\r\n\r\nAnd when the King, in disguise, promises to obtain redress, the\r\nShepherd proceeds--\r\n\r\n      “Sir,” he seid, “be seynt Edmonde,\r\n      Ther is owand .iiii. pounde\r\n          And odd twa schillyng.\r\n      _A stikke_ I have to my witnesse,\r\n      _Off hasill_ I mene that hit is,\r\n          I ne have non other thyng.\r\n          *    *    *    *\r\n      Thei do but gode, the kynges men,\r\n      Thei ar worse then sich ten\r\n          That bene with hym no dell.\r\n      Thei goo aboute be .viij. or nyne,\r\n      And done the husbondes mycull pyne,\r\n          That carfull is their mele.\r\n      Thei take geese, capons, and henne,\r\n      And alle that ever thei may with renne,\r\n          And reves us our catell.\r\n      Sum of them was bonde sore,\r\n      And afturwarde honget therfore,\r\n          For soth as I you say.\r\n      Ȝet ar ther of them nyne moo;\r\n      For at my hows thei were also,\r\n          Certis, ȝisturday.\r\n      Thei toke my hennes and my geese,\r\n      And my schepe with all the fleese,\r\n          And ladde them forth away.\r\n      Be my doȝtur thei lay al nyȝt.\r\n      To come agayne thei have me hyȝt;\r\n          Of helpe I wolde yow pray.\r\n      With me thei lefte alle their thyng,\r\n      That I am sicur of theire comyng,\r\n          And that me rewes sore.\r\n      I have fayre chamburs thre;\r\n      But non of them may be with me\r\n          While that thei be thore.\r\n      Into my cart-hows thei me dryfe;\r\n      Out at the dur thei put my wyfe,\r\n          For she is olde gray-hare.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 187. SONG ON THE FLEMISH INSURRECTION.--This Song was printed\r\nby Ritson, in his _Ancient Songs_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 188, _l._ 16, _Peter Conyng_.--Peter Coning (in English, Peter\r\nKing,) was a weaver of Bruges. A brief account of this insurrection\r\nis given in Matthew of Westminster, p. 444. See, for a more\r\ncomplete narrative, Michelet’s Histoire de France, vol. iii. p. 76.\r\n\r\n_P._ 189, _l._ 8, _avowerie_.--This is the low Latin _advocaria_.\r\nSee Ducange, in voce.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 11, _hou_.--The MS. has _hout_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 189, _l._ 17, _to clynken huere basyns of bras_.--This\r\ncircumstance occurred on the 21st March, 1302, at the beginning\r\nof the insurrection. In the towns of Flanders, as in the boroughs\r\nin England, the people were called up in an insurrection by the\r\nsound of the church bell. There was a famous distich on the bell of\r\nRoland, at Bruges--\r\n\r\n      Roelandt, Roelandt, als ick kleppe dan ist brandt,\r\n      Als ick luye, dan ist storm in Vlaenderlandt.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, the people dared not go to their bell,\r\non account of their French governors, so they beat their brass\r\nbasins:--cumque ad campanam civitatis non auderent accedere, pelves\r\nsuas pulsantes ... omnem multitudinem concitarent. Meyer, Annal. in\r\na. 1301, p. 90.\r\n\r\n_P._ 191, _l._ 9, _Conyng_.--This word, in English, meant a\r\n_rabbit_, and is here made the subject of a pun. In Flemish, it\r\nsignified _king_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 193, _ll._ 17, 18, _Awey thou ȝunge pope!... Thou hast lore\r\nthin cardinals_.--_P._ 194, _l._ 2, _Do the forth to Rome_.--An\r\nallusion to the dissensions between the Pope and the family of the\r\nColonnas.--“Illis etiam diebus, dominus papa, fidei et orationum\r\nquæ erant beati Petri oblitus, assumens quæ non erant ejus, tam\r\naurum videlicet a viduis et orphanis quam argentum, non viduis\r\net orphanis, sed militibus bellicosis illud erogare curavit,\r\ncontra schema quorundam cardinalium, eos denique degradando, et\r\ncontra regem Siciliæ guerram movendo. Sed dicti regis exercitus de\r\ngaleatis turmis domini papæ multa millia viriliter necaverunt.”\r\nMatthew of Westminster, p. 432. This was the famous Pope Boniface\r\nVIII., who suffered so much from the persecutions of the King of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _fot lome_, probably means _foot-lame_, lame of foot.\r\nIt occurs again in p. 335 of the present volume.\r\n\r\n_P._ 195. A SONG ON THE TIMES.--The MS. from which this song is\r\ntaken, MS. Harl. No. 913, was written in Ireland, about the year\r\n1308, by an English monk. For a detailed description of it, see Mr.\r\nCrofton Croker’s _Popular Songs of Ireland_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 196, _l._ 19, _hoblurs_.--The name _hoblurs_ (hobellarii) was\r\ngiven properly to a kind of light-armed soldiers.\r\n\r\n_P._ 198, _l._ 14, _geet_.--This word should probably be translated\r\n_goats_, rather than _kids_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 199, _l._ 7, _anone_.--In the MS. this word is explained by\r\nthe original scribe in the margin as “at one time.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 206. SONG AGAINST THE SCHOLASTIC STUDIES.--In the Cottonian\r\nMS. from which this song is taken, a hand of the 16th century has\r\nwritten in the margin that it was the work of Robert Baston.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford MS. was pointed out to me by Mr. Halliwell, but I have\r\nnot been able to obtain a collation.\r\n\r\n_P._ 207, _l._ 2, _propere_.--The MS. has ̃p̃pe, the meaning of\r\nwhich is not clear.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _Sicut servus Stichus_.--This name was given to a\r\nservant in the Roman comic writers. It is introduced here for the\r\nsake of rhyme.\r\n\r\n_P._ 208, _l._ 2, _nullus_.--The MS. has _unus_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _Thebanas ... vel Trojanas cædes_.--Referring to the\r\nThebaid of Statius, and the poem _De bello Trojano_ of Joseph of\r\nExeter, both of them at that period popular reading books.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 16, _Telluris_.--The MS. has _Celurus_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 209, _l._ 4, _agro ... positis_.--The MS. has _ager_ and\r\n_positus_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 212. SONG ON THE EXECUTION OF SIR SIMON FRASER.--This song was\r\nprinted by Ritson, in his _Ancient Songs_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 213, _l._ 6, _The Waleis_.--Wallace was taken prisoner at the\r\nsecond battle of Dunbar, in 1305, and was executed at London on the\r\nEve of St. Bartholomew, (Aug. 24) 1306. The places to which his\r\nquarters were sent were Newcastle, Berwick, Perth, and Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _Simond Frysel_.--This was the original form of the\r\nname of Fraser, and is the way in which it is spelt in all the\r\nEnglish documents.\r\n\r\n_P._ 215, _l._ 14, _kyng of somere_.--Matthew of Westminster gives\r\na popular story, that Bruce’s queen had told him in derision, he\r\nwas but a _summer king_, and that his kingdom would scarcely last\r\nin the winter. See Holinshed, p. 314.\r\n\r\n_P._ 215, _l._ 9, _Sire Edward of Carnarvon_.--The Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n_P._ 216, _l._ 10, _Sir Emer de Valence_.--Aylmer de Valence,\r\nsecond Earl of Pembroke, a Baron who was frequently occupied in the\r\nScottish wars, and who was appointed by Edward to be one of the\r\nguardians of his son, Edward II.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 19, _the batayle of Kyrkenclyff_.--Fought, according to\r\nHolinshed, on the next Sunday after Midsummer day, 1306.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 15, _Sire Thomas of Multone_.--Thomas de Multon, of\r\nEgremond, in Cumberland. He was active in the Scottish wars of this\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n_P._ 218, _l._ 17, _Sire Herbert of Morham_.--Apparently a mere\r\nerror of the scribe for Norham. Matthew of Westminster relates the\r\nsame anecdote.\r\n\r\n_P._ 219, _l._ 13, _oure Levedy even_.--The seventh of September,\r\n1306.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 16, _Sire Rauf of Sondwyche_.--Ralph de Sandwich was\r\nconstable of the Tower of London (_constabularius turris London_).\r\n\r\n_P._ 221, _l._ 7, _a curtel of burel_.--_Burellus_, in low Latin,\r\n_bureau_ or _burel_ in old French, was a kind of coarse and common\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\n_P._ 222, _l._ 9, _tu-brugge_.--Perhaps this word means a\r\ndrawbridge. It occurs again in Robert of Gloucester, p. 543:--\r\n\r\n      “And the castel brugge out of the med he barnde fram then ende\r\n      To the tu-brugge along, vor me ne ssolde out wende.”\r\n\r\nWhich means probably that he burnt all that part of the bridge on\r\nthe meadow side up to the place where its communication with the\r\nrest was cut off by the raising of the drawbridge.\r\n\r\n_P._ 223, _l._ 6, _Erl of Asseles_.--John de Strathbogie, Earl of\r\nAthol. He also was captured and executed.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 18, _Tprot, Scot, for thi strif!_--The word _tprot_\r\nappears to be a mere exclamation of contempt. In a poem on “The\r\nPropertees of the Shyres of Engelond,” printed by Hearne in the\r\nIntroduction to the fifth volume of Leland’s Itinerary, we find it\r\nused, as here, against the Scots:--\r\n\r\n      “Northumbrelond hasty and hoot;\r\n      Westmerlond _tprut Scotte_!”\r\n\r\nIt will be found similarly used in a passage quoted in a note\r\nfurther on (p. 391). In Sir Thomas de la More’s Chronicle, it is\r\napplied to King Edward II.:--“_Tprut!_ Sire King!” It seems to be\r\ntaken from the French: in Jean Bodel’s Jeu de S. Nicolas (Théatre\r\nFrançais au Moyen-Age, edited by MM. Monmerqué and Michel) it is\r\nput in the mouths of the common gamblers in a public-house:--\r\n\r\n      “_Tproupt! tproupt!_ bevons hardiement;\r\n      Ne faisons si le coc emplat.”--(p. 183.)\r\n\r\nAnd again, immediately after (p. 184):--\r\n\r\n      “_Tproupt! tproupt!_ où que soit passé, Diex!”\r\n\r\n_P._ 223, _l._ 21, _with the longe shonkes_.--King Edward, still\r\nknown popularly as Edward Long-shanks.\r\n\r\n_P._ 224. SONG ON THE VENALITY OF THE JUDGES.--After this song\r\nwas printed, I found another copy of it in MS. Reg. 12, c. XII.\r\nfol. 1, v^o. of reign of Edw. II., written likewise as prose,\r\nwhich presents the following variations:--_P._ 224, _ll._ 1, 2,\r\n_esuriunt | Et faciunt justitiam | et od._--7, _exhennia_.--9,\r\nthis line is omitted, and the following begins _Sed quæ_.--11,\r\n_et aure non_.--13, _Sed modo miro more_.--15, _ad peric._--17,\r\n_ambiant_.--_P._ 225, _l._ 1, _hæc_.--7, _nam_ is omitted.--8, _Qui\r\nsensum_.--9, _ei pure_.--14, _Quid ergo Jhesu bone_.--_P._ 226,\r\n_l._ 1, _accedit_.--2, _secretius_.--7, _potest_.--_ll._ 12-18 are\r\nplaced after _l._ 10 in the next page.--14, _dona_.--15, _et hoc\r\npro l._--17, _quamvis prius_.--19, _Si quædam pulcra nobilis |\r\ndecora vel am._--_P._ 227, _l._ 2, _hoc_.--12, _ut exprimant_.--13,\r\n_vocantur_.--14, _priores_.--18, _Sed quid_.--_P._ 228, _l._ 1,\r\n_quid laboras_.--2, _quid facis_.--8, _ibis Omere, foras_.--9, _De\r\nvinctibus_.--11, _enumerare_.--19, _Est salsum totum_. This MS.\r\nends with this verse.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _encennia_.--This word answers as nearly as may be to\r\nthe modern word _jewels_. The other MS., of which the variations\r\nare given above, reads _exennia_, i. e. _treasures_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 225, _l._ 17, _cedunt_.--In the MS. the scribe has written\r\nover this word “i. re,” that is, “i. e. recedunt.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 226, _l._ 21, _cum capite cornuto_.--The head dress of the\r\nladies of rank and fashion at this period was arranged in the form\r\nof two horns.\r\n\r\n_P._ 227, _l._ 13, _relatores_, “qui querelam ad judices referunt.”\r\nDucange.\r\n\r\n_P._ 229, _l._ 13, _transmittantur_.--The MS. has _transmutantur_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 229, _l._ 18, _averia_.--The term _averium_ is commonly used\r\nto signify all kinds of moveable property; but more particularly to\r\nsignify cattle and horses.\r\n\r\n_P._ 230, _l._ 1, _clericos_.--The scribe has written above this\r\nword, in the MS. “i. pauperes.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 231. THE OUTLAW’S SONG OF TRAILEBASTON.--This song also was\r\nprinted by Sir Francis Palgrave in the collection mentioned in a\r\nformer note. The notion that the judges were called Trailebastons\r\non account of the hastiness of their proceedings, is quite\r\nincorrect. The term was applied not to the judges, but to the\r\npersons judged, who received this name because they carried with\r\nthem long staffs. An account of the origin of the Trailebastons\r\nwill be found in the extract of Peter Langtoft, at p. 318 of the\r\npresent volume. The proceedings against them led to many abuses,\r\nand were often made the means of gratifying personal revenge. The\r\nstatute against the Trailebastons was continued in force through\r\nthe reigns of Edward II. and Edward III.\r\n\r\n_P._ 232, _l._ 1, _souz_.--In old French and Anglo-Norman, the word\r\n_sous_ was not used in its present sense, but represented the Latin\r\n_solidos_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _le bois de Belregard_.--Perhaps a fictitious name,\r\ninvented by the poet.\r\n\r\n_P._ 233, _l._ 3, _ly Martyn ... ly Knoville_.--_l._ 5, _Spigurnel\r\n... Belflour_.--By the following commission, given in Rymer, we\r\nfind that these Barons were the commissioners appointed to judge\r\nthe Trailebastons in the western counties of England. There can\r\nbe little doubt that _Belflour_ in the song is meant for the\r\nname which in the commission is _Bellafagus_. This document is\r\ncurious, both for the light it throws on the subject, and for\r\nthe circumstance that it fixes the period at which the song was\r\nwritten; it bears date at Westminster, April 6, 1305.\r\n\r\n“_De transgressionibus nominatis Trailbaston audiendis et\r\nterminandis per totum regnum._--Rex delectis et fidelibus suis,\r\nWilielmo Martyn, Henrico Spigurnell, Wilielmo de Knovill, Rogero\r\nde Bellafago, et Thomæ de la Hyde, salutem.--Quia quamplures\r\nmalefactores, et pacis nostræ perturbatores, homicidia,\r\ndeprædationes, incendia, et alia dampna quamplurima nocte dieque\r\nperpetrantes, vagantur et discurrunt in boscis, in parcis,\r\net aliis locis diversis, tam infra libertates quam extra, in\r\ncomitatibus Cornubiæ, Devoniæ, Sumersetiæ, Dorsetiæ, Herefordiæ,\r\nWygorniæ, Salopiæ, Staffordiæ, Wiltes’, et Suthamptoniæ, et ibidem\r\nreceptantur, in maximum periculum tam hominum per partes illas\r\ntranseuntium, quam ibidem morantium, et nostri contemptum, ac pacis\r\nnostræ læsionem manifestam, ut accepimus: Per quorum incursus\r\npoterunt pejora prioribus de facili evenire, nisi remedium super\r\nhoc citius apponatur: Nos, eorum malitiæ in hac parte obviare, et\r\nhujusmodi dampnis et periculis præcavere volentes, assignavimus\r\nvos justiciarios nostros: Ad inquirendum, per sacramentum tam\r\nmilitum quam aliorum proborum et legalium hominum de comitatibus\r\nprædictis, tam infra libertates quam extra, per quos rei veritas\r\nmelius sciri poterit, qui sunt illi malefactores, et eorum scienter\r\nreceptatores, et eis consentientes, vim et auxilium præbentes, seu\r\ndictas transgressiones fieri procurantes et præcipientes: Et etiam\r\nad inquirendum de illis, qui pro muneribus suis pactum fecerunt\r\net faciunt cum malefactoribus, et pacis nostræ perturbatoribus,\r\net eos conduxerunt et conducunt ad verberandum, vulnerandum, male\r\ntractantandum et interficiendum plures de regno nostro, in feriis,\r\nmercatis, et aliis locis, in dictis comitatibus, pro inimicitia,\r\ninvidia, malitia, et etiam pro eo quod in assisis, juratis,\r\nrecognitionibus, et inquisitionibus factis de feloniis, positi\r\nfuerunt, et veritatem dixerunt: unde per conductionem hujusmodi\r\nmalefactorum, juratores assisarum, juratorum recognitionum, et\r\ninquisitionum illarum, præ timore dictorum malefactorum et horum\r\nminarum, sæpius veritatem dicere seu dictos malefactores indictare\r\nminime aussi fuerunt, et sunt: Et etiam ad inquirendum de illis\r\nqui hujusmodi munera dederunt et dant: et quantum et quibus:\r\net qui hujusmodi munera receperunt et recipiunt: et a quibus,\r\net qualiter, et quo modo: et qui hujusmodi malefactores in sua\r\nmalitia fovent, nutriunt, et manutenent in comitatibus prædictis:\r\nEt etiam de illis, qui, ratione potestatis et dominii sui, aliquos\r\nin eorum protectionem et advocationem pro suo dando susceperunt,\r\net adhuc suscipiunt: Et de illis qui pecuniam ab aliquo, per\r\ngraves minas ei factas, malitiose extorserunt: Et ad felonias et\r\ntransgressiones illas audiendas et terminandas secundum legem et\r\nconsuetudinem regni nostri, et juxta formam ordinationis per nos\r\net consilium nostrum super hoc factæ, et vobis in parliamento\r\nnostro liberatæ: Et etiam ad omnes felonias et transgressiones,\r\nde quibus inquisitiones coram dilectis et fidelibus nostris,\r\nHenrico de Cobeham, Thoma Paynel, Hugone de Sancto Philiberto, et\r\nJohanne Randolf, in prædictis comitatibus Wiltes’ et Suthamtoniæ\r\nfactæ sunt, et per vos, si necesse fuerit, faciendæ, audiendas et\r\nterminandas in forma prædicta:” etc.\r\n\r\n_P._ 235, _l._ 6, _escolage_, answers probably to a low Latin word\r\n_excollectionem_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 237. A SONG AGAINST THE RETINUES OF THE GREAT PEOPLE.--Half of\r\nthis song is written in the original in short lines, and the other\r\nhalf in long lines, to suit the convenience of the MS. It contains\r\nnumerous popular words and phrases, the meaning of which it is now\r\nvery difficult to ascertain.\r\n\r\n_P._ 242, _l._ 9, _Le rei de Fraunce_.--Edward seems to have long\r\ncherished the design of embarking in a new crusade, which had been\r\nstrongly advocated by the Pope, but he had been hindered by his\r\ncontinued wars and embarrassments, which the writer of the song\r\nattributes to the intrigues of the King of France.\r\n\r\n_P._ 243, _l._ 13, _A Peiters à l’Apostoile_.--Pope Clement the\r\nFifth, who was constantly in hostilities with his Italian subjects,\r\nand little more than a dependent on France, resided a great part of\r\nhis pontificate at Poitiers.\r\n\r\n_P._ 245, _ll._ 5, 6, _Si Aristotle ... e Virgile_.--Aristotle and\r\nVirgil were names in great repute in the popular literature of the\r\nmiddle ages, and were the subject of much legend and romance.\r\n\r\n_P._ 246. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF EDWARD I.--This song had been\r\nalready printed in Percy’s Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.\r\n\r\n_P._ 253. ON THE KING’S BREAKING HIS CONFIRMATION OF MAGNA\r\nCHARTA.--This curious poem is reprinted from an interesting\r\nlittle volume of early poetry, edited and printed privately by\r\nDavid Laing, Esq. and W. B. D. D. Turnbull, Esq. under the title\r\nof “Owain Miles, and other Inedited Fragments of Ancient English\r\nPoetry.” 8vo. Edinburgh, 1837.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 7, _the feire_.--Probably the fair of St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n_P._ 254, _l._ 5, _Of .iiij. wise-men_.--This was a very popular\r\nstory, and found its way into the celebrated Gesta Romanorum.\r\nIt also occurs frequently in a separate and different form in\r\nmanuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The\r\nsentences of the wise men were popular sayings independent of the\r\ntale, and are sometimes found separately. They varied at different\r\nperiods, both as they are found separately, and as they are given\r\nin the different recensions of the story. It would be a curious\r\nand interesting work to collect together such popular political\r\nproverbs in chronological order. I have met with this story in a\r\nMS. in the British Museum contemporary with the present song, in\r\nwhich, if I remember right, both the sayings and the explanations\r\nof them are given in full both in English and Latin, but I have\r\nunfortunately mislaid my reference to it. The following is taken\r\nfrom MS. Reg. 5 A. VI. fol. 83 r^o, of the end of the 14th or\r\nbeginning of the 15th cent. A more modern copy, with rather larger\r\ncommentary, will be found in MS. Harl. No. 206, fol. 38, v^o.\r\n\r\n“Legitur quendam Regem quondam fuisse qui habuit 4^{or} Philosophos\r\nin regno suo. In quo regno multæ plagæ, multa infortunia, et\r\nmulti defectus fiebant in populis. Rex autem videns se ipsum\r\nnullo peccato mortali vulneratum, mirabatur valde, et diligenter\r\ninquirebat a prædictis 4^{or} Philosophis qua de causa hæc\r\ninfortunia magis agebantur in populis in tempore suo quam in\r\ntempore prædecessorum suorum.\r\n\r\n“Primus Philosophus dixit, _Miȝt is riȝt_; Unde illud Ysaiæ,\r\n69, Conversum est retrorsum judicium, et justitia longe stetit;\r\ncorruit in platea veritas, et æquitas non potuit ingredi. _Liȝt is\r\nnyȝt_; unde Ewang., Væ homini illi per quem scandalum venit! Per\r\neum scandalum venit qui alios malo exemplo corrumpit. Dominus in\r\nLevetico dixit: Time, inquit, Dominum Deum tuum, ut vivere possit\r\nfrater tuus apud te; hoc est, ut sic vivas quod frater tuus per\r\ntuum exemplum vitam possit habere non mortem. _Fiȝt is fliȝt_; unde\r\nAugustinus: Bene agere et illicita non prohibere consensus erroris\r\nest. Gregorius: Facientis proculdubio culpam habet qui quod potest\r\ncorrigere negligit emendare.\r\n\r\n“Secundus Philosophus dixit, _One is too_; unde Ewang.: Omne\r\nregnum in se divisum desolabitur. Ambrosius: Sicut sine via nullus\r\npervenit quo tendit, sic sine caritate, quæ dicta est via, non\r\nambulare possunt homines, sed errare. _Frend is foo_; hoc potest\r\nintelligi quando homines et præcipue potentes veram pacem vel\r\njustitiam aut Dei ecclesiam strangulant, quibus principaliter\r\npropter Deum militare deberent. _Weele is woo_; Gregorius: Qui bona\r\nmundi diligit, velit nolit timori et dolori bene succumbit. Seneca:\r\nAvarus nisi dum moritur nichil bene facit.\r\n\r\n“Tertius Philosophus dixit, _Lust has leve_; unde Paulus: Si\r\nsecundum carnem vixeritis, moriemini. Jeronimus: Qui post carnem\r\nambulant, in ventrem et libidinem proni, quasi irrationalia jumenta\r\nreputantur. _Thef is refe_; unde Jeremias: Væ qui ædificant domum\r\nsuam non in justitia! Robertus Lincolniensis: Væ illis qui dicunt,\r\nfaciamus mala, ut veniant bona, quorum damnatio justa est! _Pride\r\nhas slef_; unde in Ps.: Irritaverunt eum in adinventionibus suis,\r\net multiplicata est in eis ruina. David autem dixit: Non habitabit\r\nin medio domus meæ qui facit superbiam.\r\n\r\n“Quartus Philosophus dixit, _Wille is red_; unde per Psalmistam\r\ndicitur: Noluit intelligere ut bene aget. Prover. 12: Via stulti\r\nrecta in oculis ejus; qui autem sapiens est audit consilium.\r\n_Wytte is qued_; unde P.: Erit enim tempus cum sanam doctrinam non\r\nsustinebunt. Augus.: Juventuti malorum hominum venenum est quidquid\r\nvirtus præcipit, esca vero quidquid diabolus suggerit. _Good is\r\nded_; unde in psalmo: Universa vanitas omnis homo vivens, i. vivens\r\nsecundum hominem, non secundum Deum. Augus.: Sicut mors corporalis\r\nseparat animum a corpore, ita peccatum mortale animam a vera vita,\r\nquæ est Deus.”\r\n\r\nIn the following, which is taken from the common printed Gesta\r\nRomanorum, cap. 144, the English is translated.\r\n\r\n“Fertur de quodam Rege cujus regnum in tam subitam devenit\r\nmutationem, quod bonum in malum, verum in falsum, forte in debile,\r\njustum in injustum est mutatum. Quam mutationem Rex admirans, a\r\nquattuor Philosophis sapientissimis causam hujus quæsivit; qui,\r\ninquam, Philosophi post sanam deliberationem ad quattuor portas\r\ncivitates pergentes quilibet eorum tres causas ibi scripsit.\r\nPrimus scripsit, Potentia est justitia, ideo terra sine lege;\r\ndies est nox, ideo terra sine via; fuga est in pugna, ideo regnum\r\nsine honore. Secundus scripsit, Unum est duo, ideo regnum sine\r\nveritate; amicus est inimicus, ideo regnum sine fidelitate; malum\r\nest bonum, ideo terra sine pietate. Tertius scripsit, Ratio habet\r\nlicentiam, ideo regnum sine nomine; fur est præpositus, ideo regnum\r\nsine pecunia; corabola vult esse aquila, ideo nulla discretio in\r\npatria. Quartus scripsit, Voluntas est consiliarius, ideo terra\r\nmale disponitur; denarius dat sententiam, ideo terra male regitur;\r\nDeus est mortuus, ideo totum regnum peccatoribus est repletum.”\r\n\r\nIn the moralisation, these sentences are applied to the time in\r\nwhich it was written. In the English _Gesta Romanorum_ (edited by\r\nSir Frederick Madden for the Roxburghe Club in 1838, and which it\r\nis to be regretted is not published in a popular form), p. 397, we\r\nhave the following version of the story.\r\n\r\n“This is redde in the Cronycles of Rome, that in the tyme of\r\nAntynyane the Emperour, in the citie of Rome befille a grete\r\npestilence of men and bestes, and grete hungre in alle the empire.\r\nThe comons risene agayne her lordes, and agayne her Emperour.\r\nThe Emperour desirede to wete the cause of the tribulacions and\r\ndiseases, and disposede hym for to putte a remedie agayne the\r\nforesaide disease. He callede to hym .iiij. wise Philisophers,\r\nfor to shew hym the cause of the grete vengeaunce; of the whiche\r\nPhilisophers the first saide thus, ‘Gifte is domesman, and Gile is\r\nchapman; the grete holde no lawe, and servauntes have none awe.’\r\nThe seconde saide, ‘Witte is turnede to trechery, and love into\r\nlechery; the holy day into glotonye, and gentrie into vilanie.’\r\nThe thirde saide, ‘Wise men are but scornede, and wedowes be sore\r\nyernede; grete men are but glosede, and smale men borne downe and\r\nmyslovede.’ The fourthe saide, ‘Lordes wexen blynde, and kynnesmen\r\nben unkynde; dethe out of mynde, and trewthe may no man fynde.’”\r\n\r\nThe sentences in this last version are also found frequently in\r\nMSS. in a separate form. An imperfect copy of them will be found\r\nin the _Reliquiæ Antiquæ_, (Pickering, 1839,) p. 58. I have met\r\nrecently with a much more complete copy, agreeing closely with the\r\nsentences in the above tale from the English _Gesta_, but I have\r\nalso unfortunately lost the reference to it, and cannot recall it\r\nto mind at the present moment. In MS. Cotton. Vespas. E. XII. fol.\r\n100, r^o., of the end of the fourteenth century, is given another\r\nLatin version of this story, where the scene is laid at Carthage,\r\nthe King is Hannibal, and instead of the four wise men we have\r\nVirgil, and the sayings are again different from the others. This\r\nversion is important both for the history of the story, and for its\r\nconnexion with the fable of the legendary Virgilius.\r\n\r\n_P._ 256, _l._ 9, _god is ded_.--It will have been observed in the\r\nforegoing note that one of the versions of the story interprets\r\n_god_ by _Deus_;--God is dead,--which is most probably right, and\r\nthe former editors have very properly given the word with a capital.\r\n\r\n_P._ 258. SONGS ON THE DEATH OF PETER DE GAVESTON.--Both these\r\nsongs are parodies upon hymns in the Romish ritual.\r\n\r\n_P._ 260, _l._ 1, _Vult hic comes, et non Petrus, dici_.--The\r\nfavourite was, indeed, extremely angry because people persisted in\r\ncalling him Peter, and obtained a Royal decree that no one should\r\nbe permitted to call him otherwise than Earl of Cornwall in future.\r\n\r\n_P._ 262. THE BATTLE OF BANNOCKBURN.--The text of this poem is\r\nextremely corrupt. It appears, from Mr. Halliwell’s description of\r\nthe MS., that there is another copy of it at Oxford, MS. Rawl. B.\r\n214. This poem is attributed to Robert Baston, a carmelite, who,\r\naccording to a popular story, was present at the battle, and was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Scots. We are told that he was liberated on\r\ncondition of composing a poem to celebrate the valour of the Scots:\r\nthe song here printed is of quite a different character.\r\n\r\n_P._ 262, _l._ 6, _dabantur_.--_Debantur_ in the MS.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _præparare_.--The MS. has _portare_, with “p’p’are”\r\nwritten above.\r\n\r\n_P._ 263, _l._ 9, _conflictus_.--The MS. had _consultus_, which is\r\nchanged into _conflictus_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 10, _Comes heu! Gloverniæ_.--Gilbert de Clare, son of\r\nthat Earl of Gloucester who was so active in the Barons’ wars of\r\nthe reign of Henry III. On his death, at Bannockburn, the title\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 17, _proditorius vir Bartholomeus_.--Perhaps Bartholomew\r\nde Badlesmere, who was Steward of the King’s household, and\r\nattended the King in these wars.\r\n\r\n_P._ 264, _l._ 2, _sex seminum_.--This word evidently represents\r\nthe French _semaines_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 265, _l._ 2, _nimis_.--The MS. has _nims_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 4, _veneficos_.--The MS. has _venifices_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 9, _multiplica_.--In middle-age Latin, the form\r\n_multiplicus_ is frequently used for _multiplex_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 14, _corruerunt_.--The scribe has written _sub_ over the\r\nfirst syllable of this word in the MS., as though he would correct\r\nit to _subruerunt_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 266, _l._ 16, _horridus_.--The MS. has _oridus_, and just\r\nafterwards it seems to have _quievit_ for _crevit_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 267, _l._ 4, _stirps radice_.--The MS. has _radix_, with\r\n_ortus_ written over it; from which it may be conjectured that the\r\noriginal from which the scribe copied had the reading which I have\r\ngiven, and that the word _ortus_ was written over it, or in the\r\nmargin, to supply the construction--_stirps ortus radice Jessæ_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 12, _far_....--The MS. has _far?_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 268. THE OFFICE OF ST. THOMAS OF LANCASTER.--Popular heroes\r\nand patriots were frequently canonised by the people after their\r\ndeath. Such was the case with Simon de Montfort. See p. 124 of the\r\npresent volume. A very curious story of this kind will be found\r\nin William of Newbury, l. 5, cc. 20, 21. The King, in the present\r\ninstance, was obliged to issue a proclamation forbidding the\r\nworship of Earl Thomas of Lancaster.\r\n\r\n_P._ 268, _l._ 2, _Thomam Cantuariæ._--All the popular heroes were\r\ncompared to St. Thomas of Canterbury. We have seen the comparison\r\nused in the case of Simon de Montfort, see p. 125 of the present\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n_P._ 270, _l._ 11, _pater proles erat regia._--Thomas Plantagenet, Earl\r\nof Lancaster, was son of Edmund, younger brother of Edward I.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 12, _matrem ... reginam Navarria._--Blanche, daughter of\r\nRobert, Earl of Artois, and widow of Henry, King of Navarre, who\r\nwas espoused in second marriage to Edmund Plantagenet.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 16, _Benedicti capitur vigilia...., l. 17, die\r\ntertia._--After the battle of Boroughbridge (March 15, 1322), the\r\nEarl of Lancaster took refuge in a chapel, where he was taken on\r\nthe 20th, brought to Pontefract on the 21st, tried on the 22nd, and\r\nbeheaded the same day. The 20th of March was the eve of St. Benet.\r\n\r\n_P._ 271, _l._ 2,_ Hoylandiæ._--Robert de Hoyland (the father of Thomas\r\nde Holand, Earl of Kent, the first husband of Joan, Princess of\r\nWales,) had been sent to collect forces in Lancashire, to assist\r\nthe Earl of Lancaster, but when he had gotten them together, he\r\ndeserted the Earl, and went over with them to the King’s party.\r\n\r\n---- _sudam_ appears to be an error for some other word.\r\n\r\n_P._ 273. PETER LANGTOFT’S CHRONICLE.--The Cambridge MS. contains\r\nonly the history of Edward I., which is given as a complete work,\r\nwith the title, “Ici commence le Brut coment li bon rei Edward\r\ngaigna Escotz e Galis.” The Fairfax MS. seems also to have given\r\nthe same portion of Langtoft’s Chronicle. Since my text was\r\nprinted, Sir Frederick Madden has kindly given me his transcripts\r\nof the English fragments as they stand in the Fairfax MS. No. 24,\r\nin the Bodleian Library, at Oxford, and in the Arundel MS. No. 14,\r\nin the College of Arms. The numerous variations in these lines, and\r\nthe frequent recurrence of lines in one MS. which are omitted in\r\nanother, seem clearly to prove they were fragments of popular songs\r\ninterwoven into the Chronicle by its writer. I ought to say that,\r\nat the time the extracts in the present volume were printed off, it\r\nwas not in my power to have the sheets collated with the original.\r\nIt may also be observed, that it has not been thought proper to\r\ncorrect the text by the various readings, but the translation is\r\nfrequently made from the latter, when the text is evidently wrong.\r\n\r\n_P._ 274, _l._ 15, _Celestine la pape._--Pope Celestin the Fifth, who\r\nwas elected in July, 1294, and abdicated in the December following.\r\n\r\n_P._ 275, _l._ 50, _suz Dover._--An account of this attack upon Dover\r\nwill be found in Matthew of Westminster, p. 424, and in Knighton,\r\ncol. 2502.\r\n\r\n_P._ 278, _l._ 75, _Thomas de Turbevile._--See, on this affair, Matthew\r\nof Westminster, p. 425, Knighton, col. 2502, Hemingford, p. 58.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 83, _Cent lievre de tere._--Robert de Brunne’s version has\r\na hundred pounds of land, i. e. lands of that yearly value.\r\n\r\n_P._ 280, _l._ 106, _Le tierz jour._--Robert de Brunne says--\r\n\r\n      Opon the thrid day, at a toun hamelet,\r\n      Thomas was his pray, as he to mete was set.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 112, _cum traitur est jugé._--Robert of Brunne has given\r\nmore details of Turbeville’s trial than are found in the original.\r\n\r\n_P._ 282, _l._ 135, _Le counte de Nincole._--Henry de Lacy, Earl of\r\nLincoln and Salisbury.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 136, _Sir Willeam de Vescy._--William de Vescy, Lord of\r\nAlnwick, and governor of Scarborough Castle.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 153, _la male rage._--“_Male rage_: Faim extraordinaire,\r\nenragée; _mala rabies_.” Roquefort.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 156, _rivelins._--Apparently a kind of rough boots worn by\r\nthe Scots, so called perhaps on account of their ragged and torn\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n---- _la nue nage._--_Nage_ is the Latin _nates_. The Fairfax and\r\nArundel MS. have here a line or two of the French which is not\r\nfound in the other copies, with the following fragments of English--\r\n\r\n      (F.) Tprut! Skot riveling,\r\n           In unseli timing\r\n               crope thu out of cage.\r\n\r\n      (A.) Tprut!

I had written _wages_ in\r\nthe third line, but, thinking it might be an error of my own, I\r\nventured to change it to _nages_, in conformity with the readings\r\nof the other MSS. I have no doubt that _nages_, the French _nages_\r\n(see before, p. 283, l. 156, and the note), the Latin _nates_,\r\nis the right word. The other reading of the line was perhaps\r\nsubstituted by some one who did not understand the word.\r\n\r\n_P._ 298, _l._ 380, _For Scottes, etc._--Robert of Brunne agrees with\r\nthe present text, in this song. In the Fairfax and Arundel MSS. it\r\nstands thus:--\r\n\r\n      (F.)

In like manner, we still vulgarly call\r\npeople who possess very little sense, _empty bottles_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 304, _l._ 484, _eces;_ another form of _assez_.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 486, _Henri de Perci aid Galwei._--Henry de Percy, nephew\r\nof Warenne, was made keeper of the county of Galloway and the\r\nsheriffdom of Ayr.\r\n\r\n_P._ 305, _l._ 504, _le eveske de Duram._--The famous Anthony Beck,\r\nBishop of Durham, who, at the head of his knights, attended Edward\r\nin all his invasions of Scotland, and commanded one division of the\r\narmy at the battle of Falkirk.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 514, _Kambynoy._--Robert of Brunne translates this passage\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n      Cambinhoy\r\n      Beres him coy,\r\n            that fendes whelp,\r\n      Ther with craft\r\n      He has tham raft,\r\n            it may not help.\r\n      The Trulle the\r\n      Drenge on se,\r\n            thei lenge the fendes tueye,\r\n      The hold tham fer,\r\n      And dar no ner\r\n            than Orkeneye.\r\n      Andrew is wroth,\r\n      The wax him loth,\r\n            for ther pride.\r\n      He is tham fro,\r\n      Now salle thei go,\r\n            schame to betide.\r\n      Thou scabbed Scotte,\r\n      Thi neck, thi hotte,\r\n            the develle it breke,\r\n      It salle be hard\r\n      To here Edward\r\n            ageyn the speke.\r\n      He salle the ken\r\n      Our lond to bren,\r\n            and werre begynne\r\n      Thou getes no thing,\r\n      Bot thi rivelyng\r\n            to hang therinne.\r\n      The sete of the Scone\r\n      Is driven over done,\r\n            to London led;\r\n      I hard wele telle,\r\n      That bagelle and belle\r\n            be filchid and fled.\r\n\r\n_P._ 306, _l._ 521, _Ou il est mort | al mouster._--The Monastery of\r\nHexham, which the Scots had burnt, was dedicated to their patron\r\nSaint, St. Andrew. Hemingford remarks, in a similar manner, the\r\nimpiety of the Scots in burning the church of their patron. This\r\nwriter, in many parts of his Chronicle, seems to paraphrase and\r\nenlarge upon the narrative of Peter Langtoft.\r\n\r\n_P._ 307, _l._ 550, _Deus! cum Merlins._--The Cambridge MS. has _Teus_,\r\nwith a great T., by an error of the illuminator. Robert of Brunne,\r\nin translating this part of the Chronicle, quotes the original\r\nauthor, Peter Langtoft, as his authority:--\r\n\r\n      Nou tels Pers, on his maners, a grete selcouth,\r\n      He takis witnes, that it soth es, of Merlyn mouth, etc.\r\n\r\nThe MS. from which Hearne printed contained a marginal note, “De\r\nunione Scotiæ et Angliæ secundum dicta Petri et Bridlingtone,”\r\nmeaning that Bridlington had something similar in his prophecies.\r\nHearne, not aware that it is Peter Langtoft to whom the writer\r\nrefers, alters it to Petri de Bridlington; although, if he had\r\nreferred to Bale, he would have found that Bridlington’s name was\r\nJohn, and not Peter.\r\n\r\n_P._ 309, _l._ 582, _Jon e Thomas ... Cuthbert._--John of Beverley,\r\nThomas of Canterbury, and Cuthbert of Durham. These three saints\r\nare elsewhere spoken of in Peter Langtoft as Edward’s especial\r\npatrons and aiders.\r\n\r\n_P._ 310, _l._ 607, _Des biens de seint eglise._--See, on this\r\ntransaction, Matthew of Westminster, p. 428, and Hemingford, p. 107.\r\n\r\n_P._ 311. I suspect that the lines here inclosed in brackets,\r\nas not found in the Cambridge MS., were missed by myself in\r\ntranscribing.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 613, _disime dener._--Robert of Brunne says the twelfth\r\npenny.\r\n\r\n_P._ 315, _l._ 683, _jeo crei._--The manner in which the writer here\r\nspeaks, as well as other expressions in the course of the poem,\r\nseem to show that he wrote down the events as they happened.\r\n\r\n_P._ 316, _l._ 701, _le Sire de Canturbir._--Robert Winchelsey,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, from 1294 to 1313.\r\n\r\n_P._ 317, _l._ 709, _Li sire de Nichole._--Oliver Sutton, Bishop of\r\nLincoln, who died in the November of 1299.\r\n\r\n---- _l._ 714, _L’elyt de Everwyke._--Henry de Newark, who succeeded\r\nto the Archbishopric in 1297, and died in 1299.\r\n\r\n_P._ 318, _l._ 720. These English verses are only found in the\r\nCambridge MS.\r\n\r\n_P._ 320, _l._ 19, _Pur treys souz, &c._--Robert of Brunne translates\r\nthis--\r\n\r\n      Thei profere a man to bete, for tuo schilynges or thre,\r\n      With piked staves grete beten salle he be.\r\n\r\nWe learn from this writer that it was the King who gave them the\r\nname of _Trailebastons_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 321, _l._ 43, _Sire Jon de Meneteft._--He is said to have been\r\nincited by his personal hatred of Wallace to seek out and deliver\r\nthe Scottish Chieftain to his enemies. Robert de Brunne adds\r\nsomething to his original in this place:--\r\n\r\n      Sir Jon of Menetest sewed William so nehi,\r\n      He tok him whan he wend lest, on nyght his leman bi.\r\n      That was thorght treson of Jak Schort his man,\r\n      He was the encheson that Sir Jon so him nam.\r\n      Jak brother had he slayn, the Waleis that is said,\r\n      The more Jak was fayn to do William that braid.\r\n      Selcouthly he endis the man that is fals,\r\n      If he trest on his frendes, thei begile him als\r\n      Begiled is William, taken is and bondon.\r\n      To Inglond with him thei cam, and led him unto London.\r\n\r\nWe may take this occasion of pointing out the impropriety of\r\nquoting Robert de Brunne as Peter Langtoft. Mr. Tytler quotes this\r\nstory of Jack Short upon Langtoft’s authority, which involves two\r\nserious errors, first, making Langtoft say what he did not say,\r\nand, secondly, giving the story on better authority than that on\r\nwhich it really rests, for, in this respect, Robert de Brunne is\r\ncertainly inferior to Langtoft.\r\n\r\n_P._ 323, _l._ 67, _And tus, etc._--Robert of Brunne has six lines of\r\nthis fragment more than in the French MSS.\r\n\r\n      It is not to drede,\r\n      Traytour salle spede,\r\n            als he is worthi,\r\n      His lif salle he tyne,\r\n      And die thorgh pyne,\r\n            withouten merci.\r\n      Thus may men here,\r\n      A ladde for to lere\r\n            to biggen in pays.\r\n      It fallis in his iȝe,\r\n      That hewes over hie,\r\n            with the Walays.\r\n\r\n_P._ 326, _l._ 66, _nu._--In the MS. it is written _n^ou_. Perhaps the\r\n_o_ was added by somebody who thought the orthography should be\r\n_nou_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 327, _l._ 78, _serven the chapele._--This last word, which answers\r\nto capella in the similar passage in the Song at the end of these\r\nnotes (p. 401, l. 21), means here, perhaps, a _wardrobe_.\r\n\r\n_P._ 329, _l._ 126, _amis._--This word is added in the MS. by a later\r\nhand than that which wrote the other part.\r\n\r\n_P._ 336, _l._ 285, _turmentours that comen from clerkes plei._--Men\r\nwho have performed the part of devils, or tormentors, in the\r\nmiracle plays, which were performed by the clerks.\r\n\r\n_P._ 338, _l._ 330, _Theih pleien wid the hinges silver, and breden wod\r\nfor wele._--They use the king’s silver for their own pleasures, and\r\nproduce wood, or tallies, instead of contributing to the prosperity\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n_P._ 341, _l._ 392, _a derthe._--_l._ 403, _eft wele i-nouh._--_P._ 342,\r\n_l._ 409, _another sorwe._--_l._ 416, _another derthe of corn._--Our\r\npoem was probably composed in 1321. During the preceding years,\r\nthe kingdom had been visited repeatedly by dearth and famine.\r\nHolinshed remarks in 1316, a great dearth and famine, insomuch that\r\na quarter of wheat sold for forty shillings, and at the same time\r\na murrain among the cattle; in 1317, a “pitiful famine” with a\r\n“sore mortalitie of people;” the year 1318 seems to have been free\r\nfrom these visitations, and may have been that in which, according\r\nto the poem, there was “eft wele i-nouh;” in 1319, again, a great\r\nmurrain of cattle; and in the latter end of the following year and\r\nin 1321, broke out the “great variaunce betwixt the lords and the\r\nSpensers,” which was the cause of so much bloodshed, and which\r\nseems to be the “strif” (_l._ 423) under which the poet represents\r\nthe people as then labouring.\r\n\r\n_P._ 342, _l._ 418, _afingred._--For other instances of the use of this\r\nform, see a note on “The Tale of the Basyn and the Frere and the\r\nBoy.” (Pickering, 1836.)\r\n\r\n_P._ 344, _l._ 457, _paunter._--The true meaning of this word seems to\r\nbe a _trap_, or _snare_. An English prose treatise of counsel for\r\nhermits, probably by Hampole (MS. Trin. Coll. Cant. B. 15, 17, of\r\nthe reign of Edward III.), speaking of the snares laid by the devil\r\nto deceive people, observes, “This _panter_ leyeth owre enemy to\r\ntaken us with, whan we bigynne to haten wikkednesse, and turne us\r\nto goodnesse.”\r\n\r\n_P._ 345.--This poem is defective at the end, by the loss of the\r\nremainder of the MS., which is imperfect. The following curious\r\nSong, which was given me by Mr. Halliwell, bears a remarkable\r\nresemblance in some parts to the English poem of the Auchinleck MS.\r\nIt is taken from a MS. in the University Library, Cambridge, Ee.\r\nVI. 29, of the beginning of the fifteenth century, though most,\r\nif not all, the articles it contains are compositions of a much\r\nearlier date.\r\n\r\n        Ecce dolet Anglia luctibus imbuta!\r\n      Gens tremit tristitia, sordibus polluta;\r\n      Necat pestilentia viros atque bruta.\r\n      Cur? quia flagitia regnant resoluta.\r\n        Heu! jam totus vertitur mundus in malignum.\r\n      Inter gentes quæritur ubi cor benignum.\r\n      Christus non recolitur, mortuus per lignum;\r\n      Ergo plebs perimitur in vindictæ signum.\r\n        Pax et patientia penitus orbantur;\r\n      Amor et justitia domi non morantur;\r\n      Errores et vitia gentes amplexantur;\r\n      Patrum per malitia parvuli necantur.\r\n        Pastorum pigritia greges disperguntur;\r\n      Insontes astutia mercantum falluntur;\r\n      Fraus et avaritia sorores junguntur;\r\n      Divitum nequitia pauperes plectuntur.\r\n        Simonia colitur, Simon Magus vivit;\r\n      Æquitas opprimitur, veritas abivit;\r\n      Christi grex dispergitur, lupus insanivit;\r\n      Pestisque diffunditur, agnos deglutivit.\r\n        Favor non scientia permovet rectores;\r\n      Intrudit potentia servos ob labores,\r\n      Et regum clementia quosdam per favores;\r\n      Æs et amicitia juvant pervisores.\r\n        Fortes Christi milites modo recesserunt;\r\n      Sathanæ satellites templum subverterunt;\r\n      Laceras et debiles oves prodiderunt;\r\n      Cuculi degeneres nisis successerunt.\r\n        Patres quondam nobiles pestes fugarunt,\r\n      Et in fide stabiles languidos sanarunt;\r\n      Vita venerabiles signis coruscarunt;\r\n      Actus per laudabiles Christo militarunt.\r\n        Tales erunt vestibus asperis vestiti;\r\n      Ut moderni mollibus raro sunt potiti.\r\n      Hii præclaris moribus erant insigniti;\r\n      Juvenes a sordibus sacris eruditi.\r\n        Heu! nunc mercenarii, nec veri pastores,\r\n      Rectores, vicarii, mutaverunt mores;\r\n      Ambitu denarii subeunt labores;\r\n      Tales operarii merentur mœrores:\r\n        Isti pro ciliciis utuntur pellura;\r\n      Farciunt deliciis ventres tota cura;\r\n      Dant post[ea] spurcitiis se sine mensura;\r\n      Suffulti divitiis vivunt contra jura.\r\n        Dum capella tegitur nobili vestura,\r\n      Sponsa Christi rapitur nudata tectura;\r\n      Vinea destruitur porcorum ursura,\r\n      Et vitis evellitur, carens jam cultura.\r\n        Sacerdotes Domini sunt incontinentes;\r\n      Actus suo nomini non sunt respondentes;\r\n      Sacra dantes homini forent et docentes;\r\n      Sui mores ordini non sunt congruentes.\r\n        Ista super æthera sanguine scribantur,\r\n      Ut patenti littera sæculis legantur;\r\n      Ignibus cum vetera peccata purgantur,\r\n      Sua ferant onera jam qui dominantur.\r\n        En! amor et caritas regnis refrigescunt;\r\n      Livor et severitas gentibus ardescunt;\r\n      Cleri plebis veritas et fides tepescunt;\r\n      Hinc regni nobilitas et fama quiescunt.\r\n        Feminæ fragilitas omni caret laude;\r\n      Mercantum subtilitas versatur in fraude;\r\n      Et fratrum dolositas jungit caput caudæ.\r\n      Homo, si jam veritas te gubernat, gaude!\r\n                   _Explicit._\r\n\r\n\r\n_P._ 14. SONG ON THE TIMES.--Giraldus Cambrensis has inserted a\r\ncopy of this Song in the Speculum Ecclesiæ, MS. Cotton. Tiberius,\r\nB.
