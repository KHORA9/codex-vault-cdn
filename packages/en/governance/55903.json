(1)\r\n\r\n(Edinburgh Review, April, 1832.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe {1}work of Dr. Nares has filled us with astonishment similar\r\nto that which Captain Lemuel Gulliver felt when he first landed in\r\nBrobdingnag, and saw corn as high as the oaks in the New Forest,\r\nthimbles as large as buckets, and wrens of the bulk of turkeys. The\r\nwhole book, and every component part of it, is on a gigantic scale.\r\nThe title is as long as an ordinary preface: the prefatory matter would\r\nfurnish out an ordinary book; and the book contains as much reading as\r\nan ordinary library. We cannot sum up the merits of the stupendous mass\r\nof paper which lies before us better than by saying that it consists\r\nof about two thousand closely printed quarto pages, that it occupies\r\nfifteen hundred inches cubic measure, and\r\n\r\n     (1) _Memoirs of The Life and Administration of the Right\r\n     Honourable William Cecil Lord Burghley, Secretary of State in\r\n     the Reign of King Edward the Sixth, and Lord High Treasurer\r\n     of England in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. Containing an\r\n     Historical Mew of the Times in which he lived, and of the\r\n     many eminent and illustrious Persons with whom he was\r\n     connected; with Extracts from his Private and Official\r\n     Correspondence and other Papers, now first published from the\r\n     Originals_. By the Reverend Edward Nares, D. D., Regius\r\n     Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford. 3\r\n     vols. 4to. London: 1828. 1832.\r\n\r\n{2}that it weighs sixty pounds avoirdupois. Such a book might, before\r\nthe deluge, have been considered as light reading by Hilpa and Shalum.\r\nBut unhappily the life of man is now threescore years and ten; and we\r\ncannot but think it somewhat unfair in Dr. Nares to demand from us so\r\nlarge a portion of so short an existence.\r\n\r\nCompared with the labour of reading through these volumes, all\r\nother labour, the labour of thieves on the treadmill, of children in\r\nfactories, of negroes in sugar plantations, is an agreeable recreation.\r\nThere was, it is said, a criminal in Italy, who was suffered to make his\r\nchoice between Guicciardini and the galleys. He chose the history. But\r\nthe war of Pisa was too much for him. He changed his mind, and went to\r\nthe oar. Guicciardini, though certainly not the most amusing of writers,\r\nis a Herodotus or a Froissart, when compared with Dr. Nares. It is not\r\nmerely in bulk, but in specific gravity also, that these memoirs exceed\r\nall other human compositions. On every subject which the Professor\r\ndiscusses, he produces three times as many pages as another man; and one\r\nof his pages is as tedious as another man’s three. His book is swelled\r\nto its vast dimensions by endless repetitions, by episodes which have\r\nnothing to do with the main action, by quotations from books which are\r\nin every circulating library, and by reflections which, when they happen\r\nto be just, are so obvious that they must necessarily occur to the mind\r\nof every reader. He employs more words in expounding and defending a\r\ntruism than any other writer would employ in supporting a paradox. Of\r\nthe rules of historical perspective, he has not the faintest notion.\r\nThere is neither foreground nor background in his delineation. The wars\r\nof Charles {3}the Fifth in Germany are detailed at almost as much length\r\nas in Robertson’s life of that prince. The troubles of Scotland are\r\nrelated as fully as in M’Crie’s Life of John Knox. It would be most\r\nunjust to deny that Dr. Nares is a man of great industry and research;\r\nbut he is so utterly incompetent to arrange the materials which he\r\nhas collected that he might as well have left them in their original\r\nrepositories.\r\n\r\nNeither the facts which Dr. Nares has discovered, nor the arguments\r\nwhich he urges, will, we apprehend, materially alter the opinion\r\ngenerally entertained by judicious readers of history concerning his\r\nhero. Lord Burleigh can hardly be called a great man. He was not one\r\nof those whose genius and energy change the fate of empires. He was by\r\nnature and habit one of those who follow, not one of those who lead.\r\nNothing that is recorded, either of his words or of his actions,\r\nindicates intellectual or moral elevation. But his talents, though not\r\nbrilliant, were of an eminently useful kind; and his principles, though\r\nnot inflexible, were not more relaxed than those of his associates and\r\ncompetitors. He had a cool temper, a sound judgment, great powers of\r\napplication, and a constant eye to the main chance. In his youth,\r\nhe was, it seems, fond of practical jokes. Yet even out of these he\r\ncontrived to extract some pecuniary profit. When he was studying the law\r\nat Gray’s Inn, he lost all his furniture and books at the gaming table\r\nto one of his friends. He accordingly bored a hole in the wall which\r\nseparated his chambers from those of his associate, and at midnight\r\nbellowed through this passage threats of damnation and calls to\r\nrepentance in the ears of the victorious gambler, who lay sweating with\r\nfear all night, and refunded his winnings on his knees next day. “Many\r\n{4}other the like merry jests,” says his old biographer, “I have heard\r\nhim tell, too long to be here noted.” To the last, Burleigh was somewhat\r\njocose; and some of his sportive sayings have been recorded by Bacon.\r\nThey show much more shrewdness than generosity, and are, indeed, neatly\r\nexpressed reasons for exacting money rigorously, and for keeping it\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be acknowledged that he was rigorous and careful\r\nfor the public advantage as well as for his own. To extol his moral\r\ncharacter as Dr. Nares has extolled it is absurd. It would be equally\r\nabsurd to represent him as a corrupt, rapacious, and bad-hearted man. He\r\npaid great attention to the interests of the state, and great attention\r\nalso to the interest of his own family. He never deserted his friends\r\ntill it was very inconvenient to stand by them, was an excellent\r\nProtestant when it was not very advantageous to be a Papist, recommended\r\na tolerant policy to his mistress as strongly as he could recommend it\r\nwithout hazarding her favour, never put to the rack any person from whom\r\nit did not seem probable that useful information might be derived, and\r\nwas so moderate in his desires that he left only three hundred distinct\r\nlanded estates, though he might, as his honest servant assures us, have\r\nleft much more, “if he would have taken money out of the Exchequer for\r\nhis own use, as many Treasurers have done.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh, like the old Marquess of Winchester, who preceded him in the\r\ncustody of the White Staff, was of the willow, and not of the oak. He\r\nfirst rose into notice by defending the supremacy of Henry the Eighth.\r\nHe was subsequently favoured and promoted by the Duke of Somerset. He\r\nnot only contrived to escape unhurt when his patron fell, but became an\r\nimportant {5}member of the administration of Northumberland. Dr. Nares\r\nassures us over and over again that there could have been nothing base\r\nin Cecil’s conduct on this occasion; for, says he, Cecil continued to\r\nstand well with Cranmer. This, we confess, hardly satisfies us. We are\r\nmuch of the mind of Falstaff’s tailor. We must have better assurance for\r\nSir John than Bardolph’s. We like not the security.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole course of that miserable intrigue which was carried on\r\nround the dying bed of Edward the Sixth, Cecil so bemeaned himself as\r\nto avoid, first, the displeasure of Northumberland, and afterwards the\r\ndispleasure of Mary. He was prudently unwilling to put his hand to the\r\ninstrument which changed the course of the succession. But the furious\r\nDudley was master of the palace. Cecil, therefore, according to his own\r\naccount, excused himself from signing as a party, but consented to sign\r\nas a witness. It is not easy to describe his dexterous conduct at this\r\nmost perplexing crisis, in language more appropriate than that which is\r\nemployed by old Fuller. “His hand wrote it as secretary of state,” says\r\nthat quaint writer; “but his heart consented not thereto. Yea, he openly\r\nopposed it; though at last yielding to the greatness of Northumberland,\r\nin an age when it was present drowning not to swim with the stream. But\r\nas the philosopher tells us, that, though the planets be whirled about\r\ndaily from east to west, by the motion of the _primum mobile_, yet have\r\nthey also a contrary proper motion of their own from west to east, which\r\nthey slowly, though surely, move at their leisure; so Cecil had secret\r\ncounter-endeavours against the strain of the court herein, and privately\r\nadvanced his rightful intentions against the foresaid duke’s ambition.”\r\n {6}This was undoubtedly the most perilous conjuncture of Cecil’s life.\r\nWherever there was a safe course, he was safe. But here every course\r\nwas full of danger. His situation rendered it impossible for him to be\r\nneutral. If he acted on either side, if he refused to act at all, he ran\r\na fearful risk. He saw all the difficulties of his position. He sent\r\nhis money and plate out of London, made over his estates to his son, and\r\ncarried arms about his person. His best arms, however, were his sagacity\r\nand his self-command. The plot in which he had been an unwilling\r\naccomplice ended, as it was natural that so odious and absurd a plot\r\nshould end, in the ruin of its contrivers. In the mean time, Cecil\r\nquietly extricated himself, and, having been successively patronized by\r\nHenry, by Somerset, and by Northumberland, continued to flourish under\r\nthe protection of Mary.\r\n\r\nHe had no aspirations after the crown of martyrdom. He confessed\r\nhimself, therefore, with great decorum, heard mass in Wimbledon Church\r\nat Easter, and for the better ordering of his spiritual concerns, took\r\na priest into his house. Dr. Nares, whose simplicity passes that of any\r\ncasuist with whom we are acquainted, vindicates his hero by assuring us\r\nthat this was not superstition, but pure unmixed hypocrisy. “That he did\r\nin some manner conform, we shall not be able, in the face of existing\r\ndocuments, to deny; while we feel in our own minds abundantly satisfied,\r\nthat, during this very trying reign, he never abandoned the prospect of\r\nanother revolution in favour of Protestantism.” In another place,\r\nthe Doctor tells us, that Cecil went to mass “with no idolatrous\r\nintention.” Nobody, we believe, ever accused him of idolatrous\r\nintentions. The very ground of the charge against him is that he {7}had\r\nno idolatrous intentions. We never should have blamed him if he had\r\nreally gone to Wimbledon Church, with the feelings of a good Catholic,\r\nto worship the host. Dr. Nares speaks in several places with just\r\nseverity of the sophistry of the Jesuits, and with just admiration of\r\nthe incomparable letters of Pascal. It is somewhat strange, therefore,\r\nthat he should adopt, to the full extent, the jesuitical doctrine of the\r\ndirection of intentions.\r\n\r\nWe do not blame Cecil for not choosing to be burned. The deep stain upon\r\nhis memory is that, for differences of opinion for which he would risk\r\nnothing himself, he, in the day of his power, took away without scruple\r\nthe lives of others. One of the excuses suggested in these Memoirs for\r\nhis conforming, during the reign of Mary, to the Church of Rome, is that\r\nhe may have been of the same mind with those German Protestants who\r\nwere called Adiaphorists, and who considered the popish rites as\r\nmatters indifferent. Melancthon was one of these moderate persons,\r\nand “appears,” says Dr. Nares, “to have gone greater lengths than any\r\nimputed to Lord Burleigh.” We should have thought this not only an\r\nexcuse, but a complete vindication, if Cecil had been an Adiaphorist for\r\nthe benefit of others as well as for his own. If the popish rites\r\nwere matters of so little moment that a good Protestant might lawfully\r\npractise them for his safety, how could it be just or humane that a\r\nPapist should be hanged, drawn, and quartered, for practising them from\r\na sense of duty? Unhappily these non-essentials soon became matters\r\nof life and death. Just at the very time at which Cecil attained the\r\nhighest point of power and favour, an Act of Parliament was passed by\r\nwhich the penalties of high treason were denounced {8}against persons\r\nwho should do in sincerity what he had done from cowardice.\r\n\r\nEarly in the reign of Mary, Cecil was employed in a mission scarcely\r\nconsistent with the character of a zealous Protestant. He was sent to\r\nescort the Papal Legate, Cardinal Pole, from Brussels to London. That\r\ngreat body of moderate persons who cared more for the quiet of the\r\nrealm than for the controverted points which were in issue between the\r\nChurches seem to have placed their chief hope in the wisdom and humanity\r\nof the gentle Cardinal. Cecil, it is clear, cultivated the friendship\r\nof Pole with great assiduity, and received great advantage from the\r\nLegate’s protection.\r\n\r\nBut the best protection of Cecil, during the gloomy and disastrous reign\r\nof Mary, was that which he derived from his own prudence and from his\r\nown temper, a prudence which could never be lulled into carelessness,\r\na temper which could never be irritated into rashness The Papists could\r\nfind no occasion against him. Yet he did not lose the esteem even of\r\nthose sterner Protestants who had preferred exile to recantation. He\r\nattached himself to the persecuted heiress of the throne, and entitled\r\nhimself to her gratitude and confidence. Yet he continued to receive\r\nmarks of favour from the Queen. In the House of Commons, he put himself\r\nat the head of the party opposed to the Court. Yet, so guarded was\r\nhis language that, even when some of those who acted with him were\r\nimprisoned by the Privy Council, he escaped with impunity.\r\n\r\nAt length Mary died: Elizabeth succeeded; and Cecil rose at once to\r\ngreatness. He was sworn in Privy-councillor and Secretary of State\r\nto the new sovereign before he left her prison of Hatfield; and he\r\ncontinued to serve her during forty years, without {9}intermission, in\r\nthe highest employments. His abilities were precisely those which\r\nkeep men long in power. He belonged to the class of the Walpoles,\r\nthe Pelhams, and the Liverpools, not to that of the St. Johns, the\r\nCarterets, the Chathams, and the Cannings. If he had been a man of\r\noriginal genius and of an enterprising spirit, it would have been\r\nscarcely possible for him to keep his power or even his head. There was\r\nnot room in one government for an Elizabeth and a Richelieu. What the\r\nhaughty daughter of Henry needed, was a moderate, cautions, flexible\r\nminister, skilled in the details of business, competent to advise, but\r\nnot aspiring to command. And such a minister she found in Burleigh. No\r\narts could shake the confidence which she reposed in her old and trusty\r\nservant. The courtly graces of Leicester, the brilliant talents and\r\naccomplishments of Essex, touched the fancy, perhaps the heart, of the\r\nwoman; but no rival could deprive the Treasurer of the place which he\r\npossessed in the favour of the Queen. She sometimes chid him sharply;\r\nbut he was the man whom she delighted to honour. For Burleigh, she\r\nforgot her usual parsimony both of wealth and of dignities. For\r\nBurleigh, she relaxed that severe etiquette to which she was\r\nunreasonably attached. Every other person to whom she addressed her\r\nspeech, or on whom the glance of her eagle eye fell, instantly sank on\r\nhis knee. For Burleigh alone, a chair was set in her presence; and there\r\nthe old minister, by birth only a plain Lincolnshire esquire, took his\r\nease, while the haughty heirs of the Fitzalans and the De Veres humbled\r\nthemselves to the dust around him. At length, having survived all his\r\nearly coadjutors, and rivals, he died full of years and honours. His\r\nroyal mistress visited him on his {10}death-bed, and cheered him with\r\nassurances of her affection and esteem; and his power passed, with\r\nlittle diminution, to a son who inherited his abilities, and whose mind\r\nhad been formed by his counsels.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe life of Burleigh was commensurate with one of the most important\r\nperiods in the history of the world. It exactly measures the time during\r\nwhich the House of Austria held decided superiority and aspired to\r\nuniversal dominion. In the year in which Burleigh was born, Charles the\r\nFifth obtained the imperial crown. In the year in which Burleigh died,\r\nthe vast designs which had, during near a century, kept Europe in\r\nconstant agitation, were buried in the same grave with the proud and\r\nsullen Philip.\r\n\r\nThe life of Burleigh was commensurate also with the period during which\r\na great moral revolution was effected, a revolution the consequences of\r\nwhich were felt, not only in the cabinets of princes, but at half the\r\nfiresides in Christendom. He was born when the great religious schism\r\nwas just commencing. He lived to see that schism complete, and to see\r\na line of demarcation, which, since his death, has been very little\r\naltered, strongly drawn between Protestant and Catholic Europe.\r\n\r\nThe only event of modern times which can be properly compared with the\r\nReformation is the French Revolution, or, to speak more accurately, that\r\ngreat revolution of political feeling which took place in almost every\r\npart of the civilised world during the eighteenth century, and which\r\nobtained in France its most terrible and signal triumph. Each of these\r\nmemorable events may be described as a rising up of the human reason\r\nagainst a Caste. The one was a {11}straggle of the laity against the\r\nclergy for intellectual liberty; the other was a straggle of the people\r\nagainst princes and nobles for political liberty. In both cases, the\r\nspirit of innovation was at first encouraged by the class to which\r\nit was likely to be most prejudicial. It was under the patronage of\r\nFrederic, of Catherine, of Joseph, and of the grandees of France,\r\nthat the philosophy which afterwards threatened all the thrones and\r\naristocracies of Europe with destruction first became formidable. The\r\nardour with which men betook themselves to liberal studies, at the\r\nclose of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century, was\r\nzealously encouraged by the heads of that very church to which liberal\r\nstudies were destined to be fatal. In both cases, when the explosion\r\ncame, it came with a violence which appalled and disgusted many of those\r\nwho had previously been distinguished by the freedom of their opinions.\r\nThe violence of the democratic party in France made Burke a Tory and\r\nAlfieri a courtier. The violence of the chiefs of the German schism made\r\nErasmus a defender of abuses, and turned the author of Utopia into a\r\npersecutor. In both cases, the convulsion which had overthrown deeply\r\nseated errors, shook all the principles on which society rests to their\r\nvery foundations. The minds of men were unsettled. It seemed for a time\r\nthat all order and morality were about to perish with the prejudices\r\nwith which they had been long and intimately associated. Frightful\r\ncruelties were committed. Immense masses of property were confiscated.\r\nEvery part of Europe swarmed with exiles. In moody and turbulent spirits\r\nzeal soured into malignity, or foamed into madness. From the political\r\nagitation of the eighteenth century sprang the Jacobins. {12}From the\r\nreligious agitation of the sixteenth century sprang the Anabaptists. The\r\npartisans of Robespierre robbed and murdered in the name of fraternity\r\nand equality. The followers of Kniperdoling robbed and murdered in the\r\nname of Christian liberty. The feeling of patriotism was, in many parts\r\nof Europe, almost wholly extinguished. All the old maxims of foreign\r\npolicy were changed. Physical boundaries were superseded by moral\r\nboundaries. Nations made war on each other with new arms, with arms\r\nwhich no fortifications, however strong by nature or by art, could\r\nresist, with arms before which rivers parted like the Jordan, and\r\nramparts fell down like the walls of Jericho. The great masters of\r\nfleets and armies were often reduced to confess, like Milton’s warlike\r\nangel, how hard they found it\r\n\r\n                             “To exclude\r\n\r\n                   Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.”\r\n\r\nEurope was divided, as Greece had been divided during the period\r\nconcerning which Thucydides wrote. The conflict was not, as it is in\r\nordinary times, between state and state, but between two omnipresent\r\nfactions, each of which was in some places dominant and in other places\r\noppressed, but which, openly or covertly, carried on their strife in\r\nthe bosom of every society. No man asked whether another belonged to\r\nthe same country with himself, but whether he belonged to the same sect.\r\nParty-spirit seemed to justify and consecrate acts which, in any other\r\ntimes, would have been considered as the foulest of treasons. The French\r\nemigrant saw nothing disgraceful in bringing Austrian and Prussian\r\nhussars to Paris. The Irish or Italian democrat saw no impropriety in\r\nserving the French Directory against his own native government. {13}So,\r\nin the sixteenth century, the fury of theological factions suspended\r\nall national animosities and jealousies. The Spaniards were invited\r\ninto France by the League; the English were invited into France by the\r\nHuguenots.\r\n\r\nWe by no means intend to underrate or to palliate the crimes and\r\nexcesses which, during the last generation, were produced by the spirit\r\nof democracy. But, when we hear men zealous for the Protestant religion,\r\nconstantly represent the French Revolution as radically and essentially\r\nevil on account of those crimes and excesses, we cannot but remember\r\nthat the deliverance of our ancestors from the house of their spiritual\r\nbondage was effected “by plagues and by signs, by wonders and by war.”\r\n We cannot but remember that, as in the case of the French Revolution, so\r\nalso in the case of the Reformation, those who rose up against tyranny\r\nwere themselves deeply tainted with the vices which tyranny engenders.\r\nWe cannot but remember that libels scarcely less scandalous than those\r\nof Hebert, mummeries scarcely less absurd than those of Clootz, and\r\ncrimes scarcely less atrocious than those of Marat, disgrace the early\r\nhistory of Protestantism. The Reformation is an event long passed. That\r\nvolcano has spent its rage. The wide waste produced by its outbreak is\r\nforgotten. The landmarks which were swept away have been replaced. The\r\nruined edifices have been repaired. The lava has covered with a rich\r\nincrustation the fields which it once devastated, and, after having\r\nturned a beautiful and fruitful garden into a desert, has again turned\r\nthe desert into a still more beautiful and fruitful garden. The second\r\ngreat irruption is not yet over. The marks of its ravages are still\r\nall around us. The ashes are still hot beneath {14}our feet. In some\r\ndirections the deluge of fire still continues to spread. Yet experience\r\nsurely entitles us to believe, that this explosion, like that which\r\npreceded it, will fertilize the soil which it has devastated. Already,\r\nin those parts which have suffered most severely, rich cultivation and\r\nsecure dwellings have begun to appear amidst the waste. The more we read\r\nof the history of past ages, the more we observe the signs of our own\r\ntimes, the more do we feel our hearts filled and swelled up by a good\r\nhope for the future destinies of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Reformation in England is full of strange problems.\r\nThe most prominent and extraordinary phenomenon which it presents to\r\nus is the gigantic strength of the government contrasted with the\r\nfeebleness of the religious parties. During the twelve or thirteen years\r\nwhich followed the death of Henry the Eighth, the religion of the\r\nstate was thrice changed. Protestantism was established by Edward;\r\nthe Catholic Church was restored by Mary; Protestantism was again\r\nestablished by Elizabeth. The faith of the nation seemed to depend\r\non the personal inclinations of the sovereign. Nor was this all. An\r\nestablished church was then, as a matter of course, a persecuting\r\nchurch. Edward persecuted Catholics. Mary persecuted Protestants.\r\nElizabeth persecuted Catholics again. The father of those three\r\nsovereigns had enjoyed the pleasure of persecuting both sects at once,\r\nand had sent to death, on the same hurdle, the heretic who denied the\r\nreal presence, and the traitor who denied the royal supremacy. There\r\nwas nothing in England like that fierce and bloody opposition which,\r\nin France, each of the religious factions in its turn offered to the\r\ngovernment. We had neither a {15}Coligny nor a Mayenne, neither a\r\nMoncontour nor an Ivry. No English city braved sword and famine for\r\nthe reformed doctrines with the spirit of Rochelle, or for the Catholic\r\ndoctrines with the spirit of Paris. Neither sect in England formed a\r\nLeague. Neither sect extorted a recantation from the sovereign. Neither\r\nsect could obtain from an adverse sovereign even a toleration. The\r\nEnglish Protestants, after several years of domination, sank down with\r\nscarcely a straggle under the tyranny of Mary. The Catholics, after\r\nhaving regained and abused their old ascendency, submitted patiently to\r\nthe severe rule of Elizabeth. Neither Protestants nor Catholics engaged\r\nin any great and well organized scheme of resistance. A few wild and\r\ntumultuous risings, suppressed as soon as they appeared, a few dark\r\nconspiracies in which only a small number of desperate men engaged, such\r\nwere the utmost efforts made by these two parties to assert the most\r\nsacred of human rights, attacked by the most odious tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these circumstances which has generally been given is\r\nvery simple, but by no means satisfactory. The power of the crown, it is\r\nsaid, was then at its height, and was in fact despotic. This solution,\r\nwe own, seems to us to be no solution at all. It has long been the\r\nfashion, a fashion introduced by Mr. Hume, to describe the English\r\nmonarchy in the sixteenth century as an absolute monarchy. And such\r\nundoubtedly it appears to a superficial observer. Elizabeth, it is true,\r\noften spoke to her parliaments in language as haughty and imperious\r\nas that which the Great Turk would use to his divan. She punished with\r\ngreat severity members of the House of Commons who, in her opinion,\r\ncarried the freedom of debate too far. {16}She assumed the power of\r\nlegislating by means of proclamations. She imprisoned her subjects\r\nwithout bringing them to a legal trial. Torture was often employed,\r\nin defiance, of the laws of England, for the purpose of extorting\r\nconfessions from those who were shut up in her dungeons. The authority\r\nof the Star-Chamber and of the Ecclesiastical Commission was at its\r\nhighest point. Severe restraints were imposed on political and religious\r\ndiscussion. The number of presses was at one time limited. No man could\r\nprint without a license; and every work had to undergo the scrutiny\r\nof the Primate, or the Bishop of London. Persons whose writings were\r\ndispleasing to the court were cruelly mutilated, like Stubbs, or put\r\nto death, like Penry. Nonconformity was severely punished. The Queen\r\nprescribed the exact rule of religious faith and discipline; and whoever\r\ndeparted from that rule, either to the right or to the left, was in\r\ndanger of severe penalties.\r\n\r\nSuch was this government. Yet we know that it was loved by the great\r\nbody of those who lived under it. We know that, during the fierce\r\ncontests of the sixteenth century, both the hostile parties spoke of\r\nthe time of Elizabeth as of a golden age. That great Queen has now been\r\nlying two hundred and thirty years in Henry the Seventh’s chapel. Yet\r\nher memory is still dear to the hearts of a free people.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that the government of the Tudors was, with a\r\nfew occasional deviations, a popular government, under the forms\r\nof despotism. At first sight, it may seem that the prerogatives of\r\nElizabeth were not less ample than those of Lewis the Fourteenth, and\r\nher parliaments were as obsequious as his parliaments, that her warrant\r\nhad as much authority as {17}his _lettre-de-cachet_. The extravagance\r\nwith which her courtiers eulogized her personal and mental charms went\r\nbeyond the adulation of Boileau and Moliere. Lewis would have blushed\r\nto receive from those who composed the gorgeous circles of Marli and\r\nVersailles such outward marks of servitude as the haughty Britoness\r\nexacted of all who approached her. But the authority of Lewis rested on\r\nthe support of his army. The authority of Elizabeth rested solely on the\r\nsupport of her people. Those who say that her power was absolute do not\r\nsufficiently consider in what her power consisted. Her power consisted\r\nin the willing obedience of her subjects, in their attachment to her\r\nperson and to her office, in their respect for the old line from which\r\nshe sprang, in their sense of the general security which they enjoyed\r\nunder her government. These were the means, and the only means, which\r\nshe had at her command for carrying her decrees into execution, for\r\nresisting foreign enemies, and for crushing domestic treason. There was\r\nnot a ward in the city, there was not a hundred in any shire in England,\r\nwhich could not have overpowered the handful of armed men who composed\r\nher household. If a hostile sovereign threatened invasion, if an\r\nambitious noble raised the standard of revolt, she could have recourse\r\nonly to the trainbands of her capital and the array of her counties,\r\nto the citizens and yeomen of England, commanded by the merchants and\r\nesquires of England.\r\n\r\nThus, when intelligence arrived of the vast preparations which Philip\r\nwas making for the subjugation of the realm, the first person to whom\r\nthe government thought of applying for assistance was the Lord Mayor of\r\nLondon. They sent to ask him what force the city would engage to furnish\r\nfor the defence of the kingdom {18}against the Spaniards. The Mayor\r\nand Common Council, in return, desired to know what force the Queen’s\r\nHighness wished them to furnish. The answer was, fifteen ships and five\r\nthousand men. The Londoners deliberated on the matter, and, two days\r\nafter, “humbly entreated the council, in sign of their perfect love and\r\nloyalty to prince and country, to accept ten thousand men, and thirty\r\nships amply furnished.”\r\n\r\nPeople who could give such signs as these of their loyalty were by no\r\nmeans to be misgoverned with impunity. The English in the sixteenth\r\ncentury were, beyond all doubt, a free people. They had not, indeed, the\r\noutward show of freedom; but they had the reality. They had not as good\r\na constitution as we have; but thev had that without which the best\r\nconstitution is as useless as the king’s proclamation against vice and\r\nimmorality, that which, without any constitution, keeps rulers in awe,\r\nforce, and the spirit to use it. Parliaments, it is true, were rarely\r\nheld, and were not very respectfully treated. The great charter\r\nwas often violated. But the people had a security against gross and\r\nsystematic misgovernment, far stronger than all the parchment that was\r\never marked with the sign manual, and than all the wax that was ever\r\npressed by the great seal.\r\n\r\nIt is a common error in politics to confound means with ends.\r\nConstitutions, charters, petitions of right, declarations of right,\r\nrepresentative assemblies, electoral colleges, are not good governments;\r\nnor do they, even when most elaborately constructed, necessarily produce\r\ngood government. Laws exist in vain for those who have not the courage\r\nand the means to defend them. Electors meet in vain where want makes\r\nthem the {19}slaves of the landlord, or where superstition makes them\r\nthe slaves of the priest. Representative assemblies sit in vain unless\r\nthey have at their command, in the last resort, the physical power\r\nwhich is necessary to make their deliberations free, and their votes\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\nThe Irish are better represented in parliament than the Scotch, who\r\nindeed are not represented at all. (1) But are the Irish better governed\r\nthan the Scotch? Surely not. This circumstance has of late been used as\r\nan argument against reform. It proves nothing against reform. It proves\r\nonly this, that laws have no magical, no supernatural virtue; that\r\nlaws do not act like Aladdin’s lamp or Prince Ahmed’s apple; that\r\npriestcraft, that ignorance, that the rage of contending factions, may\r\nmake good institutions useless; that intelligence, sobriety, industry,\r\nmoral freedom, firm union, may supply in a great measure the defects of\r\nthe worst representative system. A people whose education and habits are\r\nsuch, that, in every quarter of the world, they rise above the mass of\r\nthose with whom they mix, as surely as oil rises to the top of water,\r\na people of such temper and self-government that the wildest popular\r\nexcesses recorded in their history partake of the gravity of judicial\r\nproceedings, and of the solemnity of religious rites, a people whose\r\nnational pride and mutual attachment have passed into a proverb, a\r\npeople whose high and fierce spirit, so forcibly described in\r\nthe haughty motto which encircles their thistle, preserved their\r\nindependence, during a straggle of centuries, from the encroachments of\r\nwealthier and more powerful neighbours, such a people cannot be\r\n\r\n     (1) It must be remembered that this was written before the\r\n     passing of the reform act.\r\n\r\n{20}long oppressed. Any government, however constituted, must respect\r\ntheir wishes and tremble at their discontents. It is indeed most\r\ndesirable that such a people should exercise a direct influence on\r\nthe conduct of affairs, and should make their wishes known through\r\nconstitutional organs. But some influence, direct or indirect, they will\r\nassuredly possess. Some organ, constitutional or unconstitutional,\r\nthey will assuredly find. They will be better governed under a good\r\nconstitution than under a bad constitution. But they will be better\r\ngoverned under the worst constitution than some other nations under the\r\nbest. In any general classification of constitutions, the constitution\r\nof Scotland must be reckoned as one of the worst, perhaps as the worst,\r\nin Christian Europe. Yet the Scotch are not ill governed, and the reason\r\nis simply that they will not bear to be ill governed.\r\n\r\nIn some of the oriental monarchies, in Afghanistan for example,\r\nthough there exists nothing which an European publicist would call a\r\nConstitution, the sovereign generally governs in conformity with certain\r\nrules established for the public benefit; and the sanction of those\r\nrules is, that every Afghan approves them, and that every Afghan is a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nThe monarchy of England in the sixteenth century was a monarchy of this\r\nkind. It is called an absolute monarchy, because little respect was paid\r\nby the Tudors to those institutions which we have been accustomed to\r\nconsider as the sole checks on the power of the sovereign. A modern\r\nEnglishman can hardly understand how the people can have had any real\r\nsecurity for good government under kings who levied benevolences, and\r\nchid the House of Commons as they would have chid a pack of dogs. People\r\ndo not sufficiently {21}consider that, though the legal checks were\r\nfeeble, the natural checks were strong. There was one great and\r\neffectual limitation on the royal authority, the knowledge that, if the\r\npatience of the nation were severely tried, the nation would put forth\r\nits strength, and that its strength would be found irresistible. If\r\na large body of Englishmen became thoroughly discontented, instead of\r\npresenting requisitions, holding large meetings, passing resolutions,\r\nsigning petitions, forming associations and unions, they rose up;\r\nthey took their halberds and their bows; and, if the sovereign was not\r\nsufficiently popular to find among his subjects other halberds and other\r\nbows to oppose to the rebels, nothing remained for him but a repetition\r\nof the horrible scenes of Berkeley and Pomfret. He had no regular army\r\nwhich could, by its superior arms and its superior skill, overawe\r\nor vanquish the sturdy Commons of his realm, abounding in the native\r\nhardihood of Englishmen, and trained in the simple discipline of the\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Tudors were as absolute as the Cæsars. Never\r\nwas parallel so unfortunate. The government of the Tudors was the direct\r\nopposite to the government of Augustus and his successors. The Cæsars\r\nruled despotically, by means of a great standing army, under the decent\r\nforms of a republican constitution. They called themselves citizens.\r\nThey mixed unceremoniously with other citizens. In theory they were only\r\nthe elective magistrates of a free commonwealth. Instead of arrogating\r\nto themselves despotic power, they acknowledged allegiance to the\r\nsenate. They were merely the lieutenants of that venerable body. They\r\nmixed in debate. They even appeared as advocates before the courts of\r\nlaw. Yet they could safely indulge in the wildest freaks of {22}cruelty\r\nand rapacity, while their legions remained faithful. Our Tudors, on the\r\nother hand, under the titles and forms of monarchical supremacy,\r\nwere essentially popular magistrates. They had no means of protecting\r\nthemselves against the public hatred; and they were therefore compelled\r\nto court the public favour. To enjoy all the state and all the personal\r\nindulgences of absolute power, to be adored with Oriental prostrations,\r\nto dispose at will of the liberty and even of the life of ministers and\r\ncourtiers, this the nation granted to the Tudors. But the condition on\r\nwhich they were suffered to be the tyrants of Whitehall was that they\r\nshould be the mild and paternal sovereigns of England. They were under\r\nthe same restraints with regard to their people under which a military\r\ndespot is placed with regard to his army. They would have found it as\r\ndangerous to grind their subjects with cruel taxation as Nero would\r\nhave found it to leave his prætorians unpaid. Those who immediately\r\nsurrounded the royal person, and engaged in the hazardous game of\r\nambition, were exposed to the most fearful dangers. Buckingham,\r\nCromwell, Surrey, Seymour of Sudeley, Somerset, Northumberland, Suffolk,\r\nNorfolk, Essex, perished on the scaffold. But in general the country\r\ngentleman hunted and the merchant traded in peace. Even Henry, as cruel\r\nas Domitian, but far more politic, contrived, while reeking; with the\r\nblood of the Lamiæ, to be a favourite with the cobblers.\r\n\r\nThe Tudors committed very tyrannical acts. But in their ordinary\r\ndealings with the people they were not, and could not safely be,\r\ntyrants. Some excesses were easily pardoned. For the nation was proud\r\nof the high and fiery blood of its magnificent princes, and {23}saw,\r\nin many proceedings which a lawyer would even then have condemned, the\r\noutbreak of the same noble spirit which so manfully hurled foul scorn\r\nat Parma and at Spain. But to this endurance there was a limit. If the\r\ngovernment ventured to adopt measures which the people really felt to be\r\noppressive, it was soon compelled to change its course. When Henry the\r\nEighth attempted to raise a forced loan of unusual amount by proceedings\r\nof unusual rigour, the opposition which he encountered was such as\r\nappalled even his stubborn and imperious spirit. The people, we are\r\ntold, said that, if they were treated thus, “then were it worse than the\r\ntaxes of France; and England should be bond, and not free.” The county\r\nof Suffolk rose in arms. The king prudently yielded to an opposition\r\nwhich, if he had persisted, would, in all probability, have taken\r\nthe form of a general rebellion. Towards the close of the reign of\r\nElizabeth, the people felt themselves aggrieved by the monopolies. The\r\nQueen, proud and courageous as she was, shrank from a contest with the\r\nnation, and, with admirable sagacity, conceded all that her subjects\r\nhad demanded, while it was yet in her power to concede’ with dignity and\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be imagined that a people who had in their own hands the means\r\nof checking their princes would suffer any prince to impose upon them a\r\nreligion generally detested. It is absurd to suppose that, if the nation\r\nhad been decidedly attached to the Protestant faith, Mary could have\r\nreestablished the Papal supremacy. It is equally absurd to suppose that,\r\nif the nation had been zealous for the ancient religion, Elizabeth could\r\nhave restored the Protestant Church. The truth is, that the people were\r\nnot disposed to engage in {24}a struggle either for the new or for the\r\nold doctrines. Abundance of spirit was shown when it seemed likely that\r\nMary would resume her father’s grants of church property, or that\r\nshe would sacrifice the interests of England to the husband whom she\r\nregarded with unmerited tenderness. That queen found that it would be\r\nmadness to attempt the restoration of the abbey lands. She found that\r\nher subjects would never suffer her to make her hereditary kingdom a\r\nfief of Castile. On these points she encountered a steady resistance,\r\nand was compelled to give way. If she was able to establish the Catholic\r\nworship and to persecute those who would not conform to it, it was\r\nevidently because the people cared far less for the Protestant religion\r\nthan for the rights of property and for the independence of the English\r\ncrown. In plain words, they did not think the difference between\r\nthe hostile sects worth a struggle. There was undoubtedly a zealous\r\nProtestant party and a zealous Catholic party. But both these parties\r\nwere, we believe, very small. We doubt, whether both together made\r\nup, at the time of Mary’s death, the twentieth part of the nation. The\r\nremaining nineteen twentieths halted between the two opinions, and were\r\nnot disposed to risk a revolution in the government, for the purpose of\r\ngiving to either of the extreme factions an advantage over the other.\r\n\r\nWe possess no data which will enable us to compare with exactness the\r\nforce of the two sects. Mr. Butler asserts that, even at the accession\r\nof James the First, a majority of the population of England were\r\nCatholics. This is pure assertion; and is not only unsupported by\r\nevidence, but, we think, completely disproved by the strongest evidence.\r\nDr. Lingard is of opinion that the Catholics were one half of the nation\r\nin the middle of {25}the reign of Elizabeth. Rushton says that, when\r\nElizabeth came to the throne, the Catholics were two thirds of the\r\nnation, and the Protestants only one third. The most judicious and\r\nimpartial of English historians, Mr. Hallam, is, on the contrary, of\r\nopinion, that two thirds were Protestants, and only one third Catholics.\r\nTo us, we must confess, it seems incredible that, if the Protestants\r\nwere really two to one, they should have borne the government of Mary,\r\nor that, if the Catholics were really two to one, they should have\r\nborne the government of Elizabeth. We are at a loss to conceive how a\r\nsovereign who has no standing army, and whose power rests solely on the\r\nloyalty of his subjects, can continue for years to persecute a religion\r\nto which the majority of his subjects are sincerely attached. In fact,\r\nthe Protestants did rise up against one sister, and the Catholics\r\nagainst the other. Those risings clearly showed how small and feeble\r\nboth the parties were. Both in the one case and in the other the nation\r\nranged itself on the side of the government, and the insurgents were\r\nspeedily put down and punished. The Kentish gentlemen who took up arms\r\nfor the reformed doctrines against Mary, and the great Northern Earls\r\nwho displayed the banner of the Five Wounds against Elizabeth, were\r\nalike considered by the great body of their countrymen as wicked\r\ndisturbers of the public peace.\r\n\r\nThe account which Cardinal Bentivoglio gave of the state of religion in\r\nEngland well deserves consideration. The zealous Catholics he reckoned\r\nat one thirtieth part of the nation. The people who would without\r\nthe least scruple become Catholics, if the Catholic religion were\r\nestablished, he estimated at four fifths of the nation. We believe this\r\naccount to have been very near the truth. We believe that the people,\r\n{26}whose minds were made up on either side, who were inclined to make\r\nany sacrifice or run any risk for either religion, were very few. Each\r\nside had a few enterprising champions, and a few stout-hearted martyrs;\r\nbut the nation, undetermined in its opinions and feelings, resigned\r\nitself implicitly to the guidance of the government, and lent to the\r\nsovereign for the time being an equally ready aid against either of the\r\nextreme parties.\r\n\r\nWe are very far from saying that the English of that generation were\r\nirreligious. They held firmly those doctrines which are common to the\r\nCatholic and to the Protestant theology. But they had no fixed opinion\r\nas to the matters in dispute between the churches. They were in a\r\nsituation resembling that of those Borderers whom Sir Walter Scott has\r\ndescribed with so much spirit,\r\n\r\n                   “Who sought the beeves that made their broth,\r\n\r\n                   In England and in Scotland both.”\r\n\r\nAnd who\r\n\r\n                   “Nine times outlawed had been\r\n\r\n                   By England’s king and Scotland’s queen.”\r\n\r\nThey were sometimes Protestants, sometimes Catholics; sometimes half\r\nProtestants half Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe English had not, for ages, been bigoted Papists. In the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the first and perhaps the greatest of the reformers, John\r\nWickliffe, had stirred the public mind to its inmost depths. During the\r\nsame century, a scandalous schism in the Catholic Church had diminished,\r\nin many parts of Europe, the reverence in which the Roman pontiffs were\r\nheld. It is clear that, a hundred years before the time of Luther, a\r\ngreat party in this kingdom was eager for a change at least as extensive\r\nas that which was subsequently {27}effected by Henry the Eighth.\r\nThe House of Commons, in the reign of Henry the Fourth, proposed a\r\nconfiscation of ecclesiastical property, more sweeping and violent even\r\nthan that which took place under the administration of Thomas Cromwell;\r\nand, though defeated in this attempt, they succeeded in depriving the\r\nclerical order of some of its most oppressive privileges. The splendid\r\nconquests of Henry the Fifth turned the attention of the nation from\r\ndomestic reform. The Council of Constance removed some of the grossest\r\nof those scandals which had deprived the Church of the public respect.\r\nThe authority of that venerable synod propped up the sinking authority\r\nof the Popedom. A considerable reaction took place. It cannot, however,\r\nbe doubted, that there was still some concealed Lollardism in England;\r\nor that many who did not absolutely dissent from any doctrine held by\r\nthe Church of Rome were jealous of the wealth and power enjoyed by her\r\nministers. At the very beginning of the reign of Henry the Eighth, a\r\nstruggle took place between the clergy and the courts of law, in which\r\nthe courts of law remained victorious. One of the bishops, on that\r\noccasion, declared that the common people entertained the strongest\r\nprejudices against his order, and that a clergyman had no chance of fair\r\nplay before a lay tribunal. The London juries, he said, entertained such\r\na spite to the Church that, if Abel were a priest, they would find him\r\nguilty of the murder of Cain. This was said a few months before the time\r\nwhen Martin Luther began to preach at Wittenburg against indulgences.\r\n\r\nAs the Reformation did not find the English bigoted Papists, so neither\r\nwas it conducted in such a manner as to make them zealous Protestants.\r\nIt was not under {28}the direction of men like that fiery Saxon who\r\nswore that he would go to Worms, though he had to face as many devils\r\nas there were tiles on the houses, or like that brave Switzer who was\r\nstruck down while praying in front of the ranks of Zurich. No preacher\r\nof religion had the same power here which Calvin had at Geneva and\r\nKnox in Scotland. The government put itself early at the head of the\r\nmovement, and thus acquired power to regulate, and occasionally to\r\narrest, the movement.\r\n\r\nTo many persons it appears extraordinary that Henry the Eighth should\r\nhave been able to maintain himself so long in an intermediate position\r\nbetween the Catholic and Protestant parties. Most extraordinary it would\r\nindeed be, if we were to suppose that the nation consisted of none but\r\ndecided Catholics and decided Protestants. The fact is that the great\r\nmass of the people was neither Catholic nor Protestant, but was, like\r\nits sovereign, midway between the two sects. Henry, in that very part\r\nof his conduct which has been represented as most capricious and\r\ninconsistent, was probably following a policy far more pleasing to the\r\nmajority of his subjects than a policy like that of Edward, or a policy\r\nlike that of Mary, would have been. Down even to the very close of the\r\nreign of Elizabeth, the people were in a state somewhat resembling that\r\nin which, as Machiavelli says, the inhabitants of the Roman empire were,\r\nduring the transition from heathenism to Christianity; “sendo la maggior\r\nparte di loro incerti a quale Dio dovessero ricorrere.” They were\r\ngenerally, we think, favourable to the royal supremacy. They disliked\r\nthe policy of the Court of Rome. Their spirit rose against the\r\ninterference of a foreign priest with their national concerns. The bull\r\n{29}which pronounced sentence of deposition against Elizabeth, the plots\r\nwhich were formed against her life, the usurpation of her titles by\r\nthe Queen of Scotland, the hostility of Philip, excited their strongest\r\nindignation. The cruelties of Bonner were remembered with disgust. Some\r\nparts of the new system, the use of the English language, for example,\r\nin public worship, and the communion in both kinds, were undoubtedly\r\npopular. On the other hand, the early lessons of the nurse and the\r\npriest were not forgotten. The ancient ceremonies were long remembered\r\nwith affectionate reverence. A large portion of the ancient theology\r\nlingered to the last in the minds which had been imbued with it in\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nThe best proof that the religion of the people was of this mixed kind\r\nis furnished by the Drama of that age. No man would bring unpopular\r\nopinions prominently forward in a play intended for representation. And\r\nwe may safely conclude, that feelings and opinions which pervade the\r\nwhole Dramatic Literature of a generation, are feelings and opinions of\r\nwhich the men of that generation generally partook.\r\n\r\nThe greatest and most popular dramatists of the Elizabethan age treat\r\nreligious subjects in a very remarkable manner. They speak respectfully\r\nof the fundamental doctrines of Christianity. But they speak neither\r\nlike Catholics nor like Protestants, but like persons who are wavering\r\nbetween the two systems, or who have made a system for themselves out of\r\nparts selected from both. They seem to hold some of the Romish rites and\r\ndoctrines in high respect. They treat the vow of celibacy, for example,\r\nso tempting, and, in later times, so common a subject for ribaldry, with\r\nmysterious reverence. Almost every member of a religious order {30}whom\r\nthey introduce is a holy and venerable man. We remember in their plays\r\nnothing resembling the coarse ridicule with which the Catholic religion\r\nand its ministers were assailed, two generations later, by dramatists,\r\nwho wished to please the multitude. We remember no Friar Dominic, no\r\nFather Foigard, among the characters drawn by those great poets. The\r\nscene at the close of the Knight of Malta might have been written by a\r\nfervent Catholic. Massinger show’s a great fondness for ecclesiastics of\r\nthe Romish Church, and has even gone so far as to bring a virtuous and\r\ninteresting Jesuit on the stage. Ford, in that fine play which it is\r\npainful to read and scarcely decent to name, assigns a highly creditable\r\npart to the Friar. The partiality of Shakspeare for Friars is well\r\nknown. In Hamlet, the Ghost complains that he died without extreme\r\nunction, and, in defiance of the article which condemns the doctrine of\r\npurgatory, declares that he is\r\n\r\n                             “Confined to fast in fires,\r\n\r\n                   Till the foul crimes, done in his days of nature,\r\n\r\n                   Are burnt and purged away.”\r\n\r\nThese lines, we suspect, would have raised a tremendous storm in the\r\ntheatre at any time during the reign of Charles the Second. They were\r\nclearly not written by a zealous Protestant, or for zealous Protestants.\r\nYet the author of King John and Henry the Eighth was surely no friend to\r\npapal supremacy.\r\n\r\nThere is, we think, only one solution of the phenomena which we find in\r\nthe history and in the drama of that age. The religion of the English\r\nwas a mixed religion, like that of the Samaritan settlers, described in\r\nthe second book of Kings, who “feared the Lord, and served their\r\ngraven images;” like that of the Judaizing Christians who blended the\r\nceremonies and {31}doctrines of the synagogue with those of the church;\r\nlike that of the Mexican Indians, who, during many generations after\r\nthe subjugation of their race, continued to unite with the rites learned\r\nfrom their conquerors the worship of the grotesque idols which had been\r\nadored by Montezuma and Guatemozin.\r\n\r\nThese feelings were not confined to the populace. Elizabeth herself was\r\nby no means exempt from them. A crucifix, with wax-lights burning round\r\nit, stood in her private chapel. She always spoke with disgust and anger\r\nof the marriage of priests. “I was in horror,” says Archbishop Parker,\r\n“to hear such words to come from her mild nature and Christian learned\r\nconscience, as she spake concerning God’s holy ordinance and institution\r\nof matrimony.” Burleigh prevailed on her to connive at the marriages of\r\nchurchmen. But she would only connive; and the children sprung from such\r\nmarriages were illegitimate till the accession of James the First.\r\n\r\nThat which is, as we have said, the great stain on the character of\r\nBurleigh is also the great stain on the character of Elizabeth. Being\r\nherself an Adiaphorist, having no scruple about conforming to the Romish\r\nChurch when conformity was necessary to her own safety, retaining to the\r\nlast moment of her life a fondness for much of the doctrine and much\r\nof the ceremonial of that church, she yet subjected that church to a\r\npersecution even more odious than the persecution with which her sister\r\nhad harassed the Protestants. We say more odious. For Mary had at least\r\nthe plea of fanaticism. She did nothing for her religion which she was\r\nnot prepared to suffer for it. She had held it firmly under persecution.\r\nShe fully believed it to be essential to salvation. If she burned the\r\nbodies of her {32}subjects, it was in order to rescue their souls.\r\nElizabeth had no such pretext. In opinion, she was little more than\r\nhalf a Protestant. She had professed, when it suited her, to be wholly\r\na Catholic. There is an excuse, a wretched excuse, for the massacres of\r\nPiedmont and the _Autos de fe_ of Spain. But what can be said in defence\r\nof a ruler who is at once indifferent and intolerant?\r\n\r\nIf the great Queen, whose memory is still held in just veneration by\r\nEnglishmen, had possessed sufficient virtue and sufficient enlargement\r\nof mind to adopt those principles which More, wiser in speculation than\r\nin action, had avowed in the preceding generation, and by which\r\nthe excellent L’Hospital regulated his conduct in her own time, how\r\ndifferent would be the colour of the whole history of the last\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years! She had the happiest opportunity ever\r\nvouchsafed to any sovereign of establishing perfect freedom of\r\nconscience throughout her dominions, without danger to her government,\r\nwithout scandal to any large party among her subjects. The nation, as it\r\nwas clearly ready to profess either religion, would, beyond all doubt,\r\nhave been ready to tolerate both. Unhappily for her own glory and for\r\nthe public peace, she adopted a policy from the effects of which the\r\nempire is still suffering. The yoke of the Established Church was\r\npressed down on the people till they would bear it no longer. Then\r\na reaction came. Another reaction followed. To the tyranny of the\r\nestablishment succeeded the tumultuous conflict of sects, infuriated\r\nby manifold wrongs, and drunk with unwonted freedom. To the conflict of\r\nsects succeeded again the cruel domination of one persecuting church.\r\nAt length oppression put off its most horrible form, and took a milder\r\n{33}aspect. The penal laws which had been framed for the protection of\r\nthe established church were abolished. But exclusions and disabilities\r\nstill remained. These exclusions and disabilities, after having\r\ngenerated the most fearful discontents, after having rendered all\r\ngovernment in one part of the kingdom impossible, after having brought\r\nthe state to the very brink of ruin, have, in our times, been removed,\r\nbut, though removed, have left behind them a rankling which may last\r\nfor many years. It is melancholy to think with what ease Elizabeth\r\nmight have united all conflicting sects under the shelter of the same\r\nimpartial laws and the same paternal throne, and thus have placed the\r\nnation in the same situation, as far as the rights of conscience are\r\nconcerned, in which we at last stand, after all the heart-burnings,\r\nthe persecutions, the conspiracies, the seditions, the revolutions, the\r\njudicial murders, the civil wars of ten generations.\r\n\r\nThis is the dark side of her character. Yet she surely was a great\r\nwoman. Of all the sovereigns who exercised a power which was seemingly\r\nabsolute, but which in fact depended for support on the love and\r\nconfidence of their subjects, she was by far the most illustrious.\r\nIt has often been alleged as an excuse for the misgovernment of her\r\nsuccessors that they only followed her example, that precedents might be\r\nfound in the transactions of her reign for persecuting the Puritans,\r\nfor levying money without the sanction of the House of Commons, for\r\nconfining men without bringing them to trial, for interfering with the\r\nliberty of parliamentary debate. All this may be true. But it is no good\r\nplea for her successors; and for this plain reason, that they were her\r\nsuccessors. She governed one generation, they governed another; and\r\nbetween {34}the two generations there was almost as little in common as\r\nbetween the people of two different countries. It was not by looking at\r\nthe particular measures which Elizabeth had adopted, but by looking at\r\nthe great general principles of her government, that those who followed\r\nher were likely to learn the art of managing untractable subjects. If,\r\ninstead of searching the records of her reign for precedents which\r\nmight seem to vindicate the mutilation of Prynne and the imprisonment of\r\nEliot, the Stuarts had attempted to discover the fundamental rules which\r\nguided her conduct in all her dealings with her people, they would have\r\nperceived that their policy was then most unlike to hers, when to a\r\nsuperficial observer it would have seemed most to resemble hers.\r\nFirm, haughty, sometimes unjust and cruel in her proceedings towards\r\nindividuals or towards small parties, she avoided with care, or\r\nretracted with speed, every measure which seemed likely to alienate the\r\ngreat mass of the people. She gained more honour and more love by the\r\nmanner in which she repaired her errors than she would have gained by\r\nnever committing errors. If such a man as Charles the First had been in\r\nher place when the whole nation was crying out against the monopolies,\r\nhe would have refused all redress. He would have dissolved the\r\nParliament, and imprisoned the most popular members. He would have\r\ncalled another Parliament. He would have given some vague and delusive\r\npromises of relief in return for subsidies. When entreated to fulfil\r\nhis promises, he would have again dissolved the Parliament, and again\r\nimprisoned his leading opponents. The country would have become more\r\nagitated than before. The next House of Commons would have been more\r\nunmanageable than {35}that which preceded it. The tyrant would have\r\nagreed to all that the nation demanded. He would have solemnly ratified\r\nan act abolishing monopolies forever. He would have received a large\r\nsupply in return for this concession; and within half a year new\r\npatents, more oppressive than those which had been cancelled, would have\r\nbeen issued by scores. Such was the policy which brought the heir of a\r\nlong line of kings, in early youth the darling of his countrymen, to a\r\nprison and a scaffold.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, before the House of Commons could address her, took out of\r\ntheir mouths the words which they were about to utter in the name of the\r\nnation. Her promises went beyond their desires. Her performance followed\r\nclose upon her promise. She did not treat the nation as an adverse\r\nparty, as a party which had an interest opposed to hers, as a party to\r\nwhich she was to grant as few advantages as possible, and from which she\r\nwas to extort as much money as possible. Her benefits were given, not\r\nsold; and, when once given, they were never withdrawn. She gave them too\r\nwith a frankness, an effusion of heart, a princely dignity, a motherly\r\ntenderness, which enhanced their value. They were received by the sturdy\r\ncountry gentlemen who had come up to Westminster full of resentment,\r\nwith tears of joy, and shouts of “God save the Queen.” Charles the\r\nFirst gave up half the prerogatives of his crown to the Commons; and the\r\nCommons sent him in return the Grand Remonstrance.\r\n\r\nWe had intended to say something concerning that illustrious group of\r\nwhich Elizabeth is the central figure, that group which the last of\r\nthe bards saw in vision from the top of Snowdon, encircling the Virgin\r\nQueen,\r\n\r\n                   “Many a baron bold,\r\n\r\n                   And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old\r\n\r\n                   In bearded majesty.”\r\n\r\n{36}We had intended to say something concerning the dexterous\r\nWalsingham, the impetuous Oxford, the graceful Sackville, the\r\nall-accomplished Sydney; concerning Essex, the ornament of the court\r\nand of the camp, the model of chivalry, the munificent patron of genius,\r\nwhom great virtues, great courage, great talents, the favour of his\r\nsovereign, the love of his countrymen, all that seemed to ensure a happy\r\nand glorious life, led to an early and an ignominious death; concerning\r\nRaleigh, the soldier, the sailor, the scholar, the courtier, the orator,\r\nthe poet, the historian, the philosopher, whom we picture to ourselves,\r\nsometimes reviewing the Queen’s guard, sometimes giving chase to a\r\nSpanish galleon, then answering the chiefs of the country party in the\r\nHouse of Commons, then again murmuring one of his sweet love-songs too\r\nnear the ears of her Highness’s maids of honour, and soon after pouring\r\nover the Talmud, or collating Polybins with Livy. We had intended also\r\nto say something concerning the literature of that splendid period, and\r\nespecially concerning those two incomparable men, the Prince of Poets,\r\nand the Prince of Philosophers, who have made the Elizabethan age a more\r\nglorious and important era in the history of the human mind than the\r\nage of Pericles, of Augustus, or of Loo. But subjects so vast require a\r\nspace far larger than we can at present afford. We therefore stop here,\r\nfearing that, if we proceed, our article may swell to a bulk exceeding\r\nthat of all other reviews, as much as Dr. Nares’s book exceeds the bulk\r\nof all other histories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRABEAU. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, July, 1832.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis {37}is a very amusing and a very instructive book; but, even if it\r\nwere less amusing and less instructive, it would still be interesting as\r\na relic of a wise and virtuous man. M. Dumont was one of those persons,\r\nthe care of whose fame belongs in an especial manner to mankind. For he\r\nwas one of those persons who have, for the sake of mankind, neglected\r\nthe care of their own fame. In his walk through life there was no\r\nobtrusiveness, no pushing, no elbowing, none of the little arts which\r\nbring forward little men. With every right to the head of the board, he\r\ntook the lowest room, and well deserved to be greeted with--Friend, go\r\nup higher. Though no man was more capable of achieving for himself\r\na separate and independent renown, he attached himself to others; he\r\nlaboured to raise their fame; he was content to receive as his share of\r\nthe reward the mere overflowings which redounded from the full measure\r\nof their glory. Not that he was of a servile and idolatrous habit of\r\nmind:--not that he was one of the tribe of Boswells,--those literary\r\nGibeonites, born to be hewers of wood and drawers of water to the\r\n\r\n     (1) _Souvenirs sur Mirabeau, et sur les deux Premieres\r\n     Assemblées Lêgislatives_. Par Etienne Dumont, de Genève:\r\n     ouvrage posthume publié par M. J. L. Duval, Membre du\r\n     Conseil Représentatif du Canton du Genève. 8vo. Paris: 1832.\r\n\r\n{38}higher intellectual castes. Possessed of talents and acquirements\r\nwhich made him great, he wished only to be useful. In the prime of\r\nmanhood, at the very time of life at which ambitious men are most\r\nambitious, he was not solicitous to proclaim that he furnished\r\ninformation, arguments, and eloquence to Mirabeau. In his later years\r\nhe was perfectly willing that his renown should merge in that of Mr.\r\nBentham.\r\n\r\nThe services which M. Dumont has rendered to society can be fully\r\nappreciated only by those who have studied Mr. Bentham’s works, both in\r\ntheir rude and in their finished state. The difference both for show and\r\nfor use is as great as the difference between a lump of golden ore and\r\na rouleau of sovereigns fresh from the mint. Of Mr. Bentham we would\r\nat all times speak with the reverence which is due to a great original\r\nthinker, and to a sincere and ardent friend of the human race. If a\r\nfew weaknesses were mingled with his eminent virtues,--if a few\r\nerrors insinuated themselves among the many valuable truths which he\r\ntaught,--this is assuredly no time for noticing those weaknesses or\r\nthose errors in an unkind or sarcastic spirit. A great man has gone from\r\namong us, full of years, of good works, and of deserved honours. In some\r\nof the highest departments in which the human intellect can exert\r\nitself he has not left his equal or his second behind him. From his\r\ncontemporaries he has had, according to the usual lot, more or less than\r\njustice. He has had blind flatterers and blind detractors--flatterers\r\nwho could see nothing but perfection in his style, detractors who\r\ncould see nothing but nonsense in his matter. He will now have judges.\r\nPosterity will pronounce its calm and impartial decision; and that\r\ndecision will, we firmly believe, place in the same rank {39}with\r\nGalileo, and with Locke, the man who found jurisprudence a gibberish and\r\nleft it a science. Never was there a literary partnership so fortunate\r\nas that of Mr. Bentham and M. Dumont. The raw material which Mr. Bentham\r\nfurnished was most precious; but it was unmarketable. He was, assuredly,\r\nat once a great logician and a great rhetorician. But the effect of\r\nhis logic was injured by a vicious arrangement, and the effect or his\r\nrhetoric by a vicious style. His mind was vigorous, comprehensive,\r\nsubtle, fertile of arguments, fertile of illustrations. But he spoke in\r\nan unknown tongue; and, that the congregation might be edified, it was\r\nnecessary that some brother having the gift of interpretation should\r\nexpound the invaluable jargon. His oracles were of high import; but they\r\nwere traced on leaves and flung loose to the wind. So negligent was he\r\nof the arts of selection, distribution, and compression, that to persons\r\nwho formed their judgment of him from his works in their undigested\r\nstate he seemed to be the least systematic of all philosophers. The\r\ntruth is, that his opinions formed a system, which, whether sound or\r\nunsound, is more exact, more entire, and more consistent with itself\r\nthan any other. Yet to superficial readers of his works in their\r\noriginal form, and indeed to all readers of those works who did not\r\nbring great industry and great acuteness to the study, he seemed to be a\r\nman of a quick and ingenious but ill-regulated mind,--who saw truth\r\nonly by glimpses,--who threw out many striking hints, but who had never\r\nthought of combining his doctrines in one harmonious whole.\r\n\r\nM. Dumont was admirably qualified to supply what was wanting in Mr.\r\nBentham. In the qualities in which the French writers surpass those\r\nof all other nations,--{40}neatness, clearness, precision,\r\ncondensation,--he surpassed all French writers. If M. Dumont had never\r\nbeen horn, Mr. Bentham would still have been a very great man. But he\r\nwould have been great to himself alone. The fertility of his mind would\r\nhave resembled the fertility of those vast American wildernesses in\r\nwhich blossoms and decays a rich but unprofitable vegetation, “wherewith\r\nthe reaper filleth not his hand, neither he that bindeth up the sheaves\r\nhis bosom.” It would have been with his discoveries as it has been with\r\nthe “Century of Inventions.” His speculations on laws would have been\r\nof no more practical use than Lord Worcester’s speculations on\r\nsteam-engines. Some generations hence, perhaps, when legislation had\r\nfound its Watt, an antiquarian might have published to the world the\r\ncurious fact, that, in the reign of George the Third, there had been a\r\nman called Bentham, who had given hints of many discoveries made since\r\nhis time, and who had really, for his age, taken a most philosophical\r\nview of the principles of jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nMany persons have attempted to interpret between this powerful mind and\r\nthe public. But, in our opinion, M. Dumont alone has succeeded. It is\r\nremarkable that, in foreign countries, where Mr. Bentham’s works are\r\nknown solely through the medium of the French version, his merit is\r\nalmost universally acknowledged. Even those who are most decidedly\r\nopposed to his political opinions--the very chiefs of the Holy\r\nAlliance--have publicly testified their respect for him. In England,\r\non the contrary, many persons who certainly entertained no prejudice\r\nagainst him on political grounds were long in the habit of mentioning\r\nhim contemptuously. Indeed, what was said {41}of Bacon’s Philosophy may\r\nbe said of Bentham’s. It was in little repute among us, till judgments\r\nin its favour came from beyond sea, and convinced us, to our shame, that\r\nwe had been abusing and laughing at one of the greatest men of the age.\r\n\r\nM. Dumont might easily have found employments more gratifying to\r\npersonal vanity than that of arranging works not his own. But he could\r\nhave found no employment more useful or more truly honourable. The book\r\nbefore us, hastily written as it is, contains abundant proof, if proof\r\nwere needed, that he did not become an editor because he wanted the\r\ntalents which would have made him eminent as a writer.\r\n\r\nPersons who hold democratical opinions, and who have been accustomed\r\nto consider M. Dumont as one of their party, have been surprised and\r\nmortified to learn that he speaks with very little respect of the\r\nFrench Revolution and of its authors. Some zealous Tories have naturally\r\nexpressed great satisfaction at finding their doctrines, in some\r\nrespects, confirmed by the testimony of an unwilling witness. The date\r\nof the work, we think, explains every thing. If it had been written ten\r\nyears earlier, or twenty years later, it would have been very different\r\nfrom what it is. It was written, neither during the first excitement\r\nof the Revolution, nor at that later period when the practical good\r\nproduced by the Revolution had become manifest to the most prejudiced\r\nobservers; but in those wretched times when the enthusiasm had abated,\r\nand the solid advantages were not yet fully seen. It was written in the\r\nyear 1799,--a year in which the most sanguine friend of liberty might\r\nwell feel some misgivings as to the effects of what the National\r\nAssembly had done. The evils which attend every great change had been\r\n{42}severely felt. The benefit was still to come. The price--a heavy\r\nprice--had been paid. The thing purchased had not yet been delivered.\r\nEurope was swarming with French exiles. The fleets and armies of the\r\nsecond coalition were victorious. Within France, the reign of terror was\r\nover; but the reign of law had not commenced. There had been, indeed,\r\nduring three or four years, a written Constitution, by which rights\r\nwere defined and checks provided. But these rights had been repeatedly\r\nviolated; and those checks had proved utterly inefficient. The laws\r\nwhich had been framed to secure the distinct authority of the\r\nexecutive magistrates and of the legislative assemblies--the freedom of\r\nelection--the freedom of debate--the freedom of the press--the personal\r\nfreedom of citizens--were a dead letter. The ordinary mode in which\r\nthe Republic was governed was by _coups d’état_. On one occasion,\r\nthe legislative councils were placed under military restraint by the\r\ndirectors. Then, again, directors were deposed by the legislative\r\ncouncils. Elections were set aside by the executive authority. Shiploads\r\nof writers and speakers were sent, without a legal trial, to die\r\nof fever in Guiana. France, in short, was in that state in which\r\nrevolutions, effected by violence, almost always leave a nation. The\r\nhabit of obedience had been lost. The spell of prescription had been\r\nbroken. Those associations on which, far more than on any arguments\r\nabout property and order, the authority of magistrates rests had\r\ncompletely passed away. The power of the government consisted merely in\r\nthe physical force which it could bring to its support. Moral force it\r\nhad none. It was itself a government sprung from a recent convulsion.\r\nIts own fundamental maxim was, that rebellion might be justifiable.\r\n{43}Its own existence proved that rebellion might be successful. The\r\npeople had been accustomed, during several years, to offer resistance to\r\nthe constituted authorities on the slightest provocation, and to see the\r\nconstituted authorities yield to that resistance. The whole political\r\nworld was “without form and void”--an incessant whirl of hostile atoms,\r\nwhich, every moment, formed some new combination. The only man who could\r\nfix the agitated elements of society in a stable form was following a\r\nwild vision of glory and empire through the Syrian deserts. The time was\r\nnot yet come, when\r\n\r\n                   “Confusion heard his voice; and wild uproar\r\n\r\n                   Stood ruled:”\r\n\r\nwhen, out of the chaos into which the old society had been resolved,\r\nwere to rise a new dynasty, a new peerage, a new church, and a new code.\r\n\r\nThe dying words of Madame Roland, “Oh Liberty! how many crimes are\r\ncommitted in thy name!” were at that time echoed by many of the\r\nmost upright and benevolent of mankind. M. Guizot has, in one of his\r\nadmirable pamphlets, happily and justly described M. Laine as “an honest\r\nand liberal man discouraged by the Revolution.” This description, at the\r\ntime when M. Dumont’s Memoirs were written, would have applied to almost\r\nevery honest and liberal man in Europe; and would, beyond all doubt,\r\nhave applied to M. Dumont himself. To that fanatical worship of the\r\nall-wise and all-good people, which had been common a few years before,\r\nhad succeeded an uneasy suspicion that the follies and vices of the\r\npeople would frustrate all attempts to serve them. The wild and joyous\r\nexultation with which the meeting of the States-General {44}and the\r\nfall of the Bastile had been hailed, had passed away. In its place\r\nwas dejection, and a gloomy distrust of specious appearances. The\r\nphilosophers and philanthropists had reigned. And what had their reign\r\nproduced? Philosophy had brought with it mummeries as absurd as any\r\nwhich had been practised by the most superstitious zealot of the darkest\r\nage. Philanthropy had brought with it crimes as horrible as the massacre\r\nof St. Bartholomew. This was the emancipation of the human mind. These\r\nwere the fruits of the great victory of reason over prejudice. France\r\nhad rejected the faith of Pascal and Descartes as a nursery fable, that\r\na courtezan might be her idol, and a madman her priest. She had asserted\r\nher freedom against Louis, that she might bow down before Robespierre.\r\nFor a time men thought that all the boasted wisdom of the eighteenth\r\ncentury was folly: and that those hopes of great political and social\r\nameliorations which had been cherished by Voltaire and Condorcet were\r\nutterly delusive.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these feelings, M. Dumont has gone so far as\r\nto say that the writings of Mr. Burke on the French Revolution, though\r\ndisfigured by exaggeration, and though containing doctrines subversive\r\nof all public liberty, had been, on the whole, justified by events, and\r\nhad probably saved Europe from great disasters. That such a man as the\r\nfriend and fellow-labourer of Mr. Bentham should have expressed such\r\nan opinion is a circumstance which well deserves the consideration of\r\nuncharitable politicians. These Memoirs have not convinced us that the\r\nFrench Revolution was not a great blessing to mankind. But they have\r\nconvinced us that very great indulgence is due to those who, while\r\nthe Revolution was actually {45}taking place, regarded it with unmixed\r\naversion and horror. We can perceive where their error lay. We can\r\nperceive that the evil was temporary, and the good durable. But we\r\ncannot be sure that, if our lot had been cast in their times, we should\r\nnot, like them, have been discouraged and disgusted--that we should not,\r\nlike them, have seen, in that great victory of the French people, only\r\ninsanity and crime.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how some men are applauded, and others reviled,\r\nfor merely being what all their neighbours are,--for merely going\r\npassively down the stream of events,--for merely representing the\r\nopinions and passions of a whole generation. The friends of popular\r\ngovernment ordinarily speak with extreme severity of Mr. Pitt, and with\r\nrespect and tenderness of Mr. Canning. Yet the whole difference, we\r\nsuspect, consisted merely in this,--that Mr. Pitt died in 1806, and Mr.\r\nCanning in 1827. During the years which were common to the public life\r\nof both, Mr. Canning was assuredly not a more liberal statesman than his\r\npatron. The truth is, that Mr. Pitt began his political life at the end\r\nof the American War, when the nation was suffering from the effects of\r\ncorruption. He closed it in the midst of the calamities produced by the\r\nFrench Revolution, when the nation was still strongly impressed with the\r\nhorrors of anarchy. He changed, undoubtedly. In his youth he had brought\r\nin reform bills. In his manhood he brought in gagging bills. But the\r\nchange, though lamentable, was, in our opinion, perfectly natural, and\r\nmight have been perfectly honest. He changed with the great body of his\r\ncountrymen. Mr. Canning, on the other hand, entered into public life\r\nwhen Europe was in dread of the Jacobins. He closed his public life when\r\nEurope was suffering under {46}the tyranny of the Holy Alliance. He,\r\ntoo, changed with the nation. As the crimes of the Jacobins had turned\r\nthe master into something very like a Tory, the events which followed\r\nthe Congress of Vienna turned the pupil into something very like a Whig.\r\n\r\nSo much are men the creatures of circumstances. We see that, if M.\r\nDumont had died in 1799, he would have died, to use the new cant word,\r\na decided “Conservative.” If Mr. Pitt had lived in 1832, it is our firm\r\nbelief that he would have been a decided Reformer.\r\n\r\nThe judgment passed by M. Dumont in this work on the French Revolution\r\nmust be taken with considerable allowances. It resembles a criticism on\r\na play of which only the first act has been performed, or on a building\r\nfrom which the scaffolding has not yet been taken down. We have no doubt\r\nthat, if the excellent author had revised these memoirs thirty years\r\nafter the time at which they were written, he would have seen reason to\r\nomit a few passages, and to add many qualifications and explanations.\r\n\r\nHe would not probably have been inclined to retract the censures, just,\r\nthough severe, which he has passed on the ignorance, the presumption,\r\nand the pedantry, of the National Assembly. But he would have admitted\r\nthat, in spite of those faults, perhaps even by reason of those faults,\r\nthat Assembly had conferred inestimable benefits on mankind. It is clear\r\nthat, among the French of that day, political knowledge was absolutely\r\nin its infancy. It would indeed have been strange if it had attained\r\nmaturity in the time of censors, of _lettres-de-cachet_, and of beds of\r\njustice. The electors did not know how to elect. The representatives\r\ndid not know how to deliberate. M. Dumont taught the constituent body\r\nof Montreuil how to perform their functions, and {47}found them apt to\r\nlearn. He afterwards tried, in concert with Mirabeau, to instruct the\r\nNational Assembly in that admirable system of Parliamentary tactics\r\nwhich has been long established in the English House of Commons, and\r\nwhich has made the House of Commons, in spite of all the defects in its\r\ncomposition, the best and fairest debating society in the world. But\r\nthese accomplished legislators, though quite as ignorant as the mob of\r\nMontreuil, proved much less docile, and cried out that they did not\r\nwant to go to school to the English. Their debates consisted of endless\r\nsuccessions of trashy pamphlets, all beginning with something about the\r\noriginal compact of society, man in the hunting state, and other such\r\nfoolery. They sometimes diversified and enlivened these long readings by\r\na little rioting. They bawled; they hooted; they shook their fists. They\r\nkept no order among themselves. They were insulted with impunity by\r\nthe crowd which filled their galleries. They gave long and solemn\r\nconsiderations to trifles. They hurried through the most important\r\nresolutions with fearful expedition. They wasted months in quibbling\r\nabout the words of that false and childish Declaration of Rights on\r\nwhich they professed to found their new constitution, and which was at\r\nirreconcilable variance with every clause of that constitution. They\r\nannihilated in a single night privileges, many of which partook of the\r\nnature of property, and ought therefore to have been most delicately\r\nhandled.\r\n\r\nThey are called the Constituent Assembly. Never was a name less\r\nappropriate. They were not constituent, but the very reverse of\r\nconstituent. They constituted nothing that stood or that deserved to\r\nlast. They had not, and they could not possibly have, the information or\r\nthe habits of mind which are necessary {48}for the framing of that most\r\nexquisite of all machines--a government. The metaphysical cant with\r\nwhich they prefaced their constitution has long been the scoff of\r\nall parties. Their constitution itself,--that constitution which\r\nthey described as absolutely perfect, and to which they predicted\r\nimmortality,--disappeared in a few months, and left no trace behind it.\r\nThey were great only in the work of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the National Assembly is this, that they were in truth,\r\nwhat Mr. Burke called them in austere irony, the ablest architects of\r\nruin that ever the world saw. They were utterly incompetent to perform\r\nany work which required a discriminating eye and a skilful hand. But the\r\nwork which was then to be done was a work of devastation. They had\r\nto deal with abuses so horrible and so deeply rooted that the highest\r\npolitical wisdom could scarcely have produced greater good to mankind\r\nthan was produced by their fierce and senseless temerity. Demolition\r\nis undoubtedly a vulgar task; the highest glory of the statesman is to\r\nconstruct. But there is a time for every thing,--a time to set up, and a\r\ntime to pull down. The talents of revolutionary leaders and those of the\r\nlegislator have equally their use and their season. It is the\r\nnatural, the almost universal, law, that the age of insurrections, and\r\nproscriptions shall precede the age of good government, of temperate\r\nliberty, and liberal order.\r\n\r\nAnd how should it be otherwise? It is not in swaddling-bands that\r\nwe learn to walk. It is not in the dark that we learn to distinguish\r\ncolours. It is not under oppression that we learn how to use freedom.\r\nThe ordinary sophism by which misrule is defended is, when truly stated,\r\nthis:--The people must continue {49}in slavery, because slavery has\r\ngenerated in them all the vices of slaves. Because they are ignorant,\r\nthey must remain under a power which has made and which keeps them\r\nignorant. Because they have been made ferocious by misgovernment, they\r\nmust be misgoverned for ever. If the system under which they live were\r\nso mild and liberal that under its operation they had become humane\r\nand enlightened, it would be safe to venture on a change. But, as this\r\nsystem has destroyed morality, and prevented the development of the\r\nintellect,--as it has turned men, who might under different training\r\nhave formed a virtuous and happy community, into savage and stupid wild\r\nbeasts,--therefore it ought to last for ever. The English Revolution,\r\nit is said, was truly a glorious Revolution. Practical evils were\r\nredressed; no excesses were committed; no sweeping confiscations took\r\nplace; the authority of the laws was scarcely for a moment suspended;\r\nthe fullest and freest discussion was tolerated in Parliament; the\r\nnation showed, by the calm and temperate manner in which it asserted its\r\nliberty, that it was fit to enjoy liberty. The French Revolution was,\r\non the other hand, the most horrible event recorded in history,--all\r\nmadness and wickedness,--absurdity in theory, and atrocity in practice.\r\nWhat folly and injustice in the revolutionary laws! What grotesque\r\naffectation in the revolutionary ceremonies! What fanaticism! What\r\nlicentiousness! What cruelty! Anacharsis Clootz and Marat,--feasts of\r\nthe Supreme Being, and marriages of the Loire--trees of liberty, and\r\nheads dancing on pikes--the whole forms a kind of infernal farce, made\r\nup of every thing ridiculous, and every thing frightful. This it is to\r\ngive freedom to those who have neither wisdom nor virtue. {50}It is not\r\nonly by bad men interested in the defence of abuses that arguments like\r\nthese have been urged against all schemes of political improvement.\r\nSome of the highest and purest of human beings conceived such scorn and\r\naversion for the follies and crimes of the French Revolution that they\r\nrecanted, in the moment of triumph, those liberal opinions to which they\r\nhad clung in defiance of persecution. And, if we inquire why it was that\r\nthey began to doubt whether liberty were a blessing, we shall find that\r\nit was only because events had proved, in the clearest manner, that\r\nliberty is the parent of virtue and of order. They ceased to abhor\r\ntyranny merely because it had been signally shown that the effect of\r\ntyranny on the hearts and understandings of men is more demoralising and\r\nmore stupifying than had ever been imagined by the most zealous friend\r\nof moral rights. The truth is, that a stronger argument against the old\r\nmonarchy of France maybe drawn from the _noyades_ and the _fusillades_\r\nthan from the Bastile and the _Parc-aux-cerfs_. We believe it to be a\r\nrule without an exception, that the violence of a revolution corresponds\r\nto the degree of misgovernment which has produced that revolution.\r\nWhy was the French Revolution so bloody and destructive? Why was our\r\nrevolution of 1641 comparatively mild? Why was our revolution of 1688\r\nmilder still? Why was the American Revolution, considered as an internal\r\nmovement, the mildest of all? There is an obvious and complete solution\r\nof the problem. The English under James the First and Charles the First\r\nwere less oppressed than the French under Louis the Fifteenth and Louis\r\nthe Sixteenth. The English were less oppressed after the Restoration\r\nthan before the great Rebellion. And America under George the Third was\r\nless oppressed than England under the Stuarts. The re-action {51}was\r\nexactly proportioned to the pressure,--the vengeance to the provocation.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Burke was reminded in his later years of the zeal which he had\r\ndisplayed in the cause of the Americans, he vindicated himself from the\r\ncharge of inconsistency, by contrasting the wisdom and moderation of the\r\nColonial insurgents of 1776 with the fanaticism and wickedness of the\r\nJacobins of 1792. He was in fact bringing an argument _a fortiori_\r\nagainst himself. The circumstances on which he rested his vindication,\r\nfully proved that the old government of France stood in far more need\r\nof a complete change than the old government of America. The difference\r\nbetween Washington and Robespierre,--the difference between Franklin and\r\nBarere,--the difference between the destruction of a few barrels of\r\ntea and the confiscation of thousands of square, miles,--the difference\r\nbetween the tarring and feathering of a tax-gatherer and the massacres\r\nof September,--measure the difference between the government of America\r\nunder the rule of England and the government of France under the rule of\r\nthe Bourbons.\r\n\r\nLouis the Sixteenth made great voluntary concessions to his people;\r\nand they sent him to the scaffold. Charles the Tenth violated the\r\nfundamental laws of the state, established a despotism, and butchered\r\nhis subjects for not submitting quietly to that despotism. He failed in\r\nhis wicked attempt. He was at the mercy of those whom he had injured.\r\nThe pavements of Paris were still heaped up in barricades;--the\r\nhospitals were still full of the wounded;--the dead were still\r\nunburied;--a thousand families were in mourning;--a hundred thousand\r\ncitizens were in arms. The crime was recent;--the life of the criminal\r\nwas in the hands {52}of the sufferers;--and they touched not one hair of\r\nhis head. In the first, revolution, victims were sent to death by scores\r\nfor the most trifling acts proved by the lowest testimony, before the\r\nmost partial tribunals. After the second revolution, those ministers who\r\nhad signed the ordinances,--those ministers, whose guilt, as it was of\r\nthe foulest kind, was proved by the clearest evidence,--were punished\r\nonly with imprisonment. In the first revolution, property was attacked.\r\nIn the second, it was held sacred. Both revolutions, it is true, left\r\nthe public mind of France in an unsettled state. Both revolutions were\r\nfollowed by insurrectionary movements. But, after the first revolution,\r\nthe insurgents were almost always stronger than the law; and, since the\r\nsecond revolution, the law has invariably been found stronger than the\r\ninsurgents. There is, indeed, much in the present state of France which\r\nmay well excite the uneasiness of those who desire to see her free,\r\nhappy, powerful, and secure. Yet, if we compare the present state of\r\nFrance with the state in which she was forty years ago, how vast a\r\nchange for the better has taken place! How little effect, for example,\r\nduring the first revolution, would the sentence of a judicial body have\r\nproduced on an armed and victorious body! If, after the 10th of August,\r\nor after the proscription of the Gironde, or after the 9th of Thermidor,\r\nor after the carnage of Vendémiaire, or after the arrests of Fructidor,\r\nany tribunal had decided against the conquerors in favour of the\r\nconquered, with what contempt, with what derision, would its award have\r\nbeen received! The judges would have lost their heads, or would have\r\nbeen sent to die in some unwholesome colony. The fate of the victim whom\r\nthey had endeavoured to save would only have been made darker and more\r\nhopeless {53}by their interference. We have lately seen a signal proof\r\nthat, in France, the law is now stronger than the sword. We have seen a\r\ngovernment, in the very moment of triumph and revenge, submitting itself\r\nto the authority of a court of law. A just and independent sentence\r\nhas been pronounced--a sentence worthy of the ancient renown of\r\nthat magistracy to which belong the noblest recollections of French\r\nhistory--which, in an age of persecutors, produced L’Hôpital,--which,\r\nin an age of courtiers, produced D’Aguesseau--which, in an age of\r\nwickedness and madness, exhibited to mankind a pattern of every virtue\r\nin the life and in the death of Malesherbes. The respectful manner in\r\nwhich that sentence has been received is alone sufficient to show how\r\nwidely the French of this generation differ from their fathers. And how\r\nis the difference to be explained? The race, the soil, the climate are\r\nthe same. If those dull, honest Englishmen, who explain the events of\r\n1793 and 1791 by saying that the French are naturally frivolous and\r\ncruel, were in the right, why is the guillotine now standing idle?\r\nNot surely for want of Carlists, of aristocrats, of people guilty of\r\nincivism, of people suspected of being suspicious characters. Is not the\r\ntrue explanation this, that the Frenchman of 1832 has been far better\r\ngoverned than the Frenchman of 1798,--that his soul has never been\r\ngalled by the oppressive privileges of a separate caste,--that he has\r\nbeen in some degree accustomed to discuss political questions, and\r\nto perform political functions,--that he has lived for seventeen or\r\neighteen years under institutions which, however defective, have yet\r\nbeen far superior to any institutions that had before existed in France?\r\n\r\nAs the second French Revolution has been far milder {54}than the first,\r\nso that great change which has just been effected in England has\r\nbeen milder even than the second French Revolution,--milder than any\r\nrevolution recorded in history. Some orators have described the\r\nreform of the House of Commons as a revolution. Others have denied the\r\npropriety of the term. The question, though in seeming merely a\r\nquestion of definition, suggests much curious and interesting matter for\r\nreflection. If we look at the magnitude of the reform, it may well\r\nbe called a revolution. If we look at the means by which it has been\r\neffected, it is merely an act of Parliament, regularly brought in, read,\r\ncommitted, and passed. In the whole history of England, there is no\r\nprouder circumstance than this,--that a change, which could not, in any\r\nother age, or in any other country, have been effected without physical\r\nviolence, should here have been effected by the force of reason,\r\nand under the forms of law. The work of three civil wars has been\r\naccomplished by three sessions of Parliament. An ancient and deeply\r\nrooted system of abuses has been fiercely attacked and stubbornly\r\ndefended. It has fallen; and not one sword has been drawn; not one\r\nestate has been confiscated; not one family has been forced to emigrate.\r\nThe bank has kept its credit. The funds have kept their price. Every man\r\nhas gone forth to his work and to his labour till the evening. During\r\nthe fiercest excitement of the contest,--during the first fortnight of\r\nthat immortal May,--there was not one moment at which any sanguinary\r\nact committed on the person of any of the most unpopular men in England\r\nwould not have filled the country with horror and indignation.\r\n\r\nAnd, now that the victory is won, has it been abused? An immense mass of\r\npower has been transferred {55}from an oligarchy to the nation. Are\r\nthe members of the vanquished oligarchy insecure? Does the nation seem\r\ndisposed to play the tyrant? Are not those who, in any other state of\r\nsociety, would have been visited with the severest vengeance of the\r\ntriumphant party,--would have been pining in dungeons, or flying to\r\nforeign countries,--still enjoying their possessions and their honours,\r\nstill taking part as freely as ever in public affairs? Two years ago\r\nthey were dominant. They are now vanquished. Yet the whole people would\r\nregard with horror any man who should dare to propose any vindictive\r\nmeasure. So common is this feeling,--so much is it a matter of course\r\namong us,--that many of our readers will scarcely understand what we see\r\nto admire in it.\r\n\r\nTo what are we to attribute the unparalleled moderation and humanity\r\nwhich the English people have displayed at this great conjuncture? The\r\nanswer is plain. This moderation, this humanity, are the fruits of a\r\nhundred and fifty years of liberty. During many generations we have had\r\nlegislative assemblies which, however defective their constitution might\r\nbe, have always contained many members chosen by the people, and many\r\nothers eager to obtain the approbation of the people;--assemblies in\r\nwhich perfect freedom of debate was allowed;--assemblies in which the\r\nsmallest minority had a fair hearing;--assemblies in which abuses,\r\neven when they were not redressed, were at least exposed. For many\r\ngenerations we have had the trial by jury, the Habeas Corpus Act, the\r\nfreedom of the press, the right of meeting to discuss public affairs,\r\nthe right of petitioning the legislature. A vast portion of the\r\npopulation has long been accustomed to the exercise of political\r\nfunctions, and has been thoroughly {56}seasoned to political excitement.\r\nIn most other countries there is no middle course between absolute\r\nsubmission and open rebellion. In England there has always been for\r\ncenturies a constitutional opposition. Thus our institutions had been so\r\ngood that they had educated us into a capacity for better institutions.\r\nThere is not a large town in the kingdom which does not contain better\r\nmaterials for a legislature than all France could furnish in 1789. There\r\nis not a spouting-club at any pot-house in London in which the rules of\r\ndebate are not better understood, and more strictly observed than in the\r\nConstituent Assembly. There is scarcely a Political Union which could\r\nnot frame in half an hour a declaration of rights superior to that which\r\noccupied the collective wisdom of France for several months.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible even to glance at all the causes of the French\r\nRevolution, within the limits to which we must confine ourselves. One\r\nthing is clear. The government, the aristocracy, and the church, were\r\nrewarded after their works. They reaped that which they had sown. They\r\nfound the nation such as they had made it. That the people had become\r\npossessed of irresistible power before they had attained the slightest\r\nknowledge of the art of government--that practical questions of vast\r\nmoment were left to be solved by men to whom politics had been only\r\nmatter of theory--that a legislature was composed of persons who were\r\nscarcely fit to compose a debating society--that the whole nation was\r\nready to lend an ear to any flatterer who appealed to its cupidity, to\r\nits fears, or to its thirst for vengeance--all this was the effect of\r\nmisrule, obstinately continued in defiance of solemn warnings, and of\r\nthe visible signs of an approaching retribution. {57}Even while the\r\nmonarchy seemed to be in its highest and most palmy state, the causes\r\nof that great destruction had already begun to operate. They may be\r\ndistinctly traced even under the reign of Louis the Fourteenth. That\r\nreign is the time to which the Ultra-Royalists refer as the Golden Age\r\nof France. It was in truth one of those periods which shine with an\r\nunnatural and delusive splendour, and which are rapidly followed by\r\ngloom and decay.\r\n\r\nConcerning Louis the Fourteenth himself, the world seems at last to\r\nhave formed a correct judgment. He was not a great general; he was not\r\na great statesman; but he was, in one sense of the words, a great king.\r\nNever was there so consummate a master of what our James the First would\r\nhave called king-craft,--of all those arts which most advantageously\r\ndisplay the merits of a prince, and most completely hide his defects.\r\nThough his internal administration was bad,--though the military\r\ntriumphs which gave splendour to the early part of his reign, were not\r\nachieved by himself,--though his later years were crowded with defeats\r\nand humiliations,--though he was so ignorant that he scarcely understood\r\nthe Latin of his mass-book,--though he fell under the control of a\r\ncunning Jesuit, and of a more cunning old woman,--he succeeded in\r\npassing himself off on his people as a being above humanity. And this\r\nis the more extraordinary, because he did not seclude himself from the\r\npublic gaze like those Oriental despots, whose faces are never seen, and\r\nwhose very names it is a crime to pronounce lightly. It has been said\r\nthat no man is a hero to his valet;--and all the world saw as much\r\nof Louis the Fourteenth as his valet could see. Five hundred people\r\nassembled to see him shave and put on his breeches in the morning.\r\n{58}He then kneeled down at the side of his bed, and said his prayer,\r\nwhile the whole assembly awaited the end in solemn silence,--the\r\necclesiastics on their knees and the laymen with their hats before their\r\nfaces. He walked about his gardens with a train of two hundred courtiers\r\nat his heels. All Versailles came to see him dine and sup. He was put to\r\nbed at night in the midst of a crowd as great as that which had met\r\nto see him rise in the morning. He took his very emetics in state, and\r\nvomited majestically in the presence of all the _grandes_ and _petites\r\nentrées_. Yet, though he constantly exposed himself to the public gaze\r\nin situations in which it is scarcely possible for any man to preserve\r\nmuch personal dignity, he to the last impressed those who surrounded him\r\nwith the deepest awe and reverence. The illusion which he produced on\r\nhis worshippers can be compared only to those illusions to which lovers\r\nare proverbially subject during the season of courtship. It was an\r\nillusion which affected even the senses. The contemporaries of Louis\r\nthought him tall. Voltaire, who might have seen him, and who had\r\nlived with some of the most distinguished members of his court, speaks\r\nrepeatedly of his majestic stature. Yet it is as certain as any fact\r\ncan be, that he was rather below than above the middle size. He had, it\r\nseems, a way of holding himself, a way of walking, a way of swelling his\r\nchest and rearing his head, which deceived the eyes of the multitude.\r\nEighty years after his death, the royal cemetery was violated by the\r\nrevolutionists; his coffin was opened; his body was dragged out; and\r\nit appeared that the prince, whose majestic figure had been so long and\r\nloudly extolled, was in truth a little man. (1) That fine\r\n\r\n     (1) Even M de Chataubriand, to whom we should have thought\r\n     all the Bourbons would have seemed at least six feet high,\r\n     admits this fact. “C’est une erreur,” says he in his strange\r\n     memoirs of the Duke of Berri, “de croire que Louis XIV.\r\n     étoit d’une haute stature. Une cuirasse qui nous reste de\r\n     lui, et les exhumations de St. Denys, n’ont laissé sur ce\r\n     point aucun doute.”\r\n\r\n{59}expression of Juvenal is singularly applicable, both in its literal\r\nand in its metaphorical sense, to Louis tin; Fourteenth:\r\n\r\n                             “Mors sola fatetur,\r\n\r\n                   Quantula sint hominum corpuscula.”\r\n\r\nHis person and his government have had the same fate. He had the art of\r\nmaking both appear grand and august, in spite of the clearest evidence\r\nthat both were below the ordinary standard. Death and time have exposed\r\nboth the deceptions. The body of the great king has been measured more\r\njustly than it was measured by the courtiers who were afraid to look\r\nabove his shoe-tie. His public character has been scrutinized by men\r\nfree from the hopes and fears of Boileau and Molière. In the grave, the\r\nmost majestic of princes is only five feet eight. In history, the hero\r\nand the politician dwindles into a vain and feeble tyrant,--the slave\r\nof priests and women,--little in war,--little in government,--little in\r\nevery thing but the art of simulating greatness.\r\n\r\nHe left to his infant successor a famished and miserable people, a\r\nbeaten and humbled army, provinces turned into deserts by misgovernment\r\nand persecution, factions dividing the court, a schism raging in the\r\nchurch, an immense debt, an empty treasury, immeasurable palaces, an\r\ninnumerable household, inestimable jewels and furniture. All the sap and\r\nnutriment of the state seemed to have been drawn to feed one bloated and\r\nunwholesome excrescence. The nation was withered. The court was morbidly\r\nflourishing. {60}Yet it does not appear that the associations which\r\nattached the people to the monarchy had lost strength during his reign.\r\nHe had neglected or sacrificed their dearest interests; but he had\r\nstruck their imaginations. The very things which ought to have made him\r\nmost unpopular,--the prodigies of luxury and magnificence with which his\r\nperson was surrounded, while, beyond the inclosure of his parks, nothing\r\nwas to be seen but starvation and despair,--seemed to increase the\r\nrespectful attachment which his subjects felt for him. That governments\r\nexist only for the good of the people, appears to be the most obvious\r\nand simple of all truths. Yet history proves that it is one of the most\r\nrecondite. We can scarcely wonder that it should be so seldom present\r\nto the minds of rulers, when we see how slowly, and through how much\r\nsuffering, nations arrive at the knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed one Frenchman who had discovered those principles which\r\nit now seems impossible to miss,--that the many are not made for the use\r\nof one,--that the truly good government is not that which concentrates\r\nmagnificence in a court, but that which diffuses happiness among a\r\npeople,--that a king who gains victory after victory, and adds province\r\nto province, may deserve, not the admiration, but the abhorrence and\r\ncontempt of mankind. These were the doctrines which Fénelon taught.\r\nConsidered as an epic poem, Telemachus can scarcely be placed above\r\nGlover’s Leonidas or Wilkie’s Epigoniad. Considered as a treatise on\r\npolitics and morals, it abounds with errors of detail; and the truths\r\nwhich it inculcates seem trite to a modern reader. But, if we compare\r\nthe spirit in which it is written with the spirit which pervades the\r\nrest of the French literature {61}of that age, we shall perceive that,\r\nthough in appearance trite, it was in truth one of the most original\r\nworks that have ever appeared. The fundamental principles of Fenelon’s\r\npolitical morality, the tests by which he judged of institutions and of\r\nmen, were absolutely new to his countrymen. He had taught them indeed,\r\nwith the happiest effect, to his royal pupil. But how incomprehensible\r\nthey were to most people, we learn from Saint Simon. That amusing\r\nwriter tells us, as a thing almost incredible, that the Duke of Burgundy\r\ndeclared it to be his opinion that kings existed for the good of\r\nthe people, and not the people for the good of kings. Saint Simon is\r\ndelighted with the benevolence of this saying; but startled by its\r\nnovelty, and terrified by its boldness. Indeed he distinctly says that\r\nit was not safe to repeat the sentiment in the court of Louis. Saint\r\nSimon was, of all the members of that court, the least courtly. He was\r\nas nearly an oppositionist as any man of his time. His disposition was\r\nproud, bitter, and cynical. In religion he was a Jansenist; in politics,\r\na less hearty royalist than most of his neighbours. His opinions and his\r\ntemper had preserved him from the illusions which the demeanour of Louis\r\nproduced on others. He neither loved nor respected the king. Yet even\r\nthis man,--one of the most liberal men in France,--was struck dumb\r\nwith astonishment at hearing the fundamental axiom of all government\r\npropounded,--an axiom which, in our time, nobody in England or France\r\nwould dispute,--which the stoutest Tory takes for granted as much as the\r\nfiercest Radical, and concerning which the Carlist would agree with the\r\nmost republican deputy of the “extreme left.” No person will do justice\r\nto Fenelon, who does not {62}constantly keep in mind that Telemachus\r\nwas written in an age and nation in which bold and independent thinkers\r\nstared to hear that twenty millions of human beings did not exist\r\nfor the gratification of one. That work is commonly considered as a\r\nschool-book, very fit for children, because its style is easy and its\r\nmorality blameless, but unworthy of the attention of statesmen and\r\nphilosophers. We can distinguish in it, if we are not greatly mistaken,\r\nthe first faint dawn of a long and splendid day of intellectual\r\nlight,--the dim promise of a great deliverance,--the undeveloped germ of\r\nthe charter and of the code.\r\n\r\nWhat mighty interests were staked on the life of the Duke of Burgundy!\r\nand how different an aspect might the history of France have borne if he\r\nhad attained the age of his grandfather or of his son;--if he had been\r\npermitted to show how much could be done for humanity by the highest\r\nvirtue in the highest fortune! There is scarcely anything in history\r\nmore remarkable than the descriptions which remain to us of that\r\nextraordinary man. The fierce and impetuous temper which he showed in\r\nearly youth,--the complete change which a judicious education produced\r\nin his character,--his fervid piety,--his large benevolence,--the\r\nstrictness with which he judged himself,--the liberality with which he\r\njudged others,--the fortitude with which alone, in the whole court, he\r\nstood up against the commands of Louis, when a religious scruple\r\nwas concerned,--the charity with which alone, in the whole court,\r\nhe defended the profligate Orleans against calumniators,--his great\r\nprojects for the good of the people,--his activity in business,--his\r\ntaste for letters,--his strong domestic attachments,--even the\r\nungraceful person and the shy and awkward manner which concealed\r\n{63}from the eyes of the sneering courtiers of his grandfather so many\r\nrare endowments,--make his character the most interesting that is to\r\nbe found in the annals of his house. He had resolved, if he came to the\r\nthrone, to disperse that ostentatious court, which was supported at\r\nan expense ruinous to the nation,--to preserve peace,--to correct the\r\nabuses which were found in every part of the system of revenue,--to\r\nabolish or modify oppressive privileges,--to reform the administration\r\nof justice,--to revive the institution of the States General. If he had\r\nruled over France during forty or fifty years, that great movement\r\nof the human mind, which no government could have arrested, which bad\r\ngovernment only rendered more violent, would, we are inclined to think,\r\nhave been conducted, by peaceable means, to a happy termination.\r\n\r\nDisease and sorrow removed from the world that wisdom and virtue of\r\nwhich it was not worthy. During two generations France was ruled by men\r\nwho, with all the vices of Louis the Fourteenth, had none of the art\r\nby which that magnificent prince passed off his vices for virtues. The\r\npeople had now to see tyranny naked. That foul Duessa was stripped\r\nof her gorgeous ornaments. She had always been hideous; but a strange\r\nenchantment had made her seem fair and glorious in the eyes of her\r\nwilling slaves. The spell was now broken; the deformity was made\r\nmanifest; and the lovers, lately so happy and so proud, turned away\r\nloathing and horror-struck.\r\n\r\nFirst came the Regency. The strictness, with which Louis had, towards\r\nthe close of his life, exacted from those around him an outward\r\nattention to religious duties, produced an effect similar to that which\r\nthe rigour of the Puritans had produced in England. It {64}was the boast\r\nof Madame de Maintenon, in the time of her greatness, that devotion had\r\nbecome the fashion. A fashion indeed it was; and, like a fashion, it\r\npassed away. The austerity of the tyrant’s old age had injured the\r\nmorality of the higher orders more than even the licentiousness of his\r\nyouth. Not only had he not reformed their vices, but, by forcing them to\r\nbe hypocrites, he had shaken their belief in virtue. They had found it\r\nso easy to perform the grimace of piety, that it was natural for them\r\nto consider all piety as grimace. The times were changed. Pensions,\r\nregiments, and abbeys, were no longer to be obtained by regular\r\nconfession and severe penance; and the obsequious courtiers, who had\r\nkept Lent like monks of La Trappe, and who had turned up the whites of\r\ntheir eyes at the edifying parts of sermons preached before the king,\r\naspired to the title of _roué_ as ardently as they had aspired to that\r\nof _dévot_; and went, during Passion Week, to the revels of the Palais\r\nRoyal as readily as they had formerly repaired to the sermons of\r\nMassillon.\r\n\r\nThe Regent was in many respects the fac-simile of our Charles the\r\nSecond. Like Charles, he was a good-natured man, utterly destitute\r\nof sensibility. Like Charles, he had good natural talents, which a\r\ndeplorable indolence rendered useless to the state. Like Charles, he\r\nthought all men corrupt and interested, and yet did not dislike them\r\nfor being so. His opinion of human nature was Gulliver’s; but he did not\r\nregard human nature with Gulliver’s horror. He thought that he and his\r\nfellow-creatures were Yahoos; and he thought a Yahoo a very agreeable\r\nkind of animal. No princes were ever more social than Charles and Philip\r\nof Orleans; yet no princes ever had less capacity for {65}friendship.\r\nThe tempers of these clever cynics were so easy, and their minds so\r\nlanguid, that habit supplied in them the place of affection, and made\r\nthem the tools of people for whom they cared not one straw. In love,\r\nboth were mere sensualists without delicacy or tenderness. In politics,\r\nboth were utterly careless of faith and of national honour. Charles shut\r\nup the Exchequer. Philip patronised the System. The councils of Charles\r\nwere swayed by the gold of Barillon; the councils of Philip by the gold\r\nof Walpole. Charles for private objects made war on Holland, the natural\r\nally of England. Philip for private objects made war on the Spanish\r\nbranch of the house of Bourbon, the natural ally, indeed the creature,\r\nof France. Even in trifling circumstances the parallel might be carried\r\non. Both these princes were fond of experimental philosophy, and passed\r\nin the laboratory much time which would have been more advantageously\r\npassed at the council-table. Both were more strongly attached to their\r\nfemale relatives than to any other human being; and in both cases it was\r\nsuspected that this attachment was not perfectly innocent. In personal\r\ncourage, and in all the virtues which are connected with personal\r\ncourage, the Regent was indisputably superior to Charles. Indeed Charles\r\nbut narrowly escaped the stain of cowardice. Philip was eminently brave,\r\nand, like most brave men, was generally open and sincere. Charles added\r\ndissimulation to his other vices.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the Regent was scarcely less pernicious, and\r\ninfinitely more scandalous, than that of the deceased monarch. It was\r\nby magnificent public works, and by wars conducted on a gigantic scale,\r\nthat Louis had brought distress on his people. The Regent aggravated\r\nthat distress by frauds of which a lame {66}duck on the stock-exchange\r\nwould have been ashamed. France, even while suffering under the most\r\nsevere calamities, had reverenced the conqueror. She despised the\r\nswindler.\r\n\r\nWhen Orleans and the wretched Dubois had disappeared, the power passed\r\nto the Duke of Bourbon; a prince degraded in the public eye by the\r\ninfamously lucrative part which he had taken in the juggles of the\r\nSystem, and by the humility with which he bore the caprices of a loose\r\nand imperious woman. It seemed to be decreed that every branch of the\r\nroyal family should successively incur the abhorrence and contempt of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nBetween the fall of the Duke of Bourbon and the death of Fleury, a few\r\nyears of frugal and moderate government intervened. Then recommenced the\r\ndownward progress of the monarchy. Profligacy in the court, extravagance\r\nin the finances, schism in the church, faction in the Parliaments,\r\nunjust war terminated by ignominious peace,--all that indicates and all\r\nthat produces the ruin of great empires, make up the history of that\r\nmiserable period. Abroad, the French were beaten and humbled every\r\nwhere, by land and by sea, on the Elbe and on the Rhine, in Asia and in\r\nAmerica. At home, they were turned over from vizier to vizier, and from\r\nsultana to sultana, till they had reached that point beneath which there\r\nwas no lower abyss of infamy,--till the yoke of Maupeou had made them\r\npine for Choiseul,--till Madame du Barri had taught them to regret\r\nMadame de Pompadour.\r\n\r\nBut, unpopular as the monarchy had become, the aristocracy was more\r\nunpopular still;--and not without reason. The tyranny of an individual\r\nis far more {67}supportable than the tyranny of a caste. The old\r\nprivileges were galling and hateful to the new wealth and the\r\nnew knowledge. Every thing indicated the approach of no common\r\nrevolution,--of a revolution destined to change, not merely the form\r\nof government, but the distribution of property and the whole social\r\nsystem,--of a revolution the effects of which were to be felt at every\r\nfireside in France,--of a new Jaquerie, in which the victory was to\r\nremain with _Jaques bonhomme_. In the van of the movement were the\r\nmoneyed men and the men of letters,--the wounded pride of wealth and\r\nthe wounded pride of intellect. An immense multitude, made ignorant and\r\ncruel by oppression, was raging in the rear.\r\n\r\nWe greatly doubt whether any course which could have been pursued by\r\nLouis the Sixteenth could have averted a great convulsion. But we are\r\nsure that, if there was such a course, it was the course recommended\r\nby M. Turgot. The church and the aristocracy, with that blindness to\r\ndanger, that incapacity of believing that anything can be except what\r\nhas been, which the long possession of power seldom fails to generate,\r\nmocked at the counsel which might have saved them. They would not have\r\nreform; and they had revolution. They would not pay a small contribution\r\nin place of the odious corvées; and they lived to see their castles\r\ndemolished, and their lands sold to strangers. They would not endure\r\nTurgot; and they were forced to endure Robespierre.\r\n\r\nThen the rulers of France, as if smitten with judicial blindness,\r\nplunged headlong into the American war. They thus committed at once two\r\ngreat errors. They encouraged the spirit of revolution. They augmented\r\n{68}at the same time those public burdens, the pressure of which is\r\ngenerally the immediate cause of revolutions. The event of the war\r\ncarried to the height the enthusiasm of speculative democrats. The\r\nfinancial difficulties produced by the war carried to the height the\r\ndiscontent of that larger body of people who cared little about theories\r\nand much about taxes.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the States-General was the signal for the explosion of\r\nall the hoarded passions of a century. In that assembly, there were\r\nundoubtedly very able men. But they had no practical knowledge of the\r\nart of government. All the great English revolutions have been conducted\r\nby practical statesmen. The French Revolution was conducted by mere\r\nspeculators. Our constitution has never been so far behind the age as to\r\nhave become an object of aversion to the people. The English revolutions\r\nhave therefore been undertaken for the purpose of defending, correcting,\r\nand restoring,--never for the mere purpose of destroying. Our countrymen\r\nhave always, even in times of the greatest excitement, spoken reverently\r\nof the form of government under which they lived, and attacked only what\r\nthey regarded as its corruptions. In the very act of innovating they\r\nhave constantly appealed to ancient prescription; they have seldom\r\nlooked abroad for models; they have seldom troubled themselves with\r\nUtopian theories; they have not been anxious to prove that liberty is a\r\nnatural right of men; they have been content to regard it as the lawful\r\nbirthright of Englishmen. Their social contract is no fiction. It\r\nis still extant on the original parchment, sealed with wax which was\r\naffixed at Runnymede, and attested by the lordly names of the Marischals\r\nand Fitzherberts. No general arguments about the original equality of\r\nmen, no fine {69}stories out of Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos, have\r\never affected them so much as their own familiar words,--Magna\r\nCharta,--Habeas Corpus,--Trial by Jury,--Bill of Rights. This part of\r\nour national character has undoubtedly its disadvantages. An Englishman\r\ntoo often reasons on politics in the spirit rather of a lawyer than of\r\na philosopher. There is too often something narrow, something exclusive,\r\nsomething Jewish, if we may use the word, in his love of freedom. He\r\nis disposed to consider popular rights as the special heritage of the\r\nchosen race to which he belongs. He is inclined rather to repel than to\r\nencourage the alien proselyte who aspires to a share of his privileges.\r\nVery different was the spirit of the Constituent Assembly. They had\r\nnone of our narrowness; but they had none of our practical skill in the\r\nmanagement of affairs. They did not understand how to regulate the order\r\nof their own debates; and they thought themselves able to legislate for\r\nthe whole world. All the past was loathsome to them. All their agreeable\r\nassociations were connected with the future. Hopes were to them all that\r\nrecollections are to us. In the institutions of their country they found\r\nnothing to love or to admire. As far back as they could look, they saw\r\nonly the tyranny of one class and the degradation of another,--Frank\r\nand Gaul, knight and villein, gentleman and _roturier_. They hated the\r\nmonarchy, the church, the nobility. They cared nothing for the States or\r\nthe Parliament. It was long the fashion to ascribe all the follies which\r\nthey committed to the writings of the philosophers. We believe that\r\nit was misrule, and nothing but misrule, that put the sting into those\r\nwritings. It is not time that the French abandoned experience for\r\ntheories. They took up with theories because {70}they had no experience\r\nof good government. It was because they had no charter that they ranted\r\nabout the original contract. As soon as tolerable institutions were\r\ngiven to them, they began to look to those institutions. In 1830 their\r\nrallying cry was _Vive la Charte_. In 1789 they had nothing but theories\r\nround which to rally. They had seen social distinctions only in a\r\nbad form; and it was therefore natural that they should be deluded by\r\nsophisms about the equality of men. They had experienced so much evil\r\nfrom the sovereignty of kings that they might be excused for lending a\r\nready ear to those who preached, in an exaggerated form, the doctrine of\r\nthe sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\nThe English, content with their own national recollections and names,\r\nhave never sought for models in the institutions of Greece or Rome. The\r\nFrench, having nothing in their own history to which they could look\r\nback with pleasure, had recourse to the history of the great ancient\r\ncommonwealths: they drew their notions of those commonwealths, not from\r\ncontemporary writers, but from romances written by pedantic moralists\r\nlong after the extinction of public liberty. They neglected Thucydides\r\nfor Plutarch. Blind themselves, they took blind guides. They had no\r\nexperience of freedom; and they took their opinions concerning it\r\nfrom men who had no more experience of it than themselves, and whose\r\nimaginations, inflamed by mystery and privation, exaggerated the unknown\r\nenjoyment;--from men who raved about patriotism without having ever had\r\na country, and eulogised tyrannicide while crouching before tyrants.\r\nThe maxim which the French legislators learned in this school was, that\r\npolitical liberty is an end, and not a means; that it is not merely\r\nvaluable as the great safe-guard of order, of property, {71}and of\r\nmorality, but that it is in itself a high and exquisite happiness to\r\nwhich order, property, and morality ought without one scruple to be\r\nsacrificed. The lessons which may be learned from ancient history are\r\nindeed most useful and important; but they were not likely to be learned\r\nby men who, in all their rhapsodies about the Athenian democracy, seemed\r\nutterly to forget that in that democracy there were ten slaves to one\r\ncitizen; and who constantly decorated their invectives against the\r\naristocrats with panegyrics on Brutus and Cato,--two aristocrats,\r\nfiercer, prouder, and more exclusive, than any that emigrated with the\r\nCount of Artois.\r\n\r\nWe have never met with so vivid and interesting a picture of the\r\nNational Assembly as that which M. Dumont has set before us. His\r\nMirabeau, in particular, is incomparable. All the former Mirabeaus\r\nwere daubs in comparison. Some were merely painted from the\r\nimagination--others were gross caricatures: this is the very individual,\r\nneither god nor demon, but a man--a Frenchman,--a Frenchman of the\r\neighteenth century, with great talents, with strong passions, depraved\r\nby bad education, surrounded by temptations of every kind,--made\r\ndesperate at one time by disgrace, and then again intoxicated by fame.\r\nAll his opposite and seemingly inconsistent qualities are in this\r\nrepresentation so blended together as to make up a harmonious and\r\nnatural whole. Till now, Mirabeau was to us, and, we believe, to most\r\nreaders of history, not a man, but a string of antitheses. Henceforth he\r\nwill be a real human being, a remarkable and eccentric being indeed, but\r\nperfectly conceivable.\r\n\r\nHe was fond, M. Dumont tells us, of giving odd compound nicknames. Thus,\r\nM. de Lafayette was {72}Grandison-Cromwell; the king of Prussia was\r\nAlaric-Cottin; D’Espremenil was Crispin-Catiline. We think that Mirabeau\r\nhimself might be described, after his own fashion, as a Wilkes-Chatham.\r\nHe had Wilkes’s sensuality, Wilkes’s levity, Wilkes’s insensibility to\r\nshame. Like Wilkes, he had brought on himself the censure even of men\r\nof pleasure by the peculiar grossness of his immorality, and by the\r\nobscenity of his writings. Like Wilkes, he was heedless, not only of\r\nthe laws of morality, but of the laws of honour. Yet he affected, like\r\nWilkes, to unite the character of the demagogue to that of the fine\r\ngentleman. Like Wilkes, he conciliated, by his good humour and his high\r\nspirits, the regard of many who despised his character. Like Wilkes,\r\nhe was hideously ugly; like Wilkes, he made a jest of his own ugliness;\r\nand, like Wilkes, he was, in spite of his ugliness, very attentive to\r\nhis dress, and very successful in affairs of gallantry.\r\n\r\nResembling Wilkes in the lower and grosser parts of his character, he\r\nhad, in his higher qualities, some affinity to Chatham. His eloquence,\r\nas far as we can judge of it, bore no inconsiderable resemblance to that\r\nof the great English minister. He was not eminently successful in long\r\nset speeches. He was not, on the other hand, a close and ready debater.\r\nSudden bursts, which seemed to be the effect of inspiration--short\r\nsentences which came like lightning, dazzling, burning, striking down\r\nevery thing before them--sentences which, spoken at critical moments,\r\ndecided the fate of great questions--sentences which at once became\r\nproverbs--sentences which everybody still knows by heart--in these\r\nchiefly lay the oratorical power both of Chatham and of Mirabeau. There\r\nhave been far greater speakers, and far greater statesmen, than either\r\n{73}of them; but we doubt whether any men have, in modern times,\r\nexercised such vast personal influence over stormy and divided\r\nassemblies. The power of both was as much moral as intellectual. In true\r\ndignity of character, in private and public virtue, it may seem\r\nabsurd to institute any comparison between them; but they had the same\r\nhaughtiness and vehemence of temper. In their language and manner there\r\nwas a disdainful self-confidence, an imperiousness, a fierceness of\r\npassion, before which all common minds quailed. Even Murray and Charles\r\nTownshend, though intellectually not inferior to Chatham, were always\r\ncowed by him. Barnave, in the same manner, though the best debater in\r\nthe National Assembly, flinched before the energy of Mirabeau. Men,\r\nexcept in bad novels, are not all good or all evil. It can scarcely be\r\ndenied that the virtue of Lord Chatham was a little theatrical. On the\r\nother hand there was in Mirabeau, not indeed any thing deserving the\r\nname of virtue, but that imperfect substitute for virtue which is found\r\nin almost all superior minds,--a sensibility to the beautiful and the\r\ngood, which sometimes amounted to sincere enthusiasm; and which, mingled\r\nwith the desire of admiration, sometimes gave to his character a lustre\r\nresembling the lustre of true goodness,--as the “faded splendour wan”\r\n which lingered round the fallen archangel resembled the exceeding\r\nbrightness of those spirits who had kept their first estate.\r\n\r\nThere are several other admirable portraits of eminent men in these\r\nMemoirs. That of Sieyes in particular, and that of Talleyrand, are\r\nmasterpieces, full of life and expression. But nothing in the book has\r\ninterested us more than the view which M. Dumont has presented to\r\nus, unostentatiously, and, we {74}may say, unconsciously, of his own\r\ncharacter. The sturdy rectitude, the large charity, the good-nature, the\r\nmodesty, the independent spirit, the ardent philanthropy, the unaffected\r\nindifference to money and to fame, make up a character which, while it\r\nhas nothing unnatural, seems to us to approach nearer to perfection than\r\nany of the Grandisons and Allworthys of fiction. The work is not indeed\r\nprecisely such a work as we had anticipated--it is more lively, more\r\npicturesque, more amusing than we had promised ourselves; and it is, on\r\nthe other hand, less profound and philosophic. But, if it is not, in\r\nall respects, such as might have been expected from the intellect of M.\r\nDumont, it is assuredly such as might have been expected from his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR OF THE SUCCESSION IN SPAIN. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, January, 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe {75}days when Miscellanies in Prose and Verse by a Person of\r\nHonour, and Romances of M. Scuderi, done into English by a Person of\r\nQuality, were attractive to readers and profitable to booksellers,\r\nhave long gone by. The literary privileges once enjoyed by lords are\r\nas obsolete as their right to kill the King’s deer on their way to\r\nParliament, or as their old remedy of _scandalum magnatum_. Yet we\r\nmust acknowledge that, though our political opinions are by no means\r\naristocratical, we always feel kindly disposed towards noble authors.\r\nIndustry and a taste for intellectual pleasures are peculiarly\r\nrespectable in those who can afford to be idle and who have every\r\ntemptation to be dissipated. It is impossible not to wish success to a\r\nman who, finding himself placed, without any exertion or any merit\r\non his part, above the mass of society, voluntarily descends from his\r\neminence in search of distinctions which he may justly call his own.\r\n\r\nThis is, we think, the second appearance of Lord Mahon in the character\r\nof an author. His first book was creditable to him, but was in every\r\nrespect inferior to the work which now lies before us. He has\r\n\r\n     (1) _History of the War of the Succession in Spain_. By Lord\r\n     Mahon. 8vo London: 1832.\r\n\r\n{76}undoubtedly some of the most valuable qualities of a historian,\r\ngreat diligence in examining authorities, great judgment in weighing\r\ntestimony, and great impartiality in estimating characters. We are not\r\naware that he has in any instance forgotten the duties belonging to his\r\nliterary functions in the feelings of a kinsman. He does no more than\r\njustice to his ancestor Stanhope; he does full justice to Stanhope’s\r\nenemies and rivals. His narrative is very perspicuous, and is also\r\nentitled to the praise, seldom, we grieve to say, deserved by modern\r\nwriters, of being very concise. It must be admitted, however, that, with\r\nmany of the best qualities of a literary veteran, he has some of the\r\nfaults of a literary novice. He has not yet acquired a great command of\r\nwords. His style is seldom easy, and is now and then unpleasantly stiff.\r\nHe is so bigoted a purist that he transforms the Abbé d’Estrées into\r\nan Abbot. We do not like to see French words introduced into English\r\ncomposition; but, after all, the first law of writing, that law to which\r\nall other laws are subordinate, is this, that the words employed shall\r\nbe such as convey to the reader the meaning of the writer. Now an Abbot\r\nis the head of a religious house; an Abbé is quite a different sort of\r\nperson. It is better undoubtedly to use an English word than a French\r\nword: but it is better to use a French word than to misuse an English\r\nword.\r\n\r\nLord Mahon is also a little too fond of uttering moral reflections in a\r\nstyle too sententious and oracular. We will give one instance: “Strange\r\nas it seems, experience shows that we usually feel far more animosity\r\nagainst those whom we have injured than against those who injure us: and\r\nthis remark holds good with every degree of intellect, with every class\r\nof fortune, {77}with a prince or a peasant, a stripling or an elder, a\r\nhero or a prince.” This remark might have seemed strange at the court\r\nof Nimrod or Chedorlaomer; but it has now been for many generations\r\nconsidered as a truism rather than a paradox. Every boy has written\r\non the thesis “_Odisse quem laeseris_.” Scarcely any lines in English\r\nPoetry are better known than that vigorous couplet,\r\n\r\n               “Forgiveness to the injured does belong;\r\n\r\n               But they ne’er pardon who have done the wrong.”\r\n\r\nThe historians and philosophers have quite done with this maxim, and\r\nhave abandoned it, like other maxims which have lost their gloss, to bad\r\nnovelists, by whom it will very soon be worn to rags.\r\n\r\nIt is no more than justice to say that the faults of Lord Mahon’s book\r\nare precisely the faults which time seldom fails to cure, and that the\r\nbook, in spite of those faults, is a valuable addition to our historical\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nWhoever wishes to be well acquainted with the morbid anatomy of\r\ngovernments, whoever wishes to know how great states may be made feeble\r\nand wretched, should study the history of Spain. The empire of Philip\r\nthe Second was undoubtedly one of the most powerful and splendid that\r\never existed in the world. In Europe, he ruled Spain, Portugal, the\r\nNetherlands on both sides of the Rhine, Franche Comte, Roussillon, the\r\nMilanese, and the Two Sicilies. Tuscany, Parma, and the other small\r\nstates of Italy, were as completely dependent on him as the Nizam and\r\nthe Rajah of Berar now are on the East India Company. In Asia, the King\r\nof Spain was master of the Philippines and of all those rich settlements\r\nwhich the Portuguese had made on the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel,\r\nin the {78}Peninsula of Malacca, and in the spice-islands of the Eastern\r\nArchipelago. In America, his dominions extended on each side of the\r\nequator into the temperate zone. There is reason to believe that his\r\nannual revenue amounted, in the season of his greatest power, to a sum\r\nnear ten times as large as that which England yielded to Elizabeth. He\r\nhad a standing army of fifty thousand excellent troops, at a time when\r\nEngland had not a single battalion in constant pay. His ordinary naval\r\nforce consisted of a hundred and forty galleys. He held, what no other\r\nprince in modern times has held, the dominion both of the land and of\r\nthe sea. During the greater part of his reign, he was supreme on both\r\nelements. His soldiers marched up to the capital of France; his ships\r\nmenaced the shores of England.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, during several years, his power over\r\nEurope was greater than even that of Napoleon. The influence of the\r\nFrench conqueror never extended beyond low-water mark. The narrowest\r\nstrait was to his power what it was of old believed that a running\r\nstream was to the sorceries of a witch. While his army entered every\r\nmetropolis from Moscow to Lisbon, the English fleets blockaded every\r\nport from Dantzic to Trieste. Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca, Guernsey,\r\nenjoyed security through the whole course of a war which endangered\r\nevery throne on the Continent. The victorious and imperial nation which\r\nhad filled its museums with the spoils of Antwerp, of Florence, and of\r\nRome, was suffering painfully from the want of luxuries which use had\r\nmade necessaries. While pillars and arches were rising to commemorate\r\nthe French conquests, the conquerors were trying to manufacture coffee\r\nout of succory and sugar out of beet-root. The influence of Philip\r\non the Continent {79}was as great as that of Napoleon. The Emperor of\r\nGermany was his kinsman. France, torn by religious dissensions, was\r\nnever a formidable opponent, and was sometimes a dependent ally. At the\r\nsame time, Spain had what Napoleon desired in vain, ships, colonies, and\r\ncommerce. She long monopolised the trade of America and of the Indian\r\nOcean. All the gold of the West, and all the spices of the East, were\r\nreceived and distributed by her. During many years of war, her commerce\r\nwas interrupted only by the predatory enterprises of a few roving\r\nprivateers. Even after the defeat of the Armada, English statesmen\r\ncontinued to look with great dread on the maritime power of Philip. “The\r\nKing of Spain,” said the Lord Keeper to the two Houses in 1593, “since\r\nhe hath usurped upon the kingdom of Portugal, hath thereby grown mighty\r\nby chaining the East Indies: so as, how great soever he was before, he\r\nis now thereby manifestly more great:.... He keepeth a navy armed to\r\nimpeach all trade of merchandise from England to Gascoigne and Guienne,\r\nwhich he attempted to do this last vintage; so as he is now become as\r\na frontier enemy to all the west of England, as well as all the south\r\nparts, as Sussex, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight. Yea, by means of\r\nhis interest in St. Maloes, a port full of shipping for the war, he is a\r\ndangerous neighbour to the Queen’s isles of Jersey and Guernsey, ancient\r\npossessions of this crown, and never conquered in the greatest wars with\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\nThe ascendency which Spain then had in Europe was, in one sense, well\r\ndeserved. It was an ascendency which had been gained by unquestioned\r\nsuperiority in all the arts of policy and of war. In the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Italy was not more decidedly the land {80}of the fine arts,\r\nGermany was not more decidedly the land of bold theological speculation,\r\nthan Spain was the land of statesmen and of soldiers. The character\r\nwhich Virgil has ascribed to his countrymen might have been claimed by\r\nthe grave and haughty chiefs, who surrounded the throne of Ferdinand the\r\nCatholic, and of his immediate successors. That majestic art, “regere\r\nimperio populos,” was not better understood by the Romans in the\r\nproudest days of their republic, than by Gonsalvo and Ximenes, Cortez\r\nand Alva. The skill of the Spanish diplomatists was renowned throughout\r\nEurope. In England the name of Gondomar is still remembered. The\r\nsovereign nation was unrivalled both in regular and irregular warfare.\r\nThe impetuous chivalry of France, the serried phalanx of Switzerland,\r\nwere alike found wanting when brought face to face with the Spanish\r\ninfantry. In the wars of the New World, where something different from\r\nordinary strategy was required in the general and something different\r\nfrom ordinary discipline in the soldier, where it was every day\r\nnecessary to meet by some new expedient the varying tactics of a\r\nbarbarous enemy, the Spanish adventurers, sprung from the common people,\r\ndisplayed a fertility of resource, and a talent for negotiation and\r\ncommand, to which history scarcely affords a parallel.\r\n\r\nThe Castilian of those times was to the Italian what the Roman, in the\r\ndays of the greatness of Rome, was to the Greek. The conqueror had less\r\ningenuity, less taste, less delicacy of perception than the conquered;\r\nbut far more pride, firmness, and courage, a more solemn demeanour, a\r\nstronger sense of honour. The subject had more subtlety in speculation,\r\nthe ruler more energy in action. The vices of the former were those of\r\na {81}coward; the vices of the latter were those of a tyrant. It may be\r\nadded, that the Spaniard, like the Roman, did not disdain to study the\r\narts and the language of those whom he oppressed. A revolution took\r\nplace in the literature of Spain, not unlike that revolution which,\r\nas Horace tells us, took place in the poetry of Latium: “Capta ferum\r\nvictorem cepit.” The slave took prisoner the enslaver. The old Castilian\r\nballads gave place to sonnets in the style of Petrarch, and to heroic\r\npoems in the stanza of Ariosto, as the national songs of Rome were\r\ndriven out by imitations of Theocritus, and translations from Menander.\r\n\r\nIn no modern society, not even in England during the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nhas there been so great a number of men eminent at once in literature\r\nand in the pursuits of active life, as Spain produced during the\r\nsixteenth century. Almost every distinguished writer was also\r\ndistinguished as a soldier and a politician, Boscan bore arms with\r\nhigh reputation. Garcilaso de Vega, the author of the sweetest and\r\nmost graceful pastoral poem of modern times, after a short but splendid\r\nmilitary career, fell sword in hand at the head of a storming party.\r\nAlonzo de Ercilla bore a conspicuous part in that war of Arauco, which\r\nhe afterwards celebrated in one of the best heroic poems that Spain has\r\nproduced. Hurtado de Mendoza, whose poems have been compared to those\r\nof Horace, and whose charming little novel is evidently the model of Gil\r\nBias, has been handed down to us by history as one of the sternest of\r\nthose iron pro-consuls who were employed by the House of Austria to\r\ncrush the lingering public spirit of Italy. Lope sailed in the Armada;\r\nCervantes was wounded at Lepanto.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to consider with how much awe our ancestors {82}in those\r\ntimes regarded a Spaniard. He was, in their apprehension, a kind of\r\ndæmon, horribly malevolent, but withal most sagacious and powerful.\r\n“They be verye wyse and politicke,” says an honest Englishman, in a\r\nmemorial addressed to Mary, “and can, thorowe ther wysdome, reform and\r\nbrydell theyr owne natures for a tyme, and applye their conditions to\r\nthe maners of those men with whom they meddell gladlye by friendshippe;\r\nwhose mischievous maners a man shall never knowe untyll he come under\r\nther subjection: but then shall he parfectlye parceyve and fele them:\r\nwhich thynge I praye God England never do: for in dissimulations untyll\r\nthey have ther purposes, and afterwards in oppression and tyrannye,\r\nwhen they can obtayne them, they do exceed all other nations upon the\r\nearthe.” This is just such language as Anninius would have used about\r\nthe Romans, or as an Indian statesman of our times might use about the\r\nEnglish. It is the language of a man burning with hatred, but cowed by\r\nthose whom he hates; and painfully sensible of their superiority, not\r\nonly in power, but in intelligence.\r\n\r\nBut how art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How\r\nart thou cut down to the ground, that didst weaken the nations! If we\r\noverleap a hundred years, and look at Spain towards the close of the\r\nseventeenth centnry, what a change do we find! The contrast is as great\r\nas that which the Rome of Gallienus and Honorius presents to the Rome of\r\nMarins and Caesar. Foreign conquest had begun to eat into every part of\r\nthat gigantic monarchy on which the sun never set. Holland was gone, and\r\nPortugal, and Artois, and Roussillon, and Franche Comté. In the\r\nEast, the empire founded by the Dutch far surpassed {83}in wealth and\r\nsplendour that which their old tyrants still retained. In the West,\r\nEngland had seized, and still held, settlements in the midst of the\r\nMexican sea.\r\n\r\nThe mere loss of territory was, however, of little moment. The reluctant\r\nobedience of distant provinces generally costs more than it is worth.\r\nEmpires which branch out widely are often more flourishing for a little\r\ntimely pruning. Adrian acted judiciously when he abandoned the conquests\r\nof Trajan; and England was never so rich, so great, so formidable to\r\nforeign princes, so absolutely mistress of the sea, as since the loss\r\nof her American colonies. The Spanish empire was still, in outward\r\nappearance, great and magnificent. The European dominions subject to the\r\nlast feeble Prince of the House of Austria were far more extensive\r\nthan those of Lewis the Fourteenth. The American dependencies of the\r\nCastilian crown still extended far to the North of Cancer and far to the\r\nSouth of Capricorn. But within this immense body there was an incurable\r\ndecay, an utter want of tone, an utter prostration of strength. An\r\ningenious and diligent population, eminently skilled in arts and\r\nmanufactures, had been driven into exile by stupid and remorseless\r\nbigots. The glory of the Spanish pencil had departed with Velasquez and\r\nMurillo. The splendid age of Spanish literature had closed with Solis\r\nand Calderon. During the seventeenth century many states had formed\r\ngreat military establishments. But the Spanish army, so formidable under\r\nthe command of Alva and Farnese, had dwindled away to a few thousand\r\nmen, ill paid and ill disciplined. England, Holland, and France had\r\ngreat navies. But the Spanish navy was scarcely equal to the tenth part\r\nof that mighty force which, in {84}the time of Philip the Second, had\r\nbeen the terror of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The arsenals were\r\ndeserted. The magazines were unprovided. The frontier fortresses were\r\nungarrisoned. The police was utterly inefficient for the protection\r\nof the people. Murders were committed in the face of day with perfect\r\nimpunity. Bravoes and discarded serving-men, with swords at their sides,\r\nswaggered every day through the most public streets and squares of\r\nthe capital, disturbing the public peace, and setting at defiance the\r\nministers of justice. The finances were in frightful disorder. The\r\npeople paid much. The government received little. The American viceroys\r\nand the farmers of the revenue became rich, while the merchants broke,\r\nwhile the peasantry starved while the body-servants of the sovereign\r\nremained unpaid, while the soldiers of the royal guard repaired daily to\r\nthe doors of convents, and battled there with the crowd of beggars for\r\na porringer of broth and a morsel of bread. Every remedy which was\r\ntried aggravated the disease. The currency was altered; and this frantic\r\nmeasure produced its never-failing effects. It destroyed all credit,\r\nand increased the misery which it was intended to relieve. The American\r\ngold, to use the words of Ortiz, was to the necessities of the state\r\nbut as a drop of water to the lips of a man raging with thirst. Heaps of\r\nunopened despatches accumulated in the offices, while the Ministers were\r\nconcerting with bedchamber-women and Jesuits the means of tripping up\r\neach other. Every foreign power could plunder and insult with impunity\r\nthe heir of Charles the Fifth. Into such a state had the mighty kingdom\r\nof Spain fallen, while one of its smallest dependencies, a country not\r\nso large as the province of Estremadura or Andalusia, situated under\r\n{85}an inclement sky, and preserved only by artificial means from the\r\ninroads of the ocean, had become a power of the first class, and treated\r\non terms of equality with the courts of London and Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Lord Mahon explains the financial situation of\r\nSpain by no means satisfies us. “It will be found,” says he, “that those\r\nindividuals deriving their chief income from mines, whose yearly produce\r\nis uncertain and varying, and seems rather to spring from fortune than\r\nto follow industry, are usually careless, unthrifty, and irregular in\r\ntheir expenditure. The example of Spain might tempt us to apply the same\r\nremark to states.” Lord Mahon would find it difficult, we suspect, to\r\nmake out his analogy. Nothing could be more uncertain and varying than\r\nthe gains and losses of those who were in the habit of putting into the\r\nstate lotteries. But no part of the public income was more certain than\r\nthat which was derived from the lotteries. We believe that this case is\r\nvery similar to that of the American mines. Some veins of ore exceeded\r\nexpectation; some fell below it. Some of the private speculators drew\r\nblanks, and others gained prizes. But the revenue of the state depended,\r\nnot on any particular vein, but on the whole annual produce of two great\r\ncontinents. This annual produce seems to have been almost constantly\r\non the increase during the seventeenth century. The Mexican mines were,\r\nthrough the reigns of Philip the Fourth and Charles the Second, in a\r\nsteady course of improvement; and in South America, though the district\r\nof Potosi was not so productive as formerly, other places more than made\r\nup for the deficiency. We very much doubt whether Lord Mahon can prove\r\nthat the income which the Spanish government derived from the mines\r\n{86}of America fluctuated more than the income derived from the internal\r\ntaxes of Spain itself.\r\n\r\nAll the causes of the decay of Spain resolve themselves into one cause,\r\nbad government. The valour, the intelligence, the energy which, at the\r\nclose of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century, had\r\nmade the Spaniards the first nation in the world, were the fruits of\r\nthe old institutions of Castile and Arragon, institutions eminently\r\nfavourable to public liberty. Those institutions the first Princes\r\nof the House of Austria attacked and almost wholly destroyed. Their\r\nsuccessors expiated the crime. The effects of a change from good\r\ngovernment to bad government is not fully felt for some time after\r\nthe change has taken place. The talents and the virtues which a good\r\nconstitution generates may for a time survive that constitution. Thus\r\nthe reigns of princes who have established absolute monarchy on the\r\nruins of popular forms of government often shine in history with a\r\npeculiar brilliancy. But when a generation or two has passed away,\r\nthen comes signally to pass that which was written by Montesquieu, that\r\ndespotic governments resemble those savages who cut down the tree in\r\norder to get at the fruit. During the first years of tyranny, is reaped\r\nthe harvest sown during the last years of liberty. Thus the Augustan age\r\nwas rich in great minds formed in the generation of Cicero and Caesar.\r\nThe fruits of the policy of Augustus were reserved for posterity. Philip\r\nthe Second was the heir of the Cortez and of the Justiza Mayor; and\r\nthey left him a nation which seemed able to conquer all the world. What\r\nPhilip left to his successors is well known.\r\n\r\nThe shock which the great religious schism of the sixteenth century gave\r\nto Europe, was scarcely felt {87}in Spain. In England, Germany, Holland,\r\nFrance, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, that shock had produced, with some\r\ntemporary evil, much durable good. The principles of the Reformation had\r\ntriumphed in some of those countries. The Catholic Church had maintained\r\nits ascendency in others. But though the event had not been the same in\r\nall, all had been agitated by the conflict. Even in France, in Southern\r\nGermany, and in the Catholic cantons of Switzerland, the public mind\r\nhad been stirred to its inmost depths. The hold of ancient prejudice had\r\nbeen somewhat loosened. The Church of Rome, warned by the danger which\r\nshe had narrowly escaped, had, in those parts of her dominion, assumed a\r\nmilder and more liberal character. She sometimes condescended to submit\r\nher high pretensions to the scrutiny of reason, and availed herself more\r\nsparingly than in former times of the aid of the secular arm. Even when\r\npersecution was employed, it was not persecution in the worst and most\r\nfrightful shape. The severities of Lewis the Fourteenth, odious as they\r\nwere, cannot be compared with those which, at the first dawn of the\r\nReformation, had been inflicted on the heretics in many parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe only effect which the Reformation had produced in Spain had been to\r\nmake the Inquisition more vigilant and the commonalty more bigoted. The\r\ntimes of refreshing came to all neighboring; countries. One people alone\r\nremained, like the fleece of the Hebrew warrior, dry in the midst of\r\nthat benignant and fertilising dew. While other nations were putting\r\naway childish things, the Spaniard still thought as a child and\r\nunderstood as a child. Among the men of the seventeenth century, he\r\nwas the man of the fifteenth {88}century or of a still darker period,\r\ndelighted to behold an _Auto da fe_, and ready to volunteer on a\r\nCrusade.\r\n\r\nThe evils produced by a bad government and a bad religion, seemed\r\nto have attained their greatest height during the last years of the\r\nseventeenth century. While the kingdom was in this deplorable state, the\r\nKing, Charles, second of the name, was hastening to an early grave. His\r\ndays had been few and evil. He had been unfortunate in all his wars,\r\nin every part of his internal administration, and in all his domestic\r\nrelations. His first wife, whom he tenderly loved, died very young. His\r\nsecond wife exercised great influence over him, but seems to have been\r\nregarded by him rather with fear than with love. He was childless; and\r\nhis constitution was so completely shattered that, at little more than\r\nthirty years of age, he had given up all hopes of posterity. His mind\r\nwas even more distempered than his body. He was sometimes sunk in\r\nlistless melancholy, and sometimes harassed by the wildest and most\r\nextravagant fancies. He was not, however, wholly destitute of the\r\nfeelings which became his station. His sufferings were aggravated by the\r\nthought that his own dissolution might not improbably be followed by the\r\ndissolution of his empire.\r\n\r\nSeveral princes laid claim to the succession. The King’s eldest sister\r\nhad married Lewis the Fourteenth. The Dauphin would, therefore, in\r\nthe common course of inheritance, have succeeded to the crown. But the\r\nInfanta had, at the time of her espousals, solemnly renounced, in her\r\nown name, and in that of her posterity, all claim to the succession.\r\nThis renunciation had been confirmed in due form by the Cortes. A\r\nyounger sister of the King had been the first wife of {89}Leopold,\r\nEmperor of Germany. She too had at her marriage renounced her claims to\r\nthe Spanish crown; but the Cortes had not sanctioned the renunciation,\r\nand it was therefore considered as invalid by the Spanish jurists. The\r\nfruit of this marriage was a daughter, who had espoused the Elector\r\nof Bavaria. The Electoral Prince of Bavaria inherited her claim to the\r\nthrone of Spain. The Emperor Leopold was son of a daughter of Philip\r\nthe Third, and was therefore first cousin to Charles. No renunciation\r\nwhatever had been exacted from his mother at the time of her marriage.\r\n\r\nThe question was certainly very complicated. That claim which, according\r\nto the ordinary rules of inheritance, was the strongest, had been\r\nbarred by a contract executed in the most binding form. The claim of\r\nthe Electoral Prince of Bavaria was weaker. But so also was the contract\r\nwhich bound him not to prosecute his claim. The only party against whom\r\nno instrument of renunciation could be produced was the party who, in\r\nrespect of blood, had the weakest claim of all.\r\n\r\nAs it was clear that great alarm would be excited throughout Europe if\r\neither the Emperor or the Dauphin should become King of Spain, each of\r\nthose Princes offered to waive his pretensions in favour of his second\r\nson; the Emperor, in favour of the Archduke Charles, the Dauphin, in\r\nfavour of Philip Duke of Anjou.\r\n\r\nSoon after the peace of Ryswick, William the Third and Lewis the\r\nFourteenth determined to settle the question of the succession without\r\nconsulting either Charles or the Emperor. France, England, and Holland,\r\nbecame parties to a treaty by which it was stipulated {90}that the\r\nElectoral Prince of Bavaria should succeed to Spain, the Indies, and\r\nthe Netherlands. The Imperial family were to be bought off with the\r\nMilanese; and the Dauphin was to have the Two Sicilies.\r\n\r\nThe great object of the King of Spain and of all his counsellors was to\r\navert the dismemberment of the monarchy. In the hope of attaining this\r\nend, Charles determined to name a successor. A will was accordingly\r\nframed by which the crown was bequeathed to the Bavarian Prince.\r\nUnhappily, this will had scarcely been signed when the Prince died. The\r\nquestion was again unsettled, and presented greater difficulties than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nA new Treaty of Partition was concluded between France, England, and\r\nHolland. It was agreed that Spain, the Indies, and the Netherlands,\r\nshould descend to the Archduke Charles. In return for this great\r\nconcession made by the Bourbons to a rival house, it was agreed that\r\nFrance should have the Milanese, or an equivalent in a more commodious\r\nsituation. The equivalent in view was the province of Lorraine.\r\n\r\nArbuthnot, some years later, ridiculed the Partition Treaty with\r\nexquisite humour and ingenuity. Everybody must remember his description\r\nof the paroxysm of rage into which poor old Lord Strutt fell, on hearing\r\nthat his runaway servant Nick Frog, his clothier John Bull, and his old\r\nenemy Lewis Baboon, had come with quadrants, poles, and inkhorns, to\r\nsurvey his estate, and to draw his will for him. Lord Mahon speaks\r\nof the arrangement with grave severity. He calls it, “an iniquitous\r\ncompact, concluded without the slightest reference to the welfare of\r\nthe states so readily parcelled and allotted; insulting to the pride of\r\nSpain, {91}and tending to strip that country of its hard-won conquests.”\r\n The most serious part of this charge would apply to half the treaties\r\nwhich have been concluded in Europe quite as strongly as to the\r\nPartition Treaty. What regard was shown in the treaty of the Pyrenees\r\nto the welfare of the people of Dunkirk and Roussillon, in the treaty of\r\nNimeguen to the welfare of the people of Franche Comte, in the treaty of\r\nUtrecht to the welfare of the people of Flanders, in the treaty of 1735\r\nto the welfare of the people of Tuscany? All Europe remembers, and our\r\nlatest posterity will, we fear, have reason to remember how coolly, at\r\nthe last great pacification of Christendom, the people of Poland, of\r\nNorway, of Belgium, and of Lombardy, were allotted to masters whom they\r\nabhorred. The statesmen who negotiated the Partition Treaty were not\r\nso far beyond their age and ours in wisdom and virtue as to trouble\r\nthemselves much about the happiness of the people whom they were\r\napportioning among foreign rulers. But it will be difficult to prove\r\nthat the stipulations which Lord Mahon condemns were in any respect\r\nunfavourable to the happiness of those who were to be transferred to new\r\nsovereigns. The Neapolitans would certainly have lost nothing by being\r\ngiven to the Dauphin, or to the Great Turk. Addison, who visited Naples\r\nabout the time at which the Partition Treaty was signed, has left us a\r\nfrightful description of the misgovernment under which that part of\r\nthe Spanish Empire groaned. As to the people of Lorraine, an union with\r\nFrance would have been the happiest event which could have befallen\r\nthem. Lewis was already their sovereign for all purposes of cruelty and\r\nexaction. He had kept their country during many years in his own hands.\r\nAt the peace of Ryswick, indeed, their {92}Duke had been allowed to\r\nreturn. But the conditions which had been imposed on him made him a mere\r\nvassal of France.\r\n\r\nWe cannot admit that the Treaty of Partition was objectionable because\r\nit “tended to strip Spain of hard-won conquests.” The inheritance was so\r\nvast, and the claimants so mighty, that without some dismemberment\r\nit was scarcely possible to make a peaceable arrangement. If any\r\ndismemberment was to take place, the best way of effecting it surely\r\nwas to separate from the monarchy those provinces which were at a great\r\ndistance from Spain, which were not Spanish in manners, in language, or\r\nin feelings, which were both worse governed and less valuable than\r\nthe old kingdoms of Castile and Arragon, and which, having always\r\nbeen governed by foreigners, would not be likely to feel acutely the\r\nhumiliation of being turned over from one master to another.\r\n\r\nThat England and Holland had a right to interfere is plain. The question\r\nof the Spanish succession was not an internal question, but an European\r\nquestion. And this Lord Mahon admits. He thinks that when the evil had\r\nbeen done, and a French Prince was reigning at the Escurial, England and\r\nHolland were justified in attempting, not merely to strip Spain of\r\nits remote dependencies, but to conquer Spain itself; that they were\r\njustified in attempting to put, not merely the passive Flemings and\r\nItalians, but the reluctant Castilians and Asturians, under the dominion\r\nof a stranger. The danger against which the Partition Treaty was\r\nintended to guard was precisely the same danger which afterwards was\r\nmade the ground of war. It will be difficult to prove that a danger\r\nwhich was sufficient to justify the war was insufficient {93}to justify\r\nthe provisions of the treaty. If, as Lord Mahon contends, it was better\r\nthat Spain should be subjugated by main force than that she should be\r\ngoverned by a Bourbon, it was surely better that she should be deprived\r\nof Sicily and the Milanese than that she should be governed by a\r\nBourbon.\r\n\r\nWhether the treaty was judiciously framed is quite another question. We\r\ndisapprove of the stipulations. But we disapprove of them, not because\r\nwe think them bad, but because we think that there was no chance of\r\ntheir being executed. Lewis was the most faithless of politicians.\r\nHe hated the Dutch. He hated the Government which the Revolution had\r\nestablished in England. He had every disposition to quarrel with his new\r\nallies. It was quite certain that he would not observe his engagements,\r\nif it should be for his interest to violate them. Even if it should be\r\nfor his interest to observe them, it might well be doubted whether\r\nthe strongest and clearest interest would induce a man so haughty and\r\nself-willed to cooperate heartily with two governments which had always\r\nbeen the objects of his scorn and aversion.\r\n\r\nWhen intelligence of the second Partition Treaty arrived at Madrid, it\r\nroused to momentary energy the languishing ruler of a languishing\r\nstate. The Spanish ambassador at the court of London was directed to\r\nremonstrate with the government ef William; and his remonstrances were\r\nso insolent that he was commanded to leave England. Charles retaliated\r\nby dismissing the English and Dutch ambassadors. The French King, though\r\nthe chief author of the Partition Treaty, succeeded in turning the\r\nwhole wrath of Charles and of the Spanish people from himself, and in\r\ndirecting it against the two maritime {94}powers. Those powers had now\r\nno agent at Madrid. Their perfidious ally was at liberty to carry on his\r\nintrigues unchecked; and he fully availed himself of this advantage.\r\n\r\nA long contest was maintained with varying success by the factions which\r\nsurrounded the miserable King. On the side of the Imperial family was\r\nthe Queen, herself a Princess of that family. With her were allied the\r\nconfessor of the King, and most of the ministers. On the other side\r\nwere two of the most dexterous politicians of that age, Cardinal Porto\r\nCarrero, Archbishop of Toledo, and Harcourt the ambassador of Lewis.\r\n\r\nHarcourt was a noble specimen of the French aristocracy in the days\r\nof its highest splendour, a finished gentleman, a brave soldier, and a\r\nskilful diplomatist. His courteous and insinuating manners, his Parisian\r\nvivacity tempered with Castilian gravity, made him the favourite of\r\nthe whole court. He became intimate with the grandees. He caressed the\r\nclergy. He dazzled the multitude by his magnificent style of living.\r\nThe prejudices which the people of Madrid conceived against the French\r\ncharacter, the vindictive feelings generated during centuries of\r\nnational rivalry, gradually yielded to his arts; while the Austrian\r\nambassador, a surly, pompous, niggardly German, made himself and his\r\ncountry more and more unpopular every day.\r\n\r\nHarcourt won over the court and the city: Porto Carrero managed the\r\nKing. Never were knave and dupe better suited to each other. Charles\r\nwas sick, nervous, and extravagantly superstitious. Porto Carrero\r\nhad learned in the exercise of his profession the art of exciting and\r\nsoothing such minds; and he {95}employed that art with the calm and\r\ndemure cruelty which is the characteristic of wicked and ambitious\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nHe first supplanted the confessor. The state of the poor King, during\r\nthe conflict between his two spiritual advisers, was horrible. At one\r\ntime he was induced to believe that his malady was the same with that of\r\nthe wretches described in the New Testament, who dwelt among the tombs,\r\nwhom no chains could bind, and whom no man dared to approach. At\r\nanother time a sorceress who lived in the mountains of the Asturias\r\nwas consulted about his malady. Several persons were accused of having\r\nbewitched him. Porto Carrero recommended the appalling rite of exorcism,\r\nwhich was actually performed. The ceremony made the poor King more\r\nnervous and miserable than ever. But it served the turn of the Cardinal\r\nwho, after much secret trickery, succeeded in casting out, not the\r\ndevil, but the confessor.\r\n\r\nThe next object was to get rid of the Ministers. Madrid was supplied\r\nwith provisions by a monopoly. The government looked after this most\r\ndelicate concern as it looked after every thing else. The partisans\r\nof the House of Bourbon took advantage of the negligence of the\r\nadministration. On a sudden the supply of food failed. Exorbitant prices\r\nwere demanded. The people rose. The royal residence was surrounded by an\r\nimmense multitude. The Queen harangued them. The priests exhibited the\r\nhost. All was in vain. It was necessary to awaken the King from his\r\nuneasy sleep, and to carry him to the balcony. There a solemn promise\r\nwas given that the unpopular advisers of the crown should be forthwith\r\ndismissed. The mob left the palace and proceeded to pull down {96}the\r\nhouses of the ministers. The adherents of the Austrian line were thus\r\ndriven from power, and the government was intrusted to the creatures of\r\nPorto Carrero. The King left the city in which he had suffered so\r\ncruel an insult for the magnificent retreat of the Escurial. Here his\r\nhypochondriac fancy took a new turn. Like his ancestor Charles the\r\nFifth, he was haunted by a strange curiosity to pry into the secrets of\r\nthat grave to which he was hastening. In the cemetery which Philip the\r\nSecond had formed beneath the pavement of the church of St. Lawrence,\r\nreposed three generations of Castilian princes. Into these dark vaults\r\nthe unhappy monarch descended by torch-light, and penetrated to that\r\nsuperb and gloomy chamber where, round the great black crucifix, were\r\nranged the coffins of the kings and queens of Spain. There he commanded\r\nhis attendants to open the massy chests of bronze in which the relics of\r\nhis predecessors decayed. He looked on the ghastly spectacle with little\r\nemotion till the coffin of his first wife was unclosed, and she\r\nappeared before him--such was the skill of the embalmer--in all her\r\nwell-remembered beauty. He cast one glance on those beloved features,\r\nunseen for eighteen years, those features over which corruption seemed\r\nto have no power, and rushed from the vault, exclaiming, “She is with\r\nGod; and I shall soon be with her.” The awful sight completed the\r\nruin of his body and mind. The Escurial became hateful to him; and\r\nhe hastened to Aranjuez. But the shades and waters of that delicious\r\nisland-garden, so fondly celebrated in the sparkling verse of Calderon,\r\nbrought no solace to their unfortunate master. Having tried medicine,\r\nexercise, and amusement in vain, he returned to Madrid to die. {97}He\r\nwas now beset on every side by the bold and skilful agents of the House\r\nof Bourbon. The leading politicians of his court assured him that Lewis,\r\nand Lewis alone, was sufficiently powerful to preserve the Spanish\r\nmonarchy undivided, and that Austria would be utterly unable to prevent\r\nthe Treaty of Partition from being carried into effect. Some celebrated\r\nlawyers gave it as their opinion that the act of renunciation executed\r\nby the late Queen of France ought to be construed according to the\r\nspirit, and not according to the letter. The letter undoubtedly excluded\r\nthe French Princes. The spirit was merely this, that ample security\r\nshould be taken against the union of the French and Spanish crowns on\r\none head.\r\n\r\nIn all probability, neither political nor legal reasonings would have\r\nsufficed to overcome the partiality which Charles felt for the House of\r\nAustria. There had always been a close connection between the two great\r\nroyal lines which sprang from the marriage of Philip and Juana. Both had\r\nalways regarded the French as their natural enemies. It was necessary\r\nto have recourse to religious terrors; and Porto Carrero employed those\r\nterrors with true professional skill. The King’s life was drawing to a\r\nclose. Would the most Catholic prince commit a great sin on the brink\r\nof the grave? And what could be a greater sin than, from an unreasonable\r\nattachment to a family name, from an unchristian antipathy to a rival\r\nhouse, to set aside the rightful heir of an immense monarchy? The tender\r\nconscience and the feeble intellect of Charles were strongly\r\nwrought upon by these appeals. At length Porto Carrero ventured on a\r\nmaster-stroke. He advised Charles to apply for counsel to the Pope. The\r\nKing who, in the simplicity of his heart, considered {98}the successor\r\nof St. Peter as an infallible guide in spiritual matters, adopted the\r\nsuggestion; and Porto Carrero, who knew that his Holiness was a mere\r\ntool of France, awaited with perfect confidence the result of the\r\napplication. In the answer which arrived from Rome, the King was\r\nsolemnly reminded of the great account which he was soon to render, and\r\ncautioned against the flagrant injustice which he was tempted to\r\ncommit. He was assured that the right was with the House of Bourbon, and\r\nreminded that his own salvation ought to be dearer to him than the House\r\nof Austria. Yet he still continued irresolute. His attachment to his\r\nfamily, his aversion to France, were not to be overcome even by Papal\r\nauthority. At length he thought himself actually dying. Then the\r\ncardinal redoubled his efforts. Divine after divine, well tutored for\r\nthe occasion, was brought to the bed of the trembling penitent. He was\r\ndying in the commission of known sin. He was defrauding his relatives.\r\nHe was bequeathing civil war to his people. He yielded, and signed\r\nthat memorable Testament, the cause of many calamities to Europe. As he\r\naffixed his name to the instrument, he burst into tears. “God,” he said,\r\n“gives kingdoms and takes them away. I am already one of the dead.”\r\n\r\nThe will was kept secret during the short remainder of his life. On the\r\nthird of November 1700 he expired. All Madrid crowded to the palace.\r\nThe gates were thronged. The antechamber was filled with ambassadors and\r\ngrandees, eager to learn what dispositions the deceased sovereign had\r\nmade. At length the folding doors were flung open. The Duke of Abrantes\r\ncame forth, and announced that the whole Spanish monarchy was bequeathed\r\nto Philip Duke of Anjou. {99}Charles had directed that, during the\r\ninterval which might elapse between his death and the arrival of his\r\nsuccessor, the government should be administered by a council, of which\r\nPorto Carrero was the chief member.\r\n\r\nLewis acted, as the English ministers might have guessed that he would\r\nact. With scarcely the show of hesitation, he broke through all the\r\nobligations of the Partition Treaty, and accepted for his grandson\r\nthe splendid legacy of Charles. The new sovereign hastened to take\r\npossession of his dominions. The whole court of France accompanied him\r\nto Sceaux. His brothers escorted him to that frontier which, as they\r\nweakly imagined, was to be a frontier no longer. “The Pyrenees,” said\r\nLewis, “have ceased to exist.” Those very Pyrenees, a few years later,\r\nwere the theatre of a war between the heir of Lewis and the prince whom\r\nFrance was now sending to govern Spain.\r\n\r\nIf Charles had ransacked Europe to find a successor whose moral and\r\nintellectual character resembled his own, he could not have chosen\r\nbetter. Philip was not so sickly as his predecessor, but he was quite\r\nas weak, as indolent, and as superstitious; he very soon became quite\r\nas hypochondriacal and eccentric; and he was even more uxorious. He was\r\nindeed a husband of ten thousand. His first object when he became King\r\nof Spain, was to procure a wife. From the day of his marriage to the day\r\nof her death, his first object was to have her near him, and to do what\r\nshe wished. As soon as his wife died his first object was to procure\r\nanother. Another was found as unlike the former as possible. But she was\r\na wife; and Philip was content. Neither by day nor by night, neither\r\nin sickness nor in health, neither in time of business nor in time of\r\nrelaxation, did he ever suffer her to be absent from him for {100}half\r\nan hour. His mind was naturally feeble; and he had received an\r\nenfeebling education; he had been brought up amidst the dull\r\nmagnificence of Versailles. His grandfather was as imperious and as\r\nostentatious in his intercourse with the royal family as in public acts.\r\nAll those who grew up immediately under the eye of Lewis had the manners\r\nof persons who had never known what it was to be at ease. They were all\r\ntaciturn, shy, and awkward. In all of them, except the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nthe evil went further than the manners. The Dauphin, the Duke of Berri,\r\nPhilip of Anjou, were men of insignificant characters. They had no\r\nenergy, no force of will. They had been so little accustomed to judge or\r\nto act for themselves that implicit dependence had become necessary\r\nto their comfort. The new King of Spain, emancipated from control,\r\nresembled that wretched German captive who, when the irons which he\r\nhad worn for years were knocked off, fell prostrate on the floor of his\r\nprison. The restraints which had enfeebled the mind of the young Prince\r\nwere required to support it. Till he had a wife he could do nothing; and\r\nwhen he had a wife he did whatever she chose.\r\n\r\nWhile this lounging, moping boy was on his way to Madrid, his\r\ngrandfather was all activity. Lewis had no reason to fear a contest\r\nwith the Empire singlehanded. He made vigorous preparations to encounter\r\nLeopold. He overawed the States-General by means of a great army. He\r\nattempted to soothe the English government by fair professions. William\r\nwas not deceived. He fully returned the hatred of Lewis and, if he\r\nhad been free to act according to his own inclinations, he would have\r\ndeclared war as soon as the contents of the will were known. But he\r\nwas bound {101}by constitutional restraints. Both his person and his\r\nmeasures were unpopular in England. His secluded life and his cold\r\nmanners disgusted a people accustomed to the graceful affability of\r\nCharles the Second. His foreign accent and his foreign attachments were\r\noffensive to the national prejudices. His reign had been a season of\r\ndistress, following a season of rapidly increasing prosperity. The\r\nburdens of the late war and the expense of restoring the currency had\r\nbeen severely felt. Nine clergymen out of ten were Jacobites at heart,\r\nand had sworn allegiance to the new dynasty, only in order to save their\r\nbenefices. A large proportion of the country gentlemen belonged to the\r\nsame party. The whole body of agricultural proprietors was hostile to\r\nthat interest which the creation of the national debt had brought into\r\nnotice, and which was believed to be peculiarly favoured by the Court,\r\nthe monied interest. The middle classes were fully determined to keep\r\nout James and his family. But they regarded William only as the less\r\nof two evils; and as long as there was no imminent danger of a\r\ncounter-revolution, were disposed to thwart and mortify the sovereign by\r\nwhom they were, nevertheless, ready to stand, in case of necessity,\r\nwith their lives and fortunes. They were sullen and dissatisfied.\r\n“There was,” as Somers expressed it in a remarkable letter to William,\r\n“a deadness and want of spirit in the nation universally.” Every thing in\r\nEngland was going on as Lewis could have wished. The leaders of the Whig\r\nparty had retired from power, and were extremely unpopular on account of\r\nthe unfortunate issue of the Partition Treaty. The Tories, some of whom\r\nstill cast a lingering look towards St. Germain’s, were in office, and\r\nhad a decided majority in the House of Commons. William {102}was so much\r\nembarrassed by the state of parties in England that he could not\r\nventure to make war on the House of Bourbon. He was suffering under a\r\ncomplication of severe and incurable diseases. There was every reason to\r\nbelieve that a few months would dissolve the fragile tie which bound up\r\nthat feeble body with that ardent and unconquerable soul. If Lewis could\r\nsucceed in preserving peace for a short time, it was probable that all\r\nhis vast designs would be securely accomplished. Just at this crisis,\r\nthe most important crisis of his life, his pride and his passions\r\nhurried him into an error, which undid all that forty years of victory\r\nand intrigue had done, which produced the dismemberment of the kingdom\r\nof his grandson, and brought invasion, bankruptcy, and famine on his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nJames the Second died at St. Germain’s. Lewis paid him a farewell visit,\r\nand was so much moved by the solemn parting, and by the grief of the\r\nexiled queen, that, losing sight of all considerations of policy,\r\nand actuated, as it should seem, merely by compassion and by a not\r\nungenerous vanity, he acknowledged the Prince of Wales as King of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe indignation which the Castilians had felt when they heard that three\r\nforeign powers had undertaken to regulate the Spanish succession was\r\nnothing to the rage with which the English learned that their good\r\nneighbour had taken the trouble to provide them with a king. Whigs and\r\nTories joined in condemning the proceedings of the French Court. The cry\r\nfor war was raised by the city of London, and echoed and reechoed from\r\nevery corner of the realm. William saw that his time was come. Though\r\nhis wasted and suffering body could hardly move without support, his\r\nspirit was as energetic and resolute as when, {103}at twenty-three, he\r\nbade defiance to the combined forces of England and France. He left the\r\nHague, where he had been engaged in negotiating with the States and\r\nthe Emperor a defensive treaty against the ambitious designs of the\r\nBourbons. He flew to London. He remodelled the ministry. He dissolved\r\nthe Parliament. The majority of the new House of Commons was with the\r\nKing; and the most vigorous preparations were made for war.\r\n\r\nBefore the commencement of active hostilities William was no more. But\r\nthe Grand Alliance of the European Princes against the Bourbons was\r\nalready constructed. “The master workman died,” says Mr. Burke; “but\r\nthe work was formed on true mechanical principles, and it was as truly\r\nwrought.” On the fifteenth of May, 1702, war was proclaimed by concert\r\nat Vienna, at London, and at the Hague.\r\n\r\nThus commenced that great struggle by which Europe, from the Vistula to\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, was agitated during twelve years. The two hostile\r\ncoalitions were, in respect of territory, wealth, and population, not\r\nunequally matched. On the one side were France, Spain, and Bavaria; on\r\nthe other England, Holland, the Empire, and a crowd of inferior Powers.\r\n\r\nThat part of the war which Lord Mahon has undertaken to relate; though\r\nnot the least important, is certainly the least attractive. In Italy,\r\nin Germany, and in the Netherlands, great means were at the disposal of\r\ngreat generals. Mighty battles were fought. Fortress after fortress\r\nwas subdued. The iron chain of the Belgian strongholds was broken. By\r\na regular and connected series of operations extending through several\r\nyears, the French were driven back from the Danube and the Po into their\r\nown provinces. The {104}war in Spain, on the contrary, is made up of\r\nevents which seem to have no dependence on each other. The turns of\r\nfortune resemble those which take place in a dream. Victory and defeat\r\nare not followed by their usual consequences. Armies spring out of\r\nnothing, and melt into nothing. Yet, to judicious readers of history,\r\nthe Spanish conflict is perhaps more interesting than the campaigns\r\nof Marlborough and Eugene. The fate of the Milanese and of the Low\r\nCountries was decided by military skill. The fate of Spain was decided\r\nby the peculiarities of the national character.\r\n\r\nWhen the war commenced, the young King was in a most deplorable\r\nsituation. On his arrival at Madrid he found Porto Carrero at the head\r\nof affairs, and he did not think fit to displace the man to whom he\r\nowed his crown. The cardinal was a mere intriguer, and in no sense a\r\nstatesman. He had acquired, in the Court and in the Confessional, a rare\r\ndegree of skill in all the tricks by which weak minds are managed.\r\nBut of the noble science of government, of the sources of national\r\nprosperity, of the causes of national decay, he knew no more than his\r\nmaster. It is curious to observe the contrast between the dexterity\r\nwith which he ruled the conscience of a foolish valetudinarian, and the\r\nimbecility which he showed when placed at the head of an empire. On\r\nwhat grounds Lord Mahon represents the Cardinal as a man “of splendid\r\ngenius,” “of vast abilities,” we are unable to discover. Lewis was of\r\na very different opinion, and Lewis was very seldom mistaken in his\r\njudgment of character. “Every body,” says he, in a letter to his\r\nambassador, “knows how incapable the Cardinal is. He is an object of\r\ncontempt to his countrymen.”\r\n\r\nA few miserable savings were made, which ruined {105}individuals without\r\nproducing any perceptible benefit to the state. The police became more\r\nand more inefficient. The disorders of the capital were increased by\r\nthe arrival of French adventurers, the refuse of Parisian brothels and\r\ngaming-houses. These wretches considered the Spaniards as a subjugated\r\nrace whom the countrymen of the new sovereign might cheat and insult\r\nwith impunity. The King sate eating and drinking all night, lay in bed\r\nall day, yawned at the council table, and suffered the most important\r\npapers to lie unopened for weeks. At length he was roused by the only\r\nexcitement of which his sluggish nature was susceptible. His grandfather\r\nconsented to let him have a wife. The choice was fortunate. Maria\r\nLouisa, Princess of Savoy, a beautiful and graceful girl of thirteen,\r\nalready a woman in person and mind, at the age when the females of\r\ncolder climates are still children, was the person selected. The King\r\nresolved to give her the meeting in Catalonia. He left his capital, of\r\nwhich he was already thoroughly tired. At setting out he was mobbed by a\r\ngang of beggars. He, however, made his way through them, and repaired to\r\nBarcelona.\r\n\r\nLewis was perfectly aware that the Queen would govern Philip. He,\r\naccordingly, looked about for somebody to govern the Queen. He selected\r\nthe Princess Orsini to be first lady of the bedchamber, no insignificant\r\npost in the household of a very young wife, and a very uxorious husband.\r\nThe princess was the daughter of a French peer, and the widow of a\r\nSpanish grandee. She was, therefore, admirably fitted by her position to\r\nbe the instrument of the Court of Versailles at the Court of Madrid.\r\nThe Duke of Orleans called her, in words too coarse for translation,\r\nthe Lieutenant of Captain Maintenon; and the appellation {106}was\r\nwell deserved. She aspired to play in Spain the part which Madame de\r\nMaintenon had played in France. But, though at least equal to her\r\nmodel in wit, information, and talents for intrigue, she had not that\r\nself-command, that patience, that imperturbable evenness of temper,\r\nwhich had raised the widow of a buffoon to be the consort of the\r\nproudest of kings. The Princess was more than fifty years old, but was\r\nstill vain of her fine eyes, and her fine shape; she still dressed in\r\nthe style of a girl; and she still carried her flirtations so far as to\r\ngive occasion for scandal. She was, however, polite, eloquent, and\r\nnot deficient in strength of mind. The bitter Saint Simon owns that no\r\nperson whom she wished to attach could long resist the graces of her\r\nmanners and of her conversation.\r\n\r\nWe have not time to relate how she obtained, and how she preserved her\r\nempire over the young couple in whose household she was placed, how she\r\nbecame so powerful, that neither minister of Spain nor ambassador from\r\nFrance could stand against her, how Lewis himself was compelled to court\r\nher, how she received orders from Versailles to retire, how the Queen\r\ntook part with her favourite attendant, how the King took part with the\r\nQueen, and how, after much squabbling, lying, shuffling, bullying, and\r\ncoaxing, the dispute was adjusted. We turn to the events of the war.\r\n\r\nWhen hostilities were proclaimed at London, Vienna, and the Hague,\r\nPhilip was at Naples. He had been with great difficulty prevailed upon,\r\nby the most urgent representations from Versailles, to separate himself\r\nfrom his wife, and to repair without her to his Italian dominions, which\r\nwere then menaced by the Emperor. The Queen acted as Regent, and, child\r\nas she was, seems to {107}have been quite as competent to govern the\r\nkingdom as her husband or any of his ministers.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1702, an armament, under the command of the Duke of Ormond,\r\nappeared off Cadiz. The Spanish authorities had no funds and no regular\r\ntroops. The national spirit, however, supplied in some degree what\r\nwas wanting. The nobles and farmers advanced money. The peasantry were\r\nformed into what the Spanish writers call bands of heroic patriots, and\r\nwhat General Stanhope calls a “rascally foot militia.” If the invaders\r\nhad acted with vigour and judgment, Cadiz would probably have\r\nfallen. But the chiefs of the expedition were divided by national and\r\nprofessional feelings, Dutch against English, and land against sea.\r\nSparre, the Dutch general, was sulky and perverse. Bellasys, the English\r\ngeneral, embezzled the stores. Lord Mahon imputes the ill temper of\r\nSparre to the influence of the republican institutions of Holland. By\r\nparity of reason, we suppose that he would impute the peculations\r\nof Bellasys to the influence of the monarchical and aristocratical\r\ninstitutions of England. The Duke of Ormond, who had the command of the\r\nwhole expedition, proved on this occasion, as on every other, destitute\r\nof the qualities which great emergencies require. No discipline was\r\nkept; the soldiers were suffered to rob and insult those whom it was\r\nmost desirable to conciliate. Churches were robbed; images were pulled\r\ndown; nuns were violated. The officers shared the spoil instead of\r\npunishing the spoilers; and at last the armament, loaded, to use the\r\nwords of Stanhope, “with a great deal of plunder and infamy,” quitted\r\nthe scene of Essex’s glory, leaving the only Spaniard of note who had\r\ndeclared for them to be hanged by his countrymen. {108}The fleet was\r\noff the coast of Portugal on the way back to England, when the Duke of\r\nOrmond received intelligence that the treasure ships from America\r\nhad just arrived in Europe, and had, in order to avoid his armament,\r\nrepaired to the harbour of Vigo. The cargo consisted, it was said, of\r\nmore than three millions sterling tin gold and silver, besides much\r\nvaluable merchandise. The prospect of plunder reconciled all disputes.\r\nDutch and English, admirals and generals, were equally eager for action.\r\nThe Spaniards might with the greatest ease have secured the treasure by\r\nsimply landing it; but it was a fundamental law of Spanish trade that\r\nthe galleons should unload at Cadiz, and at Cadiz only. The Chamber of\r\nCommerce at Cadiz, in the true spirit of monopoly, refused, even at this\r\nconjuncture, to bate one jot of its privilege. The matter was referred\r\nto the Council of the Indies. That body deliberated and hesitated just a\r\nday too long. Some feeble preparations for defence were made. Two\r\nruined towers at the mouth of the bay of Vigo were garrisoned by a few\r\nill-armed and untrained rustics; a boom was thrown across the entrance\r\nof the basin; and a few French ships of war, which had convoyed the\r\ngalleons from America, were moored within. But all was to no purpose.\r\nThe English ships broke the boom; Ormond and his soldiers scaled the\r\nforts; the French burned their ships, and escaped to the shore. The\r\nconquerors shared some millions of dollars; some millions more were\r\nsunk. When all the galleons had been captured or destroyed came an order\r\nin due form allowing them to unload.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip returned to Madrid in the beginning of 1703, he found the\r\nfinances more embarrassed, the people more discontented, and the hostile\r\ncoalition more {109}formidable than ever. The loss of the galleons had\r\noccasioned a great deficiency in the revenue. The Admiral of Castile,\r\none of the greatest subjects in Europe, had fled to Lisbon and sworn\r\nallegiance to the Archduke. The King of Portugal soon after acknowledged\r\nCharles as King of Spain, and prepared to support the title of the House\r\nof Austria by arms.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Lewis sent to the assistance of his grandson an army\r\nof 12,000 men, commanded by the Duke of Berwick. Berwick was the son\r\nof James the Second and Arabella Churchill. He had been brought up to\r\nexpect the highest honours which an English subject could enjoy; but the\r\nwhole course of his life was changed by the revolution which overthrew\r\nhis infatuated father. Berwick became an exile, a man without a country;\r\nand from that time forward his camp was to him in the place of a\r\ncountry, and professional honour was his patriotism. He ennobled his\r\nwretched calling. There was a stern, cold, Brutus-like virtue in the\r\nmanner in which he discharged the duties of a soldier of fortune. His\r\nmilitary fidelity was tried by the strongest temptations, and was found\r\ninvincible. At one time he fought against his uncle: at another time he\r\nfought against the cause of his brother; yet he was never suspected of\r\ntreachery, or even of slackness.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1704, an army composed of English, Dutch, and Portuguese, was\r\nassembled on the western frontier of Spain. The Archduke Charles had\r\narrived at Lisbon, and appeared in person at the head of his troops. The\r\nmilitary skill of Berwick held the Allies, who were commanded by Lord\r\nGalway, in check through the whole campaign. On the south, however, a\r\ngreat blow was struck. An English fleet, under Sir George Rooke,\r\nhaving on board several regiments commanded {110}by the Prince of\r\nHesse Darmstadt, appeared before the rock of Gibraltar. That celebrated\r\nstronghold, which nature has made all but impregnable, and against which\r\nall the resources of the military art have been employed in vain,\r\nwas taken as easily as if it had been an open village in a plain. The\r\ngarrison went to say their prayers instead of standing on their guard. A\r\nfew English sailors climbed the rock. The Spaniards capitulated; and the\r\nBritish flag was placed on those ramparts from which the combined armies\r\nand navies of France and Spain have never been able to pull it down.\r\nRooke proceeded to Malaga, gave battle in the neighbourhood of that port\r\nto a French squadron, and after a doubtful action returned to England.\r\n\r\nBut greater events were at hand. The English government had determined\r\nto send an expedition to Spain, under the command of Charles Mordaunt\r\nEarl of Peterborough. This man was, if not the greatest, yet assuredly\r\nthe most extraordinary character of that age, the King of Sweden himself\r\nnot excepted. Indeed, Peterborough maybe described as a polite,\r\nlearned and amorous Charles the Twelfth. His courage had all the French\r\nimpetuosity, and all the English steadiness. His fertility and activity\r\nof mind were almost beyond belief. They appeared in every thing that\r\nhe did, in his campaigns, in his negotiations, in his familiar\r\ncorrespondence, in his lightest and most unstudied conversation. He was\r\na kind friend, a generous enemy, and in deportment a thorough gentleman.\r\nBut his splendid talents and virtues were rendered almost useless to his\r\ncountry, by his levity, his restlessness, his irritability, his morbid\r\ncraving for novelty and for excitement. His weaknesses had not only\r\nbrought him, on more than one occasion, into serious trouble; but had\r\n{111}impelled him to some actions altogether unworthy of his humane and\r\nnoble nature. Repose was insupportable to him. He loved to fly round\r\nEurope faster than a travelling courier. He was at the Hague one week,\r\nat Vienna the next. Then he took a fancy to see Madrid; and he had\r\nscarcely reached Madrid, when he ordered horses and set off for\r\nCopenhagen. No attendants could keep up with his speed. No bodily\r\ninfirmities could confine him. Old age, disease, imminent death,\r\nproduced scarcely any effect on his intrepid spirit. Just before he\r\nunderwent the most horrible of surgical operations, his conversation was\r\nas sprightly as that of a young man in the full vigour of health. On\r\nthe day after the operation, in spite of the entreaties of his medical\r\nadvisers, he would set out on a journey. His figure was that of\r\na skeleton. But his elastic mind supported him under fatigues and\r\nsufferings which seemed sufficient to bring the most robust man to the\r\ngrave. Change of employment was as necessary to him as change of place.\r\nHe loved to dictate six or seven letters at once. Those who had to\r\ntransact business with him complained that though he talked with great\r\nability on every subject, he could never be kept to the point. “Lord\r\nPeterborough,” said Pope, “would say very pretty and lively things in\r\nhis letters, but they would be rather too gay and wandering; whereas,\r\nwere Lord Bolingbroke to write to an emperor, or to a statesman, he\r\nwould fix on that point which was the most material, would set it in\r\nthe strongest and finest light, and manage it so as to make it the most\r\nserviceable to his purpose.” What Peterborough was to Bolingbroke as a\r\nwriter, he was to Marlborough as a general. He was, in truth, the\r\nlast of the knights-errant, brave to temerity, liberal to profusion,\r\ncourteous {112}in his dealings with enemies, the protector of the\r\noppressed, the adorer of women. His virtues and vices were those of the\r\nRound Table. Indeed, his character can hardly be better summed up, than\r\nin the lines in which the author of that clever little poem, _Monks and\r\nGiants_, has described Sir Tristram.\r\n\r\n                   “His birth, it seems, by Merlin’s calculation,\r\n\r\n                   Was under Venus, Mercury, and Mars;\r\n\r\n                   His mind with all their attributes was mixed,\r\n\r\n                   And, like those planets, wandering and unfixed.\r\n\r\n                   “From realm to realm he ran, and never staid:\r\n\r\n                   Kingdoms and crowns he won, and gave away:\r\n\r\n                   It seemed as if his labours were repaid\r\n\r\n                   By the mere noise and movement of the fray:\r\n\r\n                   No conquests nor acquirements had he made;\r\n\r\n                   His chief delight was, on some festive day\r\n\r\n                   To ride triumphant-, prodigal, and proud,\r\n\r\n                   And shower his wealth amidst the shouting crowd.\r\n\r\n                   “His schemes of war were sudden, unforeseen,\r\n\r\n                   Inexplicable, both to friend and foe;\r\n\r\n                   It seemed as if some momentary spleen\r\n\r\n                   Inspired the project and impelled the blow;\r\n\r\n                   And most his fortune and success were seen\r\n\r\n                   With means the most inadequate and low;\r\n\r\n                   Most master of himself, and least encumbered,\r\n\r\n                   When overmatched, entangled and outnumbered.”\r\n\r\nIn June, 1705, this remarkable man arrived in Lisbon with five thousand\r\nDutch and English soldiers. There the Archduke embarked with a large\r\ntrain of attendants, whom Peterborough entertained munificently during\r\nthe voyage at his own expense. From Lisbon the armament proceeded to\r\nGibraltar, and, having taken the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt on board,\r\nsteered towards the north-east alone the coast of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe first place at which the expedition touched, {113}after leaving\r\nGibraltar, was Alter, in Valencia. The wretched misgovernment of Philip\r\nhad excited great discontent throughout this province. The invaders\r\nwere eagerly welcomed. The peasantry flocked to the shore, bearing\r\nprovisions, and shouting, “Long live Charles the Third.” The\r\nneighbouring fortress of Dénia surrendered without a blow.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of Peterborough took fire. He conceived the hope of\r\nfinishing the war at one blow. Madrid was but a hundred and fifty miles\r\ndistant. There was scarcely one fortified place on the road. The troops\r\nof Philip were either on the frontiers of Portugal or on the coast of\r\nCatalonia. At the capital there was no military force, except a few\r\nhorse who formed a guard of honour round the person of Philip. But the\r\nscheme of pushing into the heart of a great kingdom with an army of only\r\nseven thousand men, was too daring to please the Archduke. The Prince of\r\nHesse Darmstadt, who, in the reign of the late Kino-of Spain, had been\r\nGovernor of Catalonia, and who overrated his own influence in that\r\nprovince, was of opinion that they ought instantly to proceed thither,\r\nand to attack Barcelona. Peterborough was hampered by his instructions,\r\nand found it necessary to submit.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of August the fleet arrived before Barcelona; and\r\nPeterborough found that the task assigned to him by the Archduke and the\r\nPrince was one of almost insuperable difficulty. One side of the city\r\nwas protected by the sea; the other by the strong fortifications of\r\nMonjuich. The walls were so extensive that thirty thousand men would\r\nscarcely have been sufficient to invest them. The garrison was as\r\nnumerous as the besieging army. The best officers in the Spanish service\r\nwere in the town. The hopes {114}which the Prince of Darmstadt had\r\nformed of a gen-end rising in Catalonia, were grievously disappointed.\r\nThe invaders were joined only by about fifteen hundred armed peasants,\r\nwhose services cost more than they were worth.\r\n\r\nNo general was ever in a more deplorable situation than that in which\r\nPeterborough was now placed, he had always objected to the scheme\r\nof besieging Barcelona. His objections had been overruled. He had to\r\nexecute a project which he had constantly represented as impracticable.\r\nHis camp was divided into hostile factions, and he was censured by all.\r\nThe Archduke and the Prince blamed him for not proceeding instantly to\r\ntake the town; but suggested no plan by which seven thousand men could\r\nbe enabled to do the work of thirty thousand. Others blamed their\r\ngeneral for giving up his own opinion to the childish whims of\r\nCharles, and for sacrificing his men in an attempt to perform what was\r\nimpossible. The Dutch commander positively declared that his soldiers\r\nshould not stir: Lord Peterborough might give what orders he chose; but\r\nto engage in such a siege was madness; and the men should not be sent to\r\ncertain death where there was no chance of obtaining any advantage.\r\n\r\nAt length, after three weeks of inaction, Peterborough announced his\r\nfixed determination to raise the siege. The heavy cannon were sent on\r\nboard. Preparations were made for reembarking the troops. Charles and\r\nthe Prince of Hesse were furious; but most of the officers blamed their\r\ngeneral for having delayed so long the measure which he had at last\r\nfound it necessary to take. On the 12th of September there were\r\nrejoicings and public entertainments in Barcelona for this great\r\ndeliverance. On the following morning {115}the English flag was flying\r\non the ramparts of Monjuich.\r\n\r\nThe genius and energy of one man had supplied the place of forty\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nAt midnight Peterborough had called on the Prince of Hesse, with whom\r\nhe had not for some time been on speaking terms. “I have resolved, sir,”\r\n said the Earl, “to attempt an assault; you may accompany us if you think\r\nfit, and see whether I and my men deserve what you have been pleased to\r\nsay of us.” The Prince was startled. The attempt, he said, was hopeless,\r\nbut he was ready to take his share; and, without further discussion, he\r\ncalled for his horse.\r\n\r\nFifteen hundred English soldiers were assembled under the Earl. A\r\nthousand more had been posted as a body of reserve at a neighbouring\r\nconvent, under the command of Stanhope. After a winding march along the\r\nfoot of the hills, Peterborough and his little army reached the walls\r\nof Monjuich. There they halted till daybreak. As soon as they were\r\ndescried, the enemy advanced into the outer ditch to meet them. This was\r\nthe event on which Peterborough had reckoned, and for which his men were\r\nprepared. The English received the fire, rushed forward, leaped into the\r\nditch, put the Spaniards to flight, and entered the works together\r\nwith the fugitives. Before the garrison had recovered from their first\r\nsurprise, the Earl was master of the outworks, had taken several pieces\r\nof cannon, and had thrown up a breastwork to defend his men. He\r\nthen sent off for Stanhope’s reserve. While he was waiting for this\r\nreinforcement, news arrived that three thousand men were marching from\r\nBarcelona towards Monjuich. He instantly rode out to take a view of\r\nthem; but no sooner had he left his troops than they were seized with\r\na panic. Their situation {116}was indeed full of danger; they had been\r\nbrought into Monjuich they scarcely knew how; their numbers were\r\nsmall: their general was gone: their hearts failed them, and they were\r\nproceeding to evacuate the fort. Peterborough received information of\r\nthese, occurrences in time to stop the retreat. He galloped up to the\r\nfugitives, addressed a few words to them, and put himself at their head.\r\nThe sound of his voice and the sight of his face restored all their\r\ncourage, and they marched back to their former position.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Hesse had fallen in the confusion of the assault; but\r\nevery thing else went well. Stanhope arrived; the detachment which had\r\ninarched out of Barcelona retreated; the heavy cannon were disembarked,\r\nand brought to bear on the inner fortifications of Monjuich, which\r\nspeedily fell. Peterborough, with his usual generosity, rescued the\r\nSpanish soldiers from the ferocity of his victorious army, and paid the\r\nlast honours with great pomp to his rival the Prince of Hesse.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of Monjuich was the first of a series of brilliant\r\nexploits. Barcelona fell; and Peterborough had the glory of taking, with\r\na handful of men, one of the largest and strongest towns of Europe. He\r\nhad also the glory, not less dear to his chivalrous temper, of saving\r\nthe life and honour of the beautiful Duchess of Popoli, whom he met\r\nflying with dishevelled hair from the fury of the soldiers. He availed\r\nhimself dexterously of the jealousy with which the Catalonians regarded\r\nthe inhabitants of Castile. He guaranteed to the province in the capital\r\nof which he was now quartered all its ancient rights and liberties,\r\nand thus succeeded in attaching the population to the Austrian cause.\r\n{117}The open country now declared in favour of Charles. Tarragona,\r\nTortosa, Gerona, Lerida, San Mateo, threw open their gates. The Spanish\r\ngovernment sent the Count of Las Torres with seven thousand men to\r\nreduce San Mateo. The Earl of Peterborough, with only twelve hundred\r\nmen, raised the siege. His officers advised him to be content with this\r\nextraordinary success. Charles urged him to return to Barcelona; but no\r\nremonstrances could stop such a spirit in the midst of such a career.\r\nIt was the depth of winter. The country was mountainous. The roads were\r\nalmost impassable. The men were ill-clothed. The horses were knocked up.\r\nThe retreating army was far more numerous than the pursuing army. But\r\ndifficulties and dangers vanished before the energy of Peterborough. He\r\npushed on, driving Las Torres before him. Nules surrendered to the mere\r\nterror of his name; and, on the fourth of February, 1706, he arrived in\r\ntriumph at Valencia. There he learned that a body of four thousand men\r\nwas on the march to join Las Torres. He set out at dead of night from\r\nValencia, passed the Xucar, came unexpectedly on the encampment of the\r\nenemy, and slaughtered, dispersed, or took the whole reinforcement. The\r\nValencians could scarcely believe their eyes when they saw the prisoners\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Courts of Madrid and Versailles, exasperated and\r\nalarmed by the fall of Barcelona and by the revolt of the surrounding\r\ncountry, determined to make a great effort. A large army, nominally\r\ncommanded by Philip, but really under the orders of Marshal Tessé,\r\nentered Catalonia. A fleet under the Count of Toulouse, one of the\r\nnatural children of Lewis the Fourteenth, appeared before the port\r\nof Barcelona. {118}The city was attacked at once by sea and land. The\r\nperson of the Archduke was in considerable danger. Peterborough, at\r\nthe head of about three thousand men, inarched with great rapidity from\r\nValencia. To give battle, with so small a force, to a great regular army\r\nunder the conduct of a Marshal of France, would have been madness. The\r\nEarl therefore made war after the fashion of the Minas and Empecinados\r\nof our own time. He took his post on the neighbouring mountains,\r\nharassed the enemy with incessant alarms, cut off their stragglers,\r\nintercepted their communications with the interior, and introduced\r\nsupplies, both of men and provisions into the town. He saw, however,\r\nthat the only hope of the besieged was on the side of the sea. His\r\ncommission from the British government gave him supreme power, not only\r\nover the army, but, whenever he should be actually on board, over\r\nthe navy also. He put out to sea at night in an open boat, without\r\ncommunicating his design to any person. He was picked up, several\r\nleagues from the shore, by one of the ships of the English squadron. As\r\nsoon as he was on board, he announced himself as first in command, and\r\nsent a pinnace with his orders to the Admiral. Had these orders been\r\ngiven a few hours earlier, it is probable that the whole French fleet\r\nwould have been taken. As it was, the Count of Toulouse put out to sea.\r\nThe port was open. The town was relieved. On the following night\r\nthe enemy raised the siege and retreated to Roussillon. Peterborough\r\nreturned to Valencia, a place which he preferred to every other in\r\nSpain; and Philip, who had been some weeks absent from his wife, could\r\nendure the misery of separation no longer, and flew to rejoin her at\r\nMadrid.\r\n\r\nAt Madrid, however, it was impossible for him or for {119}her to remain.\r\nThe splendid success which Peterborough had obtained on the eastern\r\ncoast of the Peninsula had inspired the sluggish Galway with emulation.\r\nHe advanced into the heart of Spain. Berwick retreated. Alcantara,\r\nCiudad Rodrigo, and Salamanca fell, and the conquerors marched towards\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\nPhilip was earnestly pressed by his advisers to remove the seat of\r\ngovernment to Burgos. The advanced guard of the allied army was already\r\nseen on the heights above Madrid. It was known that the main body was at\r\nhand. The unfortunate Prince fled with his Queen and his household.\r\nThe royal wanderers, after travelling eight days on bad roads, under a\r\nburning sun, and sleeping eight nights in miserable hovels, one of which\r\nfell down and nearly crushed them both to death, reached the Metropolis\r\nof Old Castile. In the mean time the invaders had entered Madrid in\r\ntriumph, and had proclaimed the Archduke in the streets of the imperial\r\ncity. Arragon, ever jealous of the Castilian ascendency, followed the\r\nexample of Catalonia. Saraoossa revolted without seeing an enemy. The\r\ngovernor whom Philip had set over Carthagena betrayed his trust, and\r\nsurrendered to the Allies the best arsenal and the last ships which\r\nSpain possessed.\r\n\r\nToledo had been for some time the retreat of two ambitious, turbulent,\r\nand vindictive intriguers, the Queen Dowager and Cardinal Porto Carrero.\r\nThey had long been deadly enemies. They had led the adverse factions\r\nof Austria and France. Each had in turn domineered over the weak and\r\ndisordered mind of the late King. At length the impostures of the priest\r\nhad triumphed over the blandishments of the woman; Porto Carrero had\r\nremained victorious; and the Queen had fled in shame and mortification,\r\nfrom the court where {120}she had once been supreme. In her retirement\r\nshe was soon joined by him whose arts had destroyed her influence. The\r\ncardinal, having held power just long enough to convince all parties of\r\nhis incompetency, had been dismissed to his See, cursing his own folly\r\nand the ingratitude of the House which he had served too well.\r\n\r\nCommon interests and common enmities reconciled the fallen rivals. The\r\nAustrian troops were admitted into Toledo without opposition. The Queen\r\nDowager flung off that mournful garb which the widow of a King of Spain\r\nwears through her whole life, and blazed forth in jewels. The Cardinal\r\nblessed the standards of the invaders in his magnificent cathedral, and\r\nlighted up his palace in honour of the great deliverance. It seemed that\r\nthe struggle had terminated in favour of the Archduke, and that nothing\r\nremained for Philip but a prompt flight into the dominions of his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nSo judged those who were ignorant of the character and habits of the\r\nSpanish people. There is no country in Europe which it is so easy\r\nto overrun as Spain: there is no country in Europe which it is more\r\ndifficult to conquer. Nothing can be more contemptible than the regular\r\nmilitary resistance which Spain offers to an invader; nothing more\r\nformidable than the energy which she puts forth when her regular\r\nmilitary resistance has been beaten down. Her armies have long borne too\r\nmuch resemblance to mobs; but her mobs have had, in an unusual degree,\r\nthe spirit of armies. The soldier, as compared with other soldiers, is\r\ndeficient in military qualities; but the peasant has as much of those\r\nqualities as the soldier. In no country have such strong fortresses been\r\ntaken by surprise: in no country have unfortified towns made so furious\r\nand {121}obstinate a resistance to great armies. War in Spain has, from\r\nthe days of the Romans, had a character of its own it is a fire which\r\ncannot he raked out; it burns fiercely under the embers; and long after\r\nit has, to all seeming, been extinguished, bursts forth more violently\r\nthan ever. This was seen in the last war. Spain had no army which could\r\nhave looked in the face an equal number of French or Prussian soldiers;\r\nbut one day laid the Prussian monarchy in the dust; one day put the\r\ncrown of France at the disposal of invaders. No Jena, no Waterloo, would\r\nhave enabled Joseph to reign in quiet at Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Castilians throughout the War of the Succession was\r\nmost characteristic. With all the odds of number and situation on their\r\nside, they had been ignominiously beaten. All the European dependencies\r\nof the Spanish crown were lost. Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia had\r\nacknowledged the Austrian Prince. Gibraltar had been taken by a few\r\nsailors; Barcelona stormed by a few dismounted dragoons. The invaders\r\nhad penetrated into the centre of the Peninsula, and were quartered at\r\nMadrid and Toledo. While these events had been in progress, the nation\r\nhad scarcely given a sign of life. The rich could hardly be prevailed on\r\nto give or to lend for the support of war; the troops had shown neither\r\ndiscipline nor courage; and now at last, when it seemed that all was\r\nlost, when it seemed that the most sanguine must relinquish all hope,\r\nthe national spirit awoke, fierce, proud, and unconquerable. The people\r\nhad been sluggish when the circumstances might well have inspired hope;\r\nthey reserved all their energy for what appeared to be a season of\r\ndespair. Castile, Leon, Andalusia, Estremadura, rose at once; every\r\npeasant {122}procured a firelock or a pike; the Allies were masters\r\nonly of the ground on which they trod. No soldier could wander a hundred\r\nyards from the main body of the invading army without imminent risk of\r\nbeing poniarded. The country through which the conquerors had passed to\r\nMadrid, and which, as they thought, they had subdued, was all in arms\r\nbehind them. Their communications with Portugal were cut off. In the\r\nmean time, money began, for the first time, to flow rapidly into the\r\ntreasury of the fugitive king. “The day before yesterday,” says the\r\nPrincess Orsini, in a letter written at this time, “the priest of\r\na village which contains only a hundred and twenty houses brought a\r\nhundred and twenty pistoles to the Queen. ‘My flock,’ said he, ‘are\r\nashamed to send you so little; but they beg you to believe that in this\r\npurse there are a hundred and twenty hearts faithful even to the death.’\r\nThe good man wept as he spoke; and indeed we wept too. Yesterday another\r\nsmall village, in which there are only twenty houses, sent us fifty\r\npistoles.”\r\n\r\nWhile the Castilians were everywhere arming in the cause of Philip, the\r\nAllies ware serving that cause as effectually by their mismanagement.\r\nGalway staid at Madrid, where his soldiers indulged in such boundless\r\nlicentiousness that one half of them were in the hospitals. Charles\r\nremained dawdling in Catalonia. Peterborough had taken Requena, and\r\nwished to march from Valencia towards Madrid, and to effect a junction\r\nwith Galway; but the Archduke refused his consent to the plan. The\r\nindignant general remained accordingly in his favourite city, on the\r\nbeautiful shores of the Mediterranean, reading Don Quixote, giving\r\nballs and suppers, trying in vain to get some good {123}sport out of the\r\nValencia bulls, and making love, not in vain, to the Valencian women.\r\n\r\nAt length the Archduke advanced into Castile, and ordered Peterborough\r\nto join him. But it was too late. Berwick had already compelled\r\nGalway to evacuate Madrid; and, when the whole force of the Allies\r\nwas collected at Guadalaxara, it was found to be decidedly inferior in\r\nnumbers to that of the enemy.\r\n\r\nPeterborough formed a plan for regaining possession of the capital.\r\nHis plan was rejected by Charles. The patience of the sensitive and\r\nvainglorious hero was worn out. He had none of that serenity of temper\r\nwhich enabled Marlborough to act in perfect harmony with Eugene, and\r\nto endure the vexatious interference of the Dutch deputies. He demanded\r\npermission to leave the army. Permission was readily granted; and he set\r\nout for Italy. That there might be some pretext for his departure, he\r\nwas commissioned by the Archduke to raise a loan in Genoa on the credit\r\nof the revenues of Spain.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment to the end of the campaign the tide of fortune ran\r\nstrong against the Austrian cause. Berwick had placed his army between\r\nthe Allies and the frontiers of Portugal. They retreated on Valencia,\r\nand arrived in that province, leaving about ten thousand prisoners in\r\nthe hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1707, Peterborough arrived at Valencia from Italy, no longer\r\nbearing a public character, but merely as a volunteer. His advice was\r\nasked, and it seems to have been most judicious. He gave it as his\r\ndecided opinion that no offensive operations against Castile ought to be\r\nundertaken. It would be easy, he said, to defend Arragon, Catalonia, and\r\nValencia, against Philip. The inhabitants of those parts of {124}Spain\r\nwere attached to the cause of the Archduke; and the armies of the House\r\nof Bourbon would be resisted by the whole population. In a short time\r\nthe enthusiasm of the Castilians might abate. The government of Philip\r\nmight commit unpopular acts. Defeats in the Netherlands might compel\r\nLewis to withdraw the succours which he had furnished to his grandson.\r\nThen would be the time to strike a decisive blow. This excellent advice\r\nwas rejected. Peterborough, who had now received formal letters of\r\nrecall from England, departed before the opening of the campaign; and\r\nwith him departed the good fortune of the Allies. Scarcely any general\r\nhad ever done so much with means so small. Scarcely any general had ever\r\ndisplayed equal originality and boldness. He possessed, in the highest\r\ndegree, the art of conciliating those whom he had subdued. But he was\r\nnot equally successful in winning the attachment of those with whom he\r\nacted. He was adored by the Catalonians and Valencians; but he was hated\r\nby the prince whom he had all but made a great king, and by the generals\r\nwhose fortune and reputation were staked on the same venture with\r\nhis own. The English government could not understand him. He was so\r\neccentric that they gave him no credit for the judgment which he really\r\npossessed. One day he took towns with horse-soldiers; then again he\r\nturned some hundreds of infantry into cavalry at a minute’s notice. He\r\nobtained his political intelligence chiefly by means of love affairs,\r\nand filled his despatches with epigrams. The ministers thought that it\r\nwould be highly impolitic to intrust the conduct of the Spanish war to\r\nso volatile and romantic a person. They therefore gave the command to\r\nLord Galway, an experienced veteran, a man who was in war {125}what\r\nMoliere’s doctors were in medicine, who thought it much more honourable\r\nto fail according to rule, than to succeed by innovation, and who would\r\nhave been very much ashamed of himself if he had taken Monjuich by means\r\nso strange as those which Peterborough employed. This great commander\r\nconducted the campaign of 1707 in the most scientific manner. On the\r\nplain of Almanza he encountered the army of the Bourbons. He drew up his\r\ntroops according to the methods prescribed by the best writers, and in\r\na few hours lost eighteen thousand men, a hundred and twenty standards,\r\nall his baggage and all his artillery. Valencia and Arragon were\r\ninstantly conquered by the French, and, at the close of the year, the\r\nmountainous province of Catalonia was the only part of Spain which still\r\nadhered to Charles.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember, child,” says the foolish woman in the Spectator to\r\nher husband, “that the pigeon-house fell the very afternoon that our\r\ncareless wench spilt the salt upon the table?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear,” replies the gentleman, “and the next post brought us an\r\naccount of the battle of Almanza.” The approach of disaster in Spain had\r\nbeen for some time indicated by omens much clearer than the mishap of\r\nthe saltcellar; an ungrateful prince, an undisciplined army, a divided\r\ncouncil, envy triumphant over merit, a man of genius recalled, a pedant\r\nand a sluggard intrusted with supreme command. The battle of Almanza\r\ndecided the fate of Spain. The loss was such as Marlborough or Eugene\r\ncould scarcely have retrieved, and was certainly not to be retrieved by\r\nStanhope and Staremberg.\r\n\r\nStanhope, who took the command of the English army in Catalonia, was a\r\nman of respectable abilities, {126}both in military and civil affairs,\r\nbut fitter, we conceive, for a second than for a first place. Lord\r\nMahon, with his usual candour, tells us, what we believe was not known\r\nbefore, that his ancestor’s most distinguished exploit, the conquest\r\nof Minorea, was suggested by Marlborough. Staremberg, a methodical\r\ntactician of the German school, was sent by the emperor to command\r\nin Spain. Two languid campaigns followed, during which neither of the\r\nhostile armies did any thing memorable, but during which both were\r\nnearly starved.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1710, the chiefs of the Allied forces resolved to venture\r\non bolder measures. They began the campaign with a daring move, pushed\r\ninto Arragon, defeated the troops of Philip at Almenara, defeated\r\nthem again at Saragossa, and advanced to Madrid. The King was again a\r\nfugitive. The Castilians sprang to arms with the same enthusiasm which\r\nthey had displayed in 1700. The conquerors found the capital a desert.\r\nThe people shut themselves up in their houses, and refused to pay any\r\nmark of respect to the Austrian prince. It was necessary to hire a few\r\nchildren to shout before him in the streets. Meanwhile, the court\r\nof Philip at Valladolid was thronged by nobles and prelates. Thirty\r\nthousand people followed their King from Madrid to his new residence.\r\nWomen of rank, rather than remain behind, performed the journey on foot.\r\nThe peasants enlisted by thousands. Money, arms, and provisions, were\r\nsupplied in abundance by the zeal of the people. The country round\r\nMadrid was infested by small parties of irregular horse. The Allies\r\ncould not send off a despatch to Arragon, or introduce a supply of\r\nprovisions into the capital. It was unsafe for the Archduke to hunt\r\n{127}in the immediate vicinity of the palace which he occupied.\r\n\r\nThe wish of Stanhope was to winter in Castile. But he stood alone in the\r\ncouncil of war; and, indeed, it is not easy to understand how the Allies\r\ncould have maintained themselves, through so unpropitious a season, in\r\nthe midst of so hostile a population. Charles, whose personal safety was\r\nthe first object of the generals, was sent with an escort of cavalry to\r\nCatalonia in November; and in December the army commenced its retreat\r\ntowards Arragon.\r\n\r\nBut the Allies had to do with a master-spirit. The King of France\r\nhad lately sent the Duke of Vendome to command in Spain. This man was\r\ndistinguished by the filthiness of his person, by the brutality of\r\nhis demeanour, by the gross buffonery of his conversation, and by the\r\nimpudence with which he abandoned himself to the most nauseous of all\r\nvices. His sluggishness was almost incredible. Even when engaged in a\r\ncampaign, he often passed whole days in his bed. His strange torpidity\r\nhad been the cause of some of the most serious disasters which the\r\narmies of the House of Bourbon had sustained. But when he was roused\r\nby any great emergency, his resources, his energy, and his presence of\r\nmind, were such as had been found in no French general since the death\r\nof Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis, Vendome was all himself. He set out from Talavera with\r\nhis troops, and pursued the retreating army of the Allies with a speed\r\nperhaps never equalled, in such a season, and in such a country. He\r\nmarched night and day. He swam, at the head of his cavalry, the flooded\r\nstream of Henares, and, in a few days, overtook Stanhope, who was at\r\nBrihuega {128}with the left wing of the Allied army. “Nobody with me,”\r\n says the English general, “imagined that they had any foot within\r\nsome days’ march of us; and our misfortune is owing to the incredible\r\ndiligence which their army made.” Stanhope had but just time to send\r\noff a messenger to the centre of the army, which was some leagues from\r\nBrihuega, before Vendome was upon him. The town was invested on every\r\nside. The walls were battered with cannon. A mine was sprung under one\r\nof the gates. The English kept up a terrible fire till their powder\r\nwas spent. They then fought desperately with the bayonet against\r\noverwhelming odds. They burned the houses which the assailants\r\nhad taken. But all was to no purpose. The British general saw that\r\nresistance could produce only a useless carnage. He concluded a\r\ncapitulation; and his gallant little army became prisoners of war on\r\nhonourable terms.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Vendôme signed the capitulation, when he learned that\r\nStaremberg was marching to the relief of Stanhope. Preparations were\r\ninstantly made for a general action. On the day following that on which\r\nthe English had delivered up their arms, was fought the obstinate and\r\nbloody fight of Villa-Viciosa. Staremberg remained master of the field.\r\nVendome reaped all the fruits of the battle. The Allies spiked their\r\ncannon, and retired towards Arragon. But even in Arragon they found\r\nno place of rest. Vendome was behind them. The guerrilla parties were\r\naround them. They fled to Catalonia; but Catalonia was invaded by a\r\nFrench army from Roussillon. At length the Austrian general, with\r\nsix thousand harassed and dispirited men, the remains of a great and\r\nvictorious army, took refuge in Barcelona, {129}almost the only place in\r\nSpain which still recognised the authority of Charles.\r\n\r\nPhilip was now much safer at Madrid than his grandfather at Paris. All\r\nhope of conquering Spain in Spain was at an end. But in other quarters\r\nthe House of Bourbon was reduced to the last extremity. The French\r\narmies had undergone a series of defeats in Germany, in Italy, and in\r\nthe Netherlands. An immense force, flushed with victory, and commanded\r\nby the greatest generals of the age, was on the borders of France. Lewis\r\nhad been forced to humble himself before the conquerors. He had even\r\noffered to abandon the cause of his grandson; and his offer had been\r\nrejected. But a great turn in affairs was approaching.\r\n\r\nThe English administration which had commenced the war against the House\r\nof Bourbon was an administration composed of Tories. But the war was a\r\nWhig war. It was the favourite scheme of William, the Whig King. Lewis\r\nhad provoked it by recognising, as sovereign of England, a prince\r\npeculiarly hateful to the Whigs. It had placed England in a position\r\nof marked hostility to that power from which alone the Pretender could\r\nexpect efficient succour. It had joined England in the closest union\r\nto a Protestant and republican state, to a state which had assisted in\r\nbringing about the Revolution, and which was willing; to guarantee the\r\nexecution of the Act of Settlement. Marlborough and Godolphin found that\r\nthey were more zealously supported by their old opponents than by\r\ntheir old associates. Those ministers who were zealous for the war\r\nwere gradually converted to Whiggism. The rest dropped off, and were\r\nsucceeded by Whigs. Cowper became Chancellor. Sunderland, in spite of\r\nthe very just antipathy of Anne, was made Secretary {130}of State. On\r\nthe death of the Prince of Denmark a more extensive change took place.\r\nWharton became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Somers President of the\r\nCouncil. At length the administration was wholly in the hands of the Low\r\nChurch party.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1710 a violent change took place. The Queen had always been\r\na Tory at heart. Her religious feelings were all on the side of the\r\nEstablished Church. Her family feelings pleaded in favour of her exiled\r\nbrother. Her selfish feelings disposed her to favour the zealots of\r\nprerogative. The affection which she felt for the Duchess of Marlborough\r\nwas the great security of the Whigs. That affection had at length turned\r\nto deadly aversion. While the great party which had long swayed the\r\ndestinies of Europe was undermined by bedchamber women at St. James’s,\r\na violent storm gathered in the country. A foolish parson had preached\r\na foolish sermon against the principles of the Revolution. The wisest\r\nmember of the government were for letting the man alone. But Godolphin,\r\ninflamed with all the zeal of a new-made Whig, and exasperated by\r\na nickname which was applied to him in this unfortunate discourse,\r\ninsisted that the preacher should be impeached. The exhortations of the\r\nmild and sagacious Somers were disregarded. The impeachment was brought;\r\nthe doctor was convicted; and the accusers were ruined. The clergy came\r\nto the rescue of the persecuted clergyman. The country gentlemen came\r\nto the rescue of the clergy. A display of Tory feelings, such as England\r\nhad not witnessed since the closing years of Charles the Second’s reign,\r\nappalled the Ministers and gave boldness to the Queen. She turned\r\nout the Whigs, called Harley and St. John to power, and dissolved\r\nthe Parliament. The {131}elections went strongly against the late\r\ngovernment. Stanhope, who had in his absence been put in nomination\r\nfor Westminster, was defeated by a Tory candidate. The new Ministers,\r\nfinding themselves masters of the new Parliament, were induced by the\r\nstrongest motives to conclude a peace with France. The whole system of\r\nalliance in which the country was engaged was a Whig system. The general\r\nby whom the English armies had constantly been led to victory, and for\r\nwhom it was impossible to find a substitute, was now, whatever he might\r\nformerly have been, a Whig general. If Marlborough were discarded it\r\nwas probable that some great disaster would follow. Yet, if he were\r\nto retain his command, every great action which he might perform would\r\nraise the credit of the party in opposition.\r\n\r\nA peace was therefore concluded between England and the Princes of\r\nthe House of Bourbon. Of that peace Lord Mahon speaks in terms of the\r\nseverest reprehension. He is, indeed, an excellent Whig of the time of\r\nthe first Lord Stanhope. “I cannot but pause for a moment,” says he, “to\r\nobserve how much the course of a century has inverted the meaning of our\r\nparty nicknames, how much a modern Tory resembles a Whig of Queen Anne’s\r\nreign, and a Tory of Queen Anne’s reign a modern Whig.”\r\n\r\nWe grant one half of Lord Mahon’s proposition: from the other half\r\nwe altogether dissent. We allow that a modern Tory resembles, in many\r\nthings, a Whig of Queen Anne’s reign. It is natural that such should be\r\nthe case. The worst things of one age often resemble the best things of\r\nanother. A modern shopkeeper’s house is as well furnished as the house\r\nof a considerable merchant in Anne’s reign. Very plain people now\r\n{132}wear finer cloth than Beau Fielding or Beau Edgeworth could have\r\nprocured in Queen Anne’s reign. We would rather trust to the apothecary\r\nof a modern village than to the physician of a large town in Anne’s\r\nreign. A modern boarding-school miss could tell the most learned\r\nprofessor of Anne’s reign some things in geography, astronomy, and\r\nchemistry, which would surprise him.\r\n\r\nThe science of government is an experimental science; and therefore it\r\nis, like all other experimental sciences, a progressive science. Lord\r\nMahon would have been a very good Whig in the days of Harley. But\r\nHarley, whom Lord Mahon censures so severely, was very Whiggish when\r\ncompared even with Clarendon; and Clarendon was quite a democrat when\r\ncompared with Lord Burleigh. If Lord Mahon lives, as we hope he will,\r\nfifty years longer, we have no doubt that, as he now boasts of the\r\nresemblance which the Tories of our time bear to the Whigs of the\r\nRevolution, he will then boast of the resemblance borne by the Tories of\r\n1882 to those immortal patriots, the Whigs of the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nSociety, we believe, is constantly advancing in knowledge. The tail is\r\nnow where the head was some generations ago. But the head and the tail\r\nstill keep their distance. A nurse of this century is as wise as a\r\njustice of the quorum and custalorum in Shallow’s time. The wooden\r\nspoon of this year would puzzle a senior wrangler of the reign of George\r\nthe Second. A boy from the National School reads and spells better than\r\nhalf the knights of the shire in the October Club. But there is still as\r\nwide a difference as ever between justices and nurses, senior wranglers\r\nand wooden spoons, members of Parliament and children at charity\r\n{133}schools. In the same way, though a Tory may now be very like what a\r\nWhig was a hundred and twenty years ago, the Whig is as much in advance\r\nof the Tory as ever. The stag, in the Treatise on the Bathos, who\r\n“feared his hind feet would o’ertake the fore,” was not more mistaken\r\nthan Lord Mahon, if he thinks that he has really come up with the Whigs.\r\nThe absolute position of the parties has been altered; the relative\r\nposition remains unchanged. Through the whole of that great movement,\r\nwhich began before these party-names existed, and which will continue\r\nafter they have become obsolete, through the whole of that great\r\nmovement of which the Charter of John, the institution of the House of\r\nCommons, the extinction of Villanage, the separation from the see of\r\nRome, the expulsion of the Stuarts, the reform of the Representative\r\nSystem, are successive stages, there have been, under some name or\r\nother, two sets of men, those who were before their age, and those who\r\nwere behind it, those who were the wisest among their contemporaries,\r\nand those who* gloried in being no wiser than their great grandfathers.\r\nIt is delightful to think, that, in due time, the last of those who\r\nstraggle in the rear of the great march will occupy the place now\r\noccupied by the advanced guard. The Tory Parliament of 1710 would have\r\npassed for a most liberal Parliament in the days of Elizabeth; and there\r\nare at present few members of the Conservative Club who would not have\r\nbeen fully qualified to sit with Halifax and Somers at the Kit-cat.\r\n\r\nThough, therefore, we admit that a modern Tory bears some resemblance\r\nto a Whig of Queen Anne’s reign, we can by no means admit that a Tory of\r\nAnne’s reign resembled a modern Whig. Have the modern Whigs passed laws\r\nfor the purpose of closing the {134}entrance of the House of Commons\r\nagainst the new interests created by trade? Do the modern Whigs bold the\r\ndoctrine of divine right? Have the modern Whigs laboured to exclude all\r\nDissenters from office and Power? The modern Whigs are, indeed, at the\r\npresent moment, like the Tories of 1712, desirous of peace, and of close\r\nunion with France. But is there no difference between the France of\r\n1712 and the France of 1832? Is France now the stronghold of the “Popish\r\ntyranny” and the “arbitrary power” against which our ancestors fought\r\nand prayed? Lord Mahon will find, we think, that his parallel is, in\r\nall essential circumstances, as incorrect as that which Finellen drew\r\nbetween Macedon and Monmouth, or as that which an ingenious Tory lately\r\ndiscovered between Archbishop Williams and Archbishop Vernon.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Lord Mahon in thinking highly of the Whigs of Queen Anne’s\r\nreign. But that part of their conduct which he selects for especial\r\npraise is precisely the part which we think most objectionable. We\r\nrevere them as the great champions of political and of intellectual\r\nliberty. It is true that, when raised to power, they were not exempt\r\nfrom the faults which power naturally engenders. It is true that they\r\nwere men born in the seventeenth century, and that they were therefore\r\nignorant of many truths which are familiar to the men of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. But they were, what the reformers of the Church were before\r\nthem, and what the reformers of the House of Commons have been since,\r\nthe leaders of their species in a right direction. It is true that they\r\ndid not allow to political discussion that latitude which to us appears\r\nreasonable and safe; but to them we owe the removal of the Censorship.\r\nIt is true that they did not carry {135}the principle of religious\r\nliberty to its full extent; but to them we owe the Toleration Act.\r\n\r\nThough, however, we think that the Whigs of Anne’s reign, were, as a\r\nbody, far superior in wisdom and public virtue to their contemporaries\r\nthe Tories, we by no means hold ourselves bound to defend all the\r\nmeasures of our favourite party. A life of action, if it is to be\r\nuseful, must be a life of compromise. But speculation admits of no\r\ncompromise. A public man is often under the necessity of consenting\r\nto measures which he dislikes, lest he should endanger the success of\r\nmeasures which he thinks of vital importance. But the historian lies\r\nunder no such necessity. On the contrary, it is one of his most sacred\r\nduties to point out clearly the errors of those whose general conduct he\r\nadmires.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us, then, that, on the great question which divided England\r\nduring the last four years of Anne’s reign, the Tories were in the\r\nright, and the Whigs in the wrong. That question was, whether England\r\nought to conclude peace without exacting from Philip a resignation of\r\nthe Spanish crown?\r\n\r\nNo Parliamentary struggle, from the time of the Exclusion Bill to the\r\ntime of the Reform Bill, has been so violent as that which took place\r\nbetween the authors of the Treaty of Utrecht and the War Party. The\r\nCommons were for peace; the Lords were for vigorous hostilities. The\r\nqueen was compelled to choose which of her two highest prerogatives\r\nshe would exercise, whether she would create Peers or dissolve the\r\nParliament. The ties of party superseded the ties of neighbourhood and\r\nof blood. The members of the hostile factions would scarcely speak to\r\neach other, or bow to each other. The women appeared at the theatres\r\n{136}bearing the badges of their political sect. The schism extended to\r\nthe most remote counties of England. Talents, such as had seldom before\r\nbeen displayed in political controversy, were enlisted in the service\r\nof the hostile parties. On one side was Steele, gay, lively, drunk\r\nwith animal spirits and with factions animosity, and Addison, with his\r\npolished satire, his inexhaustible fertility of fancy, and his graceful\r\nsimplicity of style. In the front of the opposite ranks appeared a\r\ndarker and fiercer spirit, the apostate politician, the ribald priest,\r\nthe perjured lover, a heart burning with hatred against the whole\r\nhuman race, a mind richly stored with images from the dunghill and the\r\nlazar-house. The ministers triumphed, and the peace was concluded.\r\nThen came the reaction. A new sovereign ascended the throne. The Whigs\r\nenjoyed the confidence of the King and of the Parliament. The unjust\r\nseverity with which the Tories had treated ‘Marlborough and Walpole\r\nwas more than retaliated. Harley and Prior were thrown into prison;\r\nBoling-broke and Ormond were compelled to take refuge in a foreign land.\r\nThe wounds inflicted in this desperate conflict continued to rankle for\r\nmany years. It was long before the members of either party could discuss\r\nthe question of the peace of Utrecht with calmness and impartiality.\r\nThat the Whig Ministers had sold us to the Dutch; that the Tory\r\nMinisters had sold us to the French; that the war had been earned\r\non only to fill the pockets of Marlborough; that the peace had been\r\nconcluded only to facilitate the return of the Pretender: these\r\nimputations and many others, utterly unfounded, or grossly exaggerated,\r\nwere hurled backward and forward by the political disputants of the\r\nlast century. In our time the question may be discussed without\r\n{137}irritation. We will state, as concisely as possible, the reasons\r\nwhich have led us to the conclusion at which we have arrived.\r\n\r\nThe dangers which were to be apprehended from the peace were two;\r\nfirst, the danger that Philip might be induced, by feelings of private\r\naffection, to act in strict concert with the elder branch of his house,\r\nto favour the French trade at the expense of England, and to side with\r\nthe French government in future wars; secondly, the danger that the\r\nposterity of the Duke of Burgundy might become extinct, that Philip\r\nmight become heir by blood to the French crown, and that thus two great\r\nmonarchies might be united under one sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe first danger appears to us altogether chimerical. Family affection\r\nhas seldom produced much effect on the policy of princes. The state of\r\nEurope at the time of the peace of Utrecht proved that in politics\r\nthe ties of interest are much stronger than those of consanguinity or\r\naffinity. The Elector of Bavaria had been driven from his dominions by\r\nhis father-in-law; Victor Amadeus was in arms against his sons-in-law;\r\nAnne was seated on a throne from which she had assisted to push a\r\nmost indulgent father. It is true that Philip had been accustomed from\r\nchildhood to regard his grandfather with profound veneration. It was\r\nprobable, therefore, that the influence of Lewis at Madrid would be\r\nvery great. But Lewis was more than seventy years old; he could not live\r\nlong; his heir was an infant in the cradle. There was surely no reason\r\nto think that the policy of the King of Spain would be swayed by his\r\nregard for a nephew whom he had never seen.\r\n\r\nIn fact, soon after the peace, the two branches of the {138}House of\r\nBourbon began to quarrel. A close alliance was formed between Philip and\r\nCharles, lately competitors for the Castilian crown. A Spanish princess,\r\nbetrothed to the King of France, was sent back in the most insulting\r\nmanner to her native country; and a decree was put forth by the Court of\r\nMadrid commanding every Frenchman to leave Spain. It is true that, fifty\r\nyears after the peace of Utrecht, an alliance of peculiar strictness was\r\nformed between the French and Spanish governments. But both governments\r\nwere actuated on that occasion, not by domestic affection, but by common\r\ninterests, and common enmities. Their compact, though called the Family\r\nCompact, was as purely a political compact as the league of Cambrai or\r\nthe league of Pilnitz.\r\n\r\nThe second danger was that Philip might have succeeded to the crown of\r\nhis native country. This did not happen: but it might have happened; and\r\nat one time it seemed very likely to happen. A sickly child alone stood\r\nbetween the King of Spain and the heritage of Lewis the Fourteenth.\r\nPhilip, it is true, solemnly renounced his claim to the French crown.\r\nBut the manner in which he had obtained possession of the Spanish crown\r\nhad proved the inefficacy of such renunciations. The French lawyers\r\ndeclared Philip’s renunciation null, as being inconsistent with the\r\nfundamental law of the realm. The French people would probably have\r\nsided with him whom they would have considered as the rightful heir.\r\nSaint Simon, though much less zealous for hereditary monarchy than most\r\nof his countrymen, and though strongly attached to the Regent, declared,\r\nin the presence of that prince, that, he never would support the\r\nclaims of the House of Orleans against those of the King of Spain.\r\n“If {139}such,” he said, “be my feelings, what must be the feelings\r\nof others?” Bolingbroke, it is certain, was fully convinced that the\r\nrenunciation was worth no more than the paper on which it was written,\r\nand demanded it only for the purpose of blinding the English Parliament\r\nand people.\r\n\r\nYet, though it was at one time probable that the posterity of the Duke\r\nof Burgundy would become ex tinct, and though it is almost certain that,\r\nif the posterity of the Duke of Burgundy had become extinct, Philip\r\nwould have successfully preferred his claim to the crown of France, we\r\nstill defend the principle of the Treaty of Utrecht. In the first place,\r\nCharles had, soon after the battle of Villa-Viciosa, inherited, by the\r\ndeath of his elder brother, all the dominions of the House of Austria.\r\nSurely, if to these dominions he had added the whole monarchy of Spain,\r\nthe balance of power would have been seriously endangered. The union\r\nof the Austrian dominions and Spain would not, it is true, have been\r\nso alarming an event as the union of France and Spain. But Charles was\r\nactually Emperor. Philip was not, and never might be, King of France.\r\nThe certainty of the less evil might well be set against the chance of\r\nthe greater evil.\r\n\r\nBut, in fact, we do not believe that Spain would long have remained\r\nunder the government either of an Emperor or of a King of France. The\r\ncharacter of the Spanish people was a better security to the nations of\r\nEurope than any will, any instrument of renunciation, or any treaty. The\r\nsame energy which the people of Castile had put forth when Madrid was\r\noccupied by the Allied armies, they would have again put forth as soon\r\nas it appeared that their country was {140}about to become a French\r\nprovince. Though they were no longer masters abroad, they were by no\r\nmeans disposed to see foreigners set over them at home. If Philip had\r\nattempted to govern Spain by mandates from Versailles, a second Grand\r\nAlliance would easily have effected what the first had failed to\r\naccomplish. The Spanish nation would have rallied against him as\r\nzealously as it had before rallied round him. And of this he seems to\r\nhave been fully aware. For many years the favourite hope of his heart\r\nwas that he might ascend the throne of his grandfather; but he seems\r\nnever to have thought it possible that he could reign at once in the\r\ncountry of his adoption and in the country of his birth.\r\n\r\nThese were the dangers of the peace; and they seem to us to be of no\r\nvery formidable kind. Against these dangers are to be set off’ the evils\r\nof war and the risk of failure. The evils of the war, the waste of life,\r\nthe suspension of trade, the expenditure of wealth, the accumulation of\r\ndebt, require no illustration. The chances of failure it is difficult at\r\nthis distance of time to calculate with accuracy. But we think that an\r\nestimate approximating to the truth may, without much difficulty, be\r\nformed. The Allies had been victorious in Germany, Italy, and Flanders.\r\nIt was by no means improbable that they might fight their way into the\r\nvery heart of France. But at no time since the commencement of the war\r\nhad their prospects been so dark in that country which was the very\r\nobject of the struggle. In Spain they held only a few square leagues.\r\nThe temper of the great majority of the nation was decidedly hostile to\r\nthem. If they had persisted, if they had obtained success equal to their\r\nhighest expectations, if they had gained a series of victories as splendid\r\n{141}as those of Blenheim and Ramilies, if Paris had fallen, if\r\nLewis had been a prisoner, we still doubt whether they would have\r\naccomplished their object. They would still have had to carry on\r\ninterminable hostilities against the whole population of a country which\r\naffords peculiar facilities to irregular warfare, and in which invading\r\narmies suffer more from famine than from the sword.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, for the peace of Utrecht. We are indeed no admirers\r\nof the statesmen who concluded that peace. Harley, we believe, was a\r\nsolemn trifler, St. John a brilliant knave. The great body of their\r\nfollowers consisted of the country clergy and the country gentry;\r\ntwo classes of men who were then inferior in intelligence to decent\r\nshopkeepers or farmers of our time. Parson Barnabas, Parson Trulliber,\r\nSir Wilful Witwould, Sir Francis Wronghead, Squire Western, Squire\r\nSullen, such were the people who composed the main strength of the Tory\r\nparty during the sixty years which followed the Revolution. It is true\r\nthat the means by which the Tories came into power in 1710 were most\r\ndisreputable. It is true that the manner in which they used their power\r\nwas often unjust and cruel. It is true that, in order to bring\r\nabout their favourite project of peace, they resorted to slander and\r\ndeception, without the slightest scruple. It is true that they passed\r\noff on the British nation a renunciation which they knew to be invalid.\r\nIt is true that they gave up the Catalans to the vengeance of Philip,\r\nin a manner inconsistent with humanity and national honour. But on the\r\ngreat question of Peace or War, we cannot but think that, though\r\ntheir motives may have been selfish and malevolent, their decision was\r\nbeneficial to the state. {142}But we have already exceeded our limits.\r\nIt remains only for us to bid Lord Mahon heartily farewell, and\r\nto assure him that, whatever dislike we may feel for his political\r\nopinions, we shall always meet him with pleasure on the neutral ground\r\nof literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORACE WALPOLE. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, October, 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe {143}cannot transcribe this titlepage without strong feelings of\r\nregret. The editing of these volumes was the last of the useful and\r\nmodest services rendered to literature by a nobleman of amiable manners,\r\nof untarnished public and private character, and of cultivated mind. On\r\nthis, as on other occasions, Lord Dover performed his part diligently,\r\njudiciously, and without the slightest ostentation. He had two merits\r\nwhich are rarely found together in a commentator. He was content to\r\nbe merely a commentator, to keep in the background, and to leave the\r\nforeground to the author whom he had undertaken to illustrate. Yet,\r\nthough willing to be an attendant, he was by no means a slave; nor did\r\nhe consider it as part of his duty to see no faults in the writer\r\nto whom he faithfully and assiduously rendered the humblest literary\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nThe faults of Horace Walpole’s head and heart are indeed sufficiently\r\nglaring. His writings, it is true, rank as high among the delicacies of\r\nintellectual epicures as the Strasburg pies among the dishes\r\n\r\n     (1) _Letters of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford, to Sir\r\n     Horace Mann, British Envoy at the Court of Tuscany_. Now\r\n     first published from the Originals in the Possession of the\r\n     Earl of Waldgeark. Edited by Lord Dover. 2 vols. 8vo.\r\n     London: 1838.\r\n\r\n{144}described in the _Almanach des Grourmands_. But as the\r\n_pâté-de-foie-gras_ owes its excellence to the diseases of the wretched\r\nanimal which furnishes it, and would be good for nothing if it were not\r\nmade of livers preternaturally swollen, so none but an unhealthy and\r\ndisorganised mind could have produced such literary luxuries as the\r\nworks of Walpole.\r\n\r\nHe was, unless we have formed a very erroneous judgment of his\r\ncharacter, the most eccentric, the most artificial, the most fastidious,\r\nthe most capricious of men. His mind was a bundle of inconsistent whims\r\nand affectations. His features were covered by mask within mask. When\r\nthe outer disguise of obvious affectation was removed, you were still as\r\nfar as ever from seeing the real man. He played innumerable parts, and\r\nover-acted them all. When he talked misanthropy, lie out-Timoned Timon.\r\nWhen he talked philanthropy, he left Howard at an immeasurable distance.\r\nHe scoffed at courts, and kept a chronicle of their most trifling\r\nscandal; at society, and was blown about by its slightest veerings of\r\nopinion; at literary fame, and left fair copies of his private letters,\r\nwith copious notes, to be published after his decease; at rank, and\r\nnever for a moment forgot that he was an Honourable; at the practice of\r\nentail, and tasked the ingenuity of conveyancers to tie up his villa in\r\nthe strictest settlement.\r\n\r\nThe conformation of his mind was such that whatever was little seemed to\r\nhim great, and whatever was great seemed to him little. Serious business\r\nwas a trifle to him, and trifles were his serious business. To chat with\r\nblue stockings, to write little copies of complimentary verses on little\r\noccasions, to superintend a private press, to preserve from natural\r\ndecay {145}the perishable topics of Ranelagli and White’s, to record\r\ndivorces and bets, Miss Chudleigh’s absurdities and George Selwyn’s good\r\nsayings, to decorate a grotesque house with pie-crust battlements,\r\nto procure rare engravings and antique chimney-boards, to match odd\r\ngauntlets, to lay out a maze of walks within five acres of ground, these\r\nwere the grave employments of his long life. From these he turned to\r\npolitics as to an amusement. After the labours of the print-shop and\r\nthe auction-room he unbent his mind in the House of Commons. And,\r\nhaving indulged in the recreation of making laws and voting millions,\r\nhe returned to more important pursuits, to researches after Queen Mary’s\r\ncomb, Wolsey’s red hat, the pipe which Van Tromp smoked during his last\r\nsea-fight, and the spur which King William struck into the flank of\r\nSorrel.\r\n\r\nIn every thing in which Walpole busied himself, in the fine arts, in\r\nliterature, in public affairs, he was drawn by some strange attraction\r\nfrom the great to the little, and from the useful to the odd. The\r\npolitics in which he took the keenest interest, were politics scarcely\r\ndeserving of the name. The growlings of George the Second, the\r\nflirtations of Princess Emily with the Duke of Grafton, the amours of\r\nPrince Frederic and Lady Middlesex, the squabbles between Gold Stick in\r\nwaiting and the Master of the Buck-hounds, the disagreements between the\r\ntutors of Prince George, these matters engaged almost all the attention\r\nwhich Walpole could spare from matters more important still, from\r\nbidding for Zinckes and Petitots, from cheapening fragments of tapestry\r\nand handles of old lances, from joining bits of painted glass, and from\r\nsetting up memorials of departed cats and dogs. While he was fetching\r\nand carrying the gossip of Kensington {146}Palace and Carlton House,\r\nhe fancied that he was engaged in politics, and when he recorded that\r\ngossip, he fancied that he was writing history.\r\n\r\nHe was, as he has himself told us, fond of faction as an amusement. He\r\nloved mischief: but he loved quiet; and he was constantly on the watch\r\nfor opportunities of gratifying both his tastes at once, lie sometimes\r\ncontrived, without showing himself, to disturb the course of ministerial\r\nnegotiations and to spread confusion through the political circles. He\r\ndoes not himself pretend that, on these occasions, he was actuated by\r\npublic spirit; nor does he appear to have had any private advantage in\r\nview. He thought it a good practical joke to set public men together\r\nby the ears; and he enjoyed their perplexities, their accusations, and\r\ntheir recriminations, as a malicious boy enjoys the embarrassment of a\r\nmisdirected traveller.\r\n\r\nAbout politics, in the high sense of the word, he knew nothing, and\r\ncared nothing. He called himself a Whig. His father’s son could scarcely\r\nassume any other name. It pleased him also to affect a foolish dislike\r\nof kings as kings, and a foolish love and admiration of rebels as\r\nrebels: and perhaps, while kings were not in danger, and while rebels\r\nwere not in being, he really believed that he held the doctrines which\r\nhe professed. To go no further than the letters now before us, he is\r\nperpetually boasting to his friend Mann of his aversion to royalty\r\nand to royal persons. He calls the crime of Damien “that least bad of\r\nmurders, the murder of a king.” He hung up in his villa an engraving of\r\nthe death-warrant of Charles, with the inscription “_Major Charta_.” Yet\r\nthe most superficial knowledge of history might have taught him that the\r\nRestoration, and the crimes and follies of the twenty-{147}eight\r\nyears which followed the Restoration, were the effects of this Greater\r\nCharter. Nor was there much in the means by which that instrument was\r\nobtained that could gratify a judicious lover of liberty. A man must\r\nhate kings very bitterly, before he can think it desirable that the\r\nrepresentatives of the people should be turned out of doors by dragoons,\r\nin order to get at a king’s head. Walpole’s Whiggism, however, was of a\r\nvery harmless kind. He kept it, as he kept the old spears and helmets at\r\nStrawberry Hill, merely for show. He would just as soon have thought of\r\ntaking down the arms of the ancient Templars and Hospitallers from the\r\nwalls of his hall, and setting off on a crusade to the Holy Land, as of\r\nacting in the spirit of those daring warriors and statesmen, great even\r\nin their errors, whose names and seals were affixed to the warrant which\r\nhe prized so highly. He liked revolution and regicide only when they\r\nwere a hundred years old. His republicanism, like the courage of a\r\nbully, or the love of a fribble, was strong and ardent when there was no\r\noccasion for it, and subsided when he had an opportunity of bringing it\r\nto the proof. As soon as the revolutionary spirit really began to stir\r\nin Europe, as soon as the hatred of kings became something more than a\r\nsonorous phrase, he was frightened into a fanatical royalist, and became\r\none of the most extravagant alarmists of those wretched times. In\r\ntruth, his talk about liberty, whether he knew it or not, was from the\r\nbeginning a mere cant, the remains of a phraseology which had meant\r\nsomething in the mouths of those from whom he had learned it, but which,\r\nin his mouth, meant about as much as the oath by which the Knights of\r\nsome modern orders bind themselves to redress the wrongs of all injured\r\nladies. {148}He had been fed in his boyhood with Whig speculations on\r\ngovernment. He must often have seen, at Houghton or in Downing Street,\r\nmen who had been Whigs when it was as dangerous to be a Whig as to be\r\na highwayman, men who had voted for the Exclusion Bill, who had been\r\nconcealed in garrets and cellars after the battle of Sedgemoor, and who\r\nhad set their names to the declaration that they would live and die with\r\nthe Prince of Orange. He had acquired the language of these men, and he\r\nrepeated it by rote, though it was at variance with all his tastes and\r\nfeelings; just as some old Jacobite families persisted in praying for\r\nthe Pretender, and in passing their glasses over the water decanter,\r\nwhen they drank the King’s health, long after they had become loyal\r\nsupporters of the government of George the Third. He was a Whig by the\r\naccident of hereditary connection; but he was essentially a courtier;\r\nand not the less a courtier because he pretended to sneer at the objects\r\nwhich excited his admiration and envy. His real tastes perpetually show\r\nthemselves through the thin disguise. While professing all the contempt\r\nof Bradshaw or Ludlow for crowned heads, he took the trouble to write\r\na book concerning Royal Authors. He pryed with the utmost anxiety into\r\nthe most minute particulars relating to the Royal family. When he was\r\na child, he was haunted with a longing to see George the First, and\r\ngave his mother no peace till she had found a way of gratifying his\r\ncuriosity. The same feeling, covered with a thousand disguises, attended\r\nhim to the grave. No observation that dropped from the lips of Majesty\r\nseemed to him too trifling to be recorded. The French songs of Prince\r\nFrederic, compositions certainly not deserving of preservation on\r\naccount of {149}their intrinsic merit, have been carefully preserved for\r\nus by this contemner of royalty. In truth, every page of Walpole’s works\r\nbewrays him. This Diogenes, who would be thought to prefer his tub to\r\na palace, and who has nothing to ask of the masters of Windsor\r\nand Versailles but that they will stand out of his light, is a\r\ngentleman-usher at heart.\r\n\r\nHe had, it is plain, an uneasy consciousness of the frivolity of his\r\nfavourite pursuits; and this consciousness produced one of the most\r\ndiverting of his ten thousand affectations. His busy idleness, his\r\nindifference to matters which the world generally regards as important,\r\nhis passion for trifles, he thought fit to dignify with the name of\r\nphilosophy. He spoke of himself as of a man whose equanimity was proof\r\nto ambitious hopes and fears, who had learned to rate power, wealth, and\r\nfame at their true value, and whom the conflict of parties, the rise and\r\nfall of statesmen, the ebb and flow of public opinion, moved only to a\r\nsmile of mingled compassion and disdain. It was owing to the peculiar\r\nelevation of his character that he cared about a pinnacle of lath and\r\nplaster more than about the Middlesex election, and about a miniature of\r\nGrammont more than about the American Revolution. Pitt and Murray might\r\ntalk themselves hoarse about trifles. But questions of government\r\nand war were too insignificant to detain a mind which was occupied in\r\nrecording the scandal of club-rooms and the whispers of the back-stairs,\r\nand which was even capable of selecting and disposing chairs of ebony\r\nand shields of rhinoceros-skin.\r\n\r\nOne of his innumerable whims was an extreme unwillingness to be\r\nconsidered a man of letters. Not that he was indifferent to literary\r\nfame. Far from it. {150}Scarcely any writer lias ever troubled himself\r\nso much about the appearance which his works were to make before\r\nposterity. But he had set his heart on incompatible objects. He wished\r\nto be a celebrated author, and yet to be a mere idle gentleman, one of\r\nthose Epicurean gods of the earth who do nothing at all, and who pass\r\ntheir existence in the contemplation of their own perfections. He did\r\nnot like to have any thing in common with the wretches who lodged in the\r\nlittle courts behind St. Martin’s Church, and stole out on Sundays to\r\ndine with their bookseller. He avoided the society of authors. He spoke\r\nwith lordly contempt of the most distinguished among them. He tried to\r\nfind out some way of writing books, as M. Jourdain’s father sold cloth,\r\nwithout derogating from his character of _Gentilhomme_. “Lui, marchand?\r\nC’est pure médisance: il ne la jamais été. Tout ce qu’il faisait, c’est\r\nqu’il était fort obligeant, fort officieux; et comme il se connaissait\r\nfort bien en étoffes, il en allait choisir de tous les côtés, les\r\nfaisait apporter chez lui, et en donnait à ses amis pour de l’argent.”\r\n There are several amusing instances of Walpole’s feeling on this subject\r\nin the letters now before us. Mann had complimented him on the learning\r\nwhich appeared in the “Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors;” and it\r\nis curious to see how impatiently Walpole bore the imputation of having\r\nattended to any thing so unfashionable as the improvement of his mind.\r\n“I know nothing. How should I? I who have always lived in the big busy\r\nworld; who lie a-bed all the morning, calling it morning as long as you\r\nplease; who sup in company; who have played at faro half my life, and\r\nnow at loo till two and three in the morning; who have always loved\r\npleasure {151}haunted auctions.... How I have laughed when some of the\r\nMagazines have called me the learned gentleman. Pray don’t be like the\r\nMagazines.” This folly might be pardoned in a boy. But a man between\r\nforty and fifty years old, as Walpole then was, ought to be quite as\r\nmuch ashamed of playing at loo till three every morning as of being that\r\nvulgar thing, a learned gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe literary character has undoubtedly its full share of faults, and of\r\nvery serious and offensive faults. If Walpole had avoided those faults,\r\nwe could have pardoned the fastidiousness with which he declined all\r\nfellowship with men of learning. But from those faults Walpole was not\r\none jot more free than the garreteers from whose contact he shrank. Of\r\nliterary meannesses and literary vices, his life and his works contain\r\nas many instances as the life and the works of any member of Johnson’s\r\nclub. The fact is, that Walpole had the faults of Grub Street, with a\r\nlarge addition from St. James’s Street, the vanity, the jealousy, the\r\nirritability of a man of letters, the affected superciliousness and\r\napathy of a man of _ton_.\r\n\r\nHis judgment of literature, of contemporary literature especially, wars\r\naltogether perverted by his aristocratical feelings.\r\n\r\nNo writer surely was ever guilty of so much false and absurd criticism.\r\nHe almost invariably speaks with contempt of those books which are now\r\nuniversally allowed to be the best that appeared in his time; and, on\r\nthe other hand, he speaks of writers of rank and fashion as if they\r\nwere entitled to the same precedence in literature which would have been\r\nallowed to them in a drawing-room. In these letters, for example, he\r\nsays that he would rather have written the most absurd lines in Lee than\r\n{152}Thomson’s Seasons. The periodical paper called “The World,” on\r\nthe other hand, was by “our first writers.” Who, then, were the first\r\nwriters of England in the year 1758? Walpole has told us in a note. Our\r\nreaders will probably guess that Hume, Fielding, Smollett, Richardson,\r\nJohnson, Warburton, Collins, Akenside, Gray, Dyer, Young, Warton, Mason,\r\nor some of those distinguished men, were in the list. Not one of them.\r\nOur first writers, it seems, were Lord Chesterfield, Lord Bath, Mr.\r\nW. Whithed, Sir Charles Williams, Mr. Soame Jenyns, Mr. Cambridge, Mr.\r\nCoventry. Of these seven personages, Whithed was the lowest in station,\r\nbut was the most accomplished tuft-hunter of his time. Coventry was of\r\na noble family. The other five had among them two seats in the House\r\nof Lords, two seats in the House of Commons, three seats in the Privy\r\nCouncil, a baronetcy, a blue riband, a red riband, about a hundred\r\nthousand pounds a year, and not ten pages that are worth reading. The\r\nwritings of Whithed, Cambridge, Coventry, and Lord Bath are forgotten.\r\nSoame Jenyns is remembered chiefly by Johnson’s review of the foolish\r\nEssay on the Origin of Evil. Lord Chesterfield stands much lower in the\r\nestimation of posterity than he would have done if his letters had never\r\nbeen published. The lampoons of Sir Charles Williams are now read only\r\nby the curious, and, though not without occasional flashes of wit, have\r\nalways seemed to us, we must own, very poor performances.\r\n\r\nWalpole judged of French literature after the same fashion. He\r\nunderstood and loved the French language. Indeed, he loved it too well.\r\nHis style is more deeply tainted with Gallicism than that of any other\r\nEnglish writer with whom we are acquainted. {153}His composition often\r\nreads, for a page together, like a rude translation from the French.\r\nWe meet every minute with such sentences as these, “One knows what\r\ntemperaments Annibal Caracci painted.”\r\n\r\n“The impertinent personage!”\r\n\r\n“She is dead rich.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Dalkeith is dead of the small-pox in three days.”\r\n\r\n“It will not be seen whether he or they are most patriot.”\r\n\r\nHis love of the French language was of a peculiar kind. He loved it\r\nas having been for a century the vehicle of all the polite nothings of\r\nEurope, as the sign by which the freemasons of fashion recognised each\r\nother in every capital from Petersburg to Naples, as the language of\r\nraillery, as the language of anecdote, as the language of memoirs,\r\nas the language of correspondence. Its higher uses he altogether\r\ndisregarded. The literature of France has been to ours what Aaron was to\r\nMoses, the expositor of great truths which would else have perished\r\nfor want of a voice to utter them with distinctness. The relation which\r\nexisted between Mr. Bentham and M. Dumont is an exact illustration\r\nof the intellectual relation in which the two countries stand to each\r\nother. The great discoveries in physics, in metaphysics, in political\r\nscience, are ours. But scarcely any foreign nation except France\r\nhas received them from us, by direct communication. Isolated by our\r\nsituation, isolated by our manners, we found truth, but we did not\r\nimpart it. France has been the interpreter between England and mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Walpole, this process of interpretation was in full\r\nactivity. The great French writers were busy in proclaiming through\r\nEurope the names of Bacon, of Newton, and of Locke. The English\r\n{154}principles of toleration, the English respect for personal liberty,\r\nthe English doctrine that all power is a trust for the public good,\r\nwere making rapid progress. There is scarcely any thing in history\r\nso interesting as that great stirring up of the mind of France, that\r\nshaking of the foundations of all established opinions, that uprooting\r\nof old truth and old error. It was plain that mighty principles were at\r\nwork whether for evil or for good. It was plain that a great change\r\nin the whole social system was at hand. Fanatics of one kind might\r\nanticipate a golden age, in which men should live under the simple\r\ndominion of reason, in perfect equality and perfect amity, without\r\nproperty, or marriage, or king, or God. A fanatic of another kind\r\nmight see nothing in the doctrines of the philosophers but anarchy and\r\natheism, might cling more closely to every old abuse, and might regret\r\nthe good old days when St. Dominic and Simon de Montfort put down the\r\ngrowing heresies of Provence. A wise man would have seen with regret the\r\nexcesses into which the reformers were running; but he would have\r\ndone justice to their genius and to their philanthropy. He would have\r\ncensured their errors; but he would have remembered that, as Milton\r\nhas said, error is but opinion in the making. While he condemned their\r\nhostility to religion, he would have acknowledged that it was the\r\nnatural effect of a system under which religion had been constantly\r\nexhibited to them in forms which common sense rejected and at which\r\nhumanity shuddered. While he condemned some of their political doctrines\r\nas incompatible with all law, all property, and all civilisation, he\r\nwould have acknowledged that the subjects of Lewis the Fifteenth had\r\nevery excuse which men could have for being eager to pull down,\r\n{155}and for being ignorant of the far higher art of setting up. While\r\nanticipating a fierce conflict, a great and wide-wasting destruction,\r\nhe would yet have looked forward to the final close with a good hope for\r\nFrance and for mankind.\r\n\r\nWalpole had neither hopes nor fears. Though the most Frenchified English\r\nwriter of the eighteenth century, he troubled himself little about the\r\nportents which were daily to be discerned in the French literature\r\nof his time. While the most eminent Frenchmen were studying with\r\nenthusiastic delight English politics and English philosophy, he was\r\nstudying as intently the gossip of the old court of France. The fashions\r\nand scandal of Versailles and Marli, fashions and scandal a hundred\r\nyears old, occupied him infinitely more than a great moral revolution\r\nwhich was taking place in his sight. He took a prodigious interest in\r\nevery noble sharper whose vast volume of wig and infinite length of\r\nriband had figured at the dressing or at the tucking up of Lewis the\r\nFourteenth, and of every profligate woman of quality who had carried her\r\ntrain of lovers backward and forward from king to parliament, and from\r\nparliament to king during the wars of the Fronde. These were the people\r\nof whom he treasured up the smallest memorial, of whom he loved to hear\r\nthe most trifling anecdote, and for whose likenesses he would have given\r\nany price. Of the great French writers of his own time, Montesquieu is\r\nthe only one of whom he speaks with enthusiasm. And even of Montesquieu\r\nhe speaks with less enthusiasm than of that abject thing, Crébillon the\r\nyounger, a scribbler as licentious as Louvet and as dull as Rapin. A man\r\nmust be strangely constituted who can take interest in pedantic journals\r\nof the blockades laid by the Duke of A. to the hearts {156}of the\r\nMarquise de B. and the Comtesse de C. This trash Walpole extols in\r\nlanguage sufficiently high for the merits of Don Quixote. He wished\r\nto possess a likeness of Crebillon; and Liotard, the first painter of\r\nminiatures then living, was employed to preserve the features of\r\nthe profligate dunce. The admirer of the _Sopha_ and of the _Lettres\r\nAthéniennes_ had little respect to spare for the men who were then at\r\nthe head of French literature. He kept carefully out of their way. He\r\ntried to keep other people from paying them any attention. He could\r\nnot deny that Voltaire and Rousseau were clever men; but he took every\r\nopportunity of depreciating them. Of D’Alembert he spoke with a contempt\r\nwhich, when the intellectual powers of the two men are compared, seems\r\nexquisitely ridiculous. D’Alembert complained that he was accused of\r\nhaving written Walpole’s squib against Rousseau. “I hope,” says Walpole,\r\n“that nobody will attribute D’Alembert’s works to me.” He was in little\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny, however, that Walpole’s writings have real\r\nmerit, and merit of a very rare, though not of a very high kind. Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds used to say that, though nobody would for a moment\r\ncompare Claude to Raphael, there would be another Raphael before there\r\nwas another Claude. And we own that we expect to see fresh Humes and\r\nfresh Burkes before we again fall in with that peculiar combination of\r\nmoral and intellectual qualities to which the writings of Walpole owe\r\ntheir extraordinary popularity.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to describe him by negatives. He had not a creative\r\nimagination. He had not a pure taste. He was not a great reasoner. There\r\nis indeed scarcely any writer in whose works it would be possible\r\nto find {157}so many contradictory judgments, so many sentences of\r\nextravagant nonsense. Nor was it only in his familiar correspondence\r\nthat he wrote in this flighty and inconsistent manner, but in long and\r\nelaborate books, in books repeatedly transcribed and intended for the\r\npublic eye. We will give an instance or two; for without instances,\r\nreaders not very familiar with his works will scarcely understand our\r\nmeaning. In the Anecdotes of Painting, he states, very truly, that the\r\nart declined after the commencement of the civil wars. He proceeds to\r\ninquire why this happened. The explanation, we should have thought,\r\nwould have been easily found. He might have mentioned the loss of a king\r\nwho was the most munificent and judicious patron that the fine arts have\r\never had in England, the troubled state of the country, the distressed\r\ncondition of many of the aristocracy, perhaps also the austerity of the\r\nvictorious party. These circumstances, we conceive, fully account for\r\nthe phænomenon. But this solution was not odd enough to satisfy Walpole.\r\nHe discovers another cause for the decline of the art, the want of\r\nmodels. Nothing worth painting, it seems, was left to paint. “How\r\npicturesque,” he exclaims, “was the figure of an Anabaptist!”--as if\r\npuritanism had put out the sun and withered the trees; as if the civil\r\nwars had blotted out the expression of character and passion from the\r\nhuman lip and brow; as if many of the men whom Vandyke painted had not\r\nbeen living in the time of the Commonwealth, with faces little the worse\r\nfor wear; as if many of the beauties afterwards portrayed by Lely\r\nwere not in their prime before the Restoration; as if the garb or the\r\nfeatures of Cromwell and Milton were less picturesque than those of the\r\nround-faced peers, as like each other as {158}eggs to eggs, who look\r\nout from the middle of the periwigs of Kneller. In the Memoirs, again,\r\nWalpole sneers at the Prince of Wales, afterwards George the Third, for\r\npresenting a collection of books to one of the American colleges\r\nduring the Seven Years’ War, and says that, instead of books, His Royal\r\nHighness ought to have sent arms and ammunition; as if a war ought to\r\nsuspend all study and all education; or as if it was the business of the\r\nPrince of Wales to supply the colonies with military stores out of his\r\nown pocket. We have perhaps dwelt too long on these passages; but we\r\nhave done so because they are specimens of Walpole’s manner. Everybody\r\nwho reads his works with attention, will find that they swarm with\r\nloose, and foolish observations like those which we have cited;\r\nobservations which might pass in conversation or in a hasty letter,\r\nbut which are unpardonable in books deliberately written and repeatedly\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nHe appears to have thought that he saw very far into men; but we are\r\nunder the necessity of altogether dissenting from his opinion. We do\r\nnot conceive that he had any power of discerning the finer shades of\r\ncharacter. He practised an art, however, which, though easy and even\r\nvulgar, obtains for those who practise it the reputation of discernment\r\nwith ninety-nine people out of a hundred. He sneered at everybody, put\r\non every action the worst construction which it would bear, “spelt every\r\nman backward,” to borrow the Lady Hero’s phrase,\r\n\r\n                        “Turned every man the wrong side out,\r\n\r\n                   And never gave to truth and virtue that\r\n\r\n                   Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.”\r\n\r\nIn this way any man may, with little sagacity and little {159}trouble,\r\nbe considered by those whose good opinion is not worth having as a great\r\njudge of character.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the hasty and rapacious Kneller used to send away the\r\nladies who sate to him as soon as he had sketched their faces, and to\r\npaint the figure and hands from his housemaid. It was in much the same\r\nway that Walpole portrayed the minds of others. He copied from the life\r\nonly those glaring and obvious peculiarities which could not escape the\r\nmost superficial observation. The rest of the canvas he filled up, in a\r\ncareless dashing way, with knave and fool, mixed in such proportions as\r\npleased Heaven. What a difference between these daubs and the masterly\r\nportraits of Clarendon.\r\n\r\nThere are contradictions without end in the sketches of character which\r\nabound in Walpole’s works. But if we were to form our opinion of his\r\neminent contemporaries from a general survey of what he has written\r\nconcerning them, we should say that Pitt was a strutting, ranting,\r\nmouthing actor, Charles Townshend an impudent and voluble jack-pudding,\r\nMurray a demure, cold-blooded, cowardly hypocrite, Hardwicke an insolent\r\nupstart, with the understanding of a pettifogger and the heart of\r\na hangman, Temple an impertinent poltroon, Egmont a solemn coxcomb,\r\nLyttelton a poor creature whose only wish was to go to heaven in a\r\ncoronet, Onslow a pompous proser, Washington a braggart, Lord Camden\r\nsullen, Lord Townshend malevolent, Seeker an atheist who had shammed\r\nChristian for a mitre, Whitefield an impostor who swindled his converts\r\nout of their watches. The Walpoles fare little better than their\r\nneighbours. Old Horace is constantly represented as a coarse, brutal,\r\nniggardly buffoon, and his son as worthy of such a father. In short,\r\n{160}if we are to trust this discerning judge of human nature.\r\n\r\nEngland in his time contained little sense and no virtue, except what\r\nwas distributed between himself, Lord Waldgrave, and Marshal Conway.\r\n\r\nOf such a writer it is scarcely necessary to say, that his works\r\nare destitute of every charm which is derived from elevation or\r\nfrom tenderness of sentiment. When he chose to be humane, and\r\nmagnanimous,--for he sometimes, by way of variety, tried this\r\naffectation,--he overdid his part most ludicrously. None of his many\r\ndisguises sat so awkwardly upon him. For example, he tells us that he\r\ndid not choose to be intimate with Mr. Pitt. And why? Because Mr.\r\nPitt had been among the persecutors of his father? Or because, as he\r\nrepeatedly assures us, Mr. Pitt was a disagreeable man in private life?\r\nNot at all; but because Mr. Pitt was too fond of war, and was great\r\nwith too little reluctance. Strange that a habitual scoffer like Walpole\r\nshould imagine that this cant could impose on the dullest reader! If\r\nMolière had put such a speech into the mouth of Tartuffe, we should have\r\nsaid that the fiction was unskilful, and that Orgon could not have been\r\nsuch a fool as to be taken in by it. Of the twenty-six years during\r\nwhich Walpole sat in Parliament, thirteen were years of war. Yet he\r\ndid not, during all those thirteen years, utter a single word or give a\r\nsingle vote tending to peace. His most intimate friend, the only friend,\r\nindeed, to whom he appears to have been sincerely attached, Conway, was\r\na soldier, was fond of his profession, and was perpetually entreating\r\nMr. Pitt to give him employment. In this Walpole saw nothing but\r\nwhat was admirable. Conway was a hero for soliciting the command of\r\nexpeditions which Mr. Pitt was a monster for sending out. {161}What\r\nthan is the charm, the irresistible charm, of Walpole’s writings? It\r\nconsists, we think, in the art of amusing without exciting. He never\r\nconvinces the reason, or fills the imagination, or touches the heart;\r\nbut he keeps the mind of the reader constantly attentive and constantly\r\nentertained. He had a strange ingenuity peculiarly his own, an ingenuity\r\nwhich appeared in all that he did, in his building, in his gardening, in\r\nhis upholstery, in the matter and in the manner of his writings. If we\r\nwere to adopt the classification, not a very accurate classification,\r\nwhich Akenside has given of the pleasures of the imagination, we should\r\nsay that with the Sublime and the Beautiful Walpole had nothing to do,\r\nbut that the third province, the Odd, was his peculiar domain. The motto\r\nwhich he prefixed to his Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors might have\r\nbeen inscribed with perfect propriety over the door of every room in his\r\nhouse, and on the title-page of every one of his books; “Dove diavolo,\r\nMesser Ludovico, avete pigliate tante coglionerie?” In his villa, every\r\napartment is a museum; every piece of furniture is a curiosity: there\r\nis something strange in the form of the shovel; there is a long story\r\nbelonging to the bell-rope. We wander among a profusion of rarities, of\r\ntrifling intrinsic value, but so quaint in fashion, or connected\r\nwith such remarkable names and events, that they may well detain our\r\nattention for a moment. A moment is enough. Some new relic, some new\r\nunique, some new carved work, some new enamel, is forthcoming in an\r\ninstant. One cabinet of trinkets is no sooner closed than another is\r\nopened. It is the same with Walpole’s writings. It is not in their\r\nutility, it is not in their beauty, that their attraction lies. They are\r\nto the works of great historians {162}and poets, what Strawberry Hill is\r\nto the Museum of Sir Hans Sloane or to the Gallery of Florence. Walpole\r\nis constantly showing us things, not of very great value indeed, yet\r\nthings which we are pleased to see, and which we can see nowhere else.\r\nThey are baubles; but they are made curiosities either by his grotesque\r\nworkmanship or by some association belonging to them. His style is one\r\nof those peculiar styles by which every body is attracted, and which\r\nnobody can safely venture to imitate. He is a mannerist whose manner\r\nhas become perfectly easy to him. His affectation is so habitual and so\r\nuniversal that it can hardly be called affectation. The affectation\r\nis the essence of the man. It pervades all his thoughts and all his\r\nexpressions. If it were taken away, nothing would be left. He coins new\r\nwords, distorts the senses of old words, and twists sentences into forms\r\nwhich make grammarians stare. But all this he does, not only with an\r\nair of ease, but as if he could not help doing it. His wit was, in its\r\nessential properties, of the same kind with that of Cowley and Donne.\r\nLike theirs, it consisted in an exquisite perception of points of\r\nanal-ogv and points of contrast too subtile for common observation. Like\r\nthem, Walpole perpetually startles us by the ease with which he yokes\r\ntogether ideas between which there would seem, at first sight, to be no\r\nconnection. But he did not, like them, affect the gravity of a lecture,\r\nand draw his illustrations from the laboratory and from the schools. His\r\ntone was light and fleeting; his topics were the topics of the club and\r\nthe ball-room; and therefore his strange combinations and far-fetched\r\nallusions, though very closely resembling those which tire us to death\r\nin the poems of the time of Charles the First, are read with pleasure\r\nconstantly new. {163}No man who has written so much is so seldom\r\ntiresome. In his books there are scarcely any of those passages which,\r\nin our school days, we used to call _skip_. Yet he often wrote on\r\nsubjects which are generally considered as dull, on subjects which men\r\nof great talents have in vain endeavoured to render popular. When we\r\ncompare the Historic Doubts about Richard the Third with Whitaker’s and\r\nChalmers’s books on a far more interesting question, the character of\r\nMary Queen of Scots; when we compare the Anecdotes of Painting with the\r\nworks of Anthony Wood, of Nichols, of Granger, we at once see Walpole’s\r\nsuperiority, not in industry, not in learning, not in accuracy, not in\r\nlogical power, but in the art of writing what people will like to read.\r\nHe rejects all but the attractive parts of his subject. He keeps only\r\nwhat is in itself amusing, or what can be made so by the artifice of\r\nhis diction. The coarser morsels of antiquarian learning he abandons\r\nto others, and sets out an entertainment worthy of a Roman epicure,\r\nan entertainment consisting of nothing but delicacies, the brains of\r\nsinging birds, the roe of mullets, the sunny halves of peaches. This, we\r\nthink, is the great merit of his romance. There is little skill in\r\nthe delineation of the characters. Manfred is as commonplace a tyrant,\r\nJerome as commonplace a confessor, Theodore as commonplace a young\r\ngentleman, Isabella and Matilda as commonplace a pair of young ladies,\r\nas are to be found in any of the thousand Italian castles in which\r\n_condottieri_ have revelled or in which imprisoned duchesses have pined.\r\nWe cannot say that we much admire the big man whose sword is dug up in\r\none quarter of the globe, whose helmet drops from the clouds in another,\r\nand who, after clattering and rustling; {164}for some days, ends by\r\nkicking the house down. But the story, whatever its value may be, never\r\nflags for a single moment. There are no digressions, or unseasonable\r\ndescriptions, or long speeches. Every sentence carries the action\r\nforward. The excitement is constantly renewed. Absurd as is the\r\nmachinery, insipid as are the human actors, no reader probably ever\r\nthought the book dull.\r\n\r\nWalpole’s letters are generally considered as his best, performances,\r\nand, we think, with reason. His faults are far less offensive to us\r\nin his correspondence than in his books. His wild, absurd, and\r\never-changing opinions about men and things are easily pardoned in\r\nfamiliar letters. His bitter, scoffing, depreciating disposition does\r\nnot show itself in so unmitigated a manner as in his Memoirs. A writer\r\nof letters must in general be civil and friendly to his correspondent at\r\nleast, if to no other person.\r\n\r\nHe loved letter-writing, and had evidently studied it as an art. It\r\nwas, in truth, the very kind of writing for such a man, for a man very\r\nambitious to rank among wits, yet nervously afraid that, while obtaining\r\nthe reputation of a wit, he might lose caste as a gentleman. There was\r\nnothing vulgar in writing a letter. Not even Ensign Northerton, not\r\neven the Captain described in Hamilton’s Bawn,--and Walpole, though the\r\nauthor of many quartos, had some feelings in common with those gallant\r\nofficers,--would have denied that a gentleman might sometimes correspond\r\nwith a friend. Whether Walpole bestowed much labour on the composition\r\nof his letters, it is impossible to judge from internal evidence. There\r\nare passages which seem perfectly unstudied. But the appearance of\r\nease may be the effect of labour. There are passages which have a very\r\n{165}artificial air. But they may have been produced without effort by\r\na mind of which the natural ingenuity had been improved into morbid\r\nquickness by constant exercise. We are never sure that we see him as he\r\nwas. We are never sure that what appears to be nature is not disguised\r\nart. We are never sure that what appears to be art is not merely habit\r\nwhich has become second nature.\r\n\r\nIn wit and animation the present collection is not superior to those\r\nwhich have preceded it. But it has one great advantage over them all. It\r\nforms a connected whole, a regular journal of what appeared to Walpole\r\nthe most important transactions of the last twenty years of George the\r\nSecond’s reign. It furnishes much new information concerning the history\r\nof that time, the portion of English history of which common readers\r\nknow the least.\r\n\r\nThe earlier letters contain the most lively and interesting account\r\nwhich we possess of that “great Walpolean battle,” to use the words of\r\nJunius, which terminated in the retirement of Sir Robert. Horace entered\r\nthe House of Commons just in time to witness the last desperate struggle\r\nwhich his father, surrounded by enemies and traitors, maintained, with\r\na spirit as brave as that of the column of Fontenoy, first for victory,\r\nand then for honourable retreat. Horace was, of course, on the side of\r\nhis family. Lord Dover seems to have been enthusiastic on the same side,\r\nand goes so far as to call Sir Robert “the glory of the Whigs.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert deserved this high eulogium, we think, as little as he\r\ndeserved the abusive epithets which have often been coupled with his\r\nname. A fair character of him still remains to be drawn; and, whenever\r\nit shall be drawn, it will be equally unlike the portrait by Coxe and\r\nthe portrait by Smollett. {166}He had, undoubtedly, great talents and\r\ngreat virtues. He was not, indeed, like the leaders of the party which\r\nopposed his government, a brilliant orator. He was not a profound\r\nscholar, like Carteret, or a wit and a fine gentleman, like\r\nChesterfield. In all these respects his deficiencies were remarkable.\r\nHis literature consisted of a scrap or two of Horace and an anecdote\r\nor two from the end of the Dictionary. His knowledge of history was so\r\nlimited that, in the great debate on the Excise Bill, he was forced to\r\nask Attorney-General Yorke who Empson and Dudley were. His manners were\r\na little too coarse and boisterous even for that age of Westerns and\r\nTopehalls. When he ceased to talk of politics, he could talk of nothing\r\nbut women; and he dilated on his favourite theme with a freedom which\r\nshocked even that plain-spoken generation, and which was quite unsuited\r\nto his age and station. The noisy revelry of his summer festivities\r\nat Houghton gave much scandal to grave people, and annually drove his\r\nkinsman and colleague, Lord Townshend, from the neighbouring mansion of\r\nRainham.\r\n\r\nBut, however ignorant Walpole might be of general history and of general\r\nliterature, he was better acquainted than any man of his day with what\r\nit concerned him most to know, mankind, the English nation, the Court,\r\nthe House of Commons, and the Treasury. Of foreign affairs he knew\r\nlittle; but his judgment was so good that his little knowledge went\r\nvery far. He was an excellent parliamentary debater, an excellent\r\nparliamentary tactician, an excellent man of business. No man ever\r\nbrought more industry or more method to the transacting of affairs. No\r\nminister in his time did so much; yet no minister had so much leisure.\r\n{167}He was a good-natured man who had during thirty years seen nothing\r\nbut the worst parts of human nature in other men. He was familiar with\r\nthe malice of kind people, and the perfidy of honourable people. Proud\r\nmen had licked the dust before him. Patriots had begged him to come up\r\nto the price of their puffed and advertised integrity. He said after his\r\nfall that it was a dangerous thing to be a minister, that there were few\r\nminds which would not be injured by the constant spectacle of meanness\r\nand depravity. To his honour it must be confessed that few minds have\r\ncome out of such a trial so little damaged in the most important parts.\r\nHe retired, after more than twenty years of supreme power, with a temper\r\nnot soured, with a heart not hardened, with simple tastes, with frank\r\nmanners, and with a capacity for friendship. No stain of treachery, of\r\ningratitude, or of cruelty rests on his memory. Factious hatred, while\r\nflinging on his name every other foul aspersion, was compelled to own\r\nthat he was not a man of blood. This would scarcely seem a high\r\neulogium on a statesman of our times. It was then a rare and honourable\r\ndistinction. The contests of parties in England had long been carried on\r\nwith a ferocity unworthy of a civilised people. Sir Robert Walpole was\r\nthe minister who gave to our Government that character of lenity which\r\nit has since generally preserved. It was perfectly known to him that\r\nmany of his opponents had dealings with the Pretender. The lives of some\r\nwere at his mercy. He wanted neither Whig nor Tory precedents for using\r\nhis advantage unsparingly. But with a clemency to which posterity has\r\nnever done justice, he suffered himself to be thwarted, vilified, and at\r\nlast overthrown, by a party which included many men whose necks were\r\nin his power. {168}That he practised corruption on a large scale is, we\r\nthink, indisputable. But whether he deserves all the invectives which\r\nhave been uttered against him on that account may be questioned. No man\r\nought to be severely censured for not being beyond his age in virtue.\r\nTo buy the votes of constituents is as immoral as to buy the votes of\r\nrepresentatives. The candidate who gives five guineas to the freeman is\r\nas culpable as the man who gives three hundred guineas to the\r\nmember. Yet we know, that, in our time, no man is thought wicked or\r\ndishonourable, no man is cut, no man is black-balled, because, under\r\nthe old system of election, he was returned in the only way in which\r\nhe could be returned, for East Retford, for Liverpool, or for Stafford.\r\nWalpole governed by corruption, because, in his time, it was impossible\r\nto govern otherwise. Corruption was unnecessary to the Tudors; for their\r\nParliaments were feeble. The publicity which has of late years been\r\ngiven to parliamentary proceedings has raised the standard of morality\r\namong public men. The power of public opinion is so great that, even\r\nbefore the reform of the representation, a faint suspicion that a\r\nminister had given pecuniary gratifications to Members of Parliament in\r\nreturn for their votes would have been enough to ruin him. But, during\r\nthe century which followed the Restoration, the House of Commons was\r\nin that situation in which assemblies must be managed by corruption,\r\nor cannot be managed at all. It was not held in awe as in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, by the throne. It was not held in awe as in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, by the opinion of the people. Its constitution was\r\noligarchical. Its deliberations were secret. Its power in the State\r\nwas immense. The Government had every conceivable motive to offer\r\n{169}bribes. Many of the members, if they were not men of strict honour\r\nand probity, had no conceivable motive to refuse what the Government\r\noffered. In the reign of Charles the Second, accordingly, the practice\r\nof buying votes in the House of Commons was commenced by the daring\r\nClifford, and carried to a great extent by the crafty and shameless\r\nDanby. The Revolution, great and manifold as were the blessings of which\r\nit was directly or remotely the cause, at first aggravated this evil.\r\nThe importance of the House of Commons was now greater than ever. The\r\nprerogatives of the Crown were more strictly limited than ever; and\r\nthose associations in which, more than in its legal prerogatives, its\r\npower had consisted, were completely broken. No prince was ever in so\r\nhelpless and distressing a situation as William the Third. The party\r\nwhich defended his title was, on general grounds, disposed to curtail\r\nhis prerogative. The party which was, on general grounds, friendly to\r\nprerogative, was adverse to his title. There was no quarter in which\r\nboth his office and his person could find favour. But while the\r\ninfluence of the House of Commons in the Government was becoming\r\nparamount, the influence of the people over the House of Commons was\r\ndeclining. It mattered little in the time of Charles the First whether\r\nthat House were or were not chosen by the people; it was certain to act\r\nfor the people, because it would have been at the mercy of the Court but\r\nfor the support of the people. Now that the Court was at the mercy of\r\nthe House of Commons, those members who were not returned by popular\r\nelections had nobody to please but themselves. Even those who were\r\nreturned by popular election did not live, as now, under a constant\r\nsense of responsibility. The constituents were not, as now, daily\r\napprised {170}of the votes and speeches of their representatives. The\r\nprivileges which had in old times been indispensably necessary to the\r\nsecurity and efficiency of Parliaments were now superfluous. But\r\nthey were still carefully maintained, by honest legislators from\r\nsuperstitious veneration, by dishonest legislators for their own selfish\r\nends. They had been an useful defence to the Commons during a long and\r\ndoubtful conflict with powerful sovereigns. They were now no longer\r\nnecessary for that purpose; and they became a defence to the members\r\nagainst their constituents. That secrecy which had been absolutely\r\nnecessary in times when the Privy Council was in the habit of sending\r\nthe leaders of Opposition to the Tower was preserved in times when a\r\nvote of the House of Commons was sufficient to hurl the most powerful\r\nminister from his post.\r\n\r\nThe Government could not go on unless the Parliament could be kept in\r\norder. And how was the Parliament to be kept in order? Three hundred\r\nyears ago it would have been enough for a statesman to have the\r\nsupport of the Crown. It would now, we hope and believe, be enough for\r\nhim to enjoy the confidence and approbation of the great body of the\r\nmiddle class. A hundred years ago it would not have been enough to have\r\nboth Crown and people on his side. The Parliament had shaken off the\r\ncontrol of the Royal prerogative. It had not yet fallen under the\r\ncontrol of public opinion. A large proportion of the members had\r\nabsolutely no motive to support any administration except their own\r\ninterest, in the lowest sense of the word. Under these circumstances,\r\nthe country could be governed only by corruption. Bolingbroke, who was\r\nthe ablest and the most vehement of those who raised the clamour against\r\ncorruption, had no better remedy to {171}propose than that the Royal\r\nprerogative should be strengthened. The remedy would no doubt have been\r\nefficient. The only question is, whether it would not have been worse\r\nthan the disease. The fault was in the constitution of the Legislature;\r\nand to blame those ministers who managed the Legislature in the only\r\nway in which it could be managed is gross injustice. They submitted\r\nto extortion because they could not help themselves. We might as well\r\naccuse the poor Lowland farmers who paid black mail to Rob Roy of\r\ncorrupting the virtue of the Highlanders, as accuse Sir Robert Walpole\r\nof corrupting the virtue of Parliament. His crime was merely this, that\r\nhe employed his money more dexterously, and got more support in return\r\nfor it, than any of those who preceded or followed him.\r\n\r\nHe was himself incorruptible by money. His dominant passion was the love\r\nof power: and the heaviest charge which can be brought against him is\r\nthat to this passion he never scrupled to sacrifice the interests of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOne of the maxims which, as his son tells us, he was most in the habit\r\nof repeating, was, _quieta non movere_. It was indeed the maxim by which\r\nhe generally regulated his public conduct. It is the maxim of a man\r\nmore solicitous to hold power long than to use it well. It is remarkable\r\nthat, though he was at the head of affairs during more than twenty\r\nyears, not one great measure, not one important change for the better or\r\nfor the worse in any part of our institutions, marks the period of his\r\nsupremacy. Nor was this because he did not clearly see that many changes\r\nwere very desirable. He had been brought up in the school of toleration,\r\nat the feet of Somers and of Burnet. He disliked the shameful laws\r\nagainst Dissenters. But he never could {172}be induced to bring forward\r\na proposition for repealing them. The sufferers represented to him the\r\ninjustice with which they were treated, boasted of their firm attachment\r\nto the House of Brunswick and to the Whig party, and reminded him of\r\nhis own repeated declarations of good will to their cause. He listened,\r\nassented, promised, and did nothing. At length, the question was brought\r\nforward by others, and the Minister, after a hesitating and evasive\r\nspeech, voted against it. The truth was that he remembered to the latest\r\nday of his life that terrible explosion of high-church feeling which the\r\nfoolish prosecution of a foolish parson had occasioned in the days of\r\nQueen Anne. If the Dissenters had been turbulent he would probably have\r\nrelieved them: but while he apprehended no danger from them, he would\r\nnot run the slightest risk for their sake. He acted in the same manner\r\nwith respect to other questions. He knew the state of the Scotch\r\nHighlands. He was constantly predicting another insurrection in that\r\npart of the empire. Yet, during his long tenure of power, he never\r\nattempted to perform what was then the most obvious and pressing duty of\r\na British Statesman, to break the power of the Chiefs, and to establish\r\nthe authority of law through the furthest corners of the Island. Nobody\r\nknew better than he that, if this were not done, great mischiefs would\r\nfollow. But the Highlands were tolerably quiet in his time. He was\r\ncontent to meet daily emergencies by daily expedients; and he left the\r\nrest to his successors. They had to conquer the Highlands in the\r\nmidst of a war with France and Spain, because he had not regulated the\r\nHighlands in a time of profound peace.\r\n\r\nSometimes, in spite of all his caution, he found that measures which he\r\nhad hoped to carry through quietly {173}had caused great agitation. When\r\nthis was the case he generally modified or withdrew them. It was thus\r\nthat he cancelled Wood’s patent in compliance with the absurd outcry\r\nof the Irish. It was thus that he frittered away the Porteous Bill\r\nto nothing, for fear of exasperating the Scotch. It was thus that he\r\nabandoned the Excise Bill, as soon as he found that it was offensive to\r\nall the great towns of England. The language which he held about that\r\nmeasure in a subsequent session is strikingly characteristic. Pulteney\r\nhad insinuated that the scheme would be again brought forward. “As to\r\nthe wicked scheme,” said Walpole, “as the gentleman is pleased to call\r\nit, which he would persuade gentlemen is not yet laid aside, I for my\r\npart assure this House I am not so mad as ever again to engage in any\r\nthing that looks like an Excise; though, in my private opinion, I still\r\nthink it was a scheme that would have tended very much to the interest\r\nof the nation.” The conduct of Walpole with regard to the Spanish war is\r\nthe great blemish of his public life. Archdeacon Coxe imagined that he\r\nhad discovered one grand principle of action to which the whole public\r\nconduct of his hero ought to be referred. “Did the administration of\r\nWalpole,” says the biographer, “present any uniform principle which may\r\nbe traced in every part, and which gave combination and consistency to\r\nthe whole? Yes, and that principle was, The Love; of Peace.” It would be\r\ndifficult, we think, to bestow a higher eulogium on any statesman. But\r\nthe enlogimn is far too high for the merits of Walpole. The great ruling\r\nprinciple of his public conduct was indeed a love of peace, but not\r\nin the sense in which Archdeacon Coxe uses the phrase. The peace which\r\nWalpole sought was not the peace of the country, but the peace {174}of\r\nhis own administration. During the greater part of his public life,\r\nindeed, the two objects were inseparably connected. At length he was\r\nreduced to the necessity of choosing between them, of plunging the\r\nState into hostilities for which there was no just ground, and by which\r\nnothing was to be got, or of facing a violent opposition in the\r\ncountry, in Parliament, and even in the royal closet. No person was more\r\nthoroughly convinced than he of the absurdity of the cry against Spain.\r\nBut his darling power was at stake, and his choice was soon made. He\r\npreferred an unjust war to a stormy session. It is impossible to say\r\nof a Minister who acted thus that the love of peace was the one grand\r\nprinciple to which all his conduct is to be referred. The governing\r\nprinciple of his conduct was neither love of peace nor love of war, but\r\nlove of power.\r\n\r\nThe praise to which he is fairly entitled is this, that he understood\r\nthe tine interest of his country better than any of his contemporaries,\r\nand that he pursued that interest whenever it was not incompatible with\r\nthe interests of his own intense and grasping ambition. It was only in\r\nmatters of public moment that he shrank from agitation and had recourse\r\nto compromise. In his contests for personal influence there was no\r\ntimidity, no flinching. He would have all or none. Every member of the\r\nGovernment who would not submit to his ascendency was turned out or\r\nforced to resign. Liberal of every thing else, he was avaricious of\r\npowers Cautious everywhere else, when power was at stake he had all\r\nthe boldness of Richelieu or Chatham. He might easily have secured his\r\nauthority if he could have been induced to divide it with others. But he\r\nwould not part with one fragment of it to purchase defenders for all the\r\nrest. The effect of this policy {175}was that he had able enemies and\r\nfeeble allies. His most distinguished coadjutors left him one by one,\r\nand joined the ranks of the Opposition. He faced the increasing array\r\nof his enemies with unbroken spirit, and thought it far better that they\r\nshould attack his power than that they should share it.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition was In every sense formidable. At its head were two royal\r\npersonages, the exiled head of the House of Stuart, the disgraced heir\r\nof the House of Brunswick. One set of members received directions from\r\nAvignon. Another set held their consultations and banquets at Norfolk\r\nHouse. The majority of the landed gentry, the majority of the parochial\r\nclergy, one of the universities, and a strong party in the City of\r\nLondon and in the other great towns, were decidedly adverse to the\r\nGovernment. Of the men of letters, some were exasperated by the neglect\r\nwith which the Minister treated them, a neglect which was the more\r\nremarkable, because his predecessors, both Whig and Tory, had paid court\r\nwith emulous munificence to the wits and the poets; others were honestly\r\ninflamed by party zeal; almost all lent their aid to the Opposition. In\r\ntruth, all that was alluring to ardent and imaginative minds was on that\r\nside; old associations, new visions of political improvement, high-flown\r\ntheories of loyalty, high-flown theories of liberty, the enthusiasm of\r\nthe Cavalier, the enthusiasm of the Roundhead. The Tory gentleman,\r\nfed in the common-rooms of Oxford with the doctrines of Filmer and\r\nSacheverell, and proud of the exploits of his great grandfather, who\r\nhad charged with Rupert at Marston, who had held out the old manor-house\r\nagainst Fairfax, and who, after the King’s return, had been set down for\r\na Knight of the Royal Oak, flew to that section of the {176}opposition\r\nwhich, under pretence of assailing the existing administration, was in\r\ntruth assailing the reigning dynasty. The young republican, fresh from\r\nhis Livy and his Lucan, and glowing with admiration of Hampden, of\r\nRussell, and of Sydney, hastened with equal eagerness to those benches\r\nfrom which eloquent voices thundered nightly against the tyranny and\r\nperfidy of courts. So many young politicians were caught by these\r\ndeclamations that Sir Robert, in one of his best speeches, observed that\r\nthe opposition consisted of three bodies, the Tories, the discontented\r\nWhigs, who were known by the name of the Patriots, and the Boys. In fact\r\nalmost every young man of warm temper and lively imagination, whatever\r\nhis political bias might be, was drawn into the party adverse to the\r\nGovernment; and some of the most distinguished among them, Pitt, for\r\nexample, among public men, and Johnson, among men of letters, afterwards\r\nopenly acknowledged their mistake.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the Opposition, even while it was still a minority in the\r\nHouse of Commons, was very imposing. Among those who, in Parliament\r\nor out of Parliament, assailed the administration of Walpole, were\r\nBolingbroke, Carteret, Chesterfield, Argyle, Pulteney, Wyndham,\r\nDoddington, Pitt, Lyttelton, Barnard, Pope, Swift, Gay, Arbutlmot,\r\nFielding, Johnson, Thomson, Akenside, Glover.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that the Opposition was divided into two parties,\r\ndiametrically opposed to each other in political opinions, was long the\r\nsafety of Walpole. It was at last his ruin. The leaders of the minority\r\nknew that it would be difficult for them to bring forward any important\r\nmeasure without producing an immediate schism in their party. It was\r\nwith very {177}great difficulty that the Whigs in opposition had\r\nbeen induced to give a sullen and silent vote for the repeal of the\r\nSeptennial Act. The Tories, on the other hand, could not be induced\r\nto support Pulteney’s motion for an addition to the income of Prince\r\nFrederic. The two parties had cordially joined in calling out for a war\r\nwith Spain; but they now had their war. Hatred of Walpole was almost\r\nthe only feeling which was common to them. On this one point, therefore,\r\nthey concentrated their whole strength. With gross ignorance, or gross\r\ndishonesty, they represented the Minister as the main grievance of the\r\nstate. His dismissal, his punishment, would prove the certain cure for\r\nall the evils which the nation suffered. What was to be done after his\r\nfall, how misgovernment was to be prevented in future, were questions\r\nto which there were as many answers as there were noisy and ill-informed\r\nmembers of the Opposition. The only cry in which all could join was,\r\n“Down with Walpole!” So much did they narrow the disputed ground, so\r\npurely personal did they make the question, that they threw out friendly\r\nhints to the other members of the Administration, and declared that they\r\nrefused quarter to the Prime Minister alone. His tools might keep their\r\nheads, their fortunes, even their places, if only the great father of\r\ncorruption were given up to the just vengeance of the nation.\r\n\r\nIf the fate of Walpole’s colleagues had been inseparably bound up with\r\nhis, he probably would, even after the unfavourable elections of 1744,\r\nhave been able to weather the storm. But as soon as it was understood\r\nthat the attack was directed against him alone, and that, if he were\r\nsacrificed, his associates might expect advantageous and honourable\r\nterms, {178}the ministerial ranks began to waver, and the murmur\r\nof _sauve qui peat_ was heard. That Walpole had foul play is almost\r\ncertain, but to what extent it is difficult to say. Lord Islay was\r\nsuspected; the Duke of Newcastle something more than suspected. It would\r\nhave been strange, indeed, if his Grace had been idle when treason was\r\nhatching.\r\n\r\n                   “Ch’ i’ ho de’ traditor’ sempre sospetto,\r\n\r\n                   E Gan fu traditor prima che nato.”\r\n\r\n“His name,” said Sir Robert, “is perfidy.”\r\n\r\nNever was a battle more manfully fought out than the last struggle of\r\nthe old statesman. His clear judgment, his long experience, and his\r\nfearless spirit, enabled him to maintain a defensive war through half\r\nthe session. To the last his heart never failed him; and, when at last\r\nhe yielded, he yielded not to the threats of his enemies, but to the\r\nentreaties of his dispirited and refractory followers. When he could\r\nno longer retain his power, he compounded for honour and security,\r\nand retired to his garden and his paintings, leaving to those who had\r\noverthrown him shame, discord, and ruin.\r\n\r\nEvery thing was in confusion. It has been said that the confusion was\r\nproduced by the dexterous policy of Walpole; and, undoubtedly, he did\r\nhis best to sow dissension amongst his triumphant enemies. Rut there was\r\nlittle for him to do. Victory had completely dissolved the hollow truce,\r\nwhich the two sections of the Opposition had but imperfectly observed,\r\neven while the event of the contest was still doubtful. A thousand\r\nquestions were opened in a moment. A thousand conflicting claims were\r\npreferred. It was impossible to follow any line of policy which would\r\nnot have been offensive to a large portion {179}of the successful party.\r\nIt was impossible to find places for a tenth part of those who thought\r\nthat they had a right to office. While the parliamentary leaders were\r\npreaching patience and confidence, while their followers were clamouring\r\nfor reward, a still louder voice was heard from without, the terrible\r\ncry of a people angry, they hardly knew with whom, and impatient they\r\nhardly knew for what. The day of retribution had arrived. The Opposition\r\nreaped that which they had sown. Inflamed with hatred and cupidity,\r\ndespairing of success by any ordinary mode of political warfare, and\r\nblind to consequences which, though remote, were certain, they had\r\nconjured up a devil whom they could not lay. They had made the public\r\nmind drunk with calumny and declamation. They had raised expectations\r\nwhich it was impossible to satisfy. The downfall of Walpole was to\r\nbe the beginning of a political millennium; and every enthusiast had\r\nfigured to himself that millennium according to the fashion of his own\r\nwishes. The republican expected that the power of the Crown would\r\nbe reduced to a mere shadow, the high Tory that the Stuarts would be\r\nrestored, the moderate Tory that the golden days which the Church and\r\nthe landed interest had enjoyed during the last years of Queen Anne,\r\nwould immediately return. It would have been impossible to satisfy\r\neverybody. The conquerors satisfied nobody We have no reverence for\r\nthe memory of those who were then called the patriots. We are for the\r\nprinciples of good government against Walpole, and for Walpole against\r\nthe Opposition. It was most desirable that a purer system should be\r\nintroduced; but, if the old system was to be retained, no man was so fit\r\nas Walpole to be at the head of affairs. There {180}were grievous abuses\r\nin the government, abuses more than sufficient to justify a strong\r\nopposition. But the party opposed to Walpole, while they stimulated the\r\npopular fury to the highest point, were at no pains to direct it aright.\r\nIndeed they studiously misdirected it. They misrepresented the evil.\r\nThey prescribed inefficient and pernicious remedies. They held up a\r\nsingle man as the sole cause of all the vices of a bad system which had\r\nbeen in full operation before his entrance into public life, and which\r\ncontinued to be in full operation when some of these very brawlers had\r\nsucceeded to his power. They thwarted his best measures. They drove\r\nhim into an unjustifiable war against his will. Constantly talking\r\nin magnificent language about tyranny, corruption, wicked ministers,\r\nservile courtiers, the liberty of Englishmen, the Great Charter, the\r\nrights for which our fathers bled, Timoleon, Brutus, Hampden, Sydney,\r\nthey had absolutely nothing to propose which would have been an\r\nimprovement on our institutions. Instead of directing the public mind to\r\ndefinite reforms which might have completed the work of the revolution,\r\nwhich might have brought the legislature into harmony with the nation,\r\nand which might have prevented the Crown from doing by influence what\r\nit could no longer do by prerogative, they excited a vague craving for\r\nchange, by which they profited for a single moment, and of which, as\r\nthey well deserved, they were soon the victims.\r\n\r\nAmong the reforms which the state then required, there were two of\r\nparamount importance, two which would alone have remedied almost every\r\ngross abuse, and without which all other remedies would have been\r\nunavailing, the publicity of parliamentary proceedings, and the\r\nabolition of the rotten boroughs. Neither of {181}these was thought of.\r\nIt seems to us clear that, if these were not adopted, all other measures\r\nwould have been illusory. Some of the patriots suggested changes which\r\nwould, beyond all doubt, have increased the existing evils a hundred\r\nfold. These men wished to transfer the disposal of employments and the\r\ncommand of the army from the Crown to the Parliament; and this on the\r\nvery ground that the Parliament had long been a grossly corrupt body.\r\nThe security against malpractices was to be that the members, instead of\r\nhaving a portion of the public plunder doled out to them by a minister,\r\nwere to help themselves.\r\n\r\nThe other schemes of which the public mind was full were less dangerous\r\nthan this. Some of them were in themselves harmless. But none of them\r\nwould have done much good, and most of them were extravagantly absurd.\r\nWhat they were we may learn from the instructions which many constituent\r\nbodies, immediately after the change of administration, sent up to their\r\nrepresentatives. A more deplorable collection of follies can hardly\r\nbe imagined. There is, in the first place, a general cry for Walpole’s\r\nhead. Then there are bitter complaints of the decay of trade, a decay\r\nwhich, in the judgment of these enlightened politicians, was brought\r\nabout by Walpole and corruption. They would have been nearer to the\r\ntruth if they had attributed their sufferings to the war into which\r\nthey had driven Walpole against his better judgment. He had foretold the\r\neffects of his unwilling concession. On the day when hostilities against\r\nSpain were proclaimed, when the heralds were attended into the city by\r\nthe chiefs of the Opposition, when the Prince of Wales himself stopped\r\nat Temple-Bar to drink success to the English arms, the Minister\r\n{182}heard all the steeples of the city jingling with a merry peal, and\r\nmuttered, “They may ring the bells now: they will be wringing their hands\r\nbefore long.”\r\n\r\nAnother grievance, for which of course Walpole and corruption were\r\nanswerable, was the great exportation of English wool. In the judgment\r\nof the sagacious electors of several large towns, the remedying of\r\nthis evil was a matter second only in importance, to the hanging of Sir\r\nRobert. There were also earnest injunctions that the members should vote\r\nagainst standing armies in time of peace, injunctions which were, to\r\nsay the least, ridiculously unseasonable in the midst of a war which was\r\nlikely to last, and which did actually last, as long as the Parliament.\r\nThe repeal of the Septennial Act, as was to be expected, was strongly\r\npressed. Nothing was more natural than that the voters should wish for\r\na triennial recurrence of their bribes and their ale. We feel firmly\r\nconvinced that the repeal of the Septennial Act, unaccompanied by a\r\ncomplete reform of the constitution of the elective body, would have\r\nbeen an unmixed curse to the country. The only rational recommendation\r\nwhich we can find in all these instructions is that the number of\r\nplacemen in Parliament should be limited, and that pensioners should not\r\nbe allowed to sit there. It is plain, however, that this cure was far\r\nfrom going to the root of the evil, and that, if it had been adopted\r\nwithout other reforms, secret bribery would probably have been more\r\npractised than ever.\r\n\r\nWe will give one more instance of the absurd expectations which the\r\ndeclamations of the Opposition had raised in the country. Akenside\r\nwas one of the fiercest and most uncompromising of the young patriots\r\n{183}out of Parliament. When he found that the change of administration\r\nhad produced no change of system, he gave vent to his indignation in the\r\n“Epistle to Curio,” the best poem that he ever wrote, a poem, indeed,\r\nwhich seems to indicate, that, if he had left lyric composition to Gray\r\nand Collins, and had employed his powers in grave and elevated satire,\r\nhe might have disputed the preéminence of Dryden. But whatever be the\r\nliterary merits of the epistle, we can say nothing in praise of the\r\npolitical doctrines which it inculcates. The poet, in a rapturous\r\napostrophe to the spirits of the great men of antiquity, tells us what\r\nhe expected from Pulteney at the moment of the fall of the tyrant.\r\n\r\n                   “See private life by wisest arts reclaimed,\r\n\r\n                   See ardent youth to noblest manners framed,\r\n\r\n                   See us achieve whate’er was sought by you,\r\n\r\n                   If Curio--only Curio--will be true.”\r\n\r\nIt was Pulteney’s business, it seems, to abolish faro and masquerades,\r\nto stint the young Duke of Marlborough to a bottle of brandy a day, and\r\nto prevail on Lady Vane to be content with three lovers at a time.\r\n\r\nWhatever the people wanted, they certainly got nothing. Walpole retired\r\nin safety; and the multitude were defrauded of the expected show on\r\nTower Hill. The Septennial Act was not repealed. The placemen were\r\nnot turned out of the House of Commons. Wool, we believe, was still\r\nexported. “Private lift;” afforded as much scandal as if the reign of\r\nWalpole and corruption had continued; and “ardent youth” fought with\r\nwatchmen and betted with blacklegs as much as ever.\r\n\r\nThe colleagues of Walpole had, after his retreat, admitted some of\r\nthe chiefs of the Opposition into the {184}Government, and soon found\r\nthemselves compelled to submit to the ascendency of one of their new\r\nallies. This was Lord Carteret, afterwards Earl Granville. No public\r\nman of that age had greater courage, greater ambition, greater activity,\r\ngreater talents for debate or for declamation. No public man had such\r\nprofound and extensive learning. He was familiar with the ancient\r\nwriters, and loved to sit up till midnight discussing philological and\r\nmetrical questions with Bentley. His knowledge of modern languages\r\nwas prodigious. The privy council, when he was present, needed no\r\ninterpreter. He spoke and wrote French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,\r\nGerman, even Swedish. He had pushed his researches into the most obscure\r\nnooks of literature. He was as familiar with Canonists and Schoolmen as\r\nwith orators and poets. He had read all that the universities of Saxony\r\nand Holland had produced on the most intricate questions of public law.\r\nHarte, in the preface to the second edition of his History of Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, bears a remarkable testimony to the extent and accuracy of\r\nLord Carteret’s knowledge. “It was my good fortune or prudence to keep\r\nthe main body of my army (or in other words my matters of fact) safe\r\nand entire. The late Earl of Granville was pleased to declare himself of\r\nthis opinion; especially when he found that I had made Chemnitius one of\r\nmy principal guides; for his Lordship was apprehensive I might not have\r\nseen that valuable and authentic book, which is extremely scarce. I\r\nthought myself happy to have contented his Lordship even in the lowest\r\ndegree: for he understood the German and Swedish histories to the\r\nhighest perfection.”\r\n\r\nWith all this learning, Carteret was far from being a pedant. His was\r\nnot one of those cold spirits of which {185}the fire is put out by the\r\nfuel. In council, in debate, in society, he was all life and energy.\r\nHis measures were strong, prompt, and daring, his oratory animated and\r\nglowing. His spirits were constantly high. No misfortune, public or\r\nprivate, could depress him. He was at once the most unlucky and the\r\nhappiest public man of his time.\r\n\r\nHe had been Secretary of State in Walpole’s Administration, and had\r\nacquired considerable influence over the mind of George the First. The\r\nother ministers could speak no German. The King could speak no English.\r\nAll the communication that Walpole held with his master was in very bad\r\nLatin. Carteret dismayed his colleagues by the volubility with which he\r\naddressed his Majesty in German. They listened with envy and terror to\r\nthe mysterious gutturals which might possibly convey suggestions very\r\nlittle in unison with their wishes.\r\n\r\nWalpole was not a man to endure such a colleague as Carteret. The King\r\nwas induced to give up his favourite. Carteret joined the Opposition,\r\nand signalised himself at the head of that party till, after the\r\nretirement of his old rival, he again became Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nDuring some months he was chief Minister, indeed sole Minister. He\r\ngained the confidence and regard of George the Second. He was at the\r\nsame time in high favour with the Prince of Wales. As a debater in\r\nthe House of Lords, he had no equal among his colleagues. Among\r\nhis opponents, Chesterfield alone could be considered as his match.\r\nConfident in his talents, and in the royal favour, he neglected\r\nall those means by which the power of Walpole had been created and\r\nmaintained. His head was full of treaties {186}and expeditions, of\r\nschemes for supporting the Queen of Hungary and for humbling the House\r\nof Bourbon. He contemptuously abandoned to others all the drudgery, and,\r\nwith the drudgery, all the fruits of corruption. The patronage of the\r\nChurch and of the Bar he left to the Pelhams as a trifle unworthy of his\r\ncare. One of the judges, Chief Justice Willes, if we remember rightly,\r\nwent to him to beg some ecclesiastical preferment for a friend. Carteret\r\nsaid, that he was too much occupied with continental politics to think\r\nabout the disposal of places and benefices. “You may rely on it, then,”\r\n said the Chief Justice, “that people who want places and benefices will\r\ngo to those who have more leisure.” The prediction was accomplished.\r\nIt would have been a busy time indeed in which the Pelhams had wanted\r\nleisure for jobbing; and to the Pelhams the whole cry of place-hunters\r\nand pension-hunters resorted. The parliamentary influence of the two\r\nbrothers became stronger every day, till at length they were at the head\r\nof a decided majority in the House of Commons. Their rival, meanwhile,\r\nconscious of his powers, sanguine in his hopes, and proud of the storm\r\nwhich he had conjured up on the Continent, would brook neither superior\r\nnor equal. “His rants,” says Horace Walpole, “are amazing; so are his\r\nparts and his spirits.” He encountered the opposition of his colleagues,\r\nnot with the fierce haughtiness of the first Pitt, or the cold unbending\r\narrogance of the second, but with a gay vehemence, a good-humoured\r\nimperiousness, that bore every thing down before it. The period of his\r\nascendency was known by the name of the “Drunken Administration;” and\r\nthe expression was not altogether figurative. His habits were extremely\r\nconvivial; and champagne probably lent its aid to keep {187}him in that\r\nstate of joyous excitement in which his life was passed.\r\n\r\nThat a rash and impetuous man of genius like Carteret should not have\r\nbeen able to maintain his ground in Parliament against the crafty and\r\nselfish Pelhams is not strange. But it is less easy to understand why\r\nhe should have been generally unpopular throughout the country. His\r\nbrilliant talents, his bold and open temper, ought, it should seem,\r\nto have made him a favourite with the public. But the people had been\r\nbitterly disappointed; and he had to face the first burst of their rage.\r\nHis close connection with Pulteney, now the most detested man in the\r\nnation, was an unfortunate circumstance. He had, indeed, only three\r\npartisans, Pulteney, the King, and the Prince of Wales, a most singular\r\nassemblage.\r\n\r\nHe was driven from his office. He shortly after made a bold, indeed a\r\ndesperate, attempt to recover power. The attempt failed. From that time\r\nhe relinquished all ambitious hopes, and retired laughing to his books\r\nand his bottle. No statesman ever enjoyed success with so exquisite\r\na relish, or submitted to defeat with so genuine and unforced a\r\ncheerfulness. Ill as he had been used, he did not seem, says Horace\r\nWalpole, to have any resentment, or indeed any feeling except thirst.\r\n\r\nThese letters contain many good stories, some of them, no doubt, grossly\r\nexaggerated, about Lord Carteret; how, in the height of his greatness,\r\nhe fell in love at first sight on a birthday with Lady Sophia Fermor,\r\nthe handsome daughter of Lord Pomfret; how he plagued the Cabinet\r\nevery day with reading to them her ladyship’s letters; how strangely\r\nhe brought home his bride; what fine jewels he gave her; how {188}he\r\nfondled her at Ranelagh; and what queen-like state she kept in Arlington\r\nStreet. Horace Walpole has spoken less bitterly of Carteret than of\r\nany public man of that time, Fox perhaps excepted; and this is the more\r\nremarkable, because Carteret was one of the most inveterate enemies of\r\nSir Robert. In the Memoirs, Horace Walpole, after passing in review all\r\nthe great men whom England had produced within his memory, concludes by\r\nsaying, that in genius none of them equalled Lord Granville. Smollett,\r\nin Humphrey Clinker, pronounces a similar judgment in coarser language.\r\n“Since Granville was turned out, there has been no minister in this\r\nnation worth the meal that whitened his periwig.”\r\n\r\nCarteret fell: and the reign of the Pelhams commenced. It was Carteret’s\r\nmisfortune to be raised to power when the public mind was still smarting\r\nfrom recent disappointment. The nation had been duped, and was eager for\r\nrevenge. A victim was necessary, and on such occasions the victims of\r\npopular rage are selected like the victim of Jephthah. The first person\r\nwho comes in the way is made the sacrifice. The wrath of the people\r\nhad now spent itself; and the unnatural excitement was succeeded by an\r\nunnatural calm. To an irrational eagerness for something new,\r\nsucceeded an equally irrational disposition to acquiesce in every thing\r\nestablished. A few months back the people had been disposed to impute\r\nevery crime to men in power, and to lend a ready ear to the high\r\nprofessions of men in opposition. They were now disposed to surrender\r\nthemselves implicitly to the management of Ministers, and to look with\r\nsuspicion and contempt on all who pretended to public spirit. The name\r\nof patriot had become a by-word of derision. Horace Walpole scarcely\r\n{189}exaggerated when he said that, in those times, the most popular\r\ndeclaration which a candidate could make on the hustings was that he had\r\nnever been and never would be a patriot. At this conjuncture took place\r\nthe rebellion of the Highland clans. The alarm produced by that\r\nevent quieted the strife of internal factions. The suppression of the\r\ninsurrection crushed for ever the spirit of the Jacobite party. Room\r\nwas made in the Government for a few Tories. Peace was patched up with\r\nFrance and Spain. Death removed the Prince of Wales, who had contrived\r\nto keep together a small portion of that formidable opposition of which\r\nhe had been the leader in the time of Sir Robert Walpole. Almost every\r\nman of weight in the House of Commons was officially connected with the\r\nGovernment. The even tenor of the session of Parliament was ruffled only\r\nby an occasional harangue from Lord Egmont on the army estimates.\r\nFor the first time since the accession of the Stuarts there was no\r\nopposition. This singular good fortune, denied to the ablest statesmen,\r\nto Salisbury, to Strafford, to Clarendon, to Somers, to Walpole, had\r\nbeen reserved for the Pelhams.\r\n\r\nHenry Pelham, it is true, was by no means a contemptible person. His\r\nunderstanding was that of Walpole on a somewhat smaller scale. Though\r\nnot a brilliant orator, he was, like his master, a good debater, a good\r\nparliamentary tactician, a good man of business. Like his master he\r\ndistinguished himself by the neatness and clearness of his financial\r\nexpositions. Here the resemblance ceased. Their characters were\r\naltogether dissimilar. Walpole was good-humoured, but would have his\r\nway: his spirits were high, and his manners frank even to coarseness.\r\nThe temper of Pelham was yielding, but peevish: his habits were regular,\r\nand his {190}deportment strictly decorous. Walpole was constitutionally\r\nfearless, Pelham constitutionally timid. Walpole had to face a strong\r\nopposition; but no man in the Government durst wag a finger against him.\r\nAlmost all the opposition which Pelham had to encounter was from members\r\nof the Government of which he was the head. His own paymaster spoke\r\nagainst his estimates. His own secretary-at-war spoke against his\r\nRegency Bill. In one day Walpole turned Lord Chesterfield, Lord\r\nBurlington, and Lord Clinton out of the royal household, dismissed the\r\nhighest dignitaries of Scotland from their posts, and took away the\r\nregiments of the Duke of Bolton and Lord Cobham, because he suspected\r\nthem of having encouraged the resistance to his Excise Bill. He would\r\nfar rather have contended with the strongest minority, under the ablest\r\nleaders, than have tolerated mutiny in his own party. It would have\r\ngone hard with any of his colleagues, who had ventured, on a Government\r\nquestion, to divide the House of Commons against him. Pelham, on the\r\nother hand, was disposed to bear any thing rather than drive from office\r\nany man round whom a new opposition could form. He therefore endured\r\nwith fretful patience the insubordination of Pitt and Fox. He thought it\r\nfar better to connive at their occasional infractions of discipline\r\nthan to hear them, night after night, thundering against corruption and\r\nwicked ministers from the other side of the House.\r\n\r\nWe wonder that Sir Walter Scott never tried his hand on the Duke of\r\nNewcastle. An interview between his Grace and Jeanie Deans would have\r\nbeen delightful, and by no means unnatural. There is scarcely any public\r\nman in our history of whose manners and conversation so many\r\nparticulars have been {191}preserved. Single stories may be unfounded or\r\nexaggerated. But all the stories about him, whether told by people who\r\nwere perpetually seeing him in Parliament and attending his levee in\r\nLincoln’s Inn Fields, or by Grub Street writers who never had more than\r\na glimpse of his star through the windows of his gilded coach, are of\r\nthe same character. Horace Walpole and Smollett differed in their tastes\r\nand opinions as much as two human beings could differ. They kept\r\nquite different society. Walpole played at cards with countesses, and\r\ncorresponded with ambassadors. Smollett passed his life surrounded\r\nby printer’s devils and famished scribblers. Yet Walpole’s Duke\r\nand Smollett’s Duke are as like as if they were both from one hand.\r\nSmollett’s Newcastle runs out of his dressing-room, with his face\r\ncovered with soap-suds, to embrace the Moorish envoy. Walpole’s\r\nNewcastle pushes his way into the Duke of Grafton’s sick room to kiss\r\nthe old nobleman’s plasters. No man was so unmercifully satirised. But\r\nin truth he was himself a satire ready made. All that the art of the\r\nsatirist does for other men, nature had done for him. Whatever was\r\nabsurd about him stood out with grotesque prominence from the rest of\r\nthe character. He was a living, moving, talking, caricature. His gait\r\nwas a shuffling trot; his utterance a rapid stutter; he was always in\r\na hurry; he was never in time; he abounded in fulsome caresses and in\r\nhysterical tears. His oratory resembled that of Justice Shallow. It\r\nwas nonsense effervescent with animal spirits and impertinence. Of his\r\nignorance many anecdotes remain, some well authenticated, some probably\r\ninvented at coffee-houses, but all exquisitely characteristic.\r\n“Oh--yes--yes--to be sure--Annapolis must be defended--troops must\r\nbe {192}sent to Annapolis--Pray where is Annapolis?”--“Cape Breton an\r\nisland! wonderful!--show it me in the map. So it is, sure enough. My\r\ndear sir, you always bring us good news. I must go and tell the King\r\nthat Cape Breton is an island.”\r\n\r\nAnd this man was, during near thirty years, Secretary of State, and,\r\nduring near ten years, First Lord of the Treasury! His large fortune,\r\nhis strong hereditary connection, his great parliamentary interest,\r\nwill not alone explain this extraordinary fact. His success is a signal\r\ninstance of what may be effected by a man who devotes his whole heart\r\nand soul without reserve to one object. He was eaten up by ambition. His\r\nlove of influence and authority resembled the avarice of the old usurer\r\nin the Fortunes of Nigel. It was so intense a passion that it supplied\r\nthe place of talents, that it inspired even fatuity with cunning. “Have\r\nno money dealings with my father,” says Martha to Lord Glenvarloch;\r\n“for, dotard as he is, he will make an ass of you.” It was as dangerous\r\nto have any political connection with Newcastle as to buy and sell with\r\nold Trapbois. He was greedy after power with a greediness all his own.\r\nHe was jealous of all his colleagues, and even of his own brother. Under\r\nthe disguise of levity he was false beyond all example of political\r\nfalsehood. All the able men of his time ridiculed him as a dunce, a\r\ndriveller, a child who never knew his own mind for an hour together; and\r\nhe overreached them all round.\r\n\r\nIf the country had remained at peace, it is not impossible that this man\r\nwould have continued at the head of affairs without admitting any other\r\nperson to a share of his authority until the throne was filled by a\r\nnew Prince, who brought with him new maxims of {193}government, new\r\nfavourites, and a strong will. But the inauspicious commencement of the\r\nSeven Years’ War brought on a crisis to which Newcastle was altogether\r\nunequal. After a calm of fifteen years the spirit of the nation was\r\nagain stirred to its inmost depths. In a few days the whole aspect of\r\nthe political world was changed.\r\n\r\nBut that change is too remarkable an event to be discussed at the end of\r\nan article already more than sufficiently long. It is probable that we\r\nmay, at no remote time, resume the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, January, 1834.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThough {194}several years have elapsed since the publication of this\r\nwork, it is still, we believe, a new publication to most of our readers,\r\nis or are we surprised at this. The book is large, and the style heavy.\r\nThe information which Mr. Thackeray has obtained from the State Paper\r\nOffice is new; but much of it is very uninteresting. The rest of his\r\nnarrative is very little better than Gifford’s or Tomline’s Life of the\r\nsecond Pitt, and tells us little or nothing that may not be found quite\r\nas well told in the Parliamentary History, the Annual Register, and\r\nother works equally common.\r\n\r\nAlmost every mechanical employment, it is said, has a tendency to injure\r\nsome one or other of the bodily organs of the artisan. Grinders of\r\ncutlery die of consumption; weavers are stunted in then’ growth;\r\nsmiths become blear-eyed. In the same manner almost every intellectual\r\nemployment has a tendency to produce some intellectual malady.\r\nBiographers, translators, editors, all, in short, who employ themselves\r\nin illustrating\r\n\r\n     (1) _A History of the Right Honourable William Pitt, Earl of\r\n     Chatham, containing his Speeches in Parliament, a\r\n     considerable Portion of his Correspondence when Secretary of\r\n     State, upon French, Spanish, and American Affairs, never\r\n     before published; and an Account of the principal Events and\r\n     Persons of his Time, connected with his Life, Sentiments,\r\n     and Administration_. By the Rev. Francis Thackeray, A. M. 2\r\n     vols. 4to. London: 1827.\r\n\r\n{195}the lives or the writings of others, are peculiarly exposed to the\r\n_Lues Boswelliana_, or disease of admiration. But we scarcely remember\r\never to have seen a patient so far gone in this distemper as Mr.\r\nThackeray. He is not satisfied with forcing us to confess that Pitt was\r\na great orator, a vigorous minister, an honourable and high-spirited\r\ngentleman. He will have it that all virtues and all accomplishments met\r\nin his hero. In spite of Gods, men, and columns, Pitt must be a poet, a\r\npoet capable of producing a heroic poem of the first order; and we are\r\nassured that we ought to find many charms in such lines as these:\r\n\r\n                   “Midst all the tumults of the warring sphere,\r\n\r\n                   My light-charged bark may haply glide;\r\n\r\n                   Some gale may waft, some conscious thought shall cheer,\r\n\r\n                   And the small freight unanxious glide.” (1)\r\n\r\nPitt was in the army for a few months in time of peace. Mr. Thackeray\r\naccordingly insists on our confessing that, if the young cornet had\r\nremained in the service he would have been one of the ablest commanders\r\nthat ever lived. But this is not all. Pitt, it seems, was not merely\r\na great poet _in esse_, and a great general _in posse_, but a finished\r\nexample of moral excellence, the just man made perfect. He was in\r\nthe right when he attempted to establish an inquisition, and to give\r\nbounties for perjury, in order to get Walpole’s head. He was in the\r\nright when he declared Walpole to have been an excellent minister. He\r\nwas in the right when, being in opposition, he maintained that no peace\r\nought to be made with Spain, till she should formally renounce the right\r\nof search.\r\n\r\n     (1) The quotation is faithfully made from Mr. Thackeray.\r\n     Perhaps Pitt wrote guide in the fourth line.\r\n\r\n{196}He was in the right when, being in office, he silently acquiesced\r\nin a treaty by which Spain did not renounce the right of search. When\r\nhe left the Duke of Newcastle, when he coalesced with the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, when he thundered against subsidies, when he lavished\r\nsubsidies with unexampled profusion, when he execrated the Hanoverian\r\nconnection, when he declared that Hanover ought to be as dear to us as\r\nHampshire, he was still invariably speaking the language of a virtuous\r\nand enlightened statesman.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there scarcely ever lived a person who had so little\r\nclaim to this sort of praise as Pitt. He was undoubtedly a great man.\r\nBut his was not a complete and well-proportioned greatness. The public\r\nlife of Hampden or of Somers resembles a regular drama, which can be\r\ncriticised as a whole, and every scene of which is to be viewed in\r\nconnection with the main action. The public life of Pitt, on the\r\nother hand, is a rude though striking piece, a piece abounding in\r\nincongruities, a piece without any unity of plan, but redeemed by some\r\nnoble passages, the effect of which is increased by the tameness or\r\nextravagance of what precedes and of what follows. His opinions were\r\nun-fixed. His conduct at some of the most important conjunctures of his\r\nlife was evidently determined by pride and resentment. He had one fault,\r\nwhich of all human faults is most rarely found in company with true\r\ngreatness. He was extremely affected. He was an almost solitary instance\r\nof a man of real genius, and of a brave, lofty, and commanding spirit,\r\nwithout simplicity of character. He was an actor in the Closet, an actor\r\nat Council, an actor in Parliament; and even in private society he could\r\nnot lay aside his theatrical tones and attitudes. We know that one of\r\nthe most {197}distinguished of his partisans often complained that he\r\ncould never obtain admittance to Lord Chatham’s room till every thing\r\nwas ready for the representation, till the dresses and properties were\r\nall correctly disposed, till the light was thrown with Rembrandt-like\r\neffect on the head of the illustrious performer, till the flannels had\r\nbeen arranged with the air of a Grecian drapery, and the crutch placed\r\nas gracefully as that of Belisarius or Lear.\r\n\r\nYet, with all his faults and affectations, Pitt had, in a very\r\nextraordinary degree, many of the elements of greatness. He had genius,\r\nstrong passions, quick sensibility, and vehement enthusiasm for the\r\ngrand and the beautiful. There was something about him which ennobled\r\ntergiversation itself. He often went wrong, very wrong. But, to quote\r\nthe language of Wordsworth,\r\n\r\n                             “He still retained,\r\n\r\n               “‘Mid such abasement, what he had received\r\n\r\n               From nature, an intense and glowing mind.”\r\n\r\nIn an age of low and dirty prostitution, in the age of Dodington and\r\nSandys, it was something to have a man who might perhaps, under some\r\nstrong excitement, have been tempted to ruin his country, but who never\r\nwould have stooped to pilfer from her, a man whose errors arose, not\r\nfrom a sordid desire of gain, but from a fierce thirst for power, for\r\nglory, and for vengeance. History owes to him this attestation, that, at\r\na time when any thing short of direct embezzlement of the public\r\nmoney was considered as quite fair in public men, he showed the most\r\nscrupulous disinterestedness; that, at a time when it seemed to be\r\ngenerally taken for granted that Government could be upheld only by the\r\nbasest and most immoral arts, he appealed to the better {198}and nobler\r\nparts of human nature; that he made a brave and splendid attempt to do,\r\nby means of public opinion, what no other statesman of his day thought\r\nit possible to do, except by means of corruption; that he looked for\r\nsupport, not, like the Pelhams, to a strong aristocratical connection,\r\nnot like Bute, to the personal favour of the sovereign, but to the\r\nmiddle class of Englishmen; that he inspired that class with a firm\r\nconfidence in his integrity and ability; that, backed by them, he forced\r\nan unwilling court and an unwilling oligarchy to admit him to an ample\r\nshare of power; and that he used his power in such a manner as clearly\r\nproved him to have sought it, not for the sake of profit or patronage,\r\nbut from a wish to establish for himself a great and durable reputation\r\nby means of eminent services rendered to the state.\r\n\r\nThe family of Pitt was wealthy and respectable. His grandfather was\r\nGovernor of Madras, and brought back from India that celebrated diamond,\r\nwhich the Regent Orleans, by the advice of Saint Simon, purchased for\r\nupwards of two millions of livres, and which is still considered as\r\nthe most precious of the crown jewels of France. Governor Pitt bought\r\nestates and rotten boroughs, and sat in the House of Commons for Old\r\nSarum. His son Robert was at one time member for Old Sarum, and\r\nat another for Oakhampton. Robert had two sons. Thomas, the elder,\r\ninherited the estates and the parliamentary interest of his father. The\r\nsecond was the celebrated William Pitt.\r\n\r\nHe was born in November, 1708. About the early part of his life little\r\nmore is known than that he was educated at Eton, and that at seventeen\r\nhe was entered at Trinity College, Oxford. During the second year of his\r\nresidence at the University, George the {199}First died; and the event\r\nwas, after the fashion of that generation, celebrated by the Oxonians\r\nin many middling copies of verses. On this occasion Pitt published some\r\nLatin lines, which Mr. Thackeray has preserved. They prove that the\r\nyoung student had but a very limited knowledge even of the mechanical\r\npart of his art. All true Etonians will hear with concern that their\r\nillustrious schoolfellow is guilty of making the first syllable in\r\n_labenti_ short. (1) The matter of the poem is as worthless as that of\r\nany college exercise that was ever written before or since. There is,\r\nof course, much about Mars, Themis, Neptune, and Cocytus. The muses are\r\nearnestly entreated to weep over the urn of Cæsar; for Cæsar, says the\r\nPoet, loved the Muses; Cæsar, who could not read a line of Pope, and who\r\nloved nothing but punch and fat women.\r\n\r\nPitt had been, from his school-days, cruelly tormented by the gout, and\r\nwas advised to travel for his health. He accordingly left Oxford without\r\ntaking a degree, and visited France and Italy. He returned, however,\r\nwithout having received much benefit from his excursion, and\r\ncontinued, till the close of his life, to suffer most severely from his\r\nconstitutional malady.\r\n\r\nHis father was now dead, and had left very little to the younger\r\nchildren. It was necessary that William should choose a profession. He\r\ndecided for the army, and a cornet’s commission was procured for him in\r\nthe Blues.\r\n\r\nBut, small as his fortune was, his family had both the power and the\r\ninclination to serve him. At the general election of 1784, his elder\r\nbrother Thomas was\r\n\r\n     (1) So Mr. Thackeray has printed the poem. But it may be\r\n     charitably hoped that Pitt wrote labenti.\r\n\r\n{200}chosen both for Old Sarum and for Oakhampton. When Parliament met\r\nin 1735, Thomas made his election to serve for Oakhampton, and William\r\nwas returned for Old Sarum.\r\n\r\nWalpole had now been, during fourteen years, at the head of affairs. He\r\nhad risen to power under the most favorable circumstances. The whole of\r\nthe Whig party, of that party which professed peculiar attachment to\r\nthe principles of the Revolution, and which exclusively enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the reigning house, had been united in support of his\r\nadministration. Happily for him, he had been out of office when the\r\nSouth-Sea Act was passed; and though he does not appear to have foreseen\r\nall the consequences of that measure, he had strenuously opposed it,\r\nas he had opposed all the measures, good and bad, of Sunderland’s\r\nadministration. When the South-Sea Company were voting dividends of\r\nfifty per cent., when a hundred pounds of their stock were selling for\r\neleven hundred pounds, when Threadneedle Street was daily crowded with\r\nthe coaches of dukes and prelates, when divines and philosophers\r\nturned gamblers, when a thousand kindred bubbles were daily blown into\r\nexistence, the periwig-company, and the Spanish-jackass-company, and the\r\nquicksilver-fixation-company, Walpole’s calm good sense preserved him\r\nfrom the general infatuation. He condemned the prevailing madness in\r\npublic, and turned a considerable sum by taking advantage of it in\r\nprivate. When the crash came, when ten thousand families were reduced\r\nto beggary in a day, when the people, in the frenzy of their rage and\r\ndespair, clamoured, not only against the lower agents in the juggle,\r\nbut against the Hanoverian favourites, against the English ministers,\r\nagainst the King himself, when Parliament met, {201}eager for\r\nconfiscation and blood, when members of the House of Commons proposed\r\nthat the directors should be treated like parricides in ancient Rome,\r\ntied up in sacks, and thrown into the Thames, Walpole was the man on\r\nwhom all parties turned their eyes. Four years before he had been driven\r\nfrom power by the intrigues of Sunderland and Stanhope; and the lead in\r\nthe House of Commons had been intrusted to Craggs and Aislabie. Stanhope\r\nwas no more. Aislabie was expelled from Parliament on account of his\r\ndisgraceful conduct regarding the South-Sea scheme. Craggs was perhaps\r\nsaved by a timely death from a similar mark of infamy. A large minority\r\nin the House of Commons voted for a severe censure on Sunderland,\r\nwho, finding it impossible to withstand the force of the prevailing\r\nsentiment, retired from office, and outlived his retirement but a\r\nvery short time. The schism which had divided the Whig party was now\r\ncompletely healed. Walpole had no opposition to encounter except that of\r\nthe Tories; and the Tories were naturally regarded by the King with the\r\nstrongest suspicion and dislike.\r\n\r\nFor a time business went on with a smoothness and a despatch such as had\r\nnot been known since the days of the Tudors. During the session of 1724,\r\nfor example, there was hardly a single division except on private bills.\r\nIt is not impossible that, by taking the course which Pelham afterwards\r\ntook, by admitting into the government all the rising talents and\r\nambition of the Whig party, and by making room here and there for a Tory\r\nnot unfriendly to the House of Brunswick, Walpole might have averted\r\nthe tremendous conflict in which he passed the later years of his\r\nadministration, and in which he was at length vanquished. The Opposition\r\nwhich overthrew him was an Opposition {202}created by his own policy, by\r\nhis own insatiable love of power.\r\n\r\nIn the very act of forming his Ministry he turned one of the ablest and\r\nmost attached of his supporters into a deadly enemy. Pulteney had strong\r\npublic and private claims to a high situation in the new arrangement.\r\nHis fortune was immense. His private character was respectable. He was\r\nalready a distinguished speaker. He had acquired official experience\r\nin an important post. He had been, through all changes of fortune,\r\na consistent Whig. When the Whig party was split into two sections,\r\nPulteney had resigned a valuable place, and had followed the fortunes of\r\nWalpole. Yet, when Walpole returned to power, Pulteney was not invited\r\nto take office. An angry discussion took place between the friends.\r\nThe Ministry offered a peerage. It was impossible for Pulteney not to\r\ndiscern the motive of such an offer. He indignantly refused to accept\r\nit. For some time he continued to brood over his wrongs, and to watch\r\nfor an opportunity of revenge. As soon as a favourable conjuncture\r\narrived he joined the minority, and became the greatest leader of\r\nOpposition that the House of Commons had ever seen.\r\n\r\nOf all the members of the Cabinet, Carteret was the most eloquent and\r\naccomplished. His talents for debate were of the first order; his\r\nknowledge of foreign affairs was superior to that of any living\r\nstatesman; his attachment to the Protestant succession was undoubted.\r\nBut there was not room in one Government for him and Walpole. Carteret\r\nretired, and was, from that time forward, one of the most persevering\r\nand formidable enemies of his old colleague.\r\n\r\nIf there was any man with whom Walpole could {203}have consented to make\r\na partition of power, that man was Lord Townshend. They were distant\r\nkinsmen by birth, near kinsmen by marriage. They had been friends\r\nfrom childhood. They had been schoolfellows at Eton. They were country\r\nneighbors in Norfolk. They had been in office together under Godolphin.\r\nThey had gone into opposition together when Harley rose to power. They\r\nhad been persecuted by the same House of Commons. They had, after the\r\ndeath of Anne, been recalled together to office. They had again been\r\ndriven out together by Sunderland, and had again come back together\r\nwhen the influence of Sunderland had declined. Their opinions on public\r\naffairs almost always coincided. They were both men of frank, generous,\r\nand compassionate natures. Their intercourse had been for many years\r\naffectionate and cordial. But the ties of blood, of marriage, and of\r\nfriendship, the memory of mutual services, the memory of common triumphs\r\nand common disasters, were insufficient to restrain that ambition which\r\ndomineered over all the virtues and vices of Walpole. He was resolved,\r\nto use his own metaphor, that the firm of the house should be, not\r\nTownshend and Walpole, but Walpole and Townshend. At length the rivals\r\nproceeded to personal abuse before a large company, seized each other by\r\nthe collar, and grasped their swords. The women squalled. The men parted\r\nthe combatants. By friendly intervention the scandal of a duel\r\nbetween cousins, brothers-in-law, old friends, and old colleagues, was\r\nprevented. But the disputants could not long continue to act together.\r\nTownshend retired, and, with rare moderation and public spirit, refused\r\nto take any part in politics. He could not, he said, trust his temper.\r\nHe feared that the recollection of his private wrongs might impel him\r\n{204}to follow the example of Pulteney, and to oppose measures which he\r\nthought generally beneficial to the country. He therefore never visited\r\nLondon after his resignation, but passed the closing years of his life\r\nin dignity and repose among his trees and pictures at Rainham.\r\n\r\nNext went Chesterfield. He too was a Whig; and a friend of the\r\nProtestant succession. He was an orator, a courtier, a wit, and a man of\r\nletters. He was at the head of ton in days when, in order to be at the\r\nhead of ton, it was not sufficient to be dull and supercilious. It was\r\nevident that he submitted impatiently to the ascendency of Walpole. He\r\nmurmured against the Excise Bill. His brothers voted against it in the\r\nHouse of Commons. The Minister acted with characteristic caution and\r\ncharacteristic energy; caution in the conduct of public affairs; energy\r\nwhere his own supremacy was concerned. He withdrew his Bill, and turned\r\nout all his hostile or wavering colleagues. Chesterfield was stopped on\r\nthe great staircase of St. James’s and summoned to deliver up the staff\r\nwhich he bore as Lord Steward of the Household. A crowd of noble\r\nand powerful functionaries, the Dukes of Montrose and Bolton, Lord\r\nBurlington, Lord Stair, Lord Cobham, Lord Marchmont, Lord Clinton, were\r\nat the same time dismissed from the service of the Crown.\r\n\r\nNot long after these events the Opposition was reinforced by the Duke of\r\nArgyle, a man vainglorious indeed and fickle, but brave, eloquent, and\r\npopular. It was in a great measure owing to his exertions that the\r\nAct of Settlement had been peaceably carried into effect in England\r\nimmediately after the death of Anne, and that the Jacobite rebellion\r\nwhich, during the following year, broke out in Scotland, had been\r\nsuppressed. He too carried over to the minority the aid of his great\r\n{205}name, his talents, and his paramount influence in his native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases taken separately, a skilful defender of Walpole\r\nmight perhaps make out a case for him. But when we see that during a\r\nlong course of years all the footsteps are turned the same way, that\r\nall the most eminent of those public men who agreed with the Minister in\r\ntheir general views of policy left him, one after another, with sore\r\nand irritated minds, we find it impossible not to believe that the real\r\nexplanation of the phænomenon is to be found in the words of his son,\r\n“Sir Robert Walpole loved power so much that he would not endure a\r\nrival.” Hume has described this famous minister with great felicity in\r\none short sentence,--“moderate in exercising power, not equitable in\r\nengrossing it.” Kind-hearted, jovial, and placable as Walpole was, he\r\nwas yet a man with whom no person of high pretensions and high spirit\r\ncould long continue to act. He had, therefore, to stand against an\r\nOpposition containing all the most accomplished statesmen of the age,\r\nwith no better support than that which he received from persons like\r\nhis brother Horace or Henry Pelham, whose industrious mediocrity gave\r\nno cause for jealousy, or from clever adventurers, whose situation and\r\ncharacter diminished the dread which their talents might have inspired.\r\nTo this last class belonged Fox, who was too poor to live without\r\noffice; Sir William Yonge, of whom Walpole himself said, that nothing\r\nbut such parts could buoy up such a character, and that nothing but such\r\na character could drag down such parts; and Winnington, whose private\r\nmorals lay, justly or unjustly, under imputations of the worst kind.\r\n\r\nThe discontented Whigs were, not perhaps in number, {206}but certainly\r\nin ability, experience, and weight, by far the most important part of\r\nthe Opposition. The Tories furnished little more than rows of ponderous\r\nfox hunters, fat with Staffordshire or Devonshire ale, men who drank\r\nto the King over the water, and believed that all the fundholders were\r\nJews, men whose religion consisted in hating the Dissenters, and whose\r\npolitical researches had led them to fear, like Squire Western, that\r\ntheir land might be sent over to Hanover to be put in the sinking-fund.\r\nThe eloquence of these zealous squires, the remnant of the once\r\nformidable October Club, seldom went beyond a hearty Aye or No. Very few\r\nmembers of this party had distinguished themselves much in Parliament,\r\nor could, under any circumstances, have been called to fill any high\r\noffice; and those few had generally, like Sir William Wyndham, learned\r\nin the company of their new associates the doctrines of toleration and\r\npolitical liberty, and might indeed with strict propriety be called\r\nWhigs.\r\n\r\nIt was to the Whigs in Opposition, the Patriots, as they were called,\r\nthat the most distinguished of the English youth who at this season\r\nentered into public life attached themselves. These inexperienced\r\npoliticians felt all the enthusiasm which the name of liberty naturally\r\nexcites in young and ardent minds. They conceived that the theory of\r\nthe Tory Opposition and the practice of Walpole’s Government were alike\r\ninconsistent with the principles of liberty. They accordingly repaired\r\nto the standard which Pulteney had set up. While opposing the Whig\r\nminister, they professed a firm adherence to the purest doctrines of\r\nWhiggism. He was the schismatic; they were the true Catholics, the\r\npeculiar people, the depositaries {207}of the orthodox faith of Hampden\r\nand Russell, the one sect which, amidst the corruptions generated by\r\ntime and by the long possession of power, had preserved inviolate the\r\nprinciples of the Revolution. Of the young men who attached themselves\r\nto this portion of the Opposition the most distinguished were Lyttelton\r\nand Pitt.\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt entered Parliament, the whole political world was attentively\r\nwatching the progress of an event which soon added great strength to the\r\nOpposition, and particularly to that section of the Opposition in which\r\nthe young statesman enrolled himself. The Prince of Wales was gradually\r\nbecoming more and more estranged from his father and his father’s\r\nministers, and more and more friendly to the Patriots.\r\n\r\nNothing is more natural than that, in a monarchy where a constitutional\r\nOpposition exists, the heir-apparent of the throne should put himself\r\nat the head of that Opposition. He is impelled to such a course by every\r\nfeeling of ambition and of vanity. He cannot be more than second in the\r\nestimation of the party which is in. He is sure to be the first member\r\nof the party which is out. The highest favour which the existing\r\nadministration can expect from him is that he will not discard them.\r\nBut, if he joins the Opposition, all his associates expect that he will\r\npromote them; and the feelings which men entertain towards one from whom\r\nthey hope to obtain great advantages which they have not are far warmer\r\nthan the feelings with which they regard one who, at the very utmost,\r\ncan only leave them in possession of what they already have. An\r\nheir-apparent, therefore, who wishes to enjoy, in the highest\r\nperfection, all the pleasure that can be derived from eloquent flattery\r\nand profound respect, will always join those {208}who are struggling to\r\nforce themselves into power. This is, we believe, the true explanation\r\nof a fact which Lord Granville attributed to some natural peculiarity in\r\nthe illustrious House of Brunswick. “This family,” said he at Council,\r\nwe suppose after his daily halt-gallon of Burgundy, “always has\r\nquarrelled, and always will quarrel, from generation to generation.” He\r\nshould have known something of the matter; for he had been a favourite\r\nwith three successive generations of the royal house. We cannot quite\r\nadmit his explanation; but the fact is indisputable. Since the accession\r\nof George the First, there have been four Princes of Wales, and they\r\nhave all been almost constantly in Opposition.\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been the motives which induced Prince Frederic to\r\njoin the party opposed to the government, his support infused into\r\nmany members of that party a courage and an energy of which they stood\r\ngreatly in need. Hitherto it had been impossible for the discontented\r\nWhig! not to feel some misgivings when they found themselves dividing,\r\nnight after night, with uncompromising Jacobites who were known to be\r\nin constant communication with the exiled family, or with Tories who had\r\nimpeached Somers, who had murmured against Harley and St. John as too\r\nremiss in the cause of the Church and the landed interest, and who, if\r\nthey were not inclined to attack the reigning family, yet considered\r\nthe introduction of that family as, at best, only the less of two great\r\nevils, as a necessary but painful and humiliating preservative against\r\nPopery. The Minister might plausibly say that Pulteney and Carteret, in\r\nthe hope of gratifying their own appetite for office and for revenge,\r\ndid not scruple to serve the purposes of a faction hostile to the\r\nProtestant {209}succession. The appearance of Frederic at the head of\r\nthe patriots silenced this reproach. The leaders of the Opposition\r\nmight now boast that their course was sanctioned by a person as deeply\r\ninterested as the King himself in maintaining the Act of Settlement,\r\nand that, instead of serving the purposes of the Tory party, they had\r\nbrought that party over to the side of Whiggism. It must indeed be\r\nadmitted that, though both the King and the Prince behaved in a manner\r\nlittle to their honour, though the father acted harshly, the son\r\ndisrespectfully, and both ‘childishly, the royal family was rather\r\nstrengthened than weakened by the disagreement of its two most\r\ndistinguished members. A large class of politicians, who had considered\r\nthemselves as placed under sentence of perpetual exclusion from\r\noffice, and who, in their despair, had been almost ready to join in a\r\ncounter-revolution as the only mode of removing the proscription under\r\nwhich they lay, now saw with pleasure an easier and safer road to power\r\nopening before them, and thought it far better to wait till, in the\r\nnatural course of things, the Crown should descend to the heir of the\r\nHouse of Brunswick, than to risk their lands and their necks in a rising\r\nfor the House of Stuart. The situation of the royal family resembled the\r\nsituation of those Scotch families in which father and son took opposite\r\nsides during the rebellion, in order that, come what might, the estate\r\nmight not be forfeited.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1786, Frederic was married to the Princess of Saxe Gotha, with\r\nwhom he afterwards lived on terms very similar to those on which his\r\nfather had lived with Queen Caroline. The Prince adored his wife, and\r\nthought her in mind and person the most attractive of her sex. But he\r\nthought that conjugal fidelity {210}was an unprincely virtue; and, in\r\norder to be like Henry the Fourth, and the Regent Orleans, he affected\r\na libertinism for which he had no taste, and frequently quitted the only\r\nwoman whom he loved for ugly and disagreeable mistresses.\r\n\r\nThe address which the House of Commons presented to the King on the\r\noccasion of the Prince’s marriage was moved, not by the Minister, but by\r\nPulteney, the leader of the Whigs in Opposition. It was on this motion\r\nthat Pitt, who had not broken silence during the session in which he\r\ntook his seat, addressed the House for the first time. “A contemporary\r\nhistorian,” says Mr. Thackeray, “describes Mr. Pitt’s first speech as\r\nsuperior even to the models of ancient eloquence. According to Tindal,\r\nit was more ornamented than the speeches of Demosthenes, and less\r\ndiffuse than those of Cicero.” This unmeaning phrase has been a hundred\r\ntimes quoted. That it should ever have been quoted, except to be laughed\r\nat, is strange. The vogue which it has obtained may serve to show in how\r\nslovenly a way most people are content to think. Did Tindal, who first\r\nused it, or Archdeacon Coxe and Mr. Thackeray, who have borrowed it,\r\never in their lives hear any speaking which did not deserve the same\r\ncompliment? Did they ever hear speaking less ornamented than that of\r\nDemosthenes, or more diffuse than that of Cicero? We know no living\r\norator, from Lord Brougham down to Mr. Hunt, who is not entitled to the\r\nsame eulogy. It would be no very flattering compliment to a man’s figure\r\nto say, that he was taller than the Polish Count, and shorter than\r\nGiant O’Brien, fatter than the _Anatomie Vivante_, and more slender than\r\nDaniel Lambert. {211}Pitt’s speech, as it is reported in the Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine, certainly deserves Tindal’s compliment, and deserves no other.\r\nIt is just as empty and wordy as a maiden speech on such an occasion\r\nmight be expected to be. But the fluency and the personal advantages of\r\nthe young orator instantly caught the ear and eye of his audience. He\r\nwas, from the day of his first appearance, always heard with attention;\r\nand exercise soon developed the great powers which he possessed.\r\n\r\nIn our time, the audience of a member of Parliament is the nation.\r\nThe three or four hundred persons who may be present while a speech is\r\ndelivered may be pleased or disgusted by the voice and action of the\r\norator; but, in the reports which are read the next day by hundreds of\r\nthousands, the difference between the noblest and the meanest figure,\r\nbetween the richest and the shrillest tones, between the most graceful\r\nand the most uncouth gesture, altogether vanishes. A hundred years ago,\r\nscarcely any report of what passed within the walls of the House of\r\nCommons was suffered to get abroad. In those times, therefore, the\r\nimpression which a speaker might make on the persons who actually heard\r\nhim was every thing. His fame out of doors depended entirely on the\r\nreport of those who were within the doors. In the Parliaments of that\r\ntime, therefore, as in the ancient commonwealths, those qualifications\r\nwhich enhance the immediate effect of a speech, were far more important\r\ningredients in the composition of an orator than at present. All those\r\nqualifications Pitt possessed in the highest degree. On the stage, he\r\nwould have been the finest Brutus or Coriolanus ever seen. Those who\r\nsaw him in his decay, when his health was broken, when his {212}mind was\r\nuntuned, when he had been removed from that stormy assembly of which\r\nhe thoroughly knew the temper, and over which he possessed unbounded\r\ninfluence, to a small, a torpid, and an unfriendly audience, say that\r\nhis speaking was then, for the most part, a low, monotonous muttering,\r\naudible only to those who sat close to him, that when violently excited,\r\nhe sometimes raised his voice for a few minutes, but that it soon sank\r\nagain into an unintelligible murmur. Such was the Earl of Chatham;\r\nbut such was not William Pitt. His figure, when he first appeared in\r\nParliament, was strikingly graceful and commanding, his features high\r\nand noble, his eye full of fire. His voice, even when it sank to a\r\nwhisper, was heard to the remotest benches; and when he strained it to\r\nits full extent, the sound rose like the swell of the organ of a great\r\ncathedral, shook the house with its peal, and was heard through lobbies\r\nand down staircases, to the Court of Requests and the precincts of\r\nWestminster Hall. He cultivated all these eminent advantages with\r\nthe most assiduous care. His action is described by a very malignant\r\nobserver as equal to that of Garrick. His play of countenance was\r\nwonderful: he frequently disconcerted a hostile orator by a single\r\nglance of indignation or scorn. Every tone, from the impassioned cry\r\nto the thrilling aside, was perfectly at his command. It is by no means\r\nimprobable that the pains which he took to improve his great personal\r\nadvantages had, in some respects, a prejudicial operation, and tended\r\nto nourish in him that passion for theatrical effect which, as we have\r\nalready remarked, was one of the most conspicuous blemishes in his\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nBut it was not solely or principally to outward accomplishments that\r\nPitt owed the vast influence {213}which, during nearly thirty years, he\r\nexercised over the House of Commons. He was undoubtedly a great\r\norator; and, from the descriptions given by his contemporaines, and the\r\nfragments of his speeches which still remain, it is not difficult to\r\ndiscover the nature and extent of his oratorical powers.\r\n\r\nHe was no speaker of set speeches. His few prepared discourses were\r\ncomplete failures. The elaborate panegyric which he pronounced on\r\nGeneral Wolfe was considered as the very worst of all his performances.\r\n“No man,” says a critic who had often heard him, “ever knew so little\r\nwhat he was going to say.” Indeed his facility amounted to a vice.\r\nHe was not the master, but the slave of his own speech. So little\r\nselfcommand had he when once he felt the impulse, that he did not like\r\nto take part in a debate when his mind was full of an important secret\r\nof state. “I must sit still,” he once said to Lord Shelburne on such an\r\noccasion; “for, when once I am up, every thing that is in my mind comes\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nYet he was not a great debater. That he should not have been so when\r\nfirst he entered the House of Commons is not strange. Scarcely any\r\nperson has ever become so without long practice and many failures. It\r\nwas by slow degrees, as Burke said, that Charles Fox became the most\r\nbrilliant and powerful debater that ever lived. Charles Fox himself\r\nattributed his own success to the resolution which he formed when very\r\nyoung, of speaking, well or ill, at least once every night. “During five\r\nwhole sessions,” he used to say, “I spoke every night but one; and I\r\nregret only that I did not speak on that night too.” Indeed, with\r\nthe exception of Mr. Stanley, whose knowledge of the science of\r\nparliamentary defence resembles an {214}instinct, it would be difficult\r\nto name any eminent debater who had not made himself a master of his art\r\nat the expense of his audience.\r\n\r\nBut, as this art is one which even the ablest men have seldom acquired\r\nwithout long practice, so it is one which men of respectable abilities,\r\nwith assiduous and intrepid practice, seldom fail to acquire. It is\r\nsingular that, in such an art, Pitt, a man of great parts, of great\r\nfluency, of great boldness, a man whose whole life was passed in\r\nparlimentary conflict, a man who, during several years was the leading\r\nminister of the Crown in the House of Commons, should never have\r\nattained to high excellence. He spoke without premeditation; but his\r\nspeech followed the course of his own thoughts, and not the coux*se of\r\nthe previous discussion. He could, indeed, treasure up in his memory\r\nsome detached expression of an opponent, and make it the text for lively\r\nridicule or solemn reprehension. Some of the most celebrated bursts\r\nof his eloquence were called forth by an unguarded word, a laugh, or a\r\ncheer. But this was the only sort of reply in which he appears to have\r\nexcelled. He was perhaps the only great English orator who did not\r\nthink it any advantage to have the last word, and who generally spoke\r\nby choice before his most formidable antagonists. His merit was almost\r\nentirely rhetorical. He did not succeed either in exposition or in\r\nrefutation; but his speeches abounded in lively illustrations, striking\r\napophthegms, well told anecdotes, happy allusions, passionate appeals.\r\nHis invective and sarcasm were terrific. Perhaps no English orator was\r\never so much feared.\r\n\r\nBut that which gave most effect to his declamation was the air of\r\nsincerity, of vehement feeling, of moral {215}elevation, which belonged\r\nto all that he said. His style was not always in the purest taste.\r\nSeveral contemporary judges pronounced it too florid. Walpole, in the\r\nmidst of the rapturous eulogy which he pronounces on one of Pitt’s\r\ngreatest orations, owns that some of the metaphors were too forced. Some\r\nof Pitt’s quotations and classical stories are too trite for a clever\r\nschoolboy. But these were niceties for which the audience eared little.\r\nThe enthusiasm of the orator infected all who heard him; his ardour\r\nand his noble bearing put fire into the most frigid conceit, and gave\r\ndignity to the most puerile allusion.\r\n\r\nHis powers soon began to give annoyance to the Government; and Walpole\r\ndetermined to make an example of the patriotic cornet. Pitt was\r\naccordingly dismissed from the service. Mr. Thackeray says that the\r\nMinister took this step, because he plainly saw that it would have\r\nbeen vain to think of buying over so honourable and disinterested an\r\nopponent. We do not dispute Pitt’s integrity; but we do not know what\r\nproof he had given of it when he was turned out of the army; and we are\r\nsure that Walpole was not likely to give credit for inflexible honesty\r\nto a young adventurer, who had never had an opportunity of refusing\r\nany thing. The truth is, that it was not Walpole’s practice to buy off\r\nenemies. Mr. Burke truly says, in the Appeal to the Old Whigs, that\r\nWalpole gained very few over from the Opposition. Indeed that great\r\nminister knew his business far too well. He knew that, for one mouth\r\nwhich is stopped with a place, fifty other mouths will be instantly\r\nopened. He knew that it would have been very bad policy in him to\r\ngive the world to understand that more was to be got by thwarting his\r\nmeasures than by supporting them. {216}Those maxims are as old as the\r\norigin of parliamentary corruption in England. Pepys learned them, as he\r\ntells us, from the counsellors of Charles the Second.\r\n\r\nPitt was no loser. He was made Groom of the Bedchamber to the Prince\r\nof W ales, and continued to declaim against the ministers with unabated\r\nviolence and with increasing ability. The question of maritime right,\r\nthen agitated between Spain and England, called forth all his powers.\r\nHe clamoured for war with a vehemence which it is not easy to reconcile\r\nwith reason or humanity, but which appears to Mr. Thackeray worthy of\r\nthe highest admiration. We will not stop to argue a point on which we\r\nhad long thought that all well-informed people were agreed. We could\r\neasily show, we think, that if any respect be due to international law,\r\nif right, where societies of men are concerned, be any thing but another\r\nname for might, if we do not adopt the doctrine of the Buccaniers,\r\nwhich seems to be also the doctrine of Mr. Thackeray, that treaties\r\nmean nothing within thirty degrees of the line, the war with Spain was\r\naltogether unjustifiable. But the truth is, that the promoters of that\r\nwar have saved the historian the trouble of trying them. They have\r\npleaded guilty. “I have seen,” says Burke, “and with some care examined,\r\nthe original documents concerning certain important transactions of\r\nthose times. They perfectly satisfied me of the extreme injustice of\r\nthat war, and of the falsehood of the colours which Walpole, to his\r\nruin, and guided by a mistaken policy, suffered to be daubed over that\r\nmeasure. Some years after, it was my fortune to converse with many\r\nof the principal actors against that minister, and with those who\r\nprincipally excited that clamour. None of them, no not one, did in the\r\nleast defend the measure, or {217}attempt to justify their conduct. They\r\ncondemned it as freely as they would have done in commenting upon any\r\nproceeding in history in which they were totally unconcerned.” Pitt,\r\non subsequent occasions, gave ample proof that he was one of these\r\npenitents. But his conduct, even where it appeared most criminal to\r\nhimself, appears admirable to his biographer.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1741 were unfavourable to Walpole; and after a long\r\nand obstinate struggle he found it necessary to resign. The Duke of\r\nNewcastle and Lord Hardwicke opened a negotiation with the leading\r\npatriots, in the hope of forming an administration on a Whig basis. At\r\nthis conjuncture, Pitt and those persons who were most nearly connected\r\nwith him acted in a manner very little to their honour. They attempted\r\nto come to an understanding with Walpole, and offered, if he would\r\nuse his influence with the King in their favour, to screen him from\r\nprosecution. They even went so far as to engage for the concurrence of\r\nthe Prince of Wales. But Walpole knew that the assistance of the Boys,\r\nas he called the young Patriots, would avail him nothing if Pulteney and\r\nCarteret should prove intractable, and would be superfluous if the great\r\nleaders of the Opposition could be gained. He, therefore, declined the\r\nproposal. It is remarkable that Mr. Thackeray, who has thought it worth\r\nwhile to preserve Pitt’s bad college verses, has not even alluded to\r\nthis story, a story which is supported by strong testimony, and which\r\nmay be found in so common a book as Coxe’s Life of Walpole.\r\n\r\nThe new arrangements disappointed almost every member of the Opposition,\r\nand none more than Pitt. He was not invited to become a placeman; and\r\nhe {218}therefore stuck firmly to his old trade of patriot. Fortunate it\r\nwas for him that he did so. Had he taken office at this time, he would\r\nin all probability have shared largely in the unpopularity of Pulteney,\r\nSandys, and Carteret. He was now the fiercest and most implacable of\r\nthose who called for vengeance on Walpole. He spoke with great energy\r\nand ability in favour of the most unjust and violent propositions which\r\nthe enemies of the fallen minister could invent. He urged the House of\r\nCommons to appoint a secret tribunal for the purpose of investigating\r\nthe conduct of the late First Lord of the Treasury. This was done.\r\nThe great majority of the inquisitors were notoriously hostile to the\r\naccused statesman. Yet they were compelled to own that they could find\r\nno fault in him. They therefore called for new powers, for a bill of\r\nindemnity to witnesses, or, in plain words, for a bill to reward all\r\nwho might give evidence, true or false, against the Earl of Orford.\r\nThis bill Pitt supported, Pitt, who had himself offered to be a screen\r\nbetween Lord Orford and public justice. These are melancholy facts. Mr.\r\nThackeray omits them, or hurries over them as fast as he can; and, as\r\neulogy is his business, he is in the right to do so. But, though\r\nthere are many parts of the life of Pitt which it is more agreeable\r\nto contemplate, we know none more instructive. What must have been the\r\ngeneral state of political morality, when a young man, considered, and\r\njustly considered, as the most public-spirited and spotless statesman\r\nof his time, could attempt to force his way into office by means so\r\ndisgraceful!\r\n\r\nThe Bill of Indemnity was rejected by the Lords. Walpole withdrew\r\nhimself quietly from the public eye: and the ample space which he had\r\nleft vacant was soon {210}occupied by Carteret. Against Carteret Pitt\r\nbegan to thunder with as much zeal as he had ever manifested against\r\nSir Robert. To Carteret he transferred most of the hard names which\r\nwere familiar to his eloquence, sole minister, wicked minister, odious\r\nminister, execrable minister. The chief topic of Pitt’s invective was\r\nthe favour shown to the German dominions of the House of Brunswick. He\r\nattacked with great violence, and with an ability which raised him to\r\nthe very first rank among the parliamentary speakers, the practice of\r\npaying Hanoverian troops with English money. The House of Commons\r\nhad lately lost some of its most distinguished ornaments. Walpole and\r\nPulteney had accepted peerages; Sir William Wynd-ham was dead; and among\r\nthe rising men none could be considered as, on the whole, a match for\r\nPitt.\r\n\r\nDuring the recess of 1744, the old Duchess of Marlborough died. She\r\ncarried to her grave the reputation of being decidedly the best hater\r\nof her time. Yet her love had been infinitely more destructive than her\r\nhatred. More than thirty years before, her temper had ruined the party\r\nto which she belonged and the husband whom she adored. Time had made her\r\nneither wiser nor kinder. Whoever was at any moment great and prosperous\r\nwas the object of her fiercest detestation. She had hated Walpole; she\r\nnow hated Carteret. Pope, long before her death, predicted the fate of\r\nher vast property.\r\n\r\n               “To heirs unknown descends the unguarded store,\r\n\r\n               Or wanders, heaven-directed, to the poor.”\r\n\r\nPitt was then one of the poor; and to him Heaven directed a portion of\r\nthe wealth of the haughty Dowager. She left him a legacy of ten thousand\r\npounds, in consideration of “the noble defence he had made {220}for the\r\nsupport of the laws of England, and to prevent the ruin of his country.”\r\n\r\nThe will was made in August. The Duchess died in October. In November\r\nPitt was a courtier. The Pelhams had forced the King, much against his\r\nwill, to part with Lord Carteret, who had now become Earl Granville.\r\nThey proceeded, after this victory, to form the Government on that\r\nbasis, called by the cant name of “the broad bottom.” Lyttelton had a\r\nseat at the Treasury, and several other friends of Pitt were provided\r\nfor. But Pitt himself was, for the present, forced to be content with\r\npromises. The King resented most highly some expression which the ardent\r\norator had used in the debate on the Hanoverian troops. But Newcastle\r\nand Pelham expressed the strongest confidence that time and their\r\nexertions would soften the royal displeasure.\r\n\r\nPitt, on his part, omitted nothing that might facilitate his admission\r\nto office. He resigned his place in the household of Prince Frederic,\r\nand, when Parliament met, exerted his eloquence in support of the\r\nGovernment. The Pelhams were really sincere in their endeavours to\r\nremove the strong prejudices which had taken root in the King’s mind.\r\nThey knew that Pitt was not a man to be deceived with ease or offended\r\nwith impunity. They were afraid that they should not be long able to\r\nput him off with promises. Nor was it their interest so to put him off.\r\nThere was a strong tie between him and them. He was the enemy of their\r\nenemy. The brothers hated and dreaded the eloquent, aspiring, and\r\nimperious Granville. They had traced his intrigues in many quarters.\r\nThey knew his influence over the royal mind. They knew that, as soon as\r\na favourable opportunity should, arrive, {221}he would be recalled to\r\nthe head of affairs. They resolved to bring things to a crisis; and the\r\nquestion on which they took issue with their master was, whether Pitt\r\nshould or should not be admitted to office. They chose their time with\r\nmore skill than generosity. It was when rebellion was actually raging in\r\nBritain, when the Pretender was master of the northern extremity of the\r\nisland, that they tendered their resignations. The King found himself\r\ndeserted, in one day, by the whole strength of that party which\r\nhad placed his family on the throne. Lord Granville tried to form a\r\ngovernment; but it soon appeared that the parliamentary interest of the\r\nPelhams was irresistible, and that the King’s favourite statesman could\r\ncount only on about thirty Lords and eighty members of the House of\r\nCommons. The scheme was given up. Granville went away laughing. The\r\nministers came back stronger than ever; and the King was now no longer\r\nable to refuse any thing that they might be pleased to demand. He could\r\nonly mutter that it was very hard that Newcastle, who was not fit to ha\r\nchamberlain to the most insignificant prince in Germany, should dictate\r\nto the King of England.\r\n\r\nOne concession the ministers graciously made. They agreed that Pitt\r\nshould not be placed in a situation in which it would be necessary for\r\nhim to have frequent interviews with the King. Instead, therefore,\r\nof making their new ally Secretary-at-War as they had intended, they\r\nappointed him Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, and in a few months promoted\r\nhim to the office of Paymaster of the Forces.\r\n\r\nThis was, at that time, one of the most lucrative offices in the\r\nGovernment. The salary was but a small part of the emolument which the\r\nPaymaster derived {222}from his place. He was allowed to keep a large\r\nsum, which, even in time of peace, was seldom less than one hundred\r\nthousand pounds, constantly in his hands; and the interest on this sum\r\nhe might appropriate to his own use. This practice was not secret,\r\nnor was it considered as disreputable. It was the practice of men of\r\nundoubted honour, both before and after the time of Pitt. He, however,\r\nrefused to accept one farthing beyond the salary which the law had\r\nannexed to his office. It had been usual for foreign princes who\r\nreceived the pay of England to give to the Paymaster of the Forces\r\na small percentage on the subsidies. These ignominious vails Pitt\r\nresolutely declined.\r\n\r\nDisinterestedness of this kind was, in his days, very rare. His conduct\r\nsurprised and amused politicians. It excited the warmest admiration\r\nthroughout the body of the people. In spite of the inconsistencies of\r\nwhich Pitt had been guilty, in spite of the strange contrast between his\r\nviolence in Opposition and his tameness in office, he still possessed\r\na large share of the public confidence. The motives which may lead a\r\npolitician to change his connections or his general line of conduct are\r\noften obscure; but disinterestedness in pecuniary matters everybody can\r\nunderstand. Pitt was thenceforth considered as a man who was proof to\r\nall sordid temptations. If he acted ill, it might be from an error in\r\njudgment; it might be from resentment; it might be from ambition.\r\nBut poor as he was, he had vindicated himself from all suspicion of\r\ncovetousness.\r\n\r\nEight quiet years followed, eight years during which the minority, which\r\nhad been feeble ever since Lord Granville had been overthrown, continued\r\nto dwindle till it became almost invisible. Peace was made with France\r\nand Spain in 1748. Prince Frederic died in 1751; {223}and with him died\r\nthe very semblance of opposition. All the most distinguished survivors\r\nof the party which had supported Walpole and of the party which had\r\nopposed him were united under his successor. The fiery and vehement\r\nspirit of Pitt had for a time been laid to rest. He silently acquiesced\r\nin that very system of continental measures which he had lately\r\ncondemned. He ceased to talk disrespectfully about Hanover. He did not\r\nobject to the treaty with Spain, though that treaty left us exactly\r\nwhere we had been when he uttered his spirit-stirring harangues against\r\nthe pacific policy of Walpole. Now and then glimpses of his former self\r\nappeared; but they were few and transient. Pelham knew with whom he\r\nhad to deal, and felt that an ally, so little used to control, and so\r\ncapable of inflicting injury, might well be indulged in an occasional\r\nfit of waywardness.\r\n\r\nTwo men, little, if at all, inferior to Pitt in powers of mind, held,\r\nlike him, subordinate offices in the Government. One of these,\r\nMurray, was successively Solicitor-General and Attorney-General. This\r\ndistinguished person far surpassed Pitt in correctness of taste, in\r\npower of reasoning, in depth and variety of knowledge. His parliamentary\r\neloquence never blazed into sudden flashes of dazzling brilliancy;\r\nbut its clear, placid, and mellow splendour was never for an instant\r\noverclouded. Intellectually he was, we believe, fully equal to Pitt; but\r\nhe was deficient in the moral qualities to which Pitt owed most of his\r\nsuccess. Murray wanted the energy, the courage, the all-grasping and\r\nall-risking ambition, which make men great in stirring times. His heart\r\nwas a little cold, his temper cautious even to timidity, his manners\r\ndecorous even to formality. He never exposed his fortunes or his fame\r\nto any {224}risk which he could avoid. At one time he might, in all\r\nprobability, have been Prime Minister. But the object of his wishes\r\nwas the judicial bench. The situation of Chief Justice might not be so\r\nsplendid as that of First Lord of the Treasury; but it was dignified; it\r\nwas quiet; it was secure; and therefore it was the favourite situation\r\nof Murray.\r\n\r\nFox, the father of the great man whose mighty efforts in the cause\r\nof peace, of truth, and of liberty, have made that name immortal, was\r\nSecretary-at-War. He was a favourite with the King, with the Duke of\r\nCumberland, and with some of the most powerful members of the great Whig\r\nconnection. His parliamentary talents were of the highest order. As a\r\nspeaker he was in almost all respects the very opposite to Pitt.\r\nHis figure was ungraceful; his face, as Reynolds and Nollekens have\r\npreserved it to us, indicated a strong understanding; but the features\r\nwere coarse, and the general aspect dark and lowering. His manner was\r\nawkward; his delivery was hesitating; he was often at a stand for want\r\nof a word; but as a debater, as a master of that keen, weighty, manly\r\nlogic, v Inch is suited to the discussion of political questions, he\r\nhas perhaps never been surpassed except by his son. In reply he was as\r\ndecidedly superior to Pitt as in declamation he was Pitt’s inferior.\r\nIntellectually the balance was nearly even between the rivals. But here,\r\nagain, the moral qualities of Pitt turned the scale. Fox had undoubtedly\r\nmany virtues. In natural disposition as well as in talents, he bore a\r\ngreat resemblance to his more celebrated son. He had the same sweetness\r\nof ‘temper, the same strong passions, the same openness, boldness, and\r\nimpetuosity, the same cordiality towards friends, the same placability\r\ntowards enemies. No man {225}was more warmly or justly beloved by his\r\nfamily or by his associates. But unhappily he had been trained in a\r\nbad political school, in a school, the doctrines of which were, that\r\npolitical virtue is the mere coquetry of political prostitution, that\r\nevery patriot has his price, that Government can be carried on only by\r\nmeans of corruption, and that the state is given as a prey to statesmen.\r\nThese maxims were too much in vogue throughout the lower ranks of\r\nWalpole’s party, and were too much encouraged by Walpole himself, who,\r\nfrom contempt of what is in our day vulgarly called humbug, often ran\r\nextravagantly and offensively into the opposite extreme. The loose\r\npolitical morality of Fox presented a remarkable contrast to the\r\nostentatious purity of Pitt. The nation distrusted the former, and\r\nplaced implicit confidence in the latter. But almost all the statesmen\r\nof the age had still to learn that the confidence of the nation\r\nwas worth having. While things went on quietly, while there was no\r\nopposition, while every thing was given by the favour of a small ruling\r\njunto, Fox had a decided advantage over Pitt; but when dangerous times\r\ncame, when Europe was convulsed with war, when Parliament was broken up\r\ninto factions, when the public mind was violently excited, the\r\nfavourite of the people rose to supreme power, while his rival sank into\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1754 Henry Pelham died unexpectedly. “Now I shall have\r\nno more peace,” exclaimed the old King, when he heard the news. He was\r\nin the right. Pelham had succeeded in bringing together and keeping\r\ntogether all the talents of the kingdom. By his death, the highest post\r\nto which an English subject can aspire was left vacant; and at the same\r\nmoment, the influence which had yoked together and {226}reigned in so\r\nmany turbulent and ambitious spirits was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nWithin a week after Pelham’s death, it was determined that the Duke\r\nof Newcastle should be placed at the head of the treasury; but the\r\narrangement was still far from complete. Who was to be the leading\r\nMinister of the Crown in the House of Commons? Was the office to be\r\nintrusted to a man of eminent talents? And would not such a man in such\r\na place demand and obtain a larger share of power and patronage\r\nthan Newcastle would be disposed to concede? Was a mere drudge to be\r\nemployed? And what probability was there that a mere drudge would be\r\nable to manage a large and stormy assembly, abounding with able and\r\nexperienced men?\r\n\r\nPope has said of that wretched miser Sir John Cutler,\r\n\r\n                   “Cutler saw tenants break and houses fall\r\n\r\n                   For very want: he could not build a wall.”\r\n\r\nNewcastle’s love of power resembled Cutler’s love of money. It was an\r\navarice which thwarted itself, a penny-wise and pound-foolish cupidity.\r\nAn immediate outlay was so painful to him that he would not venture to\r\nmake the most desirable improvement. If he could have found it in his\r\nheart to cede at once a portion of his authority, he might probably have\r\nensured the continuance of what remained. But he thought it better to\r\nconstruct a weak and rotten government, which tottered at the smallest\r\nbreath, and lull in the first storm, than to pay the necessary price for\r\nsound and durable materials. He wished to find some person who would be\r\nwilling to accept the lead of the House of Commons on terms similar\r\nto those on which Secretary Craggs had acted under Sunderland,\r\n{227}five-and-thirty years before. Craggs could hardly be called a\r\nminister. He was a mere agent for the Minister. He was not trusted with\r\nthe higher secrets of state, but obeyed implicitly the directions of\r\nhis superior, and was, to use Doddington’s expression, merely Lord\r\nSunderland’s man. But times were changed. Since the days of Sunderland,\r\nthe importance of the House of Commons had been constantly on the\r\nincrease. During many years, the person who conducted the business of\r\nthe Government in that blouse had almost always been Prime Minister.\r\nIn these circumstances, it was not to be supposed that any person who\r\npossessed the talents necessary for the situation would stoop to accept\r\nit on such terms as Newcastle was disposed to offer.\r\n\r\nPitt was ill at Bath; and, had he been well and in London, neither the\r\nKing nor Newcastle would have been disposed to make any overtures to\r\nhim. The cool and wary Murray had set his heart on professional objects.\r\nNegotiations were opened with Fox. Newcastle behaved like himself, that\r\nis to say, childishly and basely. The proposition which he made was that\r\nFox should be Secretary of State, with the lead of the House of Commons;\r\nthat the disposal of the secret-service money, or, in plain words, the\r\nbusiness of buying members of Parliament, should be left to the First\r\nLord of the Treasury; but that Fox should be exactly informed of the way\r\nin which this fund was employed.\r\n\r\nTo these conditions Fox assented. But the next day every thing was in\r\nconfusion. Newcastle had changed his mind. The conversation which took\r\nplace between Fox and the Duke is one of the most curious in English\r\nhistory. “My brother,” said Newcastle, “when he was at the Treasury,\r\nnever told anybody {228}what he did with the secret-service money. No\r\nmore will I.” The answer was obvious. Pelham had been, not only First\r\nLord of the Treasury, but also manager of the House of Commons; and it\r\nwas therefore unnecessary for him to confide to any other person his\r\ndealings with the members of that House. “But how,”’ said Fox, “can I\r\nlead in the Commons without information on this head? How can I talk to\r\ngentlemen when I do not know which of them have received gratifications\r\nand which have not? And who,” he continued, “is to have the disposal of\r\nplaces?”--“I myself,” said the Duke.--“How then am I to manage the House\r\nof Commons?”--“Oh, let the members of the House of Commons come to me.”\r\n Fox then mentioned the general election which was approaching, and\r\nasked how the ministerial boroughs were to be filled up. “Do not trouble\r\nyourself,” said Newcastle; “that is all settled.” This was too much for\r\nhuman nature to bear. Fox refused to accept the Secretaryship of State\r\non such terms; and the Duke confided the management of the House of\r\nCommons to a dull, harmless man, whose name is almost forgotten in our\r\ntime, Sir Thomas Robinson.\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt returned from Bath he affected great moderation, though his\r\nhaughty soul was boiling with resentment. He did not complain of the\r\nmanner in which he had been passed by, but said openly that, in his\r\nopinion, Fox was the fittest man to lead the House of Commons. The\r\nrivals, reconciled by their common interest and their common enmities,\r\nconcerted a plan of operations for the next session. “Sir Thomas\r\nRobinson lead us!” said Pitt to Fox. “The Duke might as well send his\r\njack-boot to lead us.”\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1754 were favourable to the administration. {229}But\r\nthe aspect of foreign affairs was threatening. In India the English and\r\nthe French had been employed, ever since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,\r\nin cutting each other’s throats. They had lately taken to the same\r\npractice in America. It might have been foreseen that stirring times\r\nwere at hand, times which would call for abilities very different from\r\nthose of Newcastle and Robinson.\r\n\r\nIn November the Parliament met; and before the end of that month the new\r\nSecretary of State had been so unmercifully baited by the Paymaster of\r\nthe Forces and the Secretary at War that he was thoroughly sick of his\r\nsituation. Fox attacked him with great force and acrimony. Pitt affected\r\na kind of contemptuous tenderness for Sir Thomas, and directed his\r\nattacks principally against Newcastle. On one occasion he asked in tones\r\nof thunder whether Parliament sat only to register the edicts of one too\r\npowerful subject? The Duke was scared out of his wits. He was afraid\r\nto dismiss the mutineers; he was afraid to promote them; but it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to do something. Fox, as the less proud and\r\nintractable of the refractory pair, was preferred. A seat in the Cabinet\r\nwas offered to him on condition that he would give efficient support\r\nto the ministry in Parliament. In an evil hour for his fame and his\r\nfortunes he accepted the offer, and abandoned his connection with Pitt,\r\nwho never forgave this desertion.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, assisted by Fox, contrived to get through the business\r\nof the year without much trouble. Pitt was waiting his time. The\r\nnegotiations pending between France and England took every day a more\r\nunfavourable aspect. Towards the close of the session the King sent\r\na message to inform the House of Commons {230}that he had found it\r\nnecessary to make preparations for war. The House returned an address\r\nof thanks, and passed a vote of credit. During the recess, the old\r\nanimosity of both nations was inflamed by a series of disastrous events.\r\nAn English force was cut off in America; and several French merchantmen\r\nwere taken in the West Indian seas. It was plain that an appeal to arms\r\nwas at hand.\r\n\r\nThe first object of the King was to secure Hanover; and Newcastle was\r\ndisposed to gratify his master. Treaties were concluded, after the\r\nfashion of those times, with several petty German princes, who bound\r\nthemselves to find soldiers if England would find money; and, as it was\r\nsuspected that Frederic the Second had set his heart on the electoral\r\ndominions of his uncle, Russia was hired to keep Prussia in awe.\r\n\r\nWhen the stipulations of these treaties were made known, there arose\r\nthroughout the kingdom a murmur from which a judicious observer might\r\neasily prognosticate the approach of a tempest. Newcastle encountered\r\nstrong opposition, even from those whom he had always considered as\r\nhis tools. Legge, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, refused to sign the\r\nTreasury warrants which were necessary to give effect to the treaties.\r\nThose persons who were supposed to possess the confidence of the young\r\nPrince of Wales and of his mother held very menacing language. In this\r\nperplexity Newcastle sent for Pitt, hugged him, patted him, smirked at\r\nhim, wept over him, and lisped out the highest compliments and the most\r\nsplendid promises. The King, who had hitherto been as sulky as possible,\r\nwould be civil to him at the levee; he should be brought into the\r\nCabinet; he should be consulted about every thing; if he would only be\r\nas good as to support {231}the Hessian subsidy in the House of Commons.\r\nPitt coldly declined the proffered seat in the Cabinet, expressed the\r\nhighest love and reverence for the King, and said that, if his Majesty\r\nfelt a strong personal interest in the Hessian treaty he would so far\r\ndeviate from the line which he had traced out for himself as to\r\ngive that treaty his support. “Well, and the Russian subsidy,” said\r\nNewcastle. “No,” said Pitt, “not a system of subsidies.” The Duke\r\nsummoned Lord Hardwicke to his aid; but Pitt was inflexible. Murray\r\nwould do nothing. Robinson could do nothing. It was necessary to have\r\nrecourse to Fox. He became Secretary of State, with the full authority\r\nof a leader in the House of Commons; and Sir Thomas was pensioned off on\r\nthe Irish establishment.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1755, the Houses met. Public expectation was wound up\r\nto the height. After ten quiet years there was to be an Opposition\r\ncountenanced by the heir apparent of the throne, and headed by the\r\nmost brilliant orator of the age. The debate on the address was long\r\nremembered as one of the greatest parliamentary conflicts of that\r\ngeneration. It began at three in the afternoon, and lasted till five the\r\nnext morning. It was on this night that Gerard Hamilton delivered that\r\nsingle speech from which his nickname was derived. His eloquence threw\r\ninto the shade every orator except Pitt, who declaimed against the\r\nsubsidies for an hour and a half with extraordinary energy and effect.\r\nThose powers which had formerly spread terror through the majorities\r\nof Walpole and Carteret were now displayed in their highest perfection\r\nbefore an audience long unaccustomed to such exhibitions. One fragment\r\nof this celebrated oration remains in a state of tolerable preservation.\r\nIt is {232}the comparison between the coalition of Fox and Newcastle,\r\nand the junction of the Rhone and the Saone. “At Lyons,”’ said Pitt, “I\r\nwas taken to see the place where the two rivers meet, the one gentle,\r\nfeeble, languid, and, though languid, yet of no depth, the other a\r\nboisterous and impetuous torrent: but different as they are, they meet\r\nat last.” The amendment moved by the Opposition was rejected by a great\r\nmajority; and Pitt and Legge were immediately dismissed from their\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nDuring several months the contest in the House of Commons was extremely\r\nsharp. Warm debates took place on the estimates, debates still warmer on\r\nthe subsidiary treaties. The Government succeeded in every division;\r\nbut the fame of Pitt’s eloquence, and the influence of his lofty and\r\ndetermined character, continued to increase through the Session; and the\r\nevents which followed the prorogation made it utterly impossible for any\r\nother person to manage the Parliament or the country.\r\n\r\nThe war began in every part of the world with events disastrous\r\nto England, and even more shameful than disastrous. But the most\r\nhumiliating of these events was the loss of Minorca. The Duke of\r\nRichelieu, an old fop who had passed his life from sixteen to sixty in\r\nseducing women for whom he cared not one straw, landed on that island,\r\nand succeeded in reducing it. Admiral Byng was sent from Gibraltar to\r\nthrow succours into Port-Mahon; but he did not think fit to engage the\r\nFrench squadron, and sailed back without having effected his purpose.\r\nThe people were inflamed to madness. A storm broke forth, which appalled\r\neven those who remembered the days of Excise and of South-Sea. The shops\r\nwere filled {233}with libels and caricatures. The walls were covered\r\nwith placards. The city of London called for vengeance, and the cry was\r\nechoed from every corner of the kingdom. Dorsetshire, Huntingdonshire,\r\nBedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Somersetshire, Lancashire, Suffolk,\r\nShropshire, Surry, sent up strong addresses to the throne, and\r\ninstructed their representatives to vote for a strict inquiry into the\r\ncauses of the late disasters. In the great towns the feeling was as\r\nstrong as in the counties. In some of the instructions it was even\r\nrecommended that the supplies should be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe nation was in a state of angry and sullen despondency, almost\r\nunparalleled in history. People have, in all ages, been in the habit of\r\ntalking about the good old times of their ancestors, and the degeneracy\r\nof their contemporaries. This is in general merely a cant. But in 1756\r\nit was something more. At this time appeared Brown’s Estimate, a book\r\nnow remembered only by the allusions in Cowper’s Table Talk and in\r\nBurke’s Letters on a Regicide Peace. It was universally read, admired,\r\nand believed. The author fully convinced his readers that they were a\r\nrace of cowards and scoundrels; that nothing could save them; that they\r\nwere on the point of being enslaved by their enemies, and that they\r\nrichly deserved their fate. Such were the speculations to which ready\r\ncredence was given at the outset of the most glorious war in which\r\nEngland had ever been engaged.\r\n\r\nNewcastle now began to tremble for his place, and for the only thing\r\nwhich was dearer to him than his place, his neck. The people were not in\r\na mood to be trifled with. Their cry was for blood. For this once\r\nthey might be contented with the sacrifice of Byng. But what if fresh\r\ndisasters should take place? What {234}if an unfriendly sovereign should\r\nascend the throne? What if a hostile House of Commons should be chosen?\r\n\r\nAt length, in October, the decisive crisis came, the new Secretary of\r\nState had been long sick of the perfidy and levity of the First Lord\r\nof the Treasury, and began to fear that he might be made a scapegoat\r\nto save the old intriguer who, imbecile as he seemed, never wanted\r\ndexterity where danger was to be avoided. Fox threw up his office.\r\nNewcastle had recourse to Murray; but Murray had now within his reach\r\nthe favourite object of his ambition. The situation of Chief-Justice of\r\nthe King’s Bench was vacant; and the Attorney-General was fully resolved\r\nto obtain it, or to go into Opposition. Newcastle offered him any terms,\r\nthe Duchy of Lancaster for life, a tellership of the Exchequer, any\r\namount of pension, two thousand a year, six thousand a year. When the\r\nMinisters found that Murray’s mind was made up, they pressed for delay,\r\nthe delay of a session, a month, a week, a day. Would he only make his\r\nappearance once more in the House of Commons? Would he only speak in\r\nfavour of the address? He was inexorable, and peremptorily said that\r\nthey might give or withhold the Chief-Justiceship, but that he would be\r\nAttorney-General no longer.\r\n\r\nNewcastle now contrived to overcome the prejudices of the King, and\r\novertures were made to Pitt, through Lord Hardwicke. Pitt knew his\r\npower, and showed that he knew it. He demanded as an indispensable\r\ncondition that Newcastle should be altogether excluded from the new\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was in a state of ludicrous distress. He ran about chattering\r\nand crying, asking advice and listening to none. In the mean time, the\r\nSession drew near. The public excitement was unabated. Nobody {235}could\r\nbe found to face Pitt and Fox in the House of Commons. Newcastle’s heart\r\nfailed him, and he tendered his resignation.\r\n\r\nThe King; sent for Fox, and directed him to form the plan of an\r\nadministration in concert with Pitt. But Pitt had not forgotten old\r\ninjuries, and positively refused to act with Fox.\r\n\r\nThe King now applied to the Duke of Devonshire, and this mediator\r\nsucceeded in making an arrangement. He consented to take the Treasury.\r\nPitt became Secretary of State, with the lead of the House of Commons.\r\nThe Great Seal was put into commission. Legge returned to the Exchequer;\r\nand Lord Temple, whose sister Pitt had lately married, was placed at the\r\nhead of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nIt was clear from the first that this administration would last but a\r\nvery short time. It lasted not quite five months; and, during those five\r\nmonths, Pitt and Lord Temple were treated with rudeness by the King,\r\nand found but feeble support in the House of Commons. It is a remarkable\r\nfact, that the Opposition prevented the re-election of some of the\r\nnew Ministers. Pitt, who sat for one of the boroughs which were in the\r\nPelham interest, found some difficulty in obtaining a seat after his\r\nacceptance of the seals. So destitute was the new Government of that\r\nsort of influence without which no Government could then be durable. One\r\nof the arguments most frequently urged against the Reform Bill was that,\r\nunder a system of popular representation, men whose presence in the\r\nHouse of Commons was necessary to the conducting of public business\r\nmight often find it impossible to find seats. Should this inconvenience\r\never be felt, there cannot be the slightest difficulty in devising and\r\napplying a remedy. But those {236}who threatened us with this evil ought\r\nto have remembered that, under the old system, a great man called to\r\npower at a great crisis by the voice of the whole nation was in danger\r\nof being excluded, by an aristocratical cabal, from that House of which\r\nhe was the most distinguished ornament.\r\n\r\nThe most important event of this short administration was the trial\r\nof Byng. On that subject public opinion is still divided. We think\r\nthe punishment of the Admiral altogether unjust and absurd. Treachery,\r\ncowardice, ignorance amounting to what lawyers have called _crassa\r\nignorantia_, are fit objects of severe penal inflictions. But Byng was\r\nnot found guilty of treachery, of cowardice, or of gross ignorance of\r\nhis profession He died for doing what the most loyal subject, the most\r\nintrepid warrior, the most experienced seaman, might have done. He died\r\nfor an error in judgment, an error such as the greatest commanders,\r\nFrederic, Napoleon, Wellington, have often committed, and have often\r\nacknowledged. Such errors are not proper objects of punishment, for this\r\nreason, that the punishing of such errors tends not to prevent them,\r\nbut to produce them. The dread of an ignominious death may stimulate\r\nsluggishness to exertion, may keep a traitor to his standard, may\r\nprevent a coward from running away, but it has no tendency to bring out\r\nthose qualities which enable men to form prompt and judicious decisions\r\nin great emergencies. The best marksman may be expected to fail when\r\nthe apple which is to be his mark is set on his child’s head. We\r\ncannot conceive any thing more likely to deprive an officer of his\r\nself-possession at the time when he most needs it than the knowledge\r\nthat, if the judgment of his superiors should not agree with his, he\r\nwill be executed with {237}every circumstance of shame. Queens, it has\r\noften been said, run far greater risk in childbed than private women,\r\nmerely because their medical attendants are more anxious. The surgeon\r\nwho attended Marie Louise was altogether unnerved by his emotions.\r\n“Compose yourself,” said Bonaparte; “imagine that you are assisting a\r\npoor girl in the Faubourg Saint Antoine.” This was surely a far\r\nwiser course than that of the Eastern king in the Arabian Knights’\r\nEntertainments, who proclaimed that the physicians who failed to cure\r\nhis daughter should have their heads chopped off. Bonaparte knew mankind\r\nwell; and, as he acted towards this surgeon, he acted towards his\r\nofficers. No sovereign was ever so indulgent to mere errors of judgment;\r\nand it is certain that no sovereign ever had in his service so many\r\nmilitary men fit for the highest commands.\r\n\r\nPitt acted a brave and honest part on this occasion. He ventured to\r\nput both his power and his popularity to hazard, and spoke manfully for\r\nByng, both in Parliament and in the royal presence. But the King was\r\ninexorable. “The House of Commons, Sir,” said Pitt, “seems inclined to\r\nmercy.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” answered the King, “you have taught me to look for the sense of\r\nmy people in other places than the House of Commons.” The saying has\r\nmore point than most of those which are recorded of George the Second,\r\nand, though sarcastically meant, contains a high and just compliment to\r\nPitt.\r\n\r\nThe King disliked Pitt, but absolutely hated Temple. The new Secretary\r\nof State, his Majesty said, had never read Vatel, and was tedious and\r\npompous, but respectful. The First Lord of the Admiralty was grossly\r\nimpertinent. Walpole tells one story, which, {238}we fear, is much too\r\ngood to be true. He assures us that Temple entertained his royal master\r\nwith an elaborate parallel between Byng’s behaviour at Minorca, and his\r\nMajesty’s behaviour at Oudenarde, in which the advantage was all on the\r\nside of the Admiral.\r\n\r\nThis state of things could not last. Early in April, Pitt and all his\r\nfriends were turned out, and Newcastle was summoned to St. James’s. But\r\nthe public discontent was not extinguished. It had subsided when Pitt\r\nwas called to power. But it still glowed under the embers; and it now\r\nburst at once into a flame. The stocks fell. The Common Council met. The\r\nfreedom of the city was voted to Pitt. All the greatest corporate towns\r\nfollowed the example. “For some weeks,” says Walpole, “it rained gold\r\nboxes.”\r\n\r\nThis was the turning point of Pitt’s life. It might have been expected\r\nthat a man of so haughty and vehement a nature, treated so ungraciously\r\nby the Court, and supported so enthusiastically by the people, would\r\nhave eagerly taken the first opportunity of showing his power and\r\ngratifying his resentment; and an opportunity was not wanting. The\r\nmembers for many counties and large towns had been instructed to vote\r\nfor an inquiry into the circumstances which had produced the miscarriage\r\nof the preceding year. A motion for inquiry had been carried in the\r\nHouse of Commons, without opposition; and, a few days after Pitt’s\r\ndismissal, the investigation commenced. Newcastle and his colleagues\r\nobtained a vote of acquittal; but the minority were so strong that they\r\ncould not venture to ask for a vote of approbation, as they had at first\r\nintended; and it was thought by some shrewd observers that, if Pitt had\r\nexerted himself {239}to the utmost of his power, the inquiry might have\r\nended in a censure, if not in an impeachment.\r\n\r\nPitt showed on this occasion a moderation and selfgovernment which was\r\nnot habitual to him. He had found by experience, that he could not stand\r\nalone. His eloquence and his popularity had done much, very much for\r\nhim. Without rank, without fortune, without borough interest, hated\r\nby the King, hated by the aristocracy, he was a person of the first\r\nimportance in the state. He had been suffered to form a ministry, and to\r\npronounce sentence of exclusion on all his rivals, on the most powerful\r\nnobleman of the Whig party, on the ablest debater in the House of\r\nCommons. And he now found that he had gone too far. The English\r\nConstitution was not, indeed, without a popular element. But other\r\nelements generally predominated. The confidence and admiration of the\r\nnation might make a statesman formidable at the head of an Opposition,\r\nmight load him with framed and glazed parchments and gold boxes, might\r\npossibly, under very peculiar circumstances, such as those of the\r\npreceding year, raise him for a time to power. But, constituted as\r\nParliament then was, the favourite of the people could not depend on\r\na majority in the people’s own House. The Duke of Newcastle, however\r\ncontemptible in morals, manners, and understanding, was a dangerous\r\nenemy. His rank, his wealth, his unrivalled parliamentary interest,\r\nwould alone have made him important. But this was not all. The Whig\r\naristocracy regarded him as their leader. His long possession of power\r\nhad given him a kind of prescriptive right to possess it still. The\r\nHouse of Commons had been elected when he was at the head of affairs.\r\nThe members for the ministerial boroughs had all been {240}nominated by\r\nhim. The public offices swarmed with his creatures.\r\n\r\nPitt desired power; and he desired it, we really believe, from high and\r\ngenerous motives. He was, in the strict sense of the word, a patriot. He\r\nhad none of that philanthropy which the great French writers of his time\r\npreached to all the nations of Europe. He loved England as an Athenian\r\nloved the City of the Violet Crown, as a Roman loved the City of the\r\nSeven Hills. He saw his country insulted and defeated. He saw the\r\nnational spirit sinking. Yet he knew what the resources of the empire,\r\nvigorously employed, could effect; and he felt that he was the man to\r\nemploy them vigorously. “My Lord,” he said to the Duke of Devonshire,\r\n“I am sure that I can save this country, and that nobody else can.”\r\n\r\nDesiring, then, to be in power, and feeling that his abilities and the\r\npublic confidence were not alone sufficient to keep him in power against\r\nthe wishes of the Court and of the aristocracy, he began to think of a\r\ncoalition with Newcastle.\r\n\r\nNewcastle was equally disposed to a reconciliation. He, too, had\r\nprofited by his recent experience. He had found that the Court and\r\nthe aristocracy, though powerful, were not every thing in the state.\r\nA strong oligarchical connection, a great borough interest, ample\r\npatronage, and secret-service money, might, in quiet times, be all that\r\na Minister needed; but it was unsafe to trust wholly to such support\r\nin time of war, of discontent, and of agitation. The composition of the\r\nHouse of Commons was not wholly aristocratical; and, whatever be the\r\ncomposition of large deliberative assemblies, their spirit is always in\r\nsome degree popular. Where there are free debates, eloquence must have\r\n{241}admirers, and reason must make converts. Where there is a free\r\npress, the governors must live in constant awe of the opinions of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nThus these two men, so unlike in character, so lately mortal enemies,\r\nwere necessary to each other. Newcastle had fallen in November, for\r\nwant of that public confidence which Pitt possessed, and of that\r\nparliamentary support which Pitt was better qualified than any man of\r\nhis time to give. Pitt had fallen in April, for want of that species\r\nof influence which Newcastle had passed his whole life in acquiring and\r\nhoarding. Neither of them had power enough to support himself. Each\r\nof them had power enough to overturn the other. Their union would be\r\nirresistible. Neither the King nor any party in the state would be able\r\nto stand against them.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Pitt was not disposed to proceed to\r\nextremities against his predecessors in office. Something, however, was\r\ndue to consistency; and something was necessary for the preservation of\r\nhis popularity. He did little; but that little he did in such a manner\r\nas to produce great effect. He came down to the House in all the pomp of\r\ngout, his legs swathed in flannels, his arm dangling in a sling. He kept\r\nhis seat through several fatiguing days, in spite of pain and languor.\r\nHe uttered a few sharp and vehement sentences; but during the greater\r\npart of the discussion, his language was unusually gentle.\r\n\r\nWhen the inquiry had terminated without a vote either of approbation\r\nor of censure, the great obstacle to a coalition was removed. Many\r\nobstacles, however, remained. The King was still rejoicing in his\r\ndeliverance from the proud and aspiring Minister who had been forced on\r\nhim by the cry of the nation. His {242}Majesty’s indignation was excited\r\nto the highest point when it appeared that Newcastle, who had, during\r\nthirty years, been loaded with marks of royal favour, and who had\r\nbound himself, by a solemn promise, never to coalesce with Pitt, was\r\nmeditating a new perfidy. Of all the statesmen of that age, Fox had the\r\nlargest share of royal favour. A coalition between Fox and Newcastle was\r\nthe arrangement which the King wished to bring about. But the Duke was\r\ntoo cunning to fall into such a snare. As a speaker in Parliament, Fox\r\nmight perhaps be, on the whole, as useful to an administration as his\r\ngreat rival; but he was one of the most unpopular men in England. Then,\r\nagain, Newcastle felt all that jealousy of Fox, which, according to the\r\nproverb, generally exists between two of a trade. Fox would certainly\r\nintermeddle with that department which the Duke was most desirous to\r\nreserve entire to himself, the jobbing department. Pitt, on the other\r\nhand, was quite willing to leave the drudgery of corruption to any who\r\nmight be inclined to undertake it.\r\n\r\nDuring eleven weeks England remained without a ministry; and in the mean\r\ntime Parliament was sitting, and a war was raging. The prejudices of the\r\nKing, the haughtiness of Pitt, the jealousy, levity, and treachery of\r\nNewcastle, delayed the settlement. Pitt knew the Duke too well to trust\r\nhim without security. The Duke loved power too much to be inclined to\r\ngive security. While they were haggling, the King was in vain attempting\r\nto produce a final rupture between them, or to form a Government without\r\nthem. At one time he applied to Lord Waldgrave, an honest and sensible\r\nman, but unpractised in affairs. Lord Waldgrave had the courage to\r\naccept the Treasury, {243}but soon found that no administration formed\r\nby him had the smallest chance of standing a single week.\r\n\r\nAt length the King’s pertinacity yielded to the necessity of the case.\r\nAfter exclaiming with great bitterness, and with some justice, against\r\nthe Whigs, who ought, he said, to be ashamed to talk about liberty while\r\nthey submitted to the footmen of the Duke of Newcastle, his Majesty\r\nsubmitted. The influence of Leicester House prevailed on Pitt to abate\r\na little, and but a little, of his high demands; and all at once, out\r\nof the chaos in which parties had for some time been rising, falling,\r\nmeeting, separating, arose a government as strong at home as that of\r\nPelham, as successful abroad as that of Godolphin.\r\n\r\nNewcastle took the Treasury. Pitt was Secretary of State, with the lead\r\nin the House of Commons, and with the supreme direction of the war\r\nand of foreign affairs. Fox, the only man who could have given much\r\nannoyance to the new Government, was silenced with the office of\r\nPaymaster, which, during the continuance of that war, was probably\r\nthe most lucrative place in the whole Government. He was poor, and the\r\nsituation was tempting; yet it cannot but seem extraordinary that a man\r\nwho had played a first part in politics, and whose abilities had been\r\nfound not unequal to that part, who had sat in the Cabinet, who had led\r\nthe House of Commons, who had been twice intrusted by the King with the\r\noffice of forming a ministry, who was regarded as the rival of Pitt,\r\nand who at one time seemed likely to be a successful rival, should have\r\nconsented, for the sake of emolument, to take a subordinate place,\r\nand to give silent votes for all the measures of a government to the\r\ndeliberations of which he was not summoned. {244}The first acts of the\r\nnew administration were characterized rather by vigour than by judgment.\r\nExpeditions were sent against different parts of the French coast with\r\nlittle success. The small island of Aix was taken, Rochefort threatened,\r\na few ships burned in the harbour of St. Maloes, and a few guns and\r\nmortars brought home as trophies from the fortifications of Cherbourg.\r\nBut soon conquest of a very different kind filled the kingdom with pride\r\nand rejoicing. A succession of victories undoubtedly brilliant, and, as\r\nit was thought, not barren, raised to the highest point the fame of the\r\nminister to whom the conduct of the war had been intrusted. In July,\r\n1758, Louisburg fell. The whole island of Cape Breton was reduced.\r\nThe fleet to which the Court of Versailles had confided the defence\r\nof French America was destroyed. The captured standards were borne in\r\ntriumph from Kensington Palace to the city, and were suspended in St.\r\nPaul’s Church, amidst the roar of guns and kettle-drums, and the shouts\r\nof an immense multitude. Addresses of congratulation came in from all\r\nthe great towns of England. Parliament met only to decree thanks and\r\nmonuments, and to bestow, without one murmur, supplies more than double\r\nof those which had been given during the war of the Grand Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe year 1759 opened with the conquest of Gorec. Next fell Guadaloupe;\r\nthen Ticonderoga; then Niagara. The Toulon squadron was completely\r\ndefeated by Boscawen off Cape Inigos. But the greatest exploit of the\r\nyear was the achievement of Wolfe on the heights of Abraham. The news of\r\nhis glorious death and of the fall of Quebec reached London in the very\r\nweek in which the Houses met. All was joy and triumph. Envy and faction\r\nwere forced to join in the {245}general applause. Whigs and Tories\r\nvied with each other in extolling the genius and energy of Pitt. His\r\ncolleagues were never talked of or thought of. The House of Commons, the\r\nnation, the colonies, our allies, our enemies, had their eyes fixed on\r\nhim alone.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Parliament voted a monument to Wolfe when another great\r\nevent called for fresh rejoicings. The Brest fleet, under the command\r\nof Conflans, had put out to sea. It was overtaken by an English squadron\r\nunder Hawke. Conflans attempted to take shelter close under the French\r\ncoast. The shore was rocky: the night was black: the wind was furious:\r\nthe waves of the Bay of Biscay ran high. But Pitt had infused into every\r\nbranch of the service a spirit which had long been unknown. No British\r\nseaman was disposed to err on the same side with Byng. The pilot told\r\nHawke that the attack could not be made without the greatest danger.\r\n“You have done your duty in remonstrating,” answered Hawke; “I will\r\nanswer for every thing. I command you to lay me alongside the French\r\nadmiral.” Two French ships of the line struck. Four were destroyed. The\r\nrest hid themselves in the rivers of Britanny.\r\n\r\nThe year 1760 came; and still triumph followed triumph. Montreal was\r\ntaken; the whole province of Canada was subjugated; the French fleets\r\nunderwent a succession of disasters in the seas of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime conquests equalling in rapidity, and far surpassing in\r\nmagnitude, those of Cortes and Pizarro, had been achieved in the East.\r\nIn the space of three years the English had founded a mighty empire.\r\nThe French had been defeated in every part of India. Chandernagore had\r\nsurrendered to Clive, {246}Pondicherry to Coote. Throughout Bengal,\r\nBahar. Orissa and the Carnatic, the authority of the East India Company\r\nwas more absolute than that of Acbar or Aurungzebe had ever been.\r\n\r\nOn the continent of Europe the odds were against England. We had but one\r\nimportant ally, the King of Prussia; and he was attacked, not only by\r\nFrance, but also by Russia and Austria. Yet even on the Continent, the\r\nenergy of Pitt triumphed over all difficulties. Vehemently as he had\r\ncondemned the practice of subsidising foreign princes, he now carried\r\nthat practice farther than Carteret himself would have ventured to\r\ndo. The active and able Sovereign of Prussia received such pecuniary\r\nassistance as enabled him to maintain the conflict on equal terms\r\nagainst his powerful enemies. On no subject had Pitt ever spoken with\r\nso much eloquence and ardour as on the mischiefs of the Hanoverian\r\nconnection. He now declared, not without much show of reason, that\r\nit would be unworthy of the English people to suffer their King to be\r\ndeprived of his electoral dominions in an English quarrel. He assured\r\nhis countrymen that they should be no losers, and that he would conquer\r\nAmerica for them in Germany. By taking this line he conciliated the\r\nKing, and lost no part of his influence with the nation. In Parliament,\r\nsuch was the ascendency which his eloquence, his success, his high\r\nsituation, his pride, and his intrepidity had obtained for him, that he\r\ntook liberties with the House of which there had been no example, and\r\nwhich have never since been imitated. No orator could there venture to\r\nreproach him with inconsistency. One unfortunate man made the attempt,\r\nand was so much disconcerted by the scornful demeanour of the Minister\r\nthat he stammered, stopped, and {247}sat down. Even the old Tory country\r\ngentlemen, to whom the very name of Hanover had been odious, gave their\r\nhearty Ayes to subsidy after subsidy. In a lively contemporary satire,\r\nmuch more lively indeed than delicate, this remarkable conversion is not\r\nunhappily described.\r\n\r\n                        “No more they make a fiddle-faddle\r\n\r\n                        About a Hessian horse or saddle.\r\n\r\n                        No more of continental measures;\r\n\r\n                        No more of wasting British treasures.\r\n\r\n                        Ten millions, and a vote of credit,\r\n\r\n                        ’Tis right. He can’t be wrong who did it.”\r\n\r\nThe success of Pitt’s continental measures was such as might have been\r\nexpected from their vigour. When he came into power, Hanover was in\r\nimminent danger; and before he had been in office three months, the\r\nwhole electorate was in the hands of France. But the face of affairs was\r\nspeedily changed. The invaders were driven out. An army, partly English,\r\npartly Hanoverian, partly composed of soldiers furnished by the petty\r\nprinces of Germany, was placed under the command of Prince Ferdinand\r\nof Brunswick. The French were beaten in 1758 at Crevelt. In 1759 they\r\nreceived a still more complete and humiliating defeat at Minden.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the nation exhibited all the signs of wealth and\r\nprosperity. The merchants of London had never been more thriving. The\r\nimportance of several great commercial and manufacturing towns, of\r\nGlasgow in particular, dates from this period. The fine inscription on\r\nthe monument of Lord Chatham in Guildhall records the general opinion of\r\nthe citizens of London, that under his administration commerce had been\r\n“united with and made to flourish by war.” {248}It must be owned that\r\nthese signs of prosperity were in some degree delusive. It must be owned\r\nthat some of our conquests were rather splendid than useful. It must\r\nbe owned that the expense of the war never entered into Pitt’s\r\nconsideration. Perhaps it would be more correct to say that the cost of\r\nhis victories increased the pleasure with which he contemplated them.\r\nUnlike other men in his situation, he loved to exaggerate the sums\r\nwhich the nation was laying out under his direction. He was proud of the\r\nsacrifices and efforts which his eloquence and his success had induced\r\nhis countrymen to make. The price at which he purchased faithful service\r\nand complete victory, though far smaller than that which his son, the\r\nmost profuse and incapable of war ministers, paid for treachery, defeat,\r\nand shame, was long and severely felt by the nation.\r\n\r\nEven as a war minister, Pitt is scarcely entitled to all the praise\r\nwhich his contemporaries lavished on him. We, perhaps from ignorance,\r\ncannot discern in his arrangements any appearance of profound or\r\ndexterous combination. Several of his expeditions, particularly those\r\nwhich were sent to the coast of France, were at once costly and absurd.\r\nOur Indian conquests, though they add to the splendour of the period\r\nduring which he was at the head of affairs, were not planned by him. He\r\nhad undoubtedly great energy, great determination, great means at his\r\ncommand. His temper was enterprising; and, situated as he was, he had\r\nonly to follow his temper. The wealth of a rich nation, the valour of a\r\nbrave nation, were ready to support him in every attempt.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, however, he deserved all the praise that he has ever\r\nreceived. The success of our arms was perhaps owing less to the skill\r\nof his dispositions {240}than to the national resources and the national\r\nspirit. But that the national spirit rose to the emergency, that the\r\nnational resources were contributed with unexampled cheerfulness, this\r\nwas undoubtedly his work. The ardour of his soul had set the whole\r\nkingdom on fire. It inflamed every soldier who dragged the cannon up the\r\nheights of Quebec, and every sailor who boarded the French ships among\r\nthe rocks of Britanny. The Minister, before he had been long in office,\r\nhad imparted to the commanders whom he employed his own impetuous,\r\nadventurous, and defying character. They, like him, were disposed to\r\nrisk every thing, to play double or quits to the last, to think nothing\r\ndone while any thing remained undone, to fail rather than not to\r\nattempt. For the errors of rashness there might be indulgence. For\r\nover-caution, for faults like those of Lord George Sackville, there\r\nwas no mercy. In other times, and against other enemies, this mode of\r\nwarfare might have failed. But the state of the French government and of\r\nthe French nation gave every advantage to Pitt. The fops and intriguers\r\nof Versailles were appalled and bewildered by his vigour. A panic\r\nspread through all ranks of society. Our enemies soon considered it as\r\na settled thing that they were always to be beaten. Thus victory begot\r\nvictory; till, at last, wherever the forces of the two nations met, they\r\nmet with disdainful confidence on one side, and with a craven fear on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe situation which Pitt occupied at the close of the reign of George\r\nthe Second was the most enviable ever occupied by any public man in\r\nEnglish history. He had conciliated the King; he domineered over the\r\nHouse of Commons; he was adored by the people; he was admired by all\r\nEurope. He was the first Englishman {250}of his time: and he had made\r\nEngland the first country in the world. The Great Commoner, the name by\r\nwhich he was often designated, might look down with scorn on coronets\r\nand garters. The nation was drunk with joy and pride. The Parliament was\r\nas quiet as it had been under Pelham. The old party distinctions were\r\nalmost effaced; nor was their place yet supplied by distinctions of\r\na still more important kind. A new generation of country squires\r\nand rectors had arisen who knew not the Stuarts. The Dissenters were\r\ntolerated; the Catholics not cruelly persecuted. The Church was drowsy\r\nand indulgent. The great civil and religious conflict which began at\r\nthe Reformation seemed to have terminated in universal repose. Whigs\r\nand Tories, Churchmen and Puritans, spoke with equal reverence of the\r\nconstitution, and with equal enthusiasm of the talents, virtues, and\r\nservices of the Minister.\r\n\r\nA few years sufficed to change the whole aspect of affairs. A nation\r\nconvulsed by faction, a throne assailed by the fiercest invective, a\r\nHouse of Commons hated and despised by the nation, England set against\r\nScotland, Britain set against America, a rival legislature sitting\r\nbeyond the Atlantic, English blood shed by English bayonets, our armies\r\ncapitulating, our conquests wrested from us, our enemies hastening to\r\ntake vengeance for past humiliation, our flag scarcely able to maintain\r\nitself in our own seas, such was the spectacle which Pitt lived to see.\r\nBut the history of this great revolution requires far more space than we\r\ncan at present bestow. We leave the Great Commoner in the zenith of his\r\nglory. It is not impossible that we may take some other opportunity of\r\ntracing his life to its melancholly, yet not inglorious close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JAMES MACKINTOSH.

To\r\n     which is prefixed a Notice of the Life, Writings, and\r\n     Speeches of Sir James Mackintosh_. 4to. London: 1834.*\r\n\r\n     * In this review, as it originally stood, the editor of the\r\n     History of the Revolution was attacked with an asperity\r\n     which neither literary’ defects nor speculative differences\r\n     can justify, and which ought to be reserved for offences\r\n     against the laws of morality and honour The reviewer was not\r\n     actuated by any feeling of personal’ malevolence: for when\r\n     he wrote this paper in a distant country, he did not know,\r\n     or even guess, whom he was assailing. His only motive was\r\n     regard for the memory of an eminent man whom he loved and\r\n     honoured, and who appeared to him to have been unworthily\r\n     treated.\r\n\r\n     The editor is now dead; and, while living, declared that he\r\n     had been misunderstood, and that he had written in no spirit\r\n     of enmity to Sir James Mackintosh, for whom he professed the\r\n     highest respect.\r\n\r\n     Many passages have therefore been softened, and some wholly\r\n     omitted. The severe censure passed on the literary execution\r\n     of the Memoir and the Continuation could not be retracted\r\n     without a violation of truth. But whatever could be\r\n     construed into an imputation on the moral character of the\r\n     editor has been carefully expunged.\r\n\r\n{252}wisdom are in our ears. We will attempt to preserve strict\r\nimpartiality. But we are not ashamed to own that we approach this relic\r\nof a virtuous and most accomplished man with feelings of respect and\r\ngratitude which may possibly pervert our judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to avoid instituting a comparison between this\r\nwork and another celebrated Fragment. Our readers will easily guess that\r\nwe allude to Mr. Fox’s History of James the Second The two books relate\r\nto the same subject. Both were posthumously published. Neither had\r\nreceived the last corrections. The authors belonged to the same\r\npolitical party, and held the same opinions concerning the merits\r\nand defects of the English constitution, and concerning most of the\r\nprominent characters and events in English history. Both had\r\nthought much on the principles of government; yet they were not mere\r\nspeculators. Both had ransacked the archives of rival kingdoms, and\r\npored on folios which had mouldered for ages in deserted libraries; yet\r\nthey were not mere antiquaries. They had one eminent qualification for\r\nwriting history: they had spoken history, acted history, lived history.\r\nThe turns of political fortune, the ebb and flow of popular feeling, the\r\nhidden mechanism by which parties are moved, all these things were\r\nthe subjects of their constant thought and of their most familiar\r\nconversation. Gibbon has remarked that he owed part of his success as\r\na historian to the observations which he had made as an officer in the\r\nmilitia and as a member of the House of Commons. The remark is most\r\njust. We have not the smallest doubt that his campaign, though he never\r\nsaw an enemy, and his parliamentary attendance, though he never made a\r\nspeech, were of far {253}more use to him than years of retirement and\r\nstudy would have been. If the time that he spent on parade and at mess\r\nin Hampshire, or on the Treasury bench and at Brookes’s during the\r\nstorms which overthrew Lord North and Lord Shelburne, had been passed in\r\nthe Bodleian Library, he might have avoided some inaccuracies; he might\r\nhave enriched his notes with a greater number of references; but he\r\nwould never have produced so lively a picture of the court, the camp,\r\nand the senate-house. In this respect Mr. Fox and Sir James Mackintosh\r\nhad great advantages over almost every English historian who has written\r\nsince the time of Burnet. Lord Lyttelton had indeed the same advantages;\r\nbut he was incapable of using them. Pedantry was so deeply fixed in\r\nhis nature that the hustings, the Treasury, the Exchequer, the House of\r\nCommons, the House of Lords, left him the same dreaming schoolboy that\r\nthey found him.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the two interesting works of which we have been\r\nspeaking, we have little difficulty in giving the preference to that of\r\nSir James Mackintosh. Indeed the superiority of Mr. Fox to Sir Janies as\r\nan orator is hardly more clear than the superiority of Sir James to Mr.\r\nFox as an historian. Mr. Fox with a pen in his hand, and Sir James on\r\nhis legs in the House of Commons, were, we think, each out of his proper\r\nelement. They were men, it is true, of far too much judgment and ability\r\nto fail scandalously in any undertaking to which they brought the whole\r\npower of their minds. The history of James the Second will always keep\r\nits place in our libraries as a valuable book; and Sir James\r\nMackintosh succeeded in winning and maintaining a high place among the\r\nparliamentary speakers of his time. Yet we could {254}never read a page\r\nof Mr. Fox’s writing, we could never listen for a quarter of an hour\r\nto the speaking of Sir James, without feeling that there was a constant\r\neffort, a tug up hill. Nature, or habit which had become nature,\r\nasserted its rights. Mr. Fox wrote debates. Sir James Mackintosh spoke\r\nessays.\r\n\r\nAs far as mere diction was concerned, indeed, Mr. Fox did his best\r\nto avoid those faults which the habit of public speaking is likely\r\nto generate. He was so nervously apprehensive of sliding into some\r\ncolloquial incorrectness, of debasing his style by a mixture of\r\nparliamentary slang, that he ran into the opposite error, and purified\r\nhis vocabulary with a scrupulosity unknown to any purist. “Ciceronem\r\nAllobroga dixit.” He would not allow Addison, Bolingbroke, or Middleton\r\nto be a sufficient authority for an expression. He declared that he\r\nwould use no word which was not to be found in Dryden. In any other\r\nperson we should have called this solicitude mere foppery; and, in spite\r\nof all our admiration for Mr. Fox, we cannot but think that his extreme\r\nattention to the petty niceties of language was hardly worthy of so\r\nmanly and so capacious an understanding. There were purists of this\r\nkind at Home; and their fastidiousness was censured by Horace, with that\r\nperfect good sense and good taste which characterize all his writings.\r\nThere were purists of this kind at the time of the revival of letters;\r\nand the two greatest scholars of that time raised their voices, the one\r\nfrom within, the other from without the Alps, against a scrupulosity\r\nso unreasonable. “Carent,” said Politian, “quæ scribunt isti viribus\r\net vita, carent actu, carent effectu, carent indole....Nisi liber\r\nille præsto sit ex quo quid excerpant, colligere tria verba\r\nnon possunt....Horum semper igitur oratio Iremula, vacillans.\r\n{255}infirma....Quæso ne ista superstitione te alliges....Ut bene\r\ncurrere non potest qui pedem ponere studet in alienis tantum\r\nvestigiis, ita nec bene scribere qui tanquam de præscripto non audet\r\negredi.”--“Postliac,” exclaims Erasmus, “non licebit episcopos appellare\r\npatres reverendos, nec in calce literarum scribere annum a Christo nato,\r\nquod id nusquam facial Cicero. Quid autem ineptius quam, toto seculo\r\nnovato, religione, imperiis, magistratibus, locorum vocabulis,\r\nædificiis, cultu, monbus, non aliter andere loqui quam locutus est\r\nCicero? Si revivisceret ipse Cicero, rideret hoc Ciceronianorum genus.”\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Fox winnowed and sifted his phraseology with a care which\r\nseems hardly consistent with the simplicity and elevation of his mind,\r\nand of which the effect really was to debase and enfeeble his style,\r\nhe was little on his guard against those more serious improprieties of\r\nmanner into which a great orator who undertakes to write history is\r\nin danger of falling. There is about the whole book a vehement,\r\ncontentious, replying manner. Almost every argument is put in the form\r\nof an interrogation, an ejaculation, or a sarcasm. The writer seems\r\nto be addressing himself to some imaginary audience, to be tearing in\r\npieces a defence of the Stuarts which has just been pronounced by an\r\nimaginary Tory. Take, for example, his answer to Hume’s remarks on the\r\nexecution of Sydney; and substitute “the honourable gentleman” or\r\n“the noble Lord” for the name of Hume. The whole passage sounds like a\r\npowerful reply, thundered at three in the morning from the Opposition\r\nBench. While we read it, we can almost fancy that we see and hear the\r\ngreat English debater, such as he has been described to us by the few\r\nwho can still remember the Westminster scrutiny and the {256}Oczakow\r\nNegotiations, in the full paroxysm of inspiration, foaming, screaming,\r\nchoked by the rushing multitude of his words.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the passage to which we have referred, and several other\r\npassages which we could point out, are admirable when considered merely\r\nas exhibitions of mental power. We at once recognise in them that\r\nconsummate master of the whole art of intellectual gladiatorship, whose\r\nspeeches, imperfectly as they have been transmitted to us, should be\r\nstudied day and night by every man who wishes to learn the science of\r\nlogical defence. We find in several parts of the History of James the\r\nSecond fine specimens of that which we conceive to have been the great\r\ncharacteristic of Demosthenes among the Greeks, and of Fox among the\r\norators of England, reason penetrated, and, if we may venture on\r\nthe expression, made red-hot by passion. But this is not the kind of\r\nexcellence proper to history; and it is hardly too much to say that\r\nwhatever is strikingly good in Mr. Fox’s fragment is out of place.\r\n\r\nWith Sir James Mackintosh the case was reversed. His proper place\r\nwas his library, a circle of men of letters, or a chair of moral and\r\npolitical philosophy. He distinguished himself highly in Parliament. But\r\nnevertheless Parliament was not exactly the sphere for him. The effect\r\nof his most successful speeches was small when compared with the\r\nquantity of ability and learning which was expended on them. We could\r\neasily name men who, not possessing a tenth part of his intellectual\r\npowers, hardly ever address the House of Commons without producing a\r\ngreater impression than was produced by his most splendid and elaborate\r\norations. His luminous and philosophical disquisition on the Reform Bill\r\nwas spoken to empty benches. {257}Those, indeed, who had the wit to keep\r\ntheir seats, picked up hints which, skilfully used, made the fortune\r\nof more than one speech. But “it was caviare to the general.” And even\r\nthose who listened to Sir James with pleasure and admiration could not\r\nbut acknowledge that he rather lectured than debated. An artist who\r\nshould waste on a panorama, or a scene, or on a transparency, the\r\nexquisite finishing which we admire in some of the small Dutch\r\ninteriors, would not squander his powers more than this eminent man too\r\noften did. His audience resembled the boy in the Heart of Mid-Lothian,\r\nwho pushes away the lady’s guineas with contempt, and insists on\r\nhaving the white money. They preferred the silver with which they were\r\nfamiliar, and which they were constantly passing about from hand to\r\nhand, to the gold which they had never before seen, and with the value\r\nof which they were unacquainted.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted, we think, that Sir James Mackintosh did not\r\nwholly devote his later years to philosophy and literature. His talents\r\nwere not those which enable a speaker to produce with rapidity a series\r\nof striking but transitory impressions, and to excite the minds of five\r\nhundred gentlemen at midnight, without saying any thing that any one of\r\nthem will be able to remember in the morning. His arguments were of a\r\nvery different texture from those which are produced in Parliament at a\r\nmoment’s notice, which puzzle a plain man who, if he had them before him\r\nin writing, would soon detect their fallacy, and which the great debater\r\nwho employs them forgets within half an hour, and never thinks of again.\r\nWhatever was valuable in the compositions of Sir James Mackintosh was\r\nthe ripe fruit of study and of {258}meditation. It was the same with\r\nhis conversation. In his most familiar talk there was no wildness, no\r\ninconsistency, no amusing nonsense, no exaggeration for the sake of\r\nmomentary effect. His mind was a vast magazine, admirably arranged.\r\nEvery thing was there; and every thing was in its place. His judgments\r\non men, on sects, on books, had been often and carefully tested and\r\nweighed, and had then been committed, each to his proper receptacle,\r\nin the most capacious and accurately constructed memory that any human\r\nbeing ever possessed. It would have been strange indeed if you had asked\r\nfor any thing that was not to be found in that immense storehouse. The\r\narticle which you required was not only there. It was ready. It was in\r\nits own proper compartment.. In a moment it was brought down, unpacked,\r\nand displayed. If those who enjoyed the privilege--for a privilege\r\nindeed it was--of listening to Sir Janies Mackintosh, had been disposed\r\nto find some fault in his conversation, they might perhaps have observed\r\nthat he yielded too little to the impulse of the moment. He seemed to be\r\nrecollecting, not creating. He never appeared to catch a sudden glimpse\r\nof a subject in a new light. You never saw his opinions in the making,\r\nstill rude, still inconsistent, and requiring to be fashioned by thought\r\nand discussion. They came forth, like the pillars of that temple in\r\nwhich no sound of axes or hammers was heard, finished, rounded, and\r\nexactly suited to their places. What Mr. Charles Lamb has said with so\r\nmuch humour and some truth, of the conversation of Scotchmen in general,\r\nwas certainly true of this eminent Scotchman. He did not find, but\r\nbring. You could not cry halves to any thing that turned up while you\r\nwere in his company. {259}The intellectual and moral qualities which are\r\nmost important in a historian, he possessed in a very high degree. He\r\nwas singularly mild, calm, and impartial in his judgments of men, and\r\nof parties. Almost all the distinguished writers who have treated of\r\nEnglish history are advocates. Mr. Hallam and Sir James Mackintosh\r\nalone are entitled to be called judges. But the extreme austerity of Mr.\r\nHallam takes away something from the pleasure of reading his learned,\r\neloquent, and judicious writings. He is a judge, but a hanging judge,\r\nthe Page or Buller of the High Court of Literary Justice. His black cap\r\nis in constant requisition. In the long calendar of those whom he\r\nhas tried, there is hardly one who has not, in spite of evidence to\r\ncharacter and recommendations to mercy, been sentenced and left for\r\nexecution. Sir James, perhaps, erred a little on the other side. He\r\nliked a maiden assize, and came away with white gloves, after sitting in\r\njudgment on batches of the most notorious offenders. He had a quick eye\r\nfor the redeeming parts of a character, and a large toleration for the\r\ninfirmities of men exposed to strong temptations. But this lenity did\r\nnot arise from ignorance or neglect of moral distinctions. Though he\r\nallowed perhaps too much weight to every extenuating circumstance that\r\ncould be urged in favour of the transgressor, he never disputed the\r\nauthority of the law, or showed his ingenuity by refining away its\r\nenactments. On every occasion he showed himself firm where principles\r\nwere in question, but full of charity towards individuals.\r\n\r\nWe have no hesitation in pronouncing this Fragment decidedly the best\r\nhistory now extant of the reign of James the Second. It contains much\r\nnew and curious information, of which excellent use has {260}been made.\r\nBut we are not sure that the book is not in some degree open to the\r\ncharge which the idle citizen in the Spectator brought against his\r\npudding; “Mem. too many plums, and no suet.” There is perhaps too much\r\ndisquisition and too little narrative; and indeed this is the fault\r\ninto which, judging from the habits of Sir James’s mind, we should have\r\nthought him most likely to fall. What we assuredly did not anticipate\r\nwas, that the narrative would be better executed than the disquisitions.\r\nWe expected to find, and we have found, many just delineations of\r\ncharacter, and many digressions full of interest, such as the account of\r\nthe order of Jesuits, and of the state of prison discipline in England\r\na hundred and fifty years ago. We expected to find, and we have\r\nfound, many reflections breathing the spirit of a calm and benignant\r\nphilosophy. But we did not, we own, expect to find that Sir James could\r\ntell a story as well as Voltaire or Hume. Yet such is the fact; and\r\nif any person doubts it, we would advise him to read the account of\r\nthe events which followed the issuing of King James’s declaration,\r\nthe meeting of the clergy, the violent scene at the privy council, the\r\ncommitment, trial, and acquittal of the bishops. The most superficial\r\nreader must be charmed, we think, by the liveliness of the narrative.\r\nBut no person who is not acquainted with that vast mass of intractable\r\nmaterials of which the valuable and interesting part has been extracted\r\nand condensed can fully appreciate the skill of the writer. Here, and\r\nindeed throughout the book, we find many harsh and careless expressions\r\nwhich the author would probably have removed if he had lived to complete\r\nhis work. But, in spite of these blemishes, we must say that we should\r\nfind it difficult to point out, {261}in any modern history, any passage\r\nof equal length and at the same time of equal merit. We find in it\r\nthe diligence, the accuracy, and the judgment of Hallam, united to the\r\nvivacity and the colouring of Southey. A history of England, written\r\nthroughout in this manner, would be the most fascinating book in the\r\nlanguage. It would be more in request at the circulating libraries than\r\nthe last novel.\r\n\r\nSir James was not, we think, gifted with poetical imagination. But that\r\nlower kind of imagination which is necessary to the historian he had\r\nin large measure. It is not the business of the historian to create new\r\nworlds and to people them with new races of beings. He is to Homer\r\nand Shakspeare, to Dante and Milton, what Nollekens was to Canova, or\r\nLawrence to Michael Angelo. The object of the historian’s imitation\r\nis not within him; it is furnished from without. It is not a vision of\r\nbeauty and grandeur discernible only by the eye of his own mind, but a\r\nreal model which he did not make, and which he cannot alter. Yet his is\r\nnot a mere mechanical imitation. The triumph of his skill is to select\r\nsuch parts as may produce the effect of the whole, to bring out strongly\r\nall the characteristic features, and to throw the light and shade in\r\nsuch a manner as may heighten the effect. This skill, as far as we can\r\njudge, from the unfinished work now before us, Sir James Mackintosh\r\npossessed in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nThe style of this Fragment is weighty, manly, and unaffected. There are,\r\nas we have said, some expressions which seem to us harsh, and some which\r\nwe think inaccurate. These would probably have been corrected, if Sir\r\nJames had lived to superintend the publication. We ought to add that the\r\nprinter has by no {262}means done his duty. One misprint, in particular,\r\nis so serious as to require notice. Sir James Mackintosh has paid a high\r\nand just tribute to the genius, the integrity, and the courage of a\r\ngood and great man, a distinguished ornament of English literature,\r\na fearless champion of English liberty, Thomas Burnet, Master of the\r\nCharter-House, and author of that most eloquent and imaginative work,\r\nthe _Tellaris Theoria Sacra_. Wherever the name of this celebrated man\r\noccurs, it is printed “Bennet,” both in the text and in the index.\r\nThis cannot be mere negligence. It is plain that Thomas Burnet and his\r\nwritings were never heard of by the gentleman who has been employed\r\nto edite this volume, and who, not content with deforming Sir James\r\nMackintosh’s text by such blunders, has prefixed to it a bad Memoir, has\r\nappended to it a bad Continuation, and has thus succeeded in expanding\r\nthe volume into one of the thickest, and debasing it into one of the\r\nworst that we ever saw. Never did we fall in with so admirable an\r\nillustration of the old Greek proverb, which tells us that half is\r\nsometimes more than the whole. Never, did we see a case in which the\r\nincrease of the bulk was so evidently a diminution of the value.\r\n\r\nWhy such an artist was selected to deface so fine a Torso, we cannot\r\npretend to conjecture. We read that, when the Consul Mummius, after\r\nthe taking of Corinth, was preparing to send to Rome some works of the\r\ngreatest Grecian sculptors, he told the packers that if they broke his\r\nVenus or his Apollo, he would force them to restore the limbs which\r\nshould be wanting. A head by a hewer of mile-stones joined to a bosom by\r\nPraxiteles would not surprise or shock us more than this supplement.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir contains much that is worth reading; {263}for it contains\r\nmany extracts from the compositions of Sir James Mackintosh. But when we\r\npass from what the biographer has done with his scissors to what he has\r\ndone with his pen, we can find nothing to praise in his work. Whatever\r\nmay have been the intention with which he wrote, the tendency of his\r\nnarrative is to convey the impression that Sir James Mackintosh,\r\nfrom interested motives, abandoned the doctrines of the _Vindicice\r\nGrallicae_. Had such charges appeared in their natural place, we should\r\nleave them to their natural fate. We would not stoop to defend Sir\r\nJames Mackintosh from the attacks of fourth-rate magazines and pothouse\r\nnewspapers. But here his own fame is turned against him. A book of which\r\nnot one copy would ever have been bought but for his name in the title\r\npage is made the vehicle of the imputation. Under such circumstances\r\nwe cannot help exclaiming, in the words of one of the most amiable of\r\nHomer’s heroes,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0277]\r\n\r\nWe have no difficulty in admitting that, during the ten or twelve years\r\nwhich followed the appearance of the _Vindicio Gallicae_, the opinions\r\nof Sir James Mackintosh underwent some change. But did this chancre pass\r\non him alone? Was it not common? Was it not almost universal? Was there\r\none honest friend of liberty in Europe or in America whose ardour had\r\nnot been damped, whose faith in the high destinies of mankind had not\r\nbeen shaken? Was there one observer to whom the French Revolution, or\r\nrevolutions in general, appeared in exactly the same light on the day\r\nwhen the Bastile fell, and on the day when the Girondists were dragged\r\nto the scaffold, the day when the Directory {264}shipped off their\r\nprincipal opponents for Guiana, or the day when the Legislative Body\r\nwas driven from its hall at the point of the bayonet? We do not speak\r\nof light-minded and enthusiastic people, of wits like Sheridan, or\r\npoets like Alfieri; but of the most virtuous and intelligent practical\r\nstatesmen, and of the deepest, the calmest, the most impartial political\r\nspeculators of that time. What was the language and conduct of Lord\r\nSpencer, of Lord Fitzwilliam, of Mr. Grattan? What is the tone of M.\r\nDumont’s Memoirs, written just at the close of the eighteenth century?\r\nWhat Tory could have spoken with greater disgust and contempt of the\r\nFrench Revolution and its authors? Nay, this writer, a republican, and\r\nthe most upright and zealous of republicans, has gone so far as to say\r\nthat Mr. Burke’s work on the Revolution had saved Europe. The name of M.\r\nDumont naturally suggests that of Mr. Bentham. He, we presume, was not\r\nratting for a place; and what language did he hold at that time? Look at\r\nhis little treatise entitled _Sophismes Anarchiques_. In that treatise\r\nhe says, that the atrocities of the Revolution were the natural\r\nconsequences of the absurd principles on which it was commenced; that,\r\nwhile the chiefs of the constituent assembly gloried in the thought that\r\nthey were pulling down aristocracy, they never saw that their doctrines\r\ntended to produce an evil a hundred times more formidable, anarchy; that\r\nthe theory laid down in the Declaration of the Rights of Man had, in a\r\ngreat measure, produced the crimes of the Reign of ‘Terror; that none\r\nbut an eyewitness could imagine the horrors of a state of society in\r\nwhich comments on that Declaration were put forth by men with no food\r\nin their bellies, with rags on their backs, and pikes in their hands.\r\nHe praises the English Parliament for the dislike {265}which it has\r\nalways shown to abstract reasonings, and to the affirming of general\r\nprinciples. In M. Dumont’s preface to the Treatise on the Principles\r\nof Legislation, a preface written under the eye of Mr. Bentham, and\r\npublished with his sanction, are the following still more remarkable\r\nexpressions: “M. Bentham est bien loin d’attacher une. préférence\r\nexclusive à aucune forme de gouvernement. Il pense que la meilleure\r\nconstitution pour un peuple est celle à laquelle il est accoutumé....Le\r\nvice fondamental des théories sur les constitutions politiques, c’est de\r\ncommencer par attaquer celles qui existent, et d’exciter tout au moins\r\ndes inquiétudes et des jalousies de pouvoir. Une telle disposition n’est\r\npoint favorable au perfectionnement des lois. La seule époque où l’on\r\npuisse entreprendre avec succès des grandes réformes de législation, est\r\ncelle où les passions publiques sont calmes, et où le gouvernement jouit\r\nde la stabilité la plus grande. L’objet de M. Bentham, en cherchant\r\ndans le vice des lois la cause de la plupart des maux, a été constamment\r\nd’éloigner le pins grand de tous, le bouleversement de l’autorité, les\r\nrévolutions de propriété et de pouvoir.”\r\n\r\nTo so conservative a frame of mind had the excesses of the French\r\nRevolution brought the most illustrious reformers of that time. And\r\nwhy is one person to be singled out from among millions, and arraigned\r\nbefore posterity as a traitor to his opinions, only because events\r\nproduced on him the effect which they produced on a whole generation?\r\nPeople who, like Mr. Brothers in the last generation, and Mr. Percival\r\nin this, have been favoured with revelations from heaven, may be quite\r\nindependent of the vulgar sources of knowledge. But such poor creatures\r\nas Mackintosh, Dumont, and Bentham, {266}had nothing but observation and\r\nreason to guide them; and they obeyed the guidance of observation and of\r\nreason. How is it in physics? A traveller falls in with a berry which he\r\nhas never before seen. He tastes it, and finds it sweet and refreshing.\r\nHe praises it, and resolves to introduce it into his own country. But in\r\na few minutes he is taken violently sick; he is convulsed; he is at\r\nthe point of death. He of course changes his opinion, pronounces\r\nthis delicious food a poison, blames his own folly in tasting it, and\r\ncautions his friends against it. After a long and violent struggle he\r\nrecovers, and finds himself much exhausted by his sufferings, but free\r\nfrom some chronic complaints which had been the torment of his life.\r\nHe then changes his opinion again, and pronounces this fruit a very\r\npowerful remedy, which ought to be employed only in extreme cases and\r\nwith great caution, but which ought not to be absolutely excluded from\r\nthe Pharmacopoeia. And would it not be the height of absurdity to call\r\nsuch a man fickle and inconsistent, because he had repeatedly altered\r\nhis judgment? If he had not altered his judgment, would he have been a\r\nrational being? It was exactly the same with the French Revolution. That\r\nevent was a new phænomenon in politics. Nothing that had gone before\r\nenabled any person to judge with certainty of the course which affairs\r\nmight take. At first the effect was the reform of great abuses; and\r\nhonest men rejoiced. Then came commotion, proscription, confiscation,\r\nbankruptcy, the assignats, the maximum, civil war, foreign war,\r\nrevolutionary tribunals, guillotinades, noyades, fusillades. Yet a\r\nlittle while, and a military despotism rose out of the confusion, and\r\nmenaced the independence of every state in Europe. And yet again a\r\nlittle while, and {267}the old dynasty returned, followed by a train of\r\nemigrants eager to restore the old abuses. We have now, we think, the\r\nwhole before us. We should therefore be justly accused of levity or\r\ninsincerity if our language concerning those events were constantly\r\nchanging. It is our deliberate opinion that the French Revolution, in\r\nspite of all its crimes and follies, was a great blessing to mankind.\r\nBut it was not only natural, but inevitable, that those who had only\r\nseen the first act should be ignorant of the catastrophe, and should be\r\nalternately elated and depressed as the plot went on disclosing\r\nitself to them. A man who had held exactly the same opinion about the\r\nRevolution in 1789, in 1794, in 1804, in 1814, and in 1884, would\r\nhave been either a divinely inspired prophet, or an obstinate fool.\r\nMackintosh was neither. He was simply a wise and good man; and the\r\nchange which passed on his mind was a change which passed on the mind\r\nof almost every wise and good man in Europe. In fact, few of his\r\ncontemporaries changed so little. The rare moderation and calmness\r\nof his temper preserved him alike from extravagant elation and from\r\nextravagant despondency. He was never a Jacobin. He was never an\r\nAntijacobin. His mind oscillated undoubtedly; but the extreme points of\r\nthe oscillation were not very remote. Herein he differed greatly from\r\nsome persons of distinguished talents who entered into life at nearly\r\nthe same time with him. Such persons we have seen rushing from one wild\r\nextreme to another, out-Paining Paine, out-Castlereaghing Castlereagh,\r\nPantisocratists, Ultra-Tories, heretics, persecutors, breaking the\r\nold laws against sedition, calling for new and sharper laws against\r\nsedition, writing democratic dramas, writing Laureate odes, panegyrising\r\n{268}Marten, panegyrising Land, consistent in nothing but an intolerance\r\nwhich in any person would be censurable, but which is altogether\r\nunpardonable in men who, by their own confession, have had such ample\r\nexperience of their own fallibility. We readily concede to some of these\r\npersons the praise of eloquence and poetical invention; nor are we\r\nby any means disposed, even where they have been gainers by their\r\nconversion, to question their sincerity. It would be most uncandid to\r\nattribute to sordid motives actions which admit of a less discreditable\r\nexplanation. We think that the conduct of these persons has been\r\nprecisely what was to be expected from men who were gifted with strong\r\nimagination and quick sensibility, but who were neither accurate\r\nobservers nor logical reasoners. It was natural that such men should see\r\nin the victory of the third estate of France the dawn of a new Saturnian\r\nage. It was natural that the rage of their disappointment should be\r\nproportioned to the extravagance of their hopes. Though the direction of\r\ntheir passions was altered, the violence of those passions was the same.\r\nThe force of the rebound was proportioned to the force of the original\r\nimpulse. The pendulum swung furiously to the left, because it had been\r\ndrawn too far to the right.\r\n\r\nWe own that nothing gives us so high an idea of the judgment and temper\r\nof Sir James Mackintosh as the manner in which he shaped his course\r\nthrough those times. Exposed successively to two opposite infections, he\r\ntook both in their very mildest form. Hie constitution of his mind was\r\nsuch that neither of the diseases which wrought such havoc all round him\r\ncould in any serious degree, or for any great length of time, derange\r\nhis intellectual health. He, {269}like every honest and enlightened man\r\nin Europe, saw with delight the great awakening; of the French nation.\r\nYet he never, in the season of his wannest enthusiasm, proclaimed\r\ndoctrines inconsistent with the safety of property and the just\r\nauthority of governments. He, like almost every other honest and\r\nenlightened man, was discouraged and perplexed by the terrible events\r\nwhich followed. Yet he never in the most gloomy times abandoned the\r\ncause of peace, of liberty, and of toleration. In that great convulsion\r\nwhich overset almost every other understanding, he was indeed so much\r\nshaken that he leaned sometimes in one direction and sometimes in the\r\nother; but he never lost his balance. The opinions in which he at last\r\nreposed, and to which, in spite of strong temptations, he adhered with\r\na firm, a disinterested, an ill-requited fidelity, were a just mean\r\nbetween those which he had defended with youthful ardour and with more\r\nthan manly prowess against Mr. Burke, and those to which he had inclined\r\nduring the darkest and saddest years in the history of modern Europe.\r\nWe are much mistaken if this be the picture either of a weak or of a\r\ndishonest mind.\r\n\r\nWhat the political opinions of Sir James Mackintosh were in his later\r\nyears is written in the annals of his country. Those annals will\r\nsufficiently refute what the Editor has ventured to assert in the\r\nvery advertisement to this work. “Sir James Mackintosh,” says he,\r\n“was avowedly and emphatically a Whig of the Revolution: and since\r\nthe agitation of religious liberty and parliamentary reform became\r\na national movement, the great transaction of 1688 has been more\r\ndispassionately, more correctly, and less highly estimated.” If these\r\nwords mean any thing, they must {270}mean that the opinions of Sir James\r\nMackintosh concerning religious liberty and parliamentary reform went\r\nno further than those of the authors of the Revolution; in other words,\r\nthat Sir James Mackintosh opposed Catholic Emancipation, and approved of\r\nthe old constitution of the House of Commons. The allocation is confuted\r\nby twenty volumes of Parliamentary Debates, nay by innumerable passages\r\nin the very Fragment which this writer has defaced. We will venture to\r\nsay that Sir James Mackintosh often did more for religions liberty and\r\nfor parliamentary reform in a quarter of an hour, than most of those\r\nzealots who are in the habit of depreciating him, have done or will do\r\nin the whole course of their lives.\r\n\r\nNothing in the Memoir, or in the Continuation of the History, has struck\r\nus so much as the contempt with which the writer thinks fit to speak of\r\nall things that were done before the coming in of the very last fashions\r\nin politics. We think that we have sometimes observed a leaning towards\r\nthe same fault in writers of a much higher order of intellect. We will\r\ntherefore take this opportunity of making a few remarks on an error\r\nwhich is, we fear, becoming common, and which appears to us not\r\nonly absurd, but as pernicious as almost any error concerning the\r\ntransactions of a past age can possibly be.\r\n\r\nWe shall not, we hope, be suspected of a bigoted attachment to the\r\ndoctrines and practices of past generations. Our creed is that the\r\nscience of government is an experimental science, and that, like all\r\nother experimental sciences, it is generally in a state of progression.\r\nNo man is so obstinate an admirer of the old times as to deny that\r\nmedicine, surgery, botany, chemistry, engineering, navigation, are\r\nbetter understood {271}now than in any former age. We conceive that it\r\nis the same with political science. Like those physical sciences\r\nwhich we have mentioned, it has always been working itself clearer and\r\nclearer, and depositing impurity after impurity. There was a time when\r\nthe most powerful of human intellects were deluded by the gibberish of\r\nthe astrologer and the alchemist; and just so there was a time when the\r\nmost enlightened and virtuous statesmen thought it the first duty of a\r\ngovernment to persecute heretics, to found monasteries, to make war\r\non Saracens. But time advances; facts accumulate; doubts arise. Faint\r\nglimpses of truth begin to appear, and shine more and more unto the\r\nperfect day. The highest intellects, like the tops of mountains, are the\r\nfirst to catch and to reflect the dawn. They are bright, while the\r\nlevel below is still in darkness. But soon the light, which at first\r\nilluminated only the loftiest eminences, descends on the plain and\r\npenetrates to the deepest valley. First come hints, then fragments of\r\nsystems, then defective systems, then complete and harmonious systems.\r\nThe sound opinion, held for a time by one bold speculator, becomes the\r\nopinion of a small minority, of a strong minority, of a majority of\r\nmankind. Thus, the great progress goes on, till schoolboys laugh at\r\nthe jargon which imposed on Bacon, till country rectors condemn the\r\nilliberality and intolerance of Sir Thomas More.\r\n\r\nSeeing these things, seeing that, by the confession of the most\r\nobstinate enemies of innovation, our race has hitherto been almost\r\nconstantly advancing in knowledge, and not seeing any reason to believe\r\nthat, precisely at the point of time at which we came into the world, a\r\nchange took place in the faculties of the human mind, or in the mode\r\nof discovering truth, we {272}are reformers: we are on the side of\r\nprogress. From the great advances which European society lias made,\r\nduring the last four centuries, in every species of knowledge, we infer,\r\nnot that there is no more room for improvement, but that, in every\r\nscience which deserves the name, immense improvements may be confidently\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nBut the very considerations which lead us to look for ward with sanguine\r\nhope to the future prevent us from looking back with contempt on the\r\npast. We do not flatter ourselves with the notion that we have attained\r\nperfection, and that no more truth remains to be found. We believe that\r\nwe are wiser than our ancestors. We believe, also, that our posterity\r\nwill be wiser than we. It would be gross injustice in our grandchildren\r\nto talk of us with contempt, merely because they may have surpassed us;\r\nto call Watt a fool, because mechanical powers may be discovered which\r\nmay supersede the use of steam; to deride the efforts which have been\r\nmade in our time to improve the discipline of prisons, and to enlighten\r\nthe minds of the poor, because future philanthropists may devise better\r\nplaces of confinement than Air. Bentham’s Panopticon, and better\r\nplaces of education than Air. Lancaster’s Schools. As we would have our\r\ndescendants judge us, so ought we to judge our fathers. In order to form\r\na correct estimate of their merits, we ought to place ourselves in their\r\nsituation, to put out of our minds, for a time, all that knowledge which\r\nthey, however eager in the pursuit of truth, could not have, and which\r\nwe, however negligent we may have been, could not help having. It\r\nwas not merely difficult, but absolutely impossible, for the best and\r\ngreatest of men, two hundred years ago, to be what a very commonplace\r\nperson {273}in our days may easily be, and indeed must necessarily be.\r\nBut it is too much that the benefactors of mankind, after having been\r\nreviled by the dunces of their own generation for going too far, should\r\nbe reviled by the dunces of the next generation for not going far\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe truth lies between two absurd extremes. On one side is the bigot who\r\npleads the wisdom of our ancestors as a reason for not doing what they\r\nin our place would be the first to do; who opposes the Reform Bill\r\nbecause Lord Somers did not see the necessity of Parliamentary Reform;\r\nwho would have opposed the Revolution because Ridley and Cranmer\r\nprofessed boundless submission to the royal prerogative; and who would\r\nhave opposed the Reformation because the Fitzwalters and Mareschals,\r\nwhose seals are set to the Great Charter, were devoted adherents to the\r\nChurch of Rome. On the other side is the sciolist who speaks with scorn\r\nof the Great Charter, because it did not reform the Church; of the\r\nReformation, because it did not limit the prerogative; and of the\r\nRevolution, because it did not purify the House of Commons. The former\r\nof these errors we have often combated, and shall always be ready to\r\ncombat. The latter, though rapidly spreading, has not, we think, yet\r\ncome under our notice. The former error bears directly on practical\r\nquestions, and obstructs useful reforms. It may, therefore, seem to\r\nbe, and probably is, the more mischievous of the two. But the latter\r\nis equally absurd; it is at least equally symptomatic of a shallow\r\nunderstanding; and an unamiable temper: and, if it should ever become\r\ngeneral, it will, we are satisfied, produce very prejudicial effects.\r\nIts tendency is to deprive the benefactors of mankind of {274}their\r\nhonest fame, and to put the best and the worst men of past times on the\r\nsame level. The author of a great reformation is almost always unpopular\r\nin his own age. He generally passes his life in disquiet and danger. It\r\nis therefore for the interest of the human race that the memory of\r\nsuch men should be had in reverence, and that they should be supported\r\nagainst the scorn and hatred of their contemporaries by the hope of\r\nleaving a great and imperishable name. To go on the forlorn hope of\r\ntruth is a service of peril. Who will undertake it, if it be not also a\r\nservice of honour? It is easy enough, after the ramparts are carried,\r\nto find men to plant the flag on the highest tower. The difficulty is to\r\nfind men who are ready to go first into the breach; and it would be bad\r\npolicy indeed to insult their remains because they fell in the breach,\r\nand did not live to penetrate to the citadel.\r\n\r\nNow here we have a book which is by no means a favourable specimen of\r\nthe English literature of the nineteenth century, a book indicating\r\nneither extensive knowledge nor great powers of reasoning. And, if we\r\nwere to judge by the pity with which the writer speaks of the great\r\nstatesmen and philosophers of a former age, we should guess that he was\r\nthe author of the most original and important inventions in political\r\nscience. Yet not so: for men who are able to make discoveries are\r\ngenerally disposed to make allowances. Men who are eagerly pressing\r\nforward in pursuit of truth are grateful to every one who has cleared an\r\ninch of the way for them. It is, for the most part, the man who has\r\njust capacity enough to pick up and repeat the commonplaces which\r\nare fashionable in his own time who looks with disdain on the very\r\nintellects to which it is owing that those {275}commonplaces are not\r\nstill considered as startling paradoxes or damnable heresies. This\r\nwriter is just the man who, if he had lived in the seventeenth century,\r\nwould have devoutly believed that the Papists burned London, who would\r\nhave swallowed the whole of Oates’s story about the forty thousand\r\nsoldiers, disguised as pilgrims, who were to meet in Gallicia, and sail\r\nthence to invade England, who would have carried a Protestant flail\r\nunder his coat, and who would have been angry if the story of the\r\nwarmingpan had been questioned. It is quite natural that such a man\r\nshould speak with contempt of the great reformers of that time, because\r\nthey did not know some things which he never would have known but for\r\nthe salutary effects of their exertions. The men to whom we owe it that\r\nwe have a House of Commons are sneered at because they did not suffer\r\nthe debates of the House to be published. The authors of the Toleration\r\nAct are treated as bigots, because they did not go the whole length\r\nof Catholic Emancipation. Just so we have heard a baby, mounted on the\r\nshoulders of its father, cry out, “How much taller I am than Papa!”\r\n\r\nThis gentleman can never want matter for pride, if he finds it so\r\neasily. He may boast of an indisputable superiority to all the greatest\r\nmen of all past ages. He can read and write: Homer probably did not\r\nknow a letter. He has been taught that the earth goes round the sun:\r\nArchimedes held that the sun went round the earth. He is aware that\r\nthere is a place called New Holland: Columbus and Gama went to their\r\ngraves in ignorance of the fact. He has heard of the Georgium Sidus:\r\nNewton was ignorant of the existence of such a planet. He is acquainted\r\nwith the use of gunpowder: Hannibal and Cæsar won their {276}victories\r\nwith sword and spear. We submit, however, that this is not the way in\r\nwhich men are to be estimated.\r\n\r\nWe submit that a wooden spoon of our day would not be justified in\r\ncalling Galileo and Napier blockheads, because they never heard of the\r\ndifferential calculus. We submit that Caxton’s press in Westminster\r\nAbbey, rude as it is, ought to be looked at with quite as much respect\r\nas the best constructed machinery that ever, in our time, impressed the\r\nclearest type on the finest paper. Sydenham first discovered that the\r\ncool regimen succeeded best in cases of small-pox. By this discovery he\r\nsaved the lives of hundreds of thousands; and we venerate his memory\r\nfor it, though he never heard of inoculation. Lady Mary Montague brought\r\ninoculation into use; and we respect her for it, though she never heard\r\nof vaccination. Jenner introduced vaccination; we admire him for it, and\r\nwe shall continue to admire him for it, although some still safer and\r\nmore agreeable preservative should be discovered. It is thus that we\r\nought to judge of the events and the men of other times. They were\r\nbehind us. It could not be otherwise. But the question with respect to\r\nthem is not where they were, but which way they were going. Were their\r\nfaces set in the right or in the wrong direction? Were they in the front\r\nor in the rear of their generation? Did they exert themselves to help\r\nonward the great movement of the human race, or to stop it? This is not\r\ncharity, but simple justice and common sense. It is the fundamental law\r\nof the world in which we live that truth shall grow, first the blade,\r\nthen the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. A person who\r\ncomplains of the men of 1688 for not having been men of 1885 might just\r\nas well complain of a projectile for describing {277}a parabola, or of\r\nquicksilver for being heavier than water.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly we ought to look at ancient transactions by the light\r\nof modern knowledge. Undoubtedly it is among the first duties of\r\na historian to point out the faults of the eminent men of former\r\ngenerations. There are no errors which are so likely to be drawn into\r\nprecedent, and therefore none which it is so necessary to expose, as the\r\nerrors of persons who have a just title to the gratitude and admiration\r\nof posterity. In politics, as in religion, there are devotees who show\r\ntheir reverence for a departed saint by converting his tomb into a\r\nsanctuary for crime. Receptacles of wickedness are suffered to remain\r\nundisturbed in the neighbourhood of the church which glories in the\r\nrelics of some martyred apostle. Because he was merciful, his bones give\r\nsecurity to assassins. Because he was chaste, the precinct of his temple\r\nis filled with licensed stews. Privileges of an equally absurd kind\r\nhave been set up against the jurisdiction of political philosophy. Vile\r\nabuses cluster thick round every glorious event, round every venerable\r\nname; and this evil assuredly calls for vigorous measures of literary\r\npolice. But the proper course is to abate the nuisance without defacing\r\nthe shrine, to drive out the gangs of thieves and prostitutes without\r\ndoing foul and cowardly wrong to the ashes of the illustrious dead.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, two historians of our own time may be proposed as\r\nmodels, Sir James Mackintosh and Mr. Mill. Differing in most things, in\r\nthis they closely resemble each other. Sir James is lenient. Mr. Mill\r\nis severe. But neither of them ever omits, in the apportioning of praise\r\nand of censure, to make ample allowance for the state of political\r\nscience and political morality {278}in former ages. In the work before\r\nus, Sir James Mackintosh speaks with just respect of the Whigs of the\r\nRevolution, while he never fails to condemn the conduct of that party\r\ntowards the members of the Church of Rome. His doctrines are the liberal\r\nand benevolent doctrines of the nineteenth century. But he never forgets\r\nthat the men whom he is describing were men of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Mill this indulgence, or, to speak more properly, this justice,\r\nwas less to be expected. That gentleman, in some of his works, appears\r\nto consider politics not as an experimental, and therefore a progressive\r\nscience, but as a science of which all the difficulties may be resolved\r\nby short synthetical arguments drawn from truths of the most vulgar\r\nnotoriety. Were this opinion well founded, the people of one generation\r\nwould have little or no advantage over those of another generation.\r\nBut though Mr. Mill, in some of his Essays, has been thus misled, as we\r\nconceive, by a fondness for neat and precise forms of demonstration,\r\nit would be gross injustice not to admit that, in his History, he has\r\nemployed a very different method of investigation with eminent ability\r\nand success. We know no writer who takes so much pleasure in the truly\r\nuseful, noble, and philosophical employment of tracing the progress\r\nof sound opinions from their embryo state to their full maturity. He\r\neagerly culls from old despatches and minutes every expression in which\r\nhe can discern the imperfect germ of any great truth which has since\r\nbeen fully developed. He never fails to bestow praise on those who,\r\nthough far from coming up to his standard of perfection, yet rose in a\r\nsmall degree above the common level of their contemporaries. It is thus\r\nthat the annals of past times ought to be written. {279}It is thus,\r\nespecially, that the annals of our own country ought to be written.\r\n\r\nThe history of England is emphatically the history of progress. It is\r\nthe history of a constant movement of the public mind, of a constant\r\nchange in the institutions of a great society. We see that society, at\r\nthe beginning of the twelfth century, in a state more miserable than the\r\nstate in which the most degraded nations of the East now are. We see\r\nit subjected to the tyranny of a handful of armed foreigners. We see a\r\nstrong distinction of caste separating the victorious Norman from the\r\nvanquished Saxon. We see the great body of the population in a state\r\nof personal slavery. We see the most debasing and cruel superstition\r\nexercising boundless dominion over the most elevated and benevolent\r\nminds. We see the multitude sunk in brutal ignorance, and the studious\r\nfew engaged in acquiring what did not deserve the name of knowledge. In\r\nthe course of seven centuries the wretched and degraded race have become\r\nthe greatest and most highly civilised people that ever the world\r\nsaw, have spread their dominion over every quarter of the globe, have\r\nscattered the seeds of mighty empires and republics over vast continents\r\nof which no dim intimation had ever reached Ptolemy or Strabo, have\r\ncreated a maritime power which would annihilate in a quarter of an hour\r\nthe navies of Tyre, Athens, Carthage, Venice, and Genoa together,\r\nhave earned the science of healing, the means of locomotion and\r\ncorrespondence, every mechanical art, every manufacture, every thing\r\nthat promotes the convenience of life, to a perfection which our\r\nancestors would have thought magical, have produced a literature\r\nwhich may boast of works not inferior to the noblest which Greece has\r\n{280}bequeathed to us, have discovered the laws which regulate the\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies, have speculated with exquisite subtilty\r\non the operations of the human mind, have been the acknowledged leaders\r\nof the human race in the career of political improvement. The history of\r\nEngland is the history of this great change in the moral, intellectual,\r\nand physical state of the inhabitants of our own island. There is much\r\namusing and instructive episodical matter; but this is the main action.\r\nTo us, we will own, nothing is so interesting and delightful as to\r\ncontemplate the steps by which the England of Domesday Book, the England\r\nof the Curfew and the Forest Laws, the England of crusaders, monks,\r\nschoolmen, astrologers, seifs, outlaws, became the England which we know\r\nand love, the classic ground of liberty and philosophy, the school of\r\nall knowledge, the mart of all trade. The Charter of Henry Beauclerk,\r\nthe Great Charter, the first assembling of the House of Commons, the\r\nextinction of personal slavery, the separation from the See of Rome,\r\nthe Petition of Right, the Habeas Corpus Act, the Revolution, the\r\nestablishment of the liberty of unlicensed printing the abolition of\r\nreligious disabilities, the reform of the representative system, all\r\nthese seem to us to be the successive stages of one great revolution;\r\nnor can we fully comprehend any one of these memorable events unless we\r\nlook at it in connection with those which preceded, and with those which\r\nfollowed it. Each of those great and ever memorable struggles, Saxon\r\nagainst Norman, Villein against Lord, Protestant against Papist,\r\nRoundhead against Cavalier, Dissenter against Churchman, Manchester\r\nagainst Old Sa-rum, was, in its own order and season, a struggle, on\r\nthe result of which were staked the dearest interests of the {281}human\r\nrace; and every man who, in the contest which, in his time, divided our\r\ncountry, distinguished himself on the right side, is entitled to our\r\ngratitude and respect.\r\n\r\nWhatever the editor of this book may think, those persons who estimate\r\nmost correctly the value of the improvements which have recently been\r\nmade in our institutions, are precisely the persons who are least\r\ndisposed to speak slightingly of what was done in 1688. Such men\r\nconsider the Revolution as a reform, imperfect indeed, but still most\r\nbeneficial to the English people and to the human race, as a reform\r\nwhich has been the fruitful parent of reforms, as a reform, the happy\r\neffects of which are at this moment felt, not only throughout our own\r\ncountry, but in half the monarchies of Europe, and in the depths of the\r\nforests of Ohio. We shall be pardoned, we hope, if we call the attention\r\nof our readers to the causes and to the consequences of that great\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nWe said that the history of England is the history of progress; and,\r\nwhen we take a comprehensive view of it, it is so. But, when examined in\r\nsmall separate portions, it may with more propriety be called a history\r\nof actions and re-actions. We have often thought that the motion of the\r\npublic mind in our country resembles that of the sea when the tide is\r\nrising. Each successive wave rushes forward, breaks, and rolls back; but\r\nthe great flood is steadily coming in. A person who looked on the waters\r\nonly for a moment might fancy that they were retiring. A person who\r\nlooked on them only for five minutes might fancy that they were rushing\r\ncapriciously to and fro. But when he keeps his eye on them for a\r\nquarter of an hour, and sees one sea-mark disappear after another, it is\r\nimpossible for him to doubt of the general direction in which {282}the\r\nocean is moved. Just such has been the course of events in England. In\r\nthe history of the national mind, which is, in truth, the history of\r\nthe nation, we must carefully distinguish between that recoil which\r\nregularly follows every advance and a great general ebb. If we take\r\nshort intervals, if we compare 1640 and 1660, 1680 and 1685, 1708 and\r\n1712, 1782 and 1794, we find a retrogression. But if we take centuries,\r\nif, for example, we compare 1794 with 1660 or with 1685, we cannot doubt\r\nin which direction society is proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe interval which elapsed between the Restoration and the Revolution\r\nnaturally divides itself into three periods. The first extends from 1660\r\nto 1678, the second from 1678 to 1681, the third from 1681 to 1688.\r\n\r\nIn 1660 the whole nation was mad with loyal excitement. If we had to\r\nchoose a lot from among all the multitude of those which men have drawn\r\nsince the beginning of the world, we would select that of Charles the\r\nSecond on the day of his return. He was in a situation in which the\r\ndictates of ambition coincided with those of benevolence, in which it\r\nwas easier to be virtuous than to be wicked, to be loved, than to be\r\nhated, to earn pure and imperishable glory than to become infamous. For\r\nonce the road of goodness was a smooth descent. He had done nothing\r\nto merit the affection of his people. But they had paid him in advance\r\nwithout measure. Elizabeth, after the destruction of the Armada, or\r\nafter the abolition of monopolies, had not excited a thousandth part of\r\nthe enthusiasm with which the young exile was welcomed home. He was\r\nnot, like Lewis the Eighteenth, imposed on his subjects by foreign\r\nconquerors; nor did he, like Lewis the Eighteenth, come back to a\r\ncountry {283}which had undergone a complete change. The house of\r\nBourbon was placed in Paris as a trophy of the victory of the European\r\nconfederation. The return of the ancient princes was inseparably\r\nassociated in the public mind with the cession of extensive provinces,\r\nwith the payment of an immense tribute, with the devastation of\r\nflourishing departments, with the occupation of the kingdom by hostile\r\narmies, with the emptiness of those niches in which the gods of Athens\r\nand Rome had been the objects of a new idolatry, with the nakedness\r\nof those walls on which the Transfiguration had shone with light as\r\nglorious as that which overhung Mount Tabor. They came back to a land\r\nin which they could recognise nothing. The seven sleepers of the legend,\r\nwho closed their eyes when the Pagans were persecuting the Christians,\r\nand woke when the Christians were persecuting each other, did not find\r\nthemselves in a world more completely new to them. Twenty years had done\r\nthe work of twenty generations. Events had come thick. Men had lived\r\nfast. The old institutions and the old feelings had been torn up by the\r\nroots. There was a new Church founded and endowed by the usurper; a new\r\nnobility whose titles were taken from fields of battle, disastrous to\r\nthe ancient line; a new chivalry whose crosses had been won by exploits\r\nwhich had seemed likely to make the banishment of the emigrants\r\nperpetual. A new code was administered by a new magistracy. A new body\r\nof proprietors held the soil by a new tenure. The most ancient local\r\ndistinctions had been effaced. The most familiar names had become\r\nobsolete. There was no longer a Normandy or a Burgundy, a Brittany or a\r\nGuienne. The France of Lewis the Sixteenth had passed away as completely\r\nas one of the Preadamite {284}worlds. Its fossil remains might now and\r\nthen excite curiosity. But it was as impossible to put life into the\r\nold institutions as to animate the skeletons which are embedded in the\r\ndepths of primeval strata. It was as absurd to think that France could\r\nagain be placed under the feudal system, as that our globe could be\r\noverrun by mammoths. The revolution in the laws and in the form of\r\ngovernment was but an outward sign of that mightier revolution which\r\nhad taken place in the heart and brain of the people, and which affected\r\nevery transaction of life, trading, farming, studying, marrying, and\r\ngiving in marriage. The French whom the emigrant prince had to govern\r\nwere no more like the French of his youth, than the French of his youth\r\nwere like the French of the Jaquerie. He came back to a people who knew\r\nnot him nor his house, to a people to whom a Bourbon was no more than a\r\nCarlovin-gian or a Merovingian. He might substitute the white flag for\r\nthe tricolor; he might put lilies in the place of bees; he might order\r\nthe initials of the Emperor to be carefully effaced. But he could turn\r\nhis eyes nowhere without meeting some object which reminded him that he\r\nwas a stranger in the palace of his fathers. He returned to a country in\r\nwhich even the passing traveller is every moment reminded that there has\r\nlately been a great dissolution and reconstruction of the social system.\r\nTo win the hearts of a people, under such circumstances, would have been\r\nno easy task even for Henry the Fourth.\r\n\r\nIn the English Revolution the case was altogether different. Charles was\r\nnot imposed on his countrymen, but sought by them. His restoration was\r\nnot attended by any circumstance which could inflict a wound on their\r\nnational pride. Insulated by our geographical {285}position, insulated\r\nby our character, we had fought out our quarrels and effected our\r\nreconciliation among ourselves. Our great internal questions had never\r\nbeen mixed up with the still greater question of national independence.\r\nThe political doctrines of the Roundheads were not, like those of the\r\nFrench philosophers, doctrines of universal application. Our ancestors,\r\nfor the most part, took their stand, not on a general theory, but on the\r\nparticular constitution of the realm. They asserted the rights, not of\r\nmen, but of Englishmen. Their doctrines therefore were not contagious;\r\nand, had it been otherwise, no neighbouring country was then susceptible\r\nof the contagion. The language in which our discussions were generally\r\nconducted was scarcely known even to a single man of letters out of the\r\nislands. Our local situation made it almost impossible that we should\r\neffect great conquests on the Continent. The kings of Europe had,\r\ntherefore, no reason to fear that their subjects would follow the\r\nexample of the English Puritans, and looked with indifference, perhaps\r\nwith complacency, on the death of the monarch and the abolition of the\r\nmonarchy. Clarendon complains bitterly of their apathy. But we believe\r\nthat this apathy was of the greatest service to the royal cause. If a\r\nFrench or Spanish army had invaded England, and if that army had been\r\ncut to pieces, as we have no doubt that it would have been, on the\r\nfirst day on which it came face to face with the soldiers of Preston\r\nand Dunbar, with Colonel-Fight-the-good-Fight, and Captain\r\nSmite-them-hip-and-thigh, the House of Cromwell would probably now\r\nhave been reigning in England. The nation would have forgotten all\r\nthe misdeeds of the man who had cleared the soil of foreign invaders.\r\n{286}Happily for Charles, no European state, even when at war with the\r\nCommonwealth, chose to bind up its cause with that of the wanderers who\r\nwere playing in the garrets of Paris and Cologne at being princes and\r\nchancellors. Under the administration of Cromwell, England was more\r\nrespected and dreaded than any power in Christendom; and, even under\r\nthe ephemeral governments which followed his death, no foreign state\r\nventured to treat her with contempt. Thus Charles came back, not as a\r\nmediator between his people and a victorious enemy, but as a mediator\r\nbetween internal factions. He found the Scotch Covenanters and the Irish\r\nPapists alike subdued. He found Dunkirk and Jamaica added to the empire.\r\nHe was heir to the conquests and to the influence of the able usurper\r\nwho had excluded him.\r\n\r\nThe old government of England, as it had been far milder than the\r\nold government of France, had been far less violently and completely\r\nsubverted. The national institutions had been spared, or imperfectly\r\neradicated. The laws had undergone little alteration. The tenures of the\r\nsoil were still to be learned from Littleton and Coke. The Great\r\nCharter was mentioned with as much reverence in the parliaments of\r\nthe Commonwealth as in those of any earlier or of any later age. A\r\nnew Confession of Faith and a new ritual had been introduced into the\r\nchurch. But the bulk of the ecclesiastical property still remained. The\r\ncolleges still held their estates. The parson still received his\r\ntithes. The Lords had, at a crisis of great excitement, been excluded by\r\nmilitary violence from their House; but they retained their titles\r\nand an ample share of the public veneration. When a nobleman made his\r\nappearance in the House of Commons he was received with ceremonious\r\n{287}respect. Those few Peers who consented to assist at the\r\ninauguration of the Protector were placed next to himself, and the most\r\nhonourable offices of the day were assigned to them. We learn from the\r\ndebates of Richard’s Parliament how strong a hold the old aristocracy\r\nhad on the affections of the people. One member of the House of Commons\r\nwent so far as to say that, unless their Lordships were peaceably\r\nrestored, the country might soon be convulsed by a war of the Barons.\r\nThere was indeed no great party hostile to the Upper House. There was\r\nnothing exclusive in the constitution of that body. It was regularly\r\nrecruited from among the most distinguished of the country gentlemen,\r\nthe lawyers, and the clergy. The most powerful nobles of the century\r\nwhich preceded the civil war, the Duke of Somerset, the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland, Lord Seymour of Sudeley, the Earl of Leicester, Lord\r\nBurleigh, the Earl of Salisbury, the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of\r\nStrafford, had all been commoners, and had all raised themselves, by\r\ncourtly arts or by parliamentary talents, not merely to seats in the\r\nHouse of Lords, but to the first influence in that assembly. Nor had the\r\ngeneral conduct of the Peers been such as to make them unpopular. They\r\nhad not, indeed, in opposing arbitrary measures shown so much eagerness\r\nand pertinacity as the Commons. But still they had opposed those\r\nmeasures. They had, at the beginning of the discontents, a common\r\ninterest with the people. If Charles had succeeded in his scheme of\r\ngoverning without parliaments, the consequence of the Peers would have\r\nbeen grievously diminished. If he had been able to raise taxes by his\r\nown authority, the estates of the Peers would have been as much at\r\nhis mercy as those of the merchants or the farmers. If he had obtained\r\n{288}the power of imprisoning his subjects at his pleasure, a Peer\r\nran far greater risk of incurring the royal displeasure, and of being\r\naccommodated with apartments in the Tower, than any city trader or\r\ncountry squire. Accordingly Charles found that the Great Council of\r\nPeers which he convoked at York would do nothing for him. In the most\r\nuseful reforms which were made during the first session of the Long\r\nParliament, the Peers concurred heartily with the Lower House; and a\r\nlarge and powerful minority of the English nobles stood by the popular\r\nside through the first years of the war. At Edgehill, Newbury, gars ton,\r\nand Naseby, the armies of the Parliament were commanded by members\r\nof the aristocracy. It was not forgotten that a Peer had imitated the\r\nexample of Hampden in refusing the payment of the ship-money, or that\r\na Peer had been among the six members of the legislature whom Charles\r\nillegally impeached.\r\n\r\nThus the old constitution of England was without difficulty\r\nreestablished; and of all the parts of the old constitution the\r\nmonarchical part was, at the time, dearest to the body of the people.\r\nIt had been injudiciously depressed, and it was in consequence unduly\r\nexalted. From the day when Charles the First became a prisoner had\r\ncommenced a reaction in favour of his person and of his office. From the\r\nday when the axe fell on his neck before the windows of his palace, that\r\nreaction became rapid and violent. At the Restoration it had attained\r\nsuch a point that it could go no further. The people were ready to place\r\nat the mercy of their Sovereign all their most ancient and precious\r\nrights. The most servile doctrines were publicly avowed. The most\r\nmoderate and constitutional opposition was condemned. Resistance was\r\nspoken of with {289}more horror than any crime which a human being can\r\ncommit. The Commons were more eager than the King himself to avenge the\r\nwrongs of the royal house; more desirous than the bishops themselves to\r\nrestore the church; more ready to give money than the ministers to ask\r\nfor it. They abrogated the excellent law passed in the first session\r\nof the Long Parliament, with the general consent of all honest men, to\r\ninsure the frequent meeting of the great council of the nation. They\r\nmight probably have been induced to go further, and to restore the High\r\nCommission and the Star Chamber. All the contemporary accounts represent\r\nthe nation as in a state of hysterical excitement, of drunken joy. In\r\nthe immense multitude which crowded the beach at Dover, and bordered the\r\nroad along which the King travelled to London, there was not one who was\r\nnot weeping. Bonfires blazed. Bells jingled. The streets were thronged\r\nat night by boon-companions, who forced all the passers-by to swallow on\r\nbended knees brimming glasses to the health of his Most Sacred Majesty,\r\nand the damnation of Rednosed Noll. That tenderness to the fallen which\r\nhas, through many generations, been a marked feature of the national\r\ncharacter, was for a time hardly discernible. All London crowded to\r\nshout and laugh round the gibbet where hung the rotting remains of a\r\nprince who had made England the dread of the world, who had been the\r\nchief founder of her maritime greatness and of her colonial empire, who\r\nhad conquered Scotland and Ireland, who had humbled Holland and Spain,\r\nthe terror of whose name had been as a guard round every English\r\ntraveller in remote countries, and round every Protestant congregation\r\nin the heart of Catholic empires. When some of those brave and honest\r\n{290}though misguided men who had sat in judgment on their King were\r\ndragged on hurdles to a death of prolonged torture, their last prayers\r\nwere interrupted by the hisses and execrations of thousands.\r\n\r\nSuch was England in 1660. In 1678 the whole face of things had changed.\r\nAt the former of those epochs eighteen years of commotion had made the\r\nmajority of the people ready to buy repose at any price. At the latter\r\nepoch eighteen years of misgovernment had made the same majority\r\ndesirous to obtain security for their liberties at any risk. The fury\r\nof their returning loyalty had spent itself in its first outbreak. In\r\na very few months they had hanged and half-hanged, quartered and\r\nembowelled enough to satisfy them. The Roundhead party seemed to be not\r\nmerely overcome, but too much broken and scattered ever to rally again.\r\nThen commenced the reflux of public opinion. The nation began to find\r\nout to what a man it had intrusted without conditions, all its dearest\r\ninterests, on what a man it had lavished all its fondest affection. On\r\nthe ignoble nature of the restored exile, adversity had exhausted all\r\nher discipline in vain. He had one immense advantage over most other\r\nprinces. Though born in the purple, he was far better acquainted with\r\nthe vicissitudes of life and the diversities of character than most of\r\nhis subjects, He had known restraint, danger, penury, and dependence.\r\nHe had often suffered from ingratitude, insolence, and treachery. He\r\nhad received many signal proofs of faithful and heroic attachment He\r\nhad seen, if ever man saw, both sides of human nature. But only one side\r\nremained in his memory. He had learned only to despise and to distrust\r\nhis species, to consider integrity in men, and modesty in women, as\r\nmere acting; nor did he think it worth {291}while to keep his opinion to\r\nhimself. He was incapable of friendship; yet he was perpetually led by\r\nfavourites without being in the smallest degree duped by them. He knew\r\nthat their regard to his interests was all simulated; but from a\r\ncertain easiness which had no connection with humanity, he submitted,\r\nhalf-laughing at himself, to be made the tool of any woman whose person\r\nattracted him, or of any man whose tattle diverted him. He thought\r\nlittle and cared less about religion. He seems to have passed his life\r\nin dawdling suspense between Hobbism and Popery. He was crowned in\r\nhis youth with the Covenant in his hand; he died at last with the Host\r\nsticking in his throat, and, during most of the intermediate years, was\r\noccupied in persecuting both Covenanters and Catholics. He was not\r\na tyrant from the ordinary motives. He valued power for its own sake\r\nlittle, and fame still less. He does not appear to have been vindictive,\r\nor to have found any pleasing excitement in cruelty. What he wanted was\r\nto be amused, to get through the twenty-four hours pleasantly without\r\nsitting down to dry business. Sauntering was, as Sheffield expresses it,\r\nthe true Sultana Queen of his Majesty’s affections. A sitting in council\r\nwould have been insupportable to him if the Duke of Buckingham had not\r\nbeen there to make mouths at the Chancellor. It has been said, and is\r\nhighly probable, that in his exile he was quite disposed to sell his\r\nrights to Cromwell for a good round sum. To the last, his only quarrel\r\nwith his Parliaments was that they often gave him trouble, and would\r\nnot always give him money. If there was a person for whom he felt a real\r\nregard, that person was his brother. If there was a point about which he\r\nreally entertained a scruple of conscience or of honour, that point\r\nwas the descent {292}of the crown. Yet he was willing to consent to the\r\nExclusion Bill for six hundred thousand pounds; and the negotiation was\r\nbroken off only because he insisted on being paid beforehand. To do him\r\njustice, his temper was good; his manners agreeable; his natural\r\ntalents above mediocrity. But he was sensual, frivolous, false, and\r\ncold-hearted, beyond almost any prince of whom history makes mention.\r\n\r\nUnder the government of such a man, the English people could not be long\r\nin recovering from the intoxication of loyalty. They were then, as\r\nthey are still, a brave, proud, and high-spirited race, unaccustomed to\r\ndefeat, to shame, or to servitude. The splendid administration of Oliver\r\nhad taught them to consider their country as a match for the greatest\r\nempires of the earth, as the first of maritime powers, as the head\r\nof the Protestant interest. Though, in the day of their affectionate\r\nenthusiasm, they might sometimes extol the royal prerogative in tenus\r\nwhich would have better become the courtiers of Aurungzebe, they were\r\nnot men whom it was quite safe to take at their word. They were much\r\nmore perfect in the theory than in the practice of passive obedience.\r\nThough they might deride the austere manners and scriptural phrases of\r\nthe Puritans they were still at heart a religious people. The majority\r\nsaw no great sin in field-sports, stage-plays, promiscuous dancing,\r\ncards, fairs, starch, or false hair. But gross profaneness and\r\nlicentiousness were regarded with general horror; and the Catholic\r\nreligion was held in utter detestation by nine tenths of the middle\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nation which, awaking from its rapturous trance, found\r\nitself sold to a foreign, a despotic, a Popish court, defeated on its\r\nown seas and rivers {293}by a state of far inferior resources, and\r\nplaced under the rule of pandars and buffoons. Our ancestors saw the\r\nbest and ablest divines of the age turned out of their benefices by\r\nhundreds. They saw the prisons filled with men guilty of no other\r\ncrime than that of worshipping God according to the fashion generally\r\nprevailing throughout Protestant Europe. They saw a Popish Queen on the\r\nthrone, and a Popish heir on the steps of the throne. They saw unjust\r\naggression followed by feeble war, and feeble war ending in disgraceful\r\npeace. They saw a Dutch fleet riding triumphant in the Thames. They saw\r\nthe Triple Alliance broken, the Exchequer shut up, the public credit\r\nshaken, the arms of England employed, in shameful subordination to\r\nFrance, against a country which seemed to be the last asylum of civil\r\nand religious liberty. They saw Ireland discontented, and Scotland in\r\nrebellion. They saw, meantime, Whitehall swarming with sharpers and\r\ncourtesans. They saw harlot after harlot, and bastard after bastard, not\r\nonly raised to the highest honours of the peerage, but supplied out of\r\nthe spoils of the honest, industrious, and ruined public creditor, with\r\nample means of supporting the new dignity. The government became more\r\nodious every day. Even in the bosom of that very House of Commons which\r\nhad been elected by the nation in the ecstasy of its penitence, of\r\nits joy, and of its hope, an opposition sprang up and became powerful.\r\nLoyalty which had been proof against all the disasters of the civil war,\r\nwhich had survived the routs of Naseby and Worcester, which had never\r\nflinched from sequestration and exile, which the Protector could never\r\nintimidate or seduce, began to fail in this last and hardest trial. The\r\nstorm had long been gathering. At {294}length it burst with a fury which\r\nthreatened the whole frame of society with dissolution.\r\n\r\nWhen the general election of January, 1679, took place, the nation had\r\nretraced the path which it had been describing from 1640 to 1660. It was\r\nagain in the same mood in which it had been when, after twelve years\r\nof misgovernment, the Long Parliament assembled. In every part of the\r\ncountry, the name of courtier had become a by-word of reproach. The old\r\nwarriors of the Covenant again ventured out of those retreats in which\r\nthey had, at the time of the Restoration, hidden themselves from the\r\ninsults of the triumphant Malignants, and in which, during twenty rears,\r\nthey had preserved in full vigour\r\n\r\n                        “The unconquerable will\r\n\r\n                   And study of revenge, immortal hate,\r\n\r\n                   With courage never to submit or yield,\r\n\r\n                   And what is else not to be overcome.”\r\n\r\nThen were again seen in the streets faces which called up strange\r\nand terrible recollections of the days when the saints, with the high\r\npraises of God in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands,\r\nhad bound kings with chains, and nobles with links of iron. Then were\r\nagain heard voices which had shouted “Privilege” by the coach of\r\nCharles I. in the time of his tyranny, and had called for “Justice” in\r\nWestminster Hall on the day of his trial. It has been the fashion to\r\nrepresent the excitement of this period as the effect of the Popish\r\nplot. To us it seems clear that the Popish plot was rather the effect\r\nthan the cause of the general agitation. It was not the disease, but a\r\nsymptom, though, like many other symptoms, it aggravated the severity of\r\nthe disease. In 1660 or 1661 it would have been utterly out of {295}the\r\npower of such men as Oates or Bedloe to give any serious disturbance to\r\nthe Government. They would have been laughed at, pilloried, well pelted,\r\nsoundly whipped, and speedily forgotten. In 1678 or 1679 there would\r\nhave been an outbreak, if those men had never been born. For years\r\nthings had been steadily tending to such a consummation. Society was one\r\nvast mass of combustible matter. No mass so vast and so combustible ever\r\nwaited long for a spark.\r\n\r\nRational men, we suppose, are now fully agreed that by far the greater\r\npart, if not the whole, of Oates’s story was a pure fabrication. It is\r\nindeed highly probable that, during his intercourse with the Jesuits, he\r\nmay have heard much wild talk about the best means of reestablishing the\r\nCatholic religion in England, and that from some of the absurd daydreams\r\nof the zealots with whom he then associated he may have taken hints\r\nfor his narrative. But we do not believe that he was privy to any thing\r\nwhich deserved the name of conspiracy. And it is quite certain that, if\r\nthere be any small portion of truth in his evidence, that portion is\r\nso deeply buried in falsehood that no human skill can now effect a\r\nseparation. We must not, however, forget, that we see his story by the\r\nlight of much information which his contemporaries did not at first\r\npossess. We have nothing to say for the witnesses, but something in\r\nmitigation to offer on behalf of the public. We own that the credulity\r\nwhich the nation showed on that occasion seems to us, though censurable\r\nindeed, yet not wholly inexcusable.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors knew, from the experience of several generations at home\r\nand abroad, how restless and encroaching was the disposition of the\r\nChurch of Rome. {296}The heir-apparent of the crown was a bigoted member\r\nof that church. The reigning King seemed far more inclined to show\r\nfavour to that church than to the Presbyterians. He was the intimate\r\nally, or rather the hired servant, of a powerful King, who had already\r\ngiven proofs of his determination to tolerate within his dominions no\r\nother religion than that of Rome. The Catholics had begun to talk a\r\nbolder language than formerly, and to anticipate the restoration\r\nof their worship in all its ancient dignity and splendour. At this\r\njuncture, it is rumoured that a Popish plot has been discovered. A\r\ndistinguished Catholic is arrested on suspicion. It appears that he has\r\ndestroyed almost all his papers. A few letters, however, have escaped\r\nthe flames; and these letters are found to contain much alarming matter,\r\nstrange expressions about subsidies from France, allusions to a vast\r\nscheme which would “give the greatest blow to the Protestant religion\r\nthat it had ever received,” and which “would utterly subdue a pestilent\r\nheresy.” It was natural that those who saw these expressions, in letters\r\nwhich had been overlooked, should suspect that there was some horrible\r\nvillany in those which had been carefully destroyed. Such was the\r\nfeeling of the House of Commons: “Question, question, Coleman’s\r\nletters!” was the cry which drowned the voices of the minority.\r\n\r\nJust after the discovery of these papers, a magistrate who had\r\nbeen distinguished by his independent spirit, and who had taken the\r\ndeposition of the informer, is found murdered, under circumstances which\r\nmake it almost incredible that he should have fallen either by robbers\r\nor by his own hands. Many of our readers can remember the state of\r\nLondon just after the murders {297}of Mar and Williamson, the terror\r\nwhich was on every face, the careful barring of doors, the providing\r\nof blunderbusses and watchmen’s rattles. We know of a shopkeeper who on\r\nthat occasion sold three hundred rattles in about ten hours. Those who\r\nremember that panic may be able to form some notion of the state of\r\nEngland after the death of Godfrey. Indeed, we must say that, after\r\nhaving read and weighed all the evidence now extant on that mysterious\r\nsubject, we incline to the opinion that he was assassinated, and\r\nassassinated by Catholics, not assuredly by Catholics of the least\r\nweight or note, but by some of those crazy and vindictive fanatics who\r\nmay be found in every large sect, and who are peculiarly likely to\r\nbe found in a persecuted sect. Some of the violent Cameronians had\r\nrecently, under similar exasperation, committed similar crimes.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that there should be a panic; and it was natural that\r\nthe people should, in a panic, be unreasonable and credulous. It must\r\nbe remembered also that they had not at first, as we have, the means of\r\ncomparing the evidence which was given on different trials. They were\r\nnot aware of one tenth part of the contradictions and absurdities which\r\nOates had committed. The blunders, for example, into which he fell\r\nbefore the Council, his mistake about the person of Don John of Austria,\r\nand about the situation of the Jesuits’ College at Paris, were not\r\npublicly known. He was a bad man; but the spies and deserters by whom\r\ngovernments are informed of conspiracies are generally bad men. His\r\nstory was strange and romantic; but it was not more strange or romantic\r\nthan a well-authenticated Popish plot, which some few people then living\r\nmight remember, the Gunpowder treason. Oates’s account of the burning\r\nof London was in itself not more im {298}probable than the project of\r\nblowing up King, Lords, and Commons, a project which had not only been\r\nentertained by very distinguished Catholics, but which had very narrowly\r\nmissed of success. As to the design on the King’s person, all the world\r\nknew that, within a century, two kings of France and a prince of Orange\r\nhad been murdered by Catholics, purely from religious enthusiasm, that\r\nElizabeth had been in constant danger of a similar fate, and that such\r\nattempts, to say the least, had not been discouraged by the highest\r\nauthority of the Church of Rome. The characters of some of the accused\r\npersons stood high; but so did that of Anthony Babington, and that of\r\nEverard Digby. Those who suffered denied their guilt to the last; but\r\nno persons versed in criminal proceedings would attach any importance\r\nto this circumstance. It was well known also that the most distinguished\r\nCatholic casuists had written largely in defence of regicide, of mental\r\nreservation and of equivocation. It was not quite impossible that men\r\nwhose minds had been nourished with the writings of such casuists might\r\nthink themselves justified in denying a charge which, if acknowledged,\r\nwould bring great scandal on the Church. The trials of the accused\r\nCatholics were exactly like all the state trials of those days; that is\r\nto say, as infamous as they could be. They were neither fairer nor less\r\nfair than those of Algernon Sydney, of Rosewell, of Cornish, of all the\r\nunhappy men, in short, whom a predominant party brought to what was\r\nthen facetiously called justice. Till the Revolution purified our\r\ninstitutions and our manners, a state-trial was merely a murder preceded\r\nby the uttering of certain gibberish and the performance of certain\r\nmummeries.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition had now the great body of the {299}nation with them.\r\nThrice the King dissolved the Parliament; and thrice the constituent\r\nbody sent him back representatives fully determined to keep strict watch\r\non all his measures, and to exclude his brother from the throne. Had\r\nthe character of Charles resembled that of his father, this intestine\r\ndiscord would infallibly have ended in a civil war. Obstinacy and\r\npassion would have been his ruin. His levity and apathy were his\r\nsecurity. He resembled one of those light Indian boats which are safe\r\nbecause they are pliant, which yield to the impact of every wave, and\r\nwhich therefore bound without danger through a surf in which a vessel\r\nribbed with heart of oak would inevitably perish. The only thing about\r\nwhich his mind was unalterably made up was that, to use his own phrase,\r\nhe would not go on his travels again for any body or for any thing. His\r\neasy, indolent behaviour produced all the effects of the most artful\r\npolicy. He suffered things to take their course; and if Achitophel had\r\nbeen at one of his ears, and Machiavel at the other, they could have\r\ngiven him no better advice than to let things take their course. He gave\r\nway to the violence of the movement, and waited for the corresponding\r\nviolence of the rebound. He exhibited himself to his subjects in the\r\ninteresting character of an oppressed king, who was ready to do any\r\nthing to please them, and who asked of them in return, only some\r\nconsideration for his conscientious scruples and for his feelings of\r\nnatural affection, who was ready to accept any ministers, to grant any\r\nguarantees to public liberty, but who could not find it in his heart to\r\ntake away his brother’s birthright. Nothing more was necessary. He had\r\nto deal with a people whose noble weakness it has always been not to\r\npress too hardly on {300}the vanquisher, with a people the lowest and\r\nmost brutal of whom cry “Shame!” if they see a man struck when he is on\r\nthe ground. The resentment which the nation had felt towards the Court\r\nbegan to abate as soon as the Court was manifestly unable to offer\r\nany resistance. The panic which Godfrey’s death had excited gradually\r\nsubsided. Every day brought to light some new falsehood or contradiction\r\nin the stories of Oates and Bedloe. The people were glutted with the\r\nblood of Papists, as they had, twenty years before, been glutted with\r\nthe blood of regicides. When the first sufferers in the plot were\r\nbrought to the bar, the witnesses for the defence were in danger of\r\nbeing torn in pieces by the mob. Judges, jurors, and spectators seemed\r\nequally indifferent to justice, and equally eager for revenge. Lord\r\nStafford, the last sufferer, was pronounced not guilty by a large\r\nminority of his peers; and when he protested his innocence on the\r\nscaffold, the people cried out, “God bless you, my lord; we believe you,\r\nmy lord.” The attempt to make a son of Lucy Waters King of England was\r\nalike offensive to the pride of the nobles and to the moral feeling\r\nof the middle class. The old Cavalier party, the great majority of the\r\nlanded gentry, the clergy and the universities almost to a man, began to\r\ndraw together, and to form in close array round the throne.\r\n\r\nA similar reaction had begun to take place in favour of Charles the\r\nFirst during the second session of the Long Parliament; and, if that\r\nprince had been holiest or sagacious enough to keep himself strictly\r\nwithin the limits of the law, we have not the smallest doubt that he\r\nwould in a few months have found himself at least as powerful as his\r\nbest friends, Lord Falkland, Culpeper, {301}or Hyde, would have wished\r\nto see him. By illegally impeaching the leaders of the Opposition, and\r\nby making in person a wicked attempt on the House of Commons, he stopped\r\nand turned back that tide of loyal feeling which was just beginning to\r\nrun strongly. The son, quite as little restrained by law or by honour\r\nas the father, was, luckily for himself, a man of a lounging, careless\r\ntemper, and, from temper, we believe, rather than from policy, escaped\r\nthat great error which cost the father so dear. Instead of trying to\r\npluck the fruit before it was ripe, he lay still till it fell mellow\r\ninto his very mouth. If he had arrested Lord Shaftesbury and Lord\r\nRussell in a manner not warranted by law, it is not improbable that he\r\nwould have ended his life in exile. He took the sure course. He employed\r\nonly his legal prerogatives, and he found them amply sufficient for his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the first eighteen or nineteen years of his reign, he had been\r\nplaying the game of his enemies. From 1678 to 1681, his enemies had\r\nplayed his game. They owed their power to his misgovernment. He owed the\r\nrecovery of his power to their violence. The great body of the people\r\ncame back to him after their estrangement with impetuous affection. He\r\nhad scarcely been more popular when he landed on the coast of Kent than\r\nwhen, after several years of restraint and humiliation, he dissolved his\r\nlast Parliament.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, while this flux and reflux of opinion went on, the cause\r\nof public liberty was steadily gaining. There had been a great reaction\r\nin favour of the throne at the Restoration. But the Star-Chamber, the\r\nHigh Commission, the Ship-money, had forever disappeared. There was\r\nnow another similar reaction. But the Habeas-Corpus Act had been passed\r\nduring {302}the short predominance of the Opposition, and it was not\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nThe King, however, supported as he was by the nation, was quite strong\r\nenough to inflict a terrible revenge on the party which had lately held\r\nhim in bondage. In 1681 commenced the third of those periods into which\r\nwe have divided the history of England from the Restoration to the\r\nRevolution. During this period a third great reaction took place. The\r\nexcesses of tyranny restored to the cause of liberty the hearts which\r\nhad been alienated from that cause by the excesses of faction. In 1681,\r\nthe King had almost his enemies at his feet. In 1688, the King was an\r\nexile in a strange land.\r\n\r\nThe whole of that machinery which had lately been in motion against the\r\nPapists was now put in motion against the Whigs, browbeating judges,\r\npacked juries, lying witnesses, clamorous spectators. The ablest chief\r\nof the party fled to a foreign country and died there. The most virtuous\r\nman of the party was beheaded. Another of its most distinguished members\r\npreferred a voluntary death to the shame of a public execution. The\r\nboroughs on which the government could not depend were, by means of\r\nlegal quibbles, deprived of their charters; and their constitution\r\nwas remodelled in such a manner as almost to insure the return of\r\nrepresentatives devoted to the Court. All parts of the kingdom emulously\r\nsent up the most extravagant assurances of the love which they bore to\r\ntheir sovereign, and of the abhorrence with which they regarded those\r\nwho questioned the divine origin or the boundless extent of his power.\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that, in this hot competition of bigots\r\nand slaves, the University of Oxford had the unquestioned preeminence.\r\n{303}The glory of being farther behind the age than any other portion of\r\nthe British people, is one which that learned body acquired early, and\r\nhas never lost.\r\n\r\nCharles died, and his brother came to the throne; but, though the person\r\nof the sovereign was changed, the love and awe with which the office was\r\nregarded were undiminished. Indeed, it seems that, of the two princes,\r\nJames was, in spite of his religion, rather the favourite of the High\r\nChurch party. He had been specially singled out as the mark of the\r\nWhigs; and this circumstance sufficed to make him the idol of the\r\nTories. He called a parliament. The loyal gentry of the counties and the\r\npacked voters of the remodelled boroughs gave him a parliament such as\r\nEngland had not seen for a century, a parliament beyond all comparison\r\nthe most obsequious that ever sat under a prince of the House of Stuart.\r\nOne insurrectionary movement, indeed, took place in England and another\r\nin Scotland. Both were put down with ease, and punished with tremendous\r\nseverity. Even after that bloody circuit, which will never be forgotten\r\nwhile the English race exists in any part of the globe, no member of\r\nthe House of Commons ventured to whisper even the mildest censure\r\non Jeffreys. Edmund Waller, emboldened by his great age and his high\r\nreputation, attacked the cruelty of the military chiefs; and this is the\r\nbrightest part of his long and checkered public life. But even Waller\r\ndid not venture to arraign the still more odious cruelty of the Chief\r\nJustice. It is hardly too much to say that James, at that time, had\r\nlittle reason to envy the extent of authority possessed by Lewis the\r\nFourteenth.\r\n\r\nBy what means this vast power was in three years {304}broken down, by\r\nwhat perverse and frantic misgovernment the tyrant revived the spirit\r\nof the vanquished Whigs, turned to fixed hostility the neutrality of the\r\ntrimmers, and drove from him the landed gentry, the Church, the army,\r\nhis own creatures, his own children, is well known to our readers. But\r\nwe wish to say something about one part of the question, which in our\r\nown time has a little puzzled some very worthy men, and about which the\r\nauthor of the Continuation before us has said much with which we can by\r\nno means concur.\r\n\r\nJames, it is said, declared himself a supporter of toleration. If\r\nhe violated the constitution, he at least violated it for one of the\r\nnoblest ends that any statesman ever had in view. His object was to free\r\nmillions of his subjects from penal laws and disabilities which hardly\r\nany person now considers as just. He ought, therefore, to be regarded as\r\nblameless, or, at worst, as guilty only of employing irregular means\r\nto effect a most praiseworthy purpose. A very ingenious man, whom we\r\nbelieve to be a Catholic, Mr. Banim, has written a historical novel, of\r\nthe literary merit of which we cannot speak very highly, for the purpose\r\nof inculcating this opinion. The editor of Mackintosh’s Fragment assures\r\nus, that the standard of James bore the nobler inscription, and so\r\nforth; the meaning of which is, that William and the other authors of\r\nthe Revolution were vile Whigs who drove out James for being a Radical:\r\nthat the crime of the King; was his going farther in liberality than\r\nhis subjects; that he was the real champion of freedom; and that Somers,\r\nLocke, Newton, and other narrow-minded people of the same sort, were the\r\nreal bigots and oppressors.\r\n\r\nNow, we admit that if the premises can be made out, {305}the conclusion\r\nfollows. If it can be shown that James did sincerely wish to establish\r\nperfect freedom of conscience, we shall think his conduct deserving\r\nof indulgence, if not of praise. We shall not be inclined to censure\r\nharshly even his illegal acts. We conceive that so noble and salutary an\r\nobject would have justified resistance on the part of subjects. We can\r\ntherefore scarcely deny that it would at least excuse encroachment on\r\nthe part of a king. But it can be proved, we think, by the strongest\r\nevidence, that James had no such object in view; and that, under the\r\npretence of establishing perfect religious liberty, he was trying to\r\nestablish the ascendency and the exclusive dominion of the Church of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nIt is true that he professed himself a supporter of toleration. Every\r\nsect clamours for toleration when it is down. We have not the smallest\r\ndoubt that, when Bonner was in the Marshalsea, he thought it a very hard\r\nthing that a man should be locked up in a gaol for not being able to\r\nunderstand the words, “This is my body,” in the same way with the lords\r\nof the council. It would not be very wise to conclude that a beggar is\r\nfull of Christian charity, because he assures you that God will reward\r\nyou if you give him a penny; or that a soldier is humane, because he\r\ncries out lustily for quarter when a bayonet is at his throat. The\r\ndoctrine which, from the very first origin of religious dissensions, has\r\nbeen held by all bigots of all sects, when condensed into a few words,\r\nand stripped of rhetorical disguise, is simply this: I am in the\r\nright, and you are in the wrong. When you are the stronger you ought to\r\ntolerate me; for it is your duty to tolerate truth. But when I am the\r\nstronger, I shall persecute you; for it is my duty to persecute error.\r\n{306}The Catholics lay under severe restraints in England. James wished\r\nto remove those restraints; and therefore he held a language favourable\r\nto liberty of conscience. But the whole history of his life proves\r\nthat this was a mere pretence. In 1679 he held similar language, in a\r\nconversation with the magistrates of Amsterdam; and the author of the\r\nContinuation refers to this circumstance as a proof that the King had\r\nlong entertained a strong feeling on the subject. Unhappily it proves\r\nonly the utter insincerity of all the King’s later professions. If he\r\nhad pretended to be converted to the doctrines of toleration after his\r\naccession to the throne, some credit might have been due to him. But we\r\nknow most certainly that, in 1679, and long after that year, James was a\r\nmost bloody and remorseless persecutor. After 1679, he was placed at\r\nthe head of the government of Scotland. And what had been his conduct\r\nin that country? He had hunted down the scattered remnant of the\r\nCovenanters with a barbarity of which no other prince of modern times,\r\nPhilip the Second excepted, had ever shown himself capable. He had\r\nindulged himself in the amusement of seeing the torture of the Boot\r\ninflicted on the wretched enthusiasts whom persecution had driven to\r\nresistance. After his accession, almost his first act was to obtain\r\nfrom the servile parliament of Scotland a law for inflicting death on\r\npreachers at conventicles held within houses, and on both preachers and\r\nhearers at conventicles held in the open air. All this he had done for a\r\nreligion which was not his own. All this he had done, not in defence\r\nof truth against error, but in defence of one damnable error against\r\nanother, in defence of the Episcopalian against the Presbyterian\r\napostasy. Lewis the Fourteenth is justly censured for {307}trying to\r\ndragoon his subjects to heaven. But it was reserved for James to torture\r\nand murder for the difference between two roads to hell. And this man,\r\nso deeply imbued with the poison of intolerance that, rather than not\r\npersecute at all, he would persecute people out of one heresy into\r\nanother, this man is held up as the champion of religious liberty. This\r\nman, who persecuted in the cause of the unclean panther, would not, we\r\nare told, have persecuted for the sake of the milk-white and immortal\r\nhind.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the conduct of James at the very time when he was\r\nprofessing zeal for the rights of conscience? Was he not even then\r\npersecuting to the very best of his power? Was he not employing all his\r\nlegal prerogatives, and many prerogatives which were not legal, for\r\nthe purpose of forcing his subjects to conform to his creed? While he\r\npretended to abhor the laws which excluded Dissenters from office, was\r\nhe not himself dismissing from office his ablest, his most experienced,\r\nhis most faithful servants, on account of their religious opinions? For\r\nwhat offence was Lord Rochester driven from the Treasury? He was closely\r\nconnected with the Royal House. He was at the head of the Tory party. He\r\nhad stood firmly by James in the most trying emergencies. But he would\r\nnot change his religion, and he was dismissed. That we may not be\r\nsuspected of overstating the case, Dr. Lingard, a very competent, and\r\nassuredly not a very willing witness, shall speak for us. “The King,”\r\n says that able but partial writer, “was disappointed: he complained\r\nto Barillon of the obstinacy and insincerity of the treasurer; and the\r\nlatter received from the French envoy a very intelligible hint that\r\nthe loss of office would result from his adhesion to his religious\r\n{308}creed. He was, however, inflexible; and James, after a long delay,\r\ncommunicated to him, but with considerable embarrassment and many tears,\r\nhis final determination. He had hoped, he said, that Rochester, by\r\nconforming to the Church of Rome, would have spared him the unpleasant\r\ntask; but kings must sacrifice their feelings to their duty.” And this\r\nwas the King who wished to have all men of all sects rendered alike\r\ncapable of holding office. These proceedings were alone sufficient to\r\ntake away all credit from his liberal professions; and such, as we learn\r\nfrom the despatches of the Papal Nuncio, was really the effect. “Pare,”\r\n says D’Adda, writing a few days after the retirement of Rochester, “pare\r\nche gli animi sono inaspriti della voce che corrtrà il popolo, d’esser\r\ncacciato il detto ministre per non essere Cattolico, perciô tirarsi al\r\nesterminio de Protestanti.” Was it ever denied that the favours of\r\nthe Crown were constantly bestowed and withheld purely on account of the\r\nreligious opinions of the claimants? And if these things were done in\r\nthe green tree, what would have been done in the dry? If James acted\r\nthus when he had the strongest motives to court his Protestant subjects,\r\nwhat course was he likely to follow when he had obtained from them all\r\nthat he asked?\r\n\r\nWho again was his closest ally? And what was the policy of that ally?\r\nThe subjects of James, it is true, did not know half the infamy of their\r\nsovereign. They did not know, as we know, that, while he was\r\nlecturing them on the blessings of equal toleration, he was constantly\r\ncongratulating his good brother Lewis on the success of that intolerant\r\npolicy which had turned the fairest tracts of France into deserts,\r\nand driven into exile myriads of the most peaceable, industrious, and\r\nskilful artisans in the world. But {309}the English did know that the\r\ntwo princes were bound together in the closest union. They saw their\r\nsovereign with toleration on his lips, separating himself from those\r\nstates which had first set the example of toleration, and connecting\r\nhimself by the strongest ties with the most faithless and merciless\r\npersecutor who could then be found on any continental throne.\r\n\r\nBy what advice again was James guided? Who were the persons in whom he\r\nplaced the greatest confidence, and who took the warmest interest in his\r\nschemes? The ambassador of France, the Nuncio of Rome, and Father Petre\r\nthe Jesuit. And is not this enough to prove that the establishment of\r\nequal toleration was not his plan? Was Lewis for toleration? Was the\r\nVatican for toleration? Was the order of Jesuits for toleration? We know\r\nthat the liberal professions of James were highly approved by those\r\nvery governments, by those very societies, whose theory and practice it\r\nnotorious was to keep no faith with heretics and to give no quarter to\r\nheretics. And are we, in order to save James’s reputation for sincerity,\r\nto believe that all at once those governments and those societies had\r\nchanged their nature, had discovered the criminality of all their former\r\nconduct, had adopted principles far more liberal than those of Locke, of\r\nLeighton, or of Tillotson? Which is the more probable supposition,\r\nthat the King who had revoked the edict of Nantes, the Pope under whose\r\nsanction the Inquisition was then imprisoning and burning, the religious\r\norder which, in every controversy in which it had ever been engaged, had\r\ncalled in the aid either of the magistrate or of the assassin, should\r\nhave become as thorough-going friends to religious liberty as Dr.\r\nFranklin and Mr. Jefferson, or that {310}a Jesuit-ridden bigot should be\r\ninduced to disemble for the good of the Church?\r\n\r\nThe game which the Jesuits were playing was no new game. A hundred years\r\nbefore they had preached up political freedom, just as they were now\r\npreaching up religious freedom. They had tried to raise the republicans\r\nagainst Henry the Fourth and Elizabeth, just as they were now trying to\r\nraise the Protestant Dissenters against the Established Church. In\r\nthe sixteenth century, the tools of Philip the Second were constantly\r\npreaching doctrines that bordered on Jacobinism, constantly insisting on\r\nthe right of the people to cashier kings, and of every private\r\ncitizen to plunge his dagger into the heart of a wicked ruler. In the\r\nseventeenth century, the persecutors of the Huguenots were crying\r\nout against the tyranny of the Established Church of England, and\r\nvindicating with the utmost fervour the right of every man to adore God\r\nafter his own fashion. In both cases they were alike insincere. In both\r\ncases the fool who had trusted them would have found himself miserably\r\nduped. A good and wise man would doubtless disapprove of the arbitrary\r\nmeasures of Elizabeth. Put would he have really served the interests of\r\npolitical liberty, if he had put faith in the professions of the Romish\r\ncasuists, joined their party, and taken a share in Northumberland’s\r\nrevolt, or in Babington’s conspiracy? Would he not have been assisting\r\nto establish a far worse tyranny than that which he was trying to put\r\ndown? In the same manner, a good and wise man would doubtless see\r\nvery much to condemn in the conduct of the Church of England under the\r\nStuarts. But was he therefore to join the King and the Catholics against\r\nthat Church? {311}And was it not plain that, by so doing, he would\r\nassist in setting up a spiritual despotism, compared with which the\r\ndespotism of the Establishment was as a little finger to the loins, as a\r\nrod of whips to a rod of scorpions?\r\n\r\nLewis had a far stronger mind than James. He had at least an equally\r\nhigh sense of honour. He was in a much less degree the slave of his\r\npriests. His Protestant subjects had all the security for their rights\r\nof conscience which law and solemn compact could give. Had that security\r\nbeen found sufficient? And was not one such instance enough for one\r\ngeneration?\r\n\r\nThe plan of James seems to us perfectly intelligible. The toleration\r\nwhich, with the concurrence and applause of all the most cruel\r\npersecutors in Europe, he was offering to his people, was meant simply\r\nto divide them. This is the most obvious and vulgar of political\r\nartifices. We have seen it employed a hundred times within our own\r\nmemory. At this moment we see the Carlists in France hallooing on the\r\nExtreme Left against the Centre Left. Four years ago the same trick was\r\npractised in England. We heard old buyers and sellers of boroughs, men\r\nwho had been seated in the House of Commons by the unsparing use of\r\nejectments, and who had, through their whole lives, opposed every\r\nmeasure which tended to increase the power of the democracy, abusing\r\nthe Reform Bill as not democratic enough, appealing to the labouring\r\nclasses, execrating the tyranny of the ten-pound householders, and\r\nexchanging compliments and caresses with the most noted incendiaries of\r\nour time. The cry of universal toleration was employed by James, just\r\nas the cry of universal suffrage was lately employed by some veteran\r\nTories. The object of the mock democrats of our {312}time was to produce\r\na conflict between the middle classes and the multitude, and thus\r\nto prevent all reform. The object of James was to produce a conflict\r\nbetween the Church and the Protestant Dissenters, and thus to facilitate\r\nthe victory of the Catholics over both.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe that he could have succeeded. But we do not think his\r\nplan so utterly frantic and hopeless as it has generally been thought;\r\nand we are sure that, if he had been allowed to gain his first point,\r\nthe people would have had no remedy left but an appeal to physical\r\nforce, which would have been made under most unfavourable circumstances.\r\nHe conceived that the Tories, hampered by their professions of\r\npassive obedience, would have submitted to his pleasure, and that the\r\nDissenters, seduced by his delusive promises of relief, would have given\r\nhim strenuous support. In this way he hoped to obtain a law, nominally\r\nfor the removal of all religious disabilities, but really for the\r\nexcluding of all Protestants from all offices. It is never to be\r\nforgotten that a prince who has all the patronage of the state in his\r\nhands can, without violating the letter of the law, establish whatever\r\ntest he chooses. And, from the whole conduct of James, we have not the\r\nsmallest doubt that he would have availed himself of his power to the\r\nutmost. The statute-book might declare all Englishmen equally capable\r\nof holding office; but to what end, if all offices were in the gift of\r\na sovereign resolved not to employ a single heretic? We firmly believe\r\nthat not one post in the government, in the army, in the navy, on\r\nthe bench, or at the bar, not one peerage, nay not one ecclesiastical\r\nbenefice in the royal gift, would have been bestowed on any Protestant\r\n{313}of any persuasion. Even while the King had still strong motives to\r\ndissemble, he had made a Catholic Dean of Christ Church and a Catholic\r\nPresident of Magdalen College. There seems to be no doubt that the See\r\nof York was kept vacant for another Catholic. If James had been suffered\r\nto follow this course for twenty years, every military man from a\r\ngeneral to a drummer, every officer of a ship, every judge, every King’s\r\ncounsel, every lord-lieutenant of a county, every justice of the peace,\r\nevery ambassador, every minister of state, every person employed in the\r\nroyal household, in the custom-house, in the postoffice, in the excise,\r\nwould have been a Catholic. The Catholics would have had a majority in\r\nthe House of Lords, even if that majority had been made, as Sunderland\r\nthreatened, by bestowing coronets on a whole troop of the Guards.\r\nCatholics would have had, we believe, the chief weight even in the\r\nConvocation. Every bishop, every dean, every holder of a crown living,\r\nevery head of every college which was subject to the royal power, would\r\nhave belonged to the Church of Rome. Almost all the places of liberal\r\neducation would have been under the direction of Catholics. The whole\r\npower of licensing books would have been in the hands of Catholics. All\r\nthis immense mass of power would have been steadily supported by the\r\narms and by the gold of France, and would have descended to an heir\r\nwhose whole education would have been conducted with a view to one\r\nsingle end, the complete reestablishment of the Catholic religion. The\r\nHouse of Commons would have been the only legal obstacle. But the rights\r\nof a great portion of the electors were at the mercy of the courts of\r\nlaw; and the courts of law were absolutely {314}dependent on the Crown.\r\nWe cannot therefore think it altogether impossible that a house might\r\nhave been packed which would have restored the days of Mary.\r\n\r\nWe certainly do not believe that this would have been tamely borne.\r\nBut we do believe that, if the nation had been deluded by the King’s\r\nprofessions of toleration, all this would have been attempted, and could\r\nhave been averted only by a most bloody and destructive contest, in\r\nwhich the whole Protestant population would have been opposed to the\r\nCatholics. On the one side would have been a vast numerical superiority.\r\nBut on the other side would have been the whole organization of an\r\neminent, and two great disciplined armies, that of James, and that\r\nof Lewis. We do not doubt that the nation would have achieved its\r\ndeliverance. But we believe that the struggle would have shaken the\r\nwhole fabric of society, and that the vengeance of the conquerors would\r\nhave been terrible and unsparing.\r\n\r\nBut James was stopped at the outset. He thought himself secure of the\r\nTories, because they professed to consider all resistance as sinful, and\r\nof the Protestant Dissenters, because he offered them relief. He was in\r\nthe wrong as to both. The error into which he fell about the Dissenters\r\nwas very natural. But the confidence which he placed in the loyal\r\nassurances of the High Church party, was the most exquisitely ludicrous\r\nproof of folly that a politician ever gave.\r\n\r\nOnly imagine a man acting for one single day on the supposition that\r\nall his neighbours believe all that they profess, and act up to all that\r\nthey believe. Imagine a man acting on the supposition that he may safely\r\noffer the deadliest injuries and insults to everybody who {315}says\r\nthat revenge is sinful; or that he may safely intrust all his property\r\nwithout security to any person who says that it is wrong to steal. Such\r\na character would be too absurd for the wildest farce. Yet the folly of\r\nJames did not stop short of this incredible extent. Because the clergy\r\nhad declared that resistance to oppression was in no case lawful,\r\nhe conceived that he might oppress them exactly as much as he chose,\r\nwithout the smallest danger of resistance. He quite forgot that, when\r\nthey magnified the royal prerogative, the prerogative was exerted on\r\ntheir side, that, when they preached endurance, they had nothing to\r\nendure, that, when they declared it unlawful to resist evil, none but\r\nWhigs and Dissenters suffered any evil. It had never occurred to\r\nhim that a man feels the calamities of his enemies with one sort of\r\nsensibility, and his own with quite a different sort. It had never\r\noccurred to him as possible that a reverend divine might think it the\r\nduty of Baxter and Bunyan to bear insults and to lie in dungeons without\r\nmurmuring, and yet, when he saw the smallest chance that his own prebend\r\nmight be transferred to some sly Father from Italy or Flanders, might\r\nbegin to discover much matter for useful meditation in the texts\r\ntouching Ehud’s knife and Jael’s hammer. His majesty was not aware, it\r\nshould seem, that people do sometimes reconsider their opinions; and\r\nthat nothing more disposes a man to reconsider his opinions than a\r\nsuspicion, that, if he adheres to them, he is very likely to be a beggar\r\nor a martyr. Yet it seems strange that these truths should have escaped\r\nthe royal mind Those Churchmen who had signed the Oxford Declaration in\r\nfavour of passive obedience had also signed the thirty-nine Articles.\r\nAnd yet the very man who confidently expected that, by a little coaxing\r\nand bullying, {316}he should induce them to renounce the Articles, was\r\nthunderstruck when he found that they were disposed to soften down the\r\ndoctrines of the Declaration. Nor did it necessarily follow that,\r\neven if the theory of the Tories had undergone no modification, their\r\npractice would coincide with their theory. It might, one should think,\r\nhave crossed the mind of a man of fifty, who had seen a great deal of\r\nthe world, that people sometimes do what they think wrong. Though a\r\nprelate might hold that Paul directs us to obey even a Nero, it might\r\nnot on that account he perfectly safe to treat the Right Reverend Father\r\nin God after the fashion of Nero, in the hope that he would continue\r\nto obey on the principles of Paul. The King indeed had only to look at\r\nhome. He was at least as much attached to the Catholic Church as any\r\nTory gentleman or clergyman could be to the Church of England. Adultery\r\nwas at least as clearly and strongly condemned by his Church as\r\nresistance by the Church of England. Yet his priests could not keep him\r\nfrom Arabella Sedley. While he was risking his crown for the sake of his\r\nsoul, he was risking his soul for the sake of an ugly, dirty mistress.\r\nThere is something delightfully grotesque in the spectacle of a man\r\nwho, while living in the habitual violation of his own known duties, is\r\nunable to believe that any temptation can draw any other person aside\r\nfrom the path of virtue.\r\n\r\nJames was disappointed in all his calculations. His hope was that the\r\nTories would follow their principles, and that the Non-conformists would\r\nfollow their interests. Exactly the reverse took place. The great\r\nbody of the Tories sacrificed the principle of non-resistance to their\r\ninterests; the great body of Non-conformists rejected the delusive\r\noffers of the King, and stood {317}firmly by their principles. The two\r\nparties whose strife had convulsed the empire during half a century\r\nwere united for a moment; and all the vast royal power which three\r\nyears before had seemed immovably fixed vanished at once like chaff in a\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\nThe very great length to which this article has already been extended\r\nmakes it impossible for us to discuss, as we had meant to do, the\r\ncharacters and conduct of the leading English statesmen at this crisis.\r\nBut we must offer a few remarks on the spirit and tendency of the\r\nRevolution of 1688.\r\n\r\nThe editor of this volume quotes the Declaration of Right, and tells us\r\nthat, by looking at it, we may “judge at a glance whether the authors of\r\nthe Revolution achieved all they might and ought, in their position, to\r\nhave achieved; whether the Commons of England did their duty to their\r\nconstituents, their country, posterity, and universal freedom.” We\r\nare at a loss to imagine how he can have read and transcribed the\r\nDeclaration of Right, and yet have so utterly misconceived its nature.\r\nThat famous document is, as its very name imports, declaratory, and\r\nnot remedial. It was never meant to be a measure of reform. It\r\nneither contained, nor was designed to contain, any allusion to those\r\ninnovations which the authors of the Revolution considered as desirable,\r\nand which they speedily proceeded to make. The Declaration was merely a\r\nrecital of certain old and wholesome laws which had been violated by\r\nthe Stuarts, and a solemn protest against the validity of any precedent\r\nwhich might be set up in opposition to those laws. The words run thus:\r\n“They do claim, demand, and insist upon all and singular the premises\r\nas their undoubted rights and liberties.” Before a man begins to make\r\nimprovements on his estate, {318}he must know its boundaries. Before a\r\nlegislature sits down to reform a constitution, it is fit to ascertain\r\nwhat that constitution really is. This is all that the Declaration\r\nwas intended to do; and to quarrel with it because it did not directly\r\nintroduce any beneficial changes is to quarrel with meat for not being\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the authors of the Revolution acted cannot be\r\nmistaken. They were perfectly aware that the English institutions stood\r\nin need of reform. But they also knew that an important point was gained\r\nif they could settle once for all, by a solemn compact, the matters\r\nwhich had, during several generations, been in controversy between the\r\nParliament and the Crown. They therefore most judiciously abstained from\r\nmixing up the irritating and perplexing question of what ought to be the\r\nlaw with the plain question of what was the law. As to the claims set\r\nforth in the Declaration of Right, there was little room for debate.\r\nWhigs and Tories were generally agreed as to the illegality of the\r\ndispensing power and of taxation imposed by the royal prerogative.\r\nThe articles were therefore adjusted in a very few days. But if the\r\nParliament had determined to revise the whole constitution, and to\r\nprovide new securities against misgovemment, before proclaiming the new\r\nsovereigns, months would have been lost in disputes. The coalition which\r\nhad delivered the country would have been instantly dissolved. The Whigs\r\nwould have quarrelled with the Tories, the Lords with the Commons, the\r\nChurch with the Dissenters; and all this storm of conflicting interests\r\nand conflicting theories would have been raging round a vacant throne.\r\nIn the mean time, the greatest power on the Continent was attacking\r\nour allies, and meditating a descent on our own territories. Dundee was\r\npreparing {319}to raise the Highlands. The authority of James was still\r\nowned by the Irish. If the authors of the Revolution had been fools\r\nenough to take this course, we have little doubt that Luxembourg would\r\nhave been upon them in the midst of their constitution-making. They\r\nmight probably have been interrupted in a debate on Filmer’s and\r\nSydney’s theories of government by the entrance of the musqueteers of\r\nLewis’s household, and have been marched off, two and two, to frame\r\nimaginary monarchies and commonwealths in the Tower. We have had in our\r\nown time abundant experience of the effects of such folly. We have seen\r\nnation after nation enslaved, because the friends of liberty wasted in\r\ndiscussions upon abstract questions the time which ought to have been\r\nemployed in preparing for vigorous national defence. This editor,\r\napparently, would have had the English Revolution of 1688 end as the\r\nRevolutions of Spain and Naples ended in our days. Thank God, our\r\ndeliverers were men of a very different order from the Spanish and\r\nNeapolitan legislators. They might, on many subjects, hold opinions\r\nwhich, in the nineteenth century, would not be considered as liberal.\r\nBut they were not dreaming pedants. They were statesmen accustomed\r\nto the management of great affairs. Their plans of reform were not so\r\nextensive as those of the lawgivers of Cadiz; but what they planned,\r\nthat they effected; and what they effected, that they maintained against\r\nthe fiercest hostility at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nTheir first object was to seat William on the throne; and they were\r\nright. We say this without any reference to the eminent personal\r\nqualities of William, or to the follies and crimes of James. If the two\r\nprinces had interchanged characters, our opinion would still {320}have\r\nbeen the same. It was even more necessary to England at that time that\r\nher king should be a usurper than that he should be a hero. There could\r\nbe no security for good government without a change of dynasty. The\r\nreverence for hereditary right and the doctrine of passive obedience had\r\ntaken such a hold on the minds of the Tories, that, if James had been\r\nrestored to power on any conditions, their attachment to him would in\r\nall probability have revived, as the indignation which recent oppression\r\nhad produced faded from their minds. It had become indispensable to have\r\na sovereign whose title to his throne was strictly bound up with the\r\ntitle of the nation to its liberties. In the compact between the Prince\r\nof Orange and the Convention, there was one most important article\r\nwhich, though not expressed, was perfectly understood by both parties,\r\nand for the performance of which the country had securities far better\r\nthan all the engagements that Charles the First or Ferdinand the Seventh\r\never took in the day of their weakness, and broke in the day of their\r\npower. The article to which we allude was this, that William would in\r\nall things conform himself to what should appear to be the fixed and\r\ndeliberate sense of his Parliament. The security for the performance\r\nwas this, that he had no claim to the throne except the choice of\r\nParliament, and no means of maintaining himself on the throne but the\r\nsupport of Parliament. All the great and inestimable reforms which\r\nspeedily followed the Revolution were implied in those simple\r\nwords; “The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, assembled at\r\nWestminster, do resolve that William and Mary, Prince and Princess of\r\nOrange, be, and be declared King and Queen of England.”\r\n\r\nAnd what were the reforms of which we speak? We {321}will shortly\r\nrecount some which we think the most important; and we will then leave\r\nour readers to judge whether those who consider the Revolution as a mere\r\nchange of dynasty, beneficial to a few aristocrats, but useless to\r\nthe body of the people, or those who consider it as a happy era in the\r\nhistory of the British nation and of the human species, have judged more\r\ncorrectly of its nature.\r\n\r\nForemost in the list of the benefits which our country owes to the\r\nRevolution we place the Toleration Act. It is true that this measure\r\nfell short of the wishes of the leading Whigs. It is true also that,\r\nwhere Catholics were concerned, even the most enlightened of the leading\r\nWhigs held opinions by no means so liberal as those which are happily\r\ncommon at the present day. Those distinguished statesmen did however\r\nmake a noble, and, in some respects, a successful straggle for the\r\nrights of conscience. Their wish was to bring the great body of the\r\nProtestant Dissenters within the pale of the Church by judicious\r\nalterations in the Liturgy and the Articles, and to grant to those who\r\nstill remained without that pale the most ample toleration. They framed\r\na plan of comprehension which would have satisfied a great majority of\r\nthe seceders; and they proposed the complete abolition of that absurd\r\nand odious test which, after having been, during a century and a half, a\r\nscandal to the pious and a laughing-stock to the profane, was at length\r\nremoved in our own time. The immense power of the Clergy and of the Tory\r\ngentry frustrated these excellent designs. The Whigs, however, did\r\nmuch. They succeeded in obtaining a law in the provisions of which\r\na philosopher will doubtless find much to condemn, but which had the\r\npractical effect of enabling almost every Protestant Nonconformist\r\n{322}to follow the dictates of his own conscience without molestation.\r\nScarcely a law in the statute-book is theoretically more objectionable\r\nthan the Toleration Act. But we question whether in the whole of that\r\nvast mass of legislation, from the Great Charter downwards, there be\r\na single law which has so much diminished the sum of human suffering,\r\nwhich has done so much to allay bad passions, which has put an end to so\r\nmuch petty tyranny and vexation, which has brought gladness, peace, and\r\na sense of security to so many private dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe second of those great reforms which the Revolution produced was the\r\nfinal establishment of the Presbyterian Kirk in Scotland. We shall not\r\nnow inquire whether the Episcopal or the Calvinistic form of Church\r\ngovernment be more agreeable to primitive practice. Far be it from us to\r\ndisturb with our doubts the repose of any Oxonian Bachelor of Divinity\r\nwho conceives that the English prelates with their baronies and palaces,\r\ntheir purple and their fine linen, their mitred carriages and their\r\nsumptuous tables, are the true successors of those ancient bishops who\r\nlived by catching fish and mending tents. We say only that the Scotch,\r\ndoubtless from their own inveterate stupidity and malice, were not\r\nEpiscopalians; that they could not be made Episcopalians; that the\r\nwhole power of government had been in vain employed for the purpose\r\nof converting them; that the fullest instruction on the mysterious\r\nquestions of the Apostolical succession and the imposition of hands had\r\nbeen imparted by the very logical process of putting the legs of the\r\nstudents into wooden boots, and driving two or more wedges between their\r\nknees; that a course of divinity lectures, of the most edifying kind,\r\nhad been given in {323}the grass-market of Edinburgh; yet that, in spite\r\nof all the exertions of those great theological professors, Lauderdale\r\nand Dundee, the Covenanters were as obstinate as ever. To the contest\r\nbetween the Scotch nation and the Anglican Church are to be ascribed\r\nnear thirty years of the most frightful misgovernment ever seen in any\r\npart of Great Britain. If the Revolution had produced no other effect\r\nthan that of freeing the Scotch from the yoke of an establishment which\r\nthey detested, and giving them one to which they were attached, it would\r\nhave been one of the happiest events in our history.\r\n\r\nThe third great benefit which the country derived from the Revolution\r\nwas the alteration in the mode of granting the supplies. It had been the\r\npractice to settle on every prince, at the commencement of his reign,\r\nthe produce of certain taxes which, it was supposed, would yield a\r\nsum sufficient to defray the ordinary expenses of government. The\r\ndistribution of the revenue was left wholly to the sovereign. He might\r\nbe forced by a war, or by his own profusion, to ask for an extraordinary\r\ngrant. But, if his policy were economical and pacific, he might reign\r\nmany years without once being under the necessity of summoning his\r\nParliament, or of taking their advice when he had summoned them. This\r\nwas not all. The natural tendency of every society in which property\r\nenjoys tolerable security is to increase in wealth. With the national\r\nwealth, the produce of the customs, of the excise, and of the\r\npost-office, would of course increase; and thus it might well happen\r\nthat taxes which, at the beginning of a long reign, were barely\r\nsufficient to support a frugal government in time of peace, might,\r\nbefore the end of that reign, enable the {324}sovereign to imitate the\r\nextravagance of Nero or Heliogabalus, to raise great armies, to carry\r\non expensive wars. Something of this sort had actually happened under\r\nCharles the Second, though his reign, reckoned from the Restoration,\r\nlasted only twenty-five years. His first Parliament settled on him taxes\r\nestimated to produce twelve hundred thousand pounds a year. This they\r\nthought sufficient, as they allowed nothing for a standing army in time\r\nof peace. At the time of Charles’s death, the annual produce of these\r\ntaxes considerably exceeded a million and a half; and the King\r\nwho, during the years which immediately followed his accession, was\r\nperpetually in distress, and perpetually asking his Parliaments for\r\nmoney, was at last able to keep a body of regular troops without any\r\nassistance from the House of Commons. If his reign had been as long as\r\nthat of George the Third, he would probably, before the close of it,\r\nhave been in the annual receipt of several millions over and above\r\nwhat the ordinary expenses of civil government required; and of those\r\nmillions he would have been as absolutely master as the King now is\r\nof the sum allotted for his privy-purse. He might have spent them in\r\nluxury, in corruption, in paying troops to overawe his people, or in\r\ncarrying into effect wild schemes of foreign conquest. The authors of\r\nthe Revolution applied a remedy to this great abuse. They settled on the\r\nKing, not the fluctuating produce of certain fixed taxes, but a fixed\r\nsum sufficient for the support of his own royal state. They established\r\nit as a rule that all the expenses of the army, the navy, and the\r\nordnance, should be brought annually under the review of the House\r\nof Commons, and that every sum voted should be applied to the service\r\nspecified in the vote. The direct effect of this {325}change was\r\nimportant. The indirect effect has been more important still. From that\r\ntime the House of Commons has been really the paramount power in the\r\nstate. It has, in truth, appointed and removed ministers, declared war,\r\nand concluded peace. No combination of the King and the Lords has ever\r\nbeen able to effect any thing against the Lower House, backed by its\r\nconstituents. Three or four times, indeed, the sovereign has been able\r\nto break the force of an opposition by dissolving the Parliament. But\r\nif that experiment should fail, if the people should be of the same mind\r\nwith their representatives, he would clearly have no course left but to\r\nyield, to abdicate, or to fight.\r\n\r\nThe next great blessing which we owe to the Revolution is the\r\npurification of the administration of justice in political cases. Of the\r\nimportance of this change no person can judge who is not well acquainted\r\nwith the earlier volumes of the State Trials. These volumes are, we do\r\nnot hesitate to say, the most frightful record of baseness and depravity\r\nthat is extant in the world. Our hatred is altogether turned away from\r\nthe crimes and the criminals, and directed against the law and its\r\nministers. We see villanies as black as ever were imputed to any\r\nprisoner at any bar daily committed on the bench and in the jury-box.\r\nThe worst of the bad acts which brought discredit on the old Parliaments\r\nof France, the condemnation of Lally, for example, or even that of\r\nCalas, may seem praiseworthy when compared with the atrocities which\r\nfollow each other in endless succession as we turn over that huge\r\nchronicle of the shame of England. The magistrates of Paris and Toulouse\r\nwere blinded by prejudice, passion, or bigotry. But the abandoned judges\r\nof our own country committed murder with their eyes open. {326}The cause\r\nof this is plain. In France there was no constitutional opposition. If\r\na man held language offensive to the government, he was at once sent to\r\nthe Bastile or to Vincennes. But in England, at least after the days\r\nof the Long Parliament, the King could not, by a mere act of his\r\nprerogative, rid himself of a troublesome politician. He was forced to\r\nremove those who thwarted him by means of perjured witnesses, packed\r\njuries, and corrupt, hard-hearted, browbeating judges. The Opposition\r\nnaturally retaliated whenever they had the upper hand. Every time that\r\nthe power passed from one party to the other, there was a proscription\r\nand a massacre, thinly disguised under the forms of judicial procedure.\r\nThe tribunals ought to be sacred places of refuge, where, in all the\r\nvicissitudes of public affairs, the innocent of all parties may find\r\nshelter. They were, before the Revolution, an unclean public shambles,\r\nto which each party in its turn dragged its opponents, and where each\r\nfound the same venal and ferocious butchers waiting for its custom.\r\nPapist or Protestant, Tory or Whig, Priest or Alderman, all was one to\r\nthose greedy and savage natures, provided only there was money to earn,\r\nand blood to shed.\r\n\r\nOf course, these worthless judges soon created around them, as was\r\nnatural, a breed of informers more wicked, if possible, than themselves.\r\nThe trial by jury afforded little or no protection to the innocent. The\r\njuries were nominated by the sheriffs. The sheriffs were in most\r\nparts of England nominated by the Crown. In London, the great scene\r\nof political contention, those officers were chosen by the people. The\r\nfiercest parliamentary election of our time will give but a faint notion\r\nof the storm which raged in the city on {327}the day when two interested\r\nparties, each bearing its badge, met to select the men in whose hands\r\nwere to be the issues of life and death for the coming year. On that\r\nday, nobles of the highest descent did not think it beneath them to\r\ncanvass and marshal the livery, to head the procession, and to watch\r\nthe poll. On that day, the great chiefs of parties waited in an agony\r\nof suspense for the messenger who was to bring from Guildhall the news\r\nwhether their lives and estates were, for the next twelve months, to\r\nbe at the mercy of a friend or of a foe. In 1681, Whig sheriffs were\r\nchosen; and Shaftesbury defied the whole power of the government. In\r\n1682 the sheriffs were Tories.\r\n\r\nShaftesbury fled to Holland. The other chiefs of the party broke up\r\ntheir councils, and retired in haste to their country-seats. Sydney\r\non the scaffold told those sheriffs that his blood was on their heads.\r\nNeither of them could deny the charge; and one of them wept with shame\r\nand remorse.\r\n\r\nThus every man who then meddled with public affairs, took his life in\r\nhis hand. The consequence was that men of gentle natures stood aloof\r\nfrom contests in which they could not engage without hazarding their own\r\nnecks and the fortunes of their children. This was the course adopted by\r\nSir William Temple, by Evelyn, and by many other men who were, in every\r\nrespect, admirably qualified to serve the State. On the other hand,\r\nthose resolute and enterprising men who put their heads and lands to\r\nhazard in the game of politics naturally acquired, from the habit of\r\nplaying for so deep a stake, a reckless and desperate turn of mind.\r\nIt was, we seriously believe, as safe to be a highwayman as to be a\r\ndistinguished leader of Opposition. This may serve to explain, and in\r\nsome degree {328}to excuse, the violence with which the factions of that\r\nage are justly reproached. They were fighting, not merely for office,\r\nbut for life. It they reposed for a moment from the work of agitation,\r\nif they suffered the public excitement to flag, they were lost men.\r\nHume, in describing this state of things, has employed an image which\r\nseems hardly to suit the general simplicity of his style, but which\r\nis by no means too strong for the occasion. “Thus,” says he, “the two\r\nparties actuated by mutual rage, but cooped up within the narrow limits\r\nof the law, levelled with poisoned daggers the most deadly blows against\r\neach other’s breast, and buried in their factious divisions all regard\r\nto truth, honour, and humanity.”\r\n\r\nFrom this terrible evil the Revolution set us free. The law which\r\nsecured to the judges them seats during life or good behaviour did\r\nsomething. The law subsequently passed for regulating trials in cases\r\nof treason did much more. The provisions of that law show, indeed, very\r\nlittle legislative skill. It is not framed on the principle of securing\r\nthe innocent, but on the principle of giving a great chance of escape to\r\nthe accused, whether innocent or guilty. This, however, is decidedly a\r\nfault on the right side. The evil produced by the occasional escape of\r\na bad citizen is not to be compared with the evils of that Reign of\r\nTerror, for such it was, which preceded the Revolution. Since the\r\npassing of this law scarcely one single person has suffered death\r\nin England as a traitor, who had not been convicted on overwhelming\r\nevidence, to the satisfaction of all parties, of the highest crime\r\nagainst the State. Attempts have been made in times of great excitement,\r\nto bring in persons guilty of high treason for acts which, though\r\nsometimes highly blamable, did {329}not necessarily imply a design\r\nfalling within the legal definition of treason. All those attempts have\r\nfailed. During a hundred and forty years no statesman, while engaged in\r\nconstitutional opposition to a government, has had the axe before his\r\neyes. The smallest minorities, struggling against the most powerful\r\nmajorities, in the most agitated times, have felt themselves perfectly\r\nsecure. Pulteney and Fox were the two most distinguished leaders of\r\nOpposition since the Revolution. Both were personally obnoxious to the\r\nCourt. But the utmost harm that the utmost anger of the Court could\r\ndo to them was to strike off the “Right Honourable” from before their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nBut of all the reforms produced by the Revolution, perhaps the most\r\nimportant was the full establishment of the liberty of unlicensed\r\nprinting. The Censorship which, under some form or other, had existed,\r\nwith rare and short intermissions, under every government, monarchical\r\nor republican, from the time of Henry the Eighth downwards, expired, and\r\nhas never since been renewed.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that the great improvements which we have recapitulated\r\nwere, in many respects, imperfectly and unskilfully executed. The\r\nauthors of those improvements sometimes, while they removed or mitigated\r\na great practical evil, continued to recognise the erroneous principle\r\nfrom which that evil had sprung. Sometimes when they had adopted a sound\r\nprinciple, they shrank from following it to all the conclusions to\r\nwhich it would have led them. Sometimes they failed to perceive that the\r\nremedies which they applied to one disease of the State were certain to\r\ngenerate another disease, and to render another remedy necessary. Their\r\nknowledge was inferior to ours: nor were they {330}always able to act\r\nup to their knowledge. The pressure of circumstances, the necessity of\r\ncompromising differences of opinion, the power and violence of the party\r\nwhich was altogether hostile to the new settlement, must be taken into\r\nthe account. When these things are fairly weighed, there will, we think,\r\nbe little difference of opinion among liberal and right-minded men as to\r\nthe real value of what the great events of 1688 did for this country.\r\n\r\nWe have recounted what appear to us the most important of those changes\r\nwhich the Revolution produced in our laws. The changes which it produced\r\nin our laws, however, were not more important than the change which\r\nit indirectly produced in the public mind. The Whig party had during\r\nseventy years, an almost uninterrupted possession of power. It had\r\nalways been the fundamental doctrine of that party, that power is a\r\ntrust for the people; that it is given to magistrates, not for\r\ntheir own, but for the public advantage; that, where it is abused by\r\nmagistrates, even by the highest of all, it may lawfully be withdrawn.\r\nIt is perfectly true, that the Whigs were not more exempt than other men\r\nfrom the vices and infirmities of our nature, and that, when they had\r\npower, they sometimes abused it. But still they stood firm to their\r\ntheory. That theory was the badge of their party. It was something more.\r\nIt was the foundation on which rested the power of the houses of Nassau\r\nand Brunswick. Thus, there was a government interested in propagating a\r\nclass of opinions which most governments are interested in discouraging,\r\na government which looked with complacency on all speculations\r\nfavourable to public liberty, and with extreme aversion on all\r\nspeculations {331}favourable to arbitrary power. There was a King who\r\ndecidedly preferred a republican to a believer in the divine right\r\nof kings; who considered every attempt to exalt his prerogative as an\r\nattack on his title; and who reserved all his favours for those who\r\ndeclaimed on the natural equality of men, and the popular origin of\r\ngovernment. This was the state of things from the Revolution till\r\nthe death of George the Second. The effect was what might have been\r\nexpected. Even in that profession which has generally been most disposed\r\nto magnify the prerogative, a great change took place. Bishopric\r\nafter bishopric and deanry after deanry were bestowed on Whigs\r\nand Latitudinarians. The consequence was that Whiggism and\r\nLatitudinarianism were professed by the ablest and most aspiring\r\nchurchmen.\r\n\r\nHume complained bitterly of this at the close of his history. “The Whig\r\nparty,” says he, “for a course of near seventy years, has almost without\r\ninterruption enjoyed the whole authority of government, and no honours\r\nor offices could be obtained but by their countenance and protection.\r\nBut this event, which in some particulars has been advantageous to\r\nthe state, has proved destructive to the truth of history, and has\r\nestablished many gross falsehoods, which it is unaccountable how any\r\ncivilised nation could have embraced, with regard to its domestic\r\noccurrences. Compositions the most despicable, both for style and\r\nmatter,”--in a note he instances the writings of Locke, Sydney, Hoadley,\r\nand Rapin,--“have been extolled and propagated and read as if they had\r\nequalled the most celebrated remains of antiquity. And forgetting that\r\na regard to liberty, though a laudable passion, ought commonly to\r\nbe subservient {332}to a reverence for established government, the\r\nprevailing faction has celebrated only the partisans of the former.” We\r\nwill not here enter into an argument about the merit of Rapin’s History\r\nor Locke’s political speculations. We call Hume merely as evidence to\r\na fact well known to all reading men, that the literature patronised by\r\nthe English Court and the English ministry, during the first half of\r\nthe eighteenth century, was of that kind which courtiers and ministers\r\ngenerally do all in their power to discountenance, and tended to\r\ninspire zeal for the liberties of the people rather than respect for the\r\nauthority of the government.\r\n\r\nThere was still a very strong Tory party in England. But that party was\r\nin opposition. Many of its members still held the doctrine of passive\r\nobedience. But they did not admit that the existing dynasty had any\r\nclaim to such obedience. They condemned resistance. But by resistance\r\nthey meant the keeping out of James the Third, and not the turning out\r\nof George the Second. No Radical of our times could grumble more at the\r\nexpenses of the royal household, could exert himself more strenuously\r\nto reduce the military establishment, could oppose with more earnestness\r\nevery proposition for arming the executive with extraordinary powers, or\r\ncould pour more unmitigated abuse on placemen and courtiers If a writer\r\nwere now, in a massive Dictionary, to define a Pensioner as a traitor\r\nand a slave, the Excise as a hateful tax, the Commissioners of the\r\nExcise as wretches, if he were to write a satire full of reflections on\r\nmen who receive “the price of boroughs and of souls,” who “explain their\r\ncountry’s dear-bought rights away,” {333}or\r\n\r\n                        “whom pensions can incite\r\n\r\n               To vote a patriot black, a courtier white,”\r\n\r\nwe should set him down for something more democratic than a Whig. Yet\r\nthis was the language which Johnson, the most bigoted of Tories and High\r\nChurchmen, held under the administration of Walpole and Pelham.\r\n\r\nThus doctrines favourable to public liberty were inculcated alike by\r\nthose who were in power and by those who were in opposition. It was by\r\nmeans of these doctrines alone that the former could prove that they\r\nhad a King _de jure_. The servile theories of the latter did not prevent\r\nthem from offering every molestation to one whom they considered as\r\nmerely a King _de facto_. The attachment of one party to the House of\r\nHanover, of the other to that of Stuart, induced both to talk a language\r\nmuch more favourable to popular rights than to monarchical power. What\r\ntook place at the first representation of Cato is no bad illustration\r\nof the way in which the two great sections of the community almost\r\ninvariably acted. A play, the whole merit of which consists in its\r\nstately rhetoric, a rhetoric sometimes not unworthy of Lucan, about\r\nhating tyrants and dying for freedom, is brought on the stage in a time\r\nof great political excitement. Both parties crowd to the theatre. Each\r\naffects to consider every line as a compliment to itself, and an\r\nattack on its opponents. The curtain falls amidst an unanimous roar of\r\napplause. The Whigs of the Kit Cat embrace the author, and assure\r\nhim that he has rendered an inestimable service to liberty. The Tory\r\nsecretary of state presents a purse to the chief actor for defending the\r\ncause of liberty so well. The history of that night was, in miniature,\r\nthe history of two generations. {334}We well know how much sophistry\r\nthere was in the reasonings, and how much exaggeration in the\r\ndeclamations of both parties. But when we compare the state in which\r\npolitical science was at the close of the reign of George the Second\r\nwith the state in which it had been when James the Second came to the\r\nthrone, it is impossible not to admit that a prodigious improvement had\r\ntaken place. We are no admirers of the political doctrines laid down in\r\nBlackstone’s Commentaries. But if we consider that those Commentaries\r\nwere read with great applause in the very schools where, seventy or\r\neighty years before, books had been publicly burned by order of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford for containing the damnable doctrine that the\r\nEnglish monarchy is limited and mixed, we cannot deny that a salutary\r\nchange had taken place. “The Jesuits,” says Pascal, in the last of\r\nhis incomparable letters, “have obtained a Papal decree, condemning\r\nGalileo’s doctrine about the motion of the earth. It is all in vain. If\r\nthe world is really turning round, all mankind together will not be able\r\nto keep it from turning, or to keep themselves from turning with it.”\r\n The decrees of Oxford were as ineffectual to stay the great moral and\r\npolitical revolution as those of the Vatican to stay the motion of our\r\nglobe. That learned University found itself not only unable to keep the\r\nmass from moving, but unable to keep itself from moving along with the\r\nmass. Nor was the effect of the discussions and speculations of that\r\nperiod confined to our own country. While the Jacobite party was in\r\nthe last dotage and weakness of its paralytic old age, the political\r\nphilosophy of England began to produce a mighty effect on France, and,\r\nthrough France, on Europe.\r\n\r\nHere another vast field opens itself before us. But {335}we must\r\nresolutely turn away from it. We will conclude by advising all our\r\nreaders to study Sir James Mackintosh’s valuable Fragment, and by\r\nexpressing our hope that they will soon be able to study it without\r\nthose accompaniments which have hitherto impeded its circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BACON. (1)\r\n\r\n(_Edinburgh Review_, July, 1837.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe {336}return our hearty thanks to Mr. Montagu for this truly valuable\r\nwork. From the opinions which he expresses as a biographer we often\r\ndissent. But about his merit as a collector of the materials out of\r\nwhich opinions are formed, there can be no dispute; and we readily\r\nacknowledge that we are in a great measure indebted to his minute\r\nand accurate researches for the means of refuting what we cannot but\r\nconsider as his errors.\r\n\r\nThe labour which has been bestowed on this volume has been a labour of\r\nlove. The writer is evidently enamoured of the subject. It fills his\r\nheart. It constantly overflows from his lips and his pen. Those who are\r\nacquainted with the Courts in which Mr. Montagu practises with so much\r\nability and success well know how often he enlivens the discussion of\r\na point of law by citing some weighty aphorism, or some brilliant\r\nillustration, from the _De Augmentis_ or the _Novum Organum_. The Life\r\nbefore us doubtless owes much of its value to the honest and generous\r\nenthusiasm of the writer. This feeling has stimulated his activity,\r\nhas sustained his perseverance, has called forth all his ingenuity and\r\neloquence: but, on the other\r\n\r\n     (1) _The Works of Francis Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England.\r\n     A new Edition_. By Basil Montagu, Esq., 16 vols. 8vo.\r\n     London: 1825-1834\r\n\r\n{337}hand, we must frankly say that it has, to a great extent, perverted\r\nhis judgment.\r\n\r\nWe are by no means without sympathy for Mr. Montagu even in what we\r\nconsider as his weakness. There is scarcely any delusion which has a\r\nbetter claim to be indulgently treated than that under the influence\r\nof which a man ascribes every moral excellence to those who have left\r\nimperishable monuments of their genius. The causes of this error lie\r\ndeep in the inmost recesses of human nature. We are all inclined to\r\njudge of others as we find them. Our estimate of a character always\r\ndepends much on the manner in which that character affects our own\r\ninterests and passions. We find it difficult to think well of those\r\nby whom we are thwarted or depressed; and we are ready to admit every\r\nexcuse for the vices of those who are useful or agreeable to us. This\r\nis, we believe, one of those illusions to which the whole human race is\r\nsubject, ana which experience and reflection can only partially remove.\r\nIt is, in the phraseology of Bacon, one of the _idolatribus_. Hence it\r\nis that the moral character of a man eminent in letters or in the fine\r\narts is treated, often by contemporaries, almost always by posterity,\r\nwith extraordinary tenderness. The world derives pleasure and advantage\r\nfrom the performances of such a man. The number of those who suffer by\r\nhis personal vices is small, even in his own time, when compared with\r\nthe number of those to whom his talents are a source of gratification.\r\nIn a few years all those whom he has injured disappear. But his works\r\nremain, and are a source of delight to millions. The genius of\r\nSallust is still with us. But the Numidians whom he plundered, and the\r\nunfortunate husbands who caught him in their houses at unseasonable\r\nhours, are forgotten. {338}We suffer ourselves to be delighted by the\r\nkeenness of Clarendon’s observation, and by the sober majesty of his\r\nstyle, till we forget the oppressor and the bigot in the historian.\r\nFalstaff and Tom Jones have survived the gamekeepers whom Shakspeare\r\ncudgelled and the landladies whom Fielding bilked. A great writer is the\r\nfriend and benefactor of his readers; and they cannot but judge of him\r\nunder the deluding influence of friendship and gratitude. We all know\r\nhow unwilling we are to admit the truth of any disgraceful story about\r\na person whose society we like, and from whom we have received favours:\r\nhow long we struggle against evidence, how fondly, when the facts cannot\r\nbe disputed, we cling to the hope that there may be some explanation or\r\nsome extenuating circumstance with which we are unacquainted. Just such\r\nis the feeling which a man of liberal education naturally entertains\r\ntowards the great minds of former ages. The debt which he owes to them\r\nis incalculable. They have guided him to truth. They have filled his\r\nmind with noble and graceful images. They have stood by him in all\r\nvicissitudes, comforters in sorrow, nurses in sickness, companions\r\nin solitude. These friendships are exposed to no danger from the\r\noccurrences by which other attachments are weakened or dissolved. Time\r\nglides on; fortune is inconstant; tempers are soured; bonds which\r\nseemed indissoluble are daily sundered by interest, by emulation, or by\r\ncaprice. But no such cause can affect the silent converse which we\r\nhold with the highest of human intellects. That placid intercourse is\r\ndisturbed by no jealousies or resentments. These are the old friends\r\nwho are never seen with new faces, who are the same in wealth and in\r\npoverty, in glory and in obscurity. With the dead there is no rivalry.\r\nIn the {339}dead there is no change. Plato is never sullen. Cervantes is\r\nnever petulant. Demosthenes never comes unseasonably. Dante never stays\r\ntoo long. No difference of political opinion can alienate Cicero. No\r\nheresy can excite the horror of Bossuet.\r\n\r\nNothing, then, can be more natural than that a person endowed\r\nwith sensibility and imagination should entertain a respectful and\r\naffectionate feeling towards those great men with whose minds he holds\r\ndaily communion. Yet nothing can be more certain than that such men\r\nhave not always deserved to be regarded with respect or affection. Some\r\nwriters, whose works will continue to instruct and delight mankind\r\nto the remotest ages, have been placed in such situations that their\r\nactions and motives are as well known to us as the actions and motives\r\nof one human being can be known to another; and unhappily their conduct\r\nhas not always been such as an impartial judge can contemplate with\r\napprobation. But the fanaticism of the devout worshipper of genius is\r\nproof against all evidence and all argument. The character of his idol\r\nis matter of faith; and the province of faith is not to be invaded by\r\nreason. He maintains his superstition with a credulity as boundless, and\r\na zeal as unscrupulous, as can be found in the most ardent partisans of\r\nreligious or political factions. The most decisive proofs are rejected;\r\nthe plainest rules of morality are explained away; extensive and\r\nimportant portions of history are completely distorted. The enthusiast\r\nmisrepresents facts with all the effrontery of an advocate, and\r\nconfounds right and wrong with all the dexterity of a Jesuit; and all\r\nthis only in order that some man who has been in his grave during many\r\nages may have a fairer character than he deserves. {340}Middleton’s\r\nLife of Cicero is a striking instance of the influence of this sort of\r\npartiality. Never was there a character which it was easier to read than\r\nthat of Cicero. Never was there a mind keener or more critical than\r\nthat of Middleton. Had the biographer brought to the examination of his\r\nfavourite statesman’s conduct but a very small part of the acuteness\r\nand severity which he displayed when he was engaged in investigating\r\nthe high pretensions of Epiphanius and Justin Martyr, he could not have\r\nfailed to produce a most valuable history of a most interesting portion\r\nof time. But this most ingenious and learned man, though,\r\n\r\n                        “So wary held and wise\r\n\r\n                   That, as ’twas said, he scarce received\r\n\r\n                   For gospel what the church believed,”\r\n\r\nhad a superstition of his own. The great Iconoclast was himself an\r\nidolater. The great _Avvocato del Diavolo_, while he disputed, with no\r\nsmall ability, the claims of Cyprian and Athanasius to a place in the\r\nCalendar, was himself composing a lying legend in honour of St. Tully.\r\nHe was holding up as a model of every virtue a man whose talents and\r\nacquirements, indeed, can never be too highly extolled, and who was by\r\nno means destitute of amiable qualities, but whose whole soul was under\r\nthe dominion of a girlish vanity and a craven fear. Actions for which\r\nCicero himself, the most eloquent and skilful of advocates, could\r\ncontrive no excuse, actions which in his confidential correspondence he\r\nmentioned with remorse and shame, are represented by his biographer as\r\nwise, virtuous, heroic. The whole history of that great revolution\r\nwhich overthrew the Roman aristocracy, the whole state of parties, the\r\ncharacter of every public man, is {341}elaborately misrepresented, in\r\norder to make out something which may look like a defence of one most\r\neloquent and accomplished trimmer.\r\n\r\nThe volume before us reminds us now and then of the Life of Cicero. But\r\nthere is this marked difference. Dr. Middleton evidently had an uneasy\r\nconsciousness of the weakness of his cause, and therefore resorted\r\nto the most disingenuous shifts, to unpardonable distortions and\r\nsuppression of facts. Mr. Montagu’s faith is sincere and implicit. He\r\npractises no trickery. He conceals nothing. He puts the facts before us\r\nin the full confidence that they will produce on our minds the effect\r\nwhich they have produced on his own. It is not till he comes to reason\r\nfrom facts to motives that his partiality shows itself; and then he\r\nleaves Middleton himself far behind. His work proceeds on the assumption\r\nthat Bacon was an eminently virtuous man. From the tree Mr. Montagu\r\njudges of the fruit. He is forced to relate many actions which, if\r\nany man but Bacon had committed them, nobody would have dreamed of\r\ndefending, actions which are readily and completely explained by\r\nsupposing Bacon to have been a man whose principles were not strict, and\r\nwhose spirit was not high, actions which can be explained in no other\r\nway without resorting to some grotesque hypothesis for which there\r\nis not a tittle of evidence. But any hypothesis is, in Mr. Montagu’s\r\nopinion, more probable than that his hero should ever have done any\r\nthing very wrong.\r\n\r\nThis mode of defending Bacon seems to us by no means Baconian. To take\r\na man’s character for granted, and then from his character to infer the\r\nmoral quality of all his actions, is surely a process the very reverse\r\nof that which is recommended in the _Novum {342}Organum_. Nothing, we\r\nare sure, could have led Mr. Montagu to depart so far from his master’s\r\nprecepts, except zeal for his master’s honour. We shall follow a\r\ndifferent course. We shall attempt, with the valuable assistance which\r\nMr. Montagu has afforded us, to frame such an account of Bacon’s life as\r\nmay enable our readers correctly to estimate his character.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that Francis Bacon was the son of Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon, who held the great seal of England during the first\r\ntwenty years of the reign of Elizabeth. The fame of the father has been\r\nthrown into shade by that of the son. But Sir Nicholas was no ordinary\r\nman. He belonged to a set of men whom it is easier to describe\r\ncollectively than separately, whose minds were formed by one system of\r\ndiscipline, who belonged to one rank in society, to one university, to\r\none party, to one sect, to one administration, and who resembled each\r\nother so much in talents, in opinions, in habits, in fortunes, that one\r\ncharacter, we had almost said one life, may, to a considerable extent,\r\nserve for them all.\r\n\r\nThey were the first generation of statesmen by profession that England\r\nproduced. Before their time the division of labour had, in this respect,\r\nbeen very imperfect. Those who had directed public affairs had been,\r\nwith few exceptions, warriors or priests; warriors whose rule courage\r\nwas neither guided by science nor softened by humanity, priests whose\r\nlearning and abilities were habitually devoted to the defence of\r\ntyranny and imposture. The Hotspurs, the Nevilles, the Cliffords, rough,\r\nilliterate, and unreflecting, brought to the council-board the fierce\r\nand imperious disposition which they had acquired amidst the tumult\r\nof predatory war, or in the gloomy repose of the garrisoned and moated\r\n{343}castle. On the other side was the calm and subtle prelate, versed\r\nin all that was then considered as learning, trained in the Schools\r\nto manage words, and in the confessional to manage hearts, seldom\r\nsuperstitious, but skilful in practising on the superstition of others,\r\nfalse, as it was natural that a man should be whose profession imposed\r\non all who were not saints the necessity of being hypocrites, selfish,\r\nas it was natural that a man should be who could form no domestic ties\r\nand cherish no hope of legitimate posterity, more attached to his order\r\nthan to his country, and guiding the politics of England with a constant\r\nside-glance at Rome.\r\n\r\nBut the increase of wealth, the progress of knowledge, and the\r\nreformation of religion produced a great change. The nobles ceased to\r\nbe military chieftains; the priests ceased to possess a monopoly of\r\nlearning; and a new and remarkable species of politicians appeared.\r\n\r\nThese men came from neither of the classes which had, till then, almost\r\nexclusively furnished ministers of state. They were all laymen; yet they\r\nwere all men of learning; and they were all men of peace. They were not\r\nmembers of the aristocracy. They inherited no titles, no large domains,\r\nno armies of retainers, no fortified castles. Yet they were not low men,\r\nsuch as those whom princes, jealous of the power of a nobility, have\r\nsometimes raised from forges and cobblers’ stalls to the highest\r\nsituations. They were all gentlemen by birth. They had all received a\r\nliberal education. It is a remarkable fact that they were all members of\r\nthe same university. The two great national seats of learning had even\r\nthen acquired the characters which they still retain. In intellectual\r\nactivity, and in readiness to admit improvements, the superiority\r\nwas then, as it has ever since been, on the side of the less ancient\r\n{344}and splendid institution. Cambridge had the honour of educating\r\nthose celebrated Protestant Bishops whom Oxford had the honour of\r\nburning; and at Cambridge were formed the minds of all those statesmen\r\nto whom chiefly is to be attributed the secure establishment of the\r\nreformed religion in the north of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe statesmen of whom we speak passed their youth surrounded by the\r\nincessant din of theological controversy. Opinions were still in a state\r\nof chaotic anarchy, intermingling, separating, advancing, receding.\r\nSometimes the stubborn bigotry of the Conservatives seemed likely to\r\nprevail. Then the impetuous onset of the Reformers for a moment carried\r\nall before it. Then again the resisting mass made a desperate stand,\r\narrested the movement, and forced it slowly back. The vacillation which\r\nat that time appeared in English legislation, and which it has been\r\nthe fashion to attribute to the caprice and to the power of one or two\r\nindividuals, was truly a national vacillation. It was not only in the\r\nmind of Henry that the new theology obtained the ascendant one day, and\r\nthat the lessons of the nurse and of the priest regained their influence\r\non the morrow. It was not only in the House of Tudor that the husband\r\nwas exasperated by the opposition of the wife, that the son dissented\r\nfrom the opinions of the father, that the brother persecuted the sister,\r\nthat one faster persecuted another. The principles of Conservation\r\nand Reform carried on their warfare in every part of society, in every\r\ncongregation, in every school of learning, round the hearth of every\r\nprivate family, in the recesses of every reflecting mind.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this ferment that the minds of the persons\r\nwhom we are describing were developed. They were born Reformers. They\r\nbelonged by nature {345}to that order of men who always form the front\r\nranks in the great intellectual progress. They were, therefore, one\r\nand all, Protestants. In religious matters, however, though there is no\r\nreason to doubt that they were sincere, they were by no means zealous.\r\nNone of them chose to run the smallest personal risk during the reign\r\nof Mary. None of them favoured the unhappy attempt of Northumberland\r\nin favour of his daughter-in-law. None of them shared in the desperate\r\ncouncils of Wyatt. They contrived to have business on the Continent;\r\nor, if they staid in England, they heard mass and kept Lent with great\r\ndecorum. When those dark and perilous years had gone by, and when\r\nthe crown had descended to a new sovereign, they took the lead in the\r\nreformation of the Church. But they proceeded, not with the impetuosity\r\nof theologians, but with the calm determination of statesmen. They\r\nacted, not like men who considered the Romish worship as a system too\r\noffensive to God, and too destructive of souls to be tolerated for an\r\nhour, but like men who regarded the points in dispute among Christians\r\nas in themselves unimportant, and who were not restrained by any\r\nscruple of conscience from professing, as they had before professed, the\r\nCatholic faith of Mary, the Protestant faith of Edward, or any of the\r\nnumerous intermediate combinations which the caprice of Henry and the\r\nservile policy of Cranmer had formed out of the doctrines of both the\r\nhostile parties. They took a deliberate view of the state of their\r\nown country and of the Continent: they satisfied themselves as to the\r\nleaning of the public mind; and they chose their side. They placed\r\nthemselves at the head of the Protestants of Europe, and staked all\r\ntheir fame and fortunes on the success of their party. {346}It is\r\nneedless to relate how dexterously, how resolutely, how gloriously\r\nthey directed the polities of England during the eventful years which\r\nfollowed, how they succeeded in uniting their friends and separating\r\ntheir enemies, how they humbled the pride of Philip, how they backed the\r\nunconquerable spirit of Coligni, how they rescued Holland from tyranny,\r\nhow they, founded the maritime greatness of their country, how they\r\noutwitted the artful politicians of Italy, and tamed the ferocious\r\nchieftains of Scotland. It is impossible to deny that they committed\r\nmany acts which would justly bring on a statesman of our time censures\r\nof the most serious kind. But, when we consider the state of morality\r\nin their age, and the unscrupulous character of the adversaries against\r\nwhom they had to contend, we are forced to admit that it is not\r\nwithout reason that their names are still held in veneration by their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThere were, doubtless, many diversities in their intellectual and moral\r\ncharacter. But there was a strong family likeness. The constitution of\r\ntheir minds was remarkably sound. No particular faculty was preeminently\r\ndeveloped; but manly health and vigour were equally diffused through\r\nthe whole. They were men of letters. Their minds were by nature and\r\nby exercise well fashioned for speculative pursuits. It was by\r\ncircumstances, rather than by any strong bias of inclination, that\r\nthey were led to take a prominent part in active life. In active life,\r\nhowever, no men could be more perfectly free from the faults of mere\r\ntheorists and pedants. No men observed more accurately the signs of the\r\ntimes. No men had a greater practical acquaintance with human nature.\r\nTheir policy was generally characterized {347}rather by vigilance, by\r\nmoderation, and by firmness, than by invention, or by the spirit of\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nThey spoke and wrote in a manner worthy of their excellent sense. Their\r\neloquence was less copious and less ingenious, but far purer and more\r\nmanly than that of the succeeding generation. It was the eloquence of\r\nmen who had lived with the first translators of the Bible, and with the\r\nauthors of the Book of Common Prayer. It was luminous, dignified, solid,\r\nand very slightly tainted with that affectation which deformed the\r\nstyle of the ablest men of the next age. If, as sometimes chanced, these\r\npoliticians were under the necessity of taking a part in the theological\r\ncontroversies on which the dearest interests of kingdoms were then\r\nstaked, they acquitted themselves as if their whole lives had been\r\npassed in the Schools and the Convocation.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the temper of these celebrated men which secured\r\nthem against the proverbial inconstancy both of the court and of the\r\nmultitude. No intrigue, no combination of rivals, could deprive them\r\nof the confidence of their Sovereign. No parliament attacked their\r\ninfluence. No mob coupled their names with any odious grievance. Their\r\npower ended only with their lives. In this respect, their fate presents\r\na most remarkable contrast to that of the enterprising and brilliant\r\npoliticians of the preceding and of the succeeding generation. Burleigh\r\nwas minister during forty years. Sir Nicholas Bacon held the great\r\nseal more than twenty years. Sir Walter Mildmay was Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer twenty-three years. Sir Thomas Smith was Secretary of State\r\neighteen years; Sir Francis Walsingham about as long. They all died in\r\noffice, and in the enjoyment of public respect {348}and royal favour.\r\nFar different had been the fate of Wolsey, Cromwell, Norfolk, Somerset,\r\nand Northumberland. Far different also was the fate of Essex, of\r\nRaleigh, and of the still more illustrious man whose life we propose to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this circumstance is perhaps contained in the motto\r\nwhich Sir Nicholas Bacon inscribed over the entrance of his hall at\r\nGorhambury, _Mediocria firma._\r\n\r\nThis maxim was constantly borne in mind by himself and his colleagues.\r\nThey were more solicitous to lay the foundations of their power deep\r\nthan to raise the structure to a conspicuous but insecure height. None\r\nof them aspired to be sole Minister. None of them provoked envy by an\r\nostentatious display of wealth and influence. None of them affected to\r\noutshine the ancient aristocracy of the kingdom. They were free\r\nfrom that childish love of titles which characterized the successful\r\ncourtiers of the generation which preceded them, and of that which\r\nfollowed them. Only one of those whom we have named was made a peer; and\r\nhe was content with the lowest degree of the peerage. As to money, none\r\nof them could, in that age, justly be considered as rapacious. Some\r\nof them would, even in our time, deserve the praise of eminent\r\ndisinterestedness. Their fidelity to the State was incorruptible. Their\r\nprivate morals were without stain. Their households were sober and\r\nwell-governed.\r\n\r\nAmong these statesmen Sir Nicholas Bacon was generally considered as\r\nranking next to Burleigh. He was called by Camden “Saeris conciliis\r\nalterum columen,” and by George Buchanan,\r\n\r\n                        “diu Britannici\r\n\r\n                   Regni secundum columen.”\r\n\r\n{349}The second wife of Sir Nicholas and mother of Francis Bacon was\r\nAnne, one of the daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, a man of distinguished\r\nlearning who had been tutor to Edward the Sixth. Sir Anthony had paid\r\nconsiderable attention to the education of his daughters, and lived\r\nto see them all splendidly and happily married. Their classical\r\nacquirements made them conspicuous even among the women of fashion of\r\nthat age. Katherine, who became Lady Killigrew, wrote Latin Hexameters\r\nand Pentameters which would appear with credit in the _Musae Etonenses_.\r\nMildred, the wife of Lord Burleigh, was described by Roger Ascham as\r\nthe best Greek scholar among the young women of England, Lady Jane Grey\r\nalways excepted. Anne, the mother of Francis Bacon, was distinguished\r\nboth as a linguist and as a theologian. She corresponded in Greek with\r\nBishop Jewel, and translated his _Apologia_ from the Latin, so correctly\r\nthat neither he nor Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration.\r\nShe also translated a series of sermons on fate and freewill from the\r\nTuscan of Bernardo Ochino. This fact is the more curious, because\r\nOchino was one of that small and audacious band of Italian reformers,\r\nanathematized alike by Wittenberg, by Geneva, by Zurich, and by Rome,\r\nfrom which the Socinian sect deduces its origin.\r\n\r\nLady Bacon was doubtless a lady of highly cultivated mind after the\r\nfashion of her age. But we must not suffer ourselves to be deluded into\r\nthe belief that she and her sisters were more accomplished women than\r\nmany who are now living. On this subject there is, we think, much\r\nmisapprehension. We have often heard men who wish, as almost all men of\r\nsense wish, that women should be highly educated, speak with rapture of\r\n{350}the English ladies of the sixteenth century, and lament that they\r\ncan find no modern damsel resembling those fair pupils of Ascham and\r\nAylmer who compared, over their embroidery, the styles of Isocrates and\r\nLysias, and who, while the horns were sounding and the dogs in full cry,\r\nsat in the lonely oriel, with eyes rivetted to that immortal page which\r\ntells how meekly and bravely the first great martyr of intellectual\r\nliberty took the cup from his weeping gaoler. But surely these\r\ncomplaints have very little foundation. We would by no means disparage\r\nthe ladies of the sixteenth century or their pursuits. But we conceive\r\nthat those who extol them at the expense of the women of our time forget\r\none very obvious and very important circumstance. In the time of Henry\r\nthe Eighth and Edward the Sixth, a person who did not read Greek and\r\nLatin could read nothing, or next to nothing. The Italian was the\r\nonly modern language which possessed any thing that could be called a\r\nliterature. All the valuable books then extant in all the vernacular\r\ndialects of Europe would hardly have filled a single shelf. England\r\ndid not yet possess Shakspeare’s plays and the Fairy Queen, nor\r\nFrance Montaigne’s Essays, nor Spain Don Quixote. In looking round a\r\nwell-furnished library, how many English or French books can we find\r\nwhich were extant when Lady Jane Grey and Queen Elizabeth received their\r\neducation? Chaucer, Gower, Froissart, Comines, Rabelais, nearly complete\r\nthe list. It was therefore absolutely necessary that a woman should be\r\nuneducated or classically educated. Indeed, without a knowledge of one\r\nof the ancient languages no person could then have any clear notion of\r\nwhat was passing in the political, the literary, or the religious world.\r\nThe Latin was in the sixteenth century all {351}and more than all that\r\nthe French was in the eighteenth. It was the language of courts as well\r\nas of the schools. It was the language of diplomacy; it was the language\r\nof theological and political controversy. Being a fixed language,\r\nwhile the living languages were in a state of fluctuation, and being\r\nuniversally known to the learned and the polite, it was employed by\r\nalmost every writer who aspired to a wide and durable reputation. A\r\nperson who was ignorant of it was shut out from all acquaintance,\r\nnot merely with Cicero and Virgil, not merely with heavy treatises on\r\ncanon-law and school-divinity, but with the most interesting memoirs,\r\nstate papers, and pamphlets of his own time, nay even with the most\r\nadmired poetry and the most popular squibs which appeared on the\r\nfleeting topics of the day, with Buchanan’s complimentary verses, with\r\nErasmus’s dialogues, with Hutten’s epistles.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer the case. All political and religious controversy is\r\nnow conducted in the modern languages. The ancient tongues are used only\r\nin comments on the ancient writers. The great productions of Athenian\r\nand Roman genius are indeed still what they were. But though their\r\npositive value is unchanged, their relative value, when compared\r\nwith the whole mass of mental wealth possessed by mankind, has been\r\nconstantly falling. They were the intellectual all of our ancestors.\r\nThey are but a part of our treasures. Over what tragedy could Lady Jane\r\nGrey have wept, over what comedy could she have smiled, if the ancient\r\ndramatists had not been in her library? A modern reader can make shift\r\nwithout Odipus and Medea, while he possesses Othello and Hamlet. If he\r\nknows nothing of Pyrgopolynices and Thraso, he is familiar with Bobadil,\r\nand Bessus, and Pistol, and {352}Parolles. If he cannot enjoy the\r\ndelicious irony of Plato, he may find some compensation in that of\r\nPascal. If he is shut out from Nephelococcygia, he may take refuge in\r\nLilliput. We are guilty, we hope, of no irreverence towards those great\r\nnations to which the human race owes art, science, taste, civil and\r\nintellectual freedom, when we say, that the stock bequeathed by them\r\nto us has been so carefully improved that the accumulated interest now\r\nexceeds the principal. We believe that the books which have been written\r\nin the languages of western Europe, during the last two hundred\r\nand fifty years,--translations from the ancient languages of course\r\nincluded,--are of greater value than all the books which at the\r\nbeginning of that period were extant in the world. With the modern\r\nlanguages of Europe English women are at least as well acquainted as\r\nEnglish men. When, therefore, we compare the acquirements of Lady Jane\r\nGrey with those of an accomplished young woman of our own time, we have\r\nno hesitation in awarding the superiority to the latter. We hope that\r\nour readers will pardon this digression. It is long; but it can hardly\r\nbe called unseasonable, if it tends to convince them that they are\r\nmistaken in thinking that the great-great-grandmothers of their\r\ngreat-great-grandmothers were superior women to their sisters and their\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon, the youngest son of Sir Nicholas, was born at York House,\r\nhis father’s residence in the Strand, on the twenty-second of January,\r\n1561. The health of Francis was very delicate; and to this circumstance\r\nmay be partly attributed that gravity of carriage, and that love of\r\nsedentary pursuits, which distinguished him from other boys. Every\r\nbody knows {353}how much his premature readiness of wit and sobriety of\r\ndeportment amused the Queen, and how she used to call him her young Lord\r\nKeeper. We are told that, while still a mere child, he stole away from\r\nhis playfellows to a vault in St. James’s Fields, for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating the cause of a singular echo which he had observed\r\nthere. It is certain that, at only twelve, he busied himself with very\r\ningenious speculations on the art of legerdemain; a subject which, as\r\nProfessor Dugald Stewart has most justly observed, merits much more\r\nattention from philosophers than it has ever received. These are\r\ntrifles. But the eminence which Bacon afterwards attained makes them\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth year of his age he was entered at Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. That celebrated school of learning enjoyed the peculiar\r\nfavour of the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Keeper, and acknowledged the\r\nadvantages which it derived from their patronage in a public letter\r\nwhich bears date just a month after the admission of Francis Bacon.\r\nThe master was Whitgift, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, a\r\nnarrowminded, mean, and tyrannical priest, who gained power by servility\r\nand adulation, and employed it in persecuting both those who agreed\r\nwith Calvin about Church Government, and those who differed from Calvin\r\ntouching the doctrine of Reprobation. He was now in a chrysalis\r\nstate, putting off the worm and putting on the dragon-fly, a kind of\r\nintermediate grub between sycophant and oppressor. He was indemnifying\r\nhimself for the court which he found it expedient to pay to the\r\nMinisters by exercising much petty tyranny within his own college. It\r\nwould be unjust, however, to deny him the praise of having rendered\r\nabout this time one important service to letters. He stood up manfully\r\n{354}against those who wished to make Trinity College a mere appendage\r\nto Westminster School; and by this act, the only good act, as far as\r\nwe remember, of his long public life, he saved the noblest place of\r\neducation in England from the degrading fate of King’s College and New\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that Bacon, while still at College, planned\r\nthat great intellectual revolution with which his name is inseparably\r\nconnected. The evidence on this subject, however, is hardly sufficient\r\nto prove what is in itself so improbable as that any definite scheme\r\nof that kind should have been so early formed, even by so powerful and\r\nactive a mind. But it is certain that, after a residence of three years\r\nat Cambridge, Bacon departed, carrying with him a profound contempt for\r\nthe course of study pursued there, a fixed conviction that the system\r\nof academic education in England was radically vicious, a just scorn for\r\nthe trifles on which the followers of Aristotle had wasted their powers,\r\nand no great reverence for Aristotle himself.\r\n\r\nIn his sixteenth year he visited Paris, and resided there for some time,\r\nunder the care of Sir Amias Paulet, Elizabeth’s minister at the French\r\ncourt, and one of the ablest and most upright of the many valuable\r\nservants whom she employed. France was at that time in a deplorable\r\nstate of agitation. The Huguenots and the Catholics were mustering\r\nall their force for the fiercest and most protracted of their many\r\nstruggles; while the Prince, whose duty it was to protect and to\r\nrestrain both, had by his vices and follies, degraded himself so deeply\r\nthat he had no authority over either. Bacon, however, made a tour\r\nthrough several provinces, and appears to have passed some time at\r\n{355}Poitiers. We have abundant proof that during his stay on the\r\nContinent he did not neglect literary and scientific pursuits. But\r\nhis attention seems to have been chiefly directed to statistics and\r\ndiplomacy. It was at this time that he wrote those Notes on the State of\r\nEurope which are printed in his works. He studied the principles of\r\nthe art of deciphering with great interest, and invented one cipher so\r\ningenious that, many years later, he thought it deserving of a place in\r\nthe _De Augmentis_. In February, 1580, while engaged in these pursuits,\r\nhe received intelligence of the almost sudden death of his father, and\r\ninstantly returned to England.\r\n\r\nHis prospects were greatly overcast by this event. He was most desirous\r\nto obtain a provision which might enable him to devote himself to\r\nliterature and politics. He applied to the Government; and it seems\r\nstrange that he should have applied in vain. His wishes were moderate.\r\nHis hereditary claims on the administration were great. He had himself\r\nbeen favourably noticed by the Queen. His uncle was Prime Minister. His\r\nown talents were such as any minister might have been eager to enlist in\r\nthe public service. But his solicitations were unsuccessful. The truth\r\nis that the Cecils disliked him, and did all that they could decently\r\ndo to keep him down. It has never been alleged that Bacon had done any\r\nthing to merit this dislike; nor is it at all probable that a man whose\r\ntemper was naturally mild, whose manners were courteous, who, through\r\nlife, nursed his fortunes with the utmost care, and who was fearful even\r\nto a fault of offending the powerful, would have given any just cause\r\nof displeasure to a kinsman who had the means of rendering him essential\r\nservice and of doing him irreparable injury. The real explanation,\r\n{356}we believe, is this. Robert Cecil, the Treasurer’s second son, was\r\nyounger by a few months than Bacon. He had been educated with the\r\nutmost care, had been initiated while still a boy, in the mysteries\r\nof diplomacy and court-intrigue, and was just at this time about to be\r\nproduced on the stage of public life. The wish nearest to Burleigh’s\r\nheart was that his own greatness might descend to this favourite child.\r\nBut even Burleigh’s fatherly partiality could hardly prevent him from\r\nperceiving that Robert, with all his abilities and acquirements, was\r\nno match for his cousin Francis. This seems to us the only rational\r\nexplanation of the Treasurer’s conduct. Mr. Montagu is more charitable.\r\nHe supposes that Burleigh was influenced merely by affection for his\r\nnephew, and was “little deposed to encourage him to rely on others\r\nrather than on himself, and to venture on the quicksands of politics,\r\ninstead of the certain profession of the law.” If such were Burleigh’s\r\nfeelings, it seems strange that he should have suffered his son to\r\nventure on those quicksands from which he so carefully preserved his\r\nnephew. But the truth is that, if Burleigh had been so disposed, he\r\nmight easily have secured to Bacon a comfortable provision which should\r\nhave been exposed to no risk. And it is certain that he showed as little\r\ndisposition to enable his nephew to live by a profession as to enable\r\nhim to live without a profession. That Bacon himself attributed the\r\nconduct of his relatives to jealousy of his superior talents, we\r\nhave not the smallest doubt. In a letter written many years later\r\nto Villiers, he expresses himself thus: “Countenance, encourage, and\r\nadvance able men in all kinds, degrees, and professions. For in the time\r\nof the Cecils, the father and the son, able men were by design and of\r\npurpose suppressed.” {357}Whatever Burleigh’s motives might be, his\r\npurpose was unalterable. The supplications which Francis addressed to\r\nhis uncle and aunt were earnest, humble, and almost servile. He was the\r\nmost promising and accomplished young man of his time. His father had\r\nbeen the brother-in-law, the most useful colleague, the nearest friend\r\nof the Minister. But all this availed poor Francis nothing. He was\r\nforced, much against his will, to betake himself to the study of the\r\nlaw. He was admitted at Gray’s Inn; and, during some years he laboured\r\nthere in obscurity.\r\n\r\nWhat the extent of his legal attainments may have been it is difficult\r\nto say. It was not hard for a man of his powers to acquire that very\r\nmoderate portion of technical knowledge which, when joined to quickness,\r\ntact, wit, ingenuity, eloquence, and knowledge of the world, is\r\nsufficient to raise an advocate to the highest professional eminence.\r\nThe general opinion appears to have been that which was on one occasion\r\nexpressed by Elizabeth. “Bacon,” said she, “hath a great wit and much\r\nlearning; but in law showeth to the uttermost of his knowledge, and is\r\nnot deep.” The Cecils, we suspect, did their best to spread this opinion\r\nby whispers and insinuations. Coke openly proclaimed it with that\r\nrancorous insolence which was habitual to him. No reports are more\r\nreadily believed than those which disparage genius, and soothe the envy\r\nof conscious mediocrity. It must have been inexpressibly consoling to\r\na stupid sergeant, the forerunner of him who, a hundred and fifty\r\nyears later, “shook his head at Murray as a wit,” to know that the most\r\nprofound thinker and the most accomplished orator of the age was very\r\nimperfectly acquainted with the law touching _bastardeigne_ and _mulier\r\npuisné_, and confounded {358}the right of free fishery with that of\r\ncommon of piscary.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that no man in that age, or indeed during the century\r\nand a half which followed, was better acquainted than Bacon with the\r\nphilosophy of law. His technical knowledge was quite sufficient, with\r\nthe help of his admirable talents and of his insinuating address,\r\nto procure clients. He rose very rapidly into business, and soon\r\nentertained hopes of being called within the bar. He applied to Lord\r\nBurleigh for that purpose, but received a testy refusal. Of the grounds\r\nof that refusal we can, in some measure, judge by Bacon’s answer, which\r\nis still extant. It seems that the old Lord, whose temper age and\r\ngout had by no means altered for the better, and who loved to mark his\r\ndislike of the showy, quick-witted young men of the rising generation,\r\ntook this opportunity to read Francis a very sharp lecture on his vanity\r\nand want of respect for his betters. Francis returned a most submissive\r\nreply, thanked the Treasurer for the admonition, and promised to profit\r\nby it. Strangers meanwhile were less unjust to the young barrister\r\nthan his nearest kinsman had been. In his twenty-sixth year he became a\r\nbencher of his Inn; and two years later he was appointed Lent reader. At\r\nlength in 1500, he obtained for the first time some show of favour from\r\nthe Court. He was sworn in Queen’s Counsel extraordinary. But this mark\r\nof honour was not accompanied by any pecuniary emolument. He continued,\r\ntherefore, to solicit his powerful relatives for some provision which\r\nmight enable him to live without drudging at his profession. He bore,\r\nwith a patience and serenity which, we fear, bordered on meanness, the\r\nmorose humours of his uncle, and the sneering reflections which {359}his\r\ncousin cast on speculative men, lost in philosophical dreams, and too\r\nwise to be capable of transacting public business. At length the\r\nCecils were generous enough to procure for him the reversion of the\r\nRegistrarship of the Star Chamber. This was a lucrative place; but, as\r\nmany years elapsed before it fell in, he was still under the necessity\r\nof labouring for his daily bread.\r\n\r\nIn the Parliament which was called in 1593 he sat as member for the\r\ncounty of Middlesex, and soon attained eminence as a debater. It is\r\neasy to perceive from the scanty remains of his oratory that the same\r\ncompactness of expression and richness of fancy which appear in his\r\nwritings characterized his speeches; and that his extensive acquaintance\r\nwith literature and history enabled him to entertain his audience with\r\na vast variety of illustrations and allusions which were generally happy\r\nand apposite, but which were probably not least pleasing to the taste\r\nof that age when they were such as would now be thought childish or\r\npedantic. It is evident also that he was, as indeed might have been\r\nexpected, perfectly free from those faults which are generally found in\r\nan advocate who, after having risen to eminence at the bar, enters\r\nthe House of Commons; that it was his habit to deal with every great\r\nquestion, not in small detached portions, but as a whole; that he\r\nrefined little, and that his reasonings were those of a capacious\r\nrather than a subtle mind. Ben Jonson, a most unexceptionable judge, has\r\ndescribed Bacon’s eloquence in words, which, though often quoted, will\r\nbear to be quoted again. “There happened in my time one noble speaker\r\nwho was full of gravity in his speaking. His language, where he could\r\nspare or pass by a jest, was nobly censorious. No man ever spoke more\r\nneatly, {360}more pressly, more weightily, or suffered less emptiness,\r\nless idleness, in what he uttered. No member of his speech but consisted\r\nof his own graces. His hearers could not cough or look aside from him\r\nwithout loss, he commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and\r\npleased at his devotion. No man had their affections more in his power.\r\nThe fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an end.”\r\n From the mention which is made of judges, it would seem that Jonson had\r\nheard Bacon only at the Bar. Indeed we imagine that the House of Commons\r\nwas then almost inaccessible to strangers. It is not probable that a\r\nman of Bacon’s nice observation would speak in Parliament exactly as\r\nhe spoke in the Court of Queen’s Bench. But the graces of manner and\r\nlanguage must, to a great extent, have been common between the Queen’s\r\nCounsel and the Knight of the Shire.\r\n\r\nBacon tried to play a very difficult game in politics. He wished to be\r\nat once a favourite at Court and popular with the multitude. If any\r\nman could have succeeded in this attempt, a man of talents so rare,\r\nof judgment so prematurely ripe, of temper so calm, and of manners so\r\nplausible, might have been expected to succeed. Nor indeed did he wholly\r\nfail. Once, however, he indulged in a burst of patriotism which cost him\r\na long and bitter remorse, and which he never ventured to repeat. The\r\nCourt asked for large subsidies and for speedy payment. The remains\r\nof Bacon’s speech breathe all the spirit of the Long Parliament. “The\r\ngentlemen,” said he, “must sell their plate, and the fanners their\r\nbrass pots, ere this will be paid; and for us, we are here to search\r\nthe wounds of the realm, and not to skim them over. The dangers {361}are\r\nthese. First, we shall breed discontent and endanger her Majesty’s\r\nsafety, which must consist more in the love of the people than their\r\nwealth. Secondly, this being granted in this sort, other princes\r\nhereafter will look for the like; so that we shall put an evil precedent\r\non ourselves and our posterity; and in histories, it is to be observed,\r\nof all nations the English are not to be subject, base, or taxable.” The\r\nQueen and her ministers resented this outbreak of public spirit in the\r\nhighest manner. Indeed, many an honest member of the House of Commons\r\nhad, for a much smaller matter, been sent to the Tower by the proud\r\nand hot-blooded Tudors. The young patriot condescended to make the most\r\nabject apologies. He adjured the Lord Treasurer to show some favour to\r\nhis poor servant and ally. He bemoaned himself to the Lord Keeper, in\r\na letter which may keep in countenance the most unmanly of the epistles\r\nwhich Cicero wrote during his banishment. The lesson was not thrown\r\naway. Bacon never offended in the same manner again.\r\n\r\nHe was now satisfied that he had little to hope from the patronage of\r\nthose powerful kinsmen whom he had solicited during twelve years with\r\nsuch meek pertinacity; and he began to look towards a different quarter.\r\nAmong the courtiers of Elizabeth had lately appeared a new favourite,\r\nyoung, noble, wealthy, accomplished, eloquent, brave, generous,\r\naspiring; a favourite who had obtained from the grey-headed Queen such\r\nmarks of regard as she had scarce vouchsafed to Leicester in the season\r\nof the passions; who was at once the ornament of the palace and the idol\r\nof the city; who was the common patron of men of letters and of men of\r\nthe sword; who was the common {362}refuge of the persecuted Catholic and\r\nof the persecuted Puritan. The calm prudence which had enabled Burleigh\r\nto shape his course through so many dangers, and the vast experience\r\nwhich he had acquired in dealing with two generations of colleagues\r\nand rivals, seemed scarcely sufficient to support him in this new\r\ncompetition; and Robert Cecil sickened with fear and envy as he\r\ncontemplated the rising fame and influence of Essex.\r\n\r\nThe history of the factions which, towards the close of the reign of\r\nElizabeth, divided her court and her council, though pregnant with\r\ninstruction, is by no means interesting or pleasing. Both parties\r\nemployed the means which are familiar to unscrupulous statesmen; and\r\nneither had, or even pretended to have, any important end in view. The\r\npublic mind was then reposing from one great effort, and collecting\r\nstrength for another. That impetuous and appalling rush with which the\r\nhuman intellect had moved forward in the career of truth and liberty,\r\nduring the fifty years which followed the separation of Luther from\r\nthe communion of the Church of Rome, was now over. The boundary between\r\nProtestantism and Popery had been fixed very nearly where it still\r\nremains. England, Scotland, the Northern kingdoms were on one side;\r\nIreland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, on the other. The line of demarcation\r\nran, as it still runs, through the midst of the Netherlands, of Germany,\r\nand of Switzerland, dividing province from province, electorate from\r\nelectorate, and canton from canton. France might be considered as a\r\ndebatable land, in which the contest was still undecided. Since that\r\ntime, the two religions have done little more than maintain their\r\nground. A few occasional incursions have been made. But the general\r\nfrontier remains {363}the same. During two hundred and fifty years no\r\ngreat society has risen up like one man, and emancipated itself by one\r\nmighty effort from the superstition of ages. This spectacle was common\r\nin the sixteenth century. Why has it ceased to be so? Why has so violent\r\na movement been followed by so long a repose? The doctrines of the\r\nReformers are not less agreeable to reason or to revelation now than\r\nformerly. The public mind is assuredly not less enlightened now than\r\nformerly. Why is it that Protestantism, after carrying every thing\r\nbefore it in a time of comparatively little knowledge and little\r\nfreedom, should make no perceptible progress in a reasoning and tolerant\r\nage; that the Luthers, the Calvins, the Knoxes, the Zwingles, should\r\nhave left no successors; that during two centuries and a half fewer\r\nconverts should have been brought over from the Church of Rome than at\r\nthe time of the Reformation were sometimes gained in a year? This has\r\nalways appeared to us one of the most curious and interesting problems\r\nin history. On some future occasion we may perhaps attempt to solve it.\r\nAt present it is enough to say that, at the close of Elizabeth’s reign,\r\nthe Protestant party, to borrow the language of the Apocalypse, had left\r\nits first love and had ceased to do its first works.\r\n\r\nThe great straggle of the sixteenth century was over. The great struggle\r\nof the seventeenth century had not commenced. The confessors of Mary’s\r\nreign were dead. The members of the Long Parliament were still in their\r\ncradles. The Papists had been deprived of all power in the state. The\r\nPuritans had not yet attained any formidable extent of power. True it is\r\nthat a student, well acquainted with the history of the next generation,\r\ncan easily discern in the proceedings {364}of the last Parliaments of\r\nElizabeth the germ of great and ever memorable events. But to the eye of\r\na contemporary nothing of this appeared. The two sections of ambitious\r\nmen who were struggling for power differed from each other on no\r\nimportant public question. Both belonged to the Established Church. Both\r\nprofessed boundless loyalty to the Queen. Both approved the war with\r\nSpain. There is not, so far as we are aware, any reason to believe that\r\nthey entertained different views concerning the succession of the Crown.\r\nCertainly neither faction had any great measure of reform in view.\r\nNeither attempted to redress any public grievance. The most odious and\r\npernicious grievance under which the nation then suffered was a source\r\nof profit to both, and was defended by both with equal zeal. Raleigh\r\nheld a monopoly of cards, Essex a monopoly of sweet wines. In fact, the\r\nonly ground of quarrel between the parties was that they could not agree\r\nas to their respective shares of power and patronage.\r\n\r\nNothing in the political conduct of Essex entitles him to esteem; and\r\nthe pity with which we regard his early and terrible end is diminished\r\nby the consideration, that he put to hazard the lives and fortunes of\r\nhis most attached friends, and endeavoured to throw the whole country\r\ninto confusion, for objects purely personal. Still, it is impossible not\r\nto be deeply interested for a man so brave, high-spirited, and generous;\r\nfor a man who, while he conducted himself towards his sovereign with a\r\nboldness such as was then found in no other subject, conducted himself\r\ntowards his dependents with a delicacy such as has rarely been found in\r\nany other patron. Unlike the vulgar herd of benefactors, he desired to\r\ninspire, not gratitude, but affection. He {365}tried to make those whom\r\nhe befriended feel towards him as towards an equal. His mind, ardent,\r\nsusceptible, naturally disposed to admiration of all that is great and\r\nbeautiful, was fascinated by the genius and accomplishments of Bacon. A\r\nclose friendship was soon formed between them, a friendship destined to\r\nhave a dark, a mournful, a shameful end.\r\n\r\nIn 1504 the office of Attorney-General became vacant, and Bacon hoped\r\nto obtain it. Essex made his friend’s cause his own, sued, expostulated,\r\npromised, threatened, but all in vain. It is probable that the dislike\r\nfelt by the Cecils for Bacon had been increased by the connection which\r\nhe had lately formed with the Earl. Robert was then on the point of\r\nbeing made Secretary of State. He happened one day to be in the same\r\ncoach with Essex, and a remarkable conversation took place between them.\r\n“My Lord,” said Sir Robert, “the Queen has determined to appoint an\r\nAttorney-General without more delay. I pray your Lordship to let me know\r\nwhom you will favour.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder at your question,” replied the Earl. “You cannot but know\r\nthat resolutely, against all the world, I stand for your cousin, Francis\r\nBacon.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” cried Cecil, unable to bridle his temper, “I wonder your\r\nLordship should spend your strength on so unlikely a matter. Can you\r\nname one precedent of so raw a youth promoted to so great a place?”\r\n This objection came with a singularly bad grace from a man who, though\r\nyounger than Bacon, was in daily expectation of being made Secretary\r\nof State. The blot was too obvious to be missed by Essex, who seldom\r\nforbore to speak his mind. “I have made no search,” said he, “for\r\nprecedents of young men who have filled the office of Attorney-General.\r\nBut I could name to you, {366}Sir Robert, a man younger than Francis,\r\nless learned, and equally inexperienced, who is suing and striving\r\nwith all his might for an office of far greater weight.” Sir Robert had\r\nnothing to say but that he thought his own abilities equal to the place\r\nwhich he hoped to obtain, and that his father’s long services deserved\r\nsuch a mark of gratitude from the Queen; as if his abilities were\r\ncomparable to his cousin’s, or as if Sir Nicholas Bacon had done\r\nno service to the State. Cecil then hinted that, if Bacon would be\r\nsatisfied with the Solicitorship, that might be of easier digestion to\r\nthe Queen. “Digest me no digestions,” said the generous and ardent Earl.\r\n“The Attorneyship for Francis is that I must have; and in that I will\r\nspend all my power, might, authority, and amity; and with tooth and nail\r\nprocure the same for him against whomsoever; and whosoever getteth this\r\noffice out of my hands for any other, before he have it, it shall cost\r\nhim the coming by. And this be you assured of, Sir Robert, for now I\r\nfully declare myself; and for my own part, Sir Robert, I think strange\r\nboth of my Lord Treasurer and you, that can have the mind to seek the\r\npreference of a stranger before so near a kinsman; for if you weigh in\r\na balance the parts every way of his competitor and him, only excepting\r\nfive poor years of admitting to a house of court before Francis, you\r\nshall find in all other respects whatsoever no comparison between them.”\r\n\r\nWhen the office of Attorney-General was filled up the Earl pressed the\r\nQueen to make Bacon Solicitor-General, and, on this occasion, the\r\nold Lord Treasurer professed himself not unfavourable to his nephew’s\r\npretensions. But, after a contest which lasted more than a year and\r\na half, and in which Essex, to use his own {367}words, “spent all his\r\npower, might, authority, and amity,” the place was given to another.\r\nEssex felt this disappointment keenly, but found consolation in the most\r\nmunificent and delicate liberality. He presented Bacon with an estate\r\nworth near two thousand pounds, situated at Twickenham; and this, as\r\nBacon owned many years after, “with so kind and noble circumstances as\r\nthe manner was worth more than the matter.”\r\n\r\nIt was soon after these events that Bacon first appeared before the\r\npublic as a writer. Early in 1597 he published a small volume of Essays,\r\nwhich was afterwards enlarged by successive additions to many times\r\nits original bulk. This little work was, as it well deserved to be,\r\nexceedingly popular. It was reprinted in a few months; it was\r\ntranslated into Latin, French, and Italian; and it seems to have at once\r\nestablished the literary reputation of its author. But, though Bacon’s\r\nreputation rose, his fortunes were still depressed. He was in great\r\npecuniary difficulties; and on one occasion, was arrested in the street\r\nat the suit of a goldsmith for a debt of three hundred pounds, and was\r\ncarried to a spunging-house in Coleman Street.\r\n\r\nThe kindness of Essex was in the mean time indefatigable. In 1596 he\r\nsailed on his memorable expedition to the coast of Spain. At the\r\nvery moment of his embarkation, he wrote to several of his friends,\r\ncommending to them, during his own absence, the interests of Bacon. He\r\nreturned, after performing the most brilliant military exploit that was\r\nachieved on the Continent by English arms during the long interval\r\nwhich elapsed between the battle of Agincourt and that of Blenheim. His\r\nvalour, his talents, his humane and generous disposition, had made\r\nhim the idol of his {368}countrymen, and had extorted praise from\r\nthe enemies whom he had conquered. (1) He had always been proud and\r\nheadstrong; and his splendid success seems to have rendered his faults\r\nmore offensive than ever. But to his friend Francis he was still the\r\nsame. Bacon had some thoughts of making his fortune by marriage, and\r\nhad begun to pay court to a widow of the name of Hatton. The eccentric\r\nmanners and violent temper of this woman made her a disgrace and a\r\ntorment to her connections. But Bacon was not aware of her faults, or\r\nwas disposed to overlook them for the sake of her ample fortune. Essex\r\npleaded his friend’s cause with his usual ardour. The letters which the\r\nEarl addressed to Lady Hatton and to her mother are still extant, and\r\nare highly honourable to him. “If,” he wrote, “she were my sister or my\r\ndaughter, I protest I would as confidently resolve to further it as I\r\nnow persuade you;” and again, “if my faith be any thing, I protest, if\r\nI had one as near me as she is to you, I had rather match her with him,\r\nthan with men of far greater titles.” The suit, happily for Bacon, was\r\nunsuccessful. The lady indeed was kind to him in more ways than one.\r\nShe rejected him; and she accepted his enemy. She married that\r\nnarrow-minded, bad-hearted pedant, Sir Edward Coke, and did her best to\r\nmake him as miserable as he deserved to be.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of Essex had now reached their height, and began to\r\ndecline. He possessed indeed all the qualities which raise men to\r\ngreatness rapidly. But he had neither the virtues or the vices which\r\nenable men to retain greatness long. His frankness, his keen sensibility\r\nto insult and injustice were by no means\r\n\r\n     (1) See Cervantes’s _Novela de la Espanola Inglesa_.\r\n\r\n{369}agreeable to a sovereign natural impatient of opposition, and\r\naccustomed, during forty years, to the most extravagant flattery and the\r\nmost abject submission. The daring and contemptuous manner in which\r\nhe bade defiance to his enemies excited their deadly hatred. His\r\nadministration in Ireland was unfortunate, and in many respects highly\r\nblamable. Though his brilliant courage and his impetuous activity fitted\r\nhim admirably for such enterprises as that of Cadiz, he did not possess\r\nthe caution, patience, and resolution necessary for the conduct of a\r\nprotracted war, in which difficulties were to be gradually surmounted,\r\nin which much discomfort was to be endured, and in which few splendid\r\nexploits could be achieved. For the civil duties of his high place he\r\nwas still less qualified. Though eloquent and accomplished, he was in no\r\nsense a statesman. The multitude indeed still continued to regard even\r\nhis faults with fondness. But the Court had ceased to give him credit,\r\neven for the merit which he really possessed. The person on whom, during\r\nthe decline of his influence, he chiefly depended, to whom he confided\r\nhis perplexities, whose advice he solicited, whose intercession he\r\nemployed, was his friend Bacon. The lamentable truth must be told. This\r\nfriend, so loved, so trusted, bore a principal part in mining the Earl’s\r\nfortunes, in shedding his blood, and in blackening his memory.\r\n\r\nBut let us be just to Bacon. We believe that, to the last, he had no\r\nwish to injure Essex. Nay, we believe that he sincerely exerted himself\r\nto serve Essex, as long as he thought he could serve Essex without\r\ninjuring himself. The advice which he gave to his noble benefactor was\r\ngenerally most judicious. He did all in his power to dissuade the Earl\r\nfrom accepting the Government of Ireland. “For,” says he, {370}“I did as\r\nplainly see his overthrow chained as it were by destiny to that\r\njourney, as it is possible for a man to ground a judgment upon future\r\ncontingents.” The prediction was accomplished. Essex returned in\r\ndisgrace. Bacon attempted to mediate between his friend and the Queen;\r\nand, we believe, honestly employed all his address for that purpose.\r\nBut the task which he had undertaken was too difficult, delicate, and\r\nperilous, even for so wary and dexterous an agent. He had to manage two\r\nspirits equally proud, resentful, and ungovernable. At Essex House, he\r\nhad to calm the rage of a young hero incensed by multiplied wrongs and\r\nhumiliations, and then to pass to Whitehall for the purpose of soothing\r\nthe peevishness of a sovereign, whose temper, never very gentle, had\r\nbeen rendered morbidly irritable by age, by declining health, and by the\r\nlong habit of listening to flattery and exacting implicit obedience.\r\nIt is hard to serve two masters. Situated as Bacon was, it was scarcely\r\npossible for him to shape his course so as not to give one or both of\r\nhis employers reason to complain. For a time he acted as fairly as, in\r\ncircumstances so embarrassing, could reasonably be expected. At length\r\nhe found that, while he was trying to prop the fortunes of another, he\r\nwas in danger of shaking his own. He had disobliged both the parties\r\nwhom he wished to reconcile. Essex thought him wanting in zeal as a\r\nfriend: Elizabeth thought him wanting in duty as a subject. The Earl\r\nlooked on him as a spy of the Queen; the Queen as a creature of the\r\nEarl. The reconciliation which he had laboured to effect appeared\r\nutterly hopeless. A thousand signs, legible to eyes far less keen than\r\nhis, announced that the fall of his patron was at hand. He shaped his\r\ncourse accordingly. When Essex was {371}brought before the council\r\nto answer for his conduct in Ireland, Bacon, after a faint attempt to\r\nexcuse himself from taking part against his friend, submitted himself’\r\nto the Queen’s pleasure, and appeared at the bar in support of the\r\ncharges. But a darker scene was behind. The unhappy young nobleman, made\r\nreckless by despair, ventured on a rash and criminal enterprise, which\r\nrendered him liable to the highest penalties of the law. What course was\r\nBacon to take? This was one of those conjunctures which show what men\r\nare. To a high-minded man, wealth, power, court-favor, even personal\r\nsafety, would have appeared of no account, when opposed to friendship,\r\ngratitude, and honour. Such a man would have stood by the side of Essex\r\nat the trial, would have “spent all his power, might, authority, and\r\namity” in soliciting a mitigation of the sentence, would have been a\r\ndaily visitor at the cell, would have received the last injunctions and\r\nthe last embrace on the scaffold, would have employed all the powers\r\nof his intellect to guard from insult the fame of his generous though\r\nerring friend. An ordinary man would neither have incurred the danger of\r\nsuccouring Essex, nor the disgrace of assailing him. Bacon did not even\r\npreserve neutrality. He appeared as counsel for the prosecution. In\r\nthat situation he did not confine himself to what would have been amply\r\nsufficient to procure a verdict. He employed all his wit, his rhetoric,\r\nand his learning, not to insure a conviction,--for the circumstances\r\nwere such that a conviction was inevitable,--but to deprive the unhappy\r\nprisoner of all those excuses which, though legally of no value, yet\r\ntended to diminish the moral guilt of the crime, and which, therefore,\r\nthough they could not justify the peers in pronouncing an acquittal,\r\nmight {372}incline the Queen to grant a pardon. The Earl urged as a\r\npalliation of his frantic acts that he was surrounded by powerful and\r\ninveterate enemies, that they had ruined his fortunes, that they sought\r\nhis life, and that their persecutions had driven him to despair. This\r\nwas true; and Bacon well knew it to be true. But he affected to treat it\r\nas an idle pretence. He compared Essex to Pisistratus who, by\r\npretending to be in imminent danger of assassination, and by exhibiting\r\nself-inflicted wounds, succeeded in establishing tyranny at Athens. This\r\nwas too much for the prisoner to bear. He interrupted his ungrateful\r\nfriend by calling on him to quit the part of an advocate, to come\r\nforward as a witness, and to tell the Lords whether, in old times, he\r\nFrancis Bacon, had not under his own hand, repeatedly asserted the truth\r\nof what he now represented as idle pretexts. It is painful to go on with\r\nthis lamentable story. Bacon returned a shuffling answer to the Earl’s\r\nquestion, and, as if the allusion to Pisistratus were not sufficiently\r\noffensive, made another allusion still more unjustifiable. He compared\r\nEssex to Henry Duke of Guise, and the rash attempt in the city to the\r\nday of the barricades at Paris. Why Bacon had recourse to such a topic\r\nit is difficult to say. It was quite unnecessary for the purpose of\r\nobtaining a verdict. It was certain to produce a strong impression\r\non the mind of the haughty and jealous princess on whose pleasure the\r\nEarl’s fate depended. The faintest allusion to the degrading tutelage\r\nin which the last Valois had been held by the House of Lorraine was\r\nsufficient to harden her heart against a man who in rank, in military\r\nreputation, in popularity among the citizens of the capital, bore some\r\nresemblance to the Captain of the League.\r\n\r\n{373}Essex was convicted. Bacon made no effort to save him, though the\r\nQueen’s feelings were such that he might have pleaded his benefactor’s\r\ncause, possibly with success, certainly without any serious danger to\r\nhimself. The unhappy nobleman was executed. His fate excited strong,\r\nperhaps unreasonable feelings of compassion and indignation. The Queen\r\nwas received by the citizens of London with gloomy looks and faint\r\nacclamations. She thought it expedient to publish a vindication of her\r\nlate proceedings. The faithless friend who had assisted in taking the\r\nEarl’s life was now employed to murder the Earl’s fame. The Queen had\r\nseen some of Bacon’s writings, and had been pleased with them. He\r\nwas accordingly selected to write “A Declaration of the Practices and\r\nTreasons attempted and committed by Robert Earl of Essex,” which was\r\nprinted by authority. In the succeeding reign, Bacon had not a word\r\nto say in defence of this performance, a performance abounding in\r\nexpressions which no generous enemy would have employed respecting a man\r\nwho had so dearly expiated his offences. His only excuse was, that he\r\nwrote it by command, that he considered himself as a mere secretary,\r\nthat he had particular instructions as to the way in which he was to\r\ntreat every part of the subject, and that, in fact, he had furnished\r\nonly the arrangement and the style.\r\n\r\nWe regret to say that the whole conduct of Bacon through the course\r\nof these transactions appears to Mr. Montagu not merely excusable, but\r\ndeserving of high admiration. The integrity and benevolence of this\r\ngentleman are so well known that our readers will probably be at a loss\r\nto conceive by what steps he can have arrived at so extraordinary\r\na conclusion: and we are half afraid that they will suspect us of\r\npractising {374}some artifice upon them when we report the principal\r\narguments which he employs.\r\n\r\nIn order to get rid of the charge of ingratitude, Mr. Montagu attempts\r\nto show that Bacon lay under greater obligations to the Queen than\r\nto Essex. What these obligations were it is not easy to discover.\r\nThe situation of Queen’s Counsel, and a remote reversion, were surely\r\nfavours very far below Bacon’s personal and hereditary claims. They were\r\nfavours which had not cost the Queen a groat, nor had they put a groat\r\ninto Bacon’s purse. It was necessary to rest Elizabeth’s claims to\r\ngratitude on some other ground; and this Mr. Montagu felt. “What perhaps\r\nwas her greatest kindness,” says he, “instead of having hastily advanced\r\nBacon, she had, with a continuance of her friendship, made him bear the\r\nyoke in his youth. Such were his obligations to Elizabeth.” Such\r\nindeed they were. Being the son of one of her oldest and most faithful\r\nministers, being himself the ablest and most accomplished young man of\r\nhis time, he had been condemned by her to drudgery, to obscurity, to\r\npoverty. She had depreciated his acquirements. She had checked him in\r\nthe most imperious manner, when in Parliament he ventured to act an\r\nindependent part. She had refused to him the professional advancement to\r\nwhich he had a just claim. To her it was owing that, while younger men,\r\nnot superior to him in extraction, and far inferior to him in every kind\r\nof personal merit, were filling the highest offices of the state,\r\nadding manor to manor, rearing palace after palace, he was lying at a\r\nspunging-house for a debt of three hundred pounds. Assuredly if Bacon\r\nowed gratitude to Elizabeth, he owed none to Essex. If the Queen really\r\nwas his best friend, the Earl was his worst enemy. {375}We wonder that\r\nMr. Montagu did not press this argument a little further. He might have\r\nmaintained that Bacon was excusable in revenging himself on a man who\r\nhad attempted to rescue his youth from the salutary yoke imposed on it\r\nby the Queen, who had wished to advance him hastily, who, not content\r\nwith attempting to inflict the Attorney-Generalship upon him, had been\r\nso cruel as to present him with a landed estate.\r\n\r\nAgain, we can hardly think Mr. Montagu serious when he tells us that\r\nBacon was bound for the sake of the public not to destroy his own hopes\r\nof advancement, and that he took part against Essex from a wish to\r\nobtain power which might enable him to be useful to his country. We\r\nreally do not know how to refute such arguments except by stating them.\r\nNothing is impossible which does not involve a contradiction. It is\r\nbarely possible that Bacon’s motives for acting as he did on this\r\noccasion may have been gratitude to the Queen for keeping him poor, and\r\na desire to benefit his fellow-creatures in some high situation. And\r\nthere is a possibility that Bonner may have been a good Protestant who,\r\nbeing convinced that the blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church,\r\nheroically went through all the drudgery and infamy of persecution,\r\nin order that he might inspire the English people with an intense and\r\nlasting hatred of Popery. There is a possibility that Jeffreys may have\r\nbeen an ardent lover of liberty, and that he may have beheaded Algernon\r\nSydney, and burned Elizabeth Gaunt, only in order to produce a reaction\r\nwhich might lead to the limitation of the prerogative. There is a\r\npossibility that Thurtell may have killed Weare only in order to give\r\nthe youth of England an impressive warning against gaming and {376}bad\r\ncompany. There is a possibility that Fauntleroy may have forged powers\r\nof attorney, only in order that his fate might turn the attention of\r\nthe public to the defects of the penal law. These things, we say, are\r\npossible. But they are so extravagantly improbable that a man who should\r\nact on such suppositions would be fit only for Saint Luke’s. And we do\r\nnot see why suppositions on which no rational man would act in ordinary\r\nlife should be admitted into history.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu’s notion that Bacon desired power only in order to do good\r\nto mankind appears somewhat strange to us, when we consider how Bacon\r\nafterwards used power, and how he lost it. Surely the service which he\r\nrendered to mankind by taking Lady Wharton’s broad pieces and Sir John\r\nKennedy’s cabinet was not of such vast importance as to sanctify all the\r\nmeans which might conduce to that end. If the case were fairly stated,\r\nit would, we much fear, stand thus: Bacon was a servile advocate, that\r\nhe might be a corrupt judge.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu maintains that none but the ignorant and unreflecting can\r\nthink Bacon censurable for any thing that he did as counsel for the\r\nCrown, and that no advocate can justifiably use any discretion as to the\r\nparty for whom he appears. We will not at present inquire whether the\r\ndoctrine which is held on this subject by English lawyers be or be not\r\nagreeable to reason and morality; whether it be right that a man should,\r\nwith a wig on his head, and a band round his neck, do for a guinea what,\r\nwithout those appendages, he would think it wicked and infamous to\r\ndo for an empire; whether it be right that, not merely believing but\r\nknowing a statement to be true, he should do all that can be done\r\nby sophistry, by rhetoric, by solemn {377}asseveration, by indignant\r\nexclamation, by gesture, by play of features, by terrifying one honest\r\nwitness, by perplexing another, to cause a jury to think that statement\r\nfalse. It is not necessary on the present occasion to decide these\r\nquestions. The professional rules, be they good or bad, are rules\r\nto which many wise and virtuous men have conformed, and are daily\r\nconforming. If, therefore, Bacon did no more than these rules required\r\nof him, we shall readily admit that he was blameless, or, at least,\r\nexcusable. But we conceive that his con duct was not justifiable\r\naccording to any professional rules that now exist, or that ever existed\r\nin England. It has always been held that, in criminal cases in which\r\nthe prisoner was denied the help of counsel, and, above all, in capital\r\ncases, advocates were both entitled and bound to exercise a discretion.\r\nIt is true that, after the Revolution, when the Parliament began to\r\nmake inquisition for the innocent blood which had been shed by the last\r\nStuarts, a feeble attempt was made to defend the lawyers who had been\r\naccomplices in the murder of Sir Thomas Armstrong, on the ground that\r\nthey had only acted professionally. The wretched sophism was silenced\r\nby the execrations of the House of Commons. “Things will never be well\r\ndone,” said Mr. Foley, “till some of that profession be made examples.”\r\n\r\n“We have a new sort of monsters in the world,” said the younger Hampden,\r\n“haranguing a man to death. These I call bloodhounds. Sawyer is very\r\ncriminal and guilty of this murder.”\r\n\r\n“I speak to discharge my conscience,” said Mr. Garroway. “I will not\r\nhave the blood of this man at my door. Sawyer demanded judgment against\r\nhim and execution. I believe him guilty of the death {378}of this man.\r\nDo what you will with him.”\r\n\r\n“If the profession of the law,” said the elder Hampden, “gives a man\r\nauthority to murder at this rate, it is the interest of all men to rise\r\nand exterminate that profession.” Nor was this language held only by\r\nunlearned country gentlemen. Sir William Williams, one of the ablest and\r\nmost unscrupulous lawyers of the age, took the same view of the case.\r\nHe had not hesitated, he said, to take part in the prosecution of the\r\nBishops, because they were allowed counsel. But he maintained that,\r\nwhere the prisoner was not allowed counsel, the Counsel for the Crown\r\nwas bound to exercise a discretion, and that every lawyer who neglected\r\nthis distinction was a betrayer of the law. But it is unnecessary to\r\ncite authority. It is known to every body who has ever looked into\r\na court of quarter-sessions that lawyers do exercise a discretion in\r\ncriminal cases; and it is plain to every man of common sense that, if\r\nthey did not exercise such a discretion, they would be a more hateful\r\nbody of men than those bravoes who used to hire out their stilettoes in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nBacon appeared against a man who was indeed guilty of a great offence,\r\nbut who had been his benefactor and friend. He did more than this.\r\nNay, he did more than a person who had never seen Essex would have been\r\njustified in doing. He employed all the art of an advocate in order to\r\nmake the prisoner’s conduct appear more inexcusable and more dangerous\r\nto the state than it really had been. All that professional duty could,\r\nin any case, have required of him would have been to conduct the cause\r\nso as to insure a conviction. But from the nature of the circumstances\r\nthere could not be the smallest doubt that the Earl would be found\r\nguilty. The character of the {379}crime was unequivocal. It had been\r\ncommitted recently, in broad daylight, in the streets of the capital,\r\nin the presence of thousands. If ever there was an occasion on which\r\nan advocate had no temptation to resort to extraneous topics, for\r\nthe purpose of blinding the judgment and inflaming the passions of a\r\ntribunal, this was that occasion. Why then resort to arguments which,\r\nwhile they could add nothing to the strength of the case, considered in\r\na legal point of view, tended to aggravate the moral guilt of the fatal\r\nenterprise, and to excite fear and resentment in that quarter from which\r\nalone the Earl could now expect mercy? Why remind the audience of the\r\narts of the ancient tyrants? Why deny, what every body knew to be the\r\ntruth, that a powerful faction at court had long sought to effect the\r\nruin of the prisoner? Why, above all, institute a parallel between the\r\nunhappy culprit and the most wicked and most successful rebel of the\r\nage? Was it absolutely impossible to do all that professional duty\r\nrequired without reminding a jealous sovereign of the League, of the\r\nbarricades, and of all the humiliations which a too powerful subject had\r\nheaped on Henry the Third?\r\n\r\nBut if we admit the plea which Mr. Montagu urges in defence of what\r\nBacon did as an advocate, what shall we say of the “Declaration of the\r\nTreasons of Robert Earl of Essex?” Here at least there was no pretence\r\nof professional obligation. Even those who may think it the duty of\r\na lawyer to hang, draw, and quarter his benefactors, for a proper\r\nconsideration, will hardly say that it is his duty to write abusive\r\npamphlets against them, after they are in their graves. Bacon excused\r\nhimself by saying that he was not answerable for the matter of the book,\r\nand that he furnished only {380}the language. But why did lie endow such\r\npurposes with words? Could no hack writer, without virtue or shame, be\r\nfound to exaggerate the errors, already so dearly expiated, of a gentle\r\nand noble spirit? Every age produces those links between the man and the\r\nbaboon. Every age is fertile of Oldmixons, of Kenricks, and of Antony\r\nPasquins. But was it for Bacon so to prostitute his intellect? Could he\r\nnot feel that, while he rounded and pointed some period dictated by the\r\nenvy of Cecil, or gave a plausible form to some slander invented by the\r\ndastardly malignity of Cobliam, he was not sinning merely against his\r\nfriend’s honour and his own? Could he not feel that letters, eloquence,\r\nphilosophy, were all degraded in his degradation?\r\n\r\nThe real explanation of all this is perfectly obvious; and nothing but\r\na partiality amounting to a ruling passion could cause any body to miss\r\nit. The moral qualities of Bacon were not of a high order. We do not say\r\nthat he was a bad man. He was not inhuman or tyrannical. He bore with\r\nmeekness his high civil honours, and the far higher honours gained by\r\nhis intellect. He was very seldom, if ever, provoked into treating any\r\nperson with malignity and insolence. Ko man more readily held up the\r\nleft cheek to those who had smitten the right. No man was more expert at\r\nthe soft answer which turneth away wrath. He was never charged, by any\r\naccuser entitled to the smallest credit, with licentious habits. His\r\neven temper, his flowing courtesy, the general respectability of\r\nhis demeanour, made a favourable impression on those who saw him in\r\nsituations which do not severely try the principles. His faults were--we\r\nwrite it with pain--coldness of heart, and meanness of spirit. He seems\r\nto have been incapable of feeling strong affection, of {381}facing great\r\ndangers, of making great sacrifices. His desires were set on things\r\nbelow. Wealth, precedence, titles, patronage, the mace, the seals, the\r\ncoronet, large houses, fair gardens, rich manors, massive services of\r\nplate, gay hangings, curious cabinets, had as great attractions for him\r\nas for any of the courtiers who dropped on their knees in the dirt when\r\nElizabeth passed by, and then hastened home to write to the King of\r\nScots that her Grace seemed to be breaking fast. For these objects he\r\nhad stooped to every thing and endured every thing. For these he\r\nhad sued in the humblest manner, and, when unjustly and ungraciously\r\nrepulsed, had thanked those who had repulsed him, and had begun to sue\r\nagain. For these objects, as soon as he found that the smallest show\r\nof independence in Parliament was offensive to the Queen, he had abased\r\nhimself to the dust before her, and implored forgiveness in terms better\r\nsuited to a convicted thief than to a knight of the shire. For these he\r\njoined, and for these he forsook, Lord Essex. He continued to plead his\r\npatron’s cause with the Queen as long as he thought that by pleading\r\nthat cause he might serve himself. Nay, he went further; for his\r\nfeelings, though not warm, were kind; he pleaded that cause as long as\r\nhe thought that he could plead it without injury to himself. But when it\r\nbecame evident that Essex was going headlong to his ruin, Bacon began to\r\ntremble for his own fortunes. What he had to fear would not indeed have\r\nbeen very alarming to a man of lofty character. It was not death. It was\r\nnot imprisonment. It was the loss of court favour. It was the being left\r\nbehind by others in the career of ambition. It was the having leisure\r\nto finish the _Instauratio Magna_. The Queen looked coldly on him. The\r\ncourtiers began to consider him as a marked {382}man. He determined to\r\nchange his line of conduct, and to proceed in a new course with so much\r\nvigour as to make up for lost time. When once he had determined to act\r\nagainst his friend, knowing himself to be suspected, he acted with\r\nmore zeal than would have been necessary or justifiable if he had been\r\nemployed against a stranger. He exerted his professional talents to shed\r\nthe Earl’s blood, and his literary talents to blacken the Earl’s memory.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that his conduct excited at the time great and general\r\ndisapprobation. While Elizabeth lived, indeed, this disapprobation,\r\nthough deeply felt, was not loudly expressed. But a great change was at\r\nhand. The health of the Queen had long been decaying; and the operation\r\nof age and disease was now assisted by acute mental suffering. The\r\npitiable melancholy of her last days has generally been ascribed to her\r\nfond regret for Essex. But we are disposed to attribute her dejection\r\npartly to physical causes, and partly to the conduct of her courtiers\r\nand ministers. They did all in their power to conceal from her the\r\nintrigues which they were carrying on at the Court of Scotland. But her\r\nkeen sagacity was not to be so deceived. She did not know the whole. But\r\nshe knew that she was surrounded by men who were impatient for that new\r\nworld which was to begin at her death, who had never been attached to\r\nher by affection, and who were now but very slightly attached to her by\r\ninterest. Prostration and flattery could not conceal from her the cruel\r\ntruth, that those whom she had trusted and promoted had never loved her,\r\nand were fast ceasing to fear her. Unable to avenge herself, and too\r\nproud to complain, she suffered sorrow and resentment to prey on her\r\nheart, till, after a {383}long career of power, prosperity, and glory,\r\nshe died sick and weary of the world.\r\n\r\nJames mounted the throne: and Bacon employed all his address to obtain\r\nfor himself a share of the favour of his new master. This was no\r\ndifficult task. The faults of James, both as a man and as a prince, were\r\nnumerous; but insensibility to the claims of genius and learning was\r\nnot among them. He was indeed made up of two men, a witty, well-read\r\nscholar, who wrote, disputed and harangued, and a nervous, drivelling;\r\nidiot, who acted. If he had been a Canon of Christ Church, or a\r\nPrebendary of Westminster, it is not improbable that he would have left\r\na highly respectable name to posterity; that he would have distinguished\r\nhimself among the translators of the Bible, and among the Divines who\r\nattended the Synod of Dort; and that he would have been regarded by the\r\nliterary world as no contemptible rival of Vossius and Casanbon. But\r\nfortune placed him in a situation in which his weaknesses covered him\r\nwith disgrace, and in which his accomplishments brought him no honour.\r\nIn a college, much eccentricity and childishness would have been readily\r\npardoned in so learned a man. But all that learning; could do for him on\r\nthe throne was to make people think him a pedant as well as a fool.\r\n\r\nBacon was favourably received at Court; and soon found that his chance\r\nof promotion was not diminished by the death of the Queen. He was\r\nsolicitous to be knighted, for two reasons which are somewhat amusing.\r\n\r\nThe King had already dubbed half London, and Bacon found himself the\r\nonly untitled person in his mess at Gray’s Inn. This was not very\r\nagreeable to him. He had also, to quote his own words, “found an\r\nAlderman’s daughter, a handsome maiden, to his {384}liking.” On both\r\nthese grounds, he begged his cousin Robert Cecil, “if it might please\r\nhis good Lordship,” to use his interest in his behalf. The application\r\nwas successful. Bacon was one of three hundred gentlemen who, on the\r\ncoronation-day, received the honour, if it is to be so called, of\r\nknighthood. The handsome maiden, a daughter of Alderman Barnham, soon\r\nafter consented to become Sir Francis’s lady.\r\n\r\nThe death of Elizabeth, though on the whole it improved Bacon’s\r\nprospects, was in one respect an unfortunate event for him. The new King\r\nhad always felt kindly towards Lord Essex, and, as soon as he came to\r\nthe throne, began to show favour to the house of Devereux, and to those\r\nwho had stood by that house in its adversity. Everybody was now at\r\nliberty to speak out respecting those lamentable events in which Bacon\r\nhad borne so large a share. Elizabeth was scarcely cold when the public\r\nfeeling began to manifest itself by marks of respect towards Lord\r\nSouthampton. That accomplished nobleman, who will be remembered to the\r\nlatest ages as the generous and discerning patron of Shakspeare, was\r\nheld in honour by his contemporaries chiefly on account of the devoted\r\naffection which he had borne to Essex. He had been tried and convicted\r\ntogether with his friend; but the Queen had spared his life, and, at the\r\ntime of her death, he was still a prisoner. A crowd of visitors hastened\r\nto the Tower to congratulate him on his approaching deliverance. With\r\nthat crowd Bacon could not venture to mingle. The multitude loudly\r\ncondemned him; and his conscience told him that the multitude had but\r\ntoo much reason. He excused himself to Southampton by letter, in terms\r\nwhich, if he had, as Mr. Montagu conceives, done only what as a\r\nsubject and an advocate he was bound to do, {385}must be considered\r\nas shamefully servile. He owns his fear that his attendance would give\r\noffence, and that his professions of regard would obtain no credit.\r\n“Yet,” says he, “it is as true as a thing that God knoweth, that this\r\ngreat chancre hath wrought in me no other change towards your Lordship\r\nthan this, that I may safely be that to you now which I was truly\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nHow Southampton received these apologies we are not informed. But it\r\nis certain that the general opinion was pronounced against Bacon in a\r\nmanner not to be misunderstood. Soon after his marriage he put forth a\r\ndefence of his conduct, in the form of a letter to the Earl of Devon.\r\nThis tract seems to us to prove only the exceeding badness of a cause\r\nfor which such talents could do so little.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that Bacon’s Defence had much effect on his\r\ncontemporaries. But the unfavourable impression which his conduct had\r\nmade appears to have been gradually effaced. Indeed it must be some very\r\npeculiar cause that can make a man like him long unpopular. His talents\r\nsecured him from contempt, his temper and his manners from hatred. There\r\nis scarcely any story so black that it may not be got over by a man of\r\ngreat abilities, whose abilities are united with caution, good-humour,\r\npatience, and affability, who pays daily sacrifice to Nemesis, who is a\r\ndelightful companion, a serviceable though not an ardent friend, and\r\na dangerous yet a placable enemy. Waller in the next generation was an\r\neminent instance of this. Indeed Waller had much more than may at first\r\nsight appear in common with Bacon. To the higher intellectual qualities\r\nof the great English philosopher, to the genius which has made an\r\nimmortal epoch in the history of {386}science, Waller had indeed no\r\npretensions. But the mind of Waller, as far as it extended, coincided\r\nwith that of Bacon, and might, so to speak, have been cut out of that\r\nof Bacon. In the qualities which make a man an object of interest and\r\nveneration to posterity, they cannot be compared together. But in the\r\nqualities by which chiefly a man is known to his contemporaries there\r\nwas a striking similarity between them. Considered as men of the world,\r\nas courtiers, as politicians, as associates, as allies, as enemies,\r\nthey had nearly the same merits, and the same defects. They were not\r\nmalignant. They were not tyrannical. But they wanted warmth of affection\r\nand elevation of sentiment. There were many things which they loved\r\nbetter than virtue, and which they feared more than guilt. Yet, even\r\nafter they had stooped to acts of which it is impossible to read the\r\naccount in the most partial narratives without strong disapprobation and\r\ncontempt, the public still continued to regard them with a feeling not\r\neasily to be distinguished from esteem. The hyperbole of Juliet seemed\r\nto be verified with respect to them. “Upon their brows shame was\r\nashamed to sit.” Everybody seemed as desirous to throw’ a veil over\r\ntheir misconduct as if it had been his own. Clarendon, who felt, and who\r\nhad reason to feel, strong personal dislike towards Y aller, speaks of\r\nhim thus: “There needs no more to be said to extol the excellence and\r\npower of his wit and pleasantness of his conversation, than that it was\r\nof magnitude enough to cover a world of very great faults, that is, so\r\nto cover them that they were not taken notice of to his reproach, viz. a\r\nnarrowness in his nature to the lowest degree, an abjectness and want of\r\ncourage to support him in any virtuous undertaking, an insinuation\r\nand servile flattery to the height {387}the vainest and most imperious\r\nnature could be contented with.... It had power to reconcile him to\r\nthose whom he had most offended and provoked, and continued to his\r\nage with that rare felicity, that his company was acceptable where\r\nhis spirit was odious, and he was at least pitied where he was most\r\ndetested.” Much of this, with some softening, might, we fear, be\r\napplied to Bacon. The influence of Waller’s talents, manners, and\r\naccomplishments, died with him; and the world has pronounced an\r\nunbiassed sentence on his character. A few flowing lines are not bribe\r\nsufficient to pervert the judgment of posterity. But the influence\r\nof Bacon is felt and will long be felt over the whole civilised world.\r\nLeniently as he was treated by his contemporaries, posterity has treated\r\nhim more leniently still. Turn where we may, the trophies of that mighty\r\nintellect are full in view. We are judging Manlius in sight of the\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\nUnder the reign of James, Bacon grew rapidly in fortune and favour. In\r\n1604 he was appointed King’s Counsel, with a fee of forty pounds a year;\r\nand a pension of sixty pounds a year was settled upon him. In 1607 he\r\nbecame Solicitor-General, in 1612 Attorney-General. He continued to\r\ndistinguish himself in Parliament, particularly by his exertions in\r\nfavour of one excellent measure on which the King’s heart was set,\r\nthe union of England and Scotland. It was not difficult for such an\r\nintellect to discover many irresistible arguments in favour of such a\r\nscheme. He conducted the great case of the _Post Nati_ in the Exchequer\r\nChamber; and the decision of the judges, a decision the legality of\r\nwhich may be questioned, but the beneficial effect of which must\r\nbe acknowledged, was in a great measure attributed to his dexterous\r\nmanagement. {388}While actively engaged in the House of Commons and in\r\nthe courts of law, he still found leisure for letters and philosophy.\r\nThe noble treatise on the “Advancement of Learning,” which at a later\r\nperiod was expanded into the _De Augmentis_, appeared in 1605. The\r\n“Wisdom of the Ancients,” a work which, if it had proceeded from any\r\nother writer, would have been considered as a masterpiece of wit and\r\nlearning, but which adds little to the fame of Bacon, was printed\r\nin 1609. In the mean time the _Novum Organum_ was slowly proceeding.\r\nSeveral distinguished men of learning had been permitted to see sketches\r\nor detached portions of that extraordinary book; and, though they were\r\nnot generally disposed to admit the soundness of the author’s views,\r\nthey spoke with the greatest admiration of his genius. Sir Thomas\r\nBodley, the founder of one of the most magnificent of English libraries,\r\nwas among those stubborn Conservatives who considered the hopes with\r\nwhich Bacon looked forward to the future destinies of the human race\r\nas utterly chimerical, and who regarded with distrust and aversion the\r\ninnovating spirit of the new schismatics in philosophy. Yet even Bodley,\r\nafter perusing the _Cogitata et Visa_, one of the most precious of those\r\nscattered leaves out of which the great oracular volume was afterwards\r\nmade up, acknowledged that in “those very points, and in all proposals\r\nand plots in that book, Bacon showed himself a master-workman;” and\r\nthat “it could not be gainsaid but all the treatise over did abound\r\nwith choice conceits of the present state of learning, and with worthy\r\ncontemplations of the means to procure it.” In 1612, a new edition of\r\nthe “Essays” appeared, with additions surpassing the original collection\r\nboth in bulk and quality. Nor did {389}these pursuits distract Bacon’s\r\nattention from a work the most arduous, the most glorious, and the most\r\nuseful that even his mighty powers could have achieved, “the reducing\r\nand recompiling,” to use his own phrase, “of the laws of England.”\r\n\r\nUnhappily he was at that very time employed in perverting those laws to\r\nthe vilest purposes of tyranny. When Oliver St. John was brought before\r\nthe Star Chamber for maintaining that the King had no right to levy\r\nBenevolences, and was for his manly and constitutional conduct sentenced\r\nto imprisonment during the royal pleasure and to a fine of five thousand\r\npounds, Bacon appeared as counsel for the prosecution. About the same\r\ntime he was deeply engaged in a still more disgraceful transaction.\r\nAn aged clergyman, of the name of Peacham, was accused of treason on\r\naccount of some passages of a sermon which was found in his study. The\r\nsermon, whether written by him or not, had never been preached. It did\r\nnot appear that he had any intention of preaching it. The most servile\r\nlawyers of those servile times were forced to admit that there were\r\ngreat difficulties both as to the facts and as to the law. Bacon was\r\nemployed to remove those difficulties. He was employed to settle the\r\nquestion of law by tampering with the judges, and the question of fact\r\nby torturing the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThree judges of the Court of King’s Bench were tractable. But Coke was\r\nmade of different stuff. Pedant, bigot, and brute as he was, he had\r\nqualities which bore a strong, though a very disagreeable resemblance\r\nto some of the highest virtues which a public man can possess. He was an\r\nexception to a maxim which we believe to be generally true, that those\r\nwho trample on the helpless are disposed to cringe to the powerful.\r\n{390}He behaved with gross rudeness to his juniors at the bar, and with\r\nexecrable cruelty to prisoners on trial for their lives. But he stood up\r\nmanfully against the King and the King’s favourites. No man of that age\r\nappeared to so little advantage when he was opposed to an inferior, and\r\nwas in the wrong. But, on the other hand, it is but fair to admit that\r\nno man of that age made so creditable a figure when he was opposed to\r\na superior, and happened to be in the right. On such occasions,\r\nhis half-suppressed insolence and his impracticable obstinacy had a\r\nrespectable and interesting appearance, when compared with the abject\r\nservility of the bar and of the bench. On the present occasion he was\r\nstubborn and surly. He declared that it was a new and a highly improper\r\npractice in the judges to confer with a law-officer of the crown about\r\ncapital cases which they were afterwards to try; and for some time he\r\nresolutely kept aloof. But Bacon was equally artful and persevering. “I\r\nam not wholly out of hope,” said he in a letter to the King, “that my\r\nLord Coke himself, when I have in some dark manner put him in doubt that\r\nhe shall be left alone, will not be singular.” After some time Bacon’s\r\ndexterity was successful; and Coke, sullenly and reluctantly, followed\r\nthe example of his brethren. But in order to convict Peacham it was\r\nnecessary to find facts as well as law. Accordingly, this wretched old\r\nman was put to the rack, and, while undergoing the horrible infliction,\r\nwas examined by Bacon, but in vain. No confession could be wrung out of\r\nhim; and Bacon wrote to the King, complaining that Peacham had a dumb\r\ndevil. At length the trial came on. A conviction was obtained; but the\r\ncharges were so obviously futile, that the government could not, for\r\nvery shame, carry the sentence into execution; and {391}Peacham was\r\nsuffered to languish away the short remainder of his life in a prison.\r\n\r\nAll this frightful story Mr. Montagu relates fairly. He neither conceals\r\nnor distorts any material fact. But he can see nothing deserving of\r\ncondemnation in Bacon’s conduct. He tells us most truly that we ought\r\nnot to try the men of one age by the standard of another; that Sir\r\nMatthew Hale is not to be pronounced a bad man because he left a woman\r\nto be executed for witchcraft; that posterity will not be justified\r\nin censuring judges of our time, for selling offices in their courts,\r\naccording to the established practice, bad as that practice was; and\r\nthat Bacon is entitled to similar indulgence. “To persecute the lover\r\nof truth,” says Mr. Montagu, “for opposing established customs, and\r\nto censure him in after ages for not having been more strenuous in\r\nopposition, are errors which will never cease until the pleasure of\r\nself-elevation from the depression of superiority is no more.”\r\n\r\nWe have no dispute with Mr. Montagu about the general proposition. We\r\nassent to every word of it. But does it apply to the present case? Is it\r\ntrue that in the time of James the First it was the established practice\r\nfor the law-officers of the Crown, to hold private consultations with\r\nthe judges, touching capital cases which those judges were afterwards to\r\ntry? Certainly not. In the very page in which Mr. Montagu asserts that\r\n“the influencing a judge out of court seems at that period scarcely to\r\nhave been considered as improper,” he gives the very words of Sir Edward\r\nCoke on the subject. “I will not thus declare what may be my judgment by\r\nthese auricular confessions of _new_ and pernicious tendency, and _not\r\naccording to the customs of the realm_.” Is it possible to imagine that\r\nCoke, who {392}had himself been Attorney-General during thirteen years,\r\nwho had conducted a far greater number of important state-prosecutions\r\nthan any other lawyer named in English history, and who had passed with\r\nscarcely any interval from the Attorney-Generalship to the first scat\r\nin the first criminal court in the realm, could have been startled at an\r\ninvitation to confer with the crown-lawyers, and could have pronounced\r\nthe practice new, if it had really been an established usage? We well\r\nknow that, where property only was at stake, it was then a common,\r\nthough a most culpable practice, in the judges, to listen to private\r\nsolicitations. But the practice ot tampering with judges in order to\r\nprocure capital convictions we believe to have been new, first, because\r\nCoke, who understood those matters better than any man of his time,\r\nasserted it to be new; and secondly, because neither Bacon nor Mr.\r\nMontagu has shown a single precedent.\r\n\r\nHow then stands the case? Even thus: Bacon was not conforming to an\r\nusage then generally admitted to be proper. He was not even the last\r\nlingering adherent of an old abuse. It would have been sufficiently\r\ndisgraceful to such a man to be in this last situation. Yet this last\r\nsituation would have been honourable compared with that in which he\r\nstood. He was guilty of attempting to introduce into the courts of law\r\nan odious abuse for which no precedent could be found. Intellectually,\r\nhe was better fitted than any man that England has ever produced for the\r\nwork of improving her institutions. But, unhappily, we see that he did\r\nnot scruple to exert his great powers for the purpose of introducing\r\ninto those institutions new corruptions of the foulest kind.\r\n\r\nThe same, or nearly the same, may be said of the {393}torturing of\r\nPeacham. If it be true that in the time of James the First the propriety\r\nof torturing prisoners was generally allowed, we should admit this as an\r\nexcuse, though we should admit it less readily in the case of such a man\r\nas Bacon than in the case of an ordinary lawyer or politician. But the\r\nfact is, that the practice of torturing prisoners was then generally\r\nacknowledged by lawyers to be illegal, and was execrated by the public\r\nas barbarous. More than thirty years before Peacham’s trial, that\r\npractice was so loudly condemned by the voice of the nation that\r\nLord Burleigh found it necessary to publish an apology for having\r\noccasionally resorted to it. But though the dangers which then\r\nthreatened the government were of a very different kind from those which\r\nwere to be apprehended from any thing that Peacham could write, though\r\nthe life of the Queen and the dearest interests of the state were in\r\njeopardy, though the circumstances were such that all ordinary laws\r\nmight seem to be superseded by that highest law, the public safety, the\r\napology did not satisfy the country: and the Queen found it expedient to\r\nissue an order positively forbidding the torturing of state-prisoners on\r\nany pretence whatever. From that time, the practice of torturing, which\r\nhad always been unpopular, which had always been illegal, had also been\r\nunusual. It is well known that in 1628, only fourteen years after the\r\ntime when Bacon went to the Tower to listen to the yells of Peacham,\r\nthe judges decided that Felton, a criminal who neither deserved nor was\r\nlikely to obtain any extraordinary indulgence, could not lawfully be put\r\nto the question. We therefore say that Bacon stands in a very different\r\nsituation from that in which Mr. Montagu tries to place him. Bacon was\r\nhere distinctly behind his {394}age. He was one of the last of the tools\r\nof power who persisted in a practice the most barbarous and the most\r\nabsurd that has ever disgraced jurisprudence, in a practice of which, in\r\nthe preceding generation, Elizabeth and her ministers had been ashamed,\r\nin a practice which, a few years later, no sycophant in all the Inns of\r\nCourt had the heart or the forehead to defend. (1)\r\n\r\nBacon far behind his age! Bacon far behind Sir Edward Coke! Bacon\r\nclinging to exploded abuses! Bacon withstanding the progress of\r\nimprovement! Bacon struggling to push back the human mind! The words\r\nseem strange. They sound like a contradiction in terms. Yet the fact is\r\neven so: and the explanation may be readily found by any person who\r\nis not blinded by prejudice. Mr. Montagu cannot believe that so\r\nextraordinary a man as Bacon could be guilty of a bad action; as if\r\nhistory were not made up of the bad actions of extraordinary men, as\r\nif all the most noted destroyers and deceivers of our species, all the\r\nfounders of arbitrary governments and false religions, had not been\r\nextraordinary men, as if nine tenths of the calamities which have\r\nbefallen the human race had any other origin than the union of high\r\nintelligence with low desires.\r\n\r\nBacon knew this well. He has told us that there\r\n\r\n     (1) Since this Review was written, Mr. Jardine has published\r\n     a very learned and ingenious Reading on the use of torture\r\n     in England. It has not, however, been thought necessary to\r\n     make any change in the observations on Peacham’s case.\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to discuss within the limits of a note, the\r\n     extensive question raised by Mr. Jardine. It is sufficient\r\n     here to say that every argument by which he attempts to show\r\n     that the use of the rack was anciently a lawful exertion of\r\n     royal prerogative may be urged with equal force, nay with\r\n     far greater force, to prove the lawfulness of benevolences,\r\n     of ship-money, of Mompesson’s patent, of Eliot’s\r\n     imprisonment, of every abuse, without exception, which is\r\n     condemned by the Petition of Right and the Declaration of\r\n     Right.\r\n\r\n{395}are persons “scientia tanquam angel’ alati, cupiditati-bus vero\r\ntanquam serpentes qui humi reptant;” (1) and it did not require his\r\nadmirable sagacity and his extensive converse with mankind to make the\r\ndiscovery. Indeed, he had only to look within. The difference between\r\nthe soaring angel and the creeping snake was but a type of the\r\ndifference between Bacon the philosopher and Bacon the Attorney-General,\r\nBacon seeking for truth, and Bacon seeking for the Seals. Those who\r\nsurvey only one half of his character may speak of him with unmixed\r\nadmiration, or with unmixed contempt. But those only judge of him\r\ncorrectly who take in at one view Bacon in speculation and Bacon in\r\naction. They will have no difficulty in comprehending how one and the\r\nsame man should have been far before his age and far behind it, in one\r\nline the boldest and most useful of innovators, in another line the most\r\nobstinate champion of the foulest abuses. In his library, all his rare\r\npowers were under the guidance of an honest ambition, of an enlarged\r\nphilanthropy, of a sincere love of truth. There, no temptation drew\r\nhim away from the right course. Thomas Aquinas could pay no fees, Duns\r\nScotus could confer no peerages. The Master of the Sentences had no rich\r\nreversions in his gift. Far different was the situation of the great\r\nphilosopher when he came forth from his study and his laboratory to\r\nmingle with the crowd which filled the galleries of Whitehall. In\r\nall that crowd there was no man equally qualified to render great and\r\nlasting services to mankind. But in all that crowd there was not a heart\r\nmore set on things which no man ought to suffer to be necessary to\r\n\r\n     (1) _De Augmentes_. Lib. v. Cap. 1.\r\n\r\n{396}his happiness, on things which can often be obtained only by the\r\nsacrifice of integrity and honour. To be the leader of the human race in\r\nthe career of improvement, to found on the ruins of ancient intellectual\r\ndynasties a more prosperous and a more enduring empire, to be revered by\r\nthe latest generations as the most illustrious among the benefactors of\r\nmankind, all this was within his reach. But all this availed him nothing\r\nwhile some quibbling special pleader was promoted before him to the\r\nbench, while some heavy country gentleman took precedence of him by\r\nvirtue of a purchased coronet, while some pandar, happy in a fair wife,\r\ncould obtain a more cordial salute from Buckingham, while some buffoon,\r\nversed in all the latest scandal of the court, could draw a louder laugh\r\nfrom James.\r\n\r\nDuring a long course of years, Bacon’s unworthy ambition was crowned\r\nwith success. His sagacity early enabled him to perceive who was likely\r\nto become the most powerful man in the kingdom. He probably knew the\r\nKing’s mind before it was known to the King himself, and attached\r\nhimself to Villiers, while the less discerning crowd of courtiers still\r\ncontinued to fawn on Somerset. The influence of the younger favourite\r\nbecame greater daily. The contest between the rivals might, however,\r\nhave lasted long, but for that frightful crime which, in spite of all\r\nthat could be effected by the research and ingenuity of historians, is\r\nstill covered with so mysterious an obscurity. The descent of Somerset\r\nhad been a gradual and almost imperceptible lapse. It now became a\r\nheadlong fall; and Villiers, left without a competitor, rapidly rose\r\nto a height of power such as no subject since Wolsey had attained.\r\n{397}There were many points of resemblance between the two celebrated\r\ncourtiers who, at different times, extended their patronage to Bacon.\r\nIt is difficult to say whether Essex or Villiers was more eminently\r\ndistinguished by those graces of person and manner which have always\r\nbeen rated in courts at much more than their real value. Both were\r\nconstitutionally brave; and both, like most men who are constitutionally\r\nbrave, were open and unreserved. Both were rash and headstrong. Both\r\nwere destitute of the abilities and of the information which are\r\nnecessary to statesmen. Yet both, trusting to the accomplishments which\r\nhad made them conspicuous in tilt-yards and ball-rooms, aspired to rule\r\nthe state. Both owed their elevation to the personal attachment of the\r\nsovereign; and in both cases this attachment was of so eccentric a\r\nkind, that it perplexed observers, that it still continues to perplex\r\nhistorians, and that it gave rise to much scandal which we are inclined\r\nto think unfounded. Each of them treated the sovereign whose favour he\r\nenjoyed with a rudeness which approached to insolence. This petulance\r\nruined Essex, who had to deal with a spirit naturally as proud as his\r\nown, and accustomed, during near half a century, to the most respectful\r\nobservance. But there was a wide difference between the haughty daughter\r\nof Henry and her successor. James was timid from the cradle. His nerves,\r\nnaturally weak, had not been fortified by reflection or by habit. His\r\nlife, till he came to England, had been a series of mortifications and\r\nhumiliations. With all his high notions of the origin and extent of his\r\nprerogatives, he was never his own master for a day. In spite of his\r\nkingly title, in spite of his despotic theories, he was to the last a\r\nslave at heart. Villiers treated him like {398}one; and this course,\r\nthough adopted, we believe, merely from temper, succeeded as well as if\r\nit had been a system of policy formed after mature deliberation.\r\n\r\nIn generosity, in sensibility, in capacity for friendship, Essex far\r\nsurpassed Buckingham. Indeed, Buckingham can scarcely be said to\r\nhave had any friend, with the exception of the two princes over whom\r\nsuccessively he exercised so wonderful an influence. Essex was to the\r\nlast adored by the people. Buckingham was always a most unpopular man,\r\nexcept perhaps for a very short time after his return from the childish\r\nvisit to Spain. Essex fell a victim to the rigour of the government\r\namidst the lamentations of the people. Buckingham, execrated by the\r\npeople, and solemnly declared a public enemy by the representatives of\r\nthe people, fell by the hand of one of the people, and was lamented by\r\nnone but his master.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the two favourites acted towards Bacon was highly\r\ncharacteristic, and may serve to illustrate the old and true saying,\r\nthat a man is generally more inclined to feel kindly towards one on\r\nwhom he has conferred favours than towards one from whom he has received\r\nthem. Essex loaded Bacon with benefits, and never thought that he had\r\ndone enough. It seems never to have crossed the mind of the powerful\r\nand wealthy noble that the poor barrister whom he treated with such\r\nmunificent kindness was not his equal. It was, we have no doubt, with\r\nperfect sincerity that the Earl declared that he would willingly give\r\nhis sister or daughter in marriage to his friend. He was in general more\r\nthan sufficiently sensible of his own merits; but he did not seem to\r\nknow that he had ever deserved well of Bacon. On that cruel day when\r\nthey saw each other for the last time at the bar of the Lords, Essex\r\n{399}taxed his perfidious friend with unkindness and insincerity, but\r\nnever with ingratitude. Even in such a moment, more bitter than the\r\nbitterness of death, that noble heart was too great to vent itself in\r\nsuch a reproach.\r\n\r\nVilliers, on the other hand, owed much to Bacon. When their acquaintance\r\nbegan, Sir Francis was a man of mature age, of high station, and of\r\nestablished fame as a politician, an advocate, and a writer. Villiers\r\nwas little more than a boy, a younger son of a house then of no great\r\nnote. He was but just entering on the career of court favour; and none\r\nbut the most discerning observers could as yet perceive that he was\r\nlikely to distance all his competitors. The countenance and advice of\r\na man so highly distinguished as the Attorney-General must have been\r\nan object of the highest importance to the young adventurer. But though\r\nVilliers was the obliged party, he was far less warmly attached to\r\nBacon, and far less delicate in his conduct towards Bacon, than Essex\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nTo do the new favourite justice, he early exerted his influence in\r\nbehalf of his illustrious friend. In 1616, Sir Francis was sworn of the\r\nPrivy Council, and in March, 1617, on the retirement of Lord Brackley,\r\nwas appointed Keeper of the Great Seal.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of May, the first day of term, he rode in state to\r\nWestminster Hall, with the Lord Treasurer on his right hand, the Lord\r\nPrivy Seal on his left, a long procession of students and ushers before\r\nhim, and a crowd of peers, privy-councillors, and judges following in\r\nhis train. Having entered his court, he addressed the splendid auditory\r\nin a grave and dignified speech, which proves how well he understood\r\nthose judicial duties which he afterwards performed so ill. {400}Even\r\nat that moment, the proudest moment of his life in the estimation of\r\nthe vulgar, and, it may be, even in his own, he cast back a look of\r\nlingering affection towards those noble pursuits from which, as it\r\nseemed, he was about to be estranged. “The depth of the three long\r\nvacations,” said he, “I would reserve in some measure free from business\r\nof estate, and for studies, arts, and sciences, to which of my own\r\nnature I am most inclined.”\r\n\r\nThe years during which Bacon held the Great Seal were among the darkest\r\nand most shameful in English history. Every thing at home and abroad was\r\nmismanaged. First came the execution of Raleigh, an act which, if done\r\nin a proper manner, might have been defensible, but which, under all\r\nthe circumstances, must be considered as a dastardly murder. Worse was\r\nbehind, the war of Bohemia, the successes of Tilly and Spinola, the\r\nPalatinate conquered, the King’s son-in-law an exile, the house of\r\nAustria dominant on the Continent, the Protestant religion and the\r\nliberties of the Germanic body trodden under foot. Meanwhile, the\r\nwavering and cowardly policy of England furnished matter of ridicule\r\nto all the nations of Europe. The love of peace which James professed\r\nwould, even when indulged to an impolitic excess, have been respectable,\r\nif it had proceeded from tenderness for his people. But the truth is\r\nthat, while he had nothing to spare for the defence of the natural\r\nallies of England, he resorted without scruple to the most illegal\r\nand oppressive devices, for the purpose of enabling Buckingham and\r\nBuckingham’s relations to outshine the ancient aristocracy of the realm.\r\nBenevolences were exacted. Patents of monopoly were multiplied. All\r\nthe resources which could have been employed to replenish a beggared\r\n{401}Exchequer, at the close of a ruinous war, were put in motion during\r\nthis season of ignominious peace.\r\n\r\nThe vices of the administration must be chiefly ascribed to the weakness\r\nof the King and to the levity and violence of the favourite. But it\r\nis impossible to acquit the Lord Keeper of all share in the guilt. For\r\nthose odious patents, in particular, which passed the Great Seal while\r\nit was in his charge, he must be held answerable. In the speech which\r\nhe made on first taking his seat in his court, he had pledged himself to\r\ndischarge this important part of his functions with the greatest caution\r\nand impartiality. He had declared that he “would walk in the light,\r\nthat men should see that no particular turn or end led him, but a\r\ngeneral rule.” Mr. Montagu would have us believe that Bacon acted up\r\nto these professions, and says that “the power of the favourite did not\r\ndeter the Lord Keeper from staying grants and patents when his public\r\nduty demanded this interposition.” Does Mr. Montagu consider patents of\r\nMonopoly as good things? Or does he mean to say that Bacon staid every\r\npatent of monopoly that came before him? Of all patents in our history,\r\nthe most disgraceful was that which was granted to Sir Giles Mompesson,\r\nsupposed to be the original of Massinger’s Overreach, and to Sir Francis\r\nMichell, from whom Justice Greedy is supposed to have been drawn, for\r\nthe exclusive manufacturing of gold and silver lace. The effect of this\r\nmonopoly was of course that the metal employed in the manufacture was\r\nadulterated to the great loss of the public. But this was a trifle. The\r\npatentees were armed with powers as great as have ever been given\r\nto farmers of the revenue in the worst governed countries. They were\r\nauthorised to search houses and to arrest interlopers; and these\r\nformidable {402}powers were used for purposes viler than even those\r\nfor which they were given, for the wreaking of old grudges, and for the\r\ncorrupting of female chastity. Was not this a ease in which public duty\r\ndemanded the interposition of the Lord Keeper? And did the Lord Keeper\r\ninterpose? He did. He wrote to inform the King, that he “had considered\r\nof the fitness and conveniency of the gold and silver thread business,”\r\n “that it was convenient that it should be settled,” that he “did\r\nconceive apparent likelihood that it would redound much to his Majesty’s\r\nprofit,” that, therefore, “it were good it were settled with all\r\nconvenient speed.” The meaning of all this was, that certain of the\r\nhouse of Villiers were to go shares with Overreach and Greedy in the\r\nplunder of the public. This was the way in which, when the favourite\r\npressed for patents, lucrative to his relations and to his creatures,\r\nruinous and vexatious to the body of the people, the chief guardian\r\nof the laws interposed. Having assisted the patentees to obtain this\r\nmonopoly, Bacon assisted them also in the steps which they took for the\r\npurpose of guarding it. He committed several people to close confinement\r\nfor disobeying his tyrannical edict. It is needless to say more. Our\r\nreaders are now able to judge whether, in the matter of patents, Bacon\r\nacted conformably to his professions, or deserved the praise which his\r\nbiographer has bestowed on him.\r\n\r\nIn his judicial capacity his conduct was not less reprehensible. He\r\nsuffered Buckingham to dictate many of his decisions. Bacon knew as\r\nwell as any man that a judge who listens to private solicitations is\r\na disgrace to his post. He had himself, before he was raised to the\r\nwoolsack, represented this strongly to Villiers, then just entering on\r\nhis career. “By no {403}means,” said Sir Francis, in a letter of advice\r\naddressed to the young courtier, “by no means be you persuaded to\r\ninterpose yourself, either by word or letter, in any cause depending in\r\nany court of justice, nor suffer any great man to do it where you can\r\nhinder it. If it should prevail, it perverts justice; but, if the judge\r\nbe so just and of such courage as he ought to be, as not to be inclined\r\nthereby, yet it always leaves a taint of suspicion behind it.” Yet he\r\nhad not been Lord Keeper a month when Buckingham began to interfere in\r\nChancery suits; and Buckingham’s interference was, as might have been\r\nexpected, successful.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu’s reflections on the excellent passage which we have quoted\r\nabove are exceedingly amusing. “No man,” says he, “more deeply felt\r\nthe evils which then existed of the interference of the Crown and\r\nof statesmen to influence judges. How beautifully did he admonish\r\nBuckingham, regardless as he proved of all admonition!” We should be\r\nglad to know how it can be expected that admonition will be regarded by\r\nhim who receives it, when it is altogether neglected by him who gives\r\nit. We do not defend Buckingham: but what was his guilt to Bacon’s?\r\nBuckingham was young, ignorant, thoughtless, dizzy with the rapidity of\r\nhis ascent and the height of his position. That he should be eager to\r\nserve his relations, his flatterers, his mistresses, that he should\r\nnot fully apprehend the immense importance of a pure administration of\r\njustice, that he should think more about those who were bound to him\r\nby private ties than about the public interest, all this was perfectly\r\nnatural, and not altogether unpardonable. Those who intrust a petulant,\r\nhot-blooded, ill-informed lad with power, are more to blame, than he for\r\nthe mischief which he may do with {404}it. How could it be expected of a\r\nlively page, raised by a wild freak of fortune to the first influence\r\nin the empire, that he should have bestowed any serious thought on the\r\nprinciples which ought to guide judicial decisions? Bacon was the ablest\r\npublic man then living in Europe. He was near sixty years old. He had\r\nthought much, and to good purpose, on the general principles of law. He\r\nhad for many years borne a part daily in the administration of justice.\r\nIt was impossible that a man with a tithe of his sagacity and experience\r\nshould not have known that a judge who suffers friends or patrons to\r\ndictate his decrees violates the plainest rules of duty. In fact, as we\r\nhave seen, he knew this well: he expressed it admirably. Neither on this\r\noccasion nor on any other could his bad actions be attributed to any\r\ndefect of the head. They sprang from quite a different cause.\r\n\r\nA man who stooped to render such services to others was not likely to\r\nbe scrupulous as to the means by which he enriched himself. He and his\r\ndependents accepted large presents from persons who were engaged in\r\nChancery suits. The amount of the plunder which he collected in this\r\nway it is impossible to estimate. There can be no doubt that he received\r\nvery much more than was proved on his trial, though, it may be, less\r\nthan was suspected by the public. His enemies stated his illicit gains\r\nat a hundred thousand pounds. But this was probably an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nIt was long before the day of reckoning arrived. During the interval\r\nbetween the second and third Parliaments of James, the nation was\r\nabsolutely governed by the Crown. The prospects of the Lord Keeper were\r\nbright and serene. His great place rendered the {405}splendour of his\r\ntalents even more conspicuous, and gave an additional charm to the\r\nserenity of his temper, the courtesy of his manners, and the eloquence\r\nof his conversation. The pillaged suitor might mutter. The austere\r\nPuritan patriot might, in his retreat, grieve that one on whom God had\r\nbestowed without measure all the abilities which qualify men to take the\r\nlead in great reforms should be found among the adherents of the worst\r\nabuses. But the murmurs of the suitor and the lamentations of the\r\npatriot had scarcely any avenue to the ears of the powerful. The King,\r\nand the minister who was the King’s master, smiled on their illustrious\r\nflatterer. The whole crowd of courtiers and nobles sought his favour\r\nwith emulous eagerness. Men of wit and learning hailed with delight\r\nthe elevation of one who had so signally shown that a man of profound\r\nlearning and of brilliant wit might understand, far better than any\r\nplodding dunce, the art of thriving in the world.\r\n\r\nOnce, and but once, this course of prosperity was for a moment\r\ninterrupted. It should seem that even Bacon’s brain was not strong\r\nenough to bear without some discomposure the inebriating effect of so\r\nmuch good fortune. For some time after his elevation, he showed himself\r\na little wanting in that wariness and self-command to which, more than\r\neven to his transcendent talents, his elevation was to be ascribed. He\r\nwas by no means a good hater. The temperature of his revenge, like that\r\nof his gratitude, was scarcely ever more than lukewarm. But there was\r\none person whom he had long regarded with an animosity which, though\r\nstudiously suppressed, was perhaps the stronger for the suppression. The\r\ninsults and injuries which, when a young man struggling into note and\r\nprofessional practice, {406}he had received from Sir Edward Coke, were\r\nsuch as might move the most placable nature to resentment. About the\r\ntime at which Bacon received the Seals, Coke had, on account of his\r\ncontumacious resistance to the royal pleasure, been deprived of his\r\nseat in the Court of King’s Bench, and had ever since languished in\r\nretirement. But Coke’s opposition to the Court, we fear, was the effect\r\nnot of good principles, but of a bad temper. Perverse and testy as he\r\nwas, he wanted true fortitude and dignity of character. His obstinacy,\r\nunsupported by virtuous motives, was not proof against disgrace. He\r\nsolicited a reconciliation with the favourite, and his solicitations\r\nwere successful. Sir John Villiers, the brother of Buckingham, was\r\nlooking out for a rich wife. Coke had a large fortune and an unmarried\r\ndaughter. A bargain was struck. But Lady Coke, the lady whom twenty\r\nyears before Essex had wooed on behalf of Bacon, would not hear of the\r\nmatch. A violent and scandalous family quarrel followed. The mother\r\ncarried the girl away by stealth. The father pursued them and regained\r\npossession of his daughter by force. The King was then in Scotland, and\r\nBuckingham had attended him thither. Bacon was, during their absence, at\r\nthe head of affairs in England. He felt towards Coke as much malevolence\r\nas it was in his nature to feel towards any body. His wisdom had been\r\nlaid to sleep by prosperity. In an evil hour he determined to interfere\r\nin the disputes which agitated his enemy’s household. He declared for\r\nthe wife, countenanced the Attorney-General in filing an information in\r\nthe Star Chamber against the husband, and wrote letters to the King and\r\nthe favourite against the proposed marriage. The strong language which\r\nhe used in those letters shows that, sagacious {407}as he was, he did\r\nnot quite know his place, and that he was not fully acquainted with\r\nthe extent either of Buckingham’s power, or of the change which the\r\npossession of that power had produced in Buckingham’s character. He soon\r\nhad a lesson which he never forgot. The favourite received the news\r\nof the Lord Keeper’s interference with feelings of the most violent\r\nresentment, and made the King even more angry than himself. Bacon’s eyes\r\nwere at once opened to his error, and to all its possible consequences.\r\nHe had been elated, if not intoxicated, by greatness. The shock sobered\r\nhim in an instant. He was all himself again. He apologized submissively\r\nfor his interference. He directed the Attorney-General to stop the\r\nproceedings against Coke. He sent to tell Lady Coke that he could do\r\nnothing for her. He announced to both the families that he was desirous\r\nto promote the connection. Having given these proofs of contrition, he\r\nventured to present himself before Buckingham. But the young upstart did\r\nnot think that he had yet sufficiently humbled an old man who had been\r\nhis friend and his benefactor, who was the highest civil functionary in\r\nthe realm, and the most eminent man of letters in the world. It is said\r\nthat on two successive days Bacon repaired to Buckingham’s house, that\r\non two successive days he was suffered to remain in an antechamber among\r\nfoot-boys, seated on an old wooden box, with the Great Seal of England\r\nat his side, and that when at length he was admitted, he flung himself\r\non the floor, kissed the favourite’s feet, and vowed never to rise\r\ntill he was forgiven. Sir Anthony Weldon, on whose authority this story\r\nrests, is likely enough to have exaggerated the meanness of Bacon and\r\nthe insolence of Buckingham. But it is difficult to imagine {408}that\r\nso circumstantial a narrative, written by a person who avers that he\r\nwas present on the occasion, can be wholly without foundation; and,\r\nunhappily, there is little in the character either of the favourite or\r\nof the Lord Keeper to make the narrative improbable. It is certain that\r\na reconciliation took place on terms humiliating to Bacon, who never\r\nmore ventured to cross any purpose of any body who bore the name of\r\nVilliers. He put a strong curb on those angry passions which had for the\r\nfirst time in his life mastered his prudence. He went through the\r\nforms of a reconciliation with Coke, and did his best, by seeking\r\nopportunities of paying little civilities, and by avoiding all that\r\ncould produce collision, to tame the untameable ferocity of his old\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nIn the main, however, Bacon’s life, while he held the Great Seal, was,\r\nin outward appearance, most enviable. In London he lived with great\r\ndignity at York House, the venerable mansion of his father. Here it was\r\nthat, in January, 1620, he celebrated his entrance into his sixtieth\r\nyear amidst a splendid circle of friends. He had then exchanged the\r\nappellation of Keeper for the higher title of Chancellor. Ben Jonson was\r\none of the party, and wrote on the occasion some of the happiest of his\r\nrugged rhymes. All things, he tells us, seemed to smile about the old\r\nhouse, “the fire, the wine, the men.” The spectacle of the accomplished\r\nhost, after a life marked by no great disaster, entering on a green\r\nold age, in the enjoyment of riches, power, high honours, undiminished\r\nmental activity, and vast literary reputation, made a strong impression\r\non the {409}poet, if we may judge from those well-known lines;\r\n\r\n                   “England’s high Chancellor, the destined heir,\r\n\r\n                   In his soft cradle, to his father’s chair.”\r\n\r\n                   Whose even thread the Fates spin round and full\r\n\r\n                   Out of their choicest and their whitest wool.”\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of rest which Bacon’s political and judicial functions\r\nafforded, he was in the habit of retiring to Gorhambury. At that place\r\nhis business was literature, and his favourite amusement gardening,\r\nwhich in one of his most interesting Essays he calls “the purest of\r\nhuman pleasures.” In his magnificent grounds, he erected, at a cost of\r\nten thousand pounds, a retreat to which he repaired when he wished\r\nto avoid all visitors, and to devote himself wholly to study. On such\r\noccasions, a few young men of distinguished talents were sometimes\r\nthe companions of his retirement; and among them his quick eye soon\r\ndiscerned the superior abilities of Thomas Hobbes. It is not probable\r\nhowever, that he fully appreciated the powers of his disciple, or\r\nforesaw the vast influence, both for good and for evil, which that most\r\nvigorous and acute of human intellects was destined to exercise on the\r\ntwo succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1621, Bacon had reached the zenith of his fortunes. He had\r\njust published the _Novum Organum_; and that extraordinary book had\r\ndrawn forth the warmest expressions of admiration from the ablest men in\r\nEurope. He had obtained honours of a widely different kind, but perhaps\r\nnot less valued by him. He had been created Baron Verulam. He had\r\nsubsequently been raised to the higher dignity of Viscount St. Albans.\r\nHis patent was drawn in the most flattering terms, and the Prince of\r\nWales signed it as a witness. The ceremony of investiture was performed\r\nwith great state at Theobalds, and Buckingham condescended to be one\r\nof the chief actors. Posterity has felt that the greatest of English\r\nphilosophers could derive {410}no accession of dignity from any title\r\nwhich James could bestow, and, in defiance of the royal letters patent,\r\nhas obstinately refused to degrade Francis Bacon into Viscount St.\r\nAlbans.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks was signally brought to the test the value of those\r\nobjects for which Bacon had sullied his integrity, had resigned his\r\nindependence, had violated the most sacred obligations of friendship and\r\ngratitude, had flattered the worthless, had persecuted the innocent, had\r\ntampered with judges, had tortured prisoners, had plundered suitors,\r\nhad wasted on paltry intrigues, all the powers of the most exquisitely\r\nconstructed intellect that has ever been bestowed on any of the children\r\nof men. A sudden and terrible reverse was at hand. A Parliament had been\r\nsummoned. After six years of silence the voice of the nation was attain\r\nto be heard. Only three days after the pageant which was performed at\r\nTheobalds in honour of Bacon, the Houses met.\r\n\r\nWant of money had, as usual, induced the King to convoke his Parliament.\r\nIt may be doubted, however, whether, if he or his ministers had been at\r\nall aware of the state of public feeling, they would not have tried any\r\nexpedient, or borne with any inconvenience, rather than have ventured\r\nto face the deputies of a justly exasperated nation. But they did not\r\ndiscern those times. Indeed almost all the political blunders of James,\r\nand of his more unfortunate son, arose from one great error. During the\r\nfifty years which preceded the Long Parliament, a great and progressive\r\nchange was taking place in the public mind. The nature and extent of\r\nthis change was not in the least understood by either of the first two\r\nKings of the House of Stuart, or by any of their advisers. That the\r\nnation became more and more discontented every year, that every House of\r\n{411}Commons was more unmanageable than that which had preceded it, were\r\nfacts which it was impossible not to perceive. But the Court could not\r\nunderstand why these things were so. The Court could not see that the\r\nEnglish people and the English Government, though they might once have\r\nbeen well suited to each other, were suited to each other no longer;\r\nthat the nation had outgrown its old institutions, was every day more\r\nuneasy under them, was pressing against them, and would soon burst\r\nthrough them. The alarming phænomena, the existence of which no\r\nsycophant could deny, were ascribed to every cause except the true one.\r\n“In my first Parliament,” said James, “I was a novice. In my next, there\r\nwas a kind of beasts called undertakers,” and so forth. In the third\r\nParliament he could hardly be called a novice, and those beasts, the\r\nundertakers, did not exist. Yet his third Parliament gave him more\r\ntrouble than either the first or the second.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament had no sooner met than the House of Commons proceeded, in\r\na temperate and respectful, but most determined manner, to discuss\r\nthe public grievances. Their first attacks were directed against those\r\nodious patents, under cover of which Buckingham and his creatures\r\nhad pillaged and oppressed the nation. The vigour with which these\r\nproceedings were conducted spread dismay through the Court. Buckingham\r\nthought himself in danger, and, in his alarm, had recourse to an adviser\r\nwho had lately acquired considerable influence over him, Williams,\r\nDean of Westminster. This person had already been of great use to the\r\nfavourite in a very delicate matter. Buckingham had set his heart on\r\nmarrying Lady Catherine Manners, daughter and heiress of the Earl of\r\nRutland. But the difficulties were great. The Earl {412}was haughty and\r\nimpracticable, and the young lady was a Catholic. Williams soothed the\r\npride of the father, and found arguments which, for a time at least,\r\nquieted the conscience of the daughter. For these services he had been\r\nrewarded with considerable preferment in the Church; and he was now\r\nrapidly rising to the same place in the regard of Buckingham which had\r\nformerly been occupied by Bacon.\r\n\r\nWilliams was one of those who are wiser for others than for themselves.\r\nHis own public life was unfortunate, and was made unfortunate by\r\nhis strange want of judgment and self-command at several important\r\nconjunctures. But the counsel which he gave on this occasion showed no\r\nwant of worldly wisdom. He advised the favourite to abandon all thoughts\r\nof defending the monopolies, to find some foreign embassy for his\r\nbrother Sir Edward, who was deeply implicated in the villanies\r\nof Mompesson, and to leave the other offenders to the justice of\r\nParliament. Buckingham received this advice with the warmest expressions\r\nof gratitude, and declared that a load had been lifted from his heart.\r\nHe then repaired with Williams to the royal presence. They found the\r\nKing engaged in earnest consultation with Prince Charles. The plan of\r\noperations proposed by the Dean was fully discussed, and approved in all\r\nits parts.\r\n\r\nThe first victims whom the Court abandoned to the vengeance of the\r\nCommons were Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Michell. It was some\r\ntime before Bacon began to entertain any apprehensions. His talents and\r\nhis address gave him great influence in the house of which he had lately\r\nbecome a member, as indeed they must have in any assembly. In the House\r\nof Commons he had many personal friends and many {413}warm admirers. But\r\nat length, about six weeks after the meeting of Parliament, the storm\r\nburst.\r\n\r\nA committee of the lower House had been appointed to inquire into the\r\nstate of the Courts of Justice. On the fifteenth of March the chairman\r\nof that committee, Sir Robert Philips, member for Bath, reported that\r\ngreat abuses had been discovered. “The person,” said he, “against whom\r\nthese things are alleged is no less than the Lord Chancellor, a man so\r\nendued with all parts, both of nature and art, as that I will say no\r\nmore of him, being not able to say enough.” Sir Robert then proceeded to\r\nstate, in the most temperate manner, the nature of the charges. A person\r\nof the name of Aubrey had a case depending in Chancery. He had been\r\nalmost ruined by law-expenses, and his patience had been exhausted by\r\nthe delays of the court. He received a hint from some of the hangers-on\r\nof the Chancellor that a present of one hundred pounds would expedite\r\nmatters. The poor man had not the sum required. However, having found\r\nout an usurer who accommodated him with it at high interest, he carried\r\nit to York House. The Chancellor took the money, and his dependents\r\nassured the suitor that all would go right. Aubrey was, however,\r\ndisappointed; for, after considerable delay, “a killing decree” was\r\npronounced against him. Another suitor of the name of Egerton complained\r\nthat he had been induced by two of the Chancellor’s jackals to make his\r\nLordship a present of four hundred pounds, and that, nevertheless, he\r\nhad not been able to obtain a decree in his favour. The evidence to\r\nthese facts was overwhelming. Bacon’s friends could only entreat the\r\nHouse to suspend its judgment, and to send up the case to the Lords,\r\nin a form less offensive than an impeachment. {414}On the nineteenth\r\nof March the King; sent a message to the Commons, expressing his deep\r\nregret that so eminent a person as the Chancellor should be suspected\r\nof misconduct. His Majesty declared that he had no wish to screen the\r\nguilty from justice, and proposed to appoint a new kind of tribunal,\r\nconsisting of eighteen commissioners, who might be chosen from among the\r\nmembers of the two Houses, to investigate the matter. The Commons were\r\nnot disposed to depart from their regular course of proceeding. On the\r\nsame day they held a conference with the Lords, and delivered in the\r\nheads of the accusation against the Chancellor. At this conference Bacon\r\nwas not present. Overwhelmed with shame and remorse, and abandoned by\r\nall those in whom he had weakly put his trust, he had shut himself up in\r\nhis chamber from the eyes of men. The dejection of his mind soon\r\ndisordered his body. Buckingham, who visited him by the King’s order,\r\n“found his Lordship very sick and heavy.” It appears from a pathetic\r\nletter which the unhappy man addressed to the Peers on the day of the\r\nconference, that he neither expected nor wished to survive his disgrace.\r\nDuring several days he remained in his bed, refusing to see any human\r\nbeing. He passionately told his attendants to leave him, to forget him,\r\nnever again to name his name, never to remember that there had been such\r\na man in the world. In the mean time, fresh instances of corruption were\r\nevery day brought to the knowledge of his accusers. The number of\r\ncharges rapidly increased from two to twenty-three. The Lords entered on\r\nthe investigation of the case with laudable alacrity. Some witnesses\r\nwere examined at the bar of the House. A select committee was appointed\r\nto take the depositions {415}of others; and the inquiry was rapidly\r\nproceeding, when, on the twenty-sixth of March, the King adjourned the\r\nParliament for three weeks.\r\n\r\nThis measure revived Bacon’s hopes. He made the most of his short\r\nrespite. He attempted to work on the feeble mind of the King. He\r\nappealed to all the strongest feelings of James, to his fears, to his\r\nvanity, to his high notions of prerogative. Would the Solomon of the\r\nage commit so gross an error as to encourage the encroaching spirit of\r\nParliaments? Would God’s anointed, accountable to God alone, pay homage\r\nto the clamorous multitude? “Those,” exclaimed Bacon, “who now strike at\r\nthe Chancellor will soon strike at the Crown. I am the first sacrifice.\r\nI wish I may be the last.” But all his eloquence and address were\r\nemployed in vain. Indeed, whatever Mr. Montagu may say, we are firmly\r\nconvinced that it was not in the King’s power to save Bacon, without\r\nhaving recourse to measures which would have convulsed the realm. The\r\nCrown had not sufficient influence over the Parliament to procure an\r\nacquittal in so clear a case of guilt. And to dissolve a Parliament\r\nwhich is universally allowed to have been one of the best Parliaments\r\nthat ever sat, which had acted liberally and respectfully towards the\r\nSovereign, and which enjoyed in the highest degree the favour of the\r\npeople, only in order to stop a grave, temperate, and constitutional\r\ninquiry into the personal integrity of the first judge in the kingdom,\r\nwould have been a measure more scandalous and absurd than any of those\r\nwhich were the ruin of the House of Stuart. Such a measure, while it\r\nwould have been as fatal to the Chancellor’s honour as a conviction,\r\nwould have endangered the very existence of the monarchy. The {416}King,\r\nacting by the advice of Williams, very properly refused to engage in a\r\ndangerous struggle with his people, for the purpose of saving from legal\r\ncondemnation a minister whom it was impossible to save from dishonour.\r\nHe advised Bacon to plead guilty, and promised to do all in his power to\r\nmitigate the punishment. Mr. Montagu is exceedingly angry with James\r\non this account. But though we are, in general, very little inclined to\r\nadmire that Prince’s conduct, we really think that his advice was, under\r\nall the circumstances, the best advice that could have been given.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of April the Houses reassembled, and the Lords\r\nresumed their inquiries into the abuses of the Court of Chancery. On the\r\ntwenty-second, Bacon addressed to the Peers a letter, which the\r\nPrince of Wales condescended to deliver. In this artful and pathetic\r\ncomposition, the Chancellor acknowledged his guilt in guarded and\r\ngeneral texans, and, while acknowledging, endeavoured to palliate it.\r\nThis, however, was not thought sufficient by his judges. They required\r\na more particular confession, and sent him a copy of the charges. On\r\nthe thirtieth, he delivered a paper in which he admitted, with few and\r\nunimportant reservations, the truth of the accusations brought against\r\nhim, and threw himself entirely on the mercy of his peers. “Upon\r\nadvised consideration of the charges,” said he, “descending into my own\r\nconscience, and calling my memory to account so far as I am able, I do\r\nplainly and ingenuously confess that I am guilty of corruption, and do\r\nrenounce all defence.”\r\n\r\nThe Lords came to a resolution that the Chancellor’s confession appeared\r\nto be full and ingenuous, and sent a committee to inquire of him whether\r\nit was {417}really subscribed by himself. The deputies, among whom was\r\nSouthampton, the common friend, many years before, of Bacon and Essex,\r\nperformed their duty with great delicacy. Indeed the agonies of such\r\na mind and the degradation of such a name might well have softened the\r\nmost obdurate natures. “My Lords,” said Bacon, “it is my act, my hand,\r\nmy heart. I beseech your Lordships to be merciful to a broken reed.”\r\n They withdrew; and he again retired to his chamber in the deepest\r\ndejection. The next day, the sergeant-at-arms and the usher of the House\r\nof Lords came to conduct him to Westminster Hall, where sentence was to\r\nbe pronounced. But they found him so unwell that he could not leave his\r\nbed; and this excuse for his absence was readily accepted. In no\r\nquarter does there appear to have been the smallest desire to add to his\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nThe sentence was, however, severe, the more severe, no doubt, because\r\nthe Lords knew that it would not be executed, and that they had an\r\nexcellent opportunity of exhibiting, at small cost, the inflexibility of\r\ntheir justice, and their abhorrence of corruption. Bacon was condemned\r\nto pay a fine of forty thousand pounds, and to be imprisoned in the\r\nTower during the King’s pleasure. He was declared incapable of holding\r\nany office in the State or of sitting in Parliament; and he was banished\r\nfor life from the verge of the court. In such misery and shame ended\r\nthat long career of worldly wisdom and worldly prosperity.\r\n\r\nEven at this pass Mr. Montagu does not desert his hero. He seems indeed\r\nto think that the attachment of an editor ought to be as devoted as that\r\nof Mr. Moore’s lovers; and cannot conceive what biography {418}was made\r\nfor,\r\n\r\n                             “if ’tis not the same\r\n\r\n               Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame.”\r\n\r\nHe assures us that Bacon was innocent, that, he had the means of making\r\na perfectly satisfactory defence, that when he “plainly and ingenuously\r\nconfessed that he was guilty of corruption,” and when he afterwards\r\nsolemnly affirmed that his confession was “his act, his hand, his\r\nheart,” he was telling a great lie, and that he refrained from bringing\r\nforward proofs of his innocence, because he durst not disobey the King\r\nand the favourite, who, for his own selfish objects, pressed him to\r\nplead guilty.\r\n\r\nNow, in the first place, there is not the smallest reason to believe\r\nthat, if James and Buckingham had thought that Bacon had a good defence,\r\nthey would have prevented him from making it. What conceivable motive\r\nhad they for doing so? Mr. Montagu perpetually repeats that it was their\r\ninterest to sacrifice Bacon. But he overlooks an obvious distinction. It\r\nwas their interest to sacrifice Bacon on the supposition of his guilt;\r\nbut not on the supposition of his innocence. James was very properly\r\nunwilling to run the risk of protecting his Chancellor against the\r\nParliament. But if the Chancellor had been able, by force of argument,\r\nto obtain an acquittal from the Parliament, we have no doubt that both\r\nthe King and Villiers would have heartily rejoiced. They would have\r\nrejoiced, not merely on account of their friendship for Bacon, which\r\nseems, however, to have been as sincere as most friendships of that\r\nsort, but on selfish grounds. Nothing could have strengthened the\r\ngovernment more than such a victory. The King and the favourite\r\nabandoned the Chancellor because they were unable to avert his disgrace,\r\nand unwilling to share it. Mr. Montagu mistakes effect for cause.\r\n{419}He thinks that Bacon did not prove his innocence, because he was\r\nnot supported by the Court. The truth evidently is that the Court did\r\nnot venture to support Bacon, because he could not prove his innocence.\r\n\r\nAgain, it seems strange that Mr. Montagu should not perceive that, while\r\nattempting to vindicate Bacon’s reputation, he is really casting on\r\nit the foulest of all aspersions. He imputes to his idol a degree of\r\nmeanness and depravity more loathsome than judicial corruption itself.\r\nA corrupt judge may have many good qualities. But a man who, to please a\r\npowerful patron, solemnly declares himself guilty of corruption when\r\nhe knows himself to be innocent, must be a monster of servility and\r\nimpudence. Bacon was, to say nothing of his highest claims to respect,\r\na gentleman, a nobleman, a scholar, a statesman, a man of the first\r\nconsideration in society, a man far advanced in years. Is it possible to\r\nbelieve that such a man would, to gratify any human being, irreparably\r\nruin his own character by his own act? Imagine a grey-headed judge,\r\nfrill of years and honours, owning with tears, with pathetic assurances\r\nof his penitence and of his sincerity, that he has been guilty of\r\nshameful mal-practices, repeatedly asseverating the truth of his\r\nconfession, subscribing it with his own band, submitting to conviction,\r\nreceiving a humiliating sentence and acknowledging its justice, and\r\nall this when he has it in his power to show that his conduct has been\r\nirreproachable! The thing is incredible. But if we admit it to be true,\r\nwhat must we think of such a man, if indeed be deserves the name of man,\r\nwho thinks any thing that kings and minions can bestow more precious\r\nthan honour, or any thing that they can inflict more terrible than\r\ninfamy? {420}Of this most disgraceful imputation we fully acquit Bacon.\r\nHe had no defence; and Mr. Montagu’s affectionate attempt to make a\r\ndefence for him has altogether failed.\r\n\r\nThe grounds on which Mr. Montagu rests the case are two; the first, that\r\nthe taking of presents was usual, and, what he seems to consider as the\r\nsame thing, not discreditable; the second, that these presents were not\r\ntaken as bribes.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu brings forward many facts in support of his first\r\nproposition. He is not content with showing that many English judges\r\nformerly received gifts from suitors, but collects similar instances\r\nfrom foreign nations and ancient times. He goes back to the\r\ncommonwealths of Greece, and attempts to press into his service a line\r\nof Homer and a sentence of Plutarch, which, we fear, will hardly serve\r\nhis turn. The gold of which Homer speaks was not intended to fee the\r\njudges, but was paid into court for the benefit of the successful\r\nlitigant; and the gratuities which Pericles, as Plutarch states,\r\ndistributed among the members of the Athenian tribunals, were legal\r\nwages paid out of the public revenue. We can supply Mr. Montagu with\r\npassages much more in point. Hesiod, who like poor Aubrey, had a\r\n“killing decree” made against him in the Chancery of Ascra, forgot\r\ndecorum so far that he ventured to designate the learned persons who\r\npresided in that court, as [Greek] Plutarch and Diodorus have handed\r\ndown to the latest ages the respectable name of Anytus, the son of\r\nAnthemion, the first defendant who, eluding all the safeguards which\r\nthe ingenuity of Solon could devise, succeeded in corrupting a bench of\r\nAthenian judges. We are indeed so far from grudging Mr. Montagu the\r\naid of Greece, that we will {421}give him Rome into the bargain. We\r\nacknowledge that the honourable senators who tried Verres received\r\npresents which were worth more than the fee-simple of York House and\r\nGorhambury together, and that the no less honorable senators and knights\r\nwho professed to believe in the _alibi_ of Clodius obtained marks still\r\nmore extraordinary of the esteem and gratitude of the defendant. In\r\nshort, we are ready to admit that, before Bacon’s time, and in Bacon’s\r\ntime, judges were in the habit of receiving gifts from suitors.\r\n\r\nBut is this a defence? We think not. The robberies of Cacus and Barabbas\r\nare no apology for those of Turpin. The conduct of the two men of Belial\r\nwho swore away the life of Naboth has never been cited as an excuse for\r\nthe perjuries of Oates and Dangerfield. Mr. Montagu has confounded two\r\nthings which it is necessary carefully to distinguish from each other,\r\nif we wish to form a correct judgment of the characters of men of other\r\ncountries and other times. That an immoral action is, in a particular\r\nsociety, generally considered as innocent, is a good plea for an\r\nindividual who, being one of that society, and having adopted the\r\nnotions which prevail among his neighbors, commits that action. But the\r\ncircumstance that a great many people are in the habit of committing\r\nimmoral actions is no plea at all. We should think it unjust to call St.\r\nLouis a wicked man, because in an age in which toleration was generally\r\nregarded as a sin, he persecuted heretics. We should think it unjust to\r\ncall Cowper’s friend, John Newton, a hypocrite and monster, because at\r\na time when the slave-trade was commonly considered by the most\r\nrespectable people as an innocent and beneficial traffic, he went,\r\nlargely provided with hymn-books and handcuffs on a Guinea {422}voyage.\r\nBut the circumstance that there are twenty thousand thieves in London,\r\nis no excuse for a fellow who is caught breaking into a shop. No man is\r\nto be blamed for not making discoveries in morality, for not finding\r\nout that something which everybody else thinks to be good is really bad.\r\nBut, if a man does that which he and all around him know to be bad, it\r\nis no excuse for him that many others have done the same. We should be\r\nashamed of spending so much time in pointing out so clear a distinction,\r\nbut that Mr. Montagu seems altogether to overlook it.\r\n\r\nNow to apply these principles to the case before us; let Mr. Montagu\r\nprove that, in Bacon’s age, the practices for which Bacon was punished\r\nwere generally considered as innocent; and we admit that he has made out\r\nhis point. But this we defy him to do. That these practices were common\r\nwe admit. But they were common just as all wickedness to which there is\r\nstrong temptation always was and always will be common. They were common\r\njust as theft, cheating, perjury, adultery have always been common. They\r\nwere common, not because people did not know what was right, but because\r\npeople liked to do what was wrong. They were common, though prohibited\r\nby law. They were common, though condemned by public opinion. They\r\nwere common, because in that age law and public opinion united had not\r\nsufficient force to restrain the greediness of powerful and unprincipled\r\nmagistrates. They were common, as every crime will be common when the\r\ngain to which it leads is great, and the chance of punishment small.\r\nBut, though common, they were universally allowed to be altogether\r\nunjustifiable; they were in the highest degree odious; and, though many\r\nwere guilty of them, none had the audacity publicly to avow and defend\r\nthem. {423}We could give a thousand proofs that the opinion then\r\nentertained concerning these practices was such as we have described.\r\nBut we will content ourselves with calling; a single witness, honest\r\nHugh Latimer. His sermons, preached more than seventy years before\r\nthe inquiry into Bacon’s conduct, abound with the sharpest invectives\r\nagainst those very practices of which Bacon was guilty, and which, as\r\nMr. Montagu seems to think, nobody ever considered as blamable till\r\nBacon was punished for them. We could easily fill twenty pages with the\r\nhomely, but just and forcible rhetoric of the brave old bishop. We shall\r\nselect a few passages as fair specimens, and no more than fair specimens\r\nof the rest. “_Omnes diligunt munera_. They all love bribes. Bribery is\r\na princely kind of thieving. They will be waged by the rich, either to\r\ngive sentence against the poor, or to put off the poor man’s cause. This\r\nis the noble theft of princes and magistrates. They are bribe-takers.\r\nNowadays they call them gentle rewards. Let them leave their colouring,\r\nand call them by their Christian name--bribes.” And again; “Cambyses\r\nwas a great emperor, such another as our master is. He had many lord\r\ndeputies, lord presidents, and lieutenants under him. It is a great\r\nwhile ago since I read the history. It chanced he had under him in one\r\nof his dominions a briber, a gift-taker, a gratifier of rich men; he\r\nfollowed gifts as fast as he that followed the pudding, a handmaker in\r\nhis office to make his son a great man, as the old saying is: Happy is\r\nthe child whose father goeth to the devil. The cry of the poor widow\r\ncame to the emperor’s ear, and caused him to flay the judge quick, and\r\nlaid his skin in the chair of judgment, that all judges that should give\r\njudgment afterward should sit in the same skin. Surely it was {424}a\r\ngoodly sign, a goodly monument, the sign of the judge’s skin. I pray God\r\nwe may once see the skin in England.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure,” says he in another sermon, “this is _scala inferni_, the\r\nright way to hell, to be covetous, to take bribes, and pervert justice.\r\nIf a judge should ask me the way to hell, I would show him this way.\r\nFirst, let him be a covetous man; let his heart be poisoned with\r\ncovetousness. Then let him go a little further and take bribes; and,\r\nlastly, pervert judgment. Lo, here is the mother, and the daughter,\r\nand the daughter’s daughter. Avarice is the mother: she brings forth\r\nbribe-taking, and bribe-taking perverting of judgment. There lacks\r\na fourth thing to make up the mess, which, so help me God, if I were\r\njudge, should be _hanyum tuum_, a Tyburn tippet to take with him; an it\r\nwere the judge of the King’s Bench, my Lord Chief Judge of England,\r\nyea, an it were my Lord Chancellor himself, to Tyburn with him.” We will\r\nquote but one more passage. “He that took the silver basin and ewer for\r\na bribe, thinketh that it will never come out. But he may now know that\r\nI know it, and I know it not alone; there be more beside me that know\r\nit. Oh, briber and bribery! He was never a good man that will so take\r\nbribes. Nor can I believe that he that is a briber will be a good\r\njustice. It will never be merry in England till we have the skins of\r\nsuch. For what needeth bribing where men do their things uprightly?”\r\n\r\nThis was not the language of a great philosopher who had made new\r\ndiscoveries in moral and political science. It was the plain talk of\r\na plain man, who sprang from the body of the people, who sympathised\r\nstrongly with their wants and their feelings, and who boldly uttered\r\ntheir opinions. It was on account of the {425}fearless way in which\r\nstout-hearted old Hugh exposed the misdeeds of men in ermine tippets\r\nand gold collars, that the Londoners cheered him, as he walked down the\r\nStrand to preach at Whitehall, struggled for a touch of his gown, and\r\nbawled “Have at them, Father Latimer.” It is plain, from the passages\r\nwhich we have quoted, and from fifty others winch we might quote, that,\r\nlong before Bacon was born, the accepting of presents by a judge was\r\nknown to be a wicked and shameful act, that the fine words under which\r\nit was the fashion to veil such corrupt practices were even then seen\r\nthrough by the common people, that the distinction on which Mr. Montagu\r\ninsists between compliments and bribes was even then laughed at as\r\na mere colouring. There may be some oratorical exaggeration in what\r\nLatimer says about the Tyburn tippet and the sign of the judge’s\r\nskin; but the fact that he ventured to use such expressions is amply\r\nsufficient to prove that the gift-taking judges, the receivers of silver\r\nbasins and ewers, were regarded as such pests of the commonwealth that\r\na venerable divine might, without any breach of Christian charity,\r\npublicly pray to God for their detection and their condign punishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu tells us, most justly, that we ought not to transfer the\r\nopinions of our age to a former age. But he has himself committed a\r\ngreater error than that against which he has cautioned his readers.\r\nWithout any evidence, nay, in the face of the strongest evidence, he\r\nascribes to the people of a former age a set of opinions which no people\r\never held. But any hypothesis is in his view more probable than that\r\nBacon should have been a dishonest man. We firmly believe that, if\r\npapers were to be discovered which should irresistibly prove that Bacon\r\nwas concerned in the poisoning of {426}Sir Thomas Overbury, Mr. Montagu\r\nwould tell us that, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, it\r\nwas not thought improper in a man to put arsenic into the broth of his\r\nfriends, and that we ought to blame, not Bacon, but the age in which he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nBut why should we have recourse to any other evidence, when the\r\nproceeding against Lord Bacon is itself the best evidence on the\r\nsubject? When Mr. Montagu tells us that we ought not to transfer the\r\nopinions of our age to Bacon’s age, he appears altogether to forget\r\nthat it was by men of Bacon’s own age that Bacon was prosecuted, tried,\r\nconvicted, and sentenced. Did not they know what their own opinions\r\nwere? Did not they know whether they thought the taking of gifts by\r\na judge a crime or not? Mr. Montagu complains bitterly that Bacon\r\nwas induced to abstain from making a defence. But, if Bacon’s defence\r\nresembled that which is made for him in the volume before us, it would\r\nhave been unnecessary to trouble the Houses with it. The Lords and\r\nCommons did not want Bacon to tell them the thoughts of their own\r\nhearts, to inform them that they did not consider such practices as\r\nthose in which they had detected him as at all culpable. Mr. Montagu’s\r\nproposition may indeed be fairly stated thus:--It was very hard that\r\nBacon’s contemporaries should think it wrong in him to do what thev\r\ndid not think it wrong in him to do. Third indeed; and withal somewhat\r\nimprobable. Will any person say that the Commons who impeached Bacon for\r\ntaking presents, and the Lords who sentenced him to fine, imprisonment,\r\nand degradation for taking presents, did not know that the taking of\r\npresents was a crime? Or, will any person say that Bacon did not know\r\nwhat the whole House of Commons and the {427}whole House of Lords knew?\r\nNobody who is not prepared to maintain one of these absurd propositions\r\ncan deny that Bacon committed what he knew to be a crime.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be pretended that the Houses were seeking occasion to ruin\r\nBacon, and that they therefore brought him to punishment on charges\r\nwhich they themselves knew to be frivolous. In no quarter was there the\r\nfaintest indication of a disposition to treat him harshly. Through\r\nthe whole proceeding there was no symptom of personal animosity or of\r\nfactious violence in either House. Indeed, we will venture to say that\r\nno State-Trial in our history is more creditable to all who took part\r\nin it, either as prosecutors or judges. The decency, the gravity, the\r\npublic spirit, the justice moderated but not unnerved by compassion,\r\nwhich appeared in every part of the transaction, would do honour to the\r\nmost respectable public men in our own times. The accusers, while they\r\ndischarged their duty to their constituents by bringing the misdeeds\r\nof the Chancellor to light, spoke with admiration of his many eminent\r\nqualities. The Lords, while condemning him, complimented him on the\r\ningenuousness of his confession, and spared him the humiliation of a\r\npublic appearance at their bar. So strong was the contagion of good\r\nfeeling that even Sir Edward Coke, for the first time in his life,\r\nbehaved like a gentleman. No criminal ever had more temperate\r\nprosecutors than Bacon. No criminal ever had more favourable judges. If\r\nhe was convicted, it was because it was impossible to acquit him without\r\noffering the grossest outrage to justice and common sense.\r\n\r\nMr. Montagu’s other argument, namely, that Bacon, though he took\r\ngifts, did not take bribes, seems to us as futile as that which we have\r\nconsidered. Indeed, {428}we might be content to leave it to be answered\r\nby the plainest man among our readers. Demosthenes noticed it with\r\ncontempt more than two thousand years ago. Latimer, we have seen,\r\ntreated this sophistry with similar disdain. “Leave colouring,” said\r\nhe, “and call these things by their Christian name, bribes.” Mr. Montagu\r\nattempts, somewhat unfairly, we must say, to represent the presents\r\nwhich Bacon received as similar to the perquisites which suitors paid\r\nto the members of the Parliaments of France. The French magistrate had a\r\nlegal right to his fee: and the amount of the fee was regulated by law.\r\nWhether this be a good mode of remunerating judges is not the question.\r\nBut what analogy is there between payments of this sort and the presents\r\nwhich Bacon received, presents which were not sanctioned by the law,\r\nwhich were not made under the public eye, and of which the amount was\r\nregulated only by private bargain between the magistrate and the suitor?\r\n\r\nAgain, it is mere trifling to say that Bacon could not have meant to\r\nact corruptly because he employed the agency of men of rank, of bishops,\r\nprivy councillors, and members of Parliament; as if the whole history of\r\nthat generation was not full of the low actions of high people; as if it\r\nwas not notorious that men, as exalted in rank as any of the decoys that\r\nBacon employed, had pimped for Somerset and poisoned Overbury.\r\n\r\nBut, says Mr. Montagu, these presents “were made openly and with the\r\ngreatest publicity.” This would indeed be a strong argument in favour of\r\nBacon. But we deny the fact. In one, and one only, of the cases in which\r\nBacon was accused of corruptly receiving gifts, does he appear to have\r\nreceived a gift publicly. This was in a matter depending between the\r\nCompany {429}of Apothecaries and the Company of Grocers. Bacon, in his\r\nConfession, insisted strongly on the circumstance that he had on this\r\noccasion taken a present publicly, as a proof that he had not taken it\r\ncorruptly. Is it not clear that, if he had taken the presents mentioned\r\nin the other charges in the same public manner, he would have dwelt on\r\nthis point in his answer to those charges? The fact that he insists\r\nso strongly on the publicity of one particular present is of itself\r\nsufficient to prove that the other presents were not publicly taken. Why\r\nhe took this present publicly and the rest secretly, is evident. He on\r\nthat occasion acted openly, because he was acting honestly. He was\r\nnot on that occasion sitting judicially. He was called in to effect an\r\namicable arrangement between two parties. Both were satisfied with his\r\ndecision. Both joined in making him a present in return for his trouble.\r\nWhether it was quite delicate in a man of his rank to accept a present\r\nunder such circumstances, may be questioned. But there is no ground in\r\nthis case for accusing him of corruption.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the very circumstances which prove him to have been innocent\r\nin this case prove him to have been guilty on the other charges. Once,\r\nand once only, he alleges that he received a present publicly. The\r\nnatural inference is that in all the other cases mentioned in the\r\narticles against him he received presents secretly. When we examine the\r\nsingle case in which he alleges that he received a present publicly,\r\nwe find that it is also the single case in which there was no gross\r\nimpropriety in his receiving a present. Is it then possible to doubt\r\nthat his reason for not receiving other presents in as public a manner\r\nwas that he knew that it was wrong to receive them?\r\n\r\nOne argument still remains, plausible in appearance. {430}but admitting\r\nof easy and complete refutation. The two chief complainants, Aubrey and\r\nEgerton, had both made presents to the Chancellor. But he had decided\r\nagainst them both. Therefore, he had not received those presents as\r\nbribes. “The complaints of his accusers were,” says Mr. Montagu, “not\r\nthat the gratuities had, but that they had not influenced Bacon’s\r\njudgment, as he had decided against them.”\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that it is precisely in this way that an extensive system\r\nof corruption is generally detected. A person who, by a bribe, has\r\nprocured a decree in his favour, is by no means likely to come forward\r\nof his own accord as an accuser. He is content. He has his quid pro\r\nquo. He is not impelled either by interested or by vindictive motives to\r\nbring the transaction before the public. On the contrary, he has almost\r\nas strong motives for holding his tongue as the judge himself can have.’\r\nBut when a judge practises corruption, as we fear that Bacon practised\r\nit, on a large scale, and has many agents looking out in different\r\nquarters for prey, it will sometimes happen that he will be bribed on\r\nboth sides. It will sometimes happen that he will receive money from\r\nsuitors who are so obviously in the wrong that he cannot with decency\r\ndo any thing to serve them. Thus lie will now and then be forced to\r\npronounce against a person from whom he has received a present; and he\r\nmakes that person a deadly enemy. The hundreds who have got what they\r\npaid for remain quiet. It is the two or three who have paid, and have\r\nnothing to show for their money, who are noisy.\r\n\r\nThe memorable case of the Goëzmans is an example of this. Beaumarchais\r\nhad an important suit depending before the Parliament of Paris. M.\r\nGoëzman was the judge on whom chiefly the decision depended. It {431}was\r\nhinted to Beaumarchais that Madame Goëzman might be propitiated by\r\na present. He accordingly offered a purse of gold to the lady, who\r\nreceived it graciously. There can be no doubt that, if the decision of\r\nthe court had been favourable to him, these things would never have been\r\nknown to the world.\r\n\r\nBut he lost his cause. Almost the whole sum which he had expended in\r\nbribery was immediately refunded; and those who had disappointed him\r\nprobably thought that he would not, for the mere gratification of\r\nhis malevolence, make public a transaction which was discreditable to\r\nhimself as well as to them. They knew little of him. He soon taught\r\nthem to curse the day in which they had dared to trifle with a man of so\r\nrevengeful and turbulent a spirit, of such dauntless effrontery, and\r\nof such eminent talents for controversy and satire. He compelled the\r\nParliament to put a degrading stigma on M. Goëzman. He drove\r\nMadame Goëzman to a convent. Till it was too late, his excited\r\npassions did not suffer him to remember that he could effect their ruin\r\nonly by disclosures ruinous to himself. We could give other instances.\r\nBut it is needless. No person well acquainted with human nature can fail\r\nto perceive that, if the doctrine for which Mr. Montagu contends were\r\nadmitted, society would be deprived of almost the only chance which it\r\nhas of detecting the corrupt practices of judges.\r\n\r\nWe return to our narrative. The sentence of Bacon had scarcely been\r\npronounced when it was mitigated. He was indeed sent to the Tower. But\r\nthis was merely a form. In two days he was set at liberty, and soon\r\nafter he retired to Gorhambury. His fine was speedily released by the\r\nCrown. He was next suffered to present himself at Court; and at length,\r\nin 1624, the {432}rest of his punishment was remitted. He was now at\r\nliberty to resume his seat in the House of Lords, and he was actually\r\nsummoned to the next Parliament. But age, infirmity, and perhaps shame,\r\nprevented him from attending. The Government allowed him a pension of\r\ntwelve hundred pounds a year; and his whole annual income is estimated\r\nby Mr. Montagu at two thousand five hundred pounds, a sum which was\r\nprobably above the average income of a nobleman of that generation,\r\nand which was certainly sufficient for comfort and even for splendour.\r\nUnhappily, Bacon was fond of display, and unused to pay minute attention\r\nto domestic affairs. He was not easily persuaded to give up any part\r\nof the magnificence to which he had been accustomed in the time of his\r\npower and prosperity. No pressure of distress could induce him to part\r\nwith the woods of Gorhambury. “I will not,” he said, “be stripped of\r\nmy feathers.” He travelled with so splendid an equipage and so large\r\na retinue that Prince Charles, who once fell in with him on the road,\r\nexclaimed with surprise, “Well; do what we can, this man scorns to\r\ngo out in snuff.” This carelessness and ostentation reduced Bacon to\r\nfrequent distress. He was under the necessity of parting with York\r\nHouse, and of taking up his residence, during his visits to London, at\r\nhis old chambers in Gray’s Inn. He had other vexations, the exact nature\r\nof which is unknown. It is evident from his will that some part of his\r\nwife’s conduct had greatly disturbed and irritated him.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever might be his pecuniary difficulties or his conjugal\r\ndiscomforts, the powers of his intellect still remained undiminished.\r\nThose noble studies for which he had found leisure in the midst of\r\nprofessional drudgery and of courtly intrigues gave to this last sad\r\nstage of {433}his life a dignity beyond what power or titles could\r\nbestow. Impeached, convicted, sentenced, driven with ignominy from the\r\npresence of his Sovereign, shut out from the deliberations of his fellow\r\nnobles, loaded with debt, branded with dishonour, sinking under the\r\nweight of years, sorrows, and diseases, Bacon was Bacon still. “My\r\nconceit of his person,” says Ben Jonson very finely, “was never\r\nincreased towards him by his place or honours; but I have and do\r\nreverence him for the greatness that was only proper to himself; in\r\nthat he seemed to me ever, by his work, one of the greatest men and most\r\nworthy of admiration, that had been in many ages. In his adversity I\r\never prayed that God would give him strength; for greatness he could not\r\nwant.”\r\n\r\nThe services which Bacon rendered to letters during the last five years\r\nof his life, amidst ten thousand distractions and vexations, increase\r\nthe regret with which we think on the many years which he had wasted, to\r\nuse the words of Sir Thomas Bodley, “on such study as was not worthy of\r\nsuch a student.” He commenced a Digest of the Laws of England, a History\r\nof England under the Princes of the House of Tudor, a body of Natural\r\nHistory, a Philosophical Romance. He made extensive and valuable\r\nadditions to his Essays. He published the inestimable Treatise _De\r\nAugmentis Scientiarum_. The very trifles with which he amused himself in\r\nhours of pain and languor bore the mark of his mind. The best collection\r\nof jests in the world is that which he dictated from memory, without\r\nreferring to any book, on a day on which illness had rendered him\r\nincapable of serious study.\r\n\r\nThe great apostle of experimental philosophy was {434}destined to be its\r\nmartyr. It had occurred to him that snow might be used with advantage\r\nfor the purpose of preventing animal substances from putrefying. On a\r\nvery cold day, early in the spring of the year 1626, he alighted from\r\nhis coach near Highgate, in order to try the experiment. He went into\r\na cottage, bought a fowl, and with his own hands stuffed it with\r\nsnow. While thus engaged he felt a sudden chill, and was soon so much\r\nindisposed that it was impossible for him to return to Gray’s Inn.\r\nThe Earl of Arundel, with whom he was well acquainted, had a house at\r\nHighgate. To that house Bacon was carried. The Earl was absent; but\r\nthe servants who were in charge of the place showed great respect and\r\nattention to the illustrious guest. Here, after an illness of about\r\na week, he expired early on the morning of Easter-day, 1626. His mind\r\nappears to have retained its strength and liveliness to the end. He did\r\nnot forget the fowl which had caused his death. In the last letter that\r\nhe ever wrote, with fingers which, as he said, could not steadily hold\r\na pen, he did not omit to mention that the experiment of the snow had\r\nsucceeded “excellently well.”\r\n\r\nOur opinion of the moral character of this great man has already been\r\nsufficiently explained. Had his life been passed in literary retirement,\r\nhe would, in all probability, have deserved to be considered, not only\r\nas a great philosopher, but as a worthy and good-natured member of\r\nsociety. But neither his principles nor his spirit were such as could\r\nbe trusted, when strong temptations were to be resisted, and serious\r\ndangers to be braved.\r\n\r\nIn his will he expressed with singular brevity, energy, dignity, and\r\npathos, a mournful consciousness {435}that his actions had not been such\r\nas to entitle him to the esteem of those under whose observation his\r\nlife had been passed, and, at the same time, a proud confidence that\r\nhis writings had secured for him a high and permanent place among the\r\nbenefactors of mankind. So at least we understand those striking words\r\nwhich have been often quoted, but which we must quote once more; “For my\r\nname and memory, I leave it to men’s charitable speeches, and to foreign\r\nnations, and to the next age.”\r\n\r\nHis confidence was just. From the day of his death his fame has been\r\nconstantly and steadily progressive; and we have no doubt that his name\r\nwill be named with reverence to the latest ages, and to the remotest\r\nends of the civilised world.\r\n\r\nThe chief peculiarity of Bacon’s philosophy seems to us to have been\r\nthis, that it aimed at things altogether different from those which\r\nhis predecessors had proposed to themselves. This was his own opinion.\r\n“Finis scientiarum,” says he, “a nemine adhuc bene positus est.” (1)\r\nAnd again, “Omnium gravissimus error in deviatione ab ultimo doctrinarum\r\nfine con-sistit.” (2) “Nec ipsa meta,” says he elsewhere, “adhuc ulli,\r\nquod sciam, mortalium posita est et defixa.” (3) The more carefully his\r\nworks are examined, the more clearly, we think, it will appear that this\r\nis the real clue to his whole system, and that he used means different\r\nfrom those used by other philosophers, because he wished to arrive at an\r\nend altogether different from theirs.\r\n\r\nWhat then was the end which Bacon proposed to himself? It was, to use\r\nhis own emphatic expression,\r\n\r\n     (1) Novum Organum, Lib. 1. Aph. 81.\r\n\r\n     (2) De Augmentis, Lib. 1.\r\n\r\n     (3) Cogitata et visa.\r\n\r\n{436}“fruit.” It was the multiplying of human enjoyments and the\r\nmitigating of human sufferings. It was “the relief of man’s estate.” (1)\r\nIt was “commodis humanis inservire.” (2) It was “efficaciter operari\r\nad sublevanda vitæ humanæ incommoda.” (3) It was “dotare vitam immanam\r\nnovis inventis et copiis.” (4) It was “genus humanum novis operibus\r\net potestatibus continno dotare.” (5) This was the object of all his\r\nspeculations in every department of science, in natural philosophy, in\r\nlegislation, in politics, in morals.\r\n\r\nTwo words form the key of the Baconian doctrine, Utility and Progress.\r\nThe ancient philosophy disdained to be useful, and was content to be\r\nstationary. It dealt largely in theories of moral perfection, which were\r\nso sublime that they never could be more than theories; in attempts\r\nto solve insoluble enigmas; in exhortations to the attainment of\r\nunattainable frames of mind. It could not condescend to the humble\r\noffice of ministering to the comfort of human beings. All the schools\r\ncontemned that office as degrading; some censured it as immoral. Once\r\nindeed Posidonius, a distinguished writer of the age of Cicero and\r\nCæsar, so far forgot himself as to enumerate, among the hum-bier\r\nblessings which mankind owed to philosophy, the discovery of the\r\nprinciple of the arch, and the introduction of the use of metals.\r\nThis eulogy was considered as an affront, and was taken up with proper\r\nspirit. Seneca vehemently disclaims these insulting compliments.6\r\nPhilosophy, according to him, has nothing to do with teaching men to\r\nrear arched roofs over their heads. The true philosopher does not care\r\n\r\n     1 Advancement of Learning, Book 1.\r\n\r\n     2 De Angmentis, Lib. 7. C:ip. 1.\r\n\r\n     3 Ib. Lib. 2. Cap. 2.\r\n\r\n     4 Novum Organum, Lib. 1. Aph. 81.\r\n\r\n     5 Cogilata el ma.\r\n\r\n     6 Seneca, Epist. 90.\r\n\r\n{437}whether he has an arched roof or any roof. Philosophy has nothing\r\nto do with teaching men the uses of metals. She teaches us to be\r\nindependent of all material substances, of all mechanical contrivances.\r\nThe wise man lives according; to nature. Instead of attempting to add\r\nto the physical comforts of his species, he regrets that his lot was not\r\ncast in that golden age when the human race had no protection against\r\nthe cold but the skins of wild beasts, no screen from the sun but\r\na cavern. To impute to such a man any share in the invention or\r\nimprovement of a plough, a ship, or a mill, is an insult. “In my\r\nown time,” says Seneca, “there have been inventions of this sort,\r\ntransparent windows, tubes for diffusing warmth equally through all\r\nparts of a building, short-hand, which has been carried to such a\r\nperfection that a writer can keep pace with the most rapid speaker.\r\nBut the inventing of such things is drudgery for the lowest slaves;\r\nphilosophy lies deeper. It is not her office to teach men how to use\r\ntheir hands. The object of her lessons is to form the soul. Non est,\r\ninqueim, instrumentorum ad usas necessaries opfex.” If the non were\r\nleft out, this last sentence would be no bad description of the Baconian\r\nphilosophy, and would, indeed, very much resemble several expressions in\r\nthe _Novum Organum_. “We shall next be told,” exclaims Seneca, “that the\r\nfirst shoemaker was a philosopher.” For our own part, if we are forced\r\nto make our choice between the first shoemaker, and the author of the\r\nthree books On Anger, we pronounce for the shoemaker. It may be worse\r\nto be angry than to be wet. But shoes have kept millions from being wet;\r\nand we doubt whether Seneca ever kept any body from being angry. {438}It\r\nis very reluctantly that Seneca can be brought to confess that any\r\nphilosopher had ever paid the smallest attention to any thing that could\r\npossibly promote what vulgar people would consider as the well-being of\r\nmankind. He labors to clear Democritus from the disgraceful imputation\r\nof having made the first arch, and Anacharsis from the charge of having\r\ncontrived the potter’s wheel. He is forced to own that such a thing\r\nmight happen; and it may also happen, he tells us, that a philosopher\r\nmay be swift of foot. But it is not in his character of philosopher\r\nthat he either wins a race or invents a machine. Iso, to be sure. The\r\nbusiness of a philosopher was to declaim in praise of poverty, with two\r\nmillions sterling out at usury, to meditate epigrammatic conceits about\r\nthe evils of luxury, in gardens which moved the envy of sovereigns, to\r\nrant about liberty, while fawning on the insolent and pampered freedmen\r\nof a tyrant, to celebrate the divine beauty of virtue with the same pen\r\nwhich had just before written a defence of the murder of a mother by a\r\nson.\r\n\r\nFrom the cant of this philosophy, a philosophy meanly proud of its own\r\nunprofitableness, it is delightful to turn to the lessons of the great\r\nEnglish teacher. We can almost forgive all the faults of Bacon’s life\r\nwhen we read that singularly graceful and dignified passage: “Ego certe,\r\nut de me ipso, quod res est, loquar, et in iis que nunc edo, et in iis\r\nquæ in posterum meditor, dignitatem ingenii et nominis mei, si qua sit,\r\nsæpius sciens et volens projicio, dum commodis humanis inserviam; quique\r\narehitectus fortasse in phi-losophia et scientiis esse debeam, etiam\r\noperarius, et bajulus, et quidvis demum fio, cum baud pauca pue\r\nomnino fieri necesse sit, alii an tern ob innatam superbiam {439}\r\n{439}subterfugiant, ipse sustineam et exsequar.” (1) This _philanthropia_,\r\nwhich, as he said in one of the most remarkable of his early letters,\r\n“was so fixed in his mind, as it could not be removed,” this majestic\r\nhumility, this persuasion that nothing can be too insignificant for the\r\nattention of the wisest, which is not too insignificant to give pleasure\r\nor pain to the meanest, is the great characteristic distinction, the\r\nessential spirit of the Baconian philosophy. We trace it in all that\r\nBacon has written on Physics, on Laws, on Morals. And we conceive that\r\nfrom this peculiarity all the other peculiarities of his system directly\r\nand almost necessarily sprang.\r\n\r\nThe spirit which appears in the passage of Seneca to which we have\r\nreferred, tainted the whole body of the ancient philosophy from the time\r\nof Socrates downwards, and took possession of intellects with which that\r\nof Seneca cannot for a moment be compared. It pervades the dialogues\r\nof Plato. It may be distinctly traced in many parts of the works of\r\nAristotle. Bacon has dropped hints, from which it may be inferred that,\r\nin his opinion, the prevalence of this feeling was in a great measure\r\nto be attributed to the influence of Socrates. Our great countryman\r\nevidently did not consider the revolution which Socrates effected in\r\nphilosophy as a happy event, and constantly maintained that the earlier\r\nGreek speculators, Democritus in particular, were, on the whole,\r\nsuperior to their more celebrated successors. (2)\r\n\r\nAssuredly if the tree which Socrates planted and\r\n\r\n     1 _De Augmentis_, Lib. 7. Cap. 1.\r\n\r\n     2 _Novum, Organum_, Lib. 1. Aph. 71, 79. _De Augmeniis_,\r\n     Lib. 3. Cap. 4. De Principiis atque originibus. _Cogitala el\r\n     visa_. Redargutio philosophiarum.\r\n\r\n{440}Plato watered is to be judged of by its flowers and leaves, it is\r\nthe noblest of trees. But if we take the homely test of Bacon, if we\r\njudge of the tree by its fruits, our opinion of it may perhaps be less\r\nfavourable. When we sum up all the useful truths which we owe to that\r\nphilosophy, to what do they amount? We find, indeed, abundant proofs\r\nthat some of those who cultivated it were men of the first order of\r\nintellect. We find among their writings incomparable specimens both\r\nof dialectical and rhetorical art. We have no doubt that the ancient\r\ncontroversies were of use, in so far as they served to exercise the\r\nfaculties of the disputants; for there is no controversy so idle that it\r\nmay not be of use in this way. But, when we look for something more, for\r\nsomething which adds to the comforts or alleviates the calamities of the\r\nhuman race, we are forced to own ourselves disappointed. We are forced\r\nto say with Bacon that this celebrated philosophy ended in nothing but\r\ndisputation, that it was neither a vineyard nor an olive-ground, but\r\nan intricate wood of briars and thistles, from which those who lost\r\nthemselves in it brought back many scratches and no food. (1)\r\n\r\nWe readily acknowledge that some of the teachers of this unfruitful\r\nwisdom were among the greatest men that the world has ever seen. If we\r\nadmit the justice of Bacon’s censure, we admit it with regret, similar\r\nto that which Dante felt when he learned the fate of those illustrious\r\nheathens who were doomed to the first circle of Hell.\r\n\r\n                   “Gran duol mi prese at cuor quando to ’ntesi,\r\n\r\n                   Perocchë gente di motto valore\r\n\r\n                   Conobbi che ’n quel limbo eran sospesi.”\r\n\r\nBut in truth the very admiration which we feel for\r\n\r\n     (1) _Novum Organum_, Lib. 1. Aph. 73.\r\n\r\n{441}the eminent philosophers of antiquity forces us to adopt the\r\nopinion that their powers were systematically misdirected. For how else\r\ncould it be that such powers should effect so little for mankind? A\r\npedestrian may show as much muscular vigour on a treadmill as on the\r\nhighway road. But on the road his vigour will assuredly carry him\r\nforward; and on the treadmill he will not advance an inch. The ancient\r\nphilosophy was a treadmill, not a path. It was made up of revolving\r\nquestions, of controversies which were always beginning again. It was\r\na contrivance for having much exertion and no progress. We must\r\nacknowledge that more than once, while contemplating the doctrines of\r\nthe Academy and the Portico, even as they appear in the transparent\r\nsplendour of Cicero’s incomparable diction, we have been tempted to\r\nmutter with the surly centurion in Persius, “Cur quis non prandeat hoc\r\nest?” What is the highest good, whether pain be an evil, whether all\r\nthings be fated, whether we can be certain of any thing, whether we can\r\nbe certain that we are certain of nothing, whether a wise man can be\r\nunhappy, whether all departures from right be equally reprehensible,\r\nthese, and other questions of the same sort, occupied the brains, the\r\ntongues, and the pens of the ablest men in the civilised world during\r\nseveral centuries. This sort of philosophy, it is evident, could not be\r\nprogressive. It might indeed sharpen and invigorate the minds of those\r\nwho devoted themselves to it; and so might the disputes of the orthodox\r\nLilliputians and the heretical Blefuscudians about the big ends and the\r\nlittle ends of eggs. But such disputes could add nothing to the stock\r\nof knowledge. The human mind accordingly, instead of marching, merely\r\nmarked time. It took as much trouble as would have sufficed to carry\r\nit forward; {442}and yet remained on the same spot. There was no\r\naccumulation of truth, no heritage of truth acquired by the labour of\r\none generation and bequeathed to another, to be again transmitted with\r\nlarge additions to a third. Where this philosophy was in the time of\r\nCicero, there it continued to be in the time of Seneca, and there it\r\ncontinued to be in the time of Favorinus. The same sects were still\r\nbattling with the same unsatisfactory arguments about the same\r\ninterminable questions. There had been no want of ingenuity, of zeal,\r\nof industry. Every trace of intellectual cultivation was there, except\r\na harvest. There had been plenty of ploughing, harrowing, reaping,\r\nthreshing. But the garners contained only smut and stubble.\r\n\r\nThe ancient philosophers did not neglect natural science; but they\r\ndid not cultivate it for the purpose of increasing the power and\r\nameliorating the condition of man. The taint of barrenness had spread\r\nfrom ethical to physical speculations. Seneca wrote largely on natural\r\nphilosophy, and magnified the importance of that study. But why? Not\r\nbecause it tended to assuage suffering, to multiply the conveniences of\r\nlife, to extend the empire of man over the material world; but solely\r\nbecause it tended to raise the mind above low cares, to separate it\r\nfrom the body, to exercise its subtilty in the solution of very obscure\r\nquestions. (1) Thus natural philosophy was considered in the light\r\nmerely of a mental exercise. It was made subsidiary to the art of\r\ndisputation; and it consequently proved altogether barren of useful\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nThere was one sect which, however absurd and pernicious some of its\r\ndoctrines may have been, ought,\r\n\r\n     (1) Seneca, _Nat. Quoest. proef_. Lib. 3.\r\n\r\n{443}it should seem, to have merited an exception from the general\r\ncensure which Bacon has pronounced on the ancient schools of wisdom. The\r\nEpicurean, who referred all happiness to bodily pleasure, and all\r\nevil to bodily pain, might have been expected to exert himself for\r\nthe purpose of bettering his own physical condition and that of his\r\nneighbours. But the thought seems never to have occurred to any member\r\nof that school. Indeed, their notion, as reported by their great poet,\r\nwas, that no more improvements were to be expected in the arts which\r\nconduce to the comfort of life.\r\n\r\n                        “Ad victum quae flagicat usus\r\n\r\n                   Omnia jam ferme mortalibus esse parata.”\r\n\r\nThis contented despondency, this disposition to admire what has\r\nbeen done, and to expect that nothing more will be done, is strongly\r\ncharacteristic of all the schools which preceded the school of Fruit and\r\nProgress. Widely as the Epicurean and the Stoic differed on most points,\r\nthey seem to have quite agreed in their contempt for pursuits so vulgar\r\nas to be useful. The philosophy of both was a garrulous, declaiming,\r\ncanting, wrangling philosophy. Century after century they continued to\r\nrepeat their hostile war-cries, Virtue and Pleasure; and in the end\r\nit appeared that the Epicurean had added as little to the quantity of\r\npleasure as the Stoic to the quantity of virtue. It is on the pedestal\r\nof Bacon, not on that of Epicurus, that those noble lines ought to be\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n                   “O tenebris tantis tam clarum extollere lumen\r\n\r\n                   Qui primus potuisti, illustrous commoda vitæ.”\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century Christianity had conquered Paganism, and Paganism\r\nhad infected Christianity. The Church was now victorious and corrupt.\r\nThe {444}rites of the Pantheon had passed into her worship, the\r\nsubtilties of the Academy into her creed. In an evil day, though with\r\ngreat pomp and solemnity,--we quote the language of Bacon,--was the\r\nill-starred alliance stricken between the old philosophy and the new\r\nfaith. (1) Questions widely different from those which had employed\r\nthe ingenuity of Pyrrho and Carneades, but just as subtle, just as\r\ninterminable, and just as unprofitable, exercised the minds of the\r\nlively and voluble Greeks. When learning began to revive in the West,\r\nsimilar trifles occupied the sharp and vigorous intellects of the\r\nSchoolmen. There was another sowing of the wind, and another reaping of\r\nthe whirlwind. The great work of improving the condition of the human\r\nrace was still considered as unworthy of a man of learning. Those\r\nwho undertook that task, if what they effected could be readily\r\ncomprehended, were despised as mechanics; if not, they were in danger of\r\nbeing burned as conjurers.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a stronger proof of the degree in which the human mind\r\nhad been misdirected than the history of the two greatest events which\r\ntook place du ring the middle ages. We speak of the invention of\r\nGunpowder and of the invention of Printing. The dates of both are\r\nunknown. The authors of both are unknown. Nor was this because men were\r\ntoo rude and ignorant to value intellectual superiority. The inventor of\r\ngunpowder appears to have been contemporary with Petrarch and Boccaccio.\r\nThe inventor of printing was certainly contemporary with Nicholas\r\nthe Fifth, with Cosmo de’ Medici, and with a crowd of distinguished\r\nscholars. But the human mind still retained that fatal bent which it had\r\nreceived two\r\n\r\n     (1) _Cogitata et visa._\r\n\r\n{445}thousand years earlier. George of Trebisond and Marsilio Ficino\r\nwould not easily have been brought to believe that the inventor of the\r\nprinting-press had done more for mankind than themselves, or than those\r\nancient writers of whom they were the enthusiastic votaries.\r\n\r\nAt length the time arrived when the barren philosophy which had, during\r\nso many ages, employed the faculties of the ablest of men, was destined\r\nto fall. It had worn many shapes. It had mingled itself with many\r\ncreeds. It had survived revolutions in which empires, religions,\r\nlanguages, races, had perished. Driven from its ancient haunts, it had\r\ntaken sanctuary in that Church which it had persecuted, and had, like\r\nthe daring friends of the poet, placed its seat\r\n\r\n                             “next the seat of God,\r\n\r\n                   And with its darkness dared affront his light.”\r\n\r\nWords, and more words, and nothing but words, had been all the fruit of\r\nall the toil of all the most renowned sages of sixty generations. But\r\nthe days of this sterile exuberance were numbered.\r\n\r\nMany causes predisposed the public mind to a change. The study of\r\na great variety of ancient writers, though it did not give a right\r\ndirection to philosophical research, did much towards destroying that\r\nblind reverence for authority which had prevailed when Aristotle ruled\r\nalone. The rise of the Florentine sect of Platonists, a sect to which\r\nbelonged some of the finest minds of the fifteenth century, was not\r\nan unimportant event. The mere substitution of the Academic for the\r\nPeripatetic philosophy would indeed have done little good. But any thing\r\nwas better than the old habit of unreasoning servility. It was\r\n{446}something to have a choice of tyrants. “A spark of freedom,” as\r\nGibbon has justly remarked, “was produced by this collision of adverse\r\nservitude.”\r\n\r\nOther causes might be mentioned. But it is chiefly to the great\r\nreformation of religion that we owe the great reformation of philosophy.\r\nThe alliance between the Schools and the Vatican had for ages been so\r\nclose that those who threw off the dominion of the Vatican could not\r\ncontinue to recognise the authority of the Schools. Most of the chiefs\r\nof the schism treated the Peripatetic philosophy with contempt, and\r\nspoke of Aristotle as if Aristotle had been answerable for all the\r\ndogmas of Thomas Aquinas. “Nullo apud Lutheranos philosophiam esse in\r\npretio,” was a reproach which the defenders of the Church of Rome loudly\r\nrepeated, and which many of the Protestant leaders considered as a\r\ncompliment. Scarcely any text was more frequently cited by the reformers\r\nthan that in which St. Paul cautions the Colossians not to let any man\r\nspoil them by philosophy. Luther, almost at the outset of his career,\r\nwent so far as to declare that no man could be at once a proficient in\r\nthe school of Aristotle and in that of Christ. Zwingle, Bucer,\r\nPeter Martyr, Calvin, held similar language. In some of the Scotch\r\nuniversities, the Aristotelian system was discarded for that of Ramus.\r\nThus, before the birth of Bacon, the empire cf the scholastic philosophy\r\nhad been shaken to its foundations. There was in the intellectual world\r\nan anarchy resembling that which in the political world often follows\r\nthe overthrow of an old and deeply rooted government. Antiquity,\r\nprescription, the sound of great names, had ceased to awe mankind. The\r\ndynasty which had reigned for ages was at an end; and the vacant throne\r\nwas left to be struggled for by pretenders. {447}The first effect of\r\nthis great revolution, was, as Bacon most justly observed, (1) to give\r\nfor a time an undue importance to the mere graces of style. The new\r\nbreed of scholars, the Aschams and Buchanans, nourished with the finest\r\ncompositions of the Augustan age, regarded with loathing the dry,\r\ncrabbed, and barbarous diction of respondents and opponents, They were\r\nfar less studious about the matter of their writing than about the\r\nmanner. They succeeded in reforming Latinity; but they never even\r\naspired to effect a reform in philosophy.\r\n\r\nAt this time Bacon appeared. It is altogether incorrect to say, as\r\nhas often been said, that he was the first man who rose up against the\r\nAristotelian philosophy when in the height of its power. The authority\r\nof that philosophy had, as we have shown, received a fatal blow long\r\nbefore he was born. Several speculators, among whom Ramus is the best\r\nknown, had recently attempted to form new sects. Bacon’s own expressions\r\nabout the state of public opinion in the time of Luther are clear\r\nand strong: “Accedebat,” says he, “odium et contemptus, illis ipsis\r\ntemporibus ortus erga Scholasticos.” And again, “Scholasticorum doctrina\r\ndespectui prorsus haberi copit tanquam aspera et barbara.” (2) The\r\npart which Bacon played in this great change was the part, not of\r\nRobespierre, but of Bonaparte. The ancient order of things had been\r\nsubverted. Some bigots still cherished with devoted loyalty the\r\nremembrance of the fallen monarchy and exerted themselves to effect\r\na restoration. But the majority had no such feeling. Freed, yet not\r\nknowing how to use their freedom,\r\n\r\n     (1) _De Augments_, Lib. 1.\r\n\r\n     (2)  Both these passages are in the first book of the De\r\n     Augmentis.\r\n\r\n{448}they pursued no determinate course, and had found no leader capable\r\nof conducting them.\r\n\r\nThat leader at length arose. The philosophy which he taught was\r\nessentially new. It differed from that of the celebrated ancient\r\nteachers, not merely in method, but also in object. Its object was the\r\ngood of mankind, in the sense in which the mass of mankind always have\r\nunderstood and always will understand the word good. “Meditor,” said\r\nBacon, “instaurationem philosophise ejusmodi quæ nihil inanis ant\r\nabstracti habeat, quæque vitæ liumanæ conditiones in melius provehat.”\r\n (1)\r\n\r\nThe difference between the philosophy of Bacon and that of his\r\npredecessors cannot, we think, be better illustrated than by comparing\r\nhis views on some important subjects with those of Plato. We select\r\nPlato, because we conceive that he did more than any other person\r\ntowards giving to the minds of speculative men that bent which they\r\nretained till they received from Bacon a new impulse in a diametrically\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how differently these great men estimated the\r\nvalue of every kind of knowledge. Take Arithmetic for example. Plato,\r\nafter speaking slightly of the convenience of being able to reckon\r\nand compute in the ordinary transactions of life, passes to what he\r\nconsiders as a far more important advantage. The study of the properties\r\nof numbers, he tells us, habituates the mind to the contemplation of\r\npure truth, and raises us above the material universe. He would have his\r\ndisciples apply themselves to this study, not that they may be able to\r\nbuy or sell, not that they may qualify themselves to be shop-keepers\r\n\r\n     (1) _Redargutio Philosophiarum._\r\n\r\n{449}or travelling merchants, but that they may learn to\r\nwithdraw their minds from the ever-shifting spectacle of this visible\r\nand tangible world, and to fix them on the immutable essences of things.\r\n(1)\r\n\r\nBacon, on the other hand, valued this branch of knowledge, only on\r\naccount of its uses with reference to that visible and tangible world\r\nwhich Plato so much despised. He speaks with scorn of the mystical\r\narithmetic of the later Platonists, and laments the propensity of\r\nmankind to employ, on mere matters of curiosity, powers the whole\r\nexertion of which is required for purposes of solid advantage. He\r\nadvises arithmeticians to leave these trifles, and to employ themselves\r\nin framing convenient expressions, which may be of use in physical\r\nresearches. (2)\r\n\r\nThe same reasons which led Plato to recommend the study of arithmetic\r\nled him to recommend also the study of mathematics. The vulgar crowd\r\nof geometricians, he says, will not understand him. They have practice\r\nalways in view. They do not know that the real use of the science is\r\nto lead men to the knowledge of abstract, essential, eternal truth. (3)\r\nIndeed, if we are to believe Plutarch, Plato carried this feeling so far\r\nthat he considered geometry as degraded by being applied to any\r\npurpose of vulgar utility. Archytas, it seems, had framed machines of\r\nextraordinary power on mathematical principles. (4) Plato remonstrated\r\nwith his friend, and declared that this was to degrade a noble\r\nintellectual exercise into a low craft, fit only for carpenters and\r\nwheelwrights. The office of geometry, he\r\n\r\n     (1) Plato’s _Republic,_ Book 7.\r\n\r\n     (2) _De Augmentis_, Lib. 3. Cap. 6.\r\n\r\n     (3) Plato’s _Republic_, Book 7.\r\n\r\n     (4) Plutarch, _Sympos_. viii. and _Life of Marcellus_. The\r\n     machines of Archytas are also mentioned by Aulus Gellius and\r\n     Diogenes Laertius\r\n\r\n{450}said, was to discipline the mind, not to minister to the base\r\nwants of the body. His interference was successful; and from that\r\ntime, according to Plutarch, the science of mechanics was considered as\r\nunworthy of the attention of a philosopher.\r\n\r\nArchimedes in a later age imitated and surpassed Archytas. But even\r\nArchimedes was not free from the prevailing notion that geometry was\r\ndegraded by being employed to produce any thing useful. It was with\r\ndifficulty that he was induced to stoop from speculation to practice.\r\nHe was half ashamed of those inventions which were the wonder of hostile\r\nnations, and always spoke of them slightingly as mere amusements, as\r\ntrifles in which a mathematician might be suffered to relax his mind\r\nafter intense application to the higher parts of his science.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Bacon on this subject was diametrically opposed to that\r\nof the ancient philosophers. He valued geometry chiefly, if not solely,\r\non account of those uses, which to Plato appeared so base. And it is\r\nremarkable that the longer Bacon lived the stronger this feeling became.\r\nWhen in 1605 he wrote the two books on the Advancement of Learning, he\r\ndwelt on the advantages which mankind derived from mixed mathematics;\r\nbut he at the same time admitted that the beneficial effect produced by\r\nmathematical study on the intellect, though a collateral advantage, was\r\n“no less worthy than that which was principal and intended.” But it\r\nis evident that his views underwent a change. When, near twenty years\r\nlater, he published the _De Augmentis_, which is the Treatise on the\r\nAdvancement of Learning, greatly expanded and carefully corrected, he\r\nmade important alterations in the part which related to mathematics.\r\n{451}He condemned with severity the high pretensions of the\r\nmathematicians, “delicias et fastum mathemati-corum.” Assuming the\r\nwell-being of the human race to be the end of knowledge, (1) he\r\npronounced that mathematical science could claim no higher rank than\r\nthat of an appendage or an auxiliary to other sciences. Mathematical\r\nscience, he says, is the handmaid of natural philosophy; she ought to\r\ndemean herself as such; and he declares that he cannot conceive by what\r\nill chance it has happened that she presumes to claim precedence over\r\nher mistress. He predicts--a prediction which would have made Plato\r\nshudder--that as more and more discoveries are made in physics, there\r\nwill be more and more branches of mixed mathematics. Of that collateral\r\nadvantage the value of which, twenty years before, he rated so highly,\r\nhe says not one word. This omission cannot have been the effect of mere\r\ninadvertence. His own treatise was before him. From that treatise he\r\ndeliberately expunged whatever was favourable to the study of pure\r\nmathematics, and inserted several keen reflections on the ardent\r\nvotaries of that study. This fact, in our opinion, admits of only one\r\nexplanation. Bacon’s love of those pursuits which directly tend to\r\nimprove the condition of mankind, and his jealousy of all pursuits\r\nmerely curious, had grown upon him, and had, it may be, become\r\nimmoderate. He was afraid of using any expression which might have the\r\neffect of inducing any man of talents to employ in speculations,\r\nuseful only to the mind of the speculator, a single hour which might be\r\nemployed in extending the empire of man over matter. (2) If Bacon erred\r\nhere, we\r\n\r\n     (1) Usui et commodis hominum consulirems.\r\n\r\n     (2) Compare the passage relating to mathematics in the\r\n     Second Book of the Advancement of Learning, with the _De\r\n     Augmeniis_, Lib. 3. Cap. 6.\r\n\r\n{452}must acknowledge that we greatly prefer his error to the opposite\r\nerror of Plato. We have no patience with a philosophy which, like those\r\nRoman matrons who swallowed abortives in order to preserve their shapes,\r\ntakes pains to be barren for fear of being homely.\r\n\r\nLet us pass to astronomy. This was one of the sciences which Plato\r\nexhorted his disciples to learn, but for reasons for removed from common\r\nhabits of thinking. “Shall we set down astronomy,” says Socrates, “among\r\nthe subjects of study?” (1) “I think so,” answers his young friend\r\nGlaucon: “to know something about the seasons, the months, and the\r\nyears is of use for military purposes, as well as for agriculture and\r\nnavigation.”\r\n\r\n“It amuses me,” says Socrates, “to see how afraid you are, lest\r\nthe common herd of people should accuse you of recommending useless\r\nstudies.” He then proceeds, in that pure and magnificent diction which,\r\nas Cicero said, Jupiter would use if Jupiter spoke Greek, to explain\r\nthat the use of astronomy is not to add to the vulgar comforts of life,\r\nbut to assist in raising the mind to the contemplation of things which\r\nare to be perceived by the pure intellect alone. The knowledge of the\r\nactual motions of the heavenly bodies Socrates considers as of little\r\nvalue. The appearances which make the sky beautiful at night are, he\r\ntells us, like the figures which a geometrician draws on the sand, mere\r\nexamples, mere helps to feeble minds. We must get beyond them; we must\r\nneglect them; we must attain to an astronomy which is as independent of\r\nthe actual stars as geometrical truth is independent of the lines of an\r\nill-drawn diagram. This is, we imagine, very nearly, if not exactly, the\r\nastronomy which Bacon\r\n\r\n     (1) Plato’s _Republic_, Book 7.\r\n\r\n{453}compared to the ox of Prometheus, (1) a sleek, wellshaped hide,\r\nstuffed with rubbish, goodly to look at, but containing nothing to eat.\r\nHe complained that astronomy had, to its great injury, been separated\r\nfrom natural philosophy, of which it was one of the noblest provinces,\r\nand annexed to the domain of mathematics. The world stood in need, he\r\nsaid, of a very different astronomy, of a living astronomy, (2) of\r\nan astronomy which should set forth the nature, the motion, and the\r\ninfluences of the heavenly bodies, as they really are. (3)\r\n\r\nOn the greatest and most useful of all human inventions, the invention\r\nof alphabetical writing, Plato did not look with much complacency. He\r\nseems to have thought that the use of letters had operated on the human\r\nmind as the use of the go-cart in learning to walk, or of corks in\r\nlearning to swim, is said to operate on the human body. It was a support\r\nwhich, in his opinion, soon became indispensable to those who used it,\r\nwhich made vigorous exertion first unnecessary and then impossible.\r\nThe powers of the intellect would, he conceived, have been more fully\r\ndeveloped without this delusive aid. Men would have been compelled to\r\nexercise? the understanding and the memory, and, by deep and assiduous\r\nmeditation, to make truth thoroughly their own. Now, on the contrary,\r\nmuch knowledge is traced on paper, but little is engraved in the soul. A\r\nman is certain that he can find information at a moment’s notice when\r\nhe wants it. He therefore suffers it to fade from his mind. Such a man\r\ncannot in strictness\r\n\r\n     (1) _De Augmentis_, Lib. 3. Cap. 4.\r\n\r\n     (2) Astronomia viva.\r\n\r\n     (3) “Quæ substantiam et motum et influxum colestium, prout\r\n     re vera flint proponat.” Compare this language with Plato’s,\r\n     “[Greek]”\r\n\r\n{454}be said to know any thing. He has the show without the reality of\r\nwisdom. These opinions Plato has put into the mouth of an ancient king\r\nof Egypt. (1) But it is evident from the context that they were his own;\r\nand so they were understood to be by Quinctilian. (2) Indeed they are\r\nin perfect accordance with the whole Platonic system.\r\n\r\nBacon’s views, as may easily be supposed, were widely different. (3) The\r\npowers of the memory, he observes, without the help of writing, can do\r\nlittle towards the advancement of any useful science. He acknowledges\r\nthat the memory may be disciplined to such a point as to be able to\r\nperform very extraordinary feats. But on such feats he sets little\r\nvalue. The habits of his mind, he tells us, are such that he is not\r\ndisposed to rate highly any accomplishment, however rare, which is of\r\nno practical use to mankind. As to these prodigious achievements of the\r\nmemory, he ranks them with the exhibitions of rope-dancers and tumblers.\r\n“The two performances,” he says, “are of much the same sort. The one is\r\nan abuse of the powers of the body; the other is an abuse of the powers\r\nof the mind. Both may perhaps excite our wonder; but neither is entitled\r\nto our respect.”(4)\r\n\r\nTo Plato, the science of medicine appeared to be of very disputable\r\nadvantage. He did not indeed object to quick cures for acute disorders,\r\nor for injuries produced by accidents. But the art which resists the\r\nslow sap of a chronic disease, which repairs frames enervated by lust,\r\nswollen by gluttony, or inflamed by wine, which encourages sensuality\r\nby mitigating the natural punishment of the sensualist, and prolongs\r\nexistence\r\n\r\n     (1) Pinto’s Phaedrus.\r\n\r\n     (2)  Quinctilian, XI.\r\n\r\n     (3) De Augmentis Lib. 5. Cup. 5.\r\n\r\n     (4) Pluto’s Republic, Book 3.\r\n\r\n{455}when the intellect has ceased to retain its entire energy, had no\r\nshare of his esteem. A life protracted by medical skill he pronounced to\r\nbe a long death. The existence of the art of medicine ought, he said,\r\nto be tolerated, so far as that art may serve to cure the occasional\r\ndistempers of men whose constitutions are good. As to those who have\r\nbad constitutions, let them die; and the sooner the better. Such men\r\nare unfit for war, for magistracy, for the management of their domestic\r\naffairs, for severe study and speculation. If they engage in any\r\nvigorous mental exercise, they are troubled with giddiness and fulness\r\nof the head, all which they lay to the account of philosophy. The best\r\nthing that can happen to such wretches is to have done with life at\r\nonce. He quotes mythical authority in support of this doctrine; and\r\nreminds his disciples that the practice of the sons of Æsculapius, as\r\ndescribed by Homer, extended only to the cure of external injuries.\r\n\r\nFar different was the philosophy of Bacon. Of all the sciences, that\r\nwhich he seems to have regarded with the greatest interest was the\r\nscience which, in Plato’s opinion, would not be tolerated in a well\r\nregulated community. To make men perfect was no part of Bacon’s plan.\r\nHis humble aim was to make imperfect men comfortable. The beneficence of\r\nhis philosophy resembled the beneficence of the common Father, whose sun\r\nrises on the evil and the good, whose rain descends for the just and\r\nthe unjust. In Plato’s opinion man was made for philosophy; in Bacon’s\r\nopinion philosophy was made for man; it was a means to an end; and that\r\nend was to increase the pleasures and to mitigate the pains of millions\r\nwho are not and cannot be philosophers. That a valetudinarian who took\r\ngreat pleasure in being wheeled along his terrace, who relished {456}his\r\nboiled chicken and his weak wine and water, and who enjoyed a hearty\r\nlaugh over the Queen of Navarre’s tales, should be treated as a _caput\r\nlupinum_ because he could not read the Timæus without a headache, was\r\na notion which the humane spirit of the English school of wisdom\r\naltogether rejected. Bacon would not have thought it beneath the\r\ndignity of a philosopher to contrive an improved garden chair for such\r\na valetudinarian, to devise some way of rendering his medicines more\r\npalatable, to invent repasts which he might enjoy, and pillows on which\r\nhe might sleep soundly; and this though there might not be the\r\nsmallest hope that the mind of the poor invalid would ever rise to the\r\ncontemplation of the ideal beautiful and the ideal good. As Plato had\r\ncited the religious legends of Greece to justify his contempt for the\r\nmore recondite parts of the art of healing, Bacon vindicated the dignity\r\nof that art by appealing to the example of Christ, and reminded men that\r\nthe great Physician of the soul did not disdain to be also the physician\r\nof the body. (1)\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the science of medicine to that of legislation, we\r\nfind the same difference between the systems of these two great men.\r\nPlato, at the commencement of the Dialogue on Laws, lays it down as\r\na fundamental principle that the end of legislation is to make men\r\nvirtuous. It is unnecessary to point out the extravagant conclusions to\r\nwhich such a proposition leads. Bacon well knew to how great an extent\r\nthe happiness of every society must depend on the virtue of its members;\r\nand he also knew what legislators can and what they cannot do for the\r\npurpose of promoting virtue. The view which he has given of the end of\r\n\r\n     (1) De Augmentis, Lib. 4. Cap. 2.\r\n\r\n{457}legislation, and of the principal means for the attainment of that\r\nend, has always seemed to us eminently happy, even among the many happy\r\npassages of the same kind with which his works abound. “Finis et scopus\r\nquem leges intueri atopie ad quern jussion es et sanction es suas\r\ndirigere debent, non alius est quam ut cives féliciter degant. Id fixet\r\nsi pietate et religione recte instituti, moribus honesti, armis ad\r\nversus liostes externos tuti, legum auxilio adversus seditiones et\r\npri-vatas injurias muniti, imperio et magistratibus obse-quentes, copiis\r\net opibus locupletes et florentes fluent.” (1) The end is the well-being\r\nof the people. The means are the imparting of moral and religious\r\neducation; the providing of every thing necessary for defence against\r\nforeign enemies; the maintaining of internal order; the establishing of\r\na judicial, financial, and commercial system, under which wealth may be\r\nrapidly accumulated and securely enjoyed.\r\n\r\nEven with respect to the form in which laws ought to be drawn, there is\r\na remarkable difference of opinion between the Greek and the Englishman.\r\nPlato thought a preamble essential; Bacon thought it mischievous. Each\r\nwas consistent with himself. Plato, considering the moral improvement of\r\nthe people as the end of legislation, justly inferred that a law which\r\ncommanded and threatened, but which neither convinced the reason, nor\r\ntouched the heart, must be a most imperfect law. He was not content with\r\ndeterring from theft a man who still continued to be a thief at heart,\r\nwith restraining a son who hated his mother from beating his mother.\r\nThe only obedience on which he set much value was the obedience which an\r\nenlightened\r\n\r\n     (1) De Augmentis, Lib. 8. Cap. 3. Aph. 5.\r\n\r\n{458}understanding yields to reason, and which a virtuous disposition\r\nyields to precepts of virtue. He really seems to have believed that, by\r\nprefixing to every law an eloquent and pathetic exhortation, he\r\nshould, to a great extent, render penal enactments superfluous. Bacon\r\nentertained no such romantic hopes; and he well knew the practical\r\ninconveniences of the course which Plato recommended. “Neque nobis,”\r\n says he, “prologi legum qui inepti olim liabiti sunt, et leges\r\nin-troducunt disputantes non jubentes, utique placèrent, si priscos\r\nmores ferre possemus....Quantum fieri potest prologi evitentur, et lex\r\nincipiat a jussione.” (1)\r\n\r\nEach of the great men whom we have compared intended to illustrate his\r\nsystem by a philosophical romance; and each left his romance imperfect.\r\nHad Plato lived to finish the Critias, a comparison between that noble\r\nfiction and the new Atlantis would probably have furnished us with still\r\nmore striking instances than any which we have given. It is amusing\r\nto think with what horror he would have seen such an institution as\r\nSolomon’s House rising in his republic: with what vehemence he would\r\nhave ordered the brewhouses, the perfume-houses, and the dispensatories\r\nto be pulled down; and with what inexorable rigour he would have driven\r\nbeyond the frontier all the Fellows of the College, Merchants of Light\r\nand Depredators, Lamps and Pioneers.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the whole, we should say that the aim of the Platonic\r\nphilosophy was to exalt man into a god. The aim of the Baconian\r\nphilosophy was to provide man with what he requires while he continues\r\nto be man. The aim of the Platonic philosophy was to raise\r\n\r\n     (1) _De Augmentis_, Lib. 8. Cap. 3. Aph. 69.\r\n\r\n{450}us far above vulgar wants. The aim of the Baconian philosophy was\r\nto supply our vulgar wants. The former aim was noble; but the latter was\r\nattainable.\r\n\r\nPlato drew a good bow; but, like Acestes in Virgil, he aimed at the\r\nstars; and therefore, though there was no want of strength or skill,\r\nthe shot was thrown away. His arrow was indeed followed by a track of\r\ndazzling radiance, but it struck nothing.\r\n\r\n               “Volans liquidis in nubibus arsit arundo\r\n\r\n               Signavitque viam flammis, tennisque recessit\r\n\r\n               Consunipta in ventos.”\r\n\r\nBacon fixed his eye on a mark which was placed on the earth, and within\r\nbow-shot, and hit it in the white. The philosophy of Plato began in\r\nwords and ended in words, noble words indeed, words such as were to\r\nbe expected from the finest of human intellects exercising boundless\r\ndominion over the finest of human languages. The philosophy of Bacon\r\nbegan in observations and ended in arts.\r\n\r\nThe boast of the ancient philosophers was that their doctrine formed the\r\nminds of men to a high degree of wisdom and virtue. This was indeed the\r\nonly practical good which the most celebrated of those teachers even\r\npretended to effect; and undoubtedly, if they had effected this, they\r\nwould have deserved far higher praise than if they had discovered the\r\nmost salutary medicines or constructed the most powerful machines. But\r\nthe truth is that, in those very matters in which alone they professed\r\nto do any good to mankind, in those very matters for the sake of which\r\nthey neglected all the vulgar interests of mankind, they did nothing, or\r\nworse than nothing. They promised what was impracticable; they despised\r\nwhat was practicable; they {460}filled the world with long words and\r\nlong beards; and they left it as wicked and as ignorant as they found\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAn acre in Middlesex is better than a principality in Utopia. The\r\nsmallest actual good is better than the most magnificent promises\r\nof impossibilities. The wise man of the Stoics would, no doubt, be a\r\ngrander object than a steam-engine. But there are steam-engines. And\r\nthe wise man of the Stoics is yet to be born. A philosophy which should\r\nenable a man to feel perfectly happy while in agonies of pain would be\r\nbetter than a philosophy which assuages pain. But we know that there\r\nare remedies which will assuage pain and we know that the ancient sages\r\nliked the toothache just as little as their neighbours. A philosophy\r\nwhich should extinguish cupidity would be better than a philosophy which\r\nshould devise laws for the security of property. But it is possible to\r\nmake laws which shall, to a very great extent, secure property. And we\r\ndo not understand how any motives which the ancient philosophy furnished\r\ncould extinguish cupidity. Mre know indeed that the philosophers were no\r\nbetter than other men. From the testimony of friends as well as of foes,\r\nfrom the confessions of Epictetus and Seneca, as well as from the sneers\r\nof Lucian and the fierce invectives of Juvenal, it is plain that these\r\nteachers of virtue had all the vices of their neighbours, with the\r\nadditional vice of hypocrisy. Some people may think the object of the\r\nBaconian philosophy a low object, but they cannot deny that, high or\r\nlow, it has been attained. They cannot deny that every year makes an\r\naddition to what Bacon called “fruit.” They cannot deny that mankind\r\nhave made, and are making, great and constant progress in the road which\r\nhe pointed out to them. Was {461}there any such progressive movement\r\namong the ancient philosophers? After they had been declaiming eight\r\nhundred years, had they made the world better than when they began?\r\nOur belief is that, among the philosophers themselves, instead of a\r\nprogressive improvement there was a progressive degeneracy. An abject\r\nsuperstition which Democritus or Anaxagoras would have rejected with\r\nscorn added the last disgrace to the long dotage of the Stoic and\r\nPlatonic schools. Those unsuccessful attempts to articulate which are\r\nso delightful and interesting in a child shock and disgust us in an aged\r\nparalytic; and in the same way, those wild mythological fictions which\r\ncharm us, when we hear them lisped by Greek poetry in its infancy,\r\nexcite a mixed sensation of pity and loathing, when mumbled by Greek\r\nphilosophy in its old age. We know that guns, cutlery, spy-glasses,\r\nclocks, are better in our time than they were in the time of our\r\nfathers, and were better in the time of our fathers than they were in\r\nthe time of our grandfathers. We might, therefore, be inclined to think\r\nthat, when a philosophy which boasted that its object was the elevation\r\nand purification of the mind, and which for this object neglected the\r\nsordid office of ministering to the comforts of the body, had flourished\r\nin the highest honour during many hundreds of years, a vast moral\r\namelioration must have taken place. Was it so? Look at the schools of\r\nthis wisdom four centuries before the Christian era and four centuries\r\nafter that era. Compare the men whom those schools formed at those two\r\nperiods. Compare Plato and Libanius. Compare Pericles and Julian. This\r\nphilosophy confessed, nay boasted, that for every end but one it was\r\nuseless. Had it attained that one end? {462}Suppose that Justinian, when\r\nhe closed the schools of Athens, had called on the last few sages who\r\nstill haunted the Portico, and lingered round the ancient plane-trees,\r\nto show their title to public veneration: suppose that he had said; “A\r\nthousand years have elapsed since, in this famous city, Socrates posed\r\nProtagoras and Hippias; during those thousand years a large proportion\r\nof the ablest men of every generation has been employed in constant\r\nefforts to bring to perfection the philosophy which you teach; that\r\nphilosophy has been munificently patronised by the powerful; its\r\nprofessors have been held in the highest esteem by the public; it has\r\ndrawn to itself almost all the sap and vigour of the human intellect:\r\nand what has it effected? What profitable truth has it taught us which\r\nwe should not equally have known without it? What has it enabled us to\r\ndo which we should not have been equally able to do without it?” Such\r\nquestions, we suspect, would have puzzled Simplicius and Isidore. Ask a\r\nfollower of Bacon what the new philosophy, as it was called in the\r\ntime of Charles the Second, has effected for mankind, and his answer\r\nis ready; “It has lengthened life; it has mitigated pain; it has\r\nextinguished diseases; it has increased the fertility of the soil; it\r\nhas given new securities to the mariner; it has furnished new arms to\r\nthe warrior; it has spanned great rivers and estuaries with bridges of\r\nform unknown to our fathers; it has guided the thunderbolt innocuously\r\nfrom heaven to earth; it has lighted up the night with the splendour\r\nof the day; it has extended the range of the human vision; it has\r\nmultiplied the power of the human muscles; it has accelerated motion;\r\nit has annihilated distance; it has facilitated intercourse,\r\ncorrespondence, all friendly offices, all despatch of business; it has\r\n{463}enabled man to descend to the depths of the sea, to soar into the\r\nair, to penetrate securely into the noxious recesses of the earth, to\r\ntraverse the land in cars which whirl along without horses, and the\r\nocean in ships which run ten knots an hour against the wind. These\r\nare but a part of its fruits, and of its first fruits. For it is a\r\nphilosophy which never rests, which has never attained, which is never\r\nperfect. Its law is progress. A point which yesterday was invisible is\r\nits goal to-day, and will be its starting-post to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nGreat and various as the powers of Bacon were, he owes his wide and\r\ndurable fame chiefly to this, that all those powers received their\r\ndirection from common sense. His love of the vulgar useful, his strong\r\nsympathy with the popular notions of good and evil, and the openness\r\nwith which he avowed that sympathy, are the secret of his influence.\r\nThere was in his system no cant, no illusion. He had no anointing for\r\nbroken hones, no fine theories _de finibus_, no arguments to persuade\r\nmen out of their senses. He knew that men, and philosophers as well as\r\nother men, do actually love life, health, comfort, honour, security,\r\nthe society of friends, and do actually dislike death, sickness, pain,\r\npoverty, disgrace, danger, separation from those to whom they are\r\nattached. He knew that religion, though it often regulates and moderates\r\nthese feelings, seldom eradicates them; nor did he think it desirable\r\nfor mankind that they should be eradicated. The plan of eradicating\r\nthem by conceits like those of Seneca, or syllogisms like those of\r\nChrysippus, was too preposterous to be for a moment entertained by\r\na mind like his. He did not understand what wisdom there could be in\r\nchanging names where it was impossible to change things; in denying that\r\nblindness, hunger, the gout, {464}the rack, were evils, and calling them\r\n[Greek], in refusing to acknowledge that health, safety, plenty, were\r\ngood things, and dubbing them by the name of [Greek]. In his opinions\r\non all these subjects, he was not a Stoic, nor an Epicurean, nor an\r\nAcademic, but what would have been called by Stoics, Epicureans, and\r\nAcademics a mere a mere common man. And it was precisely because he was\r\nso that his name makes so great an era in the history of the world. It\r\nwas because he dug deep that he was able to pile high. It was because,\r\nin order to lay his foundations, he went down into those parts of human\r\nnature which lie low, but which are not liable to change, that the\r\nfabric which he reared has risen to so stately an elevation, and stands\r\nwith such immovable strength.\r\n\r\nWe have sometimes thought that an amusing fiction might be written,\r\nin which a disciple of Epictetus and a disciple of Bacon should be\r\nintroduced as fellow-travellers. They come to a village where the\r\nsmall-pox has just begun to rage, and find houses shut up, intercourse\r\nsuspended, the sick abandoned, mothers weeping in terror over their\r\nchildren. The Stoic assures the dismayed population that there\r\nis nothing bad in the small-pox, and that to a wise man, disease,\r\ndeformity, death, the loss of friends, are not evils. The Baconian takes\r\nont a lancet and begins to vaccinate. They find a body of miners in\r\ngreat dismay. An explosion of noisome vapours has just killed many of\r\nthose who were at work; and the survivors are afraid to venture into the\r\ncavern. The Stoic assures them that such an accident is nothing but a\r\nmere [Greek]. The Baconian, who has no such fine word at his command,\r\ncontents himself with devising a safety-lamp. They find a shipwrecked\r\nmerchant wringing his hands on the shore. {465}His vessel with an\r\ninestimable cargo has just gone down, and lie is reduced in a moment\r\nfrom opulence to beggary. The Stoic exhorts him not to seek happiness\r\nin things which lie without himself, and repeats the whole chapter of\r\nEpictetus [Greek]. The Baconian constructs a diving-bell, goes down in\r\nit, and returns with the most precious effects from the wreck. It\r\nwould be easy to multiply illustrations of the difference between the\r\nphilosophy of thorns and the philosophy of fruit, the philosophy of\r\nwords and the philosophy of works.\r\n\r\nBacon has been accused of overrating the importance of those sciences\r\nwhich minister to the physical well-being of man, and of underrating the\r\nimportance of moral philosophy; and it cannot be denied that persons who\r\nread the _Novum Organam_ and the _De Augmentis_, without adverting to\r\nthe circumstances under which those works were written, will find much\r\nthat may seem to countenance the accusation. It is certain, however,\r\nthat though in practice he often went very wrong, and though, as his\r\nhistorical work and his essays prove, he did not hold, even in theory,\r\nvery strict opinions on points of political morality, he was far too\r\nwise a man not to know how much our wellbeing depends on the regulation\r\nof our minds. The world for which he wished was not, as some people\r\nseem to imagine, a world of water-wheels, power-looms, steam-carriages,\r\nsensualists, and knaves. He would have been as ready as Zeno himself to\r\nmaintain that no bodily comforts which could be devised by the skill and\r\nlabour of a hundred generations would give happiness to a man whose mind\r\nwas under the tyranny of licentious appetite, of envy, of hatred, or\r\nof fear. If he sometimes appeared to ascribe importance {466}too\r\nexclusively to the arts which increase the outward comforts of\r\nour species, the reason is plain. Those arts had been most unduly\r\ndepreciated. They had been represented as unworthy the attention of a\r\nman of liberal education. “Cogitavit,” says Bacon of himself, “cam\r\nesse opinionem sire æstilnationem humidam et dainnosam, minni nempe\r\nmajestatem mentis luminanæ, si in experimentis et rebus particularibus,\r\nsensui subjectis, et in materia terminatis, din ac multum versetur:\r\npræsertim cum hujusmodi res ad inquirendum laborioue ad meditandum\r\nignobiles, ad discendum asperre, ad practicam illiberales, numéro\r\ninfinitæ, et subtilitate pusillæ videri soleant, et ob hujusmodi\r\nconditiones, glorio artium minus sint accommodate.” (1) This opinion\r\nseemed to him “omnia in familia humana turbasse.” It had undoubtedly\r\ncaused many arts which were of the greatest utility, and which\r\nwere susceptible of the greatest improvements, to be neglected by\r\nspeculators, and abandoned to joiners, masons, smiths, weavers,\r\napothecaries. It was necessary to assert the dignity of those arts, to\r\nbring them prominently forward, to proclaim that, as they have a\r\nmost serious effect on human happiness, they are not unworthy of\r\nthe attention of the highest human intellects. Again, it was by\r\nillustrations drawn from these arts that Bacon could most easily\r\nillustrate his principles. It was by improvements effected in these\r\narts that the soundness of his principles could be most speedily\r\nand decisively brought to the test, and made manifest to common\r\nunderstandings. He acted like a wise commander who thins every other\r\n\r\n     (1) _Cogitata_. The expression _opinio humida_ may surprise\r\n     a reader not accustomed to Bacon’s style. The allusion is to\r\n     the maxim of Heraclitus the obscure: “Dry light is the\r\n     best.” By dry light, Bacon understood the light of the\r\n     intellect, not obscured by the mists of passion, interest,\r\n     or prejudice\r\n\r\n{467}part of his line to strengthen a point where the enemy is attacking\r\nwith peculiar fury, and on the fate of which the event of the battle\r\nseems likely to depend. In the _Novum Organum_, however, he distinctly\r\nand most truly declares that his philosophy is no less a Moral than\r\na Natural Philosophy, that, though his illustrations are drawn from\r\nphysical science, the principles which those illustrations are intended\r\nto explain are just as applicable to ethical and political inquiries as\r\nto inquiries into the nature of heat and vegetation. (1)\r\n\r\nHe frequently treated of moral subjects; and he brought to those\r\nsubjects that spirit which was the essence of his whole system. He has\r\nleft us many admirable practicable observations on what he somewhat\r\nquaintly called the Georgies of the mind, on the mental culture which\r\ntends to produce good dispositions. Some persons, he said, might accuse\r\nhim of spending labour on a matter so simple that his predecessors had\r\npassed it by with contempt. He desired such persons to remember that\r\nhe had from the first announced the objects of his search to be not\r\nthe splendid and the surprising, but the useful and the true, not the\r\ndeluding dreams which go forth through the shining portal of ivory, but\r\nthe humbler realities of the gate of horn. (2)\r\n\r\nTrue to this principle, he indulged in no rants about the fitness of\r\nthings, the all-sufficiency of virtue, and the dignity of human nature.\r\nHe dealt not at all in resounding nothings, such as those with which\r\nBoling-broke pretended to comfort himself in exile, and in which Cicero\r\nvainly sought consolation after the loss of Tullia. The casuistical\r\nsubtilties which occupied the\r\n\r\n     (1) _Novum Organum_, Lib. 1. Aph. 127.\r\n\r\n     (2) _De Augmentis_, Lib. 7. Cap. 3.\r\n\r\n{468}attention of the keenest spirits of his age had, it should seem, no\r\nattractions for him. The doctors whom Escobar afterwards compared to\r\nthe four beasts and the four-and-twenty elders in the Apocalypse Bacon\r\ndismissed with most contemptuous brevity. “Inanes plerumque evadunt\r\net futiles.” (1) Nor did he ever meddle with those enigmas which have\r\npuzzled hundreds of generations, and will puzzle hundreds more. He said\r\nnothing about the grounds of moral obligation, or the freedom of\r\nthe human will. He had no inclination to employ himself in labours\r\nresembling those of the damned in the Grecian Tartarus, to spin for ever\r\non the same wheel round the same pivot, to gape for ever after the\r\nsame deluding clusters, to pour water for ever into the same bottomless\r\nbuckets, to pace for ever to and fro on the same wearisome path after\r\nthe same recoiling stone. He exhorted his disciples to prosecute\r\nresearches of a very different description, to consider moral science\r\nas a practical science, a science of which the object was to cure the\r\ndiseases and perturbations of the mind, and which could be improved only\r\nby a method analogous to that which has improved medicine and surgery.\r\nMoral philosophers ought, he said, to set themselves vigorously to work\r\nfor the purpose of discovering what are the actual effects produced on\r\nthe human character by particular modes of education, by the indulgence\r\nof particular habits, by the study of particular books, by society, by\r\nemulation, by imitation. Then we might hope to find out what mode of\r\ntraining was most likely to preserve and restore moral health. (2)\r\n\r\nWhat he was as a natural philosopher and a moral philosopher, that he\r\nwas also as a theologian. He was,\r\n\r\n     (1) _Ib_., Lib. 7. Cap. 2.\r\n\r\n     (2) _De Augmentis_, Lib. 7. Cap. 3.\r\n\r\n{469}we are convinced, a sincere believer in the divine authority of the\r\nChristian revelation. Nothing can be found in his writings, or in any\r\nother writings, more eloquent and pathetic than some passages which were\r\napparently written under the influence of strong devotional feeling.\r\nHe loved to dwell on the power of the Christian religion to effect much\r\nthat the ancient philosophers could only promise. He loved to consider\r\nthat religion as the bond of charity, the curb of evil passions, the\r\nconsolation of the wretched, the support of the timid, the hope of the\r\ndying. But controversies on speculative points of theology seem to\r\nhave engaged scarcely any portion of his attention. In what he wrote\r\non Church Government he showed, as far as he dared, a tolerant and\r\ncharitable spirit. He troubled himself not at all about Homoousians and\r\nHomoionsians, Monothelites and Nestorians. He lived in an age in which\r\ndisputes on the most subtle points of divinity excited an intense\r\ninterest throughout Europe, and nowhere more than in England. He was\r\nplaced in the very thick of the conflict. He was in power at the time\r\nof the Synod of Dort, and must for months have been daily deafened with\r\ntalk about election, reprobation, and final perseverance. Yet we do not\r\nremember a line in his works from which it can be inferred that he was\r\neither a Calvinist or an Arminian. While the world was resounding with\r\nthe noise of a disputatious philosophy and a disputatious theology,\r\nthe Baconian school, like Alworthy seated between Square and Thwackum,\r\npreserved a calm neutrality, half scornful, half benevolent, and,\r\ncontent with adding to the sum of practical good, left the war of words\r\nto those who liked it.\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt long on the end of the Baconian {470}philosophy, because\r\nfrom this peculiarity all the other peculiarities of that philosophy\r\nnecessarily arose. Indeed, scarcely any person who proposed to himself\r\nthe same end with Bacon could fail to hit upon the same means.\r\n\r\nThe vulgar notion about Bacon we take to be this, that he invented a new\r\nmethod of arriving at truth, which method is called Induction, and that\r\nhe detected some fallacy in the syllogistic reasoning which had been in\r\nvogue before his time. This notion is about as well founded as that of\r\nthe people who, in the middle ages, imagined that Virgil was a great\r\nconjurer. Many who are far too well informed to talk such extravagant\r\nnonsense entertain what we think incorrect notions as to what Bacon\r\nreally effected in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe inductive method has been practised ever since the beginning of\r\nthe world by every human being. It is constantly practised by the most\r\nignorant clown, by the most thoughtless schoolboy, by the very child\r\nat the breast. That method leads the clown to the conclusion that if he\r\nsows barley he shall not reap wheat. By that method the schoolboy learns\r\nthat a cloudy day is the best for catching trout. The very infant, we\r\nimagine, is led by induction to expect milk from his mother or nurse,\r\nand none from his father.\r\n\r\nNot only is it not true that Bacon invented the inductive method; but\r\nit is not true that he was the first person who correctly analysed that\r\nmethod and explained its uses. Aristotle had long before pointed out the\r\nabsurdity of supposing that syllogistic reasoning could ever conduct men\r\nto the discovery of any new principle, had shown that such discoveries\r\nmust be made by induction, and by induction alone, and had given the\r\nhistory of the inductive process, concisely indeed, but with great\r\nperspicuity and precision. {471}Again, we are not inclined to ascribe\r\nmuch practical value to that analysis of the inductive method which\r\nBacon has given in the second book of the _Novum Organum_. It is indeed\r\nan elaborate and correct analysis. But it is an analysis of that which\r\nwe are all doing from morning to night, and which we continue to do\r\neven in our dreams. A plain man finds his stomach out of order. He never\r\nheard Lord Bacon’s name. But he proceeds in the strictest conformity\r\nwith the rules laid down in the second book of the Novum Organum, and\r\nsatisfies himself that minced pies have done the mischief. “I ate minced\r\npies on Monday and Wednesday, and I was kept awake by indigestion\r\nall night.” This is the comparentia ad intellectual instantiarum\r\nconvenientium. “I did not eat any on Tuesday and Friday, and I was quite\r\nwell.” This is the comparentia instantiarum in proximo qua natura\r\ndata privantur. “I ate very sparingly of them on Sunday, and was very\r\nslightly indisposed in the evening. But on Christmas-day I almost\r\ndined on them, and was so ill that I was in great danger.” This is the\r\n_comparentia instantiarum secundum magis et minus_. “It cannot have been\r\nthe brandy which I took with them. For I have drunk brandy daily for\r\nyears without being the worse for it.” This is the _rejectio naturarum_.\r\nOur invalid then proceeds to what is termed by Bacon the _Vindemiatio_,\r\nand pronounces that minced pies do not agree with him.\r\n\r\nWe repeat that we dispute neither the ingenuity nor the accuracy of the\r\ntheory contained in the second book of the _Novum Organum_; but we think\r\nthat Bacon greatly overrated its utility. We conceive that the inductive\r\nprocess, like many other processes, is not likely to be better performed\r\nmerely because men know {472}how they perform it. William Tell would not\r\nhave been one whit more likely to cleave the apple if he had known\r\nthat his arrow would describe a parabola under the influence of the\r\nattraction of the earth. Captain Barclay would not have been more likely\r\nto walk a thousand miles in a thousand hours, if he had known the place\r\nand name of every muscle in his legs. Monsieur Jourdain probably did not\r\npronounce D and F more correctly after he had been apprised that D is\r\npronounced by touching the teeth with the end of the tongue, and F by\r\nputting the upper teeth on the lower lip. We cannot perceive that the\r\nstudy of Grammar makes the smallest difference in the speech of people\r\nwho have always lived in good society. Not one Londoner in ten thousand\r\ncan lay down the rules for the proper use of will and shall. Yet not\r\none Londoner in a million ever misplaces his will and shall. Doctor\r\nRobertson could, undoubtedly, have written a luminous dissertation on\r\nthe use of’ those words. Yet, even in his latest work, he sometimes\r\nmisplaced them ludicrously. No man uses figures of speech with more\r\npropriety because he knows that one figure is called a metonymy and\r\nanother a synecdoche. A drayman in a passion calls out, “You are a\r\npretty fellow,” without suspecting that he is uttering irony, and that\r\nirony is one of the four primary tropes. The old systems of rhetoric\r\nwere never regarded by the most experienced and discerning judges as of\r\nany use for the purpose of forming an orator-“Ego liane vim intelligo,”\r\n said Cicero, “esse in præceptis omnibus, non ut ea secuti oratores\r\neloquentiæ landem sint adepti, sed quæ sua sponte homines éloquentes\r\nfacerent, ea quosdam observasse, atque id egisse; sic esse non\r\neloquentiam ex artificio, sed artificium ex eloqnentia natum.” We must\r\nown that we {473}entertain the same opinion concerning the study of\r\nLogic which Cicero entertained concerning the study of Rhetoric. A\r\nman of sense syllogizes in _celarent_ and sesare all day long without\r\nsuspecting it; and, though he may not know what an _ignoratio clenchi_\r\nis, has no difficulty in exposing it whenever he falls in with it; which\r\nis likely to be as often as he falls in with a Reverend Master of Arts\r\nnourished on mode and figure in the cloisters of Oxford. Considered\r\nmerely as an intellectual feat, the _Organum_ of Aristotle can\r\nscarcely be admired too highly. But the more we compare individual with\r\nindividual, school with school, nation with nation, generation with\r\ngeneration, the more do we lean to the opinion that the knowledge of the\r\ntheory of logic has no tendency whatever to make men good reasoners.\r\n\r\nWhat Aristotle did for the syllogistic process Bacon has, in the second\r\nbook of the _Novum Organum_, done for the inductive process; that is to\r\nsay, he has analysed it well. His rules are quite proper; but we do not\r\nneed them, because they are drawn from our own constant practice.\r\n\r\nBut, though everybody is constantly performing the process described\r\nin the second book of the _Novum Organum_, some men perform it well and\r\nsome perform it ill. Some are led by it to truth, and some to error. It\r\nled Franklin to discover the nature of lightning. It led thousands, who\r\nhad less brains than Franklin, to believe in animal magnetism. But this\r\nwas not because Franklin went through the process described by Bacon,\r\nand the dupes of Mesmer through a different process. The _comparentiæ_\r\nand _rejectiones_ of which we have given examples will be found in the\r\nmost unsound inductions. We have heard that an eminent judge of {474}the\r\nlast generation was in the habit of jocosely propounding after dinner a\r\ntheory, that the cause of the prevalence of Jacobinism was the practice\r\nof bearing three names. He quoted on the one side Charles James Fox,\r\nRichard Brinsley Sheridan, John Horne Tooke, John Philpot Curran,\r\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, Theobald Wolfe Tone. These were _instantiae\r\nconvenientes_. He then proceeded to cite instances _absentio in\r\nproximo_, William Pitt, John Scott, William Windham, Samuel Horsley,\r\nHenry Dundas, Edmund Burke. He might have gone on to instances _secundum\r\nmagis et minus_. The practice of giving children three names has been\r\nfor some time a growing practice, and Jacobinism has also been growing.\r\nThe practice of giving children three names is more common in America\r\nthan in England. In England we still have a King and a House of Lords;\r\nbut the Americans are republicans. The rejectiones are obvious. Burke\r\nand Theobald Wolfe Tone are both Irishmen; therefore the being an\r\nIrishman is not the cause of Jacobinism. Horsley and Horne Tooke are\r\nboth clergymen; therefore the being a clergyman is not the cause of\r\nJacobinism. Fox and Windham were both educated at Oxford; therefore the\r\nbeing educated at Oxford is not the cause of Jacobinism. Pitt and Horne\r\nTooke were both educated at Cambridge; therefore the being educated at\r\nCambridge is not the cause of Jacobinism. In this way, our inductive\r\nphilosopher arrives at what Bacon calls the Vintage, and pronounces that\r\nthe having three names is the cause of Jacobinism.\r\n\r\nHere is an induction corresponding with Bacon’s analysis and ending in\r\na monstrous absurdity. In what then does this induction differ from the\r\ninduction which leads us to the conclusion that the presence {475}of\r\nthe sun is the cause of our having more light by day than by night? The\r\ndifference evidently is not in the kind of instances, but in the number\r\nof instances; that is to say, the difference is not in that part of the\r\nprocess for which Bacon has given precise rules, but in a circumstance\r\nfor which no precise rule can possibly be given. If the learned author\r\nof the theory about Jacobinism had enlarged either of his tables a\r\nlittle, his system would have been destroyed. The names of Tom Paine and\r\nWilliam Wyndham Grenville would have been sufficient to do the work.\r\n\r\nIt appears to us, then, that the difference between a sound and unsound\r\ninduction does not lie in this, that the author of the sound induction\r\ngoes through the process analysed in the second book of the _Novum\r\nOrganum_, and the author of the unsound induction through a different\r\nprocess. They both perform the same process. But one performs it\r\nfoolishly or carelessly; the other performs it with patience, attention,\r\nsagacity, and judgment. Now precepts can do little towards making men\r\npatient and attentive, and still less towards making them sagacious\r\nand judicious. It is very well to tell men to be on their guard against\r\nprejudices, not to believe facts on slight evidence, not to be content\r\nwith a scanty collection of facts, to put out of their minds the _idola_\r\nwhich Bacon has so finely described. But these rules are too general to\r\nbe of much practical use. The question is, What is a prejudice? How long\r\ndoes the incredulity with which I hear a new theory propounded continue\r\nto be a wise and salutary incredulity? When does it become an _idolum\r\nspecus_, the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind? What is\r\nslight evidence? What collection of facts is scanty? Will ten instances\r\ndo, or fifty, or a hundred? In how many {476}months would the first\r\nhuman beings who settled on the shores of the ocean have been justified\r\nin believing that the moon had an influence on the tides? After how many\r\nexperiments would Jenner have been justified in believing that he had\r\ndiscovered a safeguard against the small-pox? These are questions to\r\nwhich it would be most desirable to have a precise answer; but unhappily\r\nthey are questions to which no precise answer can be returned.\r\n\r\nWe think then that it is possible to lay down accurate rules, as Bacon\r\nhas done, for the performing of that part of the inductive process which\r\nall men perform alike; but that these rules, though accurate, are not\r\nwanted, because in truth they only tell us to do what we are all doing.\r\nWe think that it is impossible to lay down any precise rule for\r\nthe performing of that part of the inductive process which a great\r\nexperimental philosopher performs in one way, and a superstitious old\r\nwoman in another.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, we think, Bacon was in an error. He certainly\r\nattributed to his rules a value which did not belong to them. He went so\r\nfar as to say, that, if his method of making discoveries were adopted,\r\nlittle would depend on the degree of force or acuteness of any\r\nintellect; that all minds would be reduced to one level, that his\r\nphilosophy resembled a compass or a rule which equalises all hands, and\r\nenables the most unpractised person to draw a more correct circle or\r\nline than the best draughtsmen can produce without such aid. (1) This\r\nreally seems to us as extravagant as it would have been in Lindley\r\nMurray to announce that everybody who should learn his Grammar would\r\nwrite as good English as Dryden, or in that very able writer,\r\n\r\n     (1) _Novum Organum_, Præf. and Lib. 1. Aph. 122.\r\n\r\n{477}the Archbishop of Dublin, to promise that all the readers of his\r\nLogic would reason like Chillingworth, and that all the readers of his\r\nRhetoric would speak like Burke. That Bacon was altogether mistaken as\r\nto this point will now hardly be disputed. His philosophy has flourished\r\nduring two hundred years, and has produced none of this levelling. The\r\ninterval between a man of talents and a dunce is as wide as ever; and is\r\nnever more clearly discernible than when they engage in researches which\r\nrequire the constant use of induction.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that we do not consider Bacon’s ingenious analysis of\r\nthe inductive method as a very useful performance. Bacon was not, as we\r\nhave already said, the inventor of the inductive method. He was not even\r\nthe person who first analysed the inductive method correctly, though he\r\nundoubtedly analysed it more minutely than any who preceded him. He was\r\nnot the person who first showed that by the inductive method alone new\r\ntruth could be discovered. But he was the person who first turned the\r\nminds of speculative men, long occupied in verbal disputes, to the\r\ndiscovery of new and useful truth; and, by doing so, he at once gave to\r\nthe inductive method an importance and dignity which had never before\r\nbelonged to it. He was not the maker of that road; he was not the\r\ndiscoverer of that road; he was not the person who first surveyed and\r\nmapped that road. But he was the person who first called the public\r\nattention to an inexhaustible mine of wealth, which had been utterly\r\nneglected, and which was accessible by that road alone. By doing so, he\r\ncaused that road, which had previously been trodden only by peasants and\r\nhigglers, to be frequented by a higher class of travellers.\r\n\r\nThat which was eminently his own in his system {478}was the end which\r\nhe proposed to himself. The end being given, the means, as it appears to\r\nus, could not well be mistaken. If others had aimed at the same object\r\nwith Bacon, we hold it to be certain that they would have employed the\r\nsame method with Bacon. It would have been hard to convince Seneca\r\nthat the inventing of a safety-lamp was an employment worthy of a\r\nphilosopher. It would have been hard to persuade Thomas Aquinas to\r\ndescend from the making of syllogisms to the making of gunpowder. But\r\nSeneca would never have doubted for a moment that it was only by means\r\nof a series of experiments that a safety-lamp could be invented. Thomas\r\nAquinas would never have thought that his _barbara_ and _baralipton_\r\nwould enable him to ascertain the proportion which charcoal ought to\r\nbear to saltpetre in a pound of gunpowder. Neither common sense nor\r\nAristotle would have suffered him to fall into such an absurdity.\r\n\r\nBy stimulating men to the discovery of new truth, Bacon stimulated\r\nthem to employ the inductive method, the only method, even the ancient\r\nphilosophers and the schoolmen themselves being judges, by which new\r\ntruth can be discovered. By stimulating men to the discovery of useful\r\ntruth, he furnished them with a motive to perform the inductive process\r\nwell and carefully. His predecessors had been, in his phrase, not\r\ninterpreters, but anticipators of nature. They had been content with\r\nthe first principles at which they had arrived by the most scanty and\r\nslovenly induction. And why was this? It was, we conceive, because their\r\nphilosophy proposed to itself no practical end, because it was merely an\r\nexercise of the mind. A man who wants to contrive a new machine or a new\r\nmedicine has a strong motive to observe accurately and {479}patiently,\r\nand to try experiment after experiment. But a man who merely wants a\r\ntheme for disputation or declamation has no such motive. He is therefore\r\ncontent with premises grounded on assumption, or on the most scanty\r\nand hasty induction. Thus, we conceive, the schoolmen acted. On their\r\nfoolish premises they often argued with great ability; and as their\r\nobject was “assensum subjugare, non res,” (1) to be victorious in\r\ncontroversy, not to be victorious over nature, they were consistent. For\r\njust as much logical skill could be shown in reasoning on false as on\r\ntrue premises. But the followers of the new philosophy, proposing to\r\nthemselves the discovery of useful truth as their object, must have\r\naltogether failed of attaining that object if they had been content to\r\nbuild theories on superficial induction.\r\n\r\nBacon has remarked (2) that in ages when philosophy was stationary, the\r\nmechanical arts went on improving. Why was this? Evidently because the\r\nmechanic was not content with so careless a mode of induction as served\r\nthe purpose of the philosopher. And why was the philosopher more\r\neasily satisfied than the mechanic? Evidently because the object of the\r\nmechanic was to mould things, whilst the object of the philosopher was\r\nonly to mould words. Careful induction is not at all necessary to the\r\nmaking of a good syllogism. But it is indispensable to the making of a\r\ngood shoe. Mechanics, therefore, have always been, as far as the range\r\nof their humble but useful callings extended, not anticipators but\r\ninterpreters of nature. And when a philosophy arose, the object of which\r\nwas to do on a large scale what the mechanic does on a small scale, to\r\n\r\n     (1) _Novum Organum_, Lib. 1. Aph. 29.\r\n\r\n     (2) _De Augmentis_, Lib. 1.\r\n\r\n{480}extend the power and to supply the wants of man, the truth of the\r\npremises, which logically is a matter altogether unimportant, became a\r\nmatter of the highest importance; and the careless induction with which\r\nmen of learning had previously been satisfied gave place, of necessity,\r\nto an induction far more accurate and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWhat Bacon did for inductive philosophy may, we think, be fairly stated\r\nthus. The objects of preceding speculators were objects which could be\r\nattained without careful induction. Those speculators, therefore, did\r\nnot perform the inductive process carefully. Bacon stirred up men to\r\npursue an object which could be attained only by induction, and by\r\ninduction carefully performed; and consequently induction was more\r\ncarefully performed. We do not think that the importance of what Bacon\r\ndid for inductive philosophy has ever been overrated. But we think\r\nthat the nature of his services is often mistaken, and was not fully\r\nunderstood even by himself. It was not by furnishing philosophers with\r\nrules for performing the inductive process well, but by furnishing\r\nthem with a motive for performing it well, that he conferred so vast a\r\nbenefit on society.\r\n\r\nTo give to the human mind a direction which it shall retain for ages is\r\nthe rare prerogative of a few imperial spirits. It cannot, therefore,\r\nbe uninteresting to inquire what was the moral and intellectual\r\nconstitution which enabled Bacon to exercise so vast an influence on the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn the temper of Bacon,--we speak of Bacon the philosopher, not of Bacon\r\nthe lawyer and politician,--there was a singular union of audacity and\r\nsobriety. The promises which he made to mankind might, to a superficial\r\nreader, seem to resemble the rants which a {481}great dramatist has put\r\ninto the mouth of an Oriental conqueror half-crazed by good fortune and\r\nby violent passions.\r\n\r\n                   “He shall have chariots easier than air,\r\n\r\n                   Which I will have invented; and thyself\r\n\r\n                   That art the messenger shall ride before him,\r\n\r\n                   On a horse cut out of an entire diamond,\r\n\r\n                   That shall be made to go with golden wheels,\r\n\r\n                   I know not how yet.”\r\n\r\nBut Bacon performed what he promised. In truth, Fletcher would not have\r\ndared to make Arbaces promise, in his wildest fits of excitement, the\r\ntithe of what the Baconian philosophy has performed.\r\n\r\nThe true philosophical temperament may, we think, be described in four\r\nwords, much hope, little faith; a disposition to believe that any thing,\r\nhowever extraordinary, may be done; an indisposition to believe that any\r\nthing extraordinary has been done. In these points the constitution of\r\nBacon’s mind seems to us to have been absolutely perfect. He was at once\r\nthe Mammon and the Surly of his friend Ben. Sir Epicure did not indulge\r\nin visions more magnificent and gigantic. Surly did not sift evidence\r\nwith keener and more sagacious incredulity.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this peculiarity of Bacon’s temper was a striking\r\npeculiarity of his understanding. With great minuteness of observation\r\nhe had an amplitude of comprehension such as has never yet been\r\nvouchsafed to any other human being. The small fine mind of Labruyère\r\nhad not a more delicate tact than the large intellect of Bacon. The\r\nEssays contain abundant proofs that no nice feature of character, no\r\npeculiarity in the ordering of a house, a garden, or a court-masque,\r\ncould escape the notice of one whose {482}mind was capable of taking in\r\nthe whole world of knowledge. His understanding resembled the tent which\r\nthe fairy Paribanou gave to Prince Ahmed. Fold it; and it seemed a toy\r\nfor the hand of a lady. Spread it; and the armies of powerful Sultans\r\nmight repose beneath its shade.\r\n\r\nIn keenness of observation he has been equalled, though perhaps never\r\nsurpassed. But the largeness of his mind was all his own. The glance\r\nwith which he surveyed the intellectual universe resembled that which\r\nthe Archangel, from the golden threshold of heaven, darted down into the\r\nnew creation.\r\n\r\n               ’Round he surveyed,--and well might, where he stood\r\n\r\n               So high above the circling canopy\r\n\r\n               Of night’s extended shade,--from eastern point\r\n\r\n               Of Libra, to the fleecy star which bears\r\n\r\n               Andromeda far off Atlantic seas\r\n\r\n               Beyond the horizon.”\r\n\r\nHis knowledge differed from that of other men, as a terrestrial globe\r\ndiffers from an Atlas which contains a different country on every leaf.\r\nThe towns and roads of England, France, and Germany are better laid down\r\nin the Atlas than on the globe. But while we are looking at England we\r\nsee nothing of France; and while we are looking at France we see nothing\r\nof Germany. We may go to the Atlas to learn the bearings and distances\r\nof York and Bristol, or of Dresden and Prague. But it is useless if we\r\nwant to know the bearings and distances of France and Martinique, or of\r\nEngland and Canada. On the globe we shall not find all the market towns\r\nin our own neighbourhood; but we shall learn from it the comparative\r\nextent and the relative position of all the kingdoms of the earth.\r\n“I have taken,” said Bacon, in a letter {483}written when he was only\r\nthirty-one, to his uncle Lord Burleigh, “I have taken all knowledge to\r\nbe my province.” In any other young man, indeed in any other man, this\r\nwould have been a ridiculous flight of presumption. There have been\r\nthousands of better mathematicians, astronomers, chemists, physicians,\r\nbotanists, mineralogists, than Bacon. No man would go to Bacon’s works\r\nto learn any particular science or art, any more than he would go to a\r\ntwelve-inch globe in order to find his way from Kennington turnpike to\r\nClapham Common. The art which Bacon taught was the art of inventing\r\narts. The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge of\r\nthe mutual relations of all departments of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which he communicated his thoughts was peculiar to him. He\r\nhad no touch of that disputatious temper which he often censured in his\r\npredecessors. He effected a vast intellectual revolution in opposition\r\nto a vast mass of prejudices; yet he never engaged in any controversy:\r\nnay, we cannot at present recollect, in all his philosophical works, a\r\nsingle passage of a controversial character. All those works might\r\nwith propriety have been put into the form which he adopted in the work\r\nentitled _Cogitata et visa_: “Francisons Baconus sic cogitavit.” These\r\nare thoughts which have occurred to me: weigh them well: and take them\r\nor leave them.\r\n\r\nBorgia said of the famous expedition of Charles the Eighth, that the\r\nFrench had conquered Italy, not with steel, but with chalk; for that the\r\nonly exploit which they had found necessary for the purpose of taking\r\nmilitary occupation of any place had been to mark the doors of the\r\nhouses where they meant to quarter. Bacon often quoted this saying, and\r\nloved to apply it {484}to the victories of his own intellect. (1) His\r\nphilosophy, he said, came as a guest, not as an enemy. She found\r\nno difficulty in gaining admittance, without a contest, into every\r\nunderstanding fitted, by its structure and by its capacity, to receive\r\nher. In all this we think that he acted most judiciously; first,\r\nbecause, as he has himself remarked, the difference between his school\r\nand other schools was a difference so fundamental that there was hardly\r\nany common ground on which a controversial battle could be fought; and,\r\nsecondly, because his mind, eminently observant, preeminently\r\ndiscursive and capacious, was, we conceive, neither formed by nature nor\r\ndisciplined by habit for dialectical combat.\r\n\r\nThough Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic, he\r\nadorned her profusely with all the richest decorations of rhetoric. His\r\neloquence, though not untainted with the vicious taste of his age, would\r\nalone have entitled him to a high rank in literature. He had a wonderful\r\ntalent for packing thought close, and rendering it portable. In wit, if\r\nby wit be meant the power of perceiving analogies between things which\r\nappear to have nothing in common, he never had an equal, not even\r\nCowley, not even the author of Hudibras. Indeed, he possessed this\r\nfaculty, or rather this faculty possessed him, to a morbid degree. When\r\nhe abandoned himself to it without reserve, as he did in the _Sapientia\r\nVeterum_, and at the end of the second book of the _De Augmentis_, the\r\nfeats which he performed were not merely admirable, but portentous,\r\nand almost shocking. On these occasions we marvel at him as clowns on\r\na fair-day marvel at a juggler, and can hardly help thinking that the\r\ndevil must be in him.\r\n\r\n      (1) _Novum Organum_, Lib. 1. Aph. 35. and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n{485}These, however, were freaks in which his ingenuity now and then\r\nwantoned, with scarcely any other object than to astonish and amuse. But\r\nit occasionally happened that, when he was engaged in grave and\r\nprofound investigations, his wit obtained the mastery over all his other\r\nfaculties, and led him into absurdities into which no dull man could\r\npossibly have fallen. We will give the most striking instance which at\r\npresent occurs to us. In the third book of the _De Augmentis_ he tells\r\nus that there are some principles which are not peculiar to one science,\r\nbut are common to several. That part of philosophy which concerns\r\nitself with these principles is, in his nomenclature, designated as\r\n_philosophia prima_. He then proceeds to mention some of the principles\r\nwith which this _philosophia prima_ is conversant. One of them is this.\r\nAn infectious disease is more likely to be communicated while it is in\r\nprogress than when it has reached its height. This, says he, is true in\r\nmedicine. It is also true in morals; for we see that the example of very\r\nabandoned men injures public morality less than the example of men in\r\nwhom vice has not yet extinguished all good qualities. Again, he tells\r\nus that in music a discord ending in a concord is agreeable, and that\r\nthe same thing may be noted in the affections. Once more, he tells\r\nus, that in physics the energy with which a principle acts is often\r\nincreased by the antiperistasis of its opposite; and that it is\r\nthe same in the contests of factions. If the making of ingenious and\r\nsparkling similitudes like these be indeed the _philosophia prima_, we\r\nare quite sure that the greatest philosophical work of the nineteenth\r\ncentury is Mr. Moore’s Lalla Rookh. The similitudes which we have cited\r\nare very happy similitudes. But that a man like Bacon should have taken\r\nthem for more, that he should have thought the {486}discovery of such\r\nresemblances as these an important part of philosophy, has always\r\nappeared to us one of the most singular facts in the history of letters.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that his mind was wonderfully quick in perceiving analogies\r\nof all sorts. But, like several eminent men whom we could name, both\r\nliving and dead, he sometimes appeared strangely deficient in the power\r\nof distinguishing rational from fanciful analogies, analogies which are\r\narguments from analogies which are mere illustrations, analogies like\r\nthat which Bishop Butler so ably pointed out, between natural and\r\nrevealed religion, from analogies like that which Addison discovered,\r\nbetween the series of Grecian gods carved by Phidias and the series of\r\nEnglish kings painted by Kneller. This want of discrimination has led to\r\nmany strange political speculations. Sir William Temple deduced a theory\r\nof government from the properties of the pyramid. Mr. Southey’s whole\r\nsystem of finance is grounded on the phænomena of evaporation and rain.\r\nIn theology, this perverted ingenuity has made still wilder work. From\r\nthe time of Iremeus and Origen down to the present day, there has not\r\nbeen a single generation in which great divines have not been led\r\ninto the most absurd expositions of Scripture, by mere incapacity\r\nto distinguish analogies proper, to use the scholastic phrase, from\r\nanalogies metaphorical. (1) It is curious that Bacon has himself\r\nmentioned this very kind of delusion among the _idola specus_; and has\r\nmentioned in language which, we are inclined to think, shows that he\r\nknew himself to be subject to it. It is the vice, he tells us, of subtle\r\nminds to attach too much importance to slight distinctions; it, is the\r\nvice, on the other hand, of high and discursive\r\n\r\n     (1) See some interesting remark? on this subject in Bishop\r\n     Berkeley’s Minute Philosopher, Dialogue IV.\r\n\r\n{487}intellects to attach too much importance to slight resemblances;\r\nand he adds that, when this last propensity is indulged to excess, it\r\nleads men to catch at shadows instead of substances. (1)\r\n\r\nYet we cannot wish that Bacon’s wit had been less luxuriant. For, to say\r\nnothing of the pleasure which it affords, it was in the vast majority of\r\ncases employed for the purpose of making obscure truth plain, of making\r\nrepulsive truth attractive, of fixing in the mind forever truth which\r\nmight otherwise have left but a transient impression.\r\n\r\nThe poetical faculty was powerful in Bacon’s mind, but not, like his\r\nwit, so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason, and\r\nto tyrannize over the whole man. No imagination was ever at once so\r\nstrong and so thoroughly subjugated. It never stirred but at a signal\r\nfrom good sense. It stopped at the first check from good sense. Yet,\r\nthough disciplined to such obedience, it gave noble proofs of its\r\nvigour. In truth, much of Bacon’s life was passed in a visionary world,\r\namidst things as strange as any that are described in the Arabian Tales,\r\nor in those romances on which the curate and barber of Don Quixote’s\r\nvillage performed so cruel an auto-de-fe, amidst buildings more\r\nsumptuous than the palace of Aladdin, fountains more wonderful than the\r\ngolden water of Parizade, conveyances more rapid than the hippogryph of\r\nRuggiero, arms more formidable than the lance of Astolfo, remedies\r\nmore efficacious than the balsam of Fierabras. Yet in his magnificent\r\nday-dreams there was nothing wild, nothing but what sober reason\r\nsanctioned. He knew that all the secrets feigned by poets to have been\r\nwritten in the books of enchanters are worthless when compared\r\n\r\n     (1) _Novum Organum_, Lib. 1. Aph. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n{488}with the mighty secrets which are really written in the book of\r\nnature, and which, with time and patience, will be read there. He knew\r\nthat all the wonders wrought by all the talismans in fable were trifles\r\nwhen compared to the wonders which might reasonably be expected from the\r\nphilosophy of fruit, and that, if his words sank deep into the minds of\r\nmen, they would produce effects such as superstition had never ascribed\r\nto the incantations of Merlin and Michael Scot. It was here that he\r\nloved to let his imagination loose. He loved to picture to himself\r\nthe world as it would be when his philosophy should, in his own noble\r\nphrase, “have enlarged the bounds of human empire.” (1) We might refer\r\nto many instances. But we will content ourselves with the strongest,\r\nthe description of the House of Solomon in the New Atlantis. By most of\r\nBacon’s contemporaries, and by some people of our time, this remarkable\r\npassage would, we doubt not, be considered as an ingenious rodomontade,\r\na counterpart to the adventures of Sinbad or Baron Munchausen. The truth\r\nis, that there is not to be found in any human composition a passage\r\nmore eminently distinguished by profound and serene wisdom. The boldness\r\nand originality of the fiction is far less wonderful than the nice\r\ndiscernment which carefully excluded from that long list of prodigies\r\nevery thing that can be pronounced impossible, every thing that can be\r\nproved to lie beyond the mighty magic of induction and of time. Already\r\nsome parts, and not the least startling parts, of this glorious prophecy\r\nhave been accomplished, even according to the letter; and the whole,\r\nconstrued according to the spirit, is daily accomplishing all around us.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable circumstances in the\r\n\r\n      (1) New Atlantis.\r\n\r\n{489}history of Bacon’s mind is the order in which its powers expanded\r\nthemselves. With him the fruit came first and remained till the last;\r\nthe blossoms did not appear till late. In general, the development of\r\nthe fancy is to the development of the judgment what the growth of a\r\ngirl is to the growth of a boy. The fancy attains at an earlier period\r\nto the perfection of its beauty, its power, and its fruitfulness; and,\r\nas it is first to ripen, it is also first to fade. It has generally lost\r\nsomething of its bloom and freshness before the sterner faculties\r\nhave reached maturity; and is commonly withered and barren while those\r\nfaculties still retain all their energy. It rarely happens that the\r\nfancy and the judgment grow together. It happens still more rarely that\r\nthe judgment grows faster than the fancy. This seems, however, to have\r\nbeen the case with Bacon. His boyhood and youth appear to have been\r\nsingularly sedate. His gigantic scheme of philosophical reform is said\r\nby some writers to have been planned before he was fifteen, and was\r\nundoubtedly planned while he was still young. He observed as vigilantly,\r\nmeditated as deeply, and judged as temperately when he gave his first\r\nwork to the world as at the close of his long career. But in eloquence,\r\nin sweetness and variety of expression, and in richness of illustration,\r\nhis later writings are far superior to those of his youth. In this\r\nrespect the history of his mind bears some resemblance to the history\r\nof the mind of Burke. The treatise on the Sublime and Beautiful, though\r\nwritten on a subject which the coldest metaphysician could hardly treat\r\nwithout being occasionally betrayed into florid writing, is the most\r\nunadorned of all Burke’s works. It appeared when he was twenty-five or\r\ntwenty-six. When, at forty, he wrote the Thoughts on the Causes of the\r\nexisting Discontents, {490}his reason and his judgment had readied\r\ntheir full maturity; but his eloquence was still in its splendid dawn.\r\nAt fifty, his rhetoric was quite as rich as good taste would permit; and\r\nwhen he died, at almost seventy, it had become ungracefully gorgeous. In\r\nhis youth he wrote on the emotions produced by mountains and cascades,\r\nby the master-pieces of painting and sculpture, by the faces and necks\r\nof beautiful women, in the style of a Parliamentary report. In his old\r\nage he discussed treaties and tariffs in the most fervid and brilliant\r\nlanguage of romance. It is strange that the Essay on the Sublime and\r\nBeautiful, and the Letter to a Noble Lord, should be the productions of\r\none man. But it is far more strange that the Essay should have been a\r\nproduction of his youth, and the Letter of his old age.\r\n\r\nWe will give very short specimens of Bacon’s two styles. In 1597, he\r\nwrote thus: “Crafty men contemn studies; simple men admire them; and\r\nwise men use them; for they teach not their own use: that is a wisdom\r\nwithout them, and won by observation. Read not to contradict, nor to\r\nbelieve, but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others\r\nto be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. Reading maketh\r\na full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man. And\r\ntherefore if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if\r\nhe confer little, have a present wit; and if he read little, have much\r\ncunning to seem to know that he doth not. Histories make men wise, poets\r\nwitty, the mathematics subtle, natural philosophy deep, morals grave,\r\nlogic and rhetoric able to contend,” It will hardly be disputed that\r\nthis is a passage to be “chewed and digested.” We do not believe that\r\nThucydides himself {491}has anywhere compressed so much thought into so\r\nsmall a space.\r\n\r\nIn the additions which Bacon afterwards made to the Essays, there is\r\nnothing superior in truth or weight to what we have quoted. But his\r\nstyle was constantly becoming richer and softer. The following passage,\r\nfirst published in 1625, will show the extent of the change: “Prosperity\r\nis the blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is the blessing of the\r\nNew, which carrieth the greater benediction and the clearer evidence of\r\nGod’s favour. Yet, even in the Old Testament, if you listen to David’s\r\nharp you shall hear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the pencil\r\nof the Holy Ghost hath laboured more in describing the afflictions of\r\nJob than the felicities of Solomon. Prosperity is not without many fears\r\nand distastes; and adversity is not without comforts and hopes. We see\r\nin needleworks and embroideries it is more pleasing to have a lively\r\nwork upon a sad and solemn ground, than to have a dark and melancholy\r\nwork upon a lightsome ground. Judge therefore of the pleasure of the\r\nheart by the pleasure of the eye. Certainly virtue is like precious\r\nodours, most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed; for prosperity\r\ndoth best discover vice, but adversity doth best discover virtue.”\r\n\r\nIt is by the Essays that Bacon is best known to the multitude. The\r\n_Novum Organum_ and the _De Augmentis_ are much talked of, but little\r\nread. They have produced indeed a vast effect on the opinions of\r\nmankind; but they have produced it through the operation of intermediate\r\nagents. They have moved the intellects which have moved the world. It\r\nis in the Essays alone that the mind of Bacon is brought into immediate\r\ncontact with the minds of ordinary readers. There he {492}opens an\r\nexoteric school, and talks to plain men, in language which everybody\r\nunderstands, about things in which everybody is interested. He has thus\r\nenabled those who must otherwise have taken his merits on trust to\r\njudge for themselves; and the great body of readers have, during\r\nseveral generations, acknowledged that the man who has treated with such\r\nconsummate ability questions with which they are familiar may well be\r\nsupposed to deserve all the praise bestowed on him by those who have sat\r\nin his inner school.\r\n\r\nWithout any disparagement to the admirable treatise _De Augmentis_,\r\nwe must say that, in our judgment, Bacon’s greatest performance is\r\nthe first book of the _Novum Organum_. All the peculiarities of his\r\nextraordinary mind are found there in the highest perfection. Many of\r\nthe aphorisms, but particularly those in which he gives examples of the\r\ninfluence of the _idola_, show a nicety of observation that has never\r\nbeen surpassed. Every part of the book blazes with wit, but with wit\r\nwhich is employed only to illustrate and decorate truth. No book ever\r\nmade so great a revolution in the mode of thinking, overthrew so many\r\nprejudices, introduced so many new opinions. Yet no book was ever\r\nwritten in a less contentious spirit. It truly conquers with chalk and\r\nnot with steel. Proposition after proposition enters into the mind,\r\nis received not as an invader, but as a welcome friend, and though\r\npreviously unknown, becomes at once domesticated. But what we most\r\nadmire is the vast capacity of that intellect which, without effort,\r\ntakes in at once all the domains of science, all the past, the\r\npresent, and the future, all the errors of two thousand years, all the\r\nencouraging signs of the passing times, all the bright hopes of the\r\ncoming age. Cowley, who was among the most ardent, and not {493}among\r\nthe least discerning followers of the new philosophy, has, in one of his\r\nfinest poems, compared Bacon to Moses standing on Mount Pisgah. It is to\r\nBacon, we think, as he appears in the first book of the _Novum Organum_,\r\nthat the comparison applies with peculiar felicity. There we see the\r\ngreat Lawgiver looking round from his lonely elevation on an infinite\r\nexpanse; behind him a wilderness of dreary sands, and bitter waters, in\r\nwhich successive generations have sojourned, always moving, yet never\r\nadvancing, reaping no harvest, and building no abiding city; before him\r\na goodly land, a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey.\r\nWhile the multitude below saw only the flat sterile desert in which\r\nthey had so long wandered, bounded on every side by a near horizon,\r\nor diversified only by some deceitful mirage, he was gazing from a far\r\nhigher stand on a far lovelier country, following with his eye the long\r\ncourse of fertilising rivers, through ample pastures, and under the\r\nbridges of great capitals, measuring the distances of marts and havens,\r\nand portioning out all those wealthy regions from Dan to Beersheba.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to turn back from contemplating Bacon’s philosophy to\r\ncontemplate his life. Yet without so turning back it is impossible\r\nfairly to estimate his powers. He left the University at an earlier age\r\nthan that at which most people repair thither. While yet a boy he was\r\nplunged into the midst of diplomatic business. Thence he passed to the\r\nstudy of a vast technical system of law, and worked his way up through a\r\nsuccession of laborious offices, to the highest post in his profession.\r\nIn the mean time he took an active part in every Parliament; he was\r\nan adviser of the Crown: he paid court with the greatest assiduity and\r\naddress to {494}all whose favour was likely to be of use to him;\r\nhe lived much in society; he noted the slightest peculiarities of\r\ncharacter, and the slightest changes of fashion. Scarcely any man has\r\nled a more stirring life than that which Bacon led from sixteen to\r\nsixty. Scarcely any man has been better entitled to be called a thorough\r\nman of the world. The founding of a new philosophy, the imparting of a\r\nnew direction to the minds of speculators, this was the amusement of his\r\nleisure, the work of hours occasionally stolen from the Woolsack and\r\nthe Council Board. This consideration, while it increases the admiration\r\nwith which we regard his intellect, increases also our regret that such\r\nan intellect should so often have been unworthily employed. He well\r\nknew the better course, and had, at one time, resolved to pursue it. “I\r\nconfess,” said he in a letter written when he was still young, “that I\r\nhave as vast contemplative ends as I have moderate civil ends.” Had his\r\ncivil ends continued to be moderate, he would have been, not only the\r\nMoses, but the Joshua of philosophy. He would have fulfilled a\r\nlarge part of his own magnificent predictions. He would have led his\r\nfollowers, not only to the verge, but into the heart of the promised\r\nland. He would not merely have pointed out, but would have divided the\r\nspoil. Above all, he would have left, not only a great, but a spotless\r\nname. Mankind would then have been able to esteem their illustrious\r\nbenefactor. We should not then be compelled to regard his character with\r\nmingled contempt and admiration, with mingled aversion and gratitude.\r\nWe should not then regret that there should be so many proofs of the\r\nnarrowness and selfishness of a heart, the benevolence of which was yet\r\nlarge enough to take in all races and all ages. We {495}should not then\r\nhave to blush for the disingenuousness of the most devoted worshipper\r\nof speculative truth, for the servility of the boldest champion of\r\nintellectual freedom. We should not then have seen the same man at one\r\ntime far in the van, at another time far in the rear of his generation.\r\nWe should not then be forced to own that he who first treated\r\nlegislation as a science was among the last Englishmen who used the\r\nrack, that he who first summoned philosophers to the great work of\r\ninterpreting nature, was among the last Englishmen who sold justice.\r\nAnd we should conclude our survey of a life placidly, honourably,\r\nbeneficently passed, “in industrious observations, grounded conclusions,\r\nand profitable inventions and discoveries,” (1) with feelings very\r\ndifferent from those with which we now turn away from the checkered\r\nspectacle of so much glory and so much shame.\r\n\r\n     (1)  From a Letter of Bacon to Lord Burleigh.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
