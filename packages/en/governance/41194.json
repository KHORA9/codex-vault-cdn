P.,\r\n\r\n  AND\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM O'BRIEN, M.

GLADSTONE'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. GLADSTONE. In following the right honorable gentleman, I shall only\r\ntouch those portions of his speech which go the heart of the question.\r\nIn my opinion, they constituted a very small part of his address\r\n(_cheers_), the rest being criminatory and incriminatory matter, which,\r\nhowever amusing to a portion of the House, really assists us very little\r\nin getting at the root of the great question before us. I do this\r\nparticularly because there is a great difficulty, owing to the enormous\r\nrange of the question, in confining the debate within the narrow limits\r\nto which we all desire to confine it. My honorable and learned friend,\r\nthe member for Inverness (Mr. Finlay), last night, when no member of the\r\nGovernment seemed in a condition to follow the speech of the honorable\r\nmember for Northeast Cork (Mr. W. O'Brien), (_Opposition cheers_),\r\ngallantly stepped into the breach, and performed that office on behalf\r\nof ministers, which has so often been performed by those who are\r\nsometimes termed \"Dissenting Liberals\"; namely, that of finding\r\nexpedients of defence for the Government which they and their adherents\r\nbehind them have been unable to discover. (_Opposition cheers._) My\r\nhonorable and learned friend said he thought it high time that the\r\ndebate should draw to a close. I can perfectly understand reasons why he\r\nshould desire that there might be no debate at all on this subject\r\n(_laughter and cheers_), but when he says that the discussion has\r\nextended to unreasonable length, I point to the speech of the\r\nAttorney-General last night, of the length of which I am far from\r\ncomplaining, but which was evidently in sharp contradiction with the\r\nview of my honorable and learned friend.\r\n\r\nWhy, sir, it has not been possible to include in this debate a number of\r\nquestions which deserve, and may yet have to receive detailed criticism.\r\nFor example, the law of public meetings has hardly been touched, and yet\r\nit is gravely involved in the proceedings of the recess. (\"_Hear,\r\nhear._\") The relations between landlord and tenant have hardly been\r\ntouched, and to that notwithstanding a similiar observation will apply.\r\n(\"_Hear, hear._\") The treatment given to prisoners of a particular class\r\nhas not been the subject of discussion, and I will make none of these\r\nthree matters subject of discussion; but at the same time no one can\r\ndoubt that all of them, and many more besides, are fit for the attention\r\nof the House. (\"_Hear, hear._\") I must proceed by the method of\r\nselection, and I am bound to say that so far as I am personally\r\nconcerned, if it had not been for the pointed references to me, and the\r\nperfectly fair and just challenges delivered against certain portions of\r\nmy speeches in the recess, I should gladly have remained out of sight. I\r\nam of opinion that such speeches as have been made by the honorable\r\nmember for the city of Cork in moving his amendment, and by the\r\nhonorable member for East Cork on the memorable occasion of the opening\r\nof last night's debate (_Home Rule cheers_), go more to the heart of the\r\nmatter, and more to the mind of the country, than anything that can be\r\nsaid or urged by those who, whatever else may be said of them, cannot\r\ndeny that they stand in the position of leaders of a party, and are\r\nliable to the imputation of party interests. On the other hand, these\r\ngentlemen are in a position to say that they have shown us independence\r\nof party. They have dealt a death blow to Liberal administrations, and\r\nthe members of those Liberal administrations never have complained, and\r\nwould not have been justified in complaining. They are the advocates and\r\nthe organs of a nation. (_Opposition cheers._) They are in a condition\r\nto speak with an effect to which they cannot make any just pretension\r\nwhen they address themselves to the heart and to the understanding of\r\nanother nation on whose judgment they are content to rely. (_\"No,\" from\r\nthe Ministerial benches, and counter cheers._)\r\n\r\nBut, sir, there was a part of the speech of the right honorable\r\ngentlemen which he introduced with an apology, and which I think it\r\nright hriefly to follow. He referred to the communication between Lord\r\nCarnarvon and the member for Cork, and I cannot question for a moment\r\nthe denials he has made. But what were those denials? I attended as well\r\nas I could to his statement, and his denials were three. In the first\r\nplace, he denied that any engagement or agreement had been made. Sir, I\r\nam not aware of its having been asserted. He denied, secondly, that it\r\never had been stated to be the intention of a Conservative Government to\r\ngrant a measure of Home Rule. I am not aware, sir, that that has ever\r\nbeen stated. Thirdly, he denied on the part of Lord Carnarvon, and I\r\naccept the denial with all my heart, that Lord Carnarvon had ever used\r\nany words inconsistent with the maintenance of the Union. (_Ministerial\r\ncheers._) But these three denials leave entirely untouched the material\r\nparts of the case. What are these material parts? If the right honorable\r\ngentleman wishes to dispose of them, I can only say that they are not\r\ndisposed of by what he has said to-night, and he must set about with a\r\nnew set of statements and denials in order to get rid of them.\r\n(_Opposition cheers._) It was stated by the honorable member for the\r\ncity of Cork, that he found himself in substantial--I might say, in\r\nentire agreement with Lord Carnarvon on the question of Home Rule. That\r\nhas not been denied. (_Home Rule cheers._) It has been stated that Lord\r\nCarnarvon spoke for himself, and that I do not question, in so far as a\r\nLord Lieutenant can speak for himself. (_Opposition cheers._) The right\r\nhonorable gentleman, the Chief Secretary, did not deny in the speech he\r\nhas just made, and certainly there was space in that speech for such\r\ndenial, that Lord Carnarvon and the honorable member for Cork were in\r\nsubstantial agreement on the policy of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nMR. BALFOUR. I may say that, from the abstract I read, Lord Carnarvon\r\nclearly, in my idea, did not express his opinion about the Home Rule\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nMR. GLADSTONE. The honorable member for Cork declared that he had an\r\ninterview with Lord Carnarvon, and that he found himself in agreement\r\nwith Lord Carnarvon on the subject. The right honorable gentleman has\r\nnot denied that. (_Home Rule cheers._)\r\n\r\nMR. BALFOUR. I interpreted Lord Carnarvon's statement as distinctly\r\ndenying that.\r\n\r\nMR. GLADSTONE. I ask for the words of Lord Carnarvon's statement which\r\ncontains that denial. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nMR. BALFOUR. I will obtain them as quickly as I can, but it would take\r\nme out of the House to do so now. (_An honorable member: \"Send for\r\nthem.\"_)\r\n\r\nMr. GLADSTONE. It is a very dangerous practice to make statements of\r\nthat kind and importance without the material on which they are founded.\r\n(_Ministerial cries of \"Oh.\"_) I affirm that I am in the recollection of\r\nthe House that whatever inference or interpretation the right honorable\r\ngentleman made upon the declarations of Lord Carnarvon, there was not a\r\nword in the passage he read which contained, or which approached to\r\ncontaining, a denial of the statement of the honorable member for Cork,\r\nthat he and Lord Carnarvon were in substantial agreement on the policy\r\nof Home Rule.\r\n\r\nNow I ask the right honorable gentleman what he thinks of another\r\nstatement made by Lord Carnarvon in the House of Lords, and within the\r\nmemory of all of us, in which, speaking of the measure of entended\r\ngovernment that ought to be granted to Ireland, he said that they ought\r\nto meet all the just demands of that country for local self-government,\r\nand likewise ought to be directed in some degree towards giving\r\nreasonable satisfaction to national aspirations? Does the right\r\nhonorable gentleman say that he is in favor of giving reasonable\r\nsatisfaction to national aspirations? On the contrary, it is the very\r\nphrase and the very idea which, on no consideration, will he recognize,\r\nand it is the phrase and the idea which form the basis of the views of\r\nLord Carnarvon, and here the right honorable gentleman cannot contradict\r\nme. Well, I think, having got so far, I may go farther. Lord Carnarvon,\r\nbeing Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and being a member of the Cabinet, or\r\nwhether he was a member of the Cabinet or not, was absolutely bound to\r\nmake kown his views to Lord Sailsbury, if not to the Cabinet at large.\r\nHe did make known his views to Lord Salisbury in the fulfilment of a\r\nprimary duty. Lord Salisbury continued to repose his confidence in Lord\r\nCarnarvon. For months afterwards Lord Carnarvon continued to be Lord\r\nLieutenant. When he retired he did so professedly on account of his\r\nhealth and amid the expressed regrets of his colleagues. Now, sir, we\r\nare called separatists. (_Ministerial cheers._) We are denounced as\r\nsuch. (_Renewed Ministerial cheers._) I am glad to have any of my\r\nassertions supported by honorable gentlemen opposite, whose approval is\r\nconveyed in that semi-articulate manner which they find so congenial.\r\n(_Opposition cheers and laughter._) But we are called separatists, and\r\nbecause we wish to give effect to the national aspirations of Ireland\r\nwithin the limits of the Constitution and with supreme regard to the\r\nunity of the Empire. (_Ministerial cries of \"Oh,\" and Opposition\r\ncheers._) Lord Salisbury, as the head of a Conservative Government, was\r\ncontent to stand before the country, having in Ireland a Lord Lieutenant\r\nwho was prepared to give satisfaction, reasonable satisfaction, as we\r\nare, to national aspirations, and at the same time to give Ireland\r\neverything in the way of local self-government that ought to be conceded\r\nconsistently with the unity of the Empire. (_Opposition cheers._)\r\n\r\nNow, it appears then that a Tory Lord Lieutenant may dally as he pleases\r\nwith the sirens of Home Rule. It appears that when a general election is\r\npending, the Prime Minister may regard the entertainment of a Home Rule\r\npolicy as no object whatever to placing unbounded confidence in a Tory\r\nLord Lieutenant. But when the election is over (_Home Rule cheers_),\r\nwhen the Lord Lieutenant is gone, and when Liberals declare that they\r\ndesire to meet the national aspirations of Ireland with a reasonable and\r\nsafe satisfaction, then, forsooth, they are to be denounced as\r\nseparatists. (_Opposition cheers._) I must say a word upon the\r\nentertaining speech of the honorable and gallant member for North\r\nArmagh. I was struck, I confess, when, after all his assaults upon us,\r\nthe honorable gentleman gravely concluded with an argument in favor of\r\nlaw and order, but with an insinuation that his countrymen would not be\r\nvery much disposed to adopt that doctrine. Well, I don't agree with him\r\nabout his countrymen, but if we were engaged in an endeavor to show that\r\nIrishmen were not sufficiently good to recognize the principles of law\r\nand order, undoubtedly the instance to which I should refer would be the\r\nhonorable gentleman himself. The honorable and gallant gentleman is\r\nhere, forsooth, to instruct and to educate us on the subject of law and\r\norder, while he reserves to himself the right of declaring, and more\r\nthan once declaring, in this House, as far as I remember--(_Col.\r\nSaunderson: \"Yes.\"_) So much the better. All right. (_Laughter and\r\ncheers._) He declared that \"if Parliament passed ant act for granting\r\nto Ireland a carefully guarded portion of the independence she once\r\npossessed, he will be the man to resist and to recommend resistance.\"\r\n(_Opposition cheers._) He is dealing with gentlemen below the gangway,\r\nand he has the consummate art and the consummate courage to advertise\r\nhimself as the apostle of law and order. (_Cheers._) Then the honorable\r\nmember referred to a speech of mine in which I referred to the\r\nlamentable murder of Constable Whelehan in the county of Clare. The\r\nChief Secretary was not ashamed in this House, where he could not be\r\nanswered, to say that I had made adverse comments on the conduct of\r\nWhelehan, a man who had lost his life in the service of his country.\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR. I said it in this House on Friday last, and I say it again.\r\n(_Ministerial cheers._)\r\n\r\nMr. GLADSTONE. I have no intention of charging the right honorable\r\ngentleman with anything which is not true in fact. I am glad he has\r\ncontradicted me. I did not recollect, for I did not hear it. But it was\r\ntotally and absolutely untrue. (_Opposition cheers._) Either he had not\r\nread what I said, or if he has read it, and the same applies to the\r\nhonorable and gallant member for North Armagh, they have absolutely\r\nmisrepresented the purport of the speech they professed to quote. I\r\nnever named Whelehan except to deplore his death, and to express the\r\nhope that his murderers would be punished. In my reference to that\r\nspeech, there is not a word to show that Whelehan was the man who was\r\nthe unhappy organ of the police in ministering pecuniary payment to the\r\ninfamous informer, nor is there one word in all that reference of blame\r\nto her Majesty's Government. On the contrary, there is an express\r\ndeclaration that I laid no blame upon her Majesty's Government with\r\nreference to the case of Whelehan. Why, then, did I refer to it? On this\r\naccount: The honorable and gallant gentleman, in the careless way in\r\nwhich he refers to these things, said I must be cognizant of the fact\r\nthat prices were paid for obtaining information I said at Nottingham; I\r\nmade no reference at all to the rather difficult question of payment of\r\nprices for obtaining information: but what I referred to was the payment\r\nof prices, not for obtaining information, but for concocting and\r\nconcerting crimes. (_Cheers._) After the gradual revelations that were\r\nmade to us of the mode in which Ireland is administered, according to\r\nthe traditions of that country, it is perfectly possible that such\r\nthings may have been done, though I have never heard of them. But when I\r\ndid learn in that particular instance of that foul and loathsome\r\npractice of paying money for such a purpose to a man, as far as we are\r\nyet informed, who was to attend a meeting of the criminals for the\r\npurpose of putting a hand to the arrangement and the execution of it\r\n(_loud cheers_), then I did think it was time to protest in the name of\r\nthe Liberal party, if not of the whole country, against the practice\r\nwhich, in my opinion, is in itself odious to the last degree, which\r\nwould not be for a moment tolerated in England, and in reference to\r\nwhich I thought it wise and right to point out that it was dangerous as\r\nwell as odious, that when in a similar case the population of England\r\nhad become cognizant of similar practices, they themselves had resorted\r\nto the commission of crime for the purpose of marking the detestation\r\nwith which they regarded it. (\"_Hear, hear._\")\r\n\r\nI pass on to the remarks of the right honorable gentleman the Chief\r\nSecretary for Ireland, and I feel bound to refer to the observation he\r\nmade during the general debate on the address last week, to what he\r\ncalled the practice of members on this side of the House of making\r\nstatements outside this House which they would not repeat within it, and\r\nespecially to his adverse and rather angry comments on tne pacific tone\r\nof the speech which I had just delivered. The right honorable gentleman\r\noverflows with pugnacious matter. He is young and inexperienced in\r\ndebate, and bold and able as I confess him to be, I think that when he\r\nhas been fifty-six years in the service of his country, it is possible\r\nthat his stock of contentious eagerness may be a little abated.\r\n(_Laughter and cheers._) I have many reasons, but if I must give a\r\nreason why I was particularly anxious to avoid the needless introduction\r\nof contentious or polemical or accusatory matter in speaking on the\r\nopening debate on the address. I felt that an Irish debate was pending;\r\nand in the second place, the great object I had in view was to assist\r\nand to promote the purpose of the Government,--to promote, I will also\r\nsay, the honor, dignity, and efficiency of this House, by giving what I\r\nmay call in homely language a good start to the business of the session,\r\nby detaching it from everything like controversy. But if the right\r\nhonorable gentleman laments the uncombative character of that\r\ndiscussion, I think he will derive probably ample satisfaction in the\r\nfuture. There is no fear, I believe, that Irish debate will be wanting\r\nin animation, possibly in animosity, so long as the right honorable\r\ngentleman continues to be Chief Secretary. (_Opposition cheers and\r\nlaughter._) The right honorable gentleman even on that occasion found in\r\nmy pacific speech matter deserving of indignant rebuke. I repeat my\r\nlamentations that some of the most difficult and the nicest parts of the\r\nlaw are removed by the operation of the Coercion Act of last year from\r\njudges and juries to men whom I termed of an inferior stamp. That was\r\nthe observation I ventured to make, and the right honorable gentleman\r\nwas rather wrathful over it. I fully admit that he is a perfect master\r\nof _tu quoque_. He said, \"Whoever they are, they are the men whom Lord\r\nSpencer appointed.\" In the first place, that is quite inaccurate; and in\r\nthe second place, if inaccurate, it was totally irrelevant. It is\r\nperfectly inaccurate.\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR. I said that sixty out of seventy-three were appointed\r\nmostly by Lord Spencer, or else were the appointments of previous\r\nGovernments revived by him.\r\n\r\nMr. GLADSTONE. And so the right honorable gentleman thinks that what he\r\ncalls reviving--that is to say not dismissing--is the same thing as\r\nappointing. (_\"Hear, hear,\" and laughter._)\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen of whose conduct as resident magistrates I especially\r\ncomplained, were Mr. Eldon, Captain Seagrave, Mr. Cecil Roche, Mr.\r\nMeldon, and Mr. Carew. These five, and undoubtedly these are the\r\ngentlemen I had specially in view when I spoke of men of an inferior\r\nstamp, not one of these was appointed by Lord Spencer. (_Cheers._) But\r\nsupposing they were, the statement of the right honorable gentleman was\r\nabsolutely and ludicrously irrelevant. What I was speaking of was not\r\nthe discharge by the resident magistrates of their ordinary and\r\ntraditionary duties, but the extraordinary duties which the right\r\nhonorable gentleman and the Government have insisted in putting upon\r\nthem. The right honorable gentleman was especially indignant with me,\r\nbecause at a given date in the recess, or before the termination of the\r\nsession, I telegraphed to some correspondent the words, \"Remember\r\nMitchelstown,\" and that in a speech at Nottingham I had developed my\r\nmeaning of that phrase with all the force I could. The right honorable\r\ngentleman thought fit to point at me the reproach that I was not\r\ndisposed to maintain here what I have said elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNow I have referred to my own statement at Nottingham about\r\nMitchelstown, and I can only say I not only adhere to it, but I\r\nstrengthen it. I never in my life uttered words, or sent words by letter\r\nor telegram, which I more rejoice to have used, and am better content to\r\nhave used, than the words, \"Remember Mitchelstown.\" (_Loud Opposition\r\ncheers._) It was not done inconsiderately. It was done considerately,\r\nfor the sake of Ireland and the country, and for the sake of preventing\r\nthe enormous mischiefs, probable sufferings, probable bloodshed, and the\r\nconsequent resistance to the law that might arise in Ireland in\r\nconsequence of what had occurred at Mitchelstown, and of its adoption\r\nand appropriation by the right honorable gentleman. (_Cheers._) What was\r\nit? It was this: A legal meeting (\"_Hear, hear_\") of 4,000 men\r\nassembled; the police, under the plea of the common practice of having\r\nan official reporter at the meeting, instead of prior communication with\r\nthose who held it, instead of going to the platform at a point where it\r\nwas open and accessible, formed a wedge of twenty men, and endeavored by\r\nforce to drive that wedge into the middle of the crowd. I am here to say\r\nthat a public meeting is an orderly assembly; that to observe order in a\r\npublic meeting is part of the law of the land (\"_Hear, hear_\"); that the\r\ndriving a wedge into the meeting was an illegality on the part of the\r\npolice; and that the police who drove it into the crowd were themselves\r\nguilty of illegality, and ought to have been given into custody.\r\n(_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nOn this deplorable occasion the agents of the law were the breakers of\r\nthe law, and those breakers of the law, acting in the first instance\r\nunder subordinate authority, were adopted and sanctioned by the right\r\nhonorable gentleman, with the full authority of the Government.\r\n(_Cheers._) What was the second act of the police? Their wedge was not\r\nstrong enough; they were pressed back out of the crowd, and it seems to\r\nme with perfect propriety and legality, whereupon they brought a large\r\nforce of police and charged the crowd, because the crowd had not\r\nconcurred and co-operated in the former illegality. That was a fresh\r\nillegality committed by the police. Then violence began; then began the\r\nuse of batons; then began the use of sticks and cudgels; then began the\r\nsufferings of the men in the crowd, and of individual members of the\r\npolice, on which the right honorable gentleman is eloquent, and which I\r\nregret as much as he does. But the police in these two illegalities of\r\nattacking and batoning the crowd were defeated. The crowd did not pursue\r\nthem. (_Cheers._) According to all the information before us, the crowd\r\nwere recalled, and again took their places in the square. A mere\r\nscattering and sprinkling of most probably boys, we know not how and to\r\nwhat extent, were in the street where the police barracks are to be\r\nfound; and among them, those boys or others, succeeded in breaking three\r\nwindows of the police barracks. (_Laughter._) Those three windows were\r\nexalted and uplifted by the right honorable gentleman into a general\r\nattack on the barracks, compelling the police, in self-defence, to fire\r\non the people. In one sense I must say the police did not fire on the\r\npeople, for no mass of people was there to fire on. I said at\r\nNottingham, and it is the result of all the inquiry I have made, that\r\nthere was not more than twenty people in the street opposite the\r\nbarracks, and under these circumstances the police actually fired into\r\nthe windows of the opposite house, where there were peaceful people,\r\nwomen, and children; and they fired deliberately at individuals, two old\r\nmen and one boy, whom they destroyed. That I do not hesitate here to\r\ndenounce--I think I did not use the words at Nottingham--as cruel,\r\nwanton, and disgraceful bloodshed (_Loud cheers._) It recalls the period\r\nof Lord Sidmouth, and was bloodshed which, so far as I know, has had no\r\nexample in its wantonness and causelessness since the memorable occasion\r\nin Manchester, which is popularly known as the Massacre of Peterloo.\r\n(_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nNow, I have given the right honorable gentlemen my views about\r\nMitchelstown. (_Opposition cheers and derisive Ministerial cheers._) It\r\nwas time that I should say, \"Remember Mitchelstown.\" Mitchelstown might\r\nhave become what in one particular class of language is termed a\r\n\"prerogative instance.\" The Mitchelstown police, commended by the right\r\nhonorable gentleman, were held up to the police in Ireland as the\r\npattern which they were to follow. (_Cheers._) They were told they had\r\nacted only in self-defence, and the measure and meaning of self-defence,\r\nas exhibited at Mitchelstown, I feared, and it was reasonable to fear,\r\nwould be the meaning and the measure of self-defence on every other\r\noccasion, when, by legality or illegality, the police found an\r\nopportunity of coming into collision with the people. (_Cheers._) I tell\r\nthe right honorable gentleman frankly that, in my opinion, he had\r\nbecome, by clear implication, a breaker of the law. (_Cheers._) He had\r\ngiven to the breaking of the law authoritative countenance and approval,\r\nand not only so, but he had done it under circumstances where that\r\nauthoritative approval, conveyed to the mind of the police, would\r\nnaturally, justly, and excusably, almost necessarily, have pointed out\r\nto them that that was to be the model and rule of their conduct in every\r\nexample of the kind. (_Cheers._) Sir, it was in the interests of law and\r\norder that I denounced the conduct of the police. (_Opposition cheers\r\nand derisive Ministerial cheers, in which Mr. Balfour joined._) It will\r\nbe a long time, I think, before he can discover an instance, either on\r\nthis bench or among any of those who are our friends, in which the law\r\nand order of the country, and the security and the lives of the people,\r\nhad been treated with such recklessness as they then were by the right\r\nhonorable gentleman and his colleagues. (_Cheers._) I have done my best\r\nto inform myself, and in conformity with, I believe, uncontradicted and\r\nconsentient statements, I contend that the inferences I have drawn from\r\nthese facts are just inferences, and that it was not only natural but\r\nnecessary to adopt precautions on the part, I will say, of England,\r\nagainst the fatal imitations which Mitchelstown might have produced, and\r\nto take securities for law and order in Ireland, first of all, as I\r\npointed out to the people of England, that these things ought to be\r\nwatched; and secondly, by making known to the Government, and to their\r\nagents and their organs beyond the the Channel, that if such occurrences\r\ndid happen, they would not pass uncensured. (_Cheers._) I believe I\r\nnever spoke more useful--I will go further, and say more fruitful--words\r\nthan when I telegraphed, \"Remember Mitchelstown.\" (_Loud Opposition\r\ncheers and derisive Ministerial cheers._) I now come to the statistics\r\nof the right honorable gentleman, with reference to boycotting. The\r\nGovernment are particularly stingy in their statistics, but they have\r\ngiven some figures as to boycotting. I do not recollect that boycotting\r\nwas ever made a portion of Government statistics before.\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR. We have made statistics before on boycotting.\r\n\r\nMr. GLADSTONE. Yes; but I am speaking of the ancient and traditional\r\npractice which this Conservative Government are always so indisposed to\r\nfollow. (_Opposition cheers and laughter._) Statistics of crime deal\r\nwith facts and matter of record; statistics of boycotting, as far as I\r\nunderstand, are matter of opinion. (\"_Hear, hear._\") What amounts to\r\nboycotting,--what is the test of it? There must be, and will be, cases\r\nof harsh and unreasonable persecution under the name of boycotting. It\r\nis never to be forgotten, though it is very common to forget it, that\r\nwhen you have a state of things that prevails in Ireland,--old and sore\r\nrelations of friction between class and class, the sense of still\r\nremaining suffering or grievance, and consequent instability of social\r\norder,--the criminal elements that will always subsist in every\r\ncommunity (though I thank God to say that I believe they subsist in\r\nIreland more narrowly than almost anywhere else), I will find their way\r\ninto social questions, and undoubtedly you will have bad, and very bad,\r\ncases exhibited in matters such as these. Therefore the exhibition of\r\nparticular instances is a very unsafe and insufficient test. They ought\r\nto be quoted with great accuracy. The right honorable gentleman has been\r\ndefending to-night his chosen instruments of the present year. (\"_Hear,\r\nhear._\") Yes, but he was met immediately with point blank contradictions\r\non matters of fact, and at present I shall enter no further into that\r\nquestion, which evidently must be made the subject of further\r\nexamination. (\"_Hear, hear._\") But the right honorable gentleman gave us\r\nlast year a case of boycotting which was touching to the last\r\ndegree,--the case of the Galway midwife. (_Cheers and laughter._) Does\r\nthe right honorable gentleman say that the instance he selected last\r\nyear--the instance of the Galway midwife--was well founded? (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR. Absolutely correct in every particular. (_Ministerial\r\ncheers._)\r\n\r\nMr. GLADSTONE. All I can say is, that here likewise the right honorable\r\ngentleman has been met with a point blank contradiction. (\"_Hear,\r\nhear._\") But what are we to say of boycotting statistics as a basis for\r\nlegislation or for congratulation on the rising felicity of a country,\r\nwhen the right honorable gentleman, out of the thousands of cases he has\r\nhad before him, can only select for us two upon which he is at once met\r\nby having his facts challenged, and his conclusions falsified?\r\n(_Cheers._) Let me point out this. My right honorable friend, the member\r\nfor Newcastle, well remarked on a former occasion, that there is a\r\nchapter of statistics which, if the right honorable gentleman had chosen\r\nto enter it, would have been far more to the purpose on this occsion\r\nthan these he has laid before us, though they are not wholly without\r\nvalue; and that is the statistics of evicted or derelict land. (\"_Hear,\r\nhear._\") There could be no difficulty whatever for the right honorable\r\ngentleman to have called for returns of the acreage on farms, which, in\r\ndifferent counties in Ireland, either all over Ireland or in selected\r\ncounties, had been derelict a year, two years, or three years ago, in\r\nthe time of Lord Spencer and down to the present date, and had shown us\r\nhow, under the recovered liberty of the Irish people, about which he\r\nboasts, the acreage of these derelict farms had gradually been\r\ndiminished. The right honorable gentleman has not only avoided but\r\nshirked that question (_cheers_), and he shirked it because he\r\nsubstituted for any attempt at a rational answer to my right honorable\r\nfriend, a jeremiad upon the state of feeling which he thought might be\r\nproduced in Ireland when he found my right honorable friend using\r\nlanguage which, in his opinion, was capable of being interpreted into\r\nsympathy with the operations of the Land League. (\"_Hear, hear._\") A\r\nmore unjust charge never was made. (_Opposition cheers_). But, just or\r\nunjust, it has nothing to do with the question.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman found himself, and the Queen has been\r\ninstructed to found herself in her speech, and the organs of the\r\nGovernment have based themselves in their articles, upon the assertion\r\nthat liberty, as they phrase it, is returning to the people of Ireland.\r\nIf that liberty were returning, it would be exhibited in a proportionate\r\ndiminution of derelect farms. (_\"Hear, hear,\" from Mr. Balfour._) Then\r\nwhy have you not shown it? (_Opposition cheers._) There is one part of\r\nthe statistics that we have read with increased satisfacfaction, that is\r\nthe diminution in the amount of crime, limited as that diminution is. I\r\nthought when the right honorable gentleman constructed his artificial\r\nreturn, he had some very special purpose in view. It is the first time\r\nthat I have known the month of January do such good service, and when I\r\nlook into the return, I find out the cause: The return of offences\r\nreported to the constabulary are reported under three major\r\nheads,--offences against the person, offences against property, and\r\noffences against the public peace. With regard to the offences against\r\nthe person and property, I find that if I take the five months only of\r\nlast year, after the passing of the Coercion Act, and compare them with\r\nthe corresponding five months of the year before, there is no diminution\r\nwhatever. (\"_Hear, hear._\") But in the month of January there was in\r\noffences against the person a sudden, a most well-timed, and fortunate,\r\nand rapid decline, for they fell from ten to three. The right honorable\r\ngentleman drew January into his service; by means of that declension, he\r\nwas able to show a diminution of six per cent of offences against person\r\nand property. I am extremely glad of it, and wish there had been a great\r\ndeal more. The offences which have sensibly and really diminished are\r\nthose against the public peace, and I rejoice that they have diminished.\r\nBut why? The right honorable gentleman stands up and says that the cause\r\nof the diminution is the Coercion Act, but I think I have shown that\r\nwhereas the diminution of crime proper, as directed against person and\r\nproperty, is an exceedingly small diminution, the diminution of offences\r\nagainst the public peace is much larger. I make it out to be that that\r\nthey fell in these six months from three hundred and twenty-four to two\r\nhundred and thirty-eight, or a diminution of about twenty-five per cent.\r\nThese are exactly the offences that would diminish under the operation\r\nof a conciliatory Land Act. (_Opposition cheers._)\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman has the boldness to say that we, on this\r\nside of the House, never gave any credit to the Land Act. Why, sir, the\r\nLand Act, grossly imperfect as it was, culpably imperfect in the matter\r\nof arrears (_cheers_), contained a great and important provision which\r\nthe member for Cork in vain had demanded in the September before, which,\r\nif it had then been granted, you probably never might have heard of the\r\nPlan of Campaign. (_Cheers._) It was denounced to the House by the\r\nGovernment of that day as being a provision totally incompatible with\r\nthat morality, forsooth, on which right honorable gentlemen prided\r\nthemselves. (_Laughter._) I speak of the provision which, under a great\r\nresponsibility, her Majesty's Government, though far too late,\r\nintroduced as a most valuable gift. It was quite evident that, so far as\r\noffences against the public peace were concerned, the reopening of the\r\njudicial rents, and the concession made to leaseholders, could not but\r\noperate in the most powerful manner in favor of that diminution.\r\n(_Cheers._) There are two other questions to be considered, viz., how\r\nthe law has been administered, and how the administration of the law has\r\nsucceeded. Has the administration of the law been of a character to\r\nreconcile, or has it been of a character to estrange, or has it been\r\ncalculated to teach respect for the Government, or to bring the\r\nGovernment into increasing hatred or contempt? I am not going into\r\ndetails of prison treatment, but I am going to touch the case of two\r\nmembers of Parliament, with reference to a matter other than prison\r\ntreatment. I am not cognizant by direct and personal knowledge of the\r\nfacts, but I have received them from quarters thought to be thoroughly\r\ninformed. Unless I had so received them, I would not think of laying\r\nthem before the House.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheehy, a member of this House, has been arrested and remanded\r\nwithout bail. It was a misfortune which might have been taken into\r\nconsideration at the time that his wife was ill of a disease known as\r\nscarlatina, or scarlet fever. He was offered bail by the Government if\r\nhe would promise not to open his lips in public. By Government--that, I\r\npresume, means the Executive Government. I want to know what title the\r\nresident magistrate had to make such a condition as that. (_Opposition\r\ncheers._) Most dangerous is this introduction of the new discretion of\r\nresident magistrates,--a discretion of imposing new restrictions upon\r\nprisoners. Why is it necessary to impose these conditions? If Mr.\r\nSheehy chose to commit an offence while he was under bail, he could be\r\ntaken up for that, and I want to hear from the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, or some member of the Government, a distinct account of the\r\nnew doctrine that those conditions may be imposed, which are written, I\r\nbelieve, neither in law nor in custom, which have been set in action in\r\nIreland, but which in England, we know, are not heard of, and would not\r\nbe heard of or tolerated for a moment. (_Cheers._) Mr. Sheehy, I must\r\nsay, very properly entirely declined to accede to that condition, and he\r\nwas tried and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. He appealed, as\r\nhe was entitled to do, and bail was accepted for his appearance at\r\nquarter sessions, so that he would have been able to obey the almost\r\nsacred domestic form of tie which was at the time incumbent upon him.\r\nBut as he was going out of the door of the court he was arrested again\r\non another charge, and brought away immediately to a distant part of the\r\ncountry, his wife being in the very crisis of her illness, and her life\r\nseriously threatened. On the second charge he was sentenced, not to\r\nthree months, which would have enabled him to appeal, but to one months\r\nimprisonment, (_Nationalist cheers_), depriving him of the power of\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nMr. CHANCE. Which had been promised by the right honorable gentleman to\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nMr. GLADSTONE. The right honorable gentleman, the Chief Secretary, is\r\nperfectly aware of that promise. He is perfectly aware that in the\r\ndebate last year he was charged by my right honorable friend near me\r\n(Sir W. Harcourt) with breech of faith with regard to that promise, and\r\nto that charge of breach he has remained, I must say, very patiently\r\nsilent. (_Opposition cheers._) Now, is that the sort of administration\r\nof the act of last year which her Majesty's Government are prepared to\r\ndefend? (_Opposition cheers._) Is it thus that Ireland is to be\r\nreconciled? (_Nationalist cheers._) Is it thus that the Irish nation is\r\nto be converted? Is it in this House of Commons, the most ancient and\r\nthe noblest of all the temples of freedom, that such operations as this\r\nare to be either passed over in silence or defended by those engaged in\r\nthem? (_Loud Opposition cheers._) I cannot understand the extreme\r\nseverity of treatment in certain particulars, if I am rightly informed,\r\nmeted out to this gentleman; but I wish to keep for the present to what\r\nrelates most distinctly to the administration of the law as apart from\r\nprison discipline, and in that view alone I would mention the case of\r\nAlderman Hooper and others. Alderman Hooper was sentenced for publishing\r\nreports of the National League branches that had been suppressed,\r\nalthough, as I understand, there are plenty of these reports published\r\nwithin the cognizance of the Government, with respect to which those who\r\npublish them have not been sentenced and have not been proceeded\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nWell, Mr. Alderman Hooper was proceeded against, and was sentenced for\r\npublishing these reports for a term of one month. He would have had\r\nthere no right of appeal, but was again simultaneously charged for\r\npublishing another report; another sentence of one month was pronounced\r\nupon him. These sentences, though cumulative with regard to him, were\r\nnot cumulative with regard to the right to appeal. (_Cheers._)\r\nTherefore, while the right honorable gentleman professed to give the\r\nright of appeal for all sentences above a month, by this clever device\r\nhe has contrived to inflict upon Alderman Hooper, a member of this\r\nHouse, an imprisonment of two months, and yet that Alderman Hooper\r\nshould have no right of appeal. And there again, sir, I say I am sorry\r\nto use strong words, but I am tempted to do so outside this House, and I\r\nwill do so in this House. (_Opposition cheers_) This was explained to be\r\nnot only a constitutional violence, not only a clear evasion of the\r\nspirit of the law, but an incredible meanness (_loud Opposition\r\ncheers_), a meanness in the method of administering the Crimes Act, and\r\na spirit is displayed which, if the Irish people had only a hundredth\r\npart of the courage, the pluck, and perseverance which they had shown\r\nthrough seven centuries, could only tend to alienate and estrange them\r\nfrom those who attempt so to govern them. (_Opposition cheers._) The\r\nword that I have thus used I am going to use again. (_Ministerial\r\nlaughter._) I am very desirous to invite the concurrence of the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer in the propriety of my application of it, or\r\nwhether he considers that nobleness would be a better description of the\r\ncircumstances which I am about to describe. Without knowing what I am\r\ngoing to say, the right honorable gentleman accepts my challenge, and,\r\ntherefore, I am justified in exhibiting a specimen of the nobleness with\r\nwhich this administration of Ireland is conceived and executed.\r\n\r\nI have before me a list of six people prosecuted, not for publishing\r\nreports of suppressed branches, but for selling them. Their names are:\r\nMacnamara, at Tralee; Mahony, Tralee; Molloy, Tralee; Brosman,\r\nKillarney; Green, at Killarney, also; and at Ennis, another Macnamara.\r\n(_Irish honorable members: \"This same man twice.\"_) Two of the cases\r\nwere dismissed, but four of them were sent to prison,--one for a month\r\nwith hard labor, another for a month with hard labor, another for two\r\nmonths with hard labor, and another released on a promise not to do it\r\nagain. Again this method of interfering with private freedom by\r\narbitrary restriction, governed by no law, justified by no usage,\r\ndevised by this spirit of Irish administration (_cheers_), and with\r\nrespect to which I want to know how far this importation into the law\r\nand jurisprudence of the country is to be carried under the auspices of\r\nher Majesty's Government. Well, now, sir, I want to know from the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, if he is to speak to-night, does he see\r\nnobleness in the prosecution of these men? (\"_Hear, hear._\") Does he\r\nthink it rational to prosecute these men? (_Cheers._) Does he think it\r\nright to require of the vender of a newspaper that he should read its\r\ncontents? Does he think it right to require that he should have formed\r\nhis judgment of those contents, that he should have made up his mind\r\nwhether the proceedings described in the newspaper were legal or\r\nillegal? and is that the responsibility which he thinks ought to be\r\nimposed on the vender of a newspaper under pain of being condemned to\r\none month or two months' imprisonment? This administration of the Crimes\r\nAct, to which I must advisedly apply, until I am better instructed, the\r\nterm \"meanness,\" has yet, at any rate, had no defence offered in the\r\ncourse of this debate. (_Cheers._) The remaining point of the\r\nadministration of the law on which I will comment is of a different\r\ncharacter. It is with respect to exclusive dealing.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that we, in our charges against the bill last\r\nyear, did not say that it justified the proceedings of exclusive\r\ndealing. I do not believe the act does justify them; but this I am bound\r\nto say, that the interpretation of the act appears to be deliberately\r\napplied in a variety of instances for the punishment of simple exclusive\r\ndealing. The right honorable gentleman ought to know, if he does not,\r\nfor I delivered the speech in his hearing, that when I spoke of the\r\ndismissal of curates by rectors and the deprivation of their daily\r\nbread, that men with wives and children were to be turned out upon the\r\nworld, I was not, as the right honorable gentlemen charged me, comparing\r\nthem with cases of conspiracy, but I was comparing them with cases of\r\nexclusive dealing, which, while they are practised freely both in\r\nIreland by the opponents of the Nationalists, and in England by the\r\nparty of the right honorable gentleman (_Opposition cheers_), unpunished\r\nby the law, I believe it is stretching and straining even the deplorable\r\nand shameful act of last session to make it include such cases. Now,\r\nsir, I wish to mention eight cases, but first I find I was quite wrong\r\nin saying that two of the cases for selling newspapers had been\r\ndismissed. They were not. The defendants were released upon promise, and\r\nthe other four punished. I have now before me eight cases of exclusive\r\ndealing, two of which were dismissed, but in all of which the Government\r\nproceeded. In one of these cases a man was punished with a month's hard\r\nlabor for refusing to shoe a horse for a boycotted person; another, for\r\nrefusing to sell groceries to a boycotted person; a third, for refusing\r\nto shoe a horse; and a fourth, for declining to deal with emergency men.\r\nThose are all cases of exclusive dealing. They are not cases of\r\nconspiracy. In fact, these men have been punished for doing in Ireland\r\nthat which would be perfectly lawful in England, and which, I believe,\r\nis perfectly lawful even in Ireland, under any fair interpretation of\r\nthe act. Now, has the act succeeded, or it has failed? I do not think\r\ngentlemen will object to the proposition that its real object was to put\r\ndown the National League and the Plan of Campaign.\r\n\r\nNow I come again to the speech of the honorable member for East Cork\r\n(Mr. W. O'Brien) which, I venture to say, was a memorable speech.\r\n(_Cheers_). To him, as I have never had the privilege of private or\r\npersonal communication, I will say publicly in this House that though,\r\nas he says, imprisonment under the condition he describes is a hard and\r\nsevere thing, which drives the iron into the soul of a man and leaves\r\nhim such that he hardly can be again what he was before, yet I trust\r\nthat the right honorable gentleman has derived some consolation and\r\nencouragement to persevere, at least, in lawful and patriotic efforts\r\nfor setting right the wrongs of his country. I hope he has derived it\r\nfrom the enthusiastic reception that he encountered in this House and\r\nout of it, and, I will add, for the credit of honorable gentlemen\r\nopposite, from the respectful, and, to some extent, I think, the\r\nsymathetic silence with which they also accorded him a kindly reception.\r\n(_Cheers._) The speech of the honorable member was of an importance\r\nwhich has not in the smallest degree been appreciated by the Chief\r\nSecretary. The right honorable gentleman has argued the case in his old\r\nmanner; and whereas the honorable gentleman charged him with having said\r\nthat he pleaded ill-health against the prison dress, what appears is\r\nthat the Chief Secretary says that the honorable member had sheltered\r\nhimself by ill-health against the demand to wear prison dress. For that\r\nstatement of the right honorable gentleman, as amended and admitted,\r\nthere is not a shadow of foundation. (_Irish cheers._) That you cannot\r\ncontradict, although you have plenty of myrmidons, and, perhaps, some\r\nminions. You cannot show that either by word or act, the honorable\r\nmember entered this ignominious plea. Why has the right honorable\r\ngentleman passed by in silence another personal statement of the\r\nhonorable member, which I tell him he had no right to pass by, and with\r\nrespect to which I will now put it to him and the House, that after he\r\nhas had an opportunity of making Lord Salisbury's defence, he has\r\nutterly failed to tender any defence at all? (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nMr. BALFOUR. He did not require any.\r\n\r\nMr. GLADSTONE. That is just the matter I am going to argue, and we will\r\nsee how it stands. The statement of the member for Cork was to this\r\neffect, that Lord Salisbury in one of his speeches, after some jocose\r\nreferences which exhibit the tase of the Prime Minister (_Opposition\r\ncheers_), and which are a great deal too common in speeches proceeding\r\nfrom such quarters, held up to British indignation the illegality of the\r\nconduct of the member for East Cork, and stated that it had led to\r\ndisturbances, to attacks upon persons which even placed life in danger,\r\nand to gross outrages. In reply, the honorable gentleman stated that his\r\nintervention at Mitchelstown produced no act of violence whatever, but\r\non the contrary averted it. The Chief Secretary has not been able to\r\ncontrovert that statement. (_Cheers._) Not being able to controvert it,\r\nhe has passed it by. He has neither the courage to prosecute, nor the\r\ngenerosity to withdraw. (_Cheers._) Lord Salisbury made an allegation of\r\na gross and grievous character, which his nephew in this House cannot\r\nsay a word in support of.\r\n\r\nNow, however, he says that that allegation of Lord Salisbury, injurious\r\nas it is, and remaining without a shadow of defence, needs no apology.\r\n(_Cheers._) I hold that until Lord Salisbury can show that he was\r\njustified in the broad and most important statement that he made, a\r\npersonal apology from him is due to the member for East Cork.\r\n(_Opposition cheers._) This is a personal matter, but it is no slight\r\nthing that charges of this kind should be made by the Prime Minister,\r\nand that then, forsooth, we should have a shuffling and a shrinking from\r\nany attempt to deal with them. With regard to the act for which the\r\nmember for East Cork was put in prison, the honorable gentleman, has\r\npointed out the attendant circumstances and the consequences of his act;\r\nbut the right honorable gentleman instead of admitting the virtue of\r\nthose pleas, generalized his charge, and said it was the habitual and\r\nsettled practice of the Irish members to do these things. Why, then, did\r\nthey select for prosecution this instance, in which the member for Cork\r\nis able to state, without contradiction, that his intervention, whatever\r\njudgment may be given on the naked question of its legality, not only\r\nsaved tenants from distress, but the public peace from disorder and\r\noutrage? (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nNow I wish to call attention to the most important part of the statement\r\nthat I am presuming to make. When I heard the address read from the\r\nchair, I said that the heart of it was the challenging paragraph; and\r\nwhen I heard the speech of the member for East Cork last night, I said\r\nto myself, \"Never did I hear so challenging a speech.\" The assertions of\r\nthe member for East Cork opened up the whole question, and gave to the\r\nGovernment the opportunity by contradiction, by grappling with those\r\nassertions, of establishing their case and of showing that their designs\r\nagainst the National League and the Plan of Campaign were, at least, in\r\nprocess of accomplisment. Here I must say a word about the Plan of\r\nCampaign. It is an interference with the law. It has, no doubt,\r\nsubstituted its authority for the law. Far be it from me to assert that\r\nnecessarily such a plan in the abstract is an evil. But it is something\r\nmore. It is a sign that the law does not do its work. It is a sign that\r\nthe conditions of legality do not exist. It is a warning to set about\r\nrestoring them. This is not the only place where extra legal\r\ncombinations and anti-legal combinations have been brought into\r\nexistence for the purpose of mitigating social disorder. Having cited\r\nseveral of such organizations, such as the Swing organization, the\r\nCamorra society in Italy, and Lynch law in America, the right honorable\r\ngentleman said, these, all of them, are in their nature evils, but such\r\nis the imperfection of man and the imperfection of his institutions,\r\nthat sometimes things that are evils in themselves are the cure of\r\ngreater evils, and in respect of the Plan of Campaign, what has to be\r\nshown, is that without it Ireland would have been happier and more\r\ntranquil than it is at present.\r\n\r\nHaving recapitulated Mr. O'Brien's six statements as to the beneficial\r\neffects of the plan, Mr. Gladstone continued: Now, whereas we now appear\r\nto know that there are about forty cases settled under the Plan of\r\nCampaign, there is no case in which payments made under the plan have\r\nbeen censured as rapacious or unreasonable by a single Land Commission.\r\nNow, be it recollected that I am not arguing upon the propriety of the\r\nplan. I am arguing upon its success. I have shown that there is not the\r\nsmallest shred of contradiction against any one of those allegations,\r\nand that, taken as they stand, they show that at this moment,\r\nnotwithstanding the boasts of the administration, the Plan of Campaign\r\nstands in Ireland entire, successful, and triumphant. Since it has been\r\nunder the proscription of the right honorable gentleman for a certain\r\ntime, it appears, according to the facts before us, to weigh\r\nconsiderably heavier than it did before he had anything to do with it,\r\nand well this illustrates the success of the right honorable gentleman's\r\npolicy. (_Home Rule cheers._)\r\n\r\nThere is one still more important point. The right honorable gentleman\r\nmade no attempt to connect the National League or the Plan of Campaign\r\nwith the commission of crime and outrage. The Attorney-General did make\r\nan attempt, and what was the narrow basis of that attempt? Why, it was\r\none upon which a tight-rope dancer might perhaps have found a footing,\r\nbut from which men with only ordinary means of locomotion must have\r\nfallen. (_Laughter._) He got hold of two crimes,--one of the Plan of\r\nCampaign, and one of the National League, and how did he establish the\r\nconnection? Intuitively, out of his inner consciousness, for as he could\r\nnot see the causes of the crimes, he thought it reasonable to put them\r\ndown to these institutions, and, to prevent jealousy, he gave one crime\r\nto each. (_Laughter._) What course was open to the honorable and learned\r\ngentleman? What course remains open to the Government if they intend, as\r\nthey ought deliberately and seriously, to show a connection between\r\ncrime and outrage, and these considerable powers which they are laboring\r\nto put down? There are two courses they might pursue. If there were\r\ngrounds for this imputation, the Attorney-General ought to have searched\r\nthe evidence in all the numerous prosecutions the Government have\r\ninstituted, and to have shown from that evidence that witnesses\r\ntestified, and that judicial authority acknowledged, facts which tended\r\nto show that a connection existed between crime and the National League,\r\nand crime and the Plan of Campaign.\r\n\r\nNot the smallest attempt was made by the honorable and learned gentleman\r\nor by the Government to do anything of the kind. The reason was that\r\nthey could find no such evidence, and I give no credit to the Plan of\r\nCampaign or to the National League for the absence of such evidence,\r\nbecause to encourage crime on the part of either, or to tolerate it,\r\nwould be suicidal to them. (_Cheers._) The right honorable gentleman\r\nmight have pursued the course which I took in 1881, when arguing the\r\nunhappy bill of that year (unhappy as to the nature of its provisions),\r\nwhich was designed to meet what was at the time a most threatening\r\nevil. I argued that the Land League, as i operated at that time, was an\r\norganization imparting danger to the country. I showed, or tried to\r\nshow, that wherever you traced the footsteps of the League, you traced\r\nthe increase of crime. The Attorney-General did not pursue that course,\r\nbecause he knew it would result in total failure. Therefore I think we\r\nhave evidence before us, so far as it goes, and it goes pretty far, to\r\nshow that as regards these great objects which the Government have had\r\nin view, of putting down the National League and the Plan of Campaign,\r\ntheir efforts have resulted in total failure.\r\n\r\nWhether it be the Land Act, with its beneficial or imperfect provisions,\r\nor whether it be that dawning of the rays of hope, that beginning of the\r\nknitting together of the heart of one nation to the heart of the other,\r\nthe diminution of crime is a matter of rejoicing, and we wish it were\r\ngreater, we congratulate the Government, and we heartily hope that in\r\nthe hands of beneficial and benign causes it may continue to decrease.\r\nWell, such is the retrospect. What is the prospect? What is to come?\r\nWill the Government continue still to deal with signs, and never to look\r\nat the substance, to legislate against symptoms and manifestations and\r\nnever to touch the disease, to try and prune off from the rankly\r\nluxurious vegetation, here a twig and there a leaf, and never to ask\r\nthemselves whether the proper purpose and design is not to bring it out\r\nby the roots? There are many things which are said by the Government in\r\ndebate, but there is one thing which they and their supporters most\r\nrarely say. I think, as far as my recollection and experience goes, I\r\nmay almost venture to go further, and assert they never say,--I never\r\nhad heard them express a confidence that they will be able to establish\r\na permanent resistance to the policy of Home Rule. (_Opposition\r\ncheers._)\r\n\r\nI am glad not to be met with adverse challenges when I say this. If this\r\nbe a question of time at all, then it is most important to consider what\r\nis the right time. I don't disguise any more than the honorable member\r\nfor East Cork the strength of the combinations that are opposed to us.\r\nThey are very strong indeed; they have nearly the whole wealth of the\r\ncountry; they have nearly the whole of the high station of the country;\r\nthey have most of the elements of social strength which abound in them;\r\nthey have with these all the things which belong to wealth, to rank, and\r\nto station in this country, which is vast in its amount, they are very\r\nstrong, and by their strength they may secure delay, but delay in a\r\nsubject of this kind, a controversy of nations, is not an unmixed good.\r\nIt has its dangers and its inconveniences. You are happily free at this\r\nmoment from the slighest shadow of foreign complications. You have at\r\nthis moment the constitutional assent of Ireland, pledged in the most\r\nsolemn form, for the efficacy of the policy which I am considering. But\r\nthe day may come when your condition may not be so happy. I do not\r\nexpect, any more than I desire, these foreign complications, but still\r\nit is not wise wholly to shut them out.\r\n\r\nWhat I fear is rather this, that if resistance to the national voice of\r\nIreland be pushed too far, those who now guide the mind of that nation\r\nmay gradually lose their power, and may be supplanted and displaced by\r\nruder and more dangerous spirits. These very institutions, the National\r\nLeague and the Plan of Campaign, which would vanish into thin air upon a\r\nrational settlement of the Irish difficulty, might with their power\r\ndrive such deep roots into the soil, they might acquire such a mastery,\r\nif not over the understandings, over the passions of the people, for\r\npassions in these cases will always be let loose, they might acquire a\r\nstrength which may enable them hereafter to offer serious hindrances to\r\ngovernment which is good. I venture to express a hope that there will be\r\ndeeper reflection upon these matters. In the present administration of\r\nIreland, it is too plain you are endeavoring to do what the language of\r\nLord Salisbury shows is too clearly your intention, what has long been\r\nendeavored, but under circumstances wholly different. For seven hundred\r\nyears, with Ireland practically unrepresented, with Ireland prostrate,\r\nwith the forces of this great and powerful island absolutely united, you\r\ntried and failed to do that which you are now trying to do with Ireland\r\nfully represented in your Parliament, with Ireland herself raised to a\r\nposition which is erect and strong, and with the mind of the people so\r\ndevoted that if you look to the elections of the last twelve months you\r\nfind that the majority of the people have voted in favor of the\r\nconcession of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nIf this is to continue, I would venture to ask gentlemen opposite under\r\nsuch circumstances as these, and with the experience you have, is your\r\npersistence in this system of administration, I will not say just, but\r\nis it wise, is it politic, is it hopeful, is it conservative?\r\n(_Cheers._) Now, at length, bethink yourselves of a change, and consent\r\nto administer, and consent finally to legislate for Ireland and for\r\nScotland in conformity with the constitutionally expressed wishes and\r\nthe profound and permanent convictions of the people; and ask yourselves\r\nwhether you will at last consent to present to the world the spectacle\r\nof a truly and not a nominally United Empire. (_Loud Opposition\r\ncheers._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. O'BRIEN'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. W. O'BRIEN rose amid loud and prolonged cheers from the Irish\r\nmembers, and speaking for the first time in this House since his release\r\nfrom Tullamore Jail, said: All the speeches which have been made in\r\nsupport of the Government have seemed to follow the keynote struck by\r\nthe Chief Secretary. They all appeared to be more or less artfully\r\ndesigned to draw angry retorts from these benches. It is one of our\r\nnational faults to be very ready to resent injustice, and a most\r\ngenerous use our opponents have made of that characteristic. (\"_Hear,\r\nhear._\") The whole policy of our opponents towards Ireland, and the\r\nwhole object of the powerful London newspapers, seems to be to get at\r\nthe worst side of Irish and of English character, and to sting and goad\r\nus into doing things which will put new life into national prejudices\r\nthat are expiring in spite of you. (_Opposition cheers._) Irishmen and\r\nEnglishmen are becoming only too united for your purpose. Yours is a\r\nnoble ambition! But you have failed in Ireland, and you will fail, I\r\npromise you, in this House also. There was a time when we came here with\r\nour hand against every man's, and every man's hand against us. We\r\nexpected no quarter, and to the best of our ability we gave none. It\r\nseemed to no purpose to struggle against the tremendous and cruel forces\r\narrayed against us; but that is all at an end forever, thanks to the\r\nright honorable member for Mid-Lothian. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nWe have come to this House no longer as enemies among enemies. We count\r\nourselves Ishmaelites no longer in this House, nor in this land of\r\nEngland. We are now among allies and friends who were not ashamed nor\r\nafraid to stand by our side and by the side of our people in many a\r\nbitter hour of trial and calumny last year. (_Opposition cheers._) We\r\ncome here now among a people whose consciences, I believe, have been\r\ndeeply stirred by the sufferings of our unfortunate people; and though\r\nwe are confronted by a hostile majority, callous to those sufferings, we\r\nknow that that majority does not represent Scotland and Wales.\r\n(_Opposition cheers._) We believe that it does not even represent\r\nEngland. (_Renewed Opposition cheers, and counter Ministerial cheers._)\r\nIt is a majority obtained by foul means and upon representations which\r\nhave turned out to be utterly false. We know that it is a majority who,\r\ntwo years ago, were not ashamed to receive their offices at the hands of\r\nthe men whom they are now libelling in England and torturing in Ireland.\r\n(_Loud Opposition cheers._) We have no respect for that majority. I\r\ndoubt whether in their secret hearts many of them have much respect for\r\nthemselves. (\"_Hear, hear._\") I know very well that they are extremely\r\nill at ease. We believe, as I say, that we are winning. (_Cheers._) The\r\nright honorable gentleman opposite (the Chief Secretary) has failed in\r\nIreland. (_Home Rule cheers._) He has failed to smash our organization.\r\nHe has failed to break the spirit of our people. He has failed to\r\ndegrade us, I won't say in the eyes of our countrymen, for that would be\r\nabsurd, but in the eyes of every honest man within these three realms.\r\nHe has failed in every one of those calculations in which he indulged so\r\nconfidently last autumn.\r\n\r\nI shall prove before I sit down that failure is written on every clause\r\nand upon every provision of this act, abject failure, discomfiture, and\r\ndisgrace. I shall be able to prove that sorely as our people have been\r\ntried and wronged, that they have managed to survive one of the most\r\nhorrible Coercion Acts that has ever been directed against human\r\nliberty: that they have been able to crush and baffle it at every point,\r\nand that without one deed that they look upon with shame, but by sheer\r\nforce of an incomparable national feeling. (_Cheers._) Now, in the first\r\nplace, I shall try to deal very shortly with my own case; and if I refer\r\nto it at all, it is, not in order to notice the coarse sneers of the\r\nhonorable member for South Tyrone (Mr. T. W. Russell),--I do not think\r\nit would be as parliamentary as it is true to say malignant sneers\r\n(\"_Hear, hear_\"),--I think it possible that before very long those\r\nsneers may be answered in the only way they deserve, by the electors of\r\nSouth Tyrone,--it is because I recognize that I am the very worst\r\nparliamentary criminal under this act. I am the only one who could have\r\nbeen proceeded against under the ordinary common law, with the shadow of\r\na chance of conviction. Every colleague of mine who has been punished is\r\nbeing punished for new and statutable offences for which no jury in the\r\nworld would convict under the ordinary law. The point I press upon the\r\nHouse is that if I can justify my offence, then I say, with a thousand\r\ntimes more force, the conviction of every one of my colleagues is an\r\noutrage upon justice, and their treatment in prison is an indelible\r\ndisgrace to the man who planned it. I find that foul misrepresentation\r\nhas been resorted to to mislead and to deceive the English public as to\r\nthe offence for which I was sentenced.\r\n\r\nWithin the last week I have been reading the papers, and I am sorry to\r\nfind that Lord Salisbury was not above stooping to encourage and to lead\r\nthis attempt most unfairly and untruly to poison the English mind\r\nagainst me. He made a speech at Oxford, in which he indulged in flouts\r\nand gibes at my own humble expense. I do not complain of that. It is not\r\nthe first time that he has been accused of making flouts and gibes at\r\nthe expense of persons with whom he was more intimately allied than he\r\nis with me. (_Opposition cheers and laughter._) But here is how this\r\ngreat nobleman describes my case to an English audience. He says, \"What\r\nis there in the case of Mr. O'Brien to make him a martyr?\" And then he\r\ngoes on with his creditable witticisms. He says, \"I do not refer to his\r\nsmall clothes. (_Laughter._) Their vicissitudes would furnish a theme\r\nfor an epic (_rewewed laughter_), and I hope an Irish bard will arise\r\nworthy of the subject. (_Continued laughter._) But taking the man apart\r\nfrom his clothes.\" (_Roars of laughter; Ministerial cheers._) I notice\r\nthat your cheers do not rise to a roar. (_Opposition cheers._) I do not\r\nanswer these remarks. The noble lord went on, \"What is there to excite\r\nthe sympathy of the loyal subjects of England? He broke the law; he\r\nincited others to break the law, and recommended that the men who were\r\nendeavoring to collect just debts should be met with violence. In\r\nconsequence of his recommendation, they were met with violence. They\r\nwere scalded with hot water, and some of them were brought next to\r\ndeath's door. What is there to excite the sympathy of the loyal\r\nsubjects of England?\" (_Cries of \"Nothing.\"_)\r\n\r\nNow I shall tell you briefly the circumstances under which my advice was\r\ngiven, and the results of that advice. I will ask any candid man in\r\nEngland, after he has heard me, whether that speech of Lord Salisbury is\r\nnot calculated to convey to the average Englishman an impression, so\r\nfalse, so misleading, that I am afraid I should be obliged to travel\r\nbeyond the region of parliamentary epithets to characterize it. Now, on\r\nthe 2d of August, this House had, practically speaking, passed the Land\r\nBill, enabling over a thousand people of Mitchelstown, who were\r\nleaseholders, to have their rents revised. On the 8th of August, word\r\nreached me that the police and the military were gathering in\r\nMitchelstown to carry out an eviction campaign. The effect of that\r\ncampaign would have been to forestall all the operations of the Land\r\nBill, and, practically speaking, to defeat the intentions of Parliament,\r\nand to fling these poor people naked upon the world before the relief,\r\nwhich was actually entering the door, could reach them. (_Opposition\r\ncheers._) That was technically legal for the landlord for a few days\r\nlonger, but I hold that if ever there was a crime committed against\r\nsociety, it was that which was being attempted the day I went down to\r\nMitchelstown. Well, but what was to be done? If the right honorable\r\nbaronet, the late member for West Bristol (Sir M. Hicks-Beach), were\r\nstill Chief Secretary, at all events, in his early manner, we might have\r\nhad some hope that the Queen's troops would not have been made\r\naccomplices in such an act.\r\n\r\nOn the day I reached Mitchelstown, on the appeal of these poor people, I\r\nfound that evictions had already been carried out on the non-residential\r\nholdings, where there was no possibility of resistance. Ah! It is an old\r\nstory in Ireland. No mercy for the weak who can make no resistance, no\r\nscruple about perpetrating a wrong when it can be done in the dark.\r\n(_Home Rule cheers._) That was the bitter thought which passed through\r\nmy mind that day, when these poor people, my own constituents, came to\r\nme in helplessness and despair, to know what was to be done to save them\r\nfrom the ruin that was impending. There was just one hope for these\r\npeople in all the world, and it was this. The Northwich election was\r\npending (_Opposition cheers_), and the Irish evictions were an awkward\r\ntopic for a Tory candidate. The stories of Glenbeigh and Bodyke were\r\nbeginning to horrify the English mind. I knew that Tory statesmen would\r\nnot scruple to lend troops if it could be done without commotion, but I\r\nthought they might hesitate, lest they should lose the Northwich\r\nelection. I had not a moment to consult anybody, and absolutely on my\r\nown responsibility, and on the spur of the moment, I did there and then,\r\nin the open square of Mitchelstown, and in the hearing of a number of\r\npolicemen, tell the people if, under these special circumstances, the\r\nevictions were carried out before the Land Bill, which was almost law,\r\ndid become law, it would be no outrage of the law, and that they would\r\nbe justified before God and man in defending their homes by every honest\r\nmeans. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nI might have been right, or I might have been wrong. I have no doubt\r\nthat technically it was illegal for me to save the people, as it was\r\nlegal for the landlords in a few days to ruin them. Technically\r\nspeaking, I dare say, it would be an evasion of the law to hold the arm\r\nof an executioner if the executioner and I knew that a reprieve was\r\nactually arriving. That was precisely the case with these poor people.\r\nThe reprieve was coming, and the reprieve has come. (_Cheers._) Whether\r\nI was right or wrong in law, the result proved that I did not\r\nmiscalculate the statesmanship and the morality of the Tory Government.\r\nWhat happened? The moment that it became evident that those eviction\r\nscenes would ring throughout England, the eviction campaign was\r\nabandoned. The very day I made that speech in Mitchelstown, all was\r\npeace with the tenants. Not another eviction took place, and Captain\r\nPlunkett, who came down to superintend the eviction campaign, remained,\r\nI am glad to say, and proud to say, only to turn his energies to getting\r\nup a prosecution against me. Not a single eviction has taken place there\r\nfrom that day to this; not an act of violence has been committed; not a\r\nblow has been struck; not a single hair has been injured of any police\r\nofficer or bailiff in consequence of that speech of mine. Not one; and\r\nyet Lord Salisbury is not ashamed to say what he did.\r\n\r\nWhat was the result? That those poor tenants, who but for our\r\naction--but for the action of John Mandeville and myself--would have\r\nbeen beggared and homeless men, were able to take advantage of the Land\r\nAct, such as it was, while we were in prison. A Land Sub-Commission,\r\ncarefully chosen, was sent down to the Mitchelstown estate to prophesy\r\nagainst us, and to prove the guilt and the dishonesty of the Plan of\r\nCampaign. But they could not do it. These picked Tory officials, two of\r\nthem convicted rack-renters, were obliged to declare that these poor\r\ntenants were entitled to remain in their homes, and on lower terms and\r\nat a lower rent than had been demanded. (_Loud cheers._) What has\r\nhappened since? The landlord has actually taken refuge from the judgment\r\nof even a Tory Land Commission in the moderation of the Plan of\r\nCampaign. Three days ago my honorable friend and collegue, the member\r\nfor South Tipperary, signed, sealed, and delivered a treaty which\r\nsecures these poor people safely to their homes. This is the transaction\r\nas to which Lord Salisbury is not ashamed to say that I \"recommended\r\nthat the men who were employed by the Crown in the recovery of just\r\ndebts should be met with violence, and that in consequence, some were\r\nmaltreated and scalded and brought to death's door.\" (_Opposition, cries\r\nof \"Shame.\"_) The fact is, that not a single act of violence took place\r\nin any way on the estate after my speech. But justice was secured to\r\nthose people and their children in their homes. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nIf there is anybody who has reason to blush at the name of Mitchelstown,\r\nand to remember Mitchelstown apart from the blood that was shed there, I\r\nshould think it is not I, but her Majesty's Government. They had neither\r\nthe humanity to forbid these evictions, nor the courage to persevere\r\nwith them. They superintended and sanctioned them as long as there was\r\nany prospect of resistance; they had the cowardice to abandou them the\r\nmoment they threatened to become inconvenient to a Tory candidate, and\r\nthey had the incredible meanness, while my hands were bound in prison,\r\nto present a story to the English people, in a false and untruthful\r\nguise, in order to reconcile Englishmen to having me treated worse than\r\na thief or a cutthroat, for saving my own constituents from the fate\r\nwhich now the Land Commissioners and everybody on this earth acknowledge\r\nwould have been a most unmerited and a most awful calamity. I won't\r\nweary the House by going into all the miserable circumstances, all the\r\nfoul play, and the violence and the indecencies that were resorted to\r\nagainst us. Unfortunately they are common-place and every-day\r\noccurrences in Ireland, through the infamous tribunals you have set up.\r\nI certainly am not going to enter into any recital of the miserable\r\nlittle prison torments and iniquities that were employed to give us pain\r\nand humiliation, and to besmirch the character of the Irish\r\nrepresentatives in the eyes of the people of England and Ireland. I\r\nthink we can afford to pass these things by. I believe that our\r\nopponents are not all so lost to generous and manly sentiments as not to\r\nfeel ashamed rather than exultant about the Chief Secretary's exploits.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of opponents. I am sorry to think that men who\r\nare capable of inflicting pain of this description are quite capable of\r\nderiving a still keener pleasure in knowing that the torments have told,\r\nand that their victims smart under their wounds. I cannot gratify them,\r\nfor the simple reason that I do not feel wounded. I do not feel in the\r\nleast degraded. I rather suspect that the right honorable gentleman,\r\nunder his jaunty bearing, has his conscience not quite so easy as mine.\r\nI confess that I did feel keenly when in prison a letter which the right\r\nhonorable gentleman published to a Mr. Armitage, not making any honest\r\ncharge against me, but conveying a stealthy and loathsome insinuation\r\nthat I sheltered myself under the plea of illness from being forced to\r\nwear prison dress. I challenge the right honorable gentleman to refer to\r\nany one of the three official doctors who examined me, for one tittle, I\r\nwill not say of foundation, but even of countenance, for such an\r\nassertion. (_Loud cheers._) Here we are now face to face. (_Great\r\ncheering from the Opposition._) I challenge him in defence of his own\r\ncharacter, for it is his own character that is at stake (_cheers_), to\r\nappeal to any one of those three officials to give him the slightest\r\ncountenance. (\"_Hear, hear._\")\r\n\r\nI have said I was angry about it when in prison, but since reading the\r\nletter over fully, I am angry no longer; I confess it would be an ample\r\nvengeance, if I were a much more vindictive man than I am, for a\r\nstatesman who had any reputation to lose, to pen such a letter.\r\n(_Cheers._) The letter conveyed a hideous and cowardly imputation\r\nagainst a man whose mouth was shut. (_Cheers._) That letter breathed in\r\nevery sentence of it the temper of a beaten and an angry man\r\n(_cheers_),--I was going to say, of an angry woman (_laughter and\r\ncheers_), but I don't want to say it, because it would be a gross libel\r\non a gentle and tender sex. (\"_Hear, hear._\") From all I have been able\r\nto learn in England since, I feel that it is no longer necessary for us\r\nto defend ourselves to the English people. (_Cheers._) I feel there is\r\nnot a Tory of the fifth or sixth magnitude, who really in his heart\r\nbelieves for one instant that Irish members are such poor creatures as\r\nto cry out against the appearance of a prison. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nThe honorable member for Tyrone (Mr. T. W. Russell) said that we\r\nattempted to set up a distinction between members of Parliament and the\r\npeasants, our comrades and friends who are convicted under the act.\r\nThere is not a shadow or a tittle of foundation for that statement.\r\n(\"_Hear, hear._\") We have claimed nothing for ourselves as members of\r\nParliament that we don't claim equally for every man convicted under the\r\nsummary clauses of the act; for if he is a criminal, there is no reason\r\nwhy he should not be tried before the ordinary tribunal. (\"_Hear,\r\nhear._\") We do not ask poor men to make a hard fight harder by\r\nresistance to prison rules; but if we win, they shall win as well as\r\nourselves. (\"_Hear, hear._\") Our position simply this: You are perfectly\r\nwelcome to treat us to all the punishments that your courts of law\r\nprescribe for the very vilest miscreant in society,--the plank bed, or\r\nbread-and-water diet-solitary chnfinement, or deprivation of books and\r\nwriting materials; you are perfectly welcome to heap every physical\r\ndegradation on us, if that is your generous and chivalrous treatment of\r\npolitical prisoners, and you will never hear a word of complaint from us\r\nif you stick to that; but if you not only do that, but go further, and\r\ntry and subject us to moral torture, from which criminals are altogether\r\nexempt, when you ask us to make a voluntary acknowledgement of our\r\nequality with criminals, then we say, \"No; we will die first (_cheers\r\nfrom Irish members_), and you will have to learn the distinction between\r\nyour criminal classes and Irish political prisoners, even if it should\r\ntake a coroner's jury and their verdict to make the distinction.\"\r\n(_Loud cheers._) I can only say that if any one has reason to blush, it\r\nis not we. (\"_Hear, hear._\") I hope I am not detaining the House.\r\n(_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can plead is, that I shall not have an opportunity very\r\nsoon of claiming your attention; but I should like to ask, \"Where is all\r\nthis to end?\" What object has it accomplished? and if it is to go on for\r\never and for ever, what object can it ever possibly accomplish, except\r\nmisery to a weak people and eternal worry and shame to yourselves?\r\n(_Cheers._) Is it the object of the right honorable gentleman to convert\r\nthe Irish people, or to dragoon them out of the aspirations which are as\r\ndeeply lodged in the breasts of millions of men as the blood in their\r\nhearts? Does the right honorable gentleman in his wildest hour imagine\r\nthat he has made one single genuine convert through the length and\r\nbreadth of Ireland? (_Cheers._) Even to take it on the lower and meaner\r\nsphere of brute force, I ask the right honorable gentleman to name one\r\nsingle village club that he has effectually stamped out. (_Cheers._) Can\r\nhe produce a single man from our ranks that he has really frightened, as\r\nthe result of all the terrific power that he has been wielding in\r\nIreland?\r\n\r\nI ask honorable gentlemen opposite to remember with what a shout of\r\nexultation they passed the Crimes Act last session, and how they\r\ntriumphed over us. I can well remember the shouts and peals of delight\r\nwith which they welcomed the declaration of the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, I think, when he said this was to be a duel to the death\r\nbetween the National League and the Government, and that they accepted\r\nthe challenge. Well, are they satisfied with the results? (_Cheers and\r\nlaughter._) I ask honorable gentlemen whether they would have yelled so\r\nloudly last autumn if they could have foreseen the results of the most\r\nterrible Coercion Act ever passsd, giving the most unchecked powers that\r\never a despot was armed with, would be so miserable and ignominious and\r\nmean? (_Cheers._) Did you or did you not expect that the act would crush\r\nthe National League? Honorable gentlemen are silent. (_Cheers._) I\r\nremember the shout of derision which came from the other side of the\r\nHouse when I ventnred to intimate a doubt whether the act, terrific as\r\nit looked, would succeed in crushing the Plan of Campaign. Has it been\r\ncrushed, or even crippled? (_Cheers._) Ask the deputation of Irish\r\nlandlords (_laughter and cheers_) who waited on Lord Salisbury the other\r\nday with a begging letter,--ask them how many of them would be willing\r\nto try a fall with the Plan of Campaign in the morning. (_Cheers and\r\nlaughter._) It has never had so uniform and unbroken a course of\r\nvictories as it has had this winter.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the important struggles in which we were engaged\r\nwhen this act was passed has been brought to a victorious conclusion\r\nunder the mouths of the right honorable gentleman's guns. (_Cheers._)\r\nAnd upon what terms? I could speak for an hour, giving you instances of\r\nthe results; but the one thing that applies to them all is, that in\r\nevery single instance at least the original demands of the tenants have\r\nbeen acceded to. (\"_Hear, hear._\") Every evicted tenant has been\r\nreinstated (_cheers_), and every shilling of law costs incurred in the\r\nstruggle has been borne as an indemnity by the landlords. (_Cheers, and\r\n\"No.\"_) You could have got as good a result as that without the act. On\r\nLord de Freyne's estate, when the act was passing, the agent, Mr.\r\nM'Dougal, wrote this letter: \"Spot the men in your district who are able\r\nto pay and won't; we will see, now that the Coercion Act is about to\r\nbecome law, whether we won't make them honest men.\" It turned out that\r\nthe dishonest men beat Mr. M'Dougal and his master. They had confidence\r\nin the Crimes Bill and the right honorable gentleman last autumn. Where\r\nis Mr. M'Dougal to-day? He is gone, dismissed, and everything that the\r\ntenants were then demanding has been conceded.\r\n\r\nThe very day after I came out of prison, I learned that the new agent\r\nhad had an interview with two of the most prominent of the campaigners\r\non the estate, and he not only agreed to the tenants' terms, but he\r\nagreed to refund the sum of over £1,700, which Mr. M'Dougal had\r\ndishonestly extorted from the tenants before the Plan of Campaign.\r\n(_Cheers._) This money was wrung from the tenants by terror, by serving\r\none hundred and fifty writs of ejectment before they had the protection\r\nof the Plan of Campaign.\r\n\r\nThen as to the estate of Bodyke, where the proceedings last summer\r\nhorrified England, and for which her Majesty's Government could provide\r\nno remedy; what is the result? Last year, Mr. O'Callaghan, one of the\r\nhardest rack-renters, refused an offer of £907 for a year and a half's\r\nrent of fifty-seven tenants; he has now accepted £1,000 to wipe off two\r\nyears' rent of seventy-two tenants. (_Cheers and laughter._) That is to\r\nsay, after losing all his money, and after costing the British taxpayer\r\n£40,000 for the expenses of his evictions (_cheers_), he has now come to\r\nthe conclusion, and he is one of the most desperate of rack-renters,\r\nthat the Crimes Act is no go, and he has struck his flag to the Plan of\r\nCampaign upon worse terms for him by far than he would have got before\r\nthe passing of the Crimes Act. (_Cheers._) Only this very day a letter\r\ncame to my honorable friend, the member for East Mayo (Mr. Dillon), from\r\nthe principal man who stood almost between the living and the dead on\r\nthat estate,--the Rev. Peter Murphy,--in which the writer said: \"A\r\nthousand thanks for check. You have acted nobly by us, and we have every\r\nreason to thank and be grateful to you. What pleases me most of all is,\r\nthat our victory over Colonel O'Callaghan is complete, and approved by\r\nall who understand the matter fully. He did his utmost to get the\r\ntenants to purchase. He would have sold on any terms rather than yield\r\nto the plan, but we absolutely refused to purchase as long as the rope\r\nremained round our necks. (_Cheers._) We would not entertain the idea of\r\npurchasing at all, until restored to our holdings and free as the\r\nmountain air to meet him on equal terms.\" (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\n\"The next gale,\" the writer says, \"is not to be asked until the end of\r\nJune. Reductions suited to the different degrees of poverty, of fifteen\r\nper cent upwards to twenty-five and thirty per cent are secured.\"\r\n(_Cheers._) That is the way the right honorable gentleman is abating the\r\npower of the Plan of Campaign. (_Renewed cheers._) And remember that\r\nthese poor tenants have won in spite of him, not merely by adhering to\r\nthe Plan of Campaign, but also because every man of them who was evicted\r\nretook possession of his holding in defiance of the Crimes Act, and has\r\nheld possession of his holding for the last six months. (_Cheers._) And\r\nthe lesson the right honorable gentleman, this triumphant Cromwell\r\n(_laughter_), has taught them is that, thanks to their own pluck, and\r\nnot to his mercy, they are more secure in their homes to-day,--well,\r\nthan the right honorable gentleman was in his tenancy of the Treasury\r\nBench. (_Cheers and laughter._)\r\n\r\nI am at this moment officially aware of several estates where the\r\nstruggle is still proceeding. The landlords are placing their hopes, and\r\nare opening their negotiations, not with the right honorable gentleman,\r\nor with Dublin Castle, but with the man who sits there, my honorable\r\nfriend, the honorable member for East Mayo (_loud cheers_), and with\r\nother members of this criminal and illegal conspiracy; a conspiracy as\r\nto whose dishonesty we have heard so many homilies from honorable\r\ngentlemen opposite. Why, I sometimes wonder that the homilies they\r\naddress to us and to our suffering people upon the violations of the ten\r\ncommandments do not blister the lips that utter them. (\"_Hear, hear._\")\r\nThis dishonest conspiracy. No land court that has ever revised their\r\ndemands has been able to pronounce them to be other than most just and\r\nmoderate. (\"_Hear, hear._\")\r\n\r\nMy honorable friend, the member for Cork, mentioned the other night that\r\nthere were only three really great estates in Ireland on which the\r\nlandlords are offering any resistance. One of them is the Brooke estate,\r\nin the county of Wexford, where the agent, Captain Hamilton, is an\r\nemergency man by profession. (\"_Hear, hear._\") The second is Lord\r\nMassareene's property, in the county of Louth, where the agents also are\r\nemergency men by profession; and the third is the estate of Lord\r\nClanricarde. It must be a proud thing for Englishmen to know that the\r\nright honorable gentleman on that estate was exercising one of the most\r\nabominable systems of petty persecution that ever was practised, in\r\norder to strike down the defenders of those poor people, to smother\r\ntheir voices, and to tie their hands in their struggle with a man who in\r\nthe Queen's own law courts has been branded as a monster of cruelty and\r\navarice! (_Loud cheers._) I wish her Majesty's Government joy of all the\r\ncredit that they will get out of their holy alliance with Lord\r\nClanricarde (_\"Hear, hear,\" and laughter_), and I wish him joy of all\r\nthe rent he will get out of them. (_Cheers and laughter._)\r\n\r\nThe fact is, and there is no use in blinking it, that, instead of\r\noverthrowing the Plan of Campaign, the right honorable gentleman has\r\nonly made it more secure and more irrestible, by driving us to do our\r\nbusiness with less publicity. (\"_Hear, hear._\") The machinery of the\r\nplan has been now perfected to such a degree that we find that one\r\nsingle campaign on an estate is sufficient to keep the peace of a whole\r\ncounty. (_Cheers._) Aye, and to settle the rents of a whole county more\r\nsatisfactorily and more honestly than an army of land commissioners.\r\n(\"_Hear, hear._\") I will tell you why. It is a very simple reason.\r\nBecause the penalties of such a struggle are so heavy as to intimidate\r\nany tenantry from putting forward an unjust demand, and they are also\r\nsufficiently great to terrify a landlord from resisting a just demand.\r\n(\"_Hear, hear._\") It may be a rough-and-ready method; no doubt it is;\r\nbut what is the result? That in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred\r\nlast winter it succeeded without any struggle at all.\r\n\r\nI challenge honorable gentlemen who speak of the immorality and\r\ndishonesty of the Plan of Campaign,--I challenge the right honorable\r\ngentleman to name any single deed of outrage or of crime that is\r\ntraceable to the Plan of Campaign, from end to end of Ireland.\r\n(_Cheers._) I challenge him to name any one case in which the demands we\r\nhave put forward have been declared by any land commissioner or judical\r\ntribunal in the country to be dishonest or exorbitant. I challenge him\r\nmore than all to adduce to the House to-night one solitary case in which\r\nhe has succeeded, with all his powers and his terrors, in breaking up a\r\ncombination that was once formed on an estate. (_Cheers._) And remember\r\nalways that this Plan of Campaign is the merest segment of the Irish\r\ndifficulty. It is a mere rough-and-ready way, which has been found\r\neffective to cure the blunders of your legislation, and to cure your\r\nfolly in not closing with the bill of my honorable friend, the member\r\nfor Cork. (_Cheers._) My honorable friend and myself and others are the\r\nmere Uhlans and cadets to the army of millions of Irishmen who stand\r\nranked under the standard of my honorable friend, the member for Cork.\r\n(_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nNow, as to the National League, I want to examine the right honorable\r\ngentleman. (_Laughter._) We have heard it stated over and over again in\r\nmost portentious accents in this House, that the authority of the\r\nNational League and of her Majesty's Government could not co-exist in\r\nIreland; that either one or the other must pack up and go. What has all\r\nthis tall talk come to? (\"_Hear, hear._\") Is the Leage gone, or does it\r\nshow the slightest sign of going? There are eighteen hundred branches of\r\nthe National League in Ireland; rather more, I believe now, because the\r\nright honorable gentleman's act has added some more. (_Cheers._) Not\r\nmore than two hundred and fifty of those branches have been nominally\r\ngrappled with. There are about fifteen hundred branches, or over five\r\nsixths of the whole organization, on which not a finger has been laid.\r\nWhy? Is it that the right honorable gentleman has conceived a sudden\r\naffection for the National League? (_Laughter._) Is it that these\r\nbranches are declining in power, or is it that they have abated their\r\nprinciples one jot in terror? No; but because the Government has made\r\nsuch a disastrous and grotesque mess of their attempt to suppress a\r\ncouple of hundred branches that they dared not face the ridicule, the\r\ncolossal collapse, that would attend any attempt to grapple with the\r\nwhole of this organization. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nEverybody who knows the so-called suppressed counties of Kerry and Clare\r\nknows that the suppressed branches hold their meetings just as usual,\r\nunder the noses of the police. We know it by the figures and by the cash\r\nwhich comes that the subscriptions, instead of falling off, are\r\nincreasing. The resolutions are passed in the usual way, and I can tell\r\nyou they are regarded with more sacredness and more efficacy than usual\r\nby the whole community. I will read an extract from a branch report in\r\n_United Ireland_ the week before last (\"_Hear, hear_\"), one of these\r\nsuppressed branches which have, according to the local policeman,\r\ndisappeared from view. It says: \"A large representative meeting was held\r\non Monday, Mr. George Pomeroy in the chair.\" No concealment of names.\r\n\"Balloting for officers and committee took place with the following\r\nresult, after a most vigorous competition for offices (_Nationalist\r\ncheers_), the only emolument for which will probably be a couple of\r\nmonths in jail: J. O'Callan, 60 votes; G. Pomeroy, 58; S. O'Keefe, 56;\r\nD. Hanlon, 50; O'Leary, 60; Power, 44; Fitzpatrick, 47\"; and so on. \"The\r\nfirst five are elected.\" (_Nationalist cheers._)\r\n\r\nThere is no disguising the fact that your whole suppressive machinery,\r\nthe whole machinery for effectually suppressing the League, has totally\r\nbroken down, and for a very simple reason, because the act was conceived\r\nupon the theory that you were dealing with a people who were only pining\r\nto be delivered from the terrorism of the National League (_cheers_),\r\nwhereas you find to your cost you are dealing with a people who are the\r\nLeague themselves, ready to guard it with their lives, and to undergo\r\nany amount of torture rather than betray it. (_Nationalist cheers._) Why\r\ndo you not put the Secret Inquiry clauses in force for the purpose of\r\nsuppressing branches of the National League? Why! Because you know you\r\nwould have to send thousands of people to jail who would rather go there\r\nthan let you wring one tittle of information out of them. Your only\r\nother source is informers, and it is our proudest boast that with an\r\norganization numbering upwards of 500,000 men, up to this time you have\r\nnot been able to bring a single informer into the market, though no\r\ndoubt the market price of the article was never higher. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nI want the right honorable gentleman to tell us here to-night what he\r\nhas got by all his wild and vicious lunges against the Irish people. I\r\nhave no patience with talking of \"crime in Ireland,\" outside Kerry. The\r\nMoonlighters and the Government have had Kerry to themselves for the\r\nlast five or six years. Between them be it, and let them divide the\r\nhonors. (_Loud Nationalist cheers._) They tell us of a number of persons\r\npartially boycotted. I do not know what the local policeman may be\r\npleased to call \"persons partially boycotted\"; but I am pretty sure the\r\nlist would go up or down, according to the requirements of the\r\nGovernment. Let the right honorable gentleman give us a list of new\r\nland-grabbers who have taken farms (_cheers_), or let him give us a\r\nlist, and I only wish he would, of the land-grabbers who, since this act\r\nhas been put in force, have accepted their neighbors' farms. As to\r\nlegitimate boycotting, I shall always hold with the perfect right of the\r\ncommunity to exercise legitimate influence on men who for their own base\r\nand greedy purposes are the pests of society.\r\n\r\nI admit that there are two classes of victims at the mercy of the Chief\r\nSecretary,--public speakers and public newspapers Public speeches are\r\nthe merest appendages of our organization. And why are public speakers\r\nat his mercy? Simply and solely because we do not choose to be driven\r\naway from our free right of public meeting, but choose to assert it, as\r\nMr. Blunt chose to assert it in the light of day. (_Cheers._) If we\r\nchoose to give our speeches in private, we could run a coach and four\r\nthrough the provisions of this act with absolute impunity. My friends\r\nhere were for months engaged on the Plan of Campaign. We have no secrets\r\nwe are afraid to acknowledge. (\"_Oh, oh._\") None. I only hope the\r\nhonorable gentleman who says \"Oh\"--(_an honorable member: \"Rochester\"._)\r\nCertainly. They have actually been for months and months on the business\r\nof the Plan of Campaign, even with warrants over their heads.\r\n\r\nTalk of me in connection with Mitchelstown. I may be giving the right\r\nhonorable gentleman a tip, but I do not object to say that my honorable\r\nfriend, the member for South Tipperary (Mr. J. O'Connor), was far and\r\naway a more formidable person than I was in the Plan of Campaign; but\r\nbecause he happens to be a man of few words, he will be walking in this\r\nlobby to-morrow night instead of reposing on a plank bed, as he would if\r\nhe had spoken. (_Cheers._) I do not mind telling it, and he will not\r\nmind it either, for his work, and he is victorious. I might say a good\r\ndeal about the meanness of this policy of subjecting journalists to\r\nmilk-and-water diet, for the simple fact that they recorded the right\r\nhonorable gentleman's failure (\"_Hear, hear_\"), because that is the\r\nsting of their offence,--because the meetings are held, and held in\r\nspite of the Government. (_Loud Nationalist cheers._) You might as well\r\nissue a proclamation suppressing the sun in the heavens, and then go\r\nabout smashing the faces of the sun-dials for recording that the sun is\r\nmoving on its way in spite of you. (_Laughter and cheers._) Worse still\r\nis it to attack the humble news venders, and intimidate their wives and\r\ntheir little children. (\"_Hear, hear._\")\r\n\r\nThe Chief Secretary might have remembered that the right honorable\r\ngentleman who sits next him (Mr. W. H. Smith) is a person who in former\r\nyears might easily have come under the same category. (_Nationalist\r\ncheers._) The right honorable gentlemen sold _United Ireland_ in his\r\nday. (\"_Hear, hear._\") I mention it not as a reproach to him, for he was\r\nan extremely good customer; but if he had not parted with his Irish\r\nbusiness as he did, under the subsequent legislation of this Government,\r\nthe right honorable gentleman would have been liable at this moment to\r\nthree months on a plank bed for having for six months sold the paper.\r\n(_Cheers._) I hope that chivalry on that side of the House has not died\r\nout, and that they will not resent in the case of a miserable shopkeeper\r\nat Killarney what they will condone in a Misister of England. I can\r\nspeak of my own knowledge of that policy, and its absolute and downright\r\nfailure, even against so vulnerable and perishable a property as we know\r\na newspaper is. But the right honorable gentleman has not succeeded in\r\nsuppressing a single newspaper, and he never will, although he has\r\nproceeded from the editors to the printers, and from the printers to the\r\nprinter's devils. (_Cheers._)\r\n\r\nThere is only one redeeming feature in the right honorable gentleman's\r\npolicy, and that is its colossal and monumental failure. That fact\r\nactually softens in the hearts of the Irish people the memory of the\r\natrocities he has committed against them. We feel that we have taken his\r\nmeasure now, and that we are a match for him. (_Irish cheers._) We feel\r\nthat he has failed, and that he will go on failing as long as grass\r\ngrows and water runs. We are almost grateful to him for what he has done\r\nto advance the Irish cause by awakening the consciences of Englishmen\r\n(_Opposition cheers_), by knitting the two peoples together in common\r\nhuman sympathy, and common abhorrence of the brutal and cruel system of\r\nterrorism which he is exhibiting in full working order in Ireland. The\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer claimed at Hastings that at all events the\r\nChief Secretary had held his own. This was rather a meek and unassuming\r\nclaim, after the high and swelling boasts that we heard from the same\r\nlips in the palmy days of last session. (_Cheers._) But has he even held\r\nhis own? He has demoralized every department of his own Irish\r\ngovernment, and every class of his own officials. There is not an office\r\nin Dublin Castle that is not at this moment subjected to as much\r\nespionage and as many precations against betrayal as if it were the\r\npalace of the Czar. (\"_Hear hear._\") He has the distinction of having\r\ndeveloped an entirely new phase of the Irish difficulty among her\r\nMajesty's soldiers.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mandeville and myself were whirled away by special train in\r\nthe middle of the night to Tullamore, and I confess I felt considerably\r\nconsoled when I heard that the next use the right honorable gentleman\r\nhad to make of a special train was to take her Majesty's soldiers away\r\nfrom Tullamore for cheering Mandeville and myself. (_Laughter and\r\ncheers._) Don't let him ride off on the statement that these were mere\r\nIrish soldiers. Some of them were, no doubt; but there were also his own\r\ncountrymen, the Scottish Fusileers. (_Cheers._) By some unhappy accident\r\nthey too had to be hurried off by special train for some awkward\r\nmanifestations at Mitchelstown. The right honorable gentleman had to\r\nemploy police patrols to watch the prison officials. He cannot even\r\ncount on the Royal Irish Constabulary, for to my own knowledge he had to\r\nemploy policemen to watch the police. (_Laughter and cheers._) That is\r\nwhat is called \"holding his own in Ireland.\" He succeeded only in\r\nkicking out a few of the bonfires that were lighted on the occasion of\r\nour release; but the spirit of nationality that lighted them is beyond\r\nhis power. It will burn when the memory of his unhappy time in Ireland\r\nwill be a mere speck among the dark clouds of misgovernment, which are\r\npassing away into a forgotten and forgiven past.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman and his friends plead for a little more\r\ntime. There are in this House many members who can remember Mr.\r\nForster's triumphant account of his experience at Tullamore; that he was\r\nwinning; that the people were with him; that the followers of my\r\nhonorable friend (Mr. Parnell) were a mere back of broken men and\r\nreckless boys, and that you had only to give him (Mr. Forster) a little\r\nmore time to make his victory appear to all the world. That was seven\r\nyears ago; but the triumph has not appeared. Does the wildest man in\r\nthis House imagine that the second Tullamore experience will be more\r\nsuccessful? Does the Chief Secretary's best friend claim that he is a\r\ncleverer man or a more profound statesman than Mr. Forster? He is no\r\ndoubt in a position to inflict untold suffering on our poor people. I do\r\nnot deny that it is no child's play for us. No man's health is exactly\r\nthe same after imprisonment of the sort that some of my poor friends are\r\nenduring to-night; but the sufferings in the prison cell are only small\r\ncompared with those that the Chief Secretary is bringing on many a\r\nhumble family (\"_Hear, hear_\"), to say nothing of the petty persecution\r\nthat is going on at the hands of every village constable who has a\r\nquarrel with the people, and of the confusion, uncertainty, and ruin\r\ninto which the right honorable gentleman is plunging the whole business\r\nof the country. It is a burning shame that such an ordeal should be\r\ninflicted on a people whose only desire is to live in peace, and to rule\r\nin peace in their own land. (\"_Hear, hear._\") It is sometimes almost\r\nunbearable, but the Irish people will bear it. We are not cowed. We are\r\nnot even embittered.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable member for Mid-Lothian has accomplished in two years\r\nwhat seven hundred years of coercion had not accomplished previously\r\n(_Irish cheers_), and what seven hundred more would leave unaccomplished\r\nstill. He has united the hearts of the two peoples by a more sacred and\r\nenduring bond than that of terror and brute force; and our quarrel with\r\nEngland, our bitterness toward England, is gone. (_Cheers._) And it will\r\nbe your fault and your crime if it ever returns,--a crime for which\r\nhistory will stigmatize you forever. We, at all events, are not\r\ndisruptionists. (_Cheers and counter cheers._) It is you who are the\r\ndisruptionists and the exasperationists and the separatists. We have\r\nnever made a disguise of our feelings. We say what we mean.\r\n\r\nThe right honorable gentleman, the member for Newcastle, and many\r\nanother good friend beside him, have been over in Ireland this winter,\r\nand they can tell you that when the name of England is uttered now in an\r\nIrish crowd, it is no longer uttered with hatred, but with hope and with\r\ngratitude to those awakening British hearts which have never authorized\r\nthis policy of the Government in Ireland. You are the Separatists. We\r\nare for peace and for happiness, and for the brotherhood of the two\r\nnations. You are for eternal repression and eternal discord and eternal\r\nmisery for yourselves, as well as for us. We are for appeasing the dark\r\npassions of the past. You are for inflaming them, whether for purposes\r\nof a political character I do not know, but for purposes in the\r\ninterests of that wretched class of Mamelukes whom you support in\r\nIreland, who are neither good Englishmen nor good Irishmen, and who are\r\nbeing your evil genius in Ireland, just as they have been the scourge\r\nof our unhappy people.\r\n\r\nThat is the state of things; and in such a cause and between such\r\nforces, I believe the end is not far off, and to the God of justice and\r\nof liberty and of mercy, we leave the issue. So far as we ourselves are\r\nconcerned, we shall be amply compensated, whatever we have suffered and\r\nmay have to suffer in our grand old cause, if we can be sure that we are\r\nthe last of that long and mournful line of men who have suffered for it.\r\nAnd, believe me, upon the day of our victory, we will grant an easy\r\namnesty to the right honorable gentleman opposite for our little\r\ntroubles in Tullamore, and we will bless his policy yet as one of the\r\nmost powerful, though unconscious, instruments in the deliverance of\r\nIreland. (_Loud Opposition cheers._)\r\n\r\nMr. FINLAY (_who arose amid loud cries of \"Balfour\" from the Opposition\r\nand Home Rule benches_) said that the honorable member who had just\r\nspoken had charged the Unionist party with inflaming passions and\r\nanimosity in Ireland that were in a fair way of dying out. He was not\r\naware of any section of the party against which that charge could be\r\nmade. It had always been the mission of the Unionist party to see that\r\nequal justice should be done in Ireland, and to appease those\r\nanimosities which were the relics of past misgovernment and past\r\nmisfortunes. They believed that in a country so divided as Ireland was,\r\nequal justice might best be done in an Imperial Parliament, and not by\r\nhanding over one part of the country to the domination of another. The\r\nhonorable member had said that there was no bitterness on the part of\r\nthe Irish members towards England. But the party had three voices. One\r\nwas the voice that spoke in the House of Commons, the second the voice\r\nthat spoke in Ireland; but to get at the real springs of the movement,\r\nthey must hear it on an American platform. (_Ministerial cheers._) He\r\nobjected to that House being turned into a court of appeal from judicial\r\nsentences in Ireland, and he regretted to have heard the cheers which\r\ncame from the Opposition side of the House when the honorable member for\r\nWest Cork had said that he recommended the tenants at Mitchelstown to\r\nresist the law by force.
