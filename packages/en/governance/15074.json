Until\r\nrecently the fact has been overlooked that before he wrote the first of\r\nthese satires, _Absalom and Achitophel_, he had entered the political\r\narena with the prose tract here reproduced. The proof that the\r\nHistoriographer Royal contributed to the anti-Whig propaganda of the\r\nspring of 1681 depends partly on contemporary or near-contemporary\r\nstatements but principally on internal evidence. An article by Professor\r\nRoswell G. Ham (_The Review of English Studies_, XI (1935), 284-98; Hugh\r\nMacdonald, _John Dryden, A Bibliography_, p. 167) demonstrated Dryden's\r\nauthorship so satisfactorily that it is unnecessary to set forth here\r\nthe arguments that established this thesis. The time when Dryden was\r\ncomposing his defence of the royal _Declaration_ is approximately fixed\r\nfrom the reference to it on June 22, 1681, in _The Observator_, which\r\nhad noted the Whig pamphlet Dryden was answering under the date of May\r\n26.\r\n\r\nThe bitter controversy into which Dryden thrust himself was the\r\nculmination of eleven years' political strife. In 1670, by the secret\r\nTreaty of Dover, Charles II and Louis XIV agreed that the English king\r\nshould declare himself a Roman Catholic, and receive from his brother of\r\nFrance the equivalent of 80,000 pounds sterling and, in case of a\r\nProtestant rebellion, 6000 French soldiers. In addition, the two kings\r\nwere pledged to undertake a war for the partition of the United\r\nProvinces. In the words of the late Lord Acton this treaty is \"the solid\r\nsubstance of the phantom which is called the Popish Plot.\" (_Lectures on\r\nModern History_ (1930), p. 211) The attempt to carry out the second part\r\nof the treaty was made in 1672, when England and France attacked the\r\nUnited Provinces which made a successful defence, aided by a coalition\r\nincluding the Emperor, Elector of Brandenburg, and King of Spain. The\r\nunpopularity of the war compelled Charles II to make peace in 1674.\r\nMeanwhile the King had taken a step to put into operation the first part\r\nof the Treaty of Dover by issuing a Declaration of Indulgence relieving\r\nCatholics and Dissenters alike from the penal laws. He was forced,\r\nhowever, to withdraw it and to give his assent to the Test Act which\r\nexcluded from all public offices those unwilling to take the sacraments\r\naccording to the rites of the Church of England. Henceforth Charles II\r\nabandoned all hope of restoring Catholicism, though his brother and\r\nheir, James, Duke of York, already a convert, remained resolute to\r\nsecure at least toleration for his co-religionists. But many Englishmen\r\ncontinued to suspect the royal policy.\r\n\r\nRoman Catholicism was feared and hated by many Englishmen for two\r\ndistinct reasons. The first was based on bigotry, nourished by memories\r\nof the Marian persecution, the papal bull dethroning Elizabeth, Guy\r\nFawkes' Plot, and by apprehensions that a Catholic could not be a loyal\r\nsubject so long as he recognized the temporal power of the Pope. The\r\nsecond was political and assumed that Catholicism was the natural\r\nsupport of absolutism. As Shaftesbury, the leader of the opposition,\r\nstated, popery and slavery went hand in hand. Such fears were deepened\r\nas the general purport of the Treaty of Dover became known.\r\n\r\nInto this atmosphere charged with suspicion was interjected the Popish\r\nPlot, said by Titus Oates and his fellow perjurers to be designed to\r\nmurder Charles II and place James on the throne. From September 1678,\r\nwhen Oates began his series of revelations until the end of March 1681,\r\nwhen the King dissolved at Oxford the third Parliament elected under the\r\nProtestant furore excited by the Plot, Shaftesbury and his followers had\r\nthe upper hand. The King was obliged to propose concessions to the\r\npopular will and to offer to agree to limitations on the authority of a\r\npopish successor. But Shaftesbury was bent on passing the Exclusion\r\nBill, which excluded James from the throne and substituted the King's\r\nillegitimate son, Monmouth. Here he made a fatal blunder because he\r\nalienated churchmen who believed in the divine right of kings, all whose\r\nsense of decency was outraged by the prospect of a bastard's elevation\r\nto the throne, and the supporters of William of Orange, husband of\r\nMary, the elder daughter of James, and the great opponent of Louis XIV.\r\nAlso, when it became obvious that the King would not agree to a change\r\nin the succession, many feared another civil war with all its attendant\r\ndangers of a second military domination. Moreover, the lies of Oates and\r\nhis imitators were becoming discredited.\r\n\r\nThough a reaction against the Whigs was beginning, propaganda was needed\r\nto disabuse the public of two anxieties--that there was still a danger\r\nthat Roman Catholicism might be restored and that the three dissolutions\r\nmight foreshadow a return to unparliamentary government such as Charles\r\nI had established from 1629 to 1640, also after three dissolutions. The\r\nroyal party was at first on the defensive. Their propaganda began with a\r\nproclamation issued on April 8 and ordered to be read in all churches.\r\nIn the proclamation the King posed as the champion of law and order\r\nagainst a disloyal faction trying to overthrow the constitution. It was\r\nread in churches on April 17 and, according to Luttrell's _Brief\r\nHistorical Relation_ (I, 77), \"in many places was not very pleasing, but\r\nafforded matter of sport to some persons.\" Among several replies was one\r\nentitled _A Letter from a Person of Quality to his Friend_. Clearly\r\nthere was need to answer this pamphlet and to state more fully the case\r\nagainst the Whigs. This task was undertaken by two of the greatest\r\nwriters of English prose--George Savile, then Earl, later Marquis of\r\nHalifax, and John Dryden. Halifax, in the tract lately identified as his\r\nby Hugh Macdonald (Cambridge, 1940), _Observations upon a late\r\nLibel_--though he might scarify an individual opponent like Shaftesbury\r\nor pour ridicule upon a sentence from _A Letter_, set himself the task\r\nof answering the Whig case as a whole. The text he dilated upon was:\r\n\"there seemeth to be no other Rule allowed by one sort of Men, than that\r\nthey cannot Err, and the King cannot be in the Right.\" With superb irony\r\nand wit he demonstrated how inconsistent such an attitude was with the\r\nconstitution of that day.\r\n\r\nDryden's tract, _His Majesties Declaration Defended_ is, like the one\r\nhe is answering, in the form of a letter to a friend who has asked the\r\nwriter's opinion of the _Declaration_ and the answer to it. \"I shall\r\nobey you the more willingly,\" Dryden responds, \"because I know you are a\r\nlover of the Peace and Quietness of your Country; which the Author of\r\nthis seditious Pamphlet, is endeavouring to disturb.\" He writes to show\r\nthe \"goodness and equity\" of the Prince, because once they are\r\nunderstood, the faction will lose its power and the well-meaning but\r\nmisled crowd will be no longer deceived by \"the specious names of\r\nReligion and Liberty.\" After these introductory paragraphs Dryden began\r\nto reply to the pamphlet point by point. His method is to quote or, more\r\nstrictly, partly to quote and partly to paraphrase, a sentence and then\r\nrefute its argument. In so doing he is following the method of the\r\nauthor of _A Letter_. Accordingly, to understand and judge the fairness\r\nof Dryden's refutation, it is well first to read _His Majesties\r\nDeclaration_, then _A Letter_, and finally Dryden. The first has not\r\nbeen reprinted in full but a substantial extract may be found in\r\nEchard's _History of England_ (III, 624-6) and in Arthur Bryant's _The\r\nLetters of Charles II_ (pp. 319-22), the second is available in a not\r\nuncommon folio, _State Tracts: being a Collection of several Treatises\r\n... privately printed in the Reign of K. Charles II_ (1689), and the\r\nthird is here reproduced for the first time. After the perusal of these\r\nthree tracts, the student may well turn to _Absalom and Achitophel_, and\r\nfind instruction in comparing the prose and the verse. He may reach the\r\nconclusion that while both were written to win converts to the royal\r\ncause, the first was designed to weaken the Whig party and the second to\r\ntake advantage of a tide that had turned to ruin the Whig leaders. (For\r\na fuller discussion of the relationship of Dryden's tract and his poem\r\nsee the writer's article, \"The Conclusion of Dryden's Absalom and\r\nAchitophel\" in the _Huntington Library Quarterly_, X (1946-7), 69-82.)\r\nIn addition to its historical interest Dryden's tract is a fine specimen\r\nof his masculine, vigorous style so well suited to controversial\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nI desire to thank Mr. James M. Osborn, Yale University, for helpful\r\nsuggestions in the preparation of this introduction.\r\n\r\nThis facsimile has been made from the copy in the William Andrews Clark\r\nMemorial Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Godfrey Davies_\r\n_The Huntington Library_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Majesties\r\n\r\nDECLARATION\r\n\r\nDEFENDED:\r\n\r\nIn a _LETTER_ to a Friend.\r\n\r\nBEING AN\r\n\r\n_ANSWER_\r\n\r\nTO A\r\n\r\n_Seditious Pamphlet_,\r\n\r\nCALLED\r\n\r\n_A LETTER from a Person of Quality\r\nto his Friend_:\r\n\r\nCONCERNING\r\n\r\nThe Kings late Declaration touching the Reasons\r\nwhich moved him to Dissolve\r\n\r\nTHE TWO LAST\r\n\r\n_PARLIAMENTS_\r\n\r\nAT\r\n\r\n_WESTMINSTER_ and _OXFORD_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_LONDON:_\r\nPrinted for _T. Davies, 1681_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\nKings Declaration\r\nDEFENDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nSince you are pleas'd to require my Opinion of the Kings Declaration,\r\nand the Answer to it, which you write me word was sent you lately, I\r\nshall obey you the more willingly, because I know you are a lover of the\r\nPeace and Quietness of your Country; which the Author of this seditious\r\nPamphlet, is endeavouring to disturb. Be pleas'd to understand then,\r\nthat before the Declaration was yet published, and while it was only the\r\ncommon news, that such an one there was intended, to justifie the\r\nDissolution of the two last Parliaments; it was generally agreed by the\r\nheads of the discontented Party, that this Declaration must be answer'd,\r\nand that with all the ingredients of malice which the ablest amongst\r\nthem could squeeze into it. Accordingly, upon the first appearance of it\r\nin Print, five several Pens of their _Cabal_ were set to work; and the\r\nproduct of each having been examin'd, a certain person of Quality\r\nappears to have carried the majority of Votes, and to be chosen like a\r\nnew _Matthias_, to succeed in the place of their deceas'd _Judas_.\r\n\r\nHe seems to be a man cut out to carry on vigorously the designs of the\r\nPhanatique Party, which are manifestly in this Paper, to hinder the\r\nKing, from making any good impression on his Subjects, by giving them\r\nall possible satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAnd the reason of this undertaking is manifest, for if once the goodness\r\nand equity of the Prince comes to be truly understood by the People, the\r\nAuthority of the Faction is extinguish'd; and the well meaning crowd who\r\nare misled, will no longer gape after the specious names of Religion and\r\nLiberty; much like the folly of the _Jews_, expecting a _Messiah_ still\r\nto come, whose History has been written sixteen hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThus much in general: I will now confider the Cavils of my Author\r\nagainst the Declaration.\r\n\r\nHe tells us, in the first place, _That the Declaration seems to him as a\r\nforerunner of another Parliament to be speedily call'd:_ And indeed to\r\nany man in his right sences, it can seem no other; for 'tis the business\r\nof its three last Paragraphs to inform the People, that no\r\nirregularities in Parliament can make the King out of love with them:\r\nbut that he looks upon them as the best means for healing the distempers\r\nof the publick, and for preservation of the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nNow if this seems clearly to be the Kings intention, I would ask what\r\nneed there was of the late Petition from the City, for another\r\nParliament; unless they had rather seem to extort it from his Majesty,\r\nthan to have it pass for his own gracious action? The truth is, there\r\nwere many of the Loyal Party absent at that Common Council: and the\r\nwhole strength of the other Faction was united; for it is the common\r\nfailing of honest men to trust too much in the goodness of their cause;\r\nand to manage it too negligently. But there is a necessity incumbent on\r\nsuch as oppose the establish'd Government, to make up with diligence,\r\nwhat they want in the justice of their undertaking. This was the true\r\nand only reason why the majority of Votes was for the Petition: but if\r\nthe business had not been carried by this surprise, My Lord Mayor might\r\nhave only been troubled to have carried the Addresses of _Southwark_,\r\n&c. of another nature: without his offering them with one hand, and the\r\nCity Petition with the other; like the Childrens play of, This Mill\r\ngrinds Pepper and Spice; that Mill grinds Ratts and Mice.\r\n\r\nIn the next place he informs us, _That if has been long the practice of\r\nthe Popish and Arbitrary Party, that the King should call, frequent,\r\nshort, and useless Parliaments, tell the Gentry, grown weary of the\r\ngreat expences of Elections, should sit at home, and trouble themselves\r\nno more but leave the People expos'd to the practices of them, and of\r\ntheir Party; who if they carry one House of Commons for their turn, will\r\nmake us Slaves and Papists by a Law_.\r\n\r\n_Popish_ and _Arbitrary_, are words that sound high amongst the\r\nmultitude; and all men are branded by those names, who are not for\r\nsetting up Fanaticism and a Common-wealth. To call short and useless\r\nParliaments, can be no intention of the Government; because from such\r\nmeans the great end of Settlement cannot be expected. But no Physician\r\ncan command his Physick to perform the effects for which he has\r\nprescrib'd it: yet if it fail the first or second time, he will not in\r\nprudence lay aside his Art, and despair of his Patient: but reiterate\r\nhis Medicines till he effect the cure. For, the King, as he declares\r\nhimself, is not willing to have too hard an Opinion of the\r\nRepresentatives of the Commons, but hopes that time may open their eyes,\r\nand that their next meeting may perfect the Settlement of Church and\r\nState. With what impudence can our Author say, _That an House of Commons\r\ncan possibly be so pack'd, as to make us Slaves and Papists by a Law?_\r\nfor my part I should as soon suspect they would make themselves\r\nArbitrary, which God forbid that any Englishman in his right sences\r\nshould believe. But this supposition of our Author, is to lay a most\r\nscandalous imputation upon the Gentry of _England_; besides, what it\r\ntacitly insinuates, that the House of Peers and his Majesty, (without\r\nwhom it could not pass into a Law,) would suffer it. Yet without such\r\nArtifices, as I said before, the Fanatique cause could not possibly\r\nsubsist: fear of Popery and Arbitrary power must be kept up; or the St.\r\n_Georges_ of their side, would have no Dragon to encounter; yet they\r\nwill never persuade a reasonable man, that a King, who in his younger\r\nyears, when he had all the Temptations of power to pursue such a Design,\r\nyet attempted it not, should now, in the maturity of his Judgment, and\r\nwhen he sees the manifest aversion of his Subjects to admit of such a\r\nchange, undertake a work of so much difficulty, destructive to the\r\nMonarchy, and ruinous to Himself, if it succeeded not; and if it\r\nsucceeded, not capable of making him so truly Great as he is by Law\r\nalready. If we add to this, his Majesties natural love to Peace and\r\nQuiet, which increases in every man with his years, this ridiculous\r\nsupposition will vanish of itself; which is sufficiently exploded by\r\ndaily experiments to the contrary. For let the Reign of any of our Kings\r\nbe impartially examin'd, and there will be found in none of them so many\r\nexamples of Moderation, and keeping close to the Government by Law, as\r\nin his. And instead of swelling the Regal power to a greater height, we\r\nshall here find many gracious priviledges accorded to the Subjects,\r\nwithout any one advancement of Prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe next thing material in the Letter, _is the questioning the legality\r\nof the Declaration; which the Author sayes by the new style of_ his\r\nMajesty in Council, _is order'd to be read in all Churches and Chappels\r\nthroughout_ England, _And which no doubt the blind obedience of our\r\nClergy, will see carefully perform'd; yet if it be true, that there is\r\nno Seal, nor Order of Council, but only the Clerks hand to it, they may\r\nbe call'd in question as publishers of false news, and invectives\r\nagainst a third Estate of the Kingdom_.\r\n\r\nSince he writes this only upon a supposition, it will be time enough to\r\nanswer it, when the supposition is made manifest in all its parts: In\r\nthe meantime, let him give me leave to suppose too, that in case it be\r\ntrue that there be no Seal, yet since it is no Proclamation, but only a\r\nbare Declaration of his Majesty, to inform and satisfie his Subjects, of\r\nthe reasons which induc'd him to dissolve the two last Parliaments, a\r\nSeal in this case, is not of absolute necessity: for the King speaks not\r\nhere as commanding any thing, but the Printing, publishing and reading.\r\nAnd 'tis not denyed the meanest Englishman, to vindicate himself in\r\nPrint, when he has any aspersion cast upon him. This is manifestly the\r\ncase, that the Enemies of the Government, had endeavour'd to insinuate\r\ninto the People such Principles, as this Answerer now publishes: and\r\ntherefore his Majesty, who is always tender to preserve the affections\r\nof his Subjects, desir'd to lay before them the necessary reasons, which\r\ninduc'd him to so unpleasant a thing, as the parting with two successive\r\nParliaments. And if the Clergy obey him in so just a Design, is this to\r\nbe nam'd a blind Obedience! But I wonder why our Author is so eager for\r\nthe calling them to account as Accessaries to an Invective against a\r\nthird Estate of the Kingdom, while he himself is guilty in almost every\r\nsentence of his discourse of aspersing the King, even in his own Person,\r\nwith all the Virulency and Gall imaginable. It appears plainly that an\r\nHouse of Commons, is that _Leviathan_ which he Adores: that is his\r\nSovereign in effect, and a third Estate is not only greater than the\r\nother two, but than him who is presiding over the three.\r\n\r\nBut, though our Author cannot get his own Seditious Pamphlet to be read\r\nin Churches and in Chappels, I dare secure you, he introduces it into\r\nConventicles, and Coffee-houses of his Faction: besides, his sending it\r\nin Post Letters, to infect the Populace of every County. 'Tis enough,\r\nthat this Declaration is evidently the Kings, and the only true\r\nexception, which our Answerer has to it, is that he would deny his\r\nMajesty the power of clearing his intentions to the People: and finds\r\nhimself aggriev'd, that his King should satisfie them in spight of\r\nhimself and of his party.\r\n\r\nThe next Paragraph is wholly spent, in giving us to understand, that a\r\nKing, of _England_ is no other thing than a Duke of _Venice_; take the\r\nParallell all along: and you will find it true by only changing of the\r\nnames. A Duke of _Venice_ can do no wrong; in Senate he can make no ill\r\nLaws; in Council no ill Orders, in the Treasury can dispose of no\r\nMoney, but wisely, and for the interest of the Government, and according\r\nto such proportions as are every way requisite: if otherwise all\r\nOfficers are answerable, &c. Which is in effect, to say he can neither\r\ndo wrong nor right, nor indeed any thing, _quatenus_ a King. This puts\r\nme in mind of _Sancho Panca_ in his Government of the Island of\r\n_Barataria_, when he was dispos'd to eat or drink, his Physitian stood\r\nup for the People, and snatch'd the dish from him in their right,\r\nbecause he was a publick person, and therefore the Nation must be Judges\r\nto a dram and scruple what was necessary for the sustenance of the Head\r\nof the Body politique. Oh, but there is a wicked thing call'd the\r\nMilitia in their way, and they shew'd they had a moneths mind to it, at\r\nthe first breaking out of the Popish Plot. If they could once persuade\r\nhis Majesty, to part graciously with that trifle, and with his power of\r\nmaking War and Peace; and farther, to resign all Offices of Trust, to be\r\ndispos'd by their nomination, their Argument would be an hundred times\r\nmore clear: for then it would be evident to all the World, that he could\r\ndo nothing. But if they can work him to part with none of these, then\r\nthey must content themselves to carry on their new Design beyond Seas:\r\neither of ingaging the _French_ King to fall upon _Flanders_, or\r\nencouraging the States General to lay aside, or privately to cut off the\r\nPrince of _Orange_, or getting a War declared against _England_ and\r\n_France_ conjoyntly: for by that means, either the King can be but a\r\nweak Enemy, and as they will manage matters, he shall be kept so bare of\r\nMoney, that Twelve _Holland_ Ships shall block up the River, or he shall\r\nbe forced to cast himself upon a House of Commons, and to take Money\r\nupon their Terms, which will sure be as easie, as those of an Usurer to\r\nan Heir in want. These are part of the projects now afoot: and how Loyal\r\nand conscionable they are, let all indifferent persons judge.\r\n\r\nIn the close of this Paragraph, he falls upon the King for appealing to\r\nthe People against their own Representatives. But I would ask him in the\r\nfirst place, if an Appeal be to be made, to whom can the King Appeal,\r\nbut to his People? And if he must justifie his own proceedings to their\r\nwhole Body, how can he do it but by blaming their Representatives? I\r\nbelieve every honest man is sorry, that any such Divisions have been\r\nbetwixt the King and his House of Commons. But since there have been,\r\nhow could the King complain more modestly, or in terms more expressing\r\nGrief, than Indignation? or what way is left him to obviate the causes\r\nof such complaints for the future, but this gentle admonishment for what\r\nis past?\r\n\r\n'Tis easily agreed, he says, (and here I joyn issue with him) _That\r\nthere were never more occasions for a Parliament, than were at the\r\nopening of the last, which was held at_ Westminster. But where he\r\nmaliciously adds, _never were our Liberties and Properties more in\r\ndanger, nor the Protestant Religion more expos'd to an utter extirpation\r\nboth at home and abroad_, he shuffles together Truth and Falshood: for\r\nfrom the greatness of _France_, the danger of the Protestant Religion is\r\nevident; But that our Liberty, Religion, and Property were in danger\r\nfrom the Government, let him produce the instances of it, that they may\r\nbe answer'd; what dangers there were and are from the Antimonarchical\r\nParty, is not my present business to enquire. As for the growing terrour\r\nof the _French_ Monarchy, the greater it is, the more need of supply to\r\nprovide against it.\r\n\r\n_The Ministers tell us in the Declaration, That they asked of that\r\nParliament the supporting the Alliances they had made for the\r\nPreservation of the general peace in Christendom, and had desir'd their\r\nadvice and assistance for the preservation of_ Tangier: _had recommended\r\nto them, the farther examination of the Plot; and that his Majesty had\r\noffer'd to concurr in any Remedies for the security of the Protestant\r\nReligion, which might consist with the preserving the Succession of the\r\nCrown, in its due and legal course of descent, but to all this they met\r\nwith most unsuitable returns._\r\n\r\nNow mark what the Gentleman infers, _That the Ministers well knew, that\r\ntheir demands of Money for the ends abovesaid, were not to be complyed\r\nwith, till his Majesty were pleas'd to change the hands and Councils by\r\nwhich his Affairs were managed_.--that is, nothing must be given but to\r\nsuch men in whom they could confide, as if neither the King, nor those\r\nwhom he employed were fit any longer to be Trusted. But the supream\r\npower, and the management of all things, must be wholly in their Party,\r\nas it was in _Watt Tyler_, and _Jack Cade_ of famous memory, when they\r\nhad got a King into their possession: for this Party, will never think\r\nhis Majesty their own, till they have him as safe, as they had his\r\nFather. But if they could compass their Designs, of bringing the same\r\nGentlemen into play once more, who some years since were at the Helm;\r\nlet me ask them, when the Affairs of the Nation were worse manag'd? who\r\ngave the rise to the present greatness of the _French_? or who counsel'd\r\nthe dissolution of the Tripple League? 'Tis a miracle to me that the\r\nPeople should think them good Patriots, only because they are out of\r\nhumour with the Court, and in disgrace. I suppose they are far other\r\nprinciples, than those of Anger and Revenge, which constitute an honest\r\nStatesman. But let men be what they will before, if they once espouse\r\ntheir Party, let them be touch'd with that Philosophers stone, and they\r\nare turn'd into Gold immediately. Nay, that will do more for them, than\r\nwas ever pretended to by Chymistry; for it will raise up the shape of a\r\nworthy Patriot, from the ashes of a Knave. 'Tis a pretty juggle to tell\r\nthe King they assist him with Money, when indeed they design only to\r\ngive it to themselves; that is, to their own Instruments, which is no\r\nmore, than to shift it from one hand into another. It will be a favour\r\nat the long run, if they condescend to acquaint the King, how they\r\nintend to lay out his Treasure. But our Author very roundly tells his\r\nMajesty, _That at present they will give him no supplyes, because they\r\nwould be employ'd, to the destruction of his Person, and of the\r\nProtestant Religion, and the inslaving the whole Nation_, to which I\r\nwill only add, that of all these matters next and immediately under God,\r\nhe and his Party, constitute themselves the supream Judges.\r\n\r\n_The Duke of_ York, _the Queen, and the two French Dutchesses are the\r\ngreat support and protectors of the Popish interest in these Kingdoms_.\r\n\r\nHow comes it to pass that our Author shuffles the two French Dutchesses\r\ntogether? of which the one is an _Italian_, the other a _French_ Woman,\r\nand an _English_ Dutchess? Is he grown so purblind, that he cannot\r\ndistinguish Friends from Foes? Has he so soon forgotten the memory of\r\npast benefits, that he will not consider one of them as her, to whom all\r\ntheir applications were so lately made? Is she so quickly become an old\r\nacquaintance, that none of the politick assignations at her Lodgings are\r\nremembred? After this, who will trust the gratitude of a Common-wealth?\r\nor who will blame the Conduct of a silly Court, for being over-reach'd\r\nby the whole _French_ Council, when the able part of the Nation, the\r\ndesigning heads, the gray wisdom, and the Beaux Garcons, are all foil'd\r\nby a single _French_ Woman, at their own Weapon, dissimulation? for the\r\nother _French_ Dutchess, since I perceive our Author is unacquainted\r\nwith her Character, I will give it him; she is one who loves her ease to\r\nthat degree, that no advantages of Fortune can bribe her into business.\r\nLet her but have wherewithall to make Merry adays, and to play at Cards\r\nanights, and I dare answer for her, that she will take as little care to\r\ndisturb their business, as she takes in the management of her own. But\r\nif you will say that she only affects idleness, and is a grand Intriguer\r\nin her heart, I will only Answer, that I should shew you just such\r\nanother as I have describ'd her Grace, amongst the heads of your own\r\nParty: indeed I do not say it is a Woman, but 'tis one who loves a\r\nWoman.\r\n\r\nAs for the Dutchess of _M._ either she is a very sincere lover of\r\ndownright idleness, or she has cousen'd all parts of Christendom, where\r\nshe has wandred for these last Ten years. I hope our solid Author will\r\npardon me this digression; but now we have had our dance, let us to our\r\nserious business.\r\n\r\n_While these, and their Creatures are at the Helm, what can we expect\r\nfor the security of the Protestant Religion, or what opposition to the\r\nambitious designs of_ France?\r\n\r\nI suppose more reasonably on the other side, that no such persons are at\r\nthe Helm, and that what he has assum'd is but precarious. But I retort\r\nupon him, that if some of his Party were the Ministers, the Protestant\r\nReligion would receive but very cold assistance from them, who have none\r\nat all themselves. And for the growth of the _French_ Monarchy, I have\r\nalready told you, to whose Counsels we are beholden for it.\r\n\r\n_He goes on; you will tell me that the supplyes so given may be\r\nappropriated, to these particular ends of supporting our Alliances, and\r\nthe relief of_ Tangier: _And it may be so limited by Act of Parliament,\r\nthat it cannot be diverted to other uses. But he answers that Objection\r\nby a Story of_ Monsieur de Sully's _telling of_ H. 4th _of_ France: _let\r\nthe States raise the Money, and tye it as they please; when they are\r\ndissolved, you may dispose of it as you please_.\r\n\r\nAll this is to confirm his first unalterable principle, that the King\r\nmust be sure to finger nothing; but be us'd as Fishers do their\r\nCormorant, have his mouth left open, to swallow the prey for them, but\r\nhis throat gagg'd that nothing may go down. Let them bring this to pass,\r\nand afterwards they will not need to take away his Prerogative of making\r\nWar: He must do that at his own peril, and be sent to fight his Enemies\r\nwith his hands bound behind him. But what if he thinks not their Party\r\nfit to be intrusted, least they should employ it against his Person? why\r\nthen, as he told you _they will give him nothing_. Now whose will be the\r\nfault in common reason, if the Allyances be not supported, and _Tangier_\r\nnot relieved? If they will give him nothing, before they bring him to a\r\nnecessity of taking it upon their terms, asmuch as in them lyes they\r\ndissolve the Government: and the Interest of the Nation abroad must be\r\nleft in the Suds, till they have destroy'd the Monarchy at home. But\r\nsince God, and the Laws have put the disposing of the Treasury into his\r\nMajesties hands, it may satisfie any reasonable _Englishman_, that the\r\nsame Laws have provided for the mispending of the Treasury, by calling\r\nthe publick Officers into question for it before the Parliament. For God\r\nbe thanked we have a House of Commons, who will be sure, never to forgoe\r\nthe least tittle of their Priviledges, and not be so meal-mouth'd as the\r\nStates of _France_, of whom neither Monsieur _Sully_, nor any of his\r\nSuccessors, have never had any cause of apprehension. But since the\r\nwisdom of our Ancestors have thought this Provision sufficient for our\r\nsecurity, What has his present Majesty deserv'd from his Subjects, that\r\nhe should be made a Minor at no less than fifty years of age? or that\r\nhis House of Commons should Fetter him beyond any of his Predecessors?\r\n_where the Interest goes, you will say, there goes the power_. But the\r\nmost ingenious of your Authors, I mean _Plato Redivivus,_ broaches no\r\nsuch principle as that you should force this Prerogative from the King,\r\nby undue courses. The best use which can be made of all, is rather to\r\nsupport the Monarchy, than to have it fall upon your Heads. If indeed\r\nthere were any reasonable fear of an Arbitrary Government, the adverse\r\nParty had somewhat to alledge in their defence of not supplying it; but\r\nit is not only evident, that the Kings temper is wholly averse from any\r\nsuch Design, but also demonstrable, that if all his Council, were such\r\nas this man most falsely suggests them to be, yet the notion of an\r\nabsolute power in the Prince is wholly impracticable, not only in this\r\nAge, but for ought any wise man can foresee, at any time hereafter. 'Tis\r\nplain, that the King has reduc'd himself already to live more like a\r\nprivate Gentleman than a Prince; and since he can content himself in\r\nthat condition, 'tis as plain, that the supplies which he demands are\r\nonly for the service of the publick, and not for his own maintenance.\r\nMonsieur _de Sully_ might give what Council he thought convenient for\r\n_Henry_ the Fourth, who was then designing that Arbitrary power, which\r\nhis Successors have since compass'd, to the ruine of the Subjects\r\nliberty in _France_; but I appeal to the Consciences of those men, who\r\nare most averse to the present Government, if they think our King would\r\nput his Peace and Quiet at this time of day, upon so desperate an issue.\r\nWhat the necessities, which they are driving him into, may make him part\r\nwith on the other hand, I know not. But how can they answer it to our\r\nPosterity, that for private Picques, self Interest, and causeless\r\njealousies, they would destroy the foundation of so excellent a\r\nGovernment, which is the admiration and envy of all _Europe_?\r\n\r\n_The rest of my Authors Paragraph, is only laying more load upon the\r\nMinisters, and telling us, that if a sum of Money sufficient for those\r\nends were given, while they were Managers of Affairs, it would be only\r\nto set them free from any apprehensions of account to any future\r\nParliament_. But this Argument having only the imaginary fear of an\r\nArbitrary power for its foundation, is already answer'd, he adds in the\r\nclose of it, _That the Prince has a cheap bargain, who gives Paper-Laws\r\nin exchange of Money and Power. Bargains, he tells us, there have always\r\nbeen, and always will be, betwixt Prince and People, because it is in\r\nthe Constitution of our Goverment, and the chief dependance of our Kings\r\nis in the love and liberality of their People_.\r\n\r\nOur present King, I acknowledge has often found it so; though no thanks\r\nI suppose to this Gentleman and his Party. But though he cry down Paper\r\nand Parchment at this Rate, they are the best Evidence he can have for\r\nhis Estate, and his friends the Lawyers will advise him to speak with\r\nless contempt of those Commodities. If Laws avail the Subject nothing,\r\nour Ancestors have made many a bad Bargain for us. Yet I can instance to\r\nhim one Paper, namely, that of the _Habeas Corpus_ bill; for which the\r\nHouse of Commons would have been content to have given a Million of good\r\n_English_ money, and which they had Gratis from his Majesty. 'Tis true,\r\nthey boast they got it by a Trick; but if the Clerk of the Parliament\r\nhad been bidden to forget it, their Trick of telling Noses might have\r\nfail'd them. Therefore let us do right on all sides: The Nation is\r\noblig'd both to the House of Commons for asking it, and more especially\r\nto his Majesty, for granting it so freely.\r\n\r\n_But what can we think of his next Axiome, that it was never known that\r\nLaws signified any thing to a People, who had not the sole guard of\r\ntheir own Prince, Government and Laws?_\r\n\r\nHere all our Fore-fathers are Arraign'd at once for trusting the\r\nExecutive power of the Laws in their Princes hands. And yet you see the\r\nGovernment has made a shift to shuffle on for so many hundred years\r\ntogether, under this miserable oppression; and no man so wise in so many\r\nages to find out, that _Magna Charta_ was to no purpose, while there was\r\na King. I confess in Countreys, where the Monarck governs absolutely,\r\nand the Law is either his Will, or depending on it, this noble maxim\r\nmight take place; But since we are neither _Turks_, _Russians_, nor\r\n_Frenchmen_, to affirm that in our Countrey, in a Monarchy of so\r\ntemperate and wholsom a Constitution, Laws are of no validity, because\r\nthey are not in the disposition of the People, plainly infers that no\r\nGovernment but that of a Common-wealth can preserve our Liberties and\r\nPriviledges: for though the Title of a Prince be allow'd to continue,\r\nyet if the People must have the sole guard and Government of him and of\r\nthe Laws, 'tis but facing an whole hand of Trumps, with an insignificant\r\nKing of another sute. And which is worst of all, if this be true, there\r\ncan be no Rebellion, for then the People is the supream power. And if\r\nthe Representatives of the Commons shall Jarr with the other two\r\nEstates, and with the King, it would be no Rebellion to adhere to them in\r\nthat War: to which I know that every Republican who reads this, must of\r\nnecessity Answer, _No more it would not_. Then farewell the Good Act of\r\nParliament, which makes it Treason to Levy Arms against the present King,\r\nupon any pretences whatsoever. For if this be a Right of Nature, and\r\nconsequently never to be Resign'd, there never has been, nor ever can be\r\nany pact betwixt King and People, and Mr. _Hobbs_ would tell us, _That we\r\nare still in a state of War_.\r\n\r\n_The next thing our Author would establish, is, That there is nothing in\r\nNature or in Story so ridiculous, as the management of the Ministers, in\r\nthe Examination of the Popish Plot. Which being prov'd by_ Coleman's\r\n_and others Letters, and by both Houses by declaring the King's Life to\r\nbe in danger_, &c. _Yet they have persuaded the King to believe nothing\r\nof this danger; but to apprehend the Plot to be extreamly improv'd, if\r\nnot wholly contriv'd by the Presbyterians. And to think it more his\r\nconcernment to have an end of all; then to have it search'd to the\r\nbottom: and that this was the true reason, why four Parliaments, during\r\nthe Examination of the Plot have been dissolv'd:_\r\n\r\nReasonable People will conclude, that his Majesty and his Ministers have\r\nproceeded, not ridiculously, but with all that caution which became\r\nthem. For in the first heat and vehemence of the Plot, the Avenues of\r\n_White-Hall_ were more strictly Guarded: His Majesty abstaining from\r\nPlaces of publick Entertainment, and the Ministers taking all necessary\r\nCare in Council, both to discover Conspiracies and to prevent them. So,\r\nthat simply considered, the Popish Plot has nothing to do with the\r\nDissolution of Four Parliaments. But the Use which has been made of it by\r\nthe House of Commons to Dis-inherit the Duke, to deny the King\r\nSupplies, and to make some Votes, which the King declares to be\r\nillegal, are the real and plain occasions of dissolving those\r\nParliaments. 'Tis only affirm'd, but never will be prov'd by this\r\nAuthor, that the King or his Ministers have ever been desirous to stifle\r\nthe Plot, and not to have it search'd into the bottom. For to what end\r\nhas his Majesty so often offer'd the Popish Lords to be brought to their\r\nTrial, but that their innocence or guilt, and consequently, that of the\r\nwhole party might be made manifest? Or why, after the execution of the\r\nLord _Stafford_, did the House of Commons stop at the other Lords, and\r\nnot proceed to try them in their turns? Did his Majesty stifle the Plot\r\nwhen he offered them, or did they refuse to sound the depth of it, when\r\nthey would not touch upon them? If it were for want of Witnesses, which\r\nis all that can be said, the case is deplorable on the part of the\r\naccused; who can neither be bail'd, because impeach'd in Parliament, nor\r\nadmitted to be tryed, for fear they should be acquitted for want of\r\nevidence. I do not doubt but his Majesty, after having done what in him\r\nlies for the utmost discovery of the Plot, both by frequent\r\nProclamations of Indemnity, and Reward, to such as would come in, and\r\ndiscover more, and by several others too long to repeat, is desirous\r\n(for what good man is not?) that his care and trouble might be over. But\r\nI am much deceiv'd, if the Antimonarchical Party be of the same\r\nopinion; or that they desire the Plot should be either wholly\r\ndiscover'd, or fully ended. For 'tis evidently their Interest to keep it\r\non foot, as long as possibly they can; and to give it hot water, as\r\noften as 'tis dying; for while they are in possession of this Jewel,\r\nthey make themselves masters of the people. For this very reason I have\r\noften said, even from the beginning of the Discovery, that the\r\nPresbyterians would never let it go out of their hands, but manage it to\r\nthe last inch upon a Save-all. And that if ever they had tryed one Lord,\r\nthey would value themselves upon that Conquest, as long as ever it would\r\nlast with the Populace: but whatever came on't, be sure to leave a Nest\r\nEgg in the _Tower_: And since I doubt not, but what so mean a Judge as I\r\nam could so easily discover, could not possibly escape the vigilancy of\r\nthose who are at the Helm; I am apt to think, that his Majesty saw at\r\nleast as great a danger arising to him from the discontented spirits of\r\nthe popular Faction, as from the Papists. For is it not plain, that ever\r\nsince the beginning of the Plot, they have been lopping off from the\r\nCrown whatever part of the Prerogative they could reach? and incroaching\r\ninto Soveraignty and Arbitrary Power themselves, while they seem'd to\r\nfear it from the King? How then could his Majesty be blam'd, if he were\r\nforc'd to dissolve those Parliaments, which instead of giving him\r\nrelief, made their Advantages upon his Distresses; and while they\r\npretended a care of his Person on the one hand, were plucking at his\r\nScepter with the other?\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Pamphleteer gives us a long Bead-roll of _Dangerfield's_\r\nPlot, Captain _Ely_, young _Tongue_, _Fitz-Gerard_ and Mr. _Ray_, rails\r\nat some, and commends others as far as his skill in Hyperbole will carry\r\nhim. Which all put together, amounts to no more than only this, that he\r\nwhom they called Rogue before, when he comes into their party, pays his\r\nGarnish, and is adopted into the name of an honest man. Thus _Ray_ was\r\nno Villain, when he accus'd Colonel _Sackvile_, before the House of\r\nCommons; but when he failed of the reward of godliness at their hands,\r\nand from a Wig became a tearing Tory in new Cloaths, our Author puts him\r\nupon the File of Rogues, with this brand, _Than whom a more notorious\r\nand known Villian lives not_.\r\n\r\nThe next thing be falls upon, is the Succession: which the King\r\ndeclares, _He will have preserved in its due descent_. Now our Author\r\ndespairing, it seems, that an Exclusion should pass by Bill, urges,\r\n_That the Right of Nature and Nations will impower Subjects to deliver a\r\nProtestant Kingdom from a Popish King_. The Law of Nations, is so\r\nundoubtedly, against him, that I am sure he dares not stick to that\r\nPlea: but will be forc'd to reply, that the Civil Law was made in favour\r\nof Monarchy: why then did he appeal to it? And for the Law of Nature, I\r\nknow not what it has to do with Protestants or Papists, except he can\r\nprove that the English Nation is naturally Protestant; and then I would\r\nenquire of him what Countrymen our Fore-fathers were? But if he means by\r\nthe Law of Nature, self-preservation and defence; even that neither will\r\nlook but a squint upon Religion; for a man of any Religion, and a man of\r\nno Religion, are equally bound to preserve their lives. But I answer\r\npositively to what he would be at; that the Law of self-preservation\r\nimpowers not a Subject to rise in Arms against his Soveraign, of another\r\nReligion, upon supposition of what he may do in his prejudice hereafter:\r\nfor, since it is impossible that a moral certainty should be made out of\r\na future contingency, and consequently, that the Soveraign may not\r\nextend his Power to the prejudice of any mans Liberty or Religion: The\r\nprobability (which is the worst that they can put it) is not enough to\r\nabsolve a Subject who rises in Arms, from Rebellion, _in foro\r\nConscientiae_. We read of a divine Command to obey Superior Powers: and\r\nthe Duke will lawfully be such, no Bill of Exclusion having past against\r\nhim in his Brother's life: Besides this, we have the Examples of\r\nPrimitive Christians, even under Heathen Emperors, always suffering, yet\r\nnever taking up Arms, during ten Persecutions. But we have no Text, no\r\nPrimitive Example encouraging us to rebel against a Christian Prince,\r\ntho of a different Perswasion. And to say there were then no Christian\r\nPrinces when the New Testament was written, will avail our Author\r\nlittle; for the Argument is a _Fortiori_: if it be unlawful to rebel\r\nagainst a Heathen Emperor, then much more against a Christian King. The\r\nCorollary is this, and every unbiassed sober man will subscribe to it,\r\nthat since we cannot pry into the secret Decrees of God, for the\r\nknowledge of future Events, we ought to rely upon his Providence, for\r\nthe Succession; without either plunging our present King into\r\nnecessities, for what may never happen; or refusing our obedience to one\r\nhereafter, who in the course of nature may succeed him. One, who if he\r\nhad the will, could never have the power to settle Popery in _England_,\r\nor to bring in Arbitrary Government.\r\n\r\n_But the Monarchy will not be destroyed, and the Protestant Religion\r\nwill be preserved, if we may have a Protestant Successor_.\r\n\r\nIf his party had thought, that this had been a true Expedient, I am\r\nconfident it had been mentioned in the last Parliament at _Westminster_.\r\nBut there, _altum silentium_ not one word of it. Was it because the\r\nMachine was not then in readiness to move! and that the Exclusion must\r\nfirst pass? or more truly was it ever intended to be urged? I am not\r\nashamed to say, that I particularly honour the Duke of _Monmouth_: but\r\nwhether his nomination to succeed, would, at the bottom be pleasing to\r\nthe Heads of his Cabal, I somewhat doubt. To keep him fast to them by\r\nsome remote hopes of it, may be no ill Policy. To have him in a\r\nreadiness to head an Army, in case it should please God the King should\r\ndie before the Duke, is the design; and then perhaps he has reason to\r\nexpect more from a Chance Game, than from the real desires of his party\r\nto exalt him to a Throne. But 'tis neither to be imagined, that a Prince\r\nof his Spirit, after the gaining of a Crown, would be managed by those\r\nwho helped him to it, let his ingagements and promises be never so\r\nstrong before, neither that he would be confin'd in the narrow compass\r\nof a Curtail'd Mungril Monarchy, half Common-wealth. Conquerors are not\r\neasily to be curbed. And it is yet harder to conceive, that his\r\npretended Friends, even design him so much as that. At present, 'tis\r\ntrue, their mutual necessities keep them fast together; and all the\r\nseveral Fanatick Books fall in, to enlarge the common stream: But\r\nsuppose the business compassed, as they design'd it, how many, and how\r\ncontradicting Interests are there to be satisfied! Every Sect of High\r\nShooes would then be uppermost; and not one of them endure the\r\ntoleration of another. And amongst them all, what will become of those\r\nfine Speculative Wits, who drew the Plan of this new Government, and who\r\noverthrew the old? For their comfort, the Saints will then account them\r\nAtheists, and discard them. Or they will plead each of them their\r\nparticular Merits, till they quarrel about the Dividend. And, the\r\nProtestant Successor himself, if he be not wholly governed by the\r\nprevailing party, will first be declared no Protestant; and next, no\r\nSuccessor. This is dealing sincerely with him, which _Plato Redivivus_\r\ndoes not: for all the bustle he makes concerning the Duke of _M._\r\nproceeds from a Commonwealth Principle: he is afraid at the bottom to\r\nhave him at the Head of the party, lest he should turn the absolute\r\nRepublick, now designing, into an arbitrary Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe next thing he exposes, is the project communicated at _Oxford_, by a\r\nworthy Gentleman since deceased. But since he avowed himself, that it\r\nwas but a rough draught, our Author might have paid more respect to his\r\nmemory, than to endeavour to render it ridiculous. But let us see how he\r\nmends the matter in his own which follows.\r\n\r\n_If the Duke were only banished, during life, and the Administration put\r\ninto the hands of Protestants, that would establish an unnatural War of\r\nExpediency, against an avowed Right and Title. But on the other hand\r\nexclude the Duke, and all other Popish Successors, and put down all\r\nthose Guards are now so illegally kept up, and banish the Papists, where\r\ncan be the danger of a War, in a Nation unanimous_?\r\n\r\nI will not be unreasonable with him; I will expect English no where from\r\nthe barrenness of his Country: but if he can make sense of his\r\n_Unnatural War of Expediency_, I will forgive him two false Grammars,\r\nand three Barbarisms, in every Period of his Pamphlet; and yet leave him\r\nenow of each to expose his ignorance, whensoever I design it. But his\r\nExpedient it self is very solid, if you mark it. _Exclude the Duke, take\r\naway the Guards_, and consequently, all manner of defence from the Kings\r\nPerson; _Banish every Mothers Son of the Papists, whether guilty or not\r\nguilty in particular of the Plot_. And when Papists are to be banished,\r\nI warrant you all Protestants in Masquerade must go for company; and\r\nwhen none but a pack of Sectaries and Commonwealths-men are left in\r\n_England_, where indeed will be the danger of a War, in a Nation\r\nunanimous? After this, why does not some resenting Friend of _Marvel_'s,\r\nput up a Petition to the Soveraigns of his party, that his Pension of\r\nfour hundred pounds _per annum_, may be transferred to some one amongst\r\nthem, who will not so notoriously betray their cause by dullness and\r\ninsufficiency? As for the illegal Guards, let the Law help them; or let\r\nthem be disbanded; for I do not think they have need of any Champion.\r\n\r\nThe next twenty Lines are only an illustration upon his Expedient: for\r\nhe is so fond of his darling Notion, that he huggs it to death, as the\r\nApe did her young one. He gives us his Bill of Tautology once more; for\r\nhe threatens, that they would not rest at the Exclusion; but the Papists\r\nmust again be banish'd, and the Dukes Creatures put out of Office both\r\nCivil and Military. Now the Dukes Creatures, I hope, are Papists, or\r\nlittle better; so that this is all the same: as if he had been conning\r\nover this ingenious Epigram;\r\n\r\n    There was a man who with great labour, and much pain;\r\n    Did break his neck, and break his neck, and break his neck again.\r\n\r\nAt the last, to shew his hand is not out in the whole Paragraph, when\r\nthe Duke is excluded, his Creatures put out of Office, the Papists\r\nbanished twice over; and the Church of _England_-men delivered to Satan,\r\nyet still he says the Duke is the great Minister of State; and the Kings\r\nExcellent Qualities give his Brother still opportunities to ruine us and\r\nour Religion. Even excluded, and without Friends and Faction he can do\r\nall this; and the King is endued with most excellent Qualities to suffer\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHaving found my man, methinks I can scarce afford to be serious with him\r\nany longer; but to treat him as he deserves, like an ill Bouffoon.\r\n\r\n_He defends the sharpess of the Addresses of which his Majesty\r\ncomplains_: but I suppose it would be better for him, and me, to let our\r\nPrincipals engage, and to stand by ourselves. I confess, I have heard\r\nsome members of that House, wish, that all Proceedings had been carried\r\nwith less vehemence. But my Author goes further on the other hand; _He\r\naffirms, that many wise and good men thought they had gone too far, in\r\nassuring, nay, in mentioning of money before our safety was fully\r\nprovided for_. So you see he is still for laying his hand upon the\r\npenny. In the mean time I have him in a Praemunire for arraigning the\r\nHouse of Commons; for he has tacitely confessed, that the wise and good\r\nmen were the fewer; because the House carryed it for mentioning money in\r\ntheir Address. But it seems they went too far, in speaking of a Supply,\r\nbefore they had consulted this Gentleman, how far the safety of the\r\nNation would admit it. I find plainly by his temper, that if matters had\r\ncome to an accommodation, and a bargain had been a bargain, the Knights\r\nof the Shire must have been the Protestant Knights no longer.\r\n\r\n_As for Arbitrary Power of taking men into custody, for matters that had\r\nno relation to Privileges of Parliament, he says they have erred with\r\ntheir Fathers._ If he confess that they have erred, let it be with all\r\ntheir Generation, still they have erred: and an error of the first\r\ndigestion, is seldom mended in the second. But I find him modest in this\r\npoint; and knowing too well they are not a Court of Judicature, he does\r\nnot defend them from Arbitrary Proceedings, but only excuses, and\r\npalliates the matter, by saying, that it concern'd the Rights of the\r\nPeople, in suppressing their Petitions to the Fountain of Justice. So,\r\nwhen it makes for him, he can allow the King to be the _Fountain of\r\nJustice_, but at other times he is only a _Cistern of the People._ But\r\nhe knows sufficiently, however he dissembles it, that there were some\r\ntaken into custody, to whom that crime was not objected. Yet since in a\r\nmanner he yields up the Cause, I will not press him too far, where he is\r\nso manifestly weak. Tho I must tell him by the way, that he is as justly\r\nto be proceeded against for calling the Kings Proclamation illegal,\r\nwhich concerned the matter of Petitioning, as some of those, who had\r\npronounced against them by the House of Commons, that terrible sentence,\r\nof _Take him,_ Topham.\r\n\r\n_The strange illegal Votes declaring several eminent persons to be\r\nEnemies to the King and Kingdom, are not so strange, he says, but very\r\njustifiable_. I hope he does not mean, that illegal Votes are now not\r\nstrange in the House of Commons: But observe the reason which he gives:\r\nfor the House of Commons had before address'd for their removal from\r\nabout the King. It was his business to have prov'd, that an Address of\r\nthe House of Commons, without Process, order of Law, hearing any\r\nDefence, or offering any proof against them is sufficient ground to\r\nremove any person from the King: But instead of this he only proves,\r\nthat former Addresses have been made, _Which no body can deny_. When he\r\nhas throughly settled this important point, that Addresses have\r\ncertainly been made, instead of an Argument to back it, he only thinks,\r\nthat one may affirm by Law, _That the King ought to have no person about\r\nhim, who has the misfortune of such a Vote_. But this is too ridiculous\r\nto require an Answer. They who will have a thing done, and give no\r\nreason for it, assume to themselves a manifest Arbitrary Power. Now this\r\nPower cannot be in the Representatives, if it be not in the People: or if\r\nit be in them, the People is absolute. But since he wholly thinks it,\r\nlet him injoy the privilege of every Free Born Subject, to have the Bell\r\nclinck to him what he imagines.\r\n\r\nWell; all this while he has been in pain about laying his Egg: at the\r\nlast we shall have him cackle.\r\n\r\n_If the House of Commons declare they have just Reasons to fear, that\r\nsuch a person puts the King upon Arbitrary Councils, or betrays His and\r\nthe Nations Interest, in such a Case, Order and Process of Law is not\r\nnecessary to remove him; but the Opinion and Advice of the Nation is\r\nenough; because bare removing neither fines him, nor deprives him of\r\nLife, Liberty, or Offices, wherein State Affairs are not concern'd._\r\n\r\nHitherto, he has only prov'd, according to his usual Logick, that bare\r\nremoving, is but bare removing, and that to deprive a man of a Publick\r\nOffice is not so much as it would be to hang him: all that possibly can\r\nbe infer'd from this Argument, is only that a Vote may do a less wrong,\r\nbut not a greater. Let us see how be proceeds.\r\n\r\n_If he be not remov'd upon such Address, you allow him time to act his\r\nVillany; and the Nation runs the hazard_.\r\n\r\nI answer, if the House have just Reasons on their side, 'tis but\r\nequitable they should declare them; for an Address in this Case is an\r\nAppeal to the King against such a man: and no Appeal is supposed to be\r\nwithout the Causes which induc'd it. But when they ask a Removal, and\r\ngive no reason for it; they make themselves Judges of the Matter, and\r\nconsequently they appeal not, but command. If they please to give their\r\nReasons, they justifie their Complaint; for then their Address is almost\r\nin the nature of an Impeachment; and in that Case they may procure a\r\nhearing when they please. But barely to declare, that they suspect any\r\nman, without charging him with particular Articles, is almost to\r\nconfess, they can find none against him. To suppose a man has time to\r\nact his Villanies, must suppose him first to be a Villain: and if they\r\nsuspect him to be such, nothing more easie than to name his Crimes, and\r\nto take from him all opportunities of future mischief. But at this rate\r\nof bare addressing, any one who has a publick profitable Employment\r\nmight be remov'd; for upon the private Picque of a Member he may have a\r\nparty rais'd for an Address against him. And if his Majesty can no\r\nsooner reward the Services of any one who is not of their party, but\r\nthey can vote him out of his Employment; it must at last follow, that\r\nnone but their own party must be employ'd, and then a Vote of the House\r\nof Commons, is in effect the Government. Neither can that be call'd the\r\nAdvice and Opinion of the whole Nation, by my Author's favour, where\r\nthe other two Estates, and the Soveraign are not consenting.\r\n\r\n_'Tis no matter_, says this Gentleman; _there are some things so\r\nreasonable, that they are above any written Law: and will in despite of\r\nany Power on Earth have their effect, whereof this is one_.\r\n\r\nI love a man who deals plainly; he explicitly owns this is not Law, and\r\nyet it is reasonable; and will have its effect as if it were. See then,\r\nin the first place the written Law is laid aside: that sence is thrown\r\nopen to admit reason in a larger denomination. Now that reason which is\r\nnot Law, must be either Enthusiasm, or the head-strong will of a whole\r\nNation combin'd: because in despite of any Earthly Power it will have\r\nits effect; so that, which way soever our Author takes it, he must mean\r\nFanaticism, or Rebellion: Law grounded on reason is resolv'd into the\r\nAbsolute Power of the People; and this is _Ratio ultima Reipublicae_.\r\n\r\nFurthermore; _The King is a publick Person: in his private capacity_,\r\nas we are told, _he can only eat and drink; and perform some other acts\r\nof nature which shall be nameless. But his actings without himself,_\r\nsays my grave Author, _are only as a King. In his politick capacity he\r\nought not to marry, love, hate, make war, or peace, but as a King; and\r\nagreeable to the People, and their Interest he governs._\r\n\r\nIn plain terms then, as he is a man he has nothing left to do: for the\r\nActions which are mention'd, are those only of an Animal, or which are\r\ncommon to Man and Beast. And as he is a King he has as little Business,\r\nfor there he is at the disposing of the People: and the only use that\r\ncan be made of such a Monarch, is for an Innkeeper to let upon a\r\nSign-Post to draw custom. But these Letters of Instruction how he should\r\nbehave himself in his Kingly Office, cannot but call to mind how he was\r\nschool'd and tutor'd, when the Covenanters made just such another Prince\r\nof him in _Scotland_. When the terrible fasting day was come, if he were\r\nsick in bed, no remedy, he must up and to Kirk; and that without a\r\nmouthful of Bread to stay his Stomach; for he fasted then in his\r\nPolitick Capacity. When he was seated, no looking aside from Mr. _John_;\r\nnot a whisper to any man, but was a disrespect to the Divine Ordinance.\r\nAfter the first Thunderer had spent his Lungs, no Retirement, the first\r\nis reinforc'd by a second and a third: all chosen Vessels, dieted for\r\nPreaching, and the best breath'd of the whole Country. When the Sun went\r\ndown, then up went the Candles, and the fourth arises to carry on the\r\nwork of the night, when that of the day was at an end.\r\n\r\n'Tis true what he says, that our greatest Princes have often hearkened\r\nto the Addresses of their People, and have remov'd some persons from\r\nthem; but it was when they found those Addresses reasonable themselves.\r\nBut they who consult the manner of Addresses in former times, will find\r\nthem to have been manag'd in the House of Commons, with all the calmness\r\nand circumspection imaginable. The Crimes were first maturely weigh'd,\r\nand the whole matter throughly winnow'd in Debates. After which, if they\r\nthought it necessary for the publick wellfare, that such a person should\r\nbe remov'd, they dutifully acquainted the King with their opinion, which\r\nwas often favourably heard; and their desires granted. But now the Case\r\nis quite otherwise; Either no Debate, or a very slight one precedes\r\nAddresses of that nature. But a man is run down with violent Harangues;\r\nand 'tis thought sufficient, if any member rises up, and offers that he\r\nwill make out the Accusation afterwards: when things are carried in this\r\nheady manner, I suppose 'tis no sign of a Great Prince, to have any of\r\nhis Servants forc'd from him. But such Addresses will insensibly grow\r\ninto Presidents: you see our Author is nibbling at one already. And we\r\nknow a House of Commons is always forgiving the Crescent in their Arms.\r\nIf they gain a point, they never recede from it, they make sure work of\r\nevery concession from the Crown, and immediately put it into the\r\nChristmass Box: from whence there is no Redemption.\r\n\r\nIn justification of the two Votes against lending or advancing Money to\r\nthe King, he falls to railing, like a Sophister in the Schools, when his\r\nSyllogisms are at an end. He arraigns the Kings private manner of\r\nliving, without considering that his not being supplied has forc'd him\r\nto it. I do not take upon me to defend any former ill management of the\r\nTreasury; but, if I am not deceiv'd, the great grievance of the other\r\nparty at present, is, that it is well manag'd. And, that notwithstanding\r\nnothing has been given for so many years, yet a competent provision is\r\nstill made for all expences of the publick, if not so large as might be\r\nwish'd, yet at least as much as is necessary. And I can tell my Author\r\nfor his farther mortification, that at present no money is furnish'd to\r\nhis Majesties Occasions, at such unconscionable Usury as he mentions. If\r\nhe would have the Tables set up again, let the King be put into a\r\ncondition, and then let eating and drinking flourish, according to the\r\nhearty, honest and greasie Hospitality of our Ancestors. He would have\r\nthe King have recourse to Parliaments, as the only proper Supply to a\r\nKing of _England_, for those things which the Treasury in this low Ebb\r\ncannot furnish out: but when he comes to the Conditions, on which this\r\nmoney is to be had, they are such, that perhaps forty in the Hundred to\r\na Jew Banquer were not more unreasonable. In the mean time, if a\r\nParliament will not give, and others must not lend, there is a certain\r\nstory of the Dog in the Manger, which out of good manners I will not\r\napply.\r\n\r\nThe Vote for not prosecuting Protestant Dissenters upon the Penal Laws;\r\nwhich at this time is thought to be a Grievance to the Subject, a\r\nweakning of the Protestant Religion, and an Incouragement to Popery, is\r\na matter more tenderly to be handled. But if it be true what has been\r\ncommonly reported since the Plot, that Priests, Jesuits, and Friars,\r\nmingle amongst Anabaptists, Quakers, and other Sectaries, and are their\r\nTeachers, must not they be prosecuted neither? Some men would think,\r\nthat before such an uniting of Protestants, a winnowing were not much\r\namiss; for after they were once sent together to the Mill, it would be\r\ntoo late to divide the Grist. His Majesty is well known to be an\r\nindulgent Prince, to the Consciences of his dissenting Subjects: But\r\nwhoever has seen a Paper call'd, I think, _An intended Bill for\r\nuniting_, &c. which lay upon the Table of every Coffee-House, and was\r\nmodelling to pass the House of Commons, may have found things of such\r\ndangerous concernment to the Government, as might seem not so much\r\nintended to unite Dissenters in a Protestant Church, as to draw together\r\nall the Forces of the several Fanatick Parties, against the Church of\r\n_England_. And when they were encouraged by such a Vote, which they\r\nvalue as a Law; (for so high that Coin is now inhaunc'd) perhaps it is\r\nnot unreasonable to hold the Rod over them. But for my own part, I\r\nheartily wish, that there may be no occasion for Christians to persecute\r\neach other. And since my Author speaks with some moderation, candor, and\r\nsubmission to his Mother Church, I shall only desire him and the\r\ndissenting Party, to make the use they ought, of the King Gracious\r\nDisposition to them, in not yet proceeding with all the violence which\r\nthe penal Laws require against them. But this calm of my Author, was too\r\nhappy to last long. You find him immediately transported into a storm\r\nabout the business of _Fitz-Harris_, which occasion'd the Dissolution of\r\nthe Parliament at _Oxford_: and accusing, according to his sawcy Custom,\r\nboth his Majesty, and the House of Lords, concerning it. As for the\r\nHouse of Lords, they have already vindicated their own right, by\r\nthrowing out the Impeachment: and sure the People of _England_ ought to\r\nown them as the Assertors of the publick Liberty in so doing; for\r\nProcess being before ordered against him at Common Law, and no\r\nparticular Crime being laid to his Charge by the House of Commons, if\r\nthey had admitted his Cause to be tryed before the Lordships, this would\r\nhave grown a President in time, that they must have been forc'd to judge\r\nall those whom the House of Commons would thrust upon them, till at last\r\nthe number of Impeachments would be so increas'd; that the Peers would\r\nhave no time for any other business of the Publick: and the Highest\r\nCourt of Judicature would have been reduc'd to be the Ministers of\r\nRevenge to the Commons. What then would become of our ancient Privilege\r\nto be tryed _per pares_? Which in process of time would be lost to us\r\nand our posterity: except a proviso were made on purpose, that this\r\njudgment might not be drawn into farther President; and that is never\r\ndone, but when there is a manifest necessity of breaking rules, which\r\nhere there was not. Otherwise the Commons may make Spaniels of the\r\nLords, throw them a man, and bid them go judge, as we command a Dog to\r\nfetch and carry. But neither the Lords Reasons, nor the King first\r\nhaving possession of the Prisoner, signifie any thing with our Author.\r\nHe will tell you the reason of the Impeachment was to bring out the\r\nPopish Plot. If _Fitz-Harris_ really know any thing but what relates to\r\nhis own Treason, he chuses a fine time of day to discover it now, when\r\n'tis manifestly to save his Neck, that he is forc'd to make himself a\r\ngreater Villain; and to charge himself with new Crimes to avoid the\r\npunishment of the old. Had he not the benefit of so many Proclamations,\r\nto have come in before, if he then knew any thing worth discovery? And\r\nwas not his fortune necessitous enough at all times, to catch at an\r\nimpunity, which was baited with Rewards to bribe him? 'tis not for\r\nnothing that Party has been all along so favourable to him: they are\r\nconscious to themselves of some other matters than a Popish Plot. Let\r\nhim first be tryed for what he was first accus'd: if he be acquitted,\r\nhis Party will be satisfied, and their strength increas'd by the known\r\nhonesty of another Evidence: but if he be condemn'd, let us see what\r\ntruth will come out of him, when he has _Tyburn_ and another World\r\nbefore his Eyes. Then, if he confess any thing which makes against the\r\nCause, their Excuse is ready; he died a Papist, and had a dispensation\r\nfrom the Pope to lie. But if they can bring him silent to the Gallows,\r\nall their favour will be, to wish him dispatch'd out of his pain, as\r\nsoon as possibly he may. And in that Case they have already promis'd\r\nthey will be good to his Wife, and provide for her, which would be a\r\nstrong encouragement, for many a woman, to perswade her Husband to\r\ndigest the Halter. This remembers me of a certain Spanish Duke, who\r\ncommanding a Sea-Port-Town, set an Officer of his, underhand to rob the\r\nMerchants. His Grace you may be confident was to have the Booty, and the\r\nFellow was assur'd if he were taken to be protected. It fell out, after\r\nsome time, that he was apprehended: His Master, according to Articles,\r\nbrought him off. The Rogue went again to his vocation, was the second\r\ntime taken, delivered again, and so the third. At last the matter grew\r\nso notorious, that the Duke found, it would be both scandalous and\r\ndifficult to protect him any longer; But the poor Malefactor sending his\r\nWife to tell him that if he did not save him he must be hanged to\r\nmorrow, and that he must confess who set him on: His Master very civilly\r\nsent him this Message; _Prithee suffer thy self to be hanged this once\r\nto do me a Courtesie, and it shall be the better for thy Wife and\r\nChildren._\r\n\r\n'But that which makes amends for all, says our Author, is the Kings\r\nresolution to have frequent Parliaments. Yet this, it seems, is no\r\namends neither: for he says Parliaments are like Terms, if there be Ten\r\nin a Year, and all so short to near no Causes, they do no good.'\r\n\r\nI say on the other hand, If the Courts will resolve beforehand to have\r\nno Causes brought before them, but one which they know they cannot\r\ndispatch; let the Terms be never so long, they make them as\r\ninsignificant as a Vacation.\r\n\r\n_The Kings Prerogative, when and where they should be call'd, and how\r\nlong they should sit, is but subservient, as our Friend tells us, to the\r\ngreat design of Government; and must be accommodated to it, or we are\r\neither denyed or deluded of that Protection and Justice we are born to._\r\n\r\nMy Author is the happiest in one faculty, I ever knew. He is still\r\nadvancing some new Position, which without proving, he slurs upon us for\r\nan Argument: though he knows, that Doctrines without proofs will edifie\r\nbut little. That the Kings Prerogative is subservient, or in order to\r\nthe ends of Government is granted him. But what strange kind of Argument\r\nis this, to prove that we are cheated of that Protection to which we are\r\nborn. Our Kings have always been indued with the power of calling\r\nParliaments, nominating the time, appointing of the Place, and\r\nDissolving them when they thought it for the publick good: And the\r\nPeople have wisely consulted their own welfare in it. Suppose, for\r\nexample, that there be a Jarring between the three Estates, which\r\nrenders their sitting at that time Impracticable; since none of them can\r\npretend to Judge the proceedings of the other two, the Judgment of the\r\nwhole must either reside in a Superiour power, or the discord must\r\nterminate in the ruine of them all. For if one of the three incroach too\r\nfar, there is so much lost in the Balance of the Estates, and so much\r\nmore Arbitrary power in one; 'Tis as certain in Politiques, as in\r\nNature; That where the Sea prevails the Land loses. If no such discord\r\nshould arise, my Authors Argument is of no farther use: for where the\r\nSoveraign and Parliament agree, there can be no deluding of the People;\r\nSo, that in short, his quarrel is to the constitution of the Government.\r\n\r\nAnd we see what nettles him, That the King has learnt from the unhappy\r\nexample of his Father, not to perpetuate a Parliament. But he will tell\r\nyou, that they desire only a lasting Parliament, which may dispatch all\r\ncauses necessary and proper for the publick: And I Answer him, that it\r\nlyes in themselves to make it so. But who shall Judge when it shall be\r\nproper to put an end to such a Parliament? there is no farther Answer\r\nleft him; but only, that the Reason of things is the only Rule: for when\r\nall necessary causes are dispatch'd, then is the proper time of\r\nDissolution. But if you mark it, this Argumentation is still running in\r\na Circle. For the Parliament, that is the House of Commons, would\r\nconstitute themselves Judges of this reason of things; and of what\r\ncauses were necessary to be dispatch'd. So that my Author had as good\r\nhave laid down this Position bare-fac'd, that a Parliament ought never\r\nto be Dissolved, till an House of Commons would sit no longer.\r\n\r\nMy Author goes on scoffingly, _That he has nothing to say for those\r\nangry men_ (he means of his own Party) _whose particular Designs are\r\ndisappointed; only that they might have kept their places; and that he\r\ncan find no difference betwixt them who are out, and those who are put\r\nin, but that the former could have ruin'd us, and would not: and these\r\ncannot if they would._\r\n\r\nI am willing to let them pass as lightly as he pleases: Angry they are,\r\nand they know the Proverb. I hope I may have leave to observe\r\ntransiently, that none but angry men, that is, such as hold themselves\r\ndisobliged at Court, are the Pillars of his Party. And where are then\r\nthe principles of Vertue, Honour and Religion, which they would persuade\r\nthe World, have animated their endeavours for the publick? What were\r\nthey before they were thus Angry? or what would they be, could they make\r\nso firm an Interest in Court, that they might venture themselves in that\r\nbottom? This, the whole Party cannot choose but know; for Knaves can\r\neasily smell out one another. My Author, an experienced man, makes but\r\nvery little difference, betwixt those who are out, and those who are put\r\nin. But the Nation begins to be awake: his party is mouldring away, and\r\nas it falls out, in all dishonest Combinations, are suspecting each\r\nother so very fast, that every man is shifting for himself, by a\r\nseparate Treaty: and looking out for a Plank in the common Shipwrack, so\r\nthat the point is turn'd upon him; those who are out, would have ruin'd\r\nus, and cou'd not; and those who are in, are endeavouring to save us if\r\nthey can.\r\n\r\nMy Adversary himself, now drawing to a conclusion, seems to be inclining\r\nto good opinions: and as dying men, are much given to repentance, so\r\nfinding his cause at the last gasp, he unburthens his Conscience and\r\ndisclaims the principles of a Common-wealth, both for himself, and for\r\nboth Houses of Parliament, which is indeed to be over-officious: for one\r\nof the Houses will not think they have need of such a Compurgator. But\r\nhe wisely fears no change of Government from any, but the Papists. Now I\r\nam of a better heart, for I fear it neither from Papists nor\r\nPresbyterians. Whether Democracy will agree with Jesuitical principles\r\nin _England_ I am not certain; but I can easily prove to him, that no\r\nGovernment but a Common-wealth is accommodated to the Systeme of\r\nChurch-worship invented by _John Calvin_.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration concludes, that the King is resolv'd to govern in all\r\nthings by the Laws: And here the Author of the Answer, is for frisking\r\nout into a fit of Joy, which looks as aukward with his gravity, as ever\r\nwas King _David_'s dancing before the Ark. This similitude I hope has\r\npleas'd him; if it does not, _Esop_'s Ass stands ready Sadled at the\r\ndoor. But a melancholick consideration has already pour'd cold water in\r\nhis Porredge, for all promises he says, _are either kept or broken_:\r\nwell-fare a good old Proverb. I could find in my heart to cap it with\r\nanother, _that the old Woman had never look'd for her Daughter in the\r\nOven, if she had not been there herself before_. But if the King should\r\nkeep his word, as all but his Enemies conclude he will, then we shall\r\nsee Annual Parliaments sit longer I hope; when they meddle only with\r\ntheir proper business. They will lose their time no more, in cutting off\r\nthe Succession, altering the course of Nature, and directing the\r\nprovidence of God, before they know it. We shall have no uniting of\r\nSects against the Church of _England_, nor of Counties against the next\r\nHeir of the Crown. The King shall then be advis'd by his Parliament,\r\nwhen both Houses concur in their advice. There shall be no more need of\r\nDeclarations about the dissolving of Parliaments, and no more need of\r\nfactious Fools to answer them; But the People shall be happy, the King\r\nshall be supply'd the Alliances shall be supported, and my suppos'd\r\nAuthor be made a Bishop, and renounce the Covenant. That many of these\r\nthings may happen, is the wish of every loyal Subject, and particularly\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, _Your most humble Servant_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Editors of_ THE AUGUSTAN REPRINT SOCIETY\r\n_are pleased to announce that_\r\nTHE WILLIAM ANDREWS CLARK MEMORIAL LIBRARY\r\n_of The University of California, Los Angeles_\r\n\r\n\r\nwill become the publisher of the Augustan Reprints in May, 1949.
