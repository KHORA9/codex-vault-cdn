It was colonized\r\n  by a people from Chalcis in Euboea, and commanded a large\r\n  district called Chalcidice, in which there were thirty-two\r\n  cities. Over all this tract the sway of Olynthus was\r\n  considerable, and she had waged wars anciently with Athens\r\n  and Sparta, and been formidable to Philip's predecessors on\r\n  the throne of Macedon. Soon after Philip's accession, the\r\n  Olynthians had disputes with him, which were at first\r\n  accommodated, and he gratified them by the cession of\r\n  Anthemus. They then joined him in a war against Athens, and\r\n  he gave up to them Potidaea, which had yielded to their\r\n  united arms. After the lapse of some years, during which\r\n  Philip had greatly increased his power, and acquired\r\n  considerable influence in Thessaly and Thrace, the Olynthians\r\n  became alarmed, and began to think him too dangerous a\r\n  neighbor. The immediate cause of rupture was an attack which\r\n  he made on one of the Chalcidian towns. An embassy was\r\n  instantly sent to Athens, to negotiate an alliance. Philip,\r\n  considering this as an infraction of their treaty with him,\r\n  declared war against them, and invaded their territory. A\r\n  second embassy was sent to Athens, pressing for assistance.\r\n  The question was debated in the popular assembly. Demades,\r\n  an orator of considerable ability, but profligate character,\r\n  opposed the alliance. Many speakers were heard; and at\r\n  length Demosthenes rose to support the prayer of the embassy,\r\n  delivering one of those clear and forcible speeches, which\r\n  seldom failed to make a strong impression on his audience.\r\n  The alliance was accepted, and succors voted.\r\n\r\n  The orator here delicately touches on the law of Eubulus,\r\n  which had made it capital to propose that the Theoric fund\r\n  should be applied to military service. This fund was in fact\r\n  the surplus revenue of the civil administration, which by the\r\n  ancient law was appropriated to the defense of the\r\n  commonwealth; but it had by various means been diverted from\r\n  that purpose, and expended in largesses to the people, to\r\n  enable them to attend the theatre, and other public shows and\r\n  amusements. The law of Eubulus perpetuated this abuse. (See my\r\n  article _Theorica_ in the Archaeological Dictionary.)\r\n  Demosthenes, seeing the necessity of a war supply, hints that\r\n  this absurd law ought to be abolished, but does not openly\r\n  propose it.\r\n\r\n  There has been much difference of opinion among the learned\r\n  as to the order of the three Olynthiac orations; nor is it\r\n  certain, whether they were spoken on the occasion of one\r\n  embassy, or several embassies. The curious may consult Bishop\r\n  Thirlwall's Appendix to the fifth volume of his Grecian\r\n  History, and Jacobs' Introduction to his translation. I have\r\n  followed the common order, as adopted by Bekker, whose edition\r\n  of Demosthenes is the text of this translation; and indeed my\r\n  opinion is, on the whole, in favor of preserving the common\r\n  order, though the plan of this work prevents my entering into\r\n  controversy on the question. To enable the reader more fully\r\n  to understand the following orations, I have in an Appendix\r\n  to this volume given a brief account of Olynthus, showing its\r\n  position with reference to Macedonia, and the importance of its\r\n  acquisition to Philip. The historical abstract prefixed to this\r\n  volume is intended chiefly to assist the reader in reference to\r\n  dates. Such occurrences only are noticed as may be useful to\r\n  illustrate Demosthenes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe, men of Athens, you would give much to know, what is the true\r\npolicy to be adopted in the present matter of inquiry. This being the\r\ncase, you should be willing to hear with attention these who offer you\r\ntheir counsel. Besides that you will have the benefit of all\r\npreconsidered advice, I esteem it part of your good fortune, that many\r\nfit suggestions will occur to some speakers at the moment, so that from\r\nthem all you may easily choose what is profitable.\r\n\r\nThe present juncture, Athenians, all but proclaims aloud, that you must\r\nyourselves take these affairs in hand, if you care for their success. I\r\nknow not how we seem disposed in the matter. [Footnote: This is a\r\ncautious way of hinting at the general reluctance to adopt a vigorous\r\npolicy. And the reader will observe the use of the first person, whereby\r\nthe orator includes himself in the same insinuation.] My own opinion is,\r\nvote succor immediately, and make the speediest preparations for sending\r\nit off from Athens, that you may not incur the same mishap as before;\r\nsend also embassadors, to announce this, and watch the proceedings. For\r\nthe danger is, that this man, being unscrupulous and clever at turning\r\nevents to account, making concessions when it suits him, threatening at\r\nother times, (his threats may well be believed,) slandering us and\r\nurging our absence against us, may convert and wrest to his use some of\r\nour main resources. Though, strange to say, Athenians, the very cause of\r\nPhilip's strength is a circumstance favorable to you. [Footnote: After\r\nalarming the people by showing the strength of their adversary, he turns\r\noff skillfully to a topic of encouragement.] His having it in his sole\r\npower to publish or conceal his designs, his being at the same time\r\ngeneral, sovereign, paymaster, and every where accompanying his army, is\r\na great advantage for quick and timely operations in war; but, for a\r\npeace with the Olynthians, which he would gladly make, it has a contrary\r\neffect. For it is plain to the Olynthians, that now they are fighting,\r\nnot for glory or a slice of territory, but to save their country from\r\ndestruction and servitude. They know how he treated those Amphipolitans\r\nwho surrendered to him their city, and those Pydneans who gave him\r\nadmittance. [Footnote: Amphipolis was a city at the head of the\r\nStrymonic gulf, in that part of Macedonia which approaches western\r\nThrace. It had been built formerly by an Athenian colony, and was taken\r\nby the Spartan general Brasidas in the Peloponnesian war. Ever since\r\nAthens regained her character of an imperial state, she had desired to\r\nrecover Amphipolis, which was important for its maritime position, its\r\nexportation of iron, and especially from the vicinity of the forests\r\nnear the Strymon, which afforded an inexhaustible supply of ship-timber.\r\nBut she had never been able to accomplish that object. Philip, who at\r\nthat time possessed no maritime town of importance, was for obvious\r\nreasons anxious to win Amphipolis for himself; and he got possession of\r\nit partly by force of arms, partly by the treachery of certain\r\nAmphipolitans who were attached to his interest. It seems the Athenians\r\nhad been amused by a promise of Philip to give up the town to them. The\r\nnon-performance of this compact led to their first long war with him.\r\nImmediately after the capture of Amphipolis, Philip marched against\r\nPydna, and was admitted into the town.] And generally, I believe, a\r\ndespotic power is mistrusted by free states, especially if their\r\ndominions are adjoining. All this being known to you, Athenians, all\r\nelse of importance considered, I say, you must take heart and spirit,\r\nand apply yourselves more than ever to the war, contributing promptly,\r\nserving personally, leaving nothing undone. No plea or pretense is left\r\nyou for declining your duty. What you were all so clamorous about, that\r\nthe Olynthians should be pressed into a war with Philip, has of itself\r\ncome to pass, [Footnote: Compare Virgil, Aen. ix. 6.\r\n\r\n  Turne, quod optanti Divum promittere nemo\r\n  Auderet, volvenda dies en attulit ultro.]\r\n\r\nand in a way most advantageous to you. For, had they undertaken the war\r\nat your instance, they might have been slippery allies, with minds but\r\nhalf resolved perhaps: but since they hate him on a quarrel of their\r\nown, their enmity is like to endure on account of their fears and their\r\nwrongs. You must not then, Athenians, forego this lucky opportunity, nor\r\ncommit the error which you have often done heretofore. For example, when\r\nwe returned from succoring the Euboeans, and Hierax and Stratocles of\r\nAmphipolis came to this platform, [Footnote: The hustings from which the\r\nspeakers addressed the people. It was cut to the height of ten feet out\r\nof the rock which formed the boundary wall of the assembly; and was\r\nascended by a flight of steps.] urging us to sail and receive possession\r\nof their city, if we had shown the same zeal for ourselves as for the\r\nsafety of Euboea, you would have held Amphipolis then and been rid of\r\nall the troubles that ensued. Again, when news came that Pydna,\r\n[Footnote: Potidaea was in the peninsula of Pallene, near Olynthus, and\r\nwas therefore given by Philip to the Olynthians, as mentioned in the\r\nargument. Methone and Pydna are on the Macedonian coast approaching\r\nThessaly. Pagasae is a Thessalian town in the Magnesian district. It was\r\nthe sea-port of Pherae, capital of the tyrant Lycophron, against whom\r\nPhilip was invited to assist the Thessalians. Philip overcame Lycophron,\r\nand restored republican government at Pherae; but Pagasae he garrisoned\r\nhimself, and also Magnesia, a coast-town in the same district.]\r\nPotidaea, Methone, Pagasae, and the other places (not to waste time in\r\nenumerating them) were besieged, had we to any one of these in the first\r\ninstance carried prompt and reasonable succor, we should have found\r\nPhilip far more tractable and humble now. But, by always neglecting the\r\npresent, and imagining the future would shift for itself, we, O men of\r\nAthens, have exalted Philip, and made him greater than any king of\r\nMacedon ever was. Here then is come a crisis, this of Olynthus,\r\nself-offered to the state, inferior to none of the former. And methinks,\r\nmen of Athens, any man fairly estimating what the gods have done for us,\r\nnotwithstanding many untoward circumstances, might with reason be\r\ngrateful to them. Our numerous losses in war may justly be charged to\r\nour own negligence; but that they happened not long ago, and that an\r\nalliance, to counterbalance them, is open to our acceptance, I must\r\nregard as manifestations of divine favor. It is much the same as in\r\nmoney matters. If a man keep what he gets, he is thankful to fortune; if\r\nhe lose it by imprudence, he loses withal his memory of the obligation.\r\nSo in political affairs, they who misuse their opportunities forget even\r\nthe good which the gods send them; for every prior event is judged\r\ncommonly by the last result. Wherefore, Athenians, we must be\r\nexceedingly careful of our future measures, that by amendment therein we\r\nmay efface the shame of the past. Should we abandon these men [Footnote:\r\nHere he points to the Olynthian embassadors.] too, and Philip reduce\r\nOlynthus, let any one tell me, what is to prevent him marching where he\r\npleases? Does any one of you, Athenians, compute or consider the means,\r\nby which Philip, originally weak, has become great? Having first taken\r\nAmphipolis, then Pydna, Potidaea next, Methone afterward, he invaded\r\nThessaly. Having ordered matters at Pherae, Pagasae, Magnesia, every\r\nwhere exactly as he pleased, he departed for Thrace; where, after\r\ndisplacing some kings and establishing others, he fell sick; again\r\nrecovering, he lapsed not into indolence, but instantly attacked the\r\nOlynthians. I omit his expeditions to Illyria and Paeonia, that against\r\nArymbas, [Footnote: Arymbas was a king of the Molossians in Epirus, and\r\nuncle of Olympias, Philip's wife.] and some others.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be said, do you mention all this now? That you, Athenians,\r\nmay feel and understand both the folly of continually abandoning one\r\nthing after another, and the activity which forms part of Philip's habit\r\nand existence, which makes it impossible for him to rest content with\r\nhis achievements. If it be his principle, ever to do more than he has\r\ndone, and yours, to apply yourselves vigorously to nothing, see what the\r\nend promises to be. Heavens! which of you is so simple as not to know,\r\nthat the war yonder will soon be here, if we are careless? And should\r\nthis happen, I fear, O Athenians, that as men who thoughtlessly borrow\r\non large interest, after a brief accommodation, lose their estate, so\r\nwill it be with us; found to have paid dear for our idleness and\r\nself-indulgence, we shall be reduced to many hard and unpleasant shifts,\r\nand struggle for the salvation of our country.\r\n\r\nTo censure, I may be told, is easy for any man; to show what measures\r\nthe case requires, is the part of a counselor. I am not ignorant,\r\nAthenians, that frequently, when any disappointment happens, you are\r\nangry, not with the parties in fault, but with the last speakers on the\r\nsubject; yet never, with a view to self-protection, would I suppress\r\nwhat I deem for your interest. I say then, you must give a two-fold\r\nassistance here; first, save the Olynthians their towns, [Footnote: The\r\nChalcidian towns. See the Argument. Philip commenced his aggressions\r\nupon the Olynthians by reducing several of these.] and send out troops\r\nfor that purpose; secondly, annoy the enemy's country with ships and\r\nother troops; omit either of these courses, and I doubt the expedition\r\nwill be fruitless. For should he, suffering your incursion, reduce\r\nOlynthus, he will easily march to the defense of his kingdom; or, should\r\nyou only throw succor into Olynthus, and he, seeing things out of danger\r\nat home, keep up a close and vigilant blockade, he must in time prevail\r\nover the besieged. Your assistance therefore must be effective, and\r\ntwo-fold.\r\n\r\nSuch are the operations I advise. As to a supply of money: you have\r\nmoney, Athenians; you have a larger military fund than any people; and\r\nyou receive it just as you please. If ye will assign this to your\r\ntroops, ye need no further supply; otherwise ye need a further, or\r\nrather ye have none at all. How then? some man may exclaim: do you move\r\nthat this be a military fund? Verily, not I. [Footnote: There is some\r\nstudied obscurity in this passage, owing to the necessity under which\r\nthe speaker lay of avoiding the penalty of the law and a little quiet\r\nsatire on his countrymen, who seemed desirous of eating their pudding\r\nand having it too. The logic of the argument runs thus--My opinion is,\r\nthat we ought to have a military fund, and that no man should receive\r\npublic money, without performing public service. However, as you prefer\r\ntaking the public money to pay for your places at the festivals, I will\r\nnot break the law by moving to apply that money to another purpose. Only\r\nyou gain nothing by it; for, as the troops must be paid, there must be\r\nan extraordinary contribution, or property tax, to meet the exigency of\r\nthe case.] My opinion indeed is, that there should be soldiers raised,\r\nand a military fund, and one and the same regulation for receiving and\r\nperforming what is due; only you just without trouble take your\r\nallowance for the festivals. It remains then, I imagine, that all must\r\ncontribute, if much be wanted, much, if little, little. Money must be\r\nhad; without it nothing proper can be done. Other persons propose other\r\nways and means. Choose which ye think expedient; and put hands to the\r\nwork, while it is yet time.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to consider and calculate how Philip's affairs now stand.\r\nThey are not, as they appear, or as an inattentive observer might\r\npronounce, in very good trim, or in the most favorable position. He\r\nwould never have commenced this war, had he imagined he must fight. He\r\nexpected to carry every thing on the first advance, and has been\r\nmistaken. This disappointment is one thing that troubles and dispirits\r\nhim; another is, the state of Thessaly. [Footnote: Philip's influence in\r\nThessaly was of material assistance to him in his ambitious projects. It\r\nwas acquired in this way. The power established by Jason of Pherae, who\r\nraised himself to a sort of royal authority under the title of Tagus,\r\nhad devolved upon Lycophron. His sway extended more or less over the\r\nwhole of Thessaly; but was, if not generally unpopular, at least\r\nunacceptable to the great families in the northern towns, among whom the\r\nAleuadae of Larissa held a prominent place. They invoked Philip's aid,\r\nwhile Lycophron was assisted by the Phocian Onomarchus. After various\r\nsuccess, Onomarchus was defeated and slain, and Lycophron expelled from\r\nPherae. This established Philip's influence, and led to his being\r\nafterward called in to terminate the Sacred war. How far the assertions\r\nof Demosthenes, respecting the discontent of the Thessalians, are true,\r\ncan not exactly be told. They are confirmed, however, in some degree by\r\nthe fact, that at the close of the Sacred war Philip restored to them\r\nMagnesia. A new attempt by the regnant family caused Philip again to be\r\ninvited, and Thessaly became virtually a province of Macedonia. Among\r\nother advantages therefrom was the aid of a numerous cavalry, for which\r\nThessaly was famous.] That people were always, you know, treacherous to\r\nall men; and just as they ever have been, they are to Philip. They have\r\nresolved to demand the restitution of Pagasae, and have prevented his\r\nfortifying Magnesia; and I was told, they would no longer allow him to\r\ntake the revenue of their harbors and markets, which they say should be\r\napplied to the public business of Thessaly, not received by Philip. Now,\r\nif he be deprived of this fund, his means will be much straitened for\r\npaying his mercenaries. And surely we must suppose, that Paeonians and\r\nIllyrians, and all such people, would rather be free and independent\r\nthan under subjection; for they are unused to obedience, and the man is\r\na tyrant. So report says, and I can well believe it; for undeserved\r\nsuccess leads weak-minded men into folly; and thus it appears often,\r\nthat to maintain prosperity is harder than to acquire it. Therefore must\r\nyou, Athenians, looking on his difficulty as your opportunity, assist\r\ncheerfully in the war, sending embassies where required, taking arms\r\nyourselves, exciting all other people; for if Philip got such an\r\nopportunity against us, and there was a war on our frontier, how eagerly\r\nthink ye he would attack you! Then are you not ashamed, that the very\r\ndamage which you would suffer, if he had the power, you dare not seize\r\nthe moment to inflict on him?\r\n\r\nAnd let not this escape you, Athenians, that you have now the choice,\r\nwhether you shall fight there, or he in your country. If Olynthus hold\r\nout, you will fight there and distress his dominions, enjoying your own\r\nhome in peace. If Philip take that city, who shall then prevent his\r\nmarching here? Thebans? I wish it be not too harsh to say, they will be\r\nready to join in the invasion. Phocians? who can not defend their own\r\ncountry without your assistance. Or some other ally? But, good sir, he\r\nwill not desire! Strange indeed, if, what he is thought fool-hardy for\r\nprating now, this he would not accomplish if he might. As to the vast\r\ndifference between a war here or there, I fancy there needs no argument.\r\nIf you were obliged to be out yourselves for thirty days only, and take\r\nthe necessaries for camp-service from the land, (I mean, without an\r\nenemy therein,) your agricultural population would sustain, I believe,\r\ngreater damage than what the whole expense of the late war [Footnote:\r\nThe Amphipolitan war, said to have cost fifteen hundred talents.]\r\namounted to. But if a war should come, what damage must be expected?\r\nThere is the insult too, and the disgrace of the thing, worse than any\r\ndamage to right-thinking men.\r\n\r\nOn all these accounts, then, we must unite to lend our succor, and drive\r\noff the war yonder; the rich, that, spending a little for the abundance\r\nwhich they happily possess, they may enjoy the residue in security; the\r\nyoung, [Footnote: Strictly, _those of the military age_, which was\r\nfrom eighteen years to sixty. Youths between eighteen and twenty were\r\nliable only to serve in Attica, and were chiefly employed to garrison\r\nthe walls. Afterward they were compellable to perform any military\r\nservice, under the penalty of losing their privileges as citizens. The\r\nexpression in the text, it will be seen, is not rendered with full\r\naccuracy; as those of the military age can only be called _young_\r\nby comparison. But a short and apt antithesis was needed. Sometimes I\r\nhave \"the service-able\" or \"the able-bodied.\" Jacobs: _die\r\nwaffenfahigen Junglinge_, and elsewhere, _die Rustige_.] that,\r\ngaining military experience in Philip's territory, they may become\r\nredoubtable champions to preserve their own; the orators, that they may\r\npass a good account [Footnote: Every man, who is required to justify the\r\nacts for which he is responsible, may be said to be \"called to account.\"\r\nBut Demosthenes spoke with peculiar reference to those accounts, which\r\nmen in official situations at Athens were required to render at the\r\nclose of their administration.] of their statesmanship; for on the\r\nresult of measures will depend your judgment of their conduct. May it\r\nfor every cause be prosperous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND OLYNTHIAC.\r\n\r\n  THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  The Athenians had voted an alliance with the Olynthians, and\r\n  resolved to send succors. But the sending of them was delayed,\r\n  partly by the contrivance of the opposite faction, partly\r\n  from the reluctance of the people themselves to engage in a\r\n  war with Philip. Demosthenes stimulates them to exertion, and\r\n  encourages them, by showing that Philip's power is not so\r\n  great as it appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn many occasions, men of Athens, one may see the kindness of the gods\r\nto this country manifested, but most signally, I think, on the present.\r\nThat here are men prepared for a war with Philip, possessed of a\r\nneighboring territory and some power, and (what is most important) so\r\nfixed in their hostility, as to regard any accommodation with him as\r\ninsecure, and even ruinous to their country; this really appears like an\r\nextraordinary act of divine beneficence. It must then be our care,\r\nAthenians, that we are not more unkind to ourselves than circumstances\r\nhave been; as it would be a foul, a most foul reproach, to have\r\nabandoned not only cities and places that once belonged to us, but also\r\nthe allies and advantages provided by fortune.\r\n\r\nTo dilate, Athenians, on Philip's power, and by such discourse to incite\r\nyou to your duty, I think improper: and why? Because all that may be\r\nsaid on that score involves matter of glory for him, and misconduct on\r\nour part. The more he has transcended his repute, [Footnote: Jacobs\r\notherwise: uber sein Verdienst gelungen.] the more is he universally\r\nadmired; you, as you have used your advantages unworthily, have incurred\r\nthe greater disgrace. This topic, then, I shall pass over. Indeed,\r\nAthenians, a correct observer will find the source of his greatness\r\nhere, [Footnote: In this assembly, by the contrivance of venal orators,\r\nor through the supineness of the people. In the first Philippic there is\r\na more pointed allusion to the practices of Philip's adherents, who are\r\ncharged with sending him secret intelligence of what passed at home.\r\nSuch men as Aristodemus, Neoptolemus, perhaps Demades and others are\r\nreferred to. Aeschines had not yet begun to be a friend of Philip.] and\r\nnot in himself. But of measures, for which Philip's partisans deserve\r\nhis gratitude and your vengeance, I see no occasion to speak now. Other\r\nthings are open to me, which it concerns you all to know, and which\r\nmust, on a due examination, Athenians, reflect great disgrace on Philip.\r\nTo these will I address myself.\r\n\r\nTo call him perjured and treacherous, without showing what he has done,\r\nmight justly be termed idle abuse. But to go through all his actions and\r\nconvict him in detail, will take, as it happens, but a short time, and\r\nis expedient, I think, for two reasons: first, that his baseness may\r\nappear in its true light; secondly, that they, whose terror imagines\r\nPhilip to be invincible, may see he has run through all the artifices by\r\nwhich he rose to greatness, and his career is just come to an end. I\r\nmyself, men of Athens, should most assuredly have regarded Philip as an\r\nobject of fear and admiration, had I seen him exalted by honorable\r\nconduct; but observing and considering I find, that in the beginning,\r\nwhen certain persons drove away the Olynthians who desired a conference\r\nwith us, he gained over our simplicity by engaging to surrender\r\nAmphipolis, and to execute the secret article [Footnote: A secret\r\nintrigue was carried on between Philip and the Athenians, by which he\r\nengaged to put Amphipolis in their hands, but on the understanding that\r\nthey would deliver up Pydna to him. Demosthenes only mentions the former\r\npart of the arrangement, the latter not being honorable to his\r\ncountrymen.] once so famous; afterward he got the friendship of the\r\nOlynthians, by taking Potidaea from you, wronging you his former allies,\r\nand delivering it to them; and lastly now the Thessalians, by promising\r\nto surrender Magnesia, and undertake the Phocian war on their behalf. In\r\nshort, none who have dealt with him has he not deceived. He has risen by\r\nconciliating and cajoling the weakness of every people in turn who knew\r\nhim not. As, therefore, by such means he rose, when every people\r\nimagined he would advance their interest, so ought he by the same means\r\nto be pulled down again, when the selfish aim of his whole policy is\r\nexposed. To this crisis, O Athenians, are Philip's affairs come; or let\r\nany man stand forward and prove to me, or rather to you, that my\r\nassertions, are false, or that men whom Philip has once overreached will\r\ntrust him hereafter, or that the Thessalians who have been degraded into\r\nservitude would not gladly become free.\r\n\r\nBut if any among you, though agreeing in these statements, thinks that\r\nPhilip will maintain his power by having occupied forts and havens and\r\nthe like, this is a mistake. True, when a confederacy subsists by\r\ngood-will, and all parties to the war have a common interest, men are\r\nwilling to co-operate and bear hardships and persevere. But when one has\r\ngrown strong, like Philip, by rapacity and artifice, on the first\r\npretext, the slightest reverse, all is overturned and broken up.\r\n[Footnote: The original [Greek: _anechaitise_] is \"shakes off,\" or\r\n\"throws off,\" as a horse does his rider, when he rears and tosses up his\r\nneck. It will be observed that Demosthenes is very high-flown in his\r\nlanguage here, passing from one metaphor to another. Leland translates\r\nthese words, \"overthrows him, and all his greatness is dashed at once to\r\nthe ground.\" Francis: \"hath already shaken off the yoke and dissolved\r\ntheir alliance.\" Wilson: \"turneth all things upside down and layeth it\r\nflat in the end.\" Auger, better: _suffisent pour l' ebranler et la\r\ndissoudre_. Jacobs: _reicht Alles umzusturzen, und aufzulosen_.\r\nPabst, very nearly the same.] Impossible is it,--impossible,\r\nAthenians,--to acquire a solid power by injustice and perjury and\r\nfalsehood. Such things last for once, or for a short period; maybe, they\r\nblossom fairly with hope; [Footnote: So in Henry VIII. Act iii. Sc. 2.\r\n\r\n  Such is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\r\n  The tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms,\r\n  And wears his blushing honors thick upon him.]\r\n\r\nbut in time they are discovered and drop away. [Footnote: Like the\r\nleaves of a flower; pursuing the last metaphor. So says Moore, in _The\r\nLast Rose of Summer_: \"the gems drop away.\" Jacobs: _fallt sie von\r\nselbst zusammen_. Pabst: _sturet in sich selbst zusammen_.] As a\r\nhouse, a ship, or the like, ought to have the lower parts firmest, so in\r\nhuman conduct, I ween, the principle and foundation should be just and\r\ntrue. But this is not so in Philip's conduct.\r\n\r\nI say, then, we should at once aid the Olynthians, (the best and\r\nquickest way that can be suggested will please me most,) and send an\r\nembassy to the Thessalians, to inform some of our measures, and to stir\r\nup the rest; for they have now resolved to demand Pagasae, and\r\nremonstrate about Magnesia. But look to this, Athenians, that our envoys\r\nshall not only make speeches, but have some real proof that we have gone\r\nforth as becomes our country, and are engaged in action. All speech\r\nwithout action appears vain and idle, but especially that of our\r\ncommonwealth; as the more we are thought to excel therein, the more is\r\nour speaking distrusted by all. You must show yourselves greatly\r\nreformed, greatly changed, contributing, serving personally, acting\r\npromptly, before any one will pay attention to you. And if ye will\r\nperform these duties properly and becomingly, Athenians, not only will\r\nit appear that Philip's alliances are weak and precarious, but the poor\r\nstate of his native empire and power will be revealed.\r\n\r\nTo speak roundly, the Macedonian power and empire is very well as a\r\nhelp, as it was for you in Timotheus' time against the Olynthians;\r\nlikewise for them against Potidaea the conjunction was important; and\r\nlately it aided the Thessalians in their broils and troubles against the\r\nregnant house: and the accession of any power, however small, is\r\nundoubtedly useful. But the Macedonian is feeble of itself, and full of\r\ndefects. The very operations which seem to constitute Philip's\r\ngreatness, his wars and his expeditions, have made it more insecure than\r\nit was originally. Think not, Athenians, that Philip and his subjects\r\nhave the same likings. He desires glory, makes that his passion, is\r\nready for any consequence of adventure and peril, preferring to a life\r\nof safety the honor of achieving what no Macedonian king ever did\r\nbefore. They have no share in the glorious result; ever harassed by\r\nthese excursions up and down, they suffer and toil incessantly, allowed\r\nno leisure for their employments or private concerns, unable even to\r\ndispose of their hard earnings, the markets of the country being closed\r\non account of the war. By this then may easily be seen, how the\r\nMacedonians in general are disposed to Philip. His mercenaries and\r\nguards, indeed, have the reputation of admirable and well-trained\r\nsoldiers, but, as I heard from one who had been in the country, a man\r\nincapable of falsehood, they are no better than others. For if there be\r\nany among them experienced in battles and campaigns, Philip is jealous\r\nof such men and drives them away, he says, wishing to keep the glory of\r\nall actions to himself; his jealousy (among other failings) being\r\nexcessive. Or if any man be generally good and virtuous, unable to bear\r\nPhilip's daily intemperances, drunkenness, and indecencies, [Footnote:\r\nThe original signifies a certain lascivious dance, which formed a part\r\nof riotous festivities. We gather from history that the orator's\r\ndescription here is not wholly untrue, though exaggerated. Thirlwall\r\nthus writes of Philip: \"There seem to have been two features in his\r\ncharacter which, in another station, or under different circumstances,\r\nmight have gone near to lower him to an ordinary person, but which were\r\nso controlled by his fortune as to contribute not a little to his\r\nsuccess. He appears to have been by his temperament prone to almost\r\nevery kind of sensual pleasure; but as his life was too busy to allow\r\nhim often to indulge his bias, his occasional excesses wore the air of\r\nan amiable condescension. So his natural humor would perhaps have led\r\nhim too often to forget his dignity in his intercourse with his\r\ninferiors; but to Philip, the great king, the conqueror, the restless\r\npolitician, these intervals of relaxation occurred so rarely, that they\r\nmight strengthen his influence with the vulgar, and could never expose\r\nhim to contempt.\" It has been observed, that Philips partiality for\r\ndrinking and dancing, his drollery, and a dash of scurrility in his\r\ncharacter, endeared him especially to the Thessalians. See Jacobs' note\r\non this passage.] he is pushed aside and accounted as nobody. The rest\r\nabout him are brigands and parasites, and men of that character, who\r\nwill get drunk and perform dances which I scruple to name before you. My\r\ninformation is undoubtedly true; for persons whom all scouted here as\r\nworse rascals than mountebanks, Callias the town-slave and the like of\r\nhim, antic-jesters, [Footnote: [Greek: _Mimous geloion_], players\r\nof drolls, mimes, or farces. Our ancient word _droll_ signifies,\r\nlike [Greek: _mimos_], both the actor and the thing acted.] and\r\ncomposers of ribald songs to lampoon their companions, such persons\r\nPhilip caresses and keeps about him. Small matters these may be thought,\r\nAthenians, but to the wise they are strong indications of his character\r\nand wrong-headedness. Success perhaps throws a shade over them now;\r\nprosperity is a famous hider of such blemishes; but, on any miscarriage,\r\nthey will be fully exposed. And this (trust me, Athenians) will appear\r\nin no long time, if the gods so will and you determine. For as in the\r\nhuman body, a man in health feels not partial ailments, but, when\r\nillness occurs, all are in motion, whether it be a rupture or a sprain\r\nor any thing else unsound; so with states and monarchs, while they wage\r\neternal war, their weaknesses are undiscerned by most men, but the tug\r\nof a frontier war betrays all.\r\n\r\nIf any of you think Philip a formidable opponent, because they see he is\r\nfortunate, such reasoning is prudent, Athenians. Fortune has indeed a\r\ngreat preponderance--nay, is every thing, in human affairs. Not but\r\nthat, if I had the choice, I should prefer our fortune to Philip's,\r\nwould you but moderately perform your duty. For I see you have many more\r\nclaims to the divine favor than he has. But we sit doing nothing; and a\r\nman idle himself can not require even his friends to act for him, much\r\nless the gods. No wonder then that he, marching and toiling in person,\r\npresent on all occasions, neglecting no time or season, prevails over us\r\ndelaying and voting and inquiring. I marvel not at that; the contrary\r\nwould have been marvelous, if we doing none of the duties of war had\r\nbeaten one doing all. But this surprises me, that formerly, Athenians,\r\nyou resisted the Lacedaemonians for the rights of Greece, and rejecting\r\nmany opportunities of selfish gain, to secure the rights of others,\r\nexpended your property in contributions, and bore the brunt of the\r\nbattle; yet now you are both to serve, slow to contribute, in defense of\r\nyour own possessions, and, though you have often saved the other nations\r\nof Greece collectively and individually, under your own losses you sit\r\nstill. This surprises me, and one thing more, Athenians; that not one of\r\nyou can reckon, how long your war with Philip has lasted, and what you\r\nhave been doing while the time has passed. You surely know, that while\r\nyou have been delaying, expecting others to act, accusing, trying one\r\nanother, expecting again, doing much the same as ye do now, all the time\r\nhas passed away. Then are ye so senseless, Athenians, as to imagine,\r\nthat the same measures, which have brought the country from a prosperous\r\nto a poor condition, will bring it from a poor to a prosperous?\r\nUnreasonable were this and unnatural; for all things are easier kept\r\nthan gotten. The war now has left us nothing to keep; we have all to\r\nget, and the work must be done by ourselves. I say then, you must\r\ncontribute money, serve in person with alacrity, accuse no one, till you\r\nhave gained your objects; then, judging from facts, honor the deserving,\r\npunish offenders; let there be no pretenses or defaults on your own part\r\nfor you can not harshly scrutinize the conduct of others, unless you\r\nhave done what is right yourselves. Why, think you, do all the generals\r\n[Footnote: A system of employing mercenary troops sprang up at the close\r\nof the Peloponnesian war, when there were numerous Grecian bands\r\naccustomed to warfare and seeking employment. Such troops were eagerly\r\nsought for by the Persian satraps and their king, by such men as Jason\r\nof Pherae, Dionysius of Syracuse, or Philomelus of Phocis. Athens, which\r\nhad partially employed mercenaries before, began to make use of them on\r\na large scale, while her citizens preferred staying at home, to attend\r\nto commerce, politics, and idle amusements. The ill effects however were\r\nsoon apparent. Athenian generals, ill supplied with money, and having\r\nlittle control over their followers, were tempted or obliged to engage\r\nin enterprises unconnected with, and often adverse to, the interests of\r\ntheir country. Sometimes the general, as well as the troops, was an\r\nalien, and could be very little depended on. Such a person was\r\nCharidemus, a native of Oreus in Euboea, who commenced his career as\r\ncaptain of a pirate vessel. He was often in the service of Athens, but\r\ndid her more harm than good. See my article _Mercenarii_, Arch.\r\nDict.] whom you commission avoid this war, and seek wars of their own?\r\n(for of the generals too must a little truth be told.) Because here the\r\nprizes of the war are yours; for example, if Amphipolis be taken, you\r\nwill immediately recover it; the commanders have all the risk and no\r\nreward. But in the other case the risks are less, and the gains belong\r\nto the commanders and soldiers; Lampsacus, [Footnote: Chares, the\r\nAthenian general, was said to have received these Asiatic cities from\r\nArtabazus, the Persian satrap, in return for the service he had\r\nperformed. Probably it was some authority or privileges in those cities,\r\nnot the actual dominion, that was conferred upon him. Sigeum, which is\r\nnear the mouth of the Hellespont, and was a convenient situation for his\r\nadventures, was the ordinary residence of Chares.] Sigeum, the vessels\r\nwhich they plunder. So they proceed to secure their several interests:\r\nyou, when you look at the bad state of your affairs, bring the generals\r\nto trial; but when they get a hearing and plead these necessities, you\r\ndismiss them. The result is that, while you are quarreling and divided,\r\nsome holding one opinion, some another, the commonwealth goes wrong.\r\nFormerly, Athenians, you had boards [Footnote: This refers to the\r\ninstitution of the [Greek: _summoriai_], or boards for management\r\nof the property-tax at Athens, as to which see Appendix IV. The argument\r\nof Demosthenes is as follows--The three hundred wealthier citizens, who\r\nwere associated by law for purposes of taxation, had become a clique for\r\npolitical purposes, with an orator at their head, (he intentionally uses\r\nthe term [Greek: _haegemon_], _chairman of the board_,) to\r\nconduct the business of the assembly, while they stood to shout and\r\napplaud his speeches. The general, who held a judicial court to decide\r\ndisputes about the property-tax, and who in matters of state ought to be\r\nindependent, was subservient to the orator, who defended him in the\r\npopular assembly.] for taxes; now you have boards for politics. There is\r\nan orator presiding on either side, a general under him, and three\r\nhundred men to shout; the rest of you are attached to the one party or\r\nthe other. This you must leave off; be yourselves again; establish a\r\ngeneral liberty of speech, deliberation, and action. If some are\r\nappointed to command as with royal authority, some to be ship-captains,\r\ntax-payers, soldiers by compulsion, others only to vote against them,\r\nand help in nothing besides, no duty will be seasonably performed; the\r\naggrieved parties will still fail you, and you will have to punish them\r\ninstead of your enemies. I say, in short; you must all fairly\r\ncontribute, according to each man's ability; take your turns of service\r\ntill you have all been afield; give every speaker a hearing, and adopt\r\nthe best counsel, not what this or that person advises. If ye act thus,\r\nnot only will ye praise the speaker at the moment, but yourselves\r\nafterward, when the condition of the country is improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD OLYNTHIAC.\r\n\r\n  THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  The Athenians had dispatched succors to Olynthus, and\r\n  received, as Libanius says, some favorable intelligence; more\r\n  probably, however, some vague rumors, which led them to\r\n  imagine the danger was for the time averted. They began, very\r\n  prematurely, as the result showed, to be confident of success,\r\n  and talked of punishing Philip for his presumption. In this\r\n  they were encouraged by certain foolish orators, who sought to\r\n  flatter the national prejudices. Demosthenes in this oration\r\n  strives to check the arrogance of the people; reminds them of\r\n  the necessity of defensive rather than offensive measures, and\r\n  especially of the importance of preserving their allies.\r\n  He again adverts (and this time more boldly) to the law of\r\n  Eubulus, which he intimates ought to be repealed; and he\r\n  exhorts the Athenians generally to make strenuous exertions\r\n  against Philip,\r\n\r\n\r\nNot the same ideas, men of Athens, are presented to me, when I look at\r\nour condition and when at the speeches which are delivered. The\r\nspeeches, I find, are about punishing Philip; but our condition is come\r\nto this, that we must mind we are not first damaged ourselves.\r\nTherefore, it seems to me, these orators commit the simple error of not\r\nlaying before you the true subject of debate. That once we might safely\r\nhave held our own and punished Philip too, I know well enough; both have\r\nbeen possible in my own time, not very long ago. But now, I am\r\npersuaded, it is sufficient in the first instance to effect the\r\npreservation of our allies. When this has been secured, one may look out\r\nfor revenge on Philip; but before we lay the foundation right, I deem it\r\nidle to talk about the end.\r\n\r\nThe present crisis, O Athenians, requires, if any ever did, much thought\r\nand counsel. Not that I am puzzled, what advice to give in the matter; I\r\nam only doubtful, in what way, Athenians, to address you thereupon. For\r\nI have been taught both by hearsay and experience, that most of your\r\nadvantages have escaped you, from unwillingness to do your duty, not\r\nfrom ignorance. I request you, if I speak my mind, to be patient, and\r\nconsider only, whether I speak the truth, and with a view to future\r\namendment. You see to what wretched plight we are reduced by some men\r\nharanguing for popularity.\r\n\r\nI think it necessary, however, first to recall to your memory a few past\r\nevents. You remember, Athenians, when news came three or four years ago,\r\nthat Philip was in Thrace beieging Heraeum. [Footnote: A fortress on the\r\nPropontis,(now Sea of Marmora,) near Perinthus. This was a post of\r\nimportance to the Athenians, who received large supplies of corn from\r\nthat district.] It was then the fifth month, [Footnote: Corresponding\r\nnearly to our November. The Attic year began in July, and contained\r\ntwelve lunar months, of alternately 29 and 30 days. The Greeks attempted\r\nto make the lunar and solar courses coincide by cycles of years, but\r\nfell into great confusion. See _Calendarium_ in Arch. Dict.] and\r\nafter much discussion and tumult in the assembly you resolved to launch\r\nforty galleys, that every citizen under forty-five [Footnote: This large\r\nproportion of the serviceable citizens, [Greek: _ton en haelikia_],\r\nshows the alarm at Athens. Philip's illness seems to have put a stop to\r\nhis progress in Thrace at this period. Immediately on his recovery he\r\nbegan his aggression against Olynthus. See the Chronological Abstract\r\nprefixed to this volume.] should embark, and a tax be raised of sixty\r\ntalents. That year passed; the first, second, third month arrived; in\r\nthat month, reluctantly, after the mysteries, [Footnote: The Eleusinian\r\nMysteries, in honor of Ceres and Proserpine, called The Mysteries from\r\ntheir peculiar sanctity.] you dispatched Charidemus with ten empty ships\r\nand five talents in money; for as Philip was reported to be sick or\r\ndead, (both rumors came.) you thought there was no longer any occasion\r\nfor succors, and discontinued the armament. But that was the very\r\noccasion; if we had then sent our succors quickly, as we resolved,\r\nPhilip would not have been saved to trouble us now.\r\n\r\nThose events can not be altered. But here is the crisis of another war,\r\nthe cause why I mentioned the past, that you may not repeat your error.\r\nHow shall we deal with it, men of Athens? If you lend not the utmost\r\npossible aid, see how you will have manoeuvred every thing for Philip's\r\nbenefit. There were the Olynthians, possessed of some power; and matters\r\nstood thus: Philip distrusted them, and they Philip. We negotiated for\r\npeace with them; this hampered (as it were) and annoyed Philip, that a\r\ngreat city, reconciled to us, should be watching opportunities against\r\nhim. We thought it necessary by all means to make that people his\r\nenemies; and lo, what erewhile you clamored for, has somehow or other\r\nbeen accomplished. Then what remains, Athenians, but to assist them\r\nvigorously and promptly? I know not. For besides the disgrace that would\r\nfall upon us, if we sacrificed any of our interests, I am alarmed for\r\nthe consequences, seeing how the Thebans are affected toward us, the\r\nPhocian treasury exhausted, nothing to prevent Philip, when he has\r\nsubdued what lies before him, from turning to matters here. Whoever\r\npostpones until then the performance of his duty, wishes to see the\r\nperil at hand, when he may hear of it elsewhere, and to seek auxiliaries\r\nfor himself, when he may be auxiliary to others; for that this will be\r\nthe issue, if we throw away our present advantage, we all know pretty\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, we have resolved that succors are necessary, and we\r\nwill send them; tell us only how. Marvel not then, Athenians, if I say\r\nsomething to astonish the multitude. Appoint law-revisers: [Footnote: A\r\nprovision was made by Solon for a periodical revision, of the Athenian\r\nlaws by means of a legislative committee, called [Greek:\r\n_Nomothetai_]. See my article _Nomothetes_, Arch. Dict.) They\r\nwere chosen by lot from the judicial body, on a reference to them by a\r\nvote of the popular assembly, Demosthenes says, \"enact no statutes,\"\r\ninstead of saying, \"let the committee enact no statutes.\" This is\r\nbecause the committee would be taken from the people themselves, and the\r\npart are treated as the whole. So in speeches to juries we shall\r\nfrequently observe that in mentioning the decision of some other jury he\r\nsays, \"you did this or that,\" as if they were the same persons.] at\r\ntheir session enact no statutes, for you have enough, but repeal those\r\nwhich are at present injurious; I mean, just plainly, the laws\r\nconcerning our theatrical fund, and some concerning the troops, whereof\r\nthe former divide the military fund among stayers-at-home for theatrical\r\namusement, the latter indemnify deserters, and so dishearten men well\r\ninclined to the service. When you have repealed these, and made the road\r\nto good counsel safe, then find a man to propose what you all know to be\r\ndesirable. But before doing so, look not for one who will advise good\r\nmeasures and be destroyed by you for his pains. Such a person you will\r\nnot find, especially as the only result would be, for the adviser and\r\nmover to suffer wrongfully, and, without forwarding matters, to render\r\ngood counsel still more dangerous in future. Besides, Athenians, you\r\nshould require the same men to repeal these laws, who have introduced\r\nthem. It is unjust, that their authors should enjoy a popularity which\r\nhas injured the commonwealth, while the adviser of salutary measures\r\nsuffers by a displeasure that may lead to general improvement. Till this\r\nis set right, Athenians, look not that any one should be so powerful\r\nwith you as to transgress these laws with impunity, or so senseless as\r\nto plunge into ruin right before him.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, too, you should observe, Athenians, that a decree is\r\nworth nothing, without a readiness on your part to do what you\r\ndetermine. Could decrees of themselves compel you to perform your duty,\r\nor execute what they prescribe, neither would you with many decrees have\r\naccomplished little or nothing, nor would Philip have insulted you so\r\nlong. Had it depended on decrees, he would have been chastised long ago.\r\nBut the course of things is otherwise. Action, posterior in order of\r\ntime to speaking and voting, is in efficacy prior and superior. This\r\nrequisite you want; the others you possess. There are among you,\r\nAthenians, men competent to advise what is needful, and you are\r\nexceedingly quick at understanding it; ay, and you will be able now to\r\nperform it, if you act rightly. For what time or season would you have\r\nbetter than the present? When will you do your duty, if not now? Has not\r\nthe man got possession of all our strongholds? And if he become master\r\nof this country, shall we not incur foul disgrace? Are not they, to whom\r\nwe promised sure protection in case of war, at this moment in\r\nhostilities? Is he not an enemy, holding our possessions--a barbarian\r\n[Footnote: _Barbarians_ (among the Greeks) designates persons who\r\nwere not of Hellenic origin. Alexander, an ancestor of Philip, had\r\nobtained admission to the Olympic games by proving himself to be of\r\nArgive descent. But the Macedonian people were scarcely considered as\r\nGreeks till a much later period; and Demosthenes speaks rather with\r\nreference to the nation than to Philip personally.]--anything you like\r\nto call him? But, O heavens! after permitting, almost helping him to\r\naccomplish these things, shall we inquire who were to blame for them? I\r\nknow we shall not take the blame to ourselves. For so in battles, no\r\nrunaway accuses himself, but his general, his neighbor, any one rather;\r\nthough, sure enough, the defeat is owing to all the runaways; for each\r\none who accuses the rest might have stood his ground, and had each done\r\nso they would have conquered. Now then, does any man not give the best\r\nadvice? Let another rise and give it, but not censure the last speaker.\r\nDoes a second give better advice? Follow it, and success attend you!\r\nPerhaps it is not pleasant: but that is not the speaker's fault, unless\r\nhe omits some needful prayer. [Footnote: Demosthenes sneers at the\r\ncustom of introducing into the debate sententious professions of\r\ngood-will, and prayers for prosperity; a poor substitute (he would say)\r\nfor good counsel. Compare Virg. Georg. III. 454.\r\n\r\n      Alitur vitium vivitque tegendo,\r\n  Dum medicas adhibere manus ad vulnera pastor\r\n  Abnegat, et meliora, Deos sedet omina poscens.]\r\n\r\nTo pray is simple enough, Athenians, collecting all that one desires in\r\na short petition: but to decide, when measures are the subject of\r\nconsideration, is not quite so easy; for we must choose the profitable\r\nrather than the pleasant, where both are not compatible.\r\n\r\nBut if any one can let alone our theatrical fund, and suggest other\r\nsupplies for the military, is he not cleverer? it may be asked. I grant\r\nit, if this were possible: but I wonder if any man ever was or will be\r\nable, after wasting his means in useless expenses, to find means for\r\nuseful. The wishes of men are indeed a great help to such arguments, and\r\ntherefore the easiest thing in the world is self-deceit; for every man\r\nbelieves what he wishes, though the reality is often different. See\r\nthen, Athenians, what the realities allow, and you will be able to serve\r\nand have pay. It becomes not a wise or magnanimous people, to neglect\r\nmilitary operations for want of money, and bear disgraces like these;\r\nor, while you snatch up arms to march against Corinthians and Megarians,\r\nto let Philip enslave Greek cities for lack of provisions for your\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nI have not spoken for the idle purpose of giving offense: I am not so\r\nfoolish or perverse, as to provoke your displeasure without intending\r\nyour good: but I think an upright citizen should prefer the advancement\r\nof the commonweal to the gratification of his audience. And I hear, as\r\nperhaps you do, that the speakers in our ancestors' time, whom all that\r\naddress you praise, but not exactly imitate, were politicians after this\r\nform and fashion;--Aristides, Nicias, my namesake, [Footnote:\r\nDemosthenes, the general so distinguished in the Peloponnesian war, who\r\ndefeated the Spartans at Pylus, and afterward lost his life in Sicily.]\r\nPericles. But since these orators have appeared, who ask, What is your\r\npleasure? what shall I move? how can I oblige you? the public welfare is\r\ncomplimented away for a moment's popularity, and these are the results;\r\nthe orators thrive, you are disgraced. Mark, O Athenians, what a summary\r\ncontrast may be drawn between the doings in our olden time and in yours.\r\nIt is a tale brief and familiar to all; for the examples by which you\r\nmay still be happy are found not abroad, men of Athens, but at home. Our\r\nforefathers, whom the speakers humored not nor caressed, as these men\r\ncaress you, for five-and-forty years took the leadership of the Greeks\r\nby general consent, and brought above ten thousand talents into the\r\ncitadel; and the king of this country was submissive to them, as a\r\nbarbarian should be to Greeks; and many glorious trophies they erected\r\nfor victories won by their own fighting on land and sea, and they are\r\nthe sole people in the world who have bequeathed a renown superior to\r\nenvy. Such were their merits in the affairs of Greece: see what they\r\nwere at home, both as citizens and as men. Their public works are\r\nedifices and ornaments of such beauty and grandeur in temples and\r\nconsecrated furniture, that posterity have no power to surpass them. In\r\nprivate they were so modest and attached to the principle of our\r\nconstitution, that whoever knows the style of house which Aristides had,\r\nor Miltiades, and the illustrious of that day, perceives it to be no\r\ngrander than those of the neighbors. Their politics were not for\r\nmoney-making; each felt it his duty to exalt the commonwealth.\r\n[Footnote: As Horace says:--\r\n\r\n  Privatus illis census erat brevis,\r\n  Commune magnum.]\r\n\r\nBy a conduct honorable toward the Greeks, pious to the gods, brotherlike\r\namong themselves, they justly attained a high prosperity.\r\n\r\nSo fared matters with them under the statesmen I have mentioned. How\r\nfare they with you under the worthies of our time? Is there any likeness\r\nor resemblance? I pass over other topics, on which I could expatiate;\r\nbut observe: in this utter absence of competitors, (Lacedaemonians\r\ndepressed, Thebans employed, none of the rest capable of disputing the\r\nsupremacy with us,) when we might hold our own securely and arbitrate\r\nthe claims of others, we have been deprived of our rightful territory,\r\nand spent above fifteen hundred talents to no purpose; the allies, whom\r\nwe gained in war, these persons have lost in peace, and we have trained\r\nup against ourselves an enemy thus formidable. Or let any one come\r\nforward and tell me, by whose contrivance but ours Philip has grown\r\nstrong. Well, sir, this looks bad, but things at home are better. What\r\nproof can be adduced? The parapets that are whitewashed? The roads that\r\nare repaired? fountains, and fooleries? [Footnote: Jacobs: _und\r\nsolches Geschwatz_. The proceedings of Eubulus are here more\r\nparticularly referred to.] Look at the men of whose statesmanship these\r\nare the fruits. They have risen from beggary to opulence, or from\r\nobscurity to honor; some have made their private houses more splendid\r\nthan the public buildings; and in proportion as the state has declined,\r\ntheir fortunes have been exalted.\r\n\r\nWhat has produced these results? How is it that all went prosperously\r\nthen, and nowgoes wrong? Because anciently the people, having the\r\ncourage to be soldiers, controlled the statesmen, and disposed of all\r\nemoluments; any of the rest was happy to receive from the people his\r\nshare of honor, office, or advantage. Now, contrariwise, the statesmen\r\ndispose of emoluments; through them every thing is done; you the people,\r\nenervated, stripped of treasure and allies, are become as underlings and\r\nhangers-on, happy if these persons dole you out show-money or send you\r\npaltry beeves; [Footnote: Entertainments were frequently given to the\r\npeople after sacrifices, at which a very small part of the victim was\r\ndevoted to the gods, such as the legs and intestines, the rest being\r\nkept for more profane purposes. Tho Athenians were remarkably\r\nextravagant in sacrifices. Demades, ridiculing the donations of public\r\nmeat, compared the republic to an old woman, sitting at home in slippers\r\nand supping her broth. Demosthenes, using the diminutive [Greek:\r\n_boidia_], charges the magistrates with supplying lean and poor\r\noxen, whereas the victims ought to be healthy and large, [Greek:\r\nteleia]. See Virgil, Aen. xi. 739.\r\n\r\n  Hic amor, hoc studium; dum sacra secundus aruspex\r\n  Nuntiet, ac lucos vocet hostia pinguis in altos.]\r\n\r\nand, the unmanliest part of all, you are grateful for receiving your\r\nown. They, cooping you in the city, lead you to your pleasures, and make\r\nyou tame and submissive to their hands. It is impossible, I say, to have\r\na high and noble spirit, while you are engaged in petty and mean\r\nemployments: whatever be the pursuits of men, their characters must be\r\nsimilar. By Ceres, I should not wonder, if I, for mentioning these\r\nthings, suffered more from your resentment than the men who have brought\r\nthem to pass. For even liberty of speech you allow not on all subjects;\r\nI marvel indeed you have allowed it here.\r\n\r\nWould you but even now, renouncing these practices, perform military\r\nservice and act worthily of yourselves; would you employ these domestic\r\nsuperfluities as a means to gain advantage abroad; perhaps, Athenians,\r\nperhaps you might gain some solid and important advantage, and be rid of\r\nthese perquisites, which are like the diet ordered by physicians for the\r\nsick. As that neither imparts strength, nor suffers the patient to die,\r\nso your allowances are not enough to be of substantial benefit, nor yet\r\npermit you to reject them and turn to something else. Thus do they\r\nincrease the general apathy. What? I shall be asked: mean you\r\nstipendiary service? Yes, and forthwith the same arrangement for all,\r\nAthenians, that each, taking his dividend from the public, may be what\r\nthe state requires. Is peace to be had? You are better at home, under no\r\ncompulsion to act dishonorably from indigence. Is there such an\r\nemergency as the present? Better to be a soldier, as you ought, in your\r\ncountry's cause, maintained by those very allowances. Is any one of you\r\nbeyond the military age? What he now irregularly takes without doing\r\nservice, let him take by just regulation, superintending and transacting\r\nneedful business. Thus, without derogating from or adding to our\r\npolitical system, only removing some irregularity, I bring it into\r\norder, establishing a uniform rule for receiving money, for serving in\r\nwar, for sitting on juries, for doing what each according to his age can\r\ndo, and what occasion requires. I never advise we should give to idlers\r\nthe wages of the diligent, or sit at leisure, passive and helpless, to\r\nhear that such a one's mercenaries are victorious; as we now do. Not\r\nthat I blame any one who does you a service: I only call upon you,\r\nAthenians, to perform on your own account those duties for which you\r\nhonor strangers, and not to surrender that post of dignity which, won\r\nthrough many glorious dangers, your ancestors have bequeathed.\r\n\r\nI have said nearly all that I think necessary. I trust you will adopt\r\nthat course which is best for the country and yourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PHILIPPIC.\r\n\r\n  THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  Philip, after the defeat of Onomarchus, had marched toward\r\n  the pass of Thermopylae, which, however, he found occupied by\r\n  the Athenians, who had sent a force for the purpose of\r\n  preventing his advance. Being baffled there, he directed his\r\n  march into Thrace, and alarmed the Athenians for the safety\r\n  of their dominions in the Chersonese. At the same time he sent\r\n  a fleet to attack the islands of Lemnos and Imbrus, infested\r\n  the commerce of Athens with his cruisers, and even insulted\r\n  her coast. In Thrace he became involved in the disputes\r\n  between the rival kings Amadocus and Cersobleptes, espousing\r\n  the cause of the former; and for some time he was engaged in\r\n  the interior of that country, either at war with Cersobleptes,\r\n  or extending his own influence over other parts of Thrace,\r\n  where he established or expelled the rulers, as it suited him.\r\n  It was just at that time that Demosthenes spoke the following\r\n  oration, the first in which he called the attention of his\r\n  countrymen to the dangerous increase of Philip's power. He had\r\n  become convinced by the course of events, and by observing the\r\n  restless activity of Philip, that Athens had more to fear from\r\n  him than from Thebes, or from any new combination of the\r\n  Grecian republics. The orator himself, perhaps, hardly\r\n  appreciated the extent of Philip's resources, strengthened as\r\n  he was now by the friendship of Thessaly, possessed of a navy\r\n  and maritime towns, and relieved from the presence of any\r\n  powerful neighbors. What were the precise views of Demosthenes\r\n  as to the extent of the impending danger, we can not say. It\r\n  was not for him to frighten the Athenians too much, but to\r\n  awaken them from their lethargy. This he does in a speech,\r\n  which, without idle declamation or useless ornament, is\r\n  essentially practical. He alarms, but encourages, his\r\n  countrymen; points out both their weakness and their strength;\r\n  rouses them to a sense of danger, and shows the way to meet it;\r\n  recommends not any extraordinary efforts, for which at the\r\n  moment there was no urgent necessity, and to make which would\r\n  have exceeded their power, but unfolds a scheme, simple and\r\n  feasible, suiting the occasion, and calculated (if Athenians\r\n  had not been too degenerate) to lay the foundation of better things.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the question for debate been any thing new, Athenians, I should have\r\nwaited till most of the usual speakers [Footnote: By an ancient\r\nordinance of Solon, those who were above fifty years of age were first\r\ncalled on to deliver their opinion. The law had ceased to be in force;\r\nbut, as a decent custom, the older men usually commenced the debate.\r\nThere would be frequent occasions for departing from such a custom, and\r\nDemosthenes, who was now thirty-three, assigns his reason for speaking\r\nfirst.] had been heard; if any of their counsels had been to my liking,\r\nI had remained silent, else proceeded to impart my own. But as the\r\nsubjects of discussion is one upon which they have spoken oft before, I\r\nimagine, though I rise the first, I am entitled to indulgence. For if\r\nthese men had advised properly in time past, there would be no necessity\r\nfor deliberating now.\r\n\r\nFirst I say, you must not despond, Athenians, under your present\r\ncircumstances, wretched as they are; for that which is worst in them as\r\nregards the past, is best for the future. What do I mean? That our\r\naffairs are amiss, men of Athens, because you do nothing which is\r\nneedful; if, notwithstanding you performed your duties, it were the\r\nsame, there would be no hope of amendment.\r\n\r\nConsider next, what you know by report, and men of experience remember;\r\nhow vast a power the Lacedaemonians had not long ago, yet how nobly and\r\nbecomingly you consulted the dignity of Athens, and undertook the war\r\n[Footnote: He refers to the war in which Athens assisted the Thebans\r\nagainst Lacedaemon, and in which Chabrias won the naval battle of Naxos.\r\nThat war commenced twenty-six years before the speaking of the first\r\nPhilippic, and would be well remembered by many of the hearers. See the\r\nHistorical Abstract in this volume.] against them for the rights of\r\nGreece. Why do I mention this? To show and convince you, Athenians, that\r\nnothing, if you take precaution, is to be feared, nothing, if you are\r\nnegligent, goes as you desire. Take for examples the strength of the\r\nLacedaemonians then, which you overcame by attention to your duties, and\r\nthe insolence of this man now, by which through neglect of our interests\r\nwe are confounded. But if any among you, Athenians, deem Philip hard to\r\nbe conquered, looking at the magnitude of his existing power, and the\r\nloss by us of all our strongholds, they reason rightly, but should\r\nreflect, that once we held Pydna and Potidaea and Methone and all the\r\nregion round about as our own, and many of the nations now leagued with\r\nhim were independent and free, and preferred our friendship to his. Had\r\nPhilip then taken it into his head, that it was difficult to contend\r\nwith Athens, when she had so many fortresses to infest his country, and\r\nhe was destitute of allies, nothing that he has accomplished would he\r\nhave undertaken, and never would he have acquired so large a dominion.\r\nBut he saw well, Athenians, that all these places are the open prizes of\r\nwar, that the possessions of the absent naturally belong to the present,\r\nthose of the remiss to them that will venture and toil. Acting on such\r\nprinciple, he has won every thing and keeps it, either by way of\r\nconquest, or by friendly attachment and alliance; for all men will side\r\nwith and respect those, whom they see prepared and willing to make\r\nproper exertion. If you, Athenians, will adopt this principle now,\r\nthough you did not before, and every man, where he can and ought to give\r\nhis service to the, state, be ready to give it without excuse, the\r\nwealthy to contribute, the able-bodied to enlist; in a word, plainly, if\r\nyou will become your own masters, and cease each expecting to do nothing\r\nhimself, while his neighbor does every thing for him, you shall then\r\nwith heaven's permission recover your own, and get back what has been\r\nfrittered away, and chastise Philip. Do not imagine, that his empire is\r\neverlastingly secured to him as a god. There are who hate and fear and\r\nenvy him, Athenians, even among those that seem most friendly; and all\r\nfeelings that are in other men belong, we may assume, to his\r\nconfederates. But now they are all cowed, having no refuge through your\r\ntardiness and indolence, which I say you must abandon forthwith. For you\r\nsee, Athenians, the case, to what pitch of arrogance the man has\r\nadvanced, who leaves you not even the choice of action or inaction, but\r\nthreatens and uses (they say) outrageous language, and, unable to rest\r\nin possession of his conquests, continually widens their circle, and,\r\nwhile we dally and delay, throws his net all around us. When then,\r\nAthenians, when will ye act as becomes you? In what event? In that of\r\nnecessity, I suppose. And how should we regard the events happening now?\r\nMethinks, to freemen the strongest necessity is the disgrace of their\r\ncondition. Or tell me, do ye like walking about and asking one\r\nanother:--is there any news? Why, could there be greater news than a man\r\nof Macedonia subduing Athenians, and directing the affairs of Greece? Is\r\nPhilip dead? No, but he is sick. And what matters it to you? Should any\r\nthing befall this man, you will soon create another Philip, if you\r\nattend to business thus. For even he has been exalted not so much by his\r\nown strength, as by our negligence. And again; should any thing happen\r\nto him; should fortune, which still takes better care of us than we of\r\nourselves, be good enough to accomplish this; observe that, being on the\r\nspot, you would step in while things were in confusion, and manage them\r\nas you pleased; but as you now are, though occasion offered Amphipolis,\r\nyou would not be in a position to accept it, with neither forces nor\r\ncounsels at hand. [Footnote: Important advice this, to men in all\r\nrelations of life. Good luck is for those who are in a position to avail\r\nthemselves of it.\r\n\r\n  Illi poma cadunt qui poma sub arbore quaerit.]\r\n\r\nHowever, as to the importance of a general zeal in the discharge of\r\nduty, believing you are convinced and satisfied, I say no more.\r\n\r\nAs to the kind of force which I think may extricate you from your\r\ndifficulties, the amount, the supplies of money, the best and speediest\r\nmethod (in my judgment) of providing all the necessaries, I shall\r\nendeavor to inform you forthwith, making only one request, men of\r\nAthens. When, you have heard all, determine; prejudge not before. And\r\nlet none think I delay our operations, because I recommend an entirely\r\nnew force. Not those that cry, quickly! to-day! speak most to the\r\npurpose; (for what has already happened we shall not be able to prevent\r\nby our present armament;) but he that shows what and how great and\r\nwhence procured must be the force capable of enduring, till either we\r\nhave advisedly terminated the war, or overcome our enemies: for so shall\r\nwe escape annoyance in future. This I think I am able to show, without\r\noffense to any other man who has a plan to offer. My promise indeed is\r\nlarge; it shall be tested by the performance; and you shall be my\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, Athenians, I say we must provide fifty warships, [Footnote:\r\nThe Athenian ship of war at this time was the Trireme, or galley with\r\nthree ranks of oars. It had at the prow a beak ([Greek:\r\n_embolon_]), with a sharp iron head, which, in a charge, (generally\r\nmade at the broadside,) was able to shatter the planks of the enemy's\r\nvessel. An ordinary trireme carried two hundred men, including the crew\r\nand marines. These last ([Greek: _epibatai_]) were usually ten for\r\neach ship, but the number was often increased. The transports and\r\nvessels of burden, whether merchant vessels or boats for the carriage of\r\nmilitary stores, were round-bottomed, more bulky in construction, and\r\nmoved rather with sails than oars. Hence the fighting ship is called\r\n[Greek: _tacheia_], _swift_. It carried a sail, to be used\r\nupon occasion, though it was mainly worked with oars.] and hold\r\nourselves prepared, in case of emergency, to embark and sail. I require\r\nalso an equipment of transports for half the cavalry [Footnote: The\r\ntotal number was one thousand, each tribe furnishing one hundred.] and\r\nsufficient boats. This we must have ready against his sudden, marches\r\nfrom his own country to Thermopylae, the Chersonese, Olynthus, and any\r\nwhere he likes. For he should entertain the belief, that possibly you\r\nmay rouse from this over-carelessness, and start off, as you did to\r\nEuboea, [Footnote: The expedition about five years before, when the\r\nThebans had sent an army to Euboea, and Timotheus roused his countrymen\r\nto expel them from the island. Of this, Demosthenes gives an animated\r\naccount at the close of tho oration on the Chersonese.] and formerly\r\n(they say) to Haliartus, [Footnote: B. C. 395, when the war between\r\nThebes and Sparta had begun and Lysander besieged Haliartus. He was\r\nslain in a sally by the Thebans and Athenians.] and very lately to\r\nThermopylae. And although you should not pursue just the course I would\r\nadvise, it is no slight matter, that Philip, knowing you to be in\r\nreadiness--know it he will for certain; there are too many among our own\r\npeople who report every thing to him--may either keep quiet from\r\napprehension, or, not heeding your arrangements, be taken off his guard,\r\nthere being nothing to prevent your sailing, if he give you a chance, to\r\nattack his territories. Such an armament, I say, ought instantly to be\r\nagreed upon and provided. But besides, men of Athens, you should keep in\r\nhand some force, that will incessantly make war and annoy him: none of\r\nyour ten or twenty thousand mercenaries, not your forces on paper,\r\n[Footnote: Literally \"written in letters,\" that is, promised to the\r\ngenerals or allies, but never sent. Jacobs: _eine Macht die auf dem\r\nBlatte steht_. Compare Shakspeare, Henry IV, Second Part, Act i.\r\n\r\n  We fortify in paper and in figures.\r\n  Using the names of men instead of men.]\r\n\r\nbut one that shall belong to the state, and, whether you appoint one or\r\nmore generals, or this or that man or any other, shall obey and follow\r\nhim. Subsistence too I require for it. What the force shall be, how\r\nlarge, from what source maintained, how rendered efficient, I will show\r\nyou, stating every particular. Mercenaries I recommend--and beware of\r\ndoing what has often been injurious--thinking all measures below the\r\noccasion, adopting the strongest in your decrees, you fail to accomplish\r\nthe least--rather, I say, perform and procure a little, add to it\r\nafterward, if it prove insufficient. I advise then two thousand soldiers\r\nin all, five hundred to be Athenians, of whatever age you think right,\r\nserving a limited time, not long, but such time as you think right, so\r\nas to relieve one another; the rest should be mercenaries. And with them\r\ntwo hundred horse, fifty at least Athenians, like the foot, on the same\r\nterms of service; and transports for them. Well; what besides? Ten swift\r\ngalleys: for, as Philip has a navy, we must have swift galleys also, to\r\nconvoy our power. How shall subsistence for these troops be provided? I\r\nwill state and explain; but first let me tell you why I consider a force\r\nof this amount sufficient, and why I wish the men to be citizens.\r\n\r\nOf that amount, Athenians, because it is impossible for us now to raise\r\nan army capable of meeting him in the field: we must plunder [Footnote:\r\nMake predatory incursions, as Livy says, \"popula bundi magis quam justo\r\nmore belli.\" Jacobs: _den Krieg als Freibeuter fahren_. Another\r\nGerman: _Streifzuge zu machen_ (guerilla warfare). Leland: \"harass\r\nhim with depredations.\" Wilson, an old English translator: \"rob and\r\nspoil upon him.\"] and adopt such kind of warfare at first: our force,\r\ntherefore, must not be over-large, (for there is not pay or\r\nsubsistence,) nor altogether mean. Citizens I wish to attend and go on\r\nboard, because I hear that formerly the state maintained mercenary\r\ntroops at Corinth, [Footnote: He alludes to the time when Corinth,\r\nAthens, Thebes, and Argos, were allied against Sparta, and held a\r\ncongress at Corinth, B. C. 394. The allies were at first defeated, but\r\nIphicrates gained some successes, and acquired considerable reputation\r\nby cutting off a small division (_mora_) of Spartan infantry.]\r\ncommanded by Polystratus and Iphicrates and Chabrias and some others,\r\nand that you served with them yourselves; and I am told, that these\r\nmercenaries fighting by your side and you by theirs defeated the\r\nLacedaemonians. But ever since your hirelings have served by themselves,\r\nthey have been vanquishing your friends and allies, while your enemies\r\nhave become unduly great. Just glancing at the war of our state, they go\r\noff to Artabazus [Footnote: Diodorus relates that Chares, in the Social\r\nwar, having no money to pay his troops, was forced to lend them to\r\nArtabazus, then in rebellion against the king of Persia. Chares gained a\r\nvictory for the satrap, and received a supply of money. But this led to\r\na complaint and menace of war by the king, which brought serious\r\nconsequences. See the Historical Abstract.] or any where rather, and the\r\ngeneral follows, naturally; for it is impossible to command without\r\ngiving pay. What therefore ask I? To remove the excuses both of general\r\nand soldiers, by supplying pay, and attaching native soldiers, as\r\ninspectors of the general's conduct. The way we manage things now is a\r\nmockery. For if you were asked: Are you at peace, Athenians? No, indeed,\r\nyou would say; we are at war with Philip. Did you not choose from\r\nyourselves ten captains and generals, and also captains and two generals\r\n[Footnote: There were chosen at Athens every year\r\n\r\n  Ten generals (one for each tribe), [Greek: _strataegoi_].\r\n  Ten captains (one for each tribe), [Greek: _taxiarchoi_].\r\n  Two generals of cavalry, [Greek: _ipparchoi_].\r\n  Ten cavalry officers (one for each tribe), [Greek: _phularchoi_].\r\n\r\nIn a regular army of citizens, when each tribe formed its own division,\r\nboth of horse and foot, all these generals and officers would he\r\npresent. Thus, there were ten generals at Marathon. A change took place\r\nin later times, when the armies were more miscellaneous. Three Athenian\r\ngenerals were frequently employed, and at a still later period only one.\r\nDemosthenes here touches on a very important matter, which we can well\r\nunderstand, viz. the necessity of officering the foreign mercenaries\r\nfrom home.] of horse? How are they employed? Except one man, whom you\r\ncommission on service abroad, the rest conduct your processions with the\r\nsacrificers. Like puppet-makers, you elect your infantry and cavalry\r\nofficers for the market-place, not for war. Consider, Athenians, should\r\nthere not be native captains, a native general of horse, your own\r\ncommanders, that the force might really be the state's? Or should your\r\ngeneral of horse sail to Lemnos, [Footnote: To assist at a religious\r\nceremony held annually at Lemnos, where many Athenians resided.] while\r\nMenelaus commands the cavalry fighting for your possessions? I speak not\r\nas objecting to the man, but he ought to be elected by you, whoever the\r\nperson be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you admit the justice of these statements, but wish principally\r\nto hear about the supplies, what they must be and whence procured. I\r\nwill satisfy you. Supplies, then, for maintenance, mere rations for\r\nthese troops, come to ninety talents and a little more: for ten swift\r\ngalleys forty talents, twenty minas a month to every ship; for two\r\nthousand soldiers forty more, that each soldier may receive for rations\r\nten drachms a month; and for two hundred horsemen, each receiving thirty\r\ndrachms a month, twelve talents. [Footnote: As to Athenian money, see\r\nAppendix II.] Should any one think rations for the men a small\r\nprovision, he judges erroneously. Furnish that, and I am sure the army\r\nitself will, without injuring any Greek or ally, procure every thing\r\nelse from the war, so as to make out their full pay. I am ready to join\r\nthe fleet as a volunteer, and submit to any thing, if this be not so.\r\nNow for the ways and means of the supply, which I demand from you.\r\n\r\n[_Statement of ways and means_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Here the clerk or secretary reads the scheme drawn up by\r\nDemosthenes, in the preparing of which he was probably assisted by the\r\nfinancial officers of the state. What follows was according to\r\nDionysius, spoken at a different time. The curious may consult Leland,\r\nand Jacobs' introduction to his translation.]\r\n\r\nThis, Athenians, is what we have been able to devise. When you vote upon\r\nthe resolutions, pass what you [Footnote: _I. e._ some measure, if\r\nnot mine, whereby the war may be waged effectually. The reading of\r\n[Greek: _poiaesate_], adopted by Jacobs after Schaefer, is not in\r\ncongruity with the sentence.] approve, that you may oppose Philip, not\r\nonly by decrees and letters, but by action also.\r\n\r\nI think it will assist your deliberations about the war and the whole\r\narrangements, to regard the position, Athenians, of the hostile country,\r\nand consider, that Philip by the winds and seasons of the year gets the\r\nstart in most of his operations, watching for the trade-winds [Footnote:\r\nThe Etesian winds blowing from the northwest in July, which would impede\r\na voyage from Athens to Macedonia and Thrace.] or the winter to commence\r\nthem, when we are unable (he thinks) to reach the spot. On this account,\r\nwe must carry on the war not with hasty levies, (or we shall be too late\r\nfor every thing,) but with a permanent force and power. You may use as\r\nwinter quarters for your troops Lemnos, and Thasus, and Sciathus, and\r\nthe islands [Footnote: As Scopelus, Halonnesus, Peparethus, which were\r\nthen subject to Athens.] in that neighborhood, which have harbors and\r\ncorn and all necessaries for an army. In the season of the year, when it\r\nis easy to put ashore and there is no danger from the winds, they will\r\neasily take their station off the coast itself and at the entrances of\r\nthe sea-ports.\r\n\r\nHow and when to employ the troops, the commander appointed by you will\r\ndetermine as occasion requires. What you must find, is stated in my\r\nbill. If, men of Athens, you will furnish the supplies which I mention,\r\nand then, after completing your preparations of soldiers, ships,\r\ncavalry, will oblige the entire force by law to remain in the service,\r\nand, while you become your own paymasters and commissaries, demand from\r\nyour general an account of his conduct, you will cease to be always\r\ndiscussing the same questions without forwarding them in the least, and\r\nbesides, Athenians, not only will you cut off his greatest revenue--What\r\nis this? He maintains war against you through the resources of your\r\nallies, by his piracies on their navigation--But what next? You will be\r\nout of the reach of injury yourselves: he will not do as in time past,\r\nwhen falling upon Lemnos and Imbrus he carried off your citizens\r\ncaptive, seizing the vessels at Geraestus he levied an incalculable sum,\r\nand lastly, made a descent at Marathon and carried off the sacred galley\r\n[Footnote: A ship called Paralus generally used on religious missions or\r\nto carry public dispatches.] from our coast, and you could neither\r\nprevent these things nor send succors by the appointed time. But how is\r\nit, think you, Athenians, that the Panathenaic and Dionysian festivals\r\n[Footnote: The Panathenaic festivals were in honor of Pallas or Athene,\r\nthe protectress of Athens, and commemorated also the union of the old\r\nAttic towns under one government. There were two, the greater held every\r\nfourth year, the lesser annually. They were celebrated with sacrifices,\r\nraces, gymnastic and musical contests, and various other amusements and\r\nsolemnities, among which was the carrying the pictured robe of Pallas to\r\nher temple. The Dionysia, or festival of Bacchus, will be spoken of more\r\nfully hereafter.] take place always at the appointed time, whether\r\nexpert or unqualified persons be chosen to conduct either of them,\r\nwhereon you expend larger sums than upon any armament, and which are\r\nmore numerously attended and magnificent than almost any thing in the\r\nworld; while all your armaments are after the time, as that to Methone,\r\nto Pagasae, to Potidaea? Because in the former case every thing is\r\nordered by law, and each of you knows long before-hand, who is the\r\nchoir-master [Footnote: The choregus, or choir-master, of each tribe,\r\nhad to defray the expense of the choruses, whether dramatic, lyric, or\r\nmusical, which formed part of the entertainment on solemn occasions.\r\nThis was one of the [Greek: _leitourgiai_], or burdensome offices,\r\nto which men of property were liable at Athens, of which we shall see\r\nmore in other parts of our author.] of his tribe, who the gymnastic\r\n[Footnote: The gymnasiarch, like the choregus, had a burden imposed on\r\nhim by his tribe, to make certain provisions for the gymnasium, public\r\nplace or school of exercise. Some of the contests at the festivals being\r\nof a gymnastic nature, such as the Torch-race, it was his duty to make\r\narrangements for them, and more particularly to select the ablest youths\r\nof the school for performers.] master, when, from whom, and what he is\r\nto receive, and what to do. Nothing there is left unascertained or\r\nundefined: whereas in the business of war and its preparations all is\r\nirregular, unsettled, indefinite. Therefore, no sooner have we heard any\r\nthing, than we appoint ship-captains, dispute with them on the\r\nexchanges, [Footnote: For every ship of war a captain, or trierarch, was\r\nappointed, whose duty it was, not merely to command, but take charge of\r\nthe vessel, keep it in repair, and bear the expense (partly or wholly)\r\nof equipping it. In the Peloponnesian war we find the charge laid upon\r\ntwo joint captains, and afterward it was borne by an association formed\r\nlike the Symmoriae of the Property Tax. Demosthenes, when he came to the\r\nhead of affairs, introduced some useful reforms in the system of the\r\nTrierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe exchange, [Greek: _antidosis_], was a stringent but clumsy\r\ncontrivance, to enforce the performance of these public duties by\r\npersons capable of bearing them. A party charged might call upon any\r\nother person to take take the office, or exchange estates with him. If\r\nhe refused, complaint was made to the magistrate who had cognizance of\r\nthe business, and the dispute was judicially heard and decided.] and\r\nconsider about ways and means; then it is resolved that resident aliens\r\nand householders [Footnote: Freedmen, who had quitted their masters'\r\nhouse, and lived independently.] shall embark, then to put yourselves on\r\nboard instead: but during these days the objects of our expedition are\r\nlost; for the time of action we waste in preparation, and favorable\r\nmoments wait not our evasions and delays. The forces that we imagine we\r\npossess in the mean time, are found, when the crisis comes, utterly\r\ninsufficient. And Philip has arrived at such a pitch of arrogance, as to\r\nsend the following letter to the Euboeans:\r\n\r\n[_The letter is read_.]\r\n\r\nOf that which has been read, Athenians, most is true, unhappily true;\r\nperhaps not agreeable to hear. And if what one passes over in speaking,\r\nto avoid offense, one could pass over in reality, it is right to humor\r\nthe audience; but if graciousness of speech, where it is out of place,\r\ndoes harm in action, shameful is it, Athenians, to delude ourselves, and\r\nby putting off every thing unpleasant to miss the time for all\r\noperations, and be unable even to understand, that skillful makers of\r\nwar should not follow circumstances, but be in advance of them; that\r\njust as a general may be expected to lead his armies, so are men of\r\nprudent counsel to guide circumstances, in order that their resolutions\r\nmay be accomplished, not their motions determined by the event. Yet you,\r\nAthenians, with larger means than any people--ships, infantry, cavalry,\r\nand revenue--have never up to this day made proper use of any of them;\r\nand your war with Philip differs in no respect from the boxing of\r\nbarbarians. For among them the party struck feels always for the blow;\r\n[Footnote: Compare Virgil, Aen. ix 577.\r\n\r\n      Ille manum projecto tegmine demens\r\n  Ad vulnus tulit.]\r\n\r\nstrike him somewhere else, there go his hands again; ward or look in the\r\nface he can not nor will. So you, if you hear of Philip in the\r\nChersonese, vote to send relief there if at Thermopylae, the same; if\r\nany where else, you run after his heels up and down, and are commanded\r\nby him; no plan have you devised for the war, no circumstance do you see\r\nbeforehand, only [Footnote: This loose mode of expression, which is\r\nfound in the original, I designedly retain.] when you learn that\r\nsomething is done, or about to be done. Formerly perhaps this was\r\nallowable: now it is come to a crisis, to be tolerable no longer. And it\r\nseems, men of Athens, as if some god, ashamed for us at our proceedings,\r\nhas put this activity into Philip. For had he been willing to remain\r\nquiet in possession of his conquests and prizes, and attempted nothing\r\nfurther, some of you, I think, would be satisfied with a state of\r\nthings, which brands our nation with the shame of cowardice and the\r\nfoulest disgrace. But by continually encroaching and grasping after\r\nmore, he may possibly rouse you, if you have not altogether despaired. I\r\nmarvel, indeed, that none of you, Athenians, notices with concern and\r\nanger, that the beginning of this war was to chastise Philip, the end is\r\nto protect ourselves against his attacks. One thing is clear: he will\r\nnot stop, unless some one oppose him. And shall we wait for this? And if\r\nyou dispatch empty galleys and hopes from this or that person, think ye\r\nall is well? Shall we not embark? Shall we not sail with at least a part\r\nof our national forces, now though not before? Shall we not make a\r\ndescent upon his coast? Where, then, shall we land? some one asks. The\r\nwar itself, men of Athens, will discover the rotten parts of his empire,\r\nif we make a trial; but if we sit at home, hearing the orators accuse\r\nand malign one another, no good can ever be achieved. Methinks, where a\r\nportion of our citizens, though not all, are commissioned with the rest,\r\nHeaven blesses, and Fortune aids the struggle: but where you send out a\r\ngeneral and an empty decree and hopes from the hustings, nothing that\r\nyou desire is done; your enemies scoff, and your allies die for fear of\r\nsuch an armament. For it is impossible--ay, impossible, for one man to\r\nexecute all your wishes: to promise, [Footnote: Chares is particularly\r\nalluded to. The \"promises of Chares\" passed into a proverb.] and assert,\r\nand accuse this or that person, is possible; but so your affairs are\r\nruined. The general commands wretched unpaid hirelings; here are persons\r\neasily found, who tell you lies of his conduct; you vote at random from\r\nwhat you hear: what then can be expected?\r\n\r\nHow is this to cease, Athenians? When you make the same persons\r\nsoldiers, and witnesses of the generals conduct, and judges when they\r\nreturn home at his audit; [Footnote: The audit or scrutiny of his\r\nconduct which every officer of the republic had to undergo, before a\r\njury, if necessary, at the end of his administration. In the case of a\r\ngeneral, the scrutiny would be like a court-martial. The Athenian\r\npeople, (says Demosthenes,) as represented by the citizen soldiers,\r\nwould themselves be witnesses of the general's conduct. These same\r\nsoldiers, when they came home, or at least a portion of them, might\r\nserve on the jury; and so the people would be both witnesses and\r\njudges.] so that you may not only hear of your own affairs, but be\r\npresent to see them. So disgraceful is our condition now, that every\r\ngeneral is twice or thrice tried [Footnote: Chares was tried several\r\ntimes. Capital charges were preferred also against Autocles,\r\nCephisodotus, Leosthenes, Callisthenes.] before you for his life, though\r\nnone dares even once to hazard his life against the enemy: they prefer\r\nthe death of kidnappers and thieves to that which becomes them; for it\r\nis a malefactor's part to die by sentence of the law, a general's to die\r\nin battle. Among ourselves, some go about and say that Philip is\r\nconcerting with the Lacedaemonians the destruction of Thebes and the\r\ndissolution of republics; some, that he has sent envoys to the king;\r\n[Footnote: The king of Persia, generally called _the king_ by the\r\nGreeks.] others, that he is fortifying cities in Illyria: so we wander\r\nabout, each inventing stories. For my part, Athenians, by the gods I\r\nbelieve, that Philip is intoxicated with the magnitude of his exploits,\r\nand has many such dreams in his imagination, seeing the absence of\r\nopponents, and elated by success; but most certainly he has no such plan\r\nof action, as to let the silliest people among us know what his\r\nintentions are; for the silliest are these newsmongers. Let us dismiss\r\nsuch talk, and remember only that Philip is an enemy, who robs us of our\r\nown and has long insulted us; that wherever we have expected aid from\r\nany quarter, it has been found hostile, and that the future depends on\r\nourselves, and unless we are willing to fight him there, we shall\r\nperhaps be compelled to fight here. This let us remember, and then we\r\nshall have determined wisely, and have done with idle conjectures. You\r\nneed not pry into the future, but assure yourselves it will be\r\ndisastrous, unless you attend to your duty, and are willing to act as\r\nbecomes you.\r\n\r\nAs for me, never before have I courted favor, by speaking what I am not\r\nconvinced is for your good, and now I have spoken my whole mind frankly\r\nand unreservedly. I could have wished, knowing the advantage of good\r\ncounsel to you, I were equally certain of its advantage to the\r\ncounselor: so should I have spoken with more satisfaction. Now, with an\r\nuncertainty of the consequence to myself, but with a conviction that you\r\nwill benefit by adopting it, I proffer my advice. I trust only, that\r\nwhat is most for the common benefit will prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PHILIPPIC.\r\n\r\n  THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  Soon after the close of the Phocian war, the attention of\r\n  Philip was called to Peloponnesus, where the dissensions\r\n  between Sparta and her old enemies afforded him an occasion\r\n  of interference. The Spartans had never abandoned their right\r\n  to the province of Messenia, which had been wrested from them\r\n  by Epaminondas; and since Thebes was no longer to be feared,\r\n  they seem to have conceived hopes of regaining their lost\r\n  power. The Argives and the Arcadians of Megalopolis were in\r\n  league with Messenia, but Sparta had her allies in the\r\n  Peloponnesus, and even Athens was suspected of favoring her\r\n  cause. It does not appear that any open hostilities had taken\r\n  place; but about this time the fears of the Messenians induced\r\n  them to solicit the alliance of Philip. He willingly promised\r\n  them his protection, and sent a body of troops into the\r\n  Peninsula. The progress which Macedonian influence was making\r\n  there having alarmed the Athenians, they sent Demosthenes with\r\n  an embassy to counteract it. He went to Messene and to Argos,\r\n  addressed the people, and pointed out the dangers, to which\r\n  all Greece was exposed by Philip's ambition. It seems that he\r\n  failed in rousing their suspicions, or they were too much\r\n  occupied by an immediate peril to heed one that appeared\r\n  remote. Philip however resented this proceeding on the part of\r\n  the Athenians, and sent an embassy to expostulate with them,\r\n  especially on the charge of bad faith and treachery which had\r\n  been preferred against him by Demosthenes. Embassadors from\r\n  Argos and Messene accompanied those of Macedon, and complained\r\n  of the connection that appeared to subsist between Athens\r\n  and Lacedaemon, hostile (they thought) to the liberties of\r\n  Peloponnesus. In answer to these complaints, Demosthenes\r\n  addressed his second Philippic to the Popular Assembly;\r\n  repeating the substance of what he had said to the\r\n  Peloponnesians, vindicating his own conduct, and denouncing\r\n  the Macedonian party at Athens. The embassy led to no immediate\r\n  result; but the influence of Demosthenes at home was increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the speeches, men of Athens, about Philip's measures and\r\ninfringements of the peace, I observe that statements made on our behalf\r\nare thought just and generous, [Footnote: _Generous_, as regards\r\nthe Greek states, whose independence the Athenians stand up for. This\r\npraise Demosthenes frequently claims for his countrymen, and, compared\r\nwith the rest of the Greeks, they deserved it. Leland understood the\r\nword [Greek: _philanthropous_] in the same sense, though he\r\ntranslates it _humane_. We use the term _philanthropic_ in a\r\nsense not unlike that of the orator; but, as Leland truly observes, \"the\r\ndistinction of Greek and barbarian precluded the rest of mankind from a\r\njust share in Grecian philanthropy;\" and he might have added, that their\r\nnotions of slavery were not in accordance with an enlarged humanity.\r\nTherefore, I prefer a word of a less arrogant meaning. Jacobs:\r\n_billig_. Francis: \"filled with sentiments of exceeding\r\nmoderation.\"] and all who accuse Philip are heard with approbation; yet\r\nnothing (I may say) that is proper, or for the sake of which the\r\nspeeches are worth hearing, is done. To this point are the affairs of\r\nAthens brought, that the more fully and clearly one convicts Philip of\r\nviolating the peace with you, and plotting against the whole of Greece,\r\nthe more difficult it becomes to advise you how to act. The cause lies\r\nin all of us, Athenians, that, when we ought to oppose an ambitious\r\npower by deeds and actions, not by words, we men of the hustings\r\n[Footnote: Auger has: \"nous qui montons a la tribune.\"] shrink from our\r\nduty of moving and advising, for fear of your displeasure, and only\r\ndeclaim on the heinousness and atrocity of Philip's conduct; you of the\r\nassembly, though better instructed than Philip to argue justly, or\r\ncomprehend the argument of another, to check him in the execution of his\r\ndesigns are totally unprepared. The result is inevitable, I imagine, and\r\nperhaps just. You each succeed better in what you are busy and earnest\r\nabout; Philip in actions, you in words. If you are still satisfied with\r\nusing the better arguments, it is an easy matter, and there is no\r\ntrouble: but if we are to take measures for the correction of these\r\nevils, to prevent their insensible progress, and the rising up of a\r\nmighty power, against which we could have no defense, then our course of\r\ndeliberation is not the same as formerly; the orators, and you that hear\r\nthem, must prefer good and salutary counsels to those which are easy and\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nFirst, men of Athens, if any one regards without uneasiness the might\r\nand dominion of Philip, and imagines that it threatens no danger to the\r\nstate, or that all his preparations are not against you, I marvel, and\r\nwould entreat you every one to hear briefly from me the reasons, why I\r\nam led to form a contrary expectation, and wherefore I deem Philip an\r\nenemy; that, if I appear to have the clearer foresight, you may hearken\r\nto me; if they, who have such confidence and trust in Philip, you may\r\ngive your adherence to them.\r\n\r\nThus then I reason, Athenians. What did Philip first make himself master\r\nof after the peace? Thermopylae and the Phocian state. Well, and how\r\nused he his power? He chose to act for the benefit of Thebes, not of\r\nAthens. Why so? Because, I conceive, measuring his calculations by\r\nambition, by his desire of universal empire, without regard to peace,\r\nquiet, or justice, he saw plainly, that to a people of our character and\r\nprinciples nothing could he offer or give, that would induce you for\r\nself-interest to sacrifice any of the Greeks to him. He sees that you,\r\nhaving respect for justice, dreading the infamy of the thing, and\r\nexercising proper forethought, would oppose him in any such attempt as\r\nmuch as if you were at war: but the Thebans he expected (and events\r\nprove him right) would, in return for the services done them, allow him\r\nin every thing else to have his way, and, so far from thwarting or\r\nimpeding him, would fight on his side if he required it. From the same\r\npersuasion he befriended lately the Messenians and Argives, which is the\r\nhighest panegyric upon you, Athenians; for you are adjudged by these\r\nproceedings to be the only people incapable of betraying for lucre the\r\nnational rights of Greece, or bartering your attachment to her for any\r\nobligation or benefit. And this opinion of you, that (so different) of\r\nthe Argives and Thebans, he has naturally formed, not only from a view\r\nof present times, but by reflection on the past. For assuredly he finds\r\nand hears that your ancestors, who might have governed the rest of\r\nGreece on terms of submitting to Persia, not only spurned the proposal,\r\nwhen Alexander, [Footnote: Alexander of Macedon, son of Amyntas, was\r\nsent by Mardonius, the Persian commander, to offer the most favorable\r\nterms to the Athenians, if they would desert the cause of the Greeks.\r\nThe Spartans at the same time sent an embassy, to remind them of their\r\nduty. The spirited reply which the Athenians made to both embassies is\r\nrelated by Herodotus. The Thebans submitted to Xerxes, and fought\r\nagainst the Greeks at the battle of Plataea. The Argives were neutral,\r\nchiefly from jealousy of Sparta. They demanded half the command of the\r\nallied army, as a condition of their assistance, but this could not be\r\ncomplied with.] this man's ancestor, came as herald to negotiate, but\r\npreferred to abandon their country and endure any suffering, and\r\nthereafter achieved such exploits as all the world loves to mention,\r\nthough none could ever speak them worthily, and therefore I must be\r\nsilent; for their deeds are too mighty to be uttered [Footnote: The\r\nsimple [Greek: _eipein_] in the original is more forcible than if\r\nit had been [Greek: _epainein_], or the like. Compare Shakspeare,\r\nCoriolanus, Act ii. sc. 2.\r\n\r\n  I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus\r\n  Should not be uttered feebly----\r\n                          For this last\r\n  Before and in Corioli, let me say,\r\n  I can not speak him home.]\r\n\r\nin words. But the forefathers of the Argives and Thebans, they either\r\njoined the barbarian's army, or did not oppose it; and therefore he\r\nknows that both will selfishly embrace their advantage, without\r\nconsidering the common interest of the Greeks. He thought then, if he\r\nchose your friendship, it must be on just principles; if he attached\r\nhimself to them he should find auxiliaries of his ambition. This is the\r\nreason of his preferring them to you both then and now. For certainly he\r\ndoes not see them with a larger navy than you, nor has he acquired an\r\ninland empire and renounced that of the sea and the ports, nor does he\r\nforget the professions and promises on which he obtained the peace.\r\n\r\nWell, it may be said, he knew all this, yet he so acted, not from\r\nambition or the motives which I charge, but because the demands of the\r\nThebans were more equitable than yours. Of all pleas, this now is the\r\nleast open to him. He that bids the Lacedaemonians resign Messene, how\r\ncan he pretend, when he delivered Orchomenos and Coronea to the Thebans,\r\nto have acted on a conviction of justice?\r\n\r\nBut, forsooth, he was compelled,--this plea remains--he made concessions\r\nagainst his will, being surrounded by Thessalian horse and Theban\r\ninfantry. Excellent! So of his intentions they talk; he will mistrust\r\nthe Thebans; and some carry news about, that he will fortify Elatea. All\r\nthis he intends and will intend I dare say; but to attack the\r\nLacedaemonians on behalf of Messene and Argos he does not intend; he\r\nactually sends mercenaries and money into the country, and is expected\r\nhimself with a great force. The Lacedaemonians, who are enemies of\r\nThebes, he overthrows; the Phocians, whom he himself before destroyed,\r\nwill he now preserve?\r\n\r\nAnd who can believe this? I can not think that Philip, either if he was\r\nforced into his former measures, or if he were now giving up the\r\nThebans, would pertinaciously oppose their enemies; his present conduct\r\nrather shows that he adopted those measures by choice. All things prove\r\nto a correct observer, that his whole plan of action is against our\r\nstate. And this has now become to him a sort of necessity. Consider. He\r\ndesires empire: he conceives you to be his only opponents. He has been\r\nfor some time wronging you, as his own conscience best informs him,\r\nsince, by retaining what belongs to you, he secures the rest of his\r\ndominion: had he given up Amphipolis and Potidaea, he deemed himself\r\nunsafe at home. He knows therefore, both that he is plotting against\r\nyou, and that you are aware of it; and, supposing you to have\r\nintelligence, he thinks you must hate him; he is alarmed, expecting some\r\ndisaster, if you get the chance, unless he hastes to prevent you.\r\nTherefore he is awake, and on the watch against us; he courts certain\r\npeople, Thebans, and people in Peloponnesus of the like views, who from\r\ncupidity, he thinks, will be satisfied with the present, and from\r\ndullness of understanding will foresee none of the consequences. And yet\r\nmen of even moderate sense might notice striking facts, which I had\r\noccasion to quote to the Messenians and Argives, and perhaps it is\r\nbetter they should be repeated to you.\r\n\r\nYe, men of Messene, said I, how do ye think the Olynthians would have\r\nbrooked to hear any thing against Philip at those times, when he\r\nsurrendered to them Anthemus, which all former kings of Macedonia\r\nclaimed, when he cast out the Athenian colonists and gave them Potidaea,\r\ntaking on himself your enmity, and giving them the land to enjoy? Think\r\nye they expected such treatment as they got, or would have believed it\r\nif they had been told? Nevertheless, said I, they, after enjoying for a\r\nshort time the land of others, are for a long time deprived by him of\r\ntheir own, shamefully expelled, not only vanquished, but betrayed by one\r\nanother and sold. In truth, these too close connections with despots are\r\nnot safe for republics. The Thessalians, again, think ye, said I, when\r\nhe ejected their tyrants, and gave back Nicaea and Magnesia, they\r\nexpected to have the decemvirate [Footnote: Thessaly was anciently\r\ndivided into four districts, each called a _tetras_, and this, as\r\nwe learn from the third Philippic, was restored soon after the\r\ntermination of the Sacred war. The object of Philip in effecting this\r\narrangement was, no doubt, to weaken the influence of the great\r\nThessalian families by a division of power; otherwise the Pheraean\r\ntyranny might have been exchanged for an oligarchy powerful enough to be\r\nindependent of Macedonia. The decemvirate here spoken of (if the text be\r\ncorrect) was a further contrivance to forward Philip's views; whether we\r\nadopt Leland's opinion, that each tetrarchy was governed by a council of\r\nten, or Schaefer's, that each city was placed under ten governors.\r\nJacobs understands the word _decemvirate_ not to refer to any\r\npositive form of government, but generally to designate a\r\n_tyranny_, such as that which the Lacedaemonians used to introduce\r\ninto conquered cities. So, for example, the Romans might have spoken of\r\na decemvirate after the time of Appius. However this be, Philip seems to\r\nhave contrived that the ruling body, whether in the tetrarchy or the\r\ndecadarchy, should be his own creatures. Two of them, Eudicus and Simus,\r\nare particularly mentioned by Demosthenes as traitors.] which is now\r\nestablished? or that he who restored the meeting at Pylae [Footnote:\r\n_Pylae_, which signifies _gates_, was a name applied by the\r\nGreeks to divers passes, or defiles, but especially to the pass of\r\n_Thermopylae_, which opened through the ridges of Mount Oeta into\r\nthe country of the Epicnemidian Locrians, and was so called from the hot\r\nsulphureous springs that gushed from the foot of the mountain.] would\r\ntake away their revenues? Surely not. And yet these things have\r\noccurred, as all mankind may know. You behold Philip, I said, a\r\ndispenser of gifts and promises: pray, if you are wise, that you may\r\nnever know him for a cheat and a deceiver. By Jupiter, I said, there are\r\nmanifold contrivances for the guarding and defending of cities, as\r\nramparts, walls, trenches, and the like: these are all made with hands,\r\nand require expense; but there is one common safeguard in the nature of\r\nprudent men, which is a good security for all, but especially for\r\ndemocracies against despots. What do I mean? Mistrust. Keep this, hold\r\nto this; preserve this only, and you can never be injured. What do ye\r\ndesire? Freedom. Then see ye not that Philip's very titles are at\r\nvariance therewith? Every king and despot is a foe to freedom, an\r\nantagonist to laws. Will ye not beware, I said, lest, seeking\r\ndeliverance from war, you find a master?\r\n\r\nThey heard me with a tumult of approbation; and many other speeches they\r\nheard from the ambassadors, both in my presence and afterward; yet none\r\nthe more, as it appears, will they keep aloof from Philip's friendship\r\nand promises. And no wonder, that Messenians and certain Peloponnesians\r\nshould act contrary to what their reason approves; but you, who\r\nunderstand yourselves, and by us orators are told, how you are plotted\r\nagainst, how you are inclosed! you, I fear, to escape present exertion,\r\nwill come to ruin ere you are aware. So doth the moment's case and\r\nindulgence prevail over distant advantage.\r\n\r\nAs to your measures, you will in prudence, I presume, consult hereafter\r\nby yourselves. I will furnish you with such an answer as it becomes the\r\nassembly to decide upon.\r\n\r\n[_Here the proposed answer was read_]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Whether this was moved by the orator himself, or formally\r\nread as his motion by the officer of the assembly, does not appear.]\r\n\r\nIt were just, men of Athens, to call the persons who brought those\r\npromises, on the faith whereof you concluded peace. For I should never\r\nhave submitted to go as ambassador, and you would certainly not have\r\ndiscontinued the war, had you supposed that Philip, on obtaining peace,\r\nwould act thus; but the statements then made were very different. Ay,\r\nand others you should call. Whom? The men who declared--after the peace,\r\nwhen I had returned from my second mission, that for the oaths, when,\r\nperceiving your delusion, I gave warning, and protested, and opposed the\r\nabandonment of Thermopylae and the Phocians--that I, being a\r\nwater-drinker, [Footnote: It was Philocrates who said this. There were\r\nmany jokes against Demosthenes as a water-drinker.] was naturally a\r\nchurlish and morose fellow, that Philip, if he passed the straits, would\r\ndo just as you desired, fortify Thespiae and Plataea, humble the\r\nThebans, cut through the Chersonese [Footnote: This peninsula being\r\nexposed to incursions from Thrace, a plan was conceived of cutting\r\nthrough the isthmus from Pteleon to Leuce-Acte, to protect the Athenian\r\nsettlements. See the Appendix to this volume, on the Thracian\r\nChersonese.] at his own expense, and give you Oropus and Euboea in\r\nexchange for Amphipolis. All these declarations on the hustings I am\r\nsure you remember, though you are not famous for remembering injuries.\r\nAnd, the most disgraceful thing of all, you voted in your confidence,\r\nthat this same peace should descend to your posterity; so completely\r\nwere you misled. Why mention I this now, and desire these men to be\r\ncalled? By the gods, I will tell you the truth frankly and without\r\nreserve. Not that I may fall a-wrangling, to provoke recrimination\r\nbefore you, [Footnote: Similarly Auger: \"Ce n'est pas pour m'attirer les\r\ninvectives de mes anciens adversaires en les invectivant moi-meme.\"\r\nJacobs otherwise: _Nicht um durch Schmahungen mir auf gleiche Weise\r\nGehor bei Euch zu verschaffen_. But I do not think that [Greek:\r\n_emauto logon poiaeso_] can bear the sense of [Greek: _logon\r\ntuchoimi_], \"get a hearing for myself.\" And the orator's object is,\r\nnot so much to sneer at the people by hinting that they are ready to\r\nhear abuse, as to deter his opponents from retaliation, or weaken its\r\neffect, by denouncing their opposition as corrupt. Leland saw the\r\nmeaning: \"Not that, by breaking out into invectives, I may expose myself\r\nto the like treatment.\"] and afford my old adversaries a fresh pretext\r\nfor getting more from Philip, nor for the purpose of idle garrulity. But\r\nI imagine that what Philip is doing will grieve you hereafter more than\r\nit does now. I see the thing progressing, and would that my surmises\r\nwere false; but I doubt it is too near already. So when you are able no\r\nlonger to disregard events, when, instead of hearing from me or others\r\nthat these measures are against Athens, you all see it yourselves, and\r\nknow it for certain, I expect you will be wrathful and exasperated. I\r\nfear then, as your embassadors have concealed the purpose for which they\r\nknow they were corrupted, those who endeavor to repair what the others\r\nhave lost may chance to encounter your resentment; for I see it is a\r\npractice with many to vent their anger, not upon the guilty, but on\r\npersons most in their power. While therefore the mischief is only coming\r\nand preparing, while we hear one another speak, I wish every man, though\r\nhe knows it well, to be reminded, who it was [Footnote: He means\r\nAeschines.] persuaded you to abandon Phocis and Thermopylae, by the\r\ncommand of which Philip commands the road to Attica and Peloponnesus,\r\nand has brought it to this, that your deliberation must be, not about\r\nclaims and interests abroad, but concerning the defense of your home and\r\na war in Attica, which will grieve every citizen when it comes, and\r\nindeed it has commenced from that day. Had you not been then deceived,\r\nthere would be nothing to distress the state. Philip would certainly\r\nnever have prevailed at sea and come to Attica with a fleet, nor would\r\nhe have marched with a land-force by Phocis and Thermopylae: he must\r\neither have acted honorably, observing the peace and keeping quiet, or\r\nbeen immediately in a war similar to that which made him desire the\r\npeace. Enough has been said to awaken recollection. Grant, O ye gods, it\r\nbe not all fully confirmed! I would have no man punished, though death\r\nhe may deserve, to the damage and danger of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD PHILIPPIC.\r\n\r\n  THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  This speech was delivered about three months after the last,\r\n  while Philip was advancing into Thrace, and threatening both\r\n  the Chersonese and the Propontine coast. No new event had\r\n  happened, which called for any special consultation; but\r\n  Demosthenes, alarmed by the formidable character of Philip's\r\n  enterprises and vast military preparations, felt the necessity\r\n  of rousing the Athenians to exertion. He repeats in substance\r\n  the arguments which he had used in the Oration on the\r\n  Chersonese; points out the danger to be apprehended from the\r\n  disunion among the Greek states, from their general apathy\r\n  and lack of patriotism, which he contrasts with the high and\r\n  noble spirit of ancient times. From the past conduct of Philip\r\n  he shows what is to be expected in future; explains the\r\n  difference between Philip's new method of warfare and that\r\n  adopted in the Peloponnesian war, and urges the necessity of\r\n  corresponding measures for defense. The peaceful professions\r\n  of Philip were not to be trusted; he was never more dangerous\r\n  than when he made overtures of peace and friendship. The most\r\n  powerful instruments that he employed for gaining ascendency\r\n  were the venal orators, who were to be found in every Grecian\r\n  city, and on whom it was necessary to inflict signal punishment,\r\n  before they had a chance of opposing foreign enemies. The advice\r\n  of Demosthenes now is, to dispatch reinforcements to the\r\n  Chersonese, to stir up the people of Greece, and even to solicit\r\n  the assistance of the Persian king, who had no less reason than\r\n  themselves to dread the ambition of Philip.\r\n\r\n  The events of the following year, when Philip attacked the\r\n  Propontine cities, fully justified the warning of Demosthenes.\r\n  And the extraordinary activity, which the Athenians displayed\r\n  in resisting him, shows that the exertions of the orator had\r\n  their due effect. Even Mitford confesses, with reference to the\r\n  operations of that period, that Athens found in Demosthenes an\r\n  able and effective minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany speeches, men of Athens, are made in almost every assembly about\r\nthe hostilities of Philip, hostilities which ever since the treaty of\r\npeace he has been committing as well against you as against the rest of\r\nthe Greeks; and all (I am sure) are ready to avow, though they forbear\r\nto do so, that our counsels and our measures should be directed to his\r\nhumiliation and chastisement: nevertheless, so low have our affairs been\r\nbrought by inattention and negligence, I fear it is a harsh truth to\r\nsay, that if all the orators had sought to suggest, and you to pass\r\nresolutions for the utter ruining of the commonwealth, we could not\r\nmethinks be worse off than we are. A variety of circumstances may have\r\nbrought us to this state; our affairs have not declined from one or two\r\ncauses only; but, if you rightly examine, you will find it chiefly owing\r\nto the orators, who study to please you rather than advise for the best.\r\nSome of whom, Athenians, seeking to maintain the basis of their own\r\npower and repute, have no forethought for the future, and therefore\r\nthink you also ought to have none; others, accusing and calumniating\r\npractical statesmen, labor only to make Athens punish Athens, and in\r\nsuch occupations to engage her, that Philip may have liberty to say and\r\ndo what he pleases. Politics of this kind are common here, but are the\r\ncauses of your failures and embarrassment. I beg, Athenians, that you\r\nwill not resent my plain speaking of the truth. Only consider. You hold\r\nliberty of speech in other matters to be the general right of all\r\nresidents in Athens, insomuch that you allow a measure of it even to\r\nforeigners and slaves, and many servants may be seen among you speaking\r\ntheir thoughts more freely than citizens in some other states; and yet\r\nyou have altogether banished it from your councils. The result has been,\r\nthat in the assembly you give yourselves airs and are flattered at\r\nhearing nothing but compliments, in your measures and proceedings you\r\nare brought to the utmost peril. If such be your disposition now, I must\r\nbe silent: if you will listen to good advice without flattery, I am\r\nready to speak. For though our affairs are in a deplorable condition,\r\nthough many sacrifices have been made, still, if you will choose to\r\nperform your duty, it is possible to repair it all. A paradox, and yet a\r\ntruth, am I about to state. That which is the most lamentable in the\r\npast is best for the future. How is this? Because you performed no part\r\nof your duty, great or small, and therefore you fared ill: had you done\r\nall that became you, and your situation were the same, there would be no\r\nhope of amendment. Philip has indeed prevailed over your sloth and\r\nnegligence, but not over the country: you have not been worsted; you\r\nhave not even bestirred yourselves.\r\n\r\nIf now we were all agreed that Philip is at war with Athens and\r\ninfringing the peace, nothing would a speaker need to urge or advise but\r\nthe safest and easiest way of resisting him. But since, at the very time\r\nwhen Philip is capturing cities and retaining divers of our dominions\r\nand assailing all people, there are men so unreasonable as to listen to\r\nrepeated declarations in the assembly, that some of us are kindling war,\r\none must be cautious and set this matter right: for whoever moves or\r\nadvises a measure of defense, is in danger of being accused afterward as\r\nauthor of the war.\r\n\r\nI will first then examine and determine this point, whether it be in our\r\npower to deliberate on peace or war. If the country may be at peace, if\r\nit depends on us, (to begin with this,) I say we ought to maintain\r\npeace, and I call upon the affirmant to move a resolution, to take some\r\nmeasure, and not to palter with us. But if another, having arms in his\r\nhand and a large force around him, amuses you with the name of peace,\r\nwhile he carries on the operations of war, what is left but to defend\r\nyourselves? You may profess to be at peace, if you like, as he does; I\r\nquarrel not with that. But if any man supposes this to be a peace, which\r\nwill enable Philip to master all else and attack you last, he is a\r\nmadman, or he talks of a peace observed toward him by you, not toward\r\nyou by him. This it is that Philip purchases by all his expenditure, the\r\nprivilege of assailing you without being assailed in turn.\r\n\r\nIf we really wait until he avows that he is at war with us, we are the\r\nsimplest of mortals, for he would not declare that, though he marched\r\neven against Attica and Piraeus, at least if we may judge from his\r\nconduct to others. For example, to the Olynthians he declared, when he\r\nwas forty furlongs from their city, that there was no alternative, but\r\neither they must quit Olynthus or he Macedonia; though before that time,\r\nwhenever he was accused of such an intent, he took it ill and sent\r\nembassadors to justify himself. Again, he marched towards the Phocions\r\nas if they were allies, and there were Phocian envoys who accompanied\r\nhis march, and many among you contended that his advance would not\r\nbenefit the Thebans. And he came into Thessaly of late as a friend and\r\nally, yet he has taken possession of Pherae: and lastly he told these\r\nwretched people of Oreus, [Footnote: When he established his creature\r\nPhilistides in the government of Oreus, as mentioned in the last oration\r\nand at the end of this.] that he had sent his soldiers out of good-will\r\nto visit them, as he heard they were in trouble and dissension, and it\r\nwas the part of allies and true friends to lend assistance on such\r\noccasions. People who would never have harmed him, though they might\r\nhave adopted measures of defense, he chose to deceive rather than warn\r\nthem of his attack; and think ye he would declare war against you before\r\nhe began it, and that while you are willing to be deceived? Impossible.\r\nHe would be the silliest of mankind, if, while you the injured parties\r\nmake no complaint against him, but are accusing your own countrymen, he\r\nshould terminate your intestine strife and jealousies, warn you to turn\r\nagainst him, and remove the pretexts of his hirelings for asserting, to\r\namuse you, that he makes no war upon Athens. O heavens! would any\r\nrational being judge by words rather than by actions, who is at peace\r\nwith him and who at war? Surely none. Well then; Philip immediately\r\nafter the peace, before Diopithes was in command or the settlers in the\r\nChersonese had been sent out, took Serrium and Doriscus, and expelled\r\nfrom Serrium and the Sacred Mount the troops whom your general had\r\nstationed there. [Footnote: This general was Chares, to whom\r\nCersobleptes had intrusted the defense of those places. The Sacred Mount\r\nwas a fortified position on the northern coast of the Hellespont. It was\r\nhere that Miltocythes intrenched himself, when he rebelled against\r\nCotys; and Philip took possession of it just before the peace with\r\nAthens was concluded, as being important to his operations against\r\nCersobleptes. The statement of Demosthenes, that the oaths had then been\r\ntaken, is, as Jacobs observes, incorrect; for they were sworn afterward\r\nin Thessaly. But the argument is substantially the same, for the peace\r\nhad been agreed to, and the ratification was purposely delayed by\r\nPhilip, to gain time for the completion of his designs.] What do you\r\ncall such conduct? He had sworn the peace. Don't say--what does it\r\nsignify? how is the state concerned?--Whether it be a trifling matter,\r\nor of no concernment to you, is a different question: religion and\r\njustice have the same obligation, be the subject of the offense great or\r\nsmall. Tell me now; when he sends mercenaries into Chersonesus, which\r\nthe king and all the Greeks have acknowledged to be yours, when he avows\r\nhimself an auxiliary and writes us word so, what are such proceedings?\r\nHe says he is not at war; I can not however admit such conduct to be an\r\nobservance of the peace; far otherwise: I say, by his attempt on Megara,\r\n[Footnote: Not long before this oration was delivered, Philip was\r\nsuspected of a design to seize Megara. Demosthenes gives an account, in\r\nhis speech on the Embassy, of a conspiracy between two Megarians,\r\nPtaeodorus and Perilaus, to introduce Macedonian troops into the city.\r\nPhocion was sent by the Athenians to Megara, with the consent of the\r\nMegarian people, to protect them against foreign attack. He fortified\r\nthe city and port, connecting them by long walls, and put them in\r\nsecurity. The occupation of Megara by Philip must have been most\r\nperilous to Athens, especially while Euboea and Thebes were in his\r\ninterest; he would thus have inclosed her as it were in a net.] by his\r\nsetting up despotism in Euboea, by his present advance into Thrace, by\r\nhis intrigues in Peloponnesus, by the whole course of operations with\r\nhis army, he has been breaking the peace and making war upon you; unless\r\nindeed you will say, that those who establish batteries are not at war,\r\nuntil they apply them to the walls. But that you will not say: for\r\nwhoever contrives and prepares the means for my conquest, is at war with\r\nme, before he darts or draws the bow. What, if any thing should happen,\r\nis the risk you run? The alienation of the Hellespont, the subjection of\r\nMegara and Euboea to your enemy, the siding of the Peloponnesians with\r\nhim. Then can I allow, that one who sets such an engine at work against\r\nAthens is at peace with her? Quite the contrary. From the day that he\r\ndestroyed the Phocians I date his commencement of hostilities. Defend\r\nyourselves instantly, and I say you will be wise: delay it, and you may\r\nwish in vain to do so hereafter. So much do I dissent from your other\r\ncounselors, men of Athens, that I deem any discussion about Chersonesus\r\nor Byzantium out of place. Succor them--I advise that--watch that no\r\nharm befalls them, send all necessary supplies to your troops in that\r\nquarter; but let your deliberations be for the safety of all Greece, as\r\nbeing in the utmost peril. I must tell you why I am so alarmed at the\r\nstate of our affairs: that, if my reasonings are correct, you may share\r\nthem, and make some provision at least for yourselves, however\r\ndisinclined to do so for others: but if, in your judgment, I talk\r\nnonsense and absurdity, you may treat me as crazed, and not listen to\r\nme, either now or in future.\r\n\r\nThat Philip from a mean and humble origin has grown mighty, that the\r\nGreeks are jealous and quarreling among themselves, that it was far more\r\nwonderful for him to rise from that insignificance, than it would now\r\nbe, after so many acquisitions, to conquer what is left; these and\r\nsimilar matters, which I might dwell upon, I pass over. But I observe\r\nthat all people, beginning with you, have conceded to him a right, which\r\nin former times has been the subject of contest in every Grecian war.\r\nAnd what is this? The right of doing what he pleases, openly fleecing\r\nand pillaging the Greeks, one after another, attacking and enslaving\r\ntheir cities. You were at the head of the Greeks for seventy-three\r\nyears, [Footnote: This would be from about the end of the Persian war to\r\nthe end of the Peloponnesian, B. C. 405. Isocrates speaks of the Athenian\r\nsway as having lasted sixty-five or seventy years. But statements of\r\nthis kind are hardly intended to be made with perfect accuracy. In the\r\nthird Olynthiac, as we have seen, Demosthenes says, the Athenians had\r\nthe leadership by _consent of the Greeks_ for forty-five years.\r\nThis would exclude the Peloponnesian war.] the Lacedaemonians for\r\ntwenty-nine; [Footnote: From the end of the Peloponnesian war to the\r\nbattle of Naxos, B. C. 376.] and the Thebans had some power in these\r\nlatter times after the battle of Leuctra. Yet neither you, my\r\ncountrymen, nor Thebans nor Lacedaemonians, were ever licensed by the\r\nGreeks to act as you pleased; far otherwise. When you, or rather the\r\nAthenians at that time, appeared to be dealing harshly with certain\r\npeople, all the rest, even such as had no complaint against Athens,\r\nthought proper to side with the injured parties in a war against her.\r\nSo, when the Lacedaemonians became masters and succeeded to your empire,\r\non their attempting to encroach and make oppressive innovations,\r\n[Footnote: The Spartans, whose severe military discipline rendered them\r\nfar the best soldiers in Greece, were totally unfit to manage the\r\nempire, at the head of which they found themselves after the humiliation\r\nof Athens. Their attempt to force an oligarchy upon every dependent\r\nstate was an unwise policy, which made them generally odious. The\r\ndecemvirates of Lysander, and the governors ([Greek: _armostai_])\r\nestablished in various Greek cities to maintain Lacedaemonian influence,\r\nwere regarded as instruments of tyranny. It was found that Spartan\r\ngovernors and generals, when away from home, gave loose to their vicious\r\ninclinations, as if to indemnify themselves for the strictness of\r\ndomestic discipline. It became a maxim in their politics, that the end\r\njustified the means. The most flagrant proof was given by the seizure of\r\nthe Cadmea at Thebes; a measure, which led to a formidable confederacy\r\nagainst Sparta, and brought her to the verge of destruction.] a general\r\nwar was declared against them, even by such as had no cause of\r\ncomplaint. But wherefore mention other people? We ourselves and the\r\nLacedaemonians, although at the outset we could not allege any natural\r\ninjuries, thought proper to make war for the injustice that we saw done\r\nto our neighbors. Yet all the faults committed by the Spartans in those\r\nthirty years, and by our ancestors in the seventy, are less, men of\r\nAthens, than the wrongs which, in thirteen incomplete years that Philip\r\nhas been uppermost, [Footnote: _I. e._ in power; but, as Smead, an\r\nAmerican editor, truly observes, [Greek: _epipolyxei_] has a\r\ncontemptuous signification, Jacobs: _oben schwimmt_. The thirteen\r\nyears are reckoned from the time when Philip's interference in Thessaly\r\nbegan; before which he had not assumed an important character in\r\nsouthern Greece.] he has inflicted on the Greeks: nay they are scarcely\r\na fraction of these, as may easily be shown in a few words. Olynthus and\r\nMethone and Apollonia, and thirty-two cities [Footnote: The Chalcidian\r\ncities.] on the borders of Thrace, I pass over; all which he has so\r\ncruelly destroyed, that a visitor could hardly tell if they were ever\r\ninhabited: and of the Phocians, so considerable a people exterminated, I\r\nsay nothing. But what is the condition of Thessaly? Has he not taken\r\naway her constitutions and her cities, and established tetrarchies, to\r\nparcel her out, [Footnote: This statement does not disagree with the\r\nmention of the [Greek: _dekadarchia_] in the second Philippic.\r\nSupposing that Thessaly was not only divided into tetrarchics, four\r\nprovinces or cantons, but also governed by decemvirates of Philip's\r\nappointment, placed in divers of her cities, then by the former\r\ncontrivance she might be said [Greek: _donlenein kat ethnae_], by\r\nthe latter [Greek: _kata poleis_]. It is not clear indeed whether\r\nseveral decemvirates, or one for the whole country, is to be understood.\r\nThe singular number is equally capable of either interpretation.] not\r\nonly by cities, but also by provinces, for subjection? Are not the\r\nEuboean states governed now by despots, and that in an island near to\r\nThebes and Athens? Does he not expressly write in his epistles, \"I am at\r\npeace with those who are willing to obey me?\" Nor does he write so and\r\nnot act accordingly. He is gone to the Hellespont; he marched formerly\r\nagainst Ambracia; Elis, such an important city in Peloponnesus, he\r\npossesses; [Footnote: That is to say; a Macedonian faction prevailed in\r\nElis. The democratical party had some time before endeavored to regain\r\nthe ascendency, by aid of the Phocian mercenaries of Phalaecus; but they\r\nhad been defeated by the troops of Arcadia and Elis.] he plotted lately\r\nto get Megara: neither Hellenic nor Barbaric land contains the man's\r\nambition. [Footnote: So Juvenal, Sat X. 160:\r\n\r\n  Aestuat infelix angusto limite mundi,\r\n  Ut Gyarae clausus scopulis parvaque Seripho.\r\n\r\nAnd Virgil, Aen. IX. 644:\r\n\r\n  Nee te Troja capit.]\r\n\r\nAnd we the Greek community, seeing and hearing this, instead of sending\r\nembassies to one another about it and expressing indignation, are in\r\nsuch a miserable state, so intrenched in our miserable towns, that to\r\nthis day we can attempt nothing that interest or necessity requires; we\r\ncan not combine, or form any association for succor and alliance; we\r\nlook unconcernedly on the man's growing power, each resolving (methinks)\r\nto enjoy the interval that another is destroyed in, not caring or\r\nstriving for the salvation of Greece: for none can be ignorant, that\r\nPhilip, like some course or attack of fever or other disease, is coming\r\neven on those that yet seem very far removed. And you must be sensible,\r\nthat whatever wrong the Greeks sustained from Lacedaemonians or from us,\r\nwas at least inflicted by genuine people of Greece; and it might be felt\r\nin the same manner as if a lawful son, born to a large fortune,\r\ncommitted some fault or error in the management of it; on that ground\r\none would consider him open to censure and reproach, yet it could not be\r\nsaid that he was an alien, and not heir to the property which he so\r\ndealt with. But if a slave or a spurious child wasted and spoiled what\r\nhe had no interest in--Heavens! how much more heinous and hateful would\r\nall have pronounced it! And yet in regard to Philip and his conduct they\r\nfeel not this, although he is not only no Greek and noway akin to\r\nGreeks, but not even a barbarian of a place honorable to mention; in\r\nfact, a vile fellow of Macedon, from which a respectable slave could not\r\nbe purchased formerly.\r\n\r\nWhat is wanting to make his insolence complete? Besides his destruction\r\nof Grecian cities, does he not hold the Pythian games, the common\r\nfestival of Greece, and, if he comes not himself, send his vassals to\r\npreside? Is he not master of Thermopylae and the passes into Greece, and\r\nholds he not those places by garrisons and mercenaries? Has he not\r\nthrust aside Thessalians, ourselves, Dorians, the whole Amphictyonic\r\nbody, and got preaudience of the oracle, [Footnote: This privilege,\r\nwhich had belonged to the Phocians, was transferred to Philip. It was\r\nconsidered an advantage as well as an honor in ancient times; for there\r\nwere only certain days appointed in every month, when the oracle could\r\nbe consulted, and the order of consultation was determined by lot in\r\ncommon cases. The Delphians used to confer the right of pre-consultation\r\non particular states or persons as a reward for some service or act of\r\npiety. Thus the Spartans received it; and Croesus, king of Lydia, for\r\nthe magnificent presents which he sent to the temple.] to which even the\r\nGreeks do not all pretend? Does he not write to the Thessalians, what\r\nform of government to adopt? send mercenaries to Porthmus, [Footnote:\r\nPorthmus was the port of Eretria, on the strait, opposite Athens. The\r\ncircumstances are stated by Demosthenes at the latter end of the speech.\r\nBy expelling the [Greek: _daemos_] of Eretria, he means of course\r\nthe popular party, _die Volkspartei_, as Pabst has it; but they\r\nwould by their own partisans be called the people.] to expel the\r\nEretrian commonalty; others to Oreus, to set up Philistides as ruler?\r\nYet the Greeks endure to see all this; methinks they view it as they\r\nwould a hailstorm, each praying that it may not fall on himself, none\r\ntrying to prevent it. And not only are the outrages which he docs to\r\nGreece submitted to, but even the private wrongs of every people:\r\nnothing can go beyond this! Has he not wronged the Corinthians by\r\nattacking Ambracia [Footnote: Divers colonies were planted on the\r\nnorthwestern coast of Greece by the Corinthians, and also by the\r\nCoreyraeans, who were themselves colonists from Corinth. Among them were\r\nLeucas, Ambracia, Anactorium, Epidamnus, and Apollonia. Leucas afterward\r\nbecame insular, by cutting through the isthmus. Philip's meditated\r\nattack was in 343 B. C. after the conquest of Cassopia. Leucas, by its\r\ninsular position, would have been convenient for a descent on\r\nPeloponnesus. We have seen that this design of Philip was baffled by the\r\nexertions of Demosthenes.] and Leucas? the Achaians, by swearing to give\r\nNaupactus [Footnote: Naupactus, now _Lepanto_, lay on the northern\r\ncoast of the Corinthian gulf. At the close of the Peloponnesian war it\r\ncame into the hands of the Achaians, from whom it was taken by\r\nEpaminondas, but after his death they regained it. The Aetolians got\r\npossession of the town some time after, perhaps by Macedonian\r\nassistance.] to the Aetolians? from the Thebans taken Echinus?\r\n[Footnote: The Echinus here mentioned was a city on the northern coast\r\nof the Maliac gulf in Thessaly.] Is he not marching against the\r\nByzantines his allies? From us--I omit the rest--but keeps he not\r\nCardia, the greatest city of the Chersonese? Still under these\r\nindignities we are all slack and disheartened, and look toward our\r\nneighbors, distrusting one another, instead of the common enemy. And how\r\nthink ye a man, who behaves so insolently to all, how will he act, when\r\nhe gets each separately under his control?\r\n\r\nBut what has caused the mischief? There must be some cause, some good\r\nreason, why the Greeks were so eager for liberty then, and now are eager\r\nfor servitude. There was something, men of Athens, something in the\r\nhearts of the multitude then, which there is not now, which overcame the\r\nwealth of Persia and maintained the freedom of Greece, and quailed not\r\nunder any battle by land or sea; the loss whereof has ruined all, and\r\nthrown the affairs of Greece into confusion. What was this? Nothing\r\nsubtle or clever: simply that whoever took money from the aspirants for\r\npower or the corruptors of Greece were universally detested: it was\r\ndreadful to be convicted of bribery; the severest punishment was\r\ninflicted on the guilty, and there was no intercession or pardon. The\r\nfavorable moments for enterprise, which fortune frequently offers to the\r\ncareless against the vigilant, to them that will do nothing against\r\nthose that discharge all their duty, could not be bought from orators or\r\ngenerals; no more could mutual concord, nor distrust of tyrants and\r\nbarbarians, nor any thing of the kind. But now all such principles have\r\nbeen sold as in open market, and those imported in exchange, by which\r\nGreece is ruined and diseased. [Footnote: [Greek: _Apolole_] in\r\nreference to foreign affairs; [Greek: _nenosaeken_] in regard to\r\ninternal broils and commotions. Compare Shakspeare, Macbeth IV. 8.\r\n\r\n  O nation miserable,\r\n  When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again?]\r\n\r\nWhat are they? Envy where a man gets a bribe; laughter if he confesses\r\nit; mercy to the convicted; hatred of those that denounce the crime: all\r\nthe usual attendants upon corruption. [Footnote: He glances more\r\nparticularly at Philocrates, Demades, and Aeschines.] For as to ships\r\nand men and revenues and abundance of other materials, all that may be\r\nreckoned as constituting national strength--assuredly the Greeks of our\r\nday are more fully and perfectly supplied with such advantages than\r\nGreeks of the olden time. But they are all rendered useless,\r\nunavailable, unprofitable, by the agency of these traffickers.\r\n\r\nThat such is the present state of things, you must see, without\r\nrequiring my testimony: that it was different in former times, I will\r\ndemonstrate, not by speaking my own words, but by showing an inscription\r\nof your ancestors, which they graved on a brazen column and deposited in\r\nthe citadel, not for their own benefit, (they were right-minded enough\r\nwithout such records,) but for a memorial and example to instruct you,\r\nhow seriously such conduct should be taken up. What says the inscription\r\nthen? It says: \"Let Arthmius, son of Pythonax the Zelite, [Footnote:\r\nZelea is a town in Mysia. Arthmius was sent by Artaxerxes into\r\nPeloponnesus, to stir up a war against the Athenians, who had irritated\r\nhim by the assistance which they lent to Egypt. Aeschines says that\r\nArthmius was the [Greek: _proxenos_] of Athens, which may partly\r\naccount for the decree passed against him.] be declared an outlaw,\r\n[Footnote: Of the various degrees of [Greek: _atimia_] at Athens I\r\nshall speak hereafter. I translate the word here, so as to meet the case\r\nof a foreigner, who had nothing to do with the franchises of the\r\nAthenians, but who by their decree was excommunicated from the benefit\r\nof all international law.] and an enemy of the Athenian people and their\r\nallies, him and his family.\" Then the cause is written why this was\r\ndone: because he brought the Median gold into Peloponnesus. That is the\r\ninscription. By the gods! only consider and reflect among yourselves,\r\nwhat must have been the spirit, what the dignity of those Athenians who\r\nacted so! One Arthmius a Zelite, subject of the king, (for Zelea is in\r\nAsia,) because in his master's service he brought gold into\r\nPeloponnesus, not to Athens, they proclaimed an enemy of the Athenians\r\nand their allies, him and his family, and outlawed. That is, not the\r\noutlawry commonly spoken of: for what would a Zelite care, to be\r\nexcluded from Athenian franchises? It means not that; but in the\r\nstatutes of homicide it is written, in cases where a prosecution for\r\nmurder is not allowed, but killing is sanctioned, \"and let him die an\r\noutlaw,\" says the legislator: by which he means, that whoever kills such\r\na person shall be unpolluted. [Footnote: That is, his act being\r\njustifiable homicide, he shall not be deemed (in a religious point of\r\nview) impure. As to the Athenian law of homicide, see my article\r\n_Phonos_ in the Archaeological Dictionary.] Therefore they\r\nconsidered that the preservation of all Greece was their own concern:\r\n(but for such opinion, they would not have cared, whether people in\r\nPeloponnesus were bought and corrupted:) and whomsoever they discovered\r\ntaking bribes, they chastised and punished so severely as to record\r\ntheir names in brass. The natural result was, that Greece, was\r\nformidable to the Barbarian, not the Barbarian to Greece. 'Tis not so\r\nnow: since neither in this nor in other respects are your sentiments the\r\nsame. But what are they? You know yourselves: why am I to upbraid you\r\nwith every thing? The Greeks in general are alike and no better than\r\nyou. Therefore I say, our present affairs demand earnest attention and\r\nwholesome counsel. Shall I say what? Do you bid me, and won't you be\r\nangry?\r\n\r\n[_Here is read the public document which Demosthenes produces, after\r\nwhich he resumes his address_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The Secretary of the Assembly stood by the side of the\r\norator, and read any public documents, such as statutes, decrees, bills\r\nand the like, which the orator desired to refer to or to verify. It does\r\nnot appear what the document was, which Demosthenes caused to be read\r\nhere. If we may judge from the argument, it was some energetic\r\nresolution of the people, such as he would propose for an example on the\r\npresent occasion.]\r\n\r\nThere is a foolish saying of persons who wish to make us easy, that\r\nPhilip is not yet as powerful as the Lacedaemonians were formerly, who\r\nruled every where by land and sea, and had the king for their ally, and\r\nnothing withstood them; yet Athens resisted even that nation, and was\r\nnot destroyed. I myself believe, that, while every thing has received\r\ngreat improvement, and the present bears no resemblance to the past,\r\nnothing has been so changed and improved as the practice of war. For\r\nanciently, as I am informed, the Lacedaemonians and all Grecian people\r\nwould for four or five months, during the season [Footnote: The\r\ncampaigning season, during the summer and fine time of the year. The\r\nPeloponnesians generally invaded Attica when the corn was ripe, burning\r\nand plundering all in their route. Thucydides in his history divides the\r\nyear into two parts, summer and winter.] only, invade and ravage the\r\nland of their enemies with heavy-armed and national troops, and return\r\nhome again: and their ideas were so old-fashioned, or rather national,\r\nthey never purchased [Footnote: Compare the old lines of Ennius:\r\n\r\n  Non cauponantes bellum sed belligerantes\r\n  Ferro, non auro, vitam cernamus utrique.]\r\n\r\nan advantage from any; theirs was a legitimate and open warfare. But now\r\nyou doubtless perceive, that the majority of disasters have been\r\neffected by treason; nothing is done in fair field or combat. You hear\r\nof Philip marching where he pleases, not because he commands troops of\r\nthe line, but because he has attached to him a host of skirmishers,\r\ncavalry, archers, mercenaries, and the like. When with these he falls\r\nupon a people in civil dissension, and none (for mistrust) will march\r\nout to defend the country, he applies engines and besieges them. I need\r\nnot mention, that he makes no difference between winter and summer, that\r\nhe has no stated season of repose. You, knowing these things, reflecting\r\non them, must not let the war approach your territories, nor get your\r\nnecks broken, relying on the simplicity of the old war with the\r\nLacedaemonians, but take the longest time beforehand for defensive\r\nmeasures and preparations, see that he stirs not from home, avoid any\r\ndecisive engagement. For a war, if we choose, men of Athens, to pursue a\r\nright course, we have many natural advantages; such as the position of\r\nhis kingdom, which we may extensively plunder and ravage, and a thousand\r\nmore; but for a battle he is better trained than we are. [Footnote:\r\nChaeronea proved the wisdom of this advice. Similar counsel was given by\r\nPericles in the Peloponnesian war. Had the Athenians attempted to meet\r\nthe invading army in the field, they must inevitably have been defeated\r\nin the early period of the war.]\r\n\r\nNor is it enough to adopt these resolutions and oppose him by warlike\r\nmeasures: you must on calculation and on principle abhor his advocates\r\nhere, remembering that it is impossible to overcome your enemies abroad,\r\nuntil you have chastised those who are his ministers within the city.\r\nWhich, by Jupiter and all the gods, you can not and will not do! You\r\nhave arrived at such a pitch of folly or madness or--I know not what to\r\ncall it: I am tempted often to think, that some evil genius is driving\r\nyou to ruin--for the sake of scandal or envy or jest or any other cause,\r\nyou command hirelings to speak, (some of whom would not deny themselves\r\nto be hirelings,) and laugh when they abuse people. And this, bad as it\r\nis, is not the worst: you have allowed these persons more liberty for\r\ntheir political conduct than your faithful counselors: and see what\r\nevils are caused by listening to such men with indulgence. I will\r\nmention facts that you will all remember.\r\n\r\nIn Olynthus some of the statesmen were in Philip's interest, doing every\r\nthing for him; some were on the honest side, aiming to preserve their\r\nfellow-citizens from slavery. Which party now destroyed their country?\r\nor which betrayed the cavalry, [Footnote: After Olynthus was besieged by\r\nPhilip, various sallies were made from the city, some of which were\r\nsuccessful. But the treachery of Lasthenes and his accomplices ruined\r\nall. A body of five hundred horse were led by him into an ambuscade, and\r\ncaptured by the besiegers. See Appendix I.] by whose betrayal Olynthus\r\nfell? The creatures of Philip; they that, while the city stood,\r\nslandered and calumniated the honest counselors so effectually, that the\r\nOlynthian people were induced to banish Apollonides.\r\n\r\nNor is it there only, and nowhere else, that such practice has been\r\nruinous. In Eretria, when, after riddance of Plutarch [Footnote: When he\r\nwas expelled by Phocion after the battle of Tamynae, B. C. 354.] and his\r\nmercenaries, the people got possession of their city and of Porthmus,\r\nsome were for bringing the government over to you, others to Philip. His\r\npartisans were generally, rather exclusively, attended to by the\r\nwretched and unfortunate Eretrians, who at length were persuaded to\r\nexpel their faithful advisers. Philip, their ally and friend, sent\r\nHipponicus and a thousand mercenaries, demolished the walls of Porthmus,\r\nand established three rulers, Hipparchus, Automedon, Clitarchus. Since\r\nthat he has driven them out of the country, twice attempting their\r\ndeliverance: once he sent the troops with Eurylochus, afterward those of\r\nParmenio.\r\n\r\nWhat need of many words? In Oreus Philip's agents were Philistides,\r\nMenippus, Socrates, Thoas, and Agapaeus, who now hold the government:\r\nthat was quite notorious: one Euphraeus, a man that formerly dwelt here\r\namong you, was laboring for freedom and independence. How this man was\r\nin other respects insulted and trampled on by the people of Oreus, were\r\nlong to tell: but a year before the capture, discovering what\r\nPhilistides and his accomplices were about, he laid an information\r\nagainst them for treason. A multitude then combining, having Philip for\r\ntheir paymaster, and acting under his direction, take Euphraeus off to\r\nprison as a disturber of the public peace. Seeing which, the people of\r\nOreus, instead of assisting the one and beating the others to death,\r\nwith them were not angry, but said his punishment was just, and rejoiced\r\nat it. So the conspirators, having full liberty of action, laid their\r\nschemes and took their measures for the surrender of the city; if any of\r\nthe people observed it, they were silent and intimidated, remembering\r\nthe treatment of Euphraeus; and so wretched was their condition, that on\r\nthe approach of such a calamity none dared to utter a word, until the\r\nenemy drew up before the walls: then some were for defense, others for\r\nbetrayal. Since the city was thus basely and wickedly taken, the\r\ntraitors have held despotic rule; people who formerly rescued them, and\r\nwere ready for any maltreatment of Euphraeus, they have either banished\r\nor put to death; Euphraeus killed himself, proving by deed, that he had\r\nresisted Philip honestly and purely for the good of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the reason--perhaps you wonder--why the Olynthians and\r\nEretrians and Orites were more indulgent to Philip's advocates than to\r\ntheir own? The same which operates with you. They who advise for the\r\nbest can not always gratify their audience, though they would; for the\r\nsafety of the state must be attended to: their opponents by the very\r\ncounsel which is agreeable advance Philip's interest. One party required\r\ncontribution; the other said there was no necessity: one were for war\r\nand mistrust; the other for peace, until they were ensnared. And so on\r\nfor every thing else; (not to dwell on particulars;) the one made\r\nspeeches to please for the moment, and gave no annoyance; the other\r\noffered salutary counsel, that was offensive. Many rights did the people\r\nsurrender at last, not from any such motive of indulgence or ignorance,\r\nbut submitting in the belief that all was lost, Which, by Jupiter and\r\nApollo, I fear will be your case, when on calculation you see that\r\nnothing can be done. I pray, men of Athens, it may never come to this!\r\nBetter die a thousand deaths than render homage to Philip, or sacrifice\r\nany of your faithful counselors. A fine recompense have the people of\r\nOreus got, for trusting themselves to Philip's friends and spurning\r\nEuphraeus! Finely are the Eretrian commons rewarded, for having driven\r\naway your embassadors and yielded to Clitarchus! Yes; they are slaves,\r\nexposed to the lash and the torture. Finally he spared the Olynthians,\r\nwho appointed Lasthenes to command their horse, and expelled\r\nApollonides! It is folly and cowardice to cherish such hopes, and, while\r\nyou take evil counsel and shirk every duty, and even listen to those who\r\nplead for your enemies, to think you inhabit a city of such magnitude,\r\nthat you can not suffer any serious misfortune. Yea, and it is\r\ndisgraceful to exclaim on any occurrence, when it is too late, \"Who\r\nwould have expected it? However--this or that should have been done, the\r\nother left undone.\" Many things could the Olynthians mention now, which,\r\nif foreseen at the time would have prevented their destruction. Many\r\ncould the Orites mention, many the Phocians, and each of the ruined\r\nstates. But what would it avail them? As long as the vessel is safe,\r\nwhether it be great or small, the mariner, the pilot, every man in turn\r\nshould exert himself, and prevent its being overturned either by\r\naccident or design: but when the sea hath rolled over it, their efforts\r\nare vain. And we, likewise, O Athenians, while we are safe, with a\r\nmagnificent city, plentiful resources, lofty reputation--what [Footnote:\r\nSmead remarks here on the adroitness of the orator, who, instead of\r\napplying the simile of the ship to the administration of the state,\r\nwhich he felt that his quick-minded hearers had already done, suddenly\r\ninterrupts himself with a question, which would naturally occur to the\r\naudience.] must we do? Many of you, [Footnote: _You_, [Greek: _oi\r\nkathaemenoi_]. See my observations in the preface. I can not forbear\r\nnoticing the manner in which Francis translates the following [Greek:\r\n_nae Di ero_]. \"Let Jupiter be witness, with what integrity I shall\r\ndeclare my opinion.\" The original means nothing of the kind. It is rare\r\nthat [Greek: _nae Dia_] can be translated literally with effect.\r\nJacobs here has _wohlan_.] I dare say, have been longing to ask.\r\nWell then, I will tell you; I will move a resolution: pass it, if you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us prepare for our own defense; provide ourselves, I mean,\r\nwith ships, money, and troops--for surely, though all other people\r\nconsented to be slaves, we at least ought to struggle for freedom. When\r\nwe have completed our own preparations and made them apparent to the\r\nGreeks, then let us invite the rest, and send our embassadors every\r\nwhere with the intelligence, to Peloponnesus, to Rhodes, to Chios, to\r\nthe king, I say; (for it concerns his interests, not to let Philip make\r\nuniversal conquest;) that, if you prevail, you may have partners of your\r\ndangers and expenses, in case of necessity, or at all events that you\r\nmay delay the operations. For, since the war is against an individual,\r\n[Footnote: Because a state is a permanent power; a single man is liable\r\nto a variety of accidents, and his power terminates with his life.] not\r\nagainst the collected power of a state, even this may be useful; as were\r\nthe embassies last year to Peloponnesus, and the remonstrances with\r\nwhich I and Polyeuctus, that excellent man, and Hegesippus, and\r\nClitomachus, and Lycurgus, and the other envoys went round, and arrested\r\nPhilip's progress, so that he neither attacked Ambracia nor started for\r\nPeloponnesus. I say not, however, that you should invite the rest\r\nwithout adopting measures to protect yourselves: it would be folly,\r\nwhile you sacrifice your own interest, to profess a regard for that of\r\nstrangers, or to alarm others about the future, while for the present\r\nyou are unconcerned. I advise not this: I bid you send supplies to the\r\ntroops in Chersonesus, and do what else they require; prepare yourselves\r\nand make every effort first, then summon, gather, instruct the rest of\r\nthe Greeks. That is the duty of a state possessing a dignity such as\r\nyours. If you imagine that Chalcidians or Megarians will save Greece,\r\nwhile you run away from the contest, you imagine wrong. Well for any of\r\nthose people, if they are safe themselves. This work belongs to you:\r\nthis privilege your ancestors bequeathed to you, the prize of many\r\nperilous exertions. But if every one will sit seeking his pleasure, and\r\nstudying to be idle himself, never will he find others to do his work,\r\nand more than this, I fear we shall be under the necessity of doing all\r\nthat we like not at one time. Were proxies to be had, our inactivity\r\nwould have found them long ago; but they are not.\r\n\r\nSuch are the measures which I advise, which I propose: adopt them, and\r\neven yet, I believe, our prosperity may be re-established. If any man\r\nhas better advice to offer, let him communicate it openly. Whatever you\r\ndetermine, I pray to all the gods for a happy result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH PHILIPPIC.\r\n\r\n  THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  The subject of this Oration is the same as the last, viz.,\r\n  the necessity of resistance to Philip. The time of its\r\n  delivery would appear to have been a little later, while\r\n  Philip was yet in Thrace, and before he commenced the siege\r\n  of the Propontine towns. No new event is alluded to, except\r\n  the seizure of Hermias by the satrap Mentor, the exact date\r\n  of which is uncertain. The orator urges here, still more\r\n  strongly than he had done in the third Philippic, the\r\n  necessity of applying to Persia for assistance. His advice\r\n  was followed, and a negotiation was opened with that\r\n  monarchy, which led to the effective relief of Perinthus.\r\n  There is a remarkable passage in this speech, on the\r\n  importance of general unanimity, which seems to imply that\r\n  disputes had arisen between the richer and poorer classes,\r\n  chiefly in regard to the application of the public revenue.\r\n  The view which is here taken on the subject of the Theoric\r\n  distributions is so different from the argument in the\r\n  Olynthiacs, that modern critics have generally considered\r\n  this Oration to be spurious. Another ground for such opinion\r\n  is, that it contains various passages borrowed from other\r\n  speeches, and not very skillfully put together. Yet the\r\n  genuineness seems not to have been doubted by any of the\r\n  ancient grammarians.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelieving, men of Athens, that the subject of your consultation is\r\nserious and momentous to the state, I will endeavor to advise what I\r\nthink important. Many have been the faults, accumulated for some time\r\npast, which have brought us to this wretched condition; but none is\r\nunder the circumstances so distressing as this, men of Athens; that your\r\nminds are alienated from public business; you are attentive just while\r\nyou sit listening to some news, afterward you all go away, and, so far\r\nfrom caring for what you heard, you forget it altogether.\r\n\r\nWell; of the extent of Philip's arrogance and ambition, as evinced in\r\nhis dealings with every people, you have been informed. That it is not\r\npossible to restrain him in such course by speeches and harangues, no\r\nman can be ignorant: or, if other reasons fail to convince you, reflect\r\non this. Whenever we have had to discuss our claims, on no occasion have\r\nwe been worsted or judged in the wrong; we have still beaten and got the\r\nbetter of all in argument. But do his affairs go badly on this account,\r\nor ours well? By no means. For as Philip immediately proceeds, with arms\r\nin his hand, to put all he possesses boldly at stake, while we with our\r\nequities, the speakers as well as the hearers, are sitting still,\r\nactions (naturally enough) outstrip words, and people attend not to what\r\nwe have argued or may argue, but to what we do, All our doings are not\r\nlikely to protect any of our injured neighbors: I need not say more upon\r\nthe subject. Therefore, as the states are divided into two parties, one\r\nthat would neither hold arbitrary government nor submit to it, but live\r\nunder free and equal laws; another desiring to govern their\r\nfellow-citizens, and be subject to some third power, by whose assistance\r\nthey hope to accomplish that object; the partisans of Philip, [Footnote:\r\nI agree with Pabst and Auger that [Greek: _ekeinon_] signifies\r\nPhilip. Schaefer takes it neutrally.] who desire tyranny and despotism,\r\nhave every where prevailed, and I know not whether there is any state\r\nleft, besides our own, with a popular constitution firmly established.\r\nAnd those, that hold the government through him, have prevailed by all\r\nthe means efficacious in worldly affairs; principally and mainly, by\r\nhaving a person to bribe the corruptible; secondly, a point no less\r\nimportant, by having at their command, at whatever season they required,\r\nan army to put down their opponents. We, men of Athens, are not only in\r\nthese respects behindhand; we can not even be awaked; like men that have\r\ndrunk mandrake [Footnote: Used for a powerful opiate by the ancients. It\r\nis called Mandragora also in English. See Othello, Act III. Sc. 3.\r\n\r\n                  Not poppy, nor mandragora,\r\n  Nor all the drowsy sirups of the world,\r\n  Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\n  Which thou ow'dst yesterday.]\r\n\r\nor some other sleeping potion; and methinks--for I judge the truth must\r\nbe spoken--we are by reason thereof held in such disrepute and contempt,\r\nthat, among the states in imminent danger, some dispute with us for the\r\nlead, some for the place of congress; others have resolved to defend\r\nthemselves separately rather than in union with us.\r\n\r\nWhy am I so particular in mentioning these things? I seek not to give\r\noffense; so help me all the powers of heaven! I wish, men of Athens, to\r\nmake it clear and manifest to you all, that habitual sloth and\r\nindolence, the same in public matters as in private life, is not\r\nimmediately felt on every occasion of neglect, but shows itself in the\r\ngeneral result. [Footnote: Auger: \"presentent a la fin un total\r\neffrayant.\"] Look at Serrium and Doriscus; which were first disregarded\r\nafter the peace. Their names perhaps are unknown to many of you: yet\r\nyour careless abandonment of these lost Thrace and Cersobleptes your\r\nally. Again, seeing these places neglected and unsupported by you, he\r\ndemolished Porthmus, and raised a tyrant in Euboea like a fortress\r\nagainst Attica. This being disregarded, Megara was very nearly taken.\r\nYou were insensible, indifferent to all his aggressions; gave no\r\nintimation that you would not permit their continuance. He purchased\r\nAntrones, [Footnote: A town in Thessaly. We do not know all the details\r\nof Philip's proceedings in that country, but we have seen enough to\r\nknow, first under the guise of a protector he was not far short of being\r\nthe master of the Thessalian people. Some of these towns were actually\r\nin his possession, as Pherae and Pagasae. But that the Thesssalians were\r\nnever entirely subjugated to Macedonia, and still retained a hankering\r\nafter independence, was proved at a later period by their desertion of\r\nAntipater.] and not long after had got Oreus into his power. Many\r\ntransactions I omit; Pherae, the march against Ambracia, the massacres\r\nat Elis, [Footnote: The Elean exiles, having engaged in their service a\r\nbody of the Phocian mercenaries, made an incursion into Elis, but were\r\nrepelled. A large number of prisoners were taken and put to death. This\r\nhappened B. C. 343. The government of Elis was at that time in the hands\r\nof a Macedonian party.] and numberless others: for I have not entered\r\nupon these details, to enumerate the people whom Philip has oppressed\r\nand wronged, but to show you that Philip will not desist from wronging\r\nall people and pursuing his conquests, until an effort is made to\r\nprevent him.\r\n\r\nThere are persons whose custom it is, before they hear any speech in the\r\ndebate, to ask immediately--\"What must we do?\"--not with the intention\r\nof doing what they are told (or they would be the most serviceable of\r\nmen), but in order to get rid of the speaker. Nevertheless, you should\r\nbe advised what to do. First, O my countrymen, you must be firmly\r\nconvinced in your minds, that Philip is at war with our state, and has\r\nbroken the peace; that, while he is inimical and hostile to the whole of\r\nAthens, to the ground of Athens, and I may add, to the gods in Athens,\r\n(may they exterminate him!) there is nothing which he strives and plots\r\nagainst so much as our constitution, nothing in the world that he is so\r\nanxious about, as its destruction. And thereunto he is driven in some\r\nsort by necessity. Consider. He wishes for empire: he believes you to be\r\nhis only opponents. He has been a long time injuring you, as his own\r\nconscience best informs him; for by means of your possessions, which he\r\nis able to enjoy, he secures all the rest of his kingdom: had he given\r\nup Amphipolis and Potidaea, he would not have deemed himself safe even\r\nin Macedonia. He knows therefore, both that he is plotting against you,\r\nand that you are aware of it; and, supposing you to have common sense,\r\nhe judges that you detest him as you ought. Besides these important\r\nconsiderations, he is assured that, though he became master of every\r\nthing else, nothing can be safe for him while you are under popular\r\ngovernment: should any reverse ever befall him, (and many may happen to\r\na man,) all who are now under constraint will come for refuge to you.\r\nFor you are not inclined yourselves to encroach and usurp dominion; but\r\nfamous rather for checking the usurper or depriving him of his\r\nconquests, ever ready to molest the aspirants for empire, and vindicate\r\nthe liberty of all nations. He would not like that a free spirit should\r\nproceed from Athens, to watch the occasions of his weakness; nor is such\r\nreasoning foolish or idle. First then you must assume, that he is an\r\nirreconcilable enemy of our constitution and democracy; secondly, you\r\nmust be convinced, that all his operations and contrivances are designed\r\nfor the injury of our state. None of you can be so silly as to suppose,\r\nthat Philip covets those miseries in Thrace, (for what else can one call\r\nDrongilus and Cabyle and Mastira and the places which he is said now to\r\noccupy?) and that to get possession of them he endures hardships and\r\nwinters and the utmost peril, but covets not the harbors of Athens, the\r\ndocks, the galleys, the silver mines, the revenues of such value, the\r\nplace and the glory--never may he or any other man obtain these by the\r\nconquest of our city!--or that he will suffer you to keep these things,\r\nwhile for the sake of the barley and millet in Thracian caverns he\r\nwinters in the midst of horrors. [Footnote: See the note in the Oration\r\non the Chersonese, page 108, where the same words nearly are repeated.]\r\nImpossible. The object of that and every other enterprise of Philip is,\r\nto become master here.\r\n\r\nSo should every man be persuaded and convinced; and therefore, I say,\r\nshould not call upon your faithful and upright counselor to move a\r\nresolution for war: [Footnote: He deprecates here, as elsewhere, the\r\nfactious proceedings of certain opponents, who sought to fasten the\r\nresponsibility of a war on the orator, by forcing him to propose a\r\ndecree. This (argues Demosthenes) was unnecessary, as they were at war\r\nalready.] such were the part of men seeking an enemy to fight with, not\r\nmen forwarding the interests of the state. Only see. Suppose for the\r\nfirst breach of the treaty by Philip, or for the second or third, (for\r\nthere is a series of breaches,) any one had made a motion for war with\r\nhim, and Philip, just as he has now without such motion, had aided the\r\nCardians, would not the mover have been sacrificed? [Footnote: Pabst,\r\nfollowing Wolf, takes this in the more limited sense of being carried\r\noff to prison: _ins Gefangniss geworfen_. The English translators,\r\nwho have \"torn to pieces,\" understand the word in the same sense that I\r\ndo, as meaning generally \"destroyed, exterminated.\"] would not all have\r\nimputed Philip's aid of the Cardians to that cause? Don't then look for\r\na person to vent your anger on for Philip's trespasses, to throw to\r\nPhilip's hirelings to be torn in pieces. Do not, after yourselves voting\r\nfor war, dispute with each other, whether you ought or ought not to have\r\ndone so. As Philip conducts the war, so resist him: furnish those who\r\nare resisting him now [Footnote: Referring to Diopithes and his troops\r\nin the Chersonese.] with money and what else they demand; pay your\r\ncontributions, men of Athens, provide an army, swift-sailing galleys,\r\nhorses, transports, all the materials of war. Our present mode of\r\noperation is ridiculous; and by the gods I believe, that Philip could\r\nnot wish our republic to take any other course than what ye now pursue.\r\nYou miss your time, waste your money, look for a person to manage your\r\naffairs, are discontented, accuse one another. How all this comes about,\r\nI will explain, and how it may cease I will inform you.\r\n\r\nNothing, O men of Athens, have you ever set on foot or contrived rightly\r\nin the beginning: you always follow the event, stop when you are too\r\nlate, on any new occurrence prepare and bustle again. But that is not\r\nthe way of proceeding. It is never possible with sudden levies to\r\nperform any essential service. You must establish an army, provide\r\nmaintenance for it, and paymasters, and commissaries, so ordering it\r\nthat the strictest care be taken of your funds; demand from those\r\nofficers an account of the expenditure, from your general an account of\r\nthe campaign; and leave not the general any excuse for sailing elsewhere\r\nor prosecuting another enterprise. If ye so act and so resolve in\r\nearnest, you will compel Philip to observe a just peace and remain in\r\nhis own country, or will contend with him on equal terms; and perhaps,\r\nAthenians, perhaps, as you now inquire what Philip is doing, and whither\r\nmarching, so he may be anxious to learn, whither the troops of Athens\r\nare bound, and where they will make their appearance.\r\n\r\nShould any man think that these are affairs of great expense and toil\r\nand difficulty, he thinks rightly enough: but let him consider what the\r\nconsequences to Athens must be, if she refuse so to act, and he will\r\nfind it is our interest to perform our duties cheerfully. Suppose you\r\nhad some god for your surety--for certainly no mortal could guarantee a\r\nthing so fortunate--that, although you kept quiet and sacrificed every\r\nthing, Philip would not attack you at last, yet, by Jupiter and all the\r\ngods, it would be disgraceful, unworthy of yourselves, of the dignity of\r\nyour state, and the deeds of your ancestors, for the sake of selfish\r\nindolence to abandon the rest of Greece to servitude. For my part, I\r\nwould rather die than have advised such a course: however, if any other\r\nman advises it, and can prevail on you, be it so; make no defense,\r\nabandon all. But if no man holds such an opinion, if on the contrary we\r\nall foresee, that, the more we permit Philip to conquer, the more fierce\r\nand formidable an enemy we shall find him, what subterfuge remains? what\r\nexcuse for delay? Or when, O Athenians, shall we be willing to act as\r\nbecomes us? Peradventure, when there is some necessity. But what may be\r\ncalled the necessity of freemen is not only come, but past long ago; and\r\nthat of slaves you must surely deprecate. What is the difference? To a\r\nfreeman shame for what is occurring is the strongest necessity; I know\r\nof none stronger that can be mentioned: to a slave, stripes and bodily\r\nchastisement; abominable things! too shocking to name!\r\n\r\nTo be backward, men of Athens, in performing those services to which the\r\nperson and property of every one are liable, is wrong, very wrong, and\r\nyet it admits of some excuse: but refusing even to bear what is\r\nnecessary to be heard, and fit to be considered, this calls for the\r\nseverest censure. Your practice however is, neither to attend until the\r\nbusiness actually presses, as it does now, nor to deliberate about any\r\nthing at leisure. When Philip is preparing, you, instead of doing the\r\nlike and making counter-preparation, remain listless, and, if any one\r\nspeaks a word, clamor him down: when you receive news that any place is\r\nlost or besieged, then you listen and prepare. But the time to have\r\nheard and consulted was then when you declined; the time to act and\r\nemploy your preparations is now that you are hearing. Such being your\r\nhabits, you are the only people who adopt this singular course: others\r\ndeliberate usually before action, you deliberate after action. One thing\r\n[Footnote: He means negotiation with Persia, to obtain pecuniary\r\nassistance.] remains, which should have been done long ago, but even yet\r\nis not too late: I will mention it. Nothing in the world does Athens\r\nneed so much, as money for approaching exigencies. Lucky events have\r\noccurred, and, if we rightly improve them, perhaps good service may be\r\ndone. In the first place, those, [Footnote: The Thracians, who had\r\nalways been regarded as benefactors of the Persian king, since they\r\nassisted Darius on his invasion of Scythia. Philip was making war in\r\nThrace at this time, and had subjected a considerable part of the\r\ncountry.] whom the king trusts and regards as his benefactors, are at\r\nenmity and war with Philip. Secondly, the agent and confidant [Footnote:\r\nHermias, governor of Atarneus in Mysia, who for his treasonable\r\npractices against Artaxerxes was seized by Mentor and sent in chains to\r\nSusa, where he was put to death. He was a friend of Aristotle, who was\r\nat his court, when he was taken prisoner. The philosopher afterward\r\nmarried his sister.] of all Philip's preparations against the king has\r\nbeen snatched off, and the king will hear all the proceedings, not from\r\nAthenian accusers, whom he might consider to be speaking for their own\r\ninterests, but from the acting minister himself; the charges therefore\r\nwill be credible, and the only remaining argument for our embassadors\r\nwill be, one which the Persian monarch will rejoice to hear, that we\r\nshould take common vengeance on the injurer of both, and that Philip is\r\nmuch more formidable to the king, if he attack us first; for, should we\r\nbe left in the lurch and suffer any mishap, he will march against the\r\nking without fear. On all these matters then I advise that you dispatch\r\nan embassy to confer with the king, and put aside that nonsense which\r\nhas so often damaged you--\"the barbarian,\" forsooth, \"the common\r\nenemy\"--and the like. I confess, when I see a man alarmed at a prince in\r\nSusa and Ecbatana, and declaring him to be an enemy of Athens, him that\r\nformerly [Footnote: In the confederate war, when the Persian fleet\r\nenabled Conon to defeat the Lacedaemonians at Onidus, B. C. 394.]\r\nassisted in re-establishing her power, and lately made overtures\r\n[Footnote: Artaxerxes had applied both to Athens and Lacedaemon to aid\r\nhim in the recovery of Egypt, which for many years had been held in a\r\nstate of revolt. Both these states refused to assist him. He then\r\napplied to Thebes and Argos, each of which sent an auxiliary force.]--if\r\nyou did not accept them, but voted refusal, the fault is not his--while\r\nthe same man speaks a different language of one who is close at our\r\ndoors, and growing up in the centre of Greece to be the plunderer of her\r\npeople; I marvel, I dread this man, whoever he is, because he dreads not\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing too, the attacking of which by unjust reproach\r\nand improper language hurts the state, and affords an excuse to men who\r\nare unwilling to perform any public duty: indeed you will find that\r\nevery failure to discharge the obligation of a citizen is attributable\r\nto this. I am really afraid to discuss the matter; however, I will speak\r\nout.\r\n\r\nI believe I can suggest, for the advantage of the state, a plea for the\r\npoor against the rich, and for men of property against the indigent;\r\ncould we remove the clamor which some persons unfairly raise about the\r\ntheatric fund, [Footnote: Boeckh, Schaefer, and others, regard it as\r\nconclusive against the genuineness of this Oration, that a different\r\nview is here taken on the subject of the Theoric fund from that which\r\nDemosthenes had expressed in the Olynthiacs. And certainly it is a\r\nstrong argument. It is possible, however, that circumstances may have\r\ninduced him to modify his opinion, or he may have thought it dangerous\r\nto meddle with the law of Eubulus at the present crisis, which called\r\nfor the greatest unanimity among all classes. We may partly gather from\r\nthis speech, that there had been some agitation among the lower classes,\r\noccasioned by the complaints of the wealthy against this law. Any\r\nagitation tending to a spirit of communism must have been extremely\r\ndangerous at Athens, where the people had such power of muleting the\r\nhigher classes by their votes in the popular assembly and courts of\r\njustice. It might therefore be better to let the people alone with their\r\ntheatrical treats, their fees and largesses, than to provoke retaliation\r\nby abridging such enjoyments. Leland observes on the subject as\r\nfollows--\"All that the orator here says in defense of the theatrical\r\nappointments is expressed with a caution and reserve quite opposite to\r\nhis usual openness and freedom; and which plainly betray a consciousness\r\nof his being inconsistent with his former sentiments. How far he may be\r\nexcused by the supposed necessity of yielding to the violent\r\nprepossessions of the people, and giving up a favorite point, I can not\r\npretend to determine. But it is certainly not very honorable to\r\nDemosthenes, to suppose with Ulpian, that his former opposition was\r\nmerely personal, and that the death of Eubulus now put an end to it.\"]\r\nand the fear that it can not stand without some signal mischief. No\r\ngreater help to our affairs could we introduce; [Footnote: Viz., than\r\nthe removal of this clamor and alarm about the theatric fund.] none that\r\nwould more strengthen the whole community. Look at it thus. I will\r\ncommence on behalf of those who are considered the needy class. There\r\nwas a time with us, not long ago, when only a hundred and thirty talents\r\ncame into the state; [Footnote: This must be understood (according to\r\nBoeckh) of the tribute only, which came in from the allies. The total\r\nrevenue of Athens must have greatly exceeded this.] and among the\r\npersons qualified to command ships or pay property-tax, there was not\r\none who claimed exemption from his duty because no surplus existed:\r\n[Footnote: There was as much ground for legal exemption then as there is\r\nnow; and yet it was never claimed. Why should the rich seek to be\r\nrelieved from their burdens because of an abundance of revenue? That\r\nabundance is for the general benefit of the state, not for theirs in\r\nparticular. Such appears to be the argument, perhaps not quite\r\nsatisfactory; but such it is. Pabst, apparently reading [Greek: _aph\r\nheautou_], has: _der nicht aus eigenem Antrieb seine Schuldigkeit\r\nzu thun bereit war, weil kein Gelduberschuss vorhanden war_.] galleys\r\nsailed, money was forthcoming, every thing needful was done. Since that\r\ntime fortune happily has increased the revenue, and four hundred talents\r\ncome in instead of one, without loss to any men of property, but with\r\ngain to them; for all the wealthy come for their share of the fund, and\r\nthey are welcome to it. [Footnote: _I. e._ the Theoric fund, in\r\nwhich every member of the commonwealth had a right to share.] Why then\r\ndo we reproach one another on this account, and make it an excuse for\r\ndeclining our duties, unless we grudge the relief given by fortune to\r\nthe poor? I would be sorry to blame them myself, and I think it not\r\nright. In private families I never see a young man behaving so to his\r\nelders, so unfeeling or so unreasonable, as to refuse to do any thing\r\nhimself, unless all the rest will do what he does. Such a person would\r\ncertainly be amenable to the laws against undutiful conduct: [Footnote:\r\nPabst: _die Gesetze wegen ungebuhrlicher Behandlung der Eltern_.\r\n[Greek: _Kakosis_], \"maltreatment\", was a technical term in the\r\nAttic law, denoting a failure of duty on the part of husbands, children,\r\nor guardians, toward their wives, parents, or wards, for which they were\r\nliable to be tried and punished in a suit called [Greek: _kakoseos\r\ndikae_]. The jurisdiction over this offense belonged to the Archon,\r\nwho was the protector of all family rights.] for I ween there is a\r\ntribute assigned to parents both by nature and by law, which ought to be\r\ncheerfully offered and amply paid. Accordingly, as each individual among\r\nus hath a parent, so should we regard the whole people as parents of the\r\nstate, and, so far from depriving them of what the state bestows, we\r\nought, in the absence of such bounty, to find other means to keep them\r\nfrom destitution. If the rich will adopt this principle, I think they\r\nwill act both justly and wisely; for to deprive any class of a necessary\r\nprovision, is to unite them in disaffection to the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nTo the poor I would recommend, that they remove the cause, which makes\r\nmen of property discontented with the present system, and excites their\r\njust complaints. I shall take the same course on behalf of the wealthy\r\nas I did just now, and not hesitate to speak the truth. There can not, I\r\nbelieve, be found a wretch so hard-hearted--I will not say among\r\nAthenians, but among any other people--who would be sorry to see poor\r\nmen, men without the necessaries of life, receiving these bounties.\r\nWhere then is the pinch [Footnote: The expression \"Where is the rub?\"\r\nwould be still nearer to the original, and the expression reminds one of\r\nthe line in Hamlet:\r\n\r\n  To sleep! perchance to dream! ay, there's the rub.\r\n\r\nReiske says the simile is taken from the collision of chariots in the\r\nrace; but this is confining it too much. His vernacular explanation is:\r\n_woran stosst es sich? wo ist der Haken?_ Pabst has: _woran\r\nstosst sich die Sache, und was erzeugt den Verdruss?_] of the matter?\r\nwhere the difficulty? When they see certain persons transferring the\r\nusage established for the public revenue to private property, and the\r\norator becoming immediately powerful with you, yea, (so far as privilege\r\ncan make him,) immortal, and your secret vote contradicting your public\r\nclamor. [Footnote: Having admonished the higher classes to pay their\r\nproperty-tax and perform their public services cheerfully, and without\r\nseeking to be relieved at the expense of the public revenue, he proceeds\r\nto remind the lower classes of their duty. He warns them, that, while\r\nthey receive a benefit from the funds of the state, they must not\r\nendeavor to increase those funds unduly by an invasion of the rights of\r\nproperty. His language is not open, but would easily be understood by\r\nhis audience. The Athenians ought not to promote lawsuits to increase\r\ncourt-fees; not to encourage prosecutions against wealthy citizens, in\r\norder to obtain fines and confiscations. He insinuates that there was\r\ntoo much cause for complaint already. [Greek: _Ton legonta_] is,\r\nnot as Schaefer contends, the rich man pleading his cause before the\r\npeople, but, as Wolf explains it, the popular orator or informer, who\r\nspeedily rose to favor and influence, of which it was not easy to\r\ndeprive him. His opponent, speaking in a just cause, might be applauded\r\nat the time, but the votes showed what was the real bias of the people.\r\nIn courts of justice at Athens the voting was usually by a secret\r\nballot; (see my article _Psephus_ in the Archaeological\r\nDictionary;) and there being a large number of jurors, it would be\r\ndifficult to discover by whose votes the verdict was obtained. It is\r\nimpossible to read the frequent appeals made by Athenian speakers to the\r\npassions and prejudices of the jury, without seeing that there was some\r\nground for the insinuations of the orator in this passage.] Hence arises\r\nmistrust, hence indignation. We ought, O ye men of Athens, to have a\r\njust communion of political rights; the opulent holding themselves\r\nsecure in their fortunes, and without fear of losing them, yet in time\r\nof danger imparting their substance freely for the defense of their\r\ncountry; while the rest consider the public revenue as public, and\r\nreceive their share, but look on private property as belonging to the\r\nindividual owner. Thus it is that a small commonwealth becomes great,\r\nand a great one is preserved. To speak generally then, such are the\r\nobligations of each class; to insure their performance according to law,\r\nsome regulation should be made.\r\n\r\nThe causes of our present troubles and embarrassment are many and of\r\nancient date: if you are willing to hear, I will declare them. You have\r\nquitted, O Athenians, the position in which your ancestors left you; you\r\nhave been persuaded by these politicians, that to stand foremost of the\r\nGreeks, to keep a permanent force and redress injured nations, is all\r\nvanity and idle expense; you imagine that to live in quiet, to perform\r\nno duty, to abandon one thing after another and let strangers seize on\r\nall, brings with it marvelous welfare and abundant security. By such\r\nmeans a stranger has advanced to the post which you ought to have\r\noccupied, has become prosperous and great, and made large conquest;\r\nnaturally enough. A prize there was, noble, great, and glorious, one for\r\nwhich the mightiest states were contending all along; but as the\r\nLacedaemonians were humbled, the Thebans had their hands full through\r\nthe Phocian war, and we took no regard, he carried it off without\r\ncompetition. The result has been, to others terror, to him a vast\r\nalliance and extended power; while difficulties so many and so\r\ndistressing surround the Greeks, that even advice is not easy to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nYet, perilous as I conceive the present crisis to be for all, no people\r\nare in such danger as you, men of Athens; not only because Philip's\r\ndesigns are especially aimed at you, but because of all people you are\r\nthe most remiss. If, seeing the abundance of commodities and cheapness\r\nin your market, you are beguiled into a belief that the state is in no\r\ndanger, your judgment is neither becoming nor correct. A market or a\r\nfair one may, from such appearances, judge to be well or ill supplied:\r\nbut for a state, which every aspirant for the empire of Greece has\r\ndeemed to be alone capable of opposing him, and defending the liberty of\r\nall--for such a state! verily her marketable commodities are not the\r\ntest of prosperity, but this--whether she can depend on the good-will of\r\nher allies; whether she is puissant in arms. On behalf of such a state\r\nthese are the things to be considered; and in these respects your\r\ncondition is wretched and deplorable. You will understand it by a simple\r\nreflection. When have the affairs of Greece been in the greatest\r\nconfusion? No other time could any man point out but the present. In\r\nformer times Greece was divided into two parties, that of the\r\nLacedaemonians and ours: some of the Greeks were subject to us, some to\r\nthem. The Persian, on his own account, was mistrusted equally by all,\r\nbut he used to make friends of the vanquished parties, and retain their\r\nconfidence, until he put them on an equality with the other side; after\r\nwhich those that he succored would hate him as much as his original\r\nenemies. Now however the king is on friendly terms with all the Greeks,\r\nthough least friendly with us, unless we put matters right. Now too\r\nthere are protectors [Footnote: This is said with some irony: many\r\nstates offer to come forward as protectors, but only on condition of\r\ntaking the lead: they will not join the common cause on fair terms. Many\r\nof the translations miss the sense here. Leland understands it rightly:\r\n\"there are several cities which affect the character of guardians and\r\nprotectors.\" Auger confounds this sentence with the next: \"il s' eleve\r\nde tous cotes plusieurs puissances qui aspirent toutes a la primaute.\"]\r\nspringing up in every quarter, and all claim the precedency, though some\r\nindeed have abandoned the cause, or envy and distrust each other--more\r\nshame for them--and every state is isolated, Argives, Thebans,\r\nLacedaemonians, Corinthians, Arcadians, and ourselves. But, divided as\r\nGreece is among so many parties and so many leaderships, if I must speak\r\nthe truth freely, there is no state whose offices and halls of council\r\nappear more deserted by Grecian politics than ours. And no wonder; when\r\nneither friendship, nor confidence, nor fear leads any to negotiate with\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThis, ye men of Athens, has come not from any single cause, (or you\r\nmight easily mend it,) but from a great variety and long series of\r\nerrors. I will not stop to recount them, but will mention one, to which\r\nall may be referred, beseeching you not to be offended, if I boldly\r\nspeak the truth.\r\n\r\nYour interests are sold on every favorable opportunity: you partake of\r\nthe idleness and ease, under the charm whereof you resent not your\r\nwrongs; while other persons get the reward. [Footnote: Schaefer rightly\r\nexplains [Greek: _timas_] to mean the price received for treason.\r\nBut most of the translators, following Wolf, understand it to mean the\r\nhonors won by Philip. [Greek: _Tois adikousin_] is rendered by\r\nAuger, Leland, and Francis, \"the traitors.\" I think it rather refers to,\r\nor at least includes, the enemies who profited by the treason, and made\r\nconquests from Athens: of course meaning Philip in particular.] Into all\r\nthese cases I could not enter now: but when any question about Philip\r\narises, some one starts up directly and says--\"We must have no trifling,\r\nno proposal of war\"--and then goes on to say--\"What a blessing it is to\r\nbe at peace! what a grievance to maintain a large army!\"--and\r\nagain--\"Certain persons wish to plunder the treasury\"--and other\r\narguments they urge, no doubt, in the full conviction of their truth.\r\n[Footnote: There is no difficulty in this, if we understand it to be\r\nironical; and no need of any amendment.] But surely there is no need of\r\npersuading you to observe peace, you that sit here persuaded already. It\r\nis Philip (who is making war) that needs persuasion: prevail on him, and\r\nall is ready on your part. We should consider as grievous, not what we\r\nexpend for our deliverance, but what we shall suffer in case of refusal.\r\nPlunder of the treasury should be prevented by devising a plan for its\r\nsafe custody, not by abandoning our interests. Yet this very thing makes\r\nme indignant, that some of you are pained at the thought of your\r\ntreasury being robbed, though it depends on yourselves to guard it and\r\nto punish the criminal, but are not pained to see Philip plundering\r\nGreece, plundering as he does one people after another, to forward his\r\ndesigns upon you.\r\n\r\nHow comes it, ye men of Athens, that of this flagrant aggressor, this\r\ncapturer of cities, no one has ever declared that he commits hostility\r\nor injustice, while those who counsel against submission and sacrifice\r\nare charged as the authors of war? The reason is, that people wish to\r\ncast upon your faithful counselors the blame of any untoward events in\r\nthe war; for war must necessarily be attended with many misfortunes.\r\nThey believe that, if you resist Philip with one heart and mind, you\r\nwill prevail against him, and they can be hirelings no longer; but that\r\nif on the first outcry [Footnote: Leland: \"the first unhappy accident.\"\r\nFrancis gives the right meaning, but with too many words; \"the first\r\ntumults occasioned by any unfortunate success.\" Spillau: \"the first\r\nalarm.\"] you arraign certain persons and bring them to trial, they by\r\naccusing such persons will gain a double advantage, repute among the\r\nAthenians and recompense from Philip; and that you will punish your\r\nfriendly advisers for a cause for which you ought to punish the\r\ntraitors. Such are the hopes, such the contrivance of these charges,\r\n\"that certain persons wish to kindle a war.\" I am sure, however, that,\r\nwithout any Athenian moving a declaration of war, Philip has taken many\r\nof our possessions, and has recently sent succor to Cardia. If we choose\r\nto assume that he is not making war against us, he would be the simplest\r\nof mankind to convince us of our mistake: for when the sufferers\r\ndisclaim the injury, what should the offenders do? But when he marches\r\nto attack us, what shall we say then? He will assure us that he is not\r\nmaking war, as he assured the Orites, when his troops were in their\r\ncountry, as he assured the Pheraeans before he assaulted their walls,\r\nand the Olynthians in the first instance, until he was in their\r\nterritories with his army. Shall we then say, that persons who bid us\r\ndefend ourselves kindle a war? If so, we must be slaves; for nothing\r\nelse remains.\r\n\r\nBut remember: you have more at stake than some other people. Philip\r\ndesires not to subjugate your city, but to destroy it utterly. He is\r\nconvinced, you will not submit to be slaves; if you were inclined, you\r\nwould not know how, having been accustomed to command: you will be able,\r\nshould occasion offer, to give him more trouble than any people in the\r\nworld. For this reason he will show us no mercy, if he get us into his\r\npower: and therefore you must make up your minds, that the struggle will\r\nbe one for life and death. These persons, who have openly sold\r\nthemselves to Philip, you must execrate, you must beat their brains out:\r\nfor it is impossible, I say impossible, to vanquish your foreign\r\nenemies, until you have punished your enemies within the city: these are\r\nthe stumbling-blocks that must cripple your efforts against the\r\nforeigner.\r\n\r\nFrom what cause, do ye think, Philip insults you now; (for his conduct,\r\nin my judgment, amounts to nothing less;) and while he deceives other\r\npeople by doing them services--this at least is something--you he\r\nthreatens already? For example, the Thessalians by many benefits he\r\nseduced into their present servitude: no man can tell how he cheated the\r\npoor Olynthians, giving them first Potidaea and many other places: now\r\nhe is luring the Thebans, having delivered up Boeotia to them, and freed\r\nthem from a tedious and harassing war. Of these people, who each got a\r\ncertain advantage, some have suffered what is notorious to all, others\r\nhave yet to suffer what may befall them. As to yourselves; the amount of\r\nyour losses I do not mention: but in the very making of the peace how\r\nhave you been deceived! how plundered! Lost you not the Phocians,\r\nThermopylae, country toward Thrace, Doriscus, Serrium, Cersobleptes\r\nhimself? Holds he not Cardia now, and avows it? Why then does he behave\r\nthus to other people, and in a different way to you? Because our city is\r\nthe only one where liberty is allowed to speak for the enemy, where a\r\nman taking a bribe may safely address the people, though they have been\r\ndeprived of their possessions. It was not safe at Olynthus to advocate\r\nPhilip's cause, without the Olynthian people sharing the benefit by\r\npossession of Potidaea. It was not safe to advocate Philip's cause in\r\nThessaly, without the people of Thessaly sharing the benefit, by\r\nPhilip's expelling their tyrants and restoring the Pylaean Synod. It was\r\nnot safe at Thebes, until he restored Boeotia to them, and destroyed the\r\nPhocians. But at Athens, though Philip has taken from you Amphipolis and\r\nthe Cardian territory, and is even turning Euboea into a hostile post,\r\nand advancing to attack Byzantium, it is safe to speak on Philip's\r\nbehalf. Yea, among these men, some have risen rapidly from poverty to\r\nwealth, from meanness and obscurity to repute and honor, while you, on\r\nthe contrary, have fallen from honor to obscurity, from wealth to\r\nindigence. For the riches of a state I consider to be allies,\r\nconfidence, good-will; of all which you are destitute. And by your\r\nneglecting these things and suffering your interests thus to be swept\r\naway, Philip has grown prosperous and mighty, formidable to all the\r\nGreeks and barbarians, while you are forlorn and abject, in the\r\nabundance of your market magnificent, but in your national defenses\r\nridiculous. [Footnote: The whole of the foregoing passage is taken, with\r\nsome little variation, from the speech on the Chersonese. It certainly\r\nwould seem strange, if this Oration had been forged by any grammarian,\r\nthat he should have borrowed thus by wholesale from Demosthenes. There\r\nis perhaps less difficulty in the supposition that Demosthenes repeated\r\nhis own words.]\r\n\r\nSome of our orators, I observe, take not the same thought for you as for\r\nthemselves. They say that you should keep quiet, though you are injured;\r\nbut they can not themselves keep quiet among you, though no one injures\r\nthem. Come, raillery apart, suppose you were thus questioned,\r\nAristodemus, [Footnote: This man was a tragic actor, and charged by\r\nDemosthenes with being a partisan of Philip. He was the first person who\r\nproposed peace with Macedonia, shortly before the embassy of ten. See\r\nthe Argument to the Oration on the Peace.]--\"Tell me, as you know\r\nperfectly well, what every one else knows, that the life of private men\r\nis secure and free from trouble and danger, while that of statesmen is\r\nexposed to scandal [Footnote: I have taken [Greek: _philaition_] in\r\nthe passive sense, as it is explained by Reiske and Schaefer, though it\r\nscarcely suits the character of the word. Compare Shakspeare, Henry V.\r\nAct IV. Sc. 1.\r\n\r\n  O hard condition, twin-born with greatness,\r\n  Subjected to the breath of every fool!\r\n  What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect\r\n  That private men enjoy!]\r\n\r\nand misfortune, full of trials and hardships every day, how comes it\r\nthat you prefer, not the quiet and easy life, but the one surrounded\r\nwith peril?\"--what should you say? If we admitted the truth of what\r\nwould be your best possible answer, namely, that all you do is for honor\r\nand renown, I wonder what puts it into your head, that you ought from\r\nsuch motives to exert yourself and undergo toil and danger, while you\r\nadvise the state to give up exertion and remain idle. You can not surely\r\nallege, that Aristodemus ought to be of importance at Athens, and Athens\r\nto be of no account among the Greeks. Nor again do I see, that for the\r\ncommonwealth it is safe to mind her own affairs only, and hazardous for\r\nyou, not to be a superlative busy-body. [Footnote: All the translators\r\nhave mistaken [Greek: _ton allon pleon_], which is simply \"more\r\nthan others,\" as Wolf explains it.] On the contrary, to you I see the\r\nutmost peril from your meddling and over-meddling, to the commonwealth\r\nperil from her inactivity. But I suppose, you inherit a reputation from\r\nyour father and grandfather, which it were disgraceful in your own\r\nperson to extinguish, whereas the ancestry of the state was ignoble and\r\nmean. This again is not so. Your father was a thief, [Footnote: This\r\nseems to shock Leland, who spoils the pungency of the expression, by\r\nrendering it: \"Your father was like you, and therefore base and\r\ninfamous.\" Auger remarks: \"L'invective de Demosthene est fort eloquente,\r\nmais bien violente. L'amour de la patrie, contre laquelle sans doute\r\nagissait Aristodeme, peut seul en excuser la vivacite.\"] if he resembled\r\nyou, whereas by the ancestors of the commonwealth, as all men know, the\r\nGreeks have twice been rescued from the brink of destruction. Truly the\r\nbehaviour of some persons, in private and in public, is neither\r\nequitable nor constitutional. How is it equitable, that certain of these\r\nmen, returned from prison, should not know themselves, while the state,\r\nthat once protected all Greece and held the foremost place, is sunk in\r\nignominy and humiliation?\r\n\r\nMuch could I add on many points, but I will forbear. It is not, I\r\nbelieve, to lack of words that our distresses have been owing either now\r\nor heretofore. The mischief is when you, after listening to sound\r\narguments, and all agreeing in their justice, sit to hear with equal\r\nfavor those who try to defeat and pervert them; not that you are\r\nignorant of the men; (you are certain at the first glance, who speak for\r\nhire and are Philip's political agents, and who speak sincerely for your\r\ngood;) your object is to find fault with these, turn the thing into\r\nlaughter and raillery, and escape the performance of your duty.\r\n\r\nSuch is the truth, spoken with perfect freedom, purely from good-will\r\nand for the best: not a speech fraught with flattery and mischief and\r\ndeceit, to earn money for the speaker, and to put the commonwealth into\r\nthe hands of our enemies. I say, you must either desist from these\r\npractices, or blame none but yourselves for the wretched condition of\r\nyour affairs.",
