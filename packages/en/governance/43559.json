Appendix No. 5 (pages 42 to 46).\r\n\r\nIn November, 1860, in consequence of the numerous additional matters\r\nconnected with the new building, into which the vestry had now removed,\r\nrequiring the hall-keeper’s attention, the clerk reported that the\r\nmessenger’s duties were not satisfactorily performed, and the subject\r\nbeing referred to one of the standing committees for consideration, a\r\nyouth was appointed upon their recommendation at ten shillings per week\r\nto commence with.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the vestry have contemplated some alterations in the\r\nsalaries of the officers, and upon the application of Mr. J. E. Salway,\r\none of the office clerks, for increased remuneration, in December, 1860,\r\nreferred the whole question of their duties and salaries to the committee\r\nof works and for general purposes for consideration.  That committee for\r\nthe purpose of comparison, and in order to have some data before them\r\nupon which to form a satisfactory opinion, requested Mr. Tite, M.P., to\r\nmove the House of Commons for a return from each vestry and district\r\nboard in the metropolis, of its population; number of houses; extent of\r\nits area; aggregate length of its streets; and the value of property, as\r\nassessed to live county rate, and the poor rate.  The committee wished\r\nthis return also to show the number of meetings held during the year,\r\nwhether of the full board or of committees, or sub-committees; as well as\r\nthe names and salaries of the officers, with particulars of any other\r\nbenefits enjoyed by them: and that this information might be tabularly\r\narranged in the order of the amount of population of each place.  See\r\nAppendix No. 6 (page 47).\r\n\r\nMr. Tite however replied that Sir John Shelley had moved for such a\r\nreturn, referring to one similar to that printed at page 69 in the second\r\nreport, but as the return moved for by Sir John Shelley differed from\r\nthat suggested by the committee, in several important particulars, the\r\nvestry requested Mr. Tite to obtain the introduction into it of the\r\nadditional information.\r\n\r\nThe act for regulating the supply of gas to the metropolis rendered it\r\nnecessary that the vestry should consider the appointment of a Gas\r\nExaminer; and having themselves determined to put in operation in this\r\nparish the act for preventing the adulteration of articles of food and\r\ndrink by appointing an Analyst; a committee was appointed in March, 1861,\r\nto confer with Dr. Barclay as to his acceptance of the latter office, and\r\nthe terms upon which he would undertake its duties, having regard to his\r\ndiminished duties as medical officer of health.  This Committee was\r\namalgamated with one appointed subsequently, and specially, to consider\r\nthe duties and salary of the medical officer of health, to whom was\r\nreferred also, the question of the appointment of the gas examiner.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the heavy amount of the solicitors’ (Messrs. Lee and\r\nPemberton) bill for the year 1859–60, which included the greater part of\r\nthe law charges in the actions brought against the vestry by the London\r\nGas Light Company and Mr. Hornsby, the contractor, those gentlemen\r\nsuggested in the following letter to the vestry clerk that they should be\r\ntaxed:—\r\n\r\n                                   44, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, W.C., London,\r\n                                                           18th May, 1860.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir, We have given the subject of our Mr. Pemberton’s\r\n    conversation with you respecting our bill of costs, mature\r\n    consideration, and feeling the delicate position in which the vestry\r\n    are placed as trustees accountable to their constituents, we would\r\n    suggest that for the future all our bills be referred to Mr. Richard\r\n    Dax, of the Temple, barrister at law, for taxation, and to certify\r\n    the amount properly payable to us.  This course is adopted by the\r\n    Great Western and North Western railway companies, the Oxford,\r\n    Worcester and Wolverhampton railway company, the Shrewsbury railway\r\n    company, the Metropolitan railway company now in course of formation,\r\n    all of whom refer their solicitors’ bills to Mr. Dax for the\r\n    satisfaction of the shareholders, and we believe it to be the\r\n    practice with nearly all railway and other large companies; should\r\n    the vestry resolve to do so, we shall feel great pleasure in\r\n    submitting our bills to Mr. Dax, and being bound by his certificate,\r\n    as it is extremely distasteful to us that any doubt should exist in\r\n    the minds of the vestry as to the propriety or amount of any item\r\n    charged by us, which however there almost necessarily must be, from\r\n    the technical manner in which solicitors are obliged to make out\r\n    their bills.  We ought to add, that we have no sort of personal\r\n    acquaintance with Mr. Dax, who is the son of the late Master of the\r\n    Exchequer, and a well known author and authority on the subject of\r\n    solicitors’ costs.  Should the vestry adopt our suggestion, we must\r\n    ask to be allowed to make out the bills now before them, afresh, as\r\n    they are not framed for taxation, and that in future, our bills\r\n    should be delivered half-yearly and paid within a short time after\r\n    they have been certified, and we remain, dear Sir, your’s faithfully,\r\n\r\n                                                          LEE & PEMBERTON.\r\n\r\nThe vestry, having accepted the proposal, returned the bills to the\r\nsolicitors as desired, and requested Mr. Finch, a solicitor and a member\r\nof the vestry, to attend the taxation.  This, after a strong protest from\r\nthe solicitors, he did; and the accounts amounting to £914. 3s. 5d., as\r\noriginally delivered, were settled by Mr. Dax at £998. 8s. 7d., including\r\nthe costs of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe law costs for the present year have been submitted to the same\r\nprocess, and have been certified by Mr. Dax to be correct at the amount\r\nat which they were sent in,—viz., £177. 1s. 6d.\r\n\r\nMr. Miles having been elected to preside at eighty-three meetings, out of\r\nthe one hundred and fifty-three held during the year, his services as\r\nchairman were again acknowledged by a vote of thanks on the twenty-first\r\nof May.  The thanks of the vestry have been also given during the year to\r\nMr. Perry on the eighth of May, for his exertions as delegate at the\r\nmetropolitan and county association for the equalization of the poor\r\nrates; and to Mr. Foy on the fourth of December, for the tasteful way in\r\nwhich the decorations of the vestry hall, on the occasion of the\r\ninauguration dinner were carried out by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix No. 7 (pages 48–49), represents the cost, during the past year\r\nunder the several sub-heads of paving, lighting, watering, cleansing,\r\n&c., and the provision made for meeting the same, by orders upon the\r\nboard of guardians.\r\n\r\nThe surveyor’s return upon this subject forms Appendix No. 8 (page 50).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAVING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cost of the item of paving during the past year, exceeding the\r\nestimate by four hundred and fifty pounds, has been unusually\r\nheavy,—viz., £3042 2s. 10d., after allowing for the sum chargeable to the\r\nseveral public companies and others for works executed for them.  This is\r\nabout twelve hundred and fifty pounds more than the cost of the same item\r\nof expenditure in the year 1856–7, after making the same allowances;\r\nupwards of four hundred pounds more than in 1857–8, eight hundred pounds\r\nmore than in 1858–9, and six hundred pounds more than last year.  It has\r\nbeen occasioned mainly by the purchase of the following materials, and by\r\nworks executed in the places hereinafter named:—\r\n\r\nBroken Granite for Roads                           £1558      7     10\r\nFlints for ditto                                     238      3      1\r\nGravel for ditto                                     137      0      6\r\nLombard and Duke Street . . .

The proceedings\r\nsince that date will be found in the Appendix to this report, No. 9\r\n(pages 51 to 55).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Metropolis Gas Act received the royal assent on the 28th August,\r\n1860: it contains fifty-seven clauses, many of them most important for\r\nthe protection of public and private consumers.  By the twenty-seventh\r\nsection of the act (23 & 24 Vic., cap. 125) the vestry are required to\r\nprovide apparatus for testing the illuminating power and purity of the\r\ngas, and to appoint a competent person as examiner; and by the same\r\nsection the gas companies are required to erect, at a distance not less\r\nthan one thousand yards from their works, experimental meters with the\r\nnecessary apparatus for testing the illuminating power of the gas\r\nsupplied.  In alleged compliance with this requirement the London Gas\r\nlight company have appointed a testing station at the house No. 73,\r\nBesborough Street, Pimlico.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes {8} observes with reference to this twenty-seventh section,—\r\n\r\n    “There was some discussion as to the propriety of making the\r\n    requirements of this clause compulsory instead of merely permissive.\r\n    After the fullest consideration however, it was thought essential,\r\n    with the view of avoiding discussions in vestries, and especially\r\n    with the view of counteracting the underhand and secret influence\r\n    which the gas companies exert in many vestries and district boards,\r\n    to make the clause compulsory.  There are many instances on record,\r\n    where powers are given to local authorities, and yet these powers,\r\n    although highly important to the public interests, have never\r\n    hitherto been exercised.  Hence an additional reason for positively\r\n    requiring them to provide apparatus, &c., for testing the gas, and to\r\n    appoint and pay an inspector for the purpose.  It is true that no\r\n    time is fixed within which the apparatus is to be provided and the\r\n    inspector appointed, but I apprehend it will be competent for any\r\n    ratepayer to compel, by mandamus, the performance of this duty by any\r\n    vestry or district board, within a reasonable time.\r\n\r\n    “The second section of the clause imposes an obligation on the gas\r\n    companies—namely, that each of them shall within six months erect at\r\n    the prescribed distance from their works, an experimental meter and\r\n    other apparatus for testing the illuminating power of the gas.\r\n\r\n    “Now these two obligations, the one on the local authorities of the\r\n    metropolis, and the other on the gas companies, must not be\r\n    confounded, because they are perfectly distinct, and the one is not\r\n    to be a substitute for the other.  In the first place each local\r\n    authority in the metropolis—_i.e._, each vestry and district board,\r\n    about thirty-eight in number, constituted under the Metropolis Local\r\n    Management Act, is to erect its own apparatus, and appoint its own\r\n    inspector; and from future clauses it appears that the act\r\n    contemplates a continuous and regular succession of testing by this\r\n    inspector, both for purity and illuminating power.  The evidence of\r\n    this inspector however as to any defects in the gas, will not be\r\n    conclusive until his report has been confirmed by testing the gas at\r\n    the prescribed distance of 1000 yards from the works.  Hence the\r\n    necessity for the obligation on the company.  The next clause will\r\n    better explain the mode of proceeding by the inspector, whenever he\r\n    finds the gas to be below the prescribed standard of illuminating\r\n    power.  With reference to purity there is nothing about testing for\r\n    this at the distance of 1000 yards, and therefore the test for this\r\n    may be made wherever the inspector pleases.\r\n\r\n    “With respect to the number of separate places for testing the gas,\r\n    inasmuch as there are thirteen companies included within the act, and\r\n    each must provide a testing house 1000 yards distant from their\r\n    works, there must evidently be not less than thirteen of these. {9}\r\n    But if each local authority also erects a separate one at some\r\n    central part of its district, thirty-eight of these will be\r\n    necessary.  A power is afterwards given for two or more local\r\n    authorities to combine, and then the number will probably be somewhat\r\n    diminished.\r\n\r\n    “All this necessity for a duplicate set of testing establishments is\r\n    rendered essential by the absurd requirement of the act as to testing\r\n    the gas at 1000 yards distance from the works.  Now as the erection\r\n    of this apparatus by the companies and the establishment of a\r\n    permanent testing place away from their works will be very expensive\r\n    to the companies, it is just possible they may be very glad to be\r\n    relieved from this expense, and may consent to the testing at the\r\n    establishment of the local authority being sufficient evidence of the\r\n    illuminating power as well as the purity of the gas.  This is the\r\n    more probable as it must be perfectly well known to the companies—at\r\n    least to their engineers—that so far as the company is concerned the\r\n    gas may just as well be tested in the centre of any district\r\n    supplied, as at the limited distance of 1000 yards from the works.”\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the fiftieth section of this act, the duty is\r\nimposed upon the Metropolitan Board of Works of raising the costs and\r\ncharges incident to its passing; and that board have accordingly levied\r\nunder their precepts upon the several vestries and district boards, the\r\nnecessary amounts for meeting the claims received.\r\n\r\nThe accounts sent in by the various parties were submitted to the proper\r\nofficer of the House of Commons for taxation with the following result:—\r\n\r\n    Accounts sent in.

But as the vestry has already contributed two hundred\r\npounds to Mr. Beal in answer to his various appeals, and expended upwards\r\nof twenty pounds in making experiments as suggested by him, they will\r\nhave a large sum to receive back\r\n\r\nIn November, 1860, a proposal was made by the vestry of St. James’,\r\nWestminster, to recognize the services of Messrs. Beal and Hughes\r\nthroughout the enquiry into the supply of gas to the metropolis, and the\r\npassing of the recent measure by raising some fitting testimonial, and a\r\ncommittee of that vestry having been appointed to carry it out, Messrs.\r\nHall and Perry were deputed to confer with them as to the best mode of\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nThe Bill to amend the Metropolis Gas Act, {11} introduced by the\r\ngovernment into parliament for transferring to the metropolitan board of\r\nworks, so far as regards the metropolis, the powers conferred by the acts\r\nfor regulating measures used in the sale of gas (22 & 23 Vic., cap. 66,\r\nand 23 & 24 Vic., cap. 146) upon the justices of the peace, of appointing\r\ninspectors of meters, having received the royal assent (24 & 25 Vict.,\r\ncap. 79), it will be the duty of that board to take the necessary steps\r\nfor carrying it into execution.  To aid in accomplishing this transfer,\r\nthe vestry on the tenth July, 1860, expressed their opinion that the\r\nappointment of inspectors of meters in the metropolis would be best\r\nplaced in the hands of the metropolitan board of works, and petitioned\r\nparliament and memorialised the justices of the peace upon the subject.\r\nSee Appendix No. 10 (page 56).\r\n\r\nThe number of public lamps in the parish on the 25th March, 1861, was as\r\nfollows—\r\n\r\nLighted by the London Gas Company      696\r\n,, Western ditto at Kensal Town         30\r\n                                       726\r\n\r\nWATERING AND SCAVENGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following tabular statement shows the cost of these two services for\r\nthe last five years:—\r\n\r\nFrom March to March.

An alteration in the form of the contract as to the mode of\r\nexecuting the works by which the parish is divided into daily districts,\r\nwas made during this year, which has very greatly lessened the public\r\ninconvenience, and consequently the number of complaints.  See Appendix\r\nNo. 11 (page 57).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITARY MEASURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return of the proceedings taken by the vestry under the metropolis\r\nlocal management act and the nuisances removal act, as required by the\r\nformer statute to be published, will be found in the Appendix No. 12\r\n(page 60).\r\n\r\nForty-seven slaughter houses in the parish were licensed by the\r\nmagistrates in October, 1860, not one having been opposed by the vestry.\r\nA list of them is given in the Appendix No. 13 (page 61).\r\n\r\nThe tenant of No. 3, Queen’s Road East, having been detected in\r\nslaughtering upon his premises which were not licensed for that purpose,\r\nthe attention of the board was called to the subject, but as it appeared\r\nthat he had been acting under the impression that the premises were\r\nlicensed, in place of other proceedings, a letter of warning was written\r\nto him, and the offence was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe notices of the vestry having been neglected by Mr. Peter Augustus\r\nHalahan, owner of Nos. 1 to 10, Wickham Place, application was made under\r\nthe nuisances removal act to the magistrate and his orders obtained for\r\nthe execution of the necessary works; these orders being also neglected\r\nand nothing being done at the expiration of the time allowed, the clerk\r\nwas instructed to apply for the enforcement of the penalties provided by\r\nthe twenty-seventh section.  The defendant was fined thirty-six shillings\r\nand costs, and in default of payment was committed to prison.\r\n\r\nA manuscript copy of all the reports made to the vestry by the medical\r\nofficer of health during the year is sent to the metropolitan board of\r\nworks with a copy of this report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orders issued by the vestry, and the rates made by the overseers (the\r\nboard of guardians) thereunder during the year, have been as follows:—\r\n\r\nDate and Amount of Order issued by the Vestry.

Of the applications so made,\r\nfifty-nine have been granted, and four negatived.\r\n\r\nEight buildings have been commenced without previous notice to the\r\nvestry, and their builders having been summoned before the board for\r\nneglect, the explanations given by them, or their apologies, have in most\r\ncases been considered satisfactory.

A committee being formed for the purpose the necessary\r\narrangements were made, and on the thirtieth of November one hundred and\r\ntwenty of the most influential parishioners, presided over by Viscount\r\nChelsea, with the county members as their guests, commemorated the\r\ncompletion of a building, which it may be permitted the vestry to hope,\r\nwill be of service to the ratepayers and the parish.  The report and\r\nbalance sheet of the dinner committee is printed in the Appendix No. 18\r\n(pages 65–66).\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner the first public use of the hall was given gratuitously\r\non three days to the Chelsea, Brompton, and Belgrave Dispensary, and by\r\nmeans of an oratorio, “The Creation,” on one day; a lecture by the Rev.\r\nJ. B. Owen, of St. Jude’s Church, on another; and a concert on a third\r\nday, that useful local charity realised nearly one hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained a license for public music and dancing, the applications\r\nfor the hire of the hall were soon found to be so numerous that a\r\ncommittee was appointed to regulate the letting, and they drew up the\r\nscale of charges which was approved by the vestry, and will be found at\r\npage 67.  A debtor and creditor account in connexion with the letting of\r\nthe hall will be also found at pages 68–69.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important applications referred to the letting committee\r\nwas from the proposed Literary and Scientific Institution, that the suite\r\nof rooms on the east side of the building might be set apart for their\r\nuse.  The letting committee made a special report upon the subject, to\r\nthe vestry on the eighteenth December, and a deputation from the council\r\nof the institution, consisting of the Rev. F. Blunt, Messrs. McCullagh,\r\nLawrance and Mead, with Mr. Bull, the honorary secretary, had an\r\ninterview with the vestry.  The report which is printed at page 70, read\r\nin connection with the following resolution which was passed by the\r\nvestry, will explain the nature of the engagement subsisting between the\r\ntwo bodies:—“Resolved, that the suite of rooms upon the ground floor\r\n(east side) including the lighting and warming of the same, and the use\r\nof the Hall for forty nights during the year, including the lighting,\r\nwarming, and cleaning of the same, be let to the council of the\r\nInstitution for £50 per annum, payable half-yearly, from Christmas next.\r\nThe tenancy to be subject to six months’ notice of determination by\r\neither party at any time.” A debtor and creditor account for one winter\r\nquarter will be found at page 74.\r\n\r\nUpon the application of the vestry, Sir R. Mayne, the chief commissioner\r\nof police, appointed a standing for ten cabs at the King’s Road end of\r\nRobert Street, exactly opposite the hall; but unfortunately the\r\npost-office authorities were unable to comply with their request that a\r\npillar letter box might be placed near to the hall.\r\n\r\nThe vestry hall buildings are insured in the Union Assurance Office for\r\nsix thousand pounds; and the fixtures, fittings, and furniture, in the\r\nManchester Fire Assurance Office for seven hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nTen thousand pounds, the sum originally borrowed, not having been\r\nsufficient to complete the building together with the fitting and\r\nfurnishing, an application was made to the metropolitan board of works\r\nfor their sanction to a further loan of two thousand pounds; and as it\r\nwas necessary to accompany that application with a statement of the\r\nentire estimated cost, and to fortify it with a memorial from the vestry,\r\nthose documents, as they contain much matter of interest, are printed at\r\npages 75 and 72–73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER’S CREEK DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the last report the sum assessed by the metropolitan board of works\r\nupon this portion of the parish has been, for the year 1861, four hundred\r\nand seventy-nine pounds, eleven shillings and eleven pence; but the\r\nvestry have abstained from issuing their order to the board of guardians\r\nfor its collection.  They have, however, in consequence of the receipt of\r\nthe following letter, upon the recommendation of the Finance Committee,\r\npaid the amount for 1858:—\r\n\r\n                                              Metropolitan Board of Works,\r\n                                                1, Greek Street, Soho, W.,\r\n                                                       17th October, 1860,\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir,—I am directed by the metropolitan board of works to\r\n    acquaint you that they have directed their attention to the subject\r\n    of the amounts outstanding on their precepts issued to the vestries\r\n    and district boards of the metropolis, and they desire me to apprize\r\n    you for the information of the vestry of Chelsea, that having been\r\n    unsuccessful in their attempt to carry a measure through Parliament\r\n    in the past session for conferring upon the board the necessary\r\n    powers to deal with the question of the redistribution of the\r\n    Counter’s Creek charges, they have had under consideration the\r\n    subject of the payment of the amount due from the vestry on the\r\n    precept for the ordinary expenses of the board for the year 1858,\r\n    being the sum of £447 4_s._ 2_d._ payment of which was, as you will\r\n    recollect, allowed to stand over until the re-apportionments of the\r\n    debts of the Commissioners of Sewers had been discussed in\r\n    Parliament.  The board now feel that the time has arrived when it is\r\n    necessary that they should adopt measures for obtaining payments of\r\n    the amounts outstanding, and after an attentive consideration of the\r\n    facts of the case, and having regard to the arrangement with the\r\n    vestry in reference to the parish contributing to the cost of the\r\n    Counter’s Creek diversion sewer, the conclusion they have arrived at\r\n    as to the most convenient course to be adopted is, that the board\r\n    should proceed to appoint persons to make a rate on the parish in\r\n    default, for the amount due on the precept, and in the event of the\r\n    vestry continuing their objection to the payment, that some ratepayer\r\n    should then raise the question of the liability of the parish by an\r\n    appeal against the rate, on which a special case might be reserved\r\n    for the opinion of the Court of Queen’s Bench.  I am directed to add\r\n    that the Board have deferred further proceedings in the matter for a\r\n    fortnight from the date of their last meeting, the 12th instant, in\r\n    order to afford the vestry an opportunity of paying the amount in\r\n    question should they think proper so to do; and meanwhile I am to\r\n    request that you will be good enough to lay this letter before the\r\n    vestry, and to favor me with a reply with the least possible delay.\r\n    I am, dear sir, yours faithfully, JOHN POLLARD, Clerk of the Board.\r\n\r\nThe amount assessed for 1859, four hundred and fifty-six pounds, nine\r\nshillings and one penny, was paid by order of the board on the sixth\r\nDecember, 1859, before any portion of it was received from the board of\r\nguardians.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1861, the metropolitan board were very pressing for payment of\r\nthe amount for 1860 (five hundred and eighteen pounds, nineteen\r\nshillings, and one penny), threatening immediate proceedings if it were\r\nnot made before the 25th of that month; the vestry, however, appealed\r\nthrough Mr Tite against this undue pressure, contrasting with it, the\r\ntreatment received by the vestry of Kensington, who were in arrear many,\r\nif not all, of their instalments, and eventually the metropolitan board\r\nconsented to receive the amount of the precept for their ordinary\r\nexpenses of 1860 less this sum which was included in it.  Thus it is that\r\nthe sums assessed for the first four years have been collected in the\r\ndistrict, and paid to the metropolitan board; but for the two last, 1860\r\nand 1861, they have not been paid to the metropolitan board, nor have any\r\nsteps been taken to collect the money in the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estimate upon which the sums were originally proposed to be raised by\r\nthe metropolitan board of works for the services of the year ending the\r\nthirty-first of December, 1860, gives the following particulars as\r\napplicable to this parish:—\r\n\r\n                                    £      _s._   _d._\r\nSewerage and Drainage                1168     17      1\r\nMetropolis Improvements               411      5      2\r\nGeneral Purposes, viz.:—\r\n     Salaries, Wages, &c.             271     16      8\r\n     Printing, Stationery, &c.         45     14      6\r\n     Rent, Taxes, &c.                  23      9      0\r\nRepayment of Loans, &c., special:—\r\n     Principal                        283     12      5\r\n     Interest                         272     17      5\r\nDitto ditto, general:—\r\n     Clergy Mutual, £140,000          255     15      2\r\n     Bank of England, £400,000        351     14     10\r\n     Clergy Mutual, £42,000            31     16      1\r\n     Contingencies                     40      0     11\r\n                                    £3156     19      3\r\n\r\nThis estimate, however, having been printed and sent to the various\r\nvestries and district boards, underwent considerable discussion and some\r\nmodifications, the principal of which latter, were, that instead of\r\nincluding the whole cost of the new buildings in Spring Gardens in the\r\nprecepts for 1860, it was determined to spread it over three years; an\r\nitem of £20,000 for deodorization was reduced to £10,000; the amount for\r\nspecial charges was reduced by £5,000; and the sum of £2,000 was\r\nsubstituted for £5,000 for minor improvements.  These alterations, with a\r\ncredit of £364 10s. 10d. (the remaining portion of the £3053 16s. 3d.\r\nadverted to in former reports), had the effect of diminishing the amount\r\nrequired from this parish to £2239 10s. 9d., and it was thus apportioned\r\nby the precept dated 11th May, 1860:—\r\n\r\n                                 £      _s._   _d._\r\nThe Whole Parish                  1004     13      3\r\nThe Counters Creek District        518     19      1\r\nThe Ranelagh District              715     18      5\r\n                                 £2239     10      9\r\n\r\nIn September, the third precept for the Main Drainage rate was received,\r\namounting to £2928 2s.; and in the following February the ordinary\r\nprecept for 1861, £2580 1s. 4d.; therefore within the period comprised in\r\nthis report this parish has been required to provide for metropolitan\r\npurposes the large sum of £7,747 14s. 1d.\r\n\r\nThe orders made by the vestry in pursuance of these precepts, and the\r\nrates made by the board of guardians thereunder, are shewn in the\r\nfollowing table:—\r\n\r\n Date and amount of Order of Vestry.

The first of them, after great delays, passed through\r\nthe House of Commons on the nineteenth of July, 1861, and was read a\r\nfirst time in the House of Lords on the twenty-second of that month, but\r\nin consequence of the advanced period of the session, it was found\r\nimpossible to procure its passage through the required stages in order to\r\nits becoming law this year.  The bill No. 2, having relation to the Rock\r\nLoan, being strongly opposed by certain members of the House of Commons,\r\nwas withdrawn.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the abortive bill of 1860, the solicitors of the\r\nmetropolitan board reported: “We think it will be nearly correct to\r\nestimate the expense to the board, exclusive of printing, &c. by the\r\nprinters of the board, and expenses of that kind, at about £1650.”  It is\r\nto be hoped that the failure of 1861 will be somewhat less costly.\r\n\r\nThe vestry of Chelsea have at various times responded to the invitation\r\nof the metropolitan board for suggestions during the preparation of the\r\nseveral bills for amending the Metropolis Local Management Act; for\r\nconvenience of reference, their labours in this respect will be found in\r\nthe Appendix No. 19, (pages 77 to 103).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHELSEA CHARITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second of May, 1860, upon the motion of Mr. Finch, a\r\ncommittee, consisting of the rector (the Rev. A. G. W. Blunt), the\r\nchurchwardens (Dr. Diplock and Mr. Collier), three past churchwardens\r\n(Messrs. Hall, Perry, and Leete), and Messrs. Whitehead, Jones, Miles,\r\nBrown, Rabbits, E. O. Symons, Till, and Finch, was appointed to enquire\r\ninto the charities of the parish, the present particulars of the several\r\nproperties, and the application of the respective annual proceeds\r\nthereof, and to report thereon.  At the same time, the vestry clerk\r\nreported that, at the request of the rector, he was making arrangements\r\npreliminary to the appointment of new trustees, and laid before the\r\nvestry the following letter from Mr. Druce:\r\n\r\n                                                                Mr. Lahee,\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir, Doubtless you are aware that the information contained in\r\n    last Saturday’s “Chelsea Times” {20} was provided by me, as far as\r\n    concerned the Chelsea charities.\r\n\r\n    The article of this morning {20} would lead me to suppose that it was\r\n    taken to be the opinion of the writer of such information that under\r\n    present circumstances it would be to the advantage of the parish that\r\n    the vestry clerk should be a solicitor; nothing can be more foreign\r\n    to my opinion, and without compliment, I think the office is now in\r\n    very good hands.  In the wicked old tory times on Easter Tuesday, a\r\n    man might blow out the steam of discontent, and tell a few truths\r\n    profitable to the parish to hear; now a few highly honourable and\r\n    sensible parishioners ‘make things pleasant’ in a comfortable room in\r\n    a house in the King’s Road.  The money of the parish charities is not\r\n    properly looked after; for many months I have been trying to get the\r\n    late rector to put matters to rights, but without avail.  Being\r\n    therefore left sole trustee for some portion, and knowing more than\r\n    most, about the parish school and trust funds, I thought I was the\r\n    proper person to light the match.  Should the vestry appoint the\r\n    committee on charity affairs, I shall be happy to attend their\r\n    summons to give them any information in my power: and I think they\r\n    ought to have a committee, both on this subject and that of the\r\n    church trustees, and at least chronicle the exact state of facts;\r\n    for, seriously speaking, we owe ‘liberal opinions’ no small grudge\r\n    for shutting up Easter Tuesday.  I do not recollect that in your\r\n    charity report {21} you mentioned the large sums belonging to the\r\n    charity schools, if you did, the vestry ought to have seen that the\r\n    trustees were dying out.  From my experience of the working of the\r\n    parish charities, schools, &c., I am quite convinced that the vestry\r\n    should annually qualify themselves to issue a report on all charity\r\n    money.  I have never found anything to make me think otherwise than\r\n    favourably of the honesty of all dealings with the charity money, but\r\n    I have found abundant reason to rest satisfied, that without some lay\r\n    assistance and watchfulness, all matters get into disorder,\r\n    especially where there are any accounts to keep.  This letter is at\r\n    your service, and may be used as you think fit.  I am, dear sir,\r\n    always yours very faithfully, WM. DRUCE.  Swan Wharf, Chelsea, 14th\r\n    April, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe committee, favoured occasionally with the assistance of Mr. Druce,\r\nand strengthened by the addition to it of Messrs. Butt, Tipper, and\r\nCallow, have met upon numerous occasions, and are carefully pursuing\r\ntheir enquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREMORNE GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that towards the close of the season of 1858, the\r\nvestry thought it necessary to remind Mr. Simpson, the proprietor of\r\nCremorne Gardens, of the arrangement made with them as to the conduct of\r\nhis gardens, particularly as to the hour of closing; and that Mr.\r\nSimpson’s reply, although dated the 16th of August, was not received in\r\nsufficient time to be considered until the meeting on the fifth of\r\nOctober, when it was thought to be unsatisfactory.  Last year the vestry\r\nagain moved in the matter, by reminding him of these promises, and\r\nrequesting to know before Monday, the tenth of September, whether it was\r\nhis intention to comply with their wishes and those of the parish, by\r\nclosing the gardens at twelve o’clock at night.  No reply having been\r\nreceived from Mr. Simpson at the meeting of the board on the eleventh of\r\nSeptember, it was moved by Mr. Delany that the report of the second of\r\nNovember, 1857, which the vestry had refrained from making public in\r\nconsequence of the pledge on the part of the proprietor, that the gardens\r\nshould be closed as near to midnight as possible, and that in other\r\nrespects he would meet the wishes of the vestry, and the comfort of the\r\ninhabitants, should be printed for the use of the vestry.  The chairman,\r\nhowever, having ruled that this motion was irregular, it was referred to\r\nthe committee of works and for general purposes to consider the whole\r\nquestion, particularly with reference to the effect, a change in the\r\nproprietorship, from an individual to a company, might have in increasing\r\nthe annoyance of the parishioners; and the report of the committee was\r\npresented on the twenty-fifth of September.\r\n\r\nThat report, which is printed at page 107, recommended the publication of\r\nthe report of 1857, and the presentation of a petition to the licensing\r\nmagistrates that the hour of closing might be made twelve o’clock at\r\nnight, as was the case with other public gardens.  A memorial from\r\nforty-four owners of property and ratepayers residing near the gardens,\r\nurging the vestry to act, was presented at the same time the report was\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nThe vestry then decided, by a majority of 17 to 6, to present the\r\npetition, but to withold the publication of the report of 1857; and the\r\nsolicitor being in attendance with a form of petition, which was\r\napproved, the seal was affixed to it at once, and it was duly presented.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of October, however, a day or two before the licensing day,\r\na communication was received from the solicitors, which induced the\r\nboard, on a division, by a majority of twenty-eight to eight, to pass the\r\nfollowing resolution:—\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that having regard to the communication now made by the\r\n    solicitors, from which it appears that the necessary evidence in\r\n    support of the petition cannot be obtained upon the present occasion,\r\n    the solicitors be instructed not to incur any further expense in the\r\n    matter, on the understanding that if the gardens should be kept open\r\n    after twelve at night, and the nuisance, annoyance, and injury to the\r\n    parishioners continue, this board, will in sufficient time next year\r\n    consider the necessary steps to be taken effectually to oppose the\r\n    application for the renewal of the license in 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE LOTS.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Lots,” a parcel of land so called lying on the banks of the river\r\n{23a} in front of Ashburnham House, comprises about four acres, and is\r\nthe meadow ground formerly allotted to Sir Arthur Gorges by the Lord of\r\nthe Manor, in lieu of his right of common. {23b}  These are, and have\r\nbeen for centuries, the Chelsea Lammas Lands, and have hitherto been\r\naccustomed to be opened on the twelfth of August, being the first day of\r\nthe month according to the Old Style.  The graziers, butchers, and\r\nothers, with their cattle, used formerly to assemble in the lane leading\r\nto “The Lots” on the eve of Lammas, and when the clock had struck twelve\r\nthey entered upon the meadow.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of a committee, printed at page 108, appointed by the\r\nvestry in the year 1834 to investigate the state of these town meadows,\r\nwhen it was necessary _vi et armis_ to reassert the invaded privileges of\r\nthe inhabitants, it appears that “‘The Lots’ are Lammas land, and have\r\nbeen for ages appurtenant to the manor of Chelsea.  The Lord of the Manor\r\npossesses the right of letting the land on lease for the spring and\r\nautumn quarters, beginning with March and ending in August; and the\r\ninhabitants at large enjoy the privilege of turning in their cattle from\r\nAugust till February, being the autumn and winter quarters.”  Railways,\r\nhowever, and acts of parliament for smoothing down difficulties in their\r\nway, have sprung up since those pastoral clays; and the Lord of the Manor\r\nhaving sold his freehold to a railway company, the clerk called the\r\nattention of the vestry, on the 8th of May, 1860, to the following\r\nadvertisement:—\r\n\r\n    West London Extension Railway Company.—Notice is hereby given, that a\r\n    Meeting of the Householders, Inhabitants, and Land-owners of the\r\n    Parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex, and other\r\n    persons interested in the Lammas Lands called “The Lots,” in the said\r\n    Parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, will be held at the house of Mr. John\r\n    Sparks Alexander situate in Cremorne Road, in the said parish, and\r\n    known by the name or sign of the ‘King’s Arms,’ on Wednesday, the 9th\r\n    day of May next, at Eleven o’clock in the forenoon, for the purpose\r\n    of appointing a Committee to treat with the Company for the\r\n    compensation to be paid by them for the extinction of the Lammas and\r\n    other Commonable Rights, in or over certain land called ‘The Lots’ in\r\n    the said parish of St. Luke, Chelsea, and which is required by the\r\n    Company for the purposes of the ‘West London Extension Railway.  Act,\r\n    1859.’—Dated the 27th day of April, 1860.—EDWARD BELLAMY, Secretary\r\n    of the Company.\r\n\r\nA meeting took place consequently on the 9th of May, at which the\r\nfollowing resolution was passed:—\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that Messrs. William Hall (church warden), John Perry,\r\n    James Miles, George Wevell Richards, and William Whitehead, being\r\n    five of the persons entitled to Lammas or other Commonable Rights\r\n    over or in the piece of land called ‘The Lots Meadow,’ otherwise\r\n    ‘Chelsea Lot Mead,’ situate in the parish of Saint Luke, Chelsea, in\r\n    the County of Middlesex, and containing by admeasurement three acres,\r\n    two roods, and thirty perches, or thereabouts, and marked or referred\r\n    to in the map or plan, and in the book of reference of the West\r\n    London Extension Railway, deposited with the Clerk of the Peace for\r\n    the said County of Middlesex, by the number 10 in the said parish of\r\n    St. Luke, Chelsea, shall be, and they are accordingly, in pursuance\r\n    of the provisions of the ‘Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845,’\r\n    appointed to be a Committee having all such powers as by the ‘Lands\r\n    Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845’ are conferred upon Committees of\r\n    like description, to treat with the West London Extension Railway\r\n    Company for the compensation to be paid for the extinction of all\r\n    Lammas or other Commonable Rights over or in the said piece of land.\r\n\r\nThe important question of the boundaries of the parish has occupied\r\nconsiderable attention during the past year, and has been the subject of\r\na reference to a sub-committee of the committee of works and for general\r\npurposes, who have still the subject under consideration.\r\n\r\nVarious memorials and petitions have been presented during the year, to\r\nwhich, as they sufficiently elucidate the subjects of them, and are\r\nprinted in the appendix (Nos. 23 to 27) no further allusion need be made\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe “Public Indicator” erected in Sloane Square by permission of the\r\nboard in May, 1860, was removed in the fallowing March, in consequence of\r\nthe failure of the proprietors to light it at night, and to provide the\r\npromised clock.  It is retained in the custody of the vestry, under a\r\nclause in the agreement, as a lien for the expenses of its removal and\r\nmaking good the paving.\r\n\r\nPlans, books of reference, and parliamentary notices of the “London,\r\nBuckinghamshire, and West Midland Railway” (whose intended terminus was\r\nin the Pavilion grounds), and of “The London Tramway and Dispatch\r\nCompany,” were deposited with the Vestry, but both of their bills were\r\nunsuccessful.  Mr. Train also made an application to the vestry for\r\npermission to lay down his tramways in Sloane Street and the King’s Road,\r\nbut its consideration has been adjourned _sine die._\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of January, 1861, Mr. Finch laid before the Board a\r\ncopy of a “Bill to Transfer the Seats in Parliament forfeited by the\r\nBorough of St. Albans to the proposed Borough of Chelsea and Kensington,”\r\nwhich Viscount Enfield, M.P. for Middlesex had given notice of his\r\nintention to introduce in the House of Commons.  Immediately the\r\nGovernment {25} brought in their “Bill for the Appropriation of the Seats\r\nVacated by the Disfranchisement of the Boroughs of Sudbury and Saint\r\nAlbans,” which contained the following clause: “The parishes of Chelsea\r\nand Kensington in the county of Middlesex shall, for the purposes of this\r\nact, together form a borough, to be called the borough of Chelsea, and\r\nsuch borough shall, from and after the said first day of November, 1861,\r\nreturn one member to serve in parliament.”\r\n\r\nAn influential deputation from both parishes, accompanied by the two\r\ncounty members, had an interview with Lord Palmerston on the fifth of\r\nMarch, on the subject of the bill, and laid before his lordship various\r\nstatistical information (see appendix No. 29).  But on a division in the\r\nHouse of Commons on the tenth of June, the clause was rejected by a\r\nmajority of two hundred and seventy-five to one hundred and seventy-two.\r\nMr. Tite thus reported the circumstance to the board:—\r\n\r\n                                                       42, Lowndes Square,\r\n                                               Tuesday Morning, 1 o’clock.\r\n\r\n    My dear Mr. Lahee,—I never was so taken by surprise as by the\r\n    division I have just left.  The Government Bill was affirmed by two\r\n    large majorities, but when we came to the Chelsea question, to my\r\n    astonishment we were beaten by one hundred and three.  The house was\r\n    excessively impatient, and would hardly listen to anything; but it\r\n    appeared to me Sir James Graham, whom they would hear, said all that\r\n    could be said on the subject.  I was also astonished at some of those\r\n    I saw voting against us.  I will send you the division list as soon\r\n    as I get it.  The impression in the House _just now_ was that the\r\n    bill would be withdrawn, so in happier times we may have another\r\n    chance.—Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                             WILLIAM TITE.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—Rather sharp work for M.P.’s yesterday.  I was on a committee\r\n    from 12 to 4, in the House from 5 to just now; to-day we begin again\r\n    at 12, I suppose until 2 o’clock Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                                                   By order of the Vestry,\r\n                                                            CHARLES LAHEE,\r\n                                                           _Vestry Clerk_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX No. 1.\r\nLIST OF VESTRYMEN, AUDITORS, AND OFFICERS,\r\nWITH PLANS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE WARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_No._ 1, _or Stanley Ward_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll such parts of the said Parish of Chelsea as lie on the south side of\r\nthe boundary line dividing the said parish from the parish of St. Mary\r\nAbbott’s, Kensington, in the Fulham-road, and on the west side of a line\r\ndrawn from the point of the said boundary line in the Fulham-road,\r\nopposite the middle of Upper Church-street, in a southerly direction,\r\nalong the middle of Upper Church-street, and along the middle of\r\nChurch-street, to the south end thereof, and thence in the same direction\r\nto the southern boundary of the said Parish of Chelsea, in the river\r\nThames.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESTRYMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreun, John Cowan, 6, Lower Sloane-street.\r\n\r\nDelany, James, 3, Albion Place, Fulham-road.\r\n\r\nFoy, William, 46, Paultons-square.\r\n\r\nGable, Isaac Cosson, 2, Belle Vue.\r\n\r\nGarner, Thomas Betts, sen., Mason’s-place, Fulham-road.\r\n\r\nHall, William, 22, Paultons-square.\r\n\r\nPerry, John, 7, Danvers-street.\r\n\r\nTipper, William, 7, Odell’s-place, Fulham-road.\r\n\r\nWood, William, “Adam and Eve,” Duke-street.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nD’Oyle, Henry, 190, Sloane-street.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF NO. 1, OR STANLEY WARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n              [Picture: Plan of Stanley Ward, Chelsea, 1860]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_No._ 2, _or Church Ward_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll such parts of the said Parish of Chelsea as are bounded as\r\nfollows:—that is to say: Bounded on the north-west side by the boundary\r\nline dividing the said Parish of Chelsea from the said parish of St. Mary\r\nAbbott’s, Kensington, in the Fulham-road, from the point thereof opposite\r\nthe middle of Upper Church-street to the point thereof opposite the\r\nmiddle of Marlborough-road;

The letter proceeded:—\r\n\r\n    The Council sincerely rejoice in the view taken by the Vestry of the\r\n    utility and benefit of such an institution to the whole body of\r\n    ratepayers, and whilst they would desire to fix their home in the new\r\n    Vestry Hall as a central point for their members, they do not for one\r\n    moment expect that any of the necessary expenses incidental to the\r\n    use and occupation of the rooms and hall should fall upon the\r\n    ratepayers, but the Council will most readily be prepared to pay\r\n    every such charge arising from the lighting, warming, or cleansing of\r\n    the same.\r\n\r\n    The Council are anxious to make the Institution a credit and a\r\n    benefit to the whole body of parishioners, and by fixing a low rate\r\n    of subscription, to enable every person, however humble his position,\r\n    to become a member, should he have the inclination to avail himself\r\n    of its privileges.  The rate of subscription to a large proportion of\r\n    the members would not exceed 3d. per week, the highest being one\r\n    guinea per annum.\r\n\r\nIn reply we informed Mr. Bull “that we were of opinion that £30 per annum\r\n(being the interest upon £1000) would be a fair sum, alike equitable to\r\nthe members of the Institution and the ratepayers, to be paid as rent for\r\nthe suite of rooms and the use of the hall one evening in the week, the\r\nInstitution themselves bearing the incidental expenses of lighting,\r\nwarming, and cleansing the same, as stated in his note.  That if the\r\ncouncil agree to those terms, and will make a proposal to that effect, we\r\nwould lay it before the Vestry for their approval.”\r\n\r\nThe Council then addressed to us the following letter, to which we have\r\ngiven the most attentive consideration:—\r\n\r\n                                             “19, Walpole Street, Chelsea,\r\n                                                         December 3, 1860.\r\n\r\n    To the Committee of the New Vestry Hall, Chelsea,—Gentlemen,—We beg\r\n    to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and to\r\n    thank you for allowing our Council the use of your room for their\r\n    weekly meetings.\r\n\r\n    The Council have taken into consideration the proposal of the Vestry\r\n    Committee for letting them the suite of rooms and use of the hall for\r\n    £30 per annum, as a rent for the same, besides paying all expenses\r\n    incurred for cleansing, warming, and lighting.\r\n\r\n    The Council are apprehensive that this proposal may prove a stumbling\r\n    block to their future progress!\r\n\r\n    The object of the promoters of the Institution was, to establish a\r\n    Literary and Scientific Society so comprehensive in its objects, and\r\n    at the same time so accessible to all classes, that it might possess\r\n    almost all the advantages of a free library, without its\r\n    inconveniences.\r\n\r\n    To accomplish this desirable end, the Council fixed a low rate of\r\n    subscription, so that the industrious mechanic might share the\r\n    advantages of the Institution, in common with all the other classes\r\n    of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n    In order however to meet the views of the Vestry Committee, so far as\r\n    the faithful carrying out of the above purpose will permit, and also\r\n    to expedite the arrangement between the Vestry and the Council, the\r\n    following resolution was agreed to at a special meeting of the\r\n    Council on Thursday evening last, the Rev. Frederick Blunt in the\r\n    chair:—\r\n\r\n    “Resolved,—That in answer to the letter of the Vestry Committee of\r\n    the 21st instant, the following proposal be submitted in lieu of that\r\n    contained their letter:—\r\n\r\n    “‘That the sum of £40 per annum be offered to the Vestry Committee as\r\n    the utmost that the Council can give consistently with the avowed\r\n    objects of the Institution, this sum to include the use and\r\n    occupation of the three rooms, with conveniences, on the ground floor\r\n    of the building, and use of the large hall once a week, together with\r\n    all expenses incurred for lighting and warming, the Council taking\r\n    upon themselves to keep in order the three rooms, leaving the\r\n    cleansing of the large hall in the hands of the Vestry.’\r\n\r\n    “The Council trust that the Vestry will take an enlarged and liberal\r\n    view of this proposition; and whilst the stated rent of £30 per annum\r\n    would be of infinitesimal value to the ratepayers, this sum, in\r\n    addition to the other charges, would prove a heavy burden on the\r\n    funds of the Institution, if it did not altogether put an end to its\r\n    future proceedings.—We are, Gentlemen, your obedient servants, Thos.\r\n    Bull, Markham R. Evans, Hon. Secs.”\r\n\r\nWe find that the cost of lighting, warming, and cleansing the hall and\r\nanterooms, and of warming and lighting the suite of rooms, will reach, on\r\na moderate estimate, £38 19s. (say £40) per annum, and we continue of\r\nopinion that if the Vestry undertake these expenses, the Institution\r\nshould pay in addition, for the reasons above stated, £30 per annum as\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nWe understand that an influential deputation will attend you this day\r\nupon the subject.  We therefore, as the application is for the permanent\r\noccupation of a portion of these premises, leave the ultimate decision of\r\nthe question respectfully in your hands.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nBLAZDELL            W.

by the 150th section they are enabled to erect a\r\nbuilding for parish purposes; and by the 183rd section they are\r\npermitted, with the sanction of your Honourable Board, to borrow any sums\r\nof money necessary for defraying such expenses.\r\n\r\nThat with reference to the purposes for which a building so erected may\r\nbe used, Mr. Toulmin Smith is of opinion that “under these words, (public\r\nconcerns of any parish, or of the inhabitants thereof) it will become\r\nmatter of obligation on the Vestry in the case of a single parish, and on\r\nthe District Board in the case of parishes combined in a district, to\r\nprovide for the expenses of public meetings, and those other similar\r\nmatters touching ‘public concerns’ which are now done irregularly and\r\nillegimately. * * * The words in the section are imperative,—these\r\nexpenses ‘shall be defrayed accordingly.’”  Again, “the most economical\r\ncourse will always be to make such a building a part of the erection for\r\nthe offices, &c., of the board, as has already been done in the case of\r\nSt. Pancras Vestry Hall, and in some other cases in the Metropolis.”\r\n\r\nThat acting within the discretion thus vested in them your memoralists\r\nhave erected a Vestry Hall, which is suitable in every respect for the\r\npurposes of your memorialists, and for the before-mentioned public\r\nconcerns of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThat as evidence that the large room was much required in this parish,\r\nand is fully appreciated by the inhabitants, your memorialists do state\r\nthat since its opening on the 30th November last, seventy meetings of\r\nvarious kinds have taken place therein, which may be thus\r\nclassified:—Religious and Moral, twenty-seven; Intellectual, twenty;\r\nSocial, Political, and to encourage the Volunteer movement, twenty-three.\r\n\r\nThat for nineteen of these meetings the use of the room has been given\r\nabsolutely without charge, and for the others a scale of payment has been\r\narranged by your Memorialists, which is in their opinion equitable and\r\nfair—and which has been submitted to your Finance Committee.\r\n\r\nThat the building erected by your Memorialists is plain and substantial\r\nin its character; the plan of it having been submitted to, and approved\r\nby, your Honourable Board before it was commenced, (which original plan\r\nhas not been departed from in any substantial particular) and will cost\r\n(excluding the cost of the site) the, not unreasonable, sum of Seven\r\nThousand pounds; being the original contract sum of £5630, and the\r\nremainder for extra and additional works, which your Memorialists fear\r\nare inevitable in all such undertakings.\r\n\r\nThat particulars in full detail of the estimated cost of the site,\r\nbuilding, fittings, furniture and sundries, have been laid before your\r\nFinance Committee, by your Memorialists, amounting in the whole to about,\r\n£12,000.\r\n\r\nThat your Memorialists are of opinion that the most equitable manner of\r\ndefraying the said expenses both for the present and future Ratepayers is\r\nby means of a loan, repayable with interest in twenty years, thus\r\nrendering the sanction of your Honorable Board requisite.\r\n\r\nThat the Large Hall is intended to be used for purposes of the Vestry,\r\nand in fact is now about to be so used for the election of Vestrymen\r\nunder the Act.\r\n\r\nThat although a portion of the premises is now temporarily made use of as\r\nReading Rooms, as stated in the letter of your Memorialists to your\r\nFinance Committee, those rooms will most probably be required for the Gas\r\nExaminer under the Metropolis Gas Act, and the analyst under the Act for\r\nthe Prevention of the Adulteration of Food and Drink of last session.\r\n\r\nThat your Memorialists under the 150th Section of the Metropolis Local\r\nManagement Act deem the whole of the buildings necessary and expedient,\r\nand under the 92nd section such buildings are fully authorized inasmuch\r\nas they are clearly used for the public concerns of their Parish and the\r\ninhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\nThat no further or additional rate, than was contemplated at the time the\r\noriginal loan of £10,000, was sanctioned by your Honorable Board, will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThat the following objects may be mentioned as showing the necessity of\r\nthe Vestry Hall:—A place of meeting for the local magistrates in petty\r\nsessions; a place for the public discussion of important local public\r\nquestions, as the Embankment of the River at Chelsea, the Enfranchisement\r\nof the District, the Removal of the Asylum Wall in the King’s Road, and\r\nthe Equalization of the Poor Rates.\r\n\r\nThat with reference to the remarks of your Finance Committee in their\r\nreport that their inquiries have satisfied them that the building has not\r\nbeen erected exclusively for the purposes of the Vestry, but for other\r\nobjects not contemplated by the Metropolis Local Management Act, your\r\nMemorialists submit that under the Act referred to, it is not\r\nimperatively necessary that buildings of this description should be\r\nerected exclusively for the purposes of the Vestry; and that the building\r\nerected by your memorialists has not been erected for any object not\r\ncontemplated by the said Act.\r\n\r\nYour Memorialists therefore pray that, as they, and the inhabitants of\r\nthe Parish represented by them, are of opinion that the expenses of the\r\nsaid Vestry Hall, &c., are in relation to the regulation, government, or\r\npublic concerns of this Parish, and of the inhabitants thereof, and that\r\nthe sum of £12,000 is necessary for defraying such expenses; and that\r\nsuch expenses will be best defrayed by a loan upon the credit of the\r\nrates, your Honorable Board will not deem it expedient to refuse your\r\nsanction to the additional loan of £2,000 already applied for.\r\n\r\nGiven under the common seal of the said Vestry, this 10th day of May,\r\n1861\r\n\r\n                                                   (Signed) CHARLES LAHEE,\r\n                                                             Vestry Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX No. 19.\r\nMETROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Suggestions for its Amendment_.\r\n\r\n                                   Offices,—Manor House, King’s Road, S.W.\r\n                                                         25th March, 1858.\r\n\r\nSir,—In connexion with the subjoined letter, I have been directed to\r\ntransmit for your consideration as a member of the Committee of Works and\r\nfor General Purposes, certain general heads for amendment.

And in case amends\r\nhave not been tendered as\r\naforesaid, or in case the amends\r\ntendered be insufficient, it\r\nshall be lawful for the\r\ndefendant, by leave of the court,\r\nat any time before trial, to pay\r\ninto court under plea such sum of\r\nmoney as he may think proper, and\r\n(by the like leave) to plead the\r\ngeneral issue or other plea or\r\npleas, any rule of court or\r\npractice to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\n3.—PROPOSED NEW CLAUSES, & SUGGESTIONS FOR THE SAME\r\n\r\n\r\nAny person who shall draw or drive any wheeled Bath or invalid chair, or\r\nperambulator, upon any footway or curb stone, shall be liable to a\r\npenalty not more than forty shillings.\r\n\r\nEvery person sweeping or placing, or causing to be swept or placed, any\r\nmud, dirt, rubbish, filth, soil, saw dust, shavings, straw, or refuse\r\nfrom shops, into or upon any thoroughfare, or into or upon any channel,\r\nor gutter on the side of any street, shall be liable to a penalty not\r\nmore than forty shillings.\r\n\r\nEvery person placing or causing to be placed any dung upon any\r\nthoroughfare, or in any stable yard or mews, except into dung pits\r\nconstructed to the satisfaction of the vestry or district board, as the\r\ncase may be, shall be liable to a penalty not more than forty shillings.\r\n\r\nEvery person who shall affix any posting bill or other paper against any\r\nstreet post, lamp post, or public lamp, shall be liable to a penalty not\r\nmore than forty shillings.\r\n\r\nEvery person who shall keep pigs upon premises, after notice from a\r\nvestry or district board to discontinue such keeping, shall be liable to\r\na penalty not more than five pounds.\r\n\r\nAnd be it enacted, That all doors, gates, and bars, not being underground\r\ndoors, hereafter to be erected within the limits of this Act, leading to\r\nany house, building, yard, or land, and which shall open upon or towards\r\nany public street, not being a stable yard or mews, shall be constructed\r\nso as to open into or towards such house, yard, building, or land; and if\r\nany such door, gate, or bar shall be constructed so as to open in any\r\nother manner, the person who shall have caused such door, gate, or bar to\r\nbe so constructed, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding forty\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\nAnd be it enacted, That if any such door, gate, or bar already erected,\r\nshall have been so constructed as to open outwards towards or upon any\r\npublic street, it shall be lawful for the vestry or district board to\r\nalter the same, so that no part thereof opening or when open shall\r\nproject over any public way.\r\n\r\nAnd be it enacted, That when any house or building, any part of which now\r\nprojects beyond the regular line of the street, or beyond the front of\r\nthe house or building on either side thereof in any street, shall be\r\ntaken down to be rebuilt or altered, the same shall be set back to the\r\nline of the street or the line of the adjoining house or building in such\r\nmanner as the vestry or district board shall direct for the improvement\r\nof such street, and when the next house or building shall not adjoin the\r\nhouse or building to be so taken down, but shall be separated therefrom,\r\nthen the same shall be set back to the line of such street: Provided\r\nalways, that the vestry or district board shall make full compensation to\r\nany such owner for any loss or damage he may sustain in consequence of\r\nhis house being set back according to the provisions herein contained.\r\n\r\nAnd be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for the vestry or district\r\nboard to allow any building to be advanced for the purpose of improving\r\nthe line of the street or place in which such building may be situate or\r\nany building adjacent thereto.\r\n\r\nAnd be it enacted, That the owner or occupier of every house or building\r\nin or adjoining any street within the limits of this Act shall, within\r\ntwenty-one days next after service of any order of the vestry or district\r\nboard for that purpose, put up and for ever afterwards keep in good\r\ncondition, proper and sufficient pipes to carry off the water from the\r\nroof thereof into the common drains or sewers.

Pollard, Esq.,\r\n1, Greek Street, Soho.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n _Extract from the Report of the Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry\r\n                        of the Parish of Chelsea_.\r\n\r\n                                                      22nd November, 1859.\r\n\r\nAt your last meeting I was requested to report upon a suggestion made to\r\nthis Vestry by the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of\r\nHealth, to the effect that you should unite with other vestries in the\r\nendeavour “to procure insertion in the proposed bill for amending the\r\nMetropolis Local Management Act, of a clause relating to the annual\r\nlicensing of Cow Houses.”  I was also requested to consider the propriety\r\nof extending the system of licensing to the keeping of pigs.\r\n\r\nWith reference to these two questions, I have to observe, that the\r\ngrounds upon which such a proposition rests are mainly two; viz.:, the\r\n_necessity for_ such a business being carried on where it now is, and the\r\nprobability that such a business may, if carelessly conducted, be a\r\nnuisance to the neighbourhood.  For by the very fact of the license being\r\ngranted, the option of endeavouring to remove the cause of nuisance\r\naltogether is entirely given up.  This authority is accorded to the\r\nmagistrate, by the Nuisances Removal Act, but is very rarely exercised in\r\ncases brought before the Metropolitan Police Courts, because it has\r\ngenerally been held that its powers were not intended to be used for the\r\nsuppression, but only for the regulation of offensive trades.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the keeping of cows throughout the Metropolis, a necessity\r\nexists from which, under present circumstances, we cannot escape,\r\nbecause, in hot weather, neither milk nor cream can be brought from a\r\ndistance in a perfectly sweet and fresh state, and at no time of year can\r\ngood cream be obtained from milk (as I am informed) after a journey.  At\r\nthe same time, cow houses badly kept in a town are liable to become a\r\nnuisance, 1st by effluvia from the building itself; 2nd, by accumulations\r\nof dung, and annoyances during their removal, of which we have had\r\nseveral examples in this parish; 3rd, by injury to the health of the\r\ncows, which will consequently yield a supply of unhealthy milk, or may\r\nbecome the means of diseased meat being sold at the inferior butchers’\r\nstalls.  Under such circumstances, it seems not unreasonable that the\r\nvestry should seek by conceding the necessity for their permanence and\r\ngranting a license, to place them more completely under the control of\r\ntheir officers.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n          _Letter from W.

Cap. 120.”\r\n\r\n                            COMBINED DRAINAGE.\r\n                           PIG STY REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nThese two matters formed the subjects of my communication to Mr. Pollard,\r\nof the 29th ultimo, and copies of them were on the same day sent to you.\r\nThey both have reference to the amendment of the Act, and were\r\nrecommended to the vestry by Dr. Barclay, the Medical Officer of Health.\r\n\r\n                                                                I am, Sir,\r\n                                                    Your obedient Servant,\r\n                                                              CHAS.

Lee and\r\nPemberton), dated 24th of April, respecting the Bill for the Amendment of\r\nthe Metropolis Local Management Act.  The Clerk laid upon the table 12\r\ncopies of the last reprint of the Bill, and reported that the Bill had\r\nbeen introduced the previous evening in the House of Commons by Mr. Tite,\r\nM.P.\r\n\r\nResolved,—That this Committee _do not_ concur with the Solicitors in\r\ntheir remarks upon the Bill accompanying their letter respecting the\r\nfollowing five clauses:—\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 11, enacting that any Vestry or District Board may pay the\r\nprecepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works out of any money in their\r\npossession, and reimburse themselves out of the Sewers Rate.  _Remark\r\nreferred to_:—‘We think this clause very objectionable; it appears to\r\ninvolve a breach of trust on the part of the Vestry.  Funds raised for\r\none purpose should not be applied to another; and the effect is to give\r\nthe Metropolitan Board of Works a first charge on every Rate collected.\r\nWhat does the Poor Law Board say to it?’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 13, enacting that if any Vestry, &c., neglect to pay the money\r\nrequired by the precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, that Board\r\nmay make a rate on default, without awaiting the expiration of the period\r\nfixed by the precept.  _Remark referred to_:—‘Two months is not enough,\r\nit should at least be four.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 41, relating to the case of a Vestryman—a member of a District\r\nBoard—not attending meetings for six months.  _Remark referred to_:—‘Or\r\ncommittee thereof.  We think this inexpedient.  The member should go out\r\nas if by rotation, and be ineligible for the vacancy so created.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 60, relative to contributions to the cost of main sewers and\r\nsewers built since January 1st, 1856, or hereafter to be built.  _Remark\r\nreferred to_:—‘Leave out these words (lines 32 and 33, ‘at their\r\ndiscretion’).’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 62, prescribing the regulations to be observed in making openings\r\ninto sewers.  _Remark referred to_:—‘We think this clause is better out,\r\nunless it is made to go further.  The Vestry should have power to alter\r\nold drains.’\r\n\r\n_Resolved_,—That if in the opinion of the Solicitors further powers are\r\nrequisite than are contained in the above clause, they be authorized to\r\nprepare such a clause.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_,—That this Committee _do_ concur with the solicitors in their\r\nremarks respecting the following ten clauses, and authorize them to\r\nprepare clauses to give effect to their recommendations.\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 22, relative to the recovery of moneys assessed by the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works on extra parochial property for payment of\r\ndebts.  _Remark referred to_—‘Instead of ‘a justice’ should be ‘two\r\njustices or a police magistrate,’ the same error occurs in other parts of\r\nthe Bill.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 42, providing that owners and occupiers of land may execute\r\ndrainage works at their own expense.  _Remark referred to_:—‘We think the\r\nsewer when built should vest in the Vestry.  It should be built under the\r\nsuperintendence of their Surveyor; and the party applying should find\r\nsureties for the performance of the work, under penalties, to be\r\nrecoverable as liquidated damages.’\r\n\r\n_Resolved_,—That in the opinion of this Committee the words in line 21\r\n‘hereinafter mentioned’ should stand, with the interlineation ‘_or_ that\r\nany Vestry may think proper to attach.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 48, prescribing the regulations to be observed on abandonment,\r\nalteration, &c., of designs for sewers previously approved by the\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works.  _Remark referred to_:—‘And in case they do\r\nthere should be a heavy penalty recoverable by action.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 66, empowering Vestries, &c., on neglect of owners, &c., to carry\r\nout works, pursuant to orders, to proceed for the penalties, or do the\r\nworks themselves, and recover the cost.  _Remark referred to_:—‘Line 27\r\nerase ‘person or persons,’ insert ‘such owner or occupier.’  Line 37\r\ninsert ‘or occupier.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 67, extending penalties to persons causing offences.  _Remark\r\nreferred to_:—‘And all penalties recoverable under this Act.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 69, empowering Vestries, &c., to compel supply of water to houses.\r\n_Remark referred to_:—‘We do not think this clause will work, unless a\r\npower be invested for making the expense a first charge; it will be\r\nnugatory and will cause useless expense.\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 74, empowering Vestries, &c., with sanction of the Metropolitan\r\nBoard of Works, to effect improvements within their districts, &c.\r\n_Remark referred to_:—‘We think this clause requires remodelling.  It\r\ndoes not go far enough.  We think the clauses for improving streets in\r\nthe Towns improvement Clauses Act should be embodied in this Act,\r\nparticularly sec. 67; and also the clauses of the Lands Clauses\r\nConsolidation Act, enabling the Vestry to take compulsory possession of\r\nland.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 75, enacting that buildings projecting beyond the general line of\r\nthe street, where taken down to an extent exceeding one half, shall be\r\nset back to the general line.  _Remark referred to_:—‘This should be\r\nextended to Vestries with the consent of the Metropolitan Board of\r\nWorks.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 78, empowering Vestries &c. to drain and pave courts, &c. on\r\ndefault of owners, in lieu of enforcing penalties.  _Remark referred\r\nto_:—‘The judgment when recovered should be a first charge on the\r\nproperty, with power of sale in default of payment, on three month’s\r\nnotice affixed on the premises.’\r\n\r\nCLAUSE 93, enacting that a Vestry or District Board may require payment\r\nof costs or expenses from an owner or occupier, and the occupier paying\r\nto deduct from rent.  _Remark referred to_:—‘We do not think the clause\r\ngoes far enough.  The Vestry to be properly protected against their\r\nenormous outlay, should have a statutable charge upon the premises for\r\nmoneys expended by them recovered by judgment.  We see no reason why the\r\nVestry should not have a power of sale something similar to that given to\r\nthe Commissioners of Police under the 74th section of the Metropolitan\r\nBuildings Act, 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 122; unless this is effectually done,\r\nthe annual loss to every parish which carries out the intentions of the\r\nMetropolis Local Management Act, must be considerable; the Act will\r\nbecome a dead letter, or Vestries must be protected from loss.’\r\n\r\n_Resolved_,—That the attention of the Solicitors be directed to the\r\ndiscrepancy between the marginal note to Clause 52, and the body of the\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_,—That the Solicitors do endeavour to obtain the following\r\nalterations:—Clause 90 in the Bill above referred to, line 29, omit the\r\nwords, ‘which may be unfit for the keeping of swine, or where the\r\nbreeding, feeding, or keeping swine may create a nuisance or be injurious\r\nto health,’ in order to insert the words, ‘within forty yards of any\r\nstreet.’\r\n\r\nLine 31, insert after the word ‘place’ the words, ‘or in any locality,\r\npremises, or place in such manner as to be a nuisance to other persons\r\nresiding near thereto.’\r\n\r\n_Resolved_,—That the Solicitors and the Vestry Clerk be instructed to\r\narrange with Mr. Tite as to the best mode of obtaining the above\r\nalterations in the Bill now before Parliament.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n              _The Vestry Clerk to W.

and the said\r\nMetropolitan Board of Works shall immediately send notice of the fact to\r\nthe Vestry or District Board by which such member was elected, whereupon\r\nwhich Vestry or District Board shall forthwith proceed to elect a new\r\nmember for the said Metropolitan Board in the room of the member so\r\nceasing to be a member as aforesaid; and such election shall be conducted\r\nin accordance with the 44th, 45th, and 46th sections of the\r\nfirstly-recited Act, so far as the same are respectively applicable.”\r\n\r\n2.—Provided always that in construing the 6th section of the\r\nfirstly-recited Act, in calculating the number of Poor Rate assessments\r\nin any parish, each house, or piece or parcel of land, tenement, or\r\nhereditament rated to the relief of the poor, shall be counted and taken\r\nas a separate Poor Rate assessment.\r\n\r\n3.—Notwithstanding anything in the said recited Acts or this Act to the\r\ncontrary, Be it enacted, that the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea, in the\r\nCounty of Middlesex, shall from time to time raise and levy the sums\r\nwhich they may require for defraying the expenses of executing the said\r\nActs and this Act, and shall for that purpose make separate equal pound\r\nrates upon their parish or part thereof, in like manner as overseers are\r\nrequired to do with respect to the sums for which orders are by the\r\nfirstly-recited Act directed to be made upon them by Vestries and\r\nDistrict Boards; and shall in raising such sums act upon the like\r\nprinciples, and have the like discretion, as provided in the\r\nfirstly-recited Act with respect to orders upon Overseers by Vestries and\r\nDistrict Boards, subject to the provisions of this Act, and shall for\r\nthat purpose have free access to, and be at liberty to copy or adopt any\r\nassessment to the Poor Rate in the said parish, or any part or parts of\r\nsuch assessment; and such Vestry shall have power to appoint a collector\r\nor collectors for levying the amount of such rates, and to pay him or\r\nthem such salary, poundage, or allowance as they may deem just and\r\nreasonable; and shall take such security from every such collector for\r\nthe due execution of his duty as they shall think reasonable and proper;\r\nand such collector or collectors shall proceed in the same manner, and\r\nshall have the same powers and remedies, and be subject to the same\r\nregulations and directions with reference to the levying of such rates,\r\nas if he or they were an overseer or overseers of the poor, and shall pay\r\nover the amount of such rates to the said Vestry or otherwise, as such\r\nVestry may direct; and such collector or collectors shall, when and in\r\nsuch manner as shall be required by the said Vestry, make out and deliver\r\na true and perfect account in writing, signed by him or them, of all\r\nmonies received by him or them, in manner provided by the 65th section of\r\nthe firstly-recited Act; and in default of his or their so paying over\r\nsuch moneys, or making out and delivering such account in writing, he or\r\nthey shall be subject to the penalties mentioned and contained in the\r\nsaid 65th section of the firstly-recited Act in the case of officers or\r\nservants failing to account for moneys received; and it shall be lawful\r\nfor the said Vestry by order in writing, to require the Clerk to the\r\nGuardians of the Poor of the said parish or other person having the\r\ncustody or control of any rate for the relief of the poor in such parish,\r\nor of any other rate or of any book containing a copy of any such rate as\r\naforesaid, to furnish within such period, not being less than seven days,\r\nas shall be limited in such order, a true copy of such rate for the\r\nrelief of the poor, or other rate or of such copy thereof, as aforesaid,\r\nor of such part or parts of the same as shall be specified in such order,\r\non payment or tender for such copy at the rate of sixpence for every\r\ntwenty-four names (inclusive of all the particulars in the several\r\ncolumns in the rate, so far as such particulars have reference to such\r\nnames respectively), and the said copy shall be examined by and signed by\r\nsuch Clerk, or other person, and shall be verified by his solemn\r\ndeclaration, if the said Vestry shall require the same, which solemn\r\ndeclaration any Justice of the Peace or Commissioner duly authorized is\r\nhereby empowered to administer, and any person having the custody or\r\ncontrol of such rate, or copy thereof, who shall refuse or neglect to\r\nmake and deliver to such Vestry or any person by them authorised to\r\nreceive the same, such copy or extract, or to make such solemn\r\ndeclaration as aforesaid, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10\r\nfor every such offence, and to a further penalty of £10 for each and\r\nevery day during which the said offence shall be continued, to be\r\nrecovered by a summary proceeding.\r\n\r\n4.—That in place of the 109th Clause, the following be inserted:—“The two\r\nhundred and thirty-fourth section of the firstly-recited Act is hereby\r\nrepealed, and in lieu thereof be it enacted, that all penalties or\r\nforfeitures payable or recoverable under the firstly-recited Act, or this\r\nAct, and all penalties or forfeitures recovered by any Vestry or District\r\nBoard acting as the local authority for the execution within their\r\nrespective parish or district of ‘The Nuisances Removal Act for England,\r\n1855,’ shall go and be paid in manner hereinafter mentioned, anything\r\ncontained in an Act made and passed in the session holden in the Second\r\nand Third years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter seventy-one,\r\nor in any other Act or Acts to the contrary notwithstanding;—that is to\r\nsay, shall go to the Vestry or District Board of the parish or district\r\nin which the offence was committed, or to the Metropolitan Board of Works\r\nin case the injury shall have been sustained by, or the offence committed\r\nin respect of that Board; and all sums which shall go to or be recovered\r\nby any Board or Vestry on account of any penalty or forfeiture, shall be\r\npaid to their treasurer, or into such bank to their account as they may\r\ndirect, and shall be applicable towards the general expenses of such\r\nBoard or Vestry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX No. 20.\r\nCHELSEA CHARITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Articles in the_ West Middlesex Advertiser _referred to in Mr.\r\nDruce’s letter at page_ 20, _in the Report_.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 7, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar position in which the parish of St. Luke’s, Chelsea, at the\r\npresent moment stands, induces every one interested to prevent by every\r\npossible means the occurrence of future discord arising from what may in\r\nafter years be difficult to correct.  Probably for many years, no period\r\nhas ever existed in which the parish of Chelsea has been more dependent\r\non the wise action of its patrons, property holders, and inhabitants in\r\ngeneral than at the present moment.  Circumstances having afforded us\r\nopportunities of acquiring much knowledge of its affairs generally, and\r\ndeeming that the kindest act would be to communicate some portions of\r\nthat knowledge to our fellow-parishioners, we venture to intrude the\r\nfollowing matters on their attention.  Our readers are aware of the\r\nmovement made with reference to the assessments, but they may also know\r\nfrom personal experience, the great difficulty of the question, and from\r\nhaving been for some years, careful observers of the actions of many of\r\nthose gentleman who bestow so much of their time and ability on parochial\r\naffairs, we are thoroughly convinced, that such matters are carefully and\r\nhonestly administered; and although the watchful check of the ratepayers\r\nand other Societies is very beneficial, we doubt whether much good would\r\narise from any material change.  The attention of the Vestry, and the\r\nseparation to some extent of church matters from the general interests of\r\nthe parish, has deprived its officers of the advantage of a “legal vestry\r\nclerk,” and thus the local authorities in whom are vested many of its\r\ncharities have lost their best and proper adviser, and many of the\r\ncharity interests are not in such a state as they should be in a\r\nwell-ordered parish; for instance, the sums of money belonging to the St.\r\nLuke’s, Chelsea, parochial school stand thus—\r\n\r\n£764 13s. 4d., the gift of Earl Cadogan, stands in the name of Lee\r\nJortin, Esq., and others, some of whom have passed away, and Mr. Jortin,\r\nis not so strong in health as his friends would wish him.\r\n\r\n£692 2s. 4d., the gift of Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Bryan, stands in the name of\r\nthe Rev. Chas. Kingsley and Philip Burrard, both dead.\r\n\r\n£100 the gift of Mr. P. Burrard, stands in the name of the Rev. C.\r\nKingsley and Mr. Walker, both dead.\r\n\r\n£450 the gift of Mrs. MacPherson,\r\n\r\n£445 14s. 7d., the gift of Charles Walker, Esq., stand in the name of the\r\nRev. Charles Kingsley and Mr. W. Druce.  Thus supposing the first to be\r\nin safe trust, the two next are without any trustees, and the two last,\r\nin the name of one individual, which is not as it should be.\r\n\r\nAgain, Chamberlain’s Charity is for educating boys in the parochial\r\nschool, and then apprenticing them; the Vestry elects the boys, and the\r\nparochial officers ought to do the rest, but the money is placed in the\r\nSavings’ Bank, and there we suppose it rests; there is a sum of money\r\nalso lying at the parish bankers to the credit of the Chelsea charities,\r\nwhich we much suspect belongs to this charity, this sum has been lying\r\nunused for many years: it is also the duty of the parochial officers to\r\nsee that the money paid for the benefit of the school children under Mr.\r\nFlood’s gift is properly applied: the treasurer of the schools cannot be\r\nexpected to apprentice the children, so this money also finds its way\r\ninto the Savings’ Bank.  It is in these cases that the loss of the legal\r\nVestry Clerk is felt, as from the nature of the present Vestry, and the\r\nlimitation as to powers of interference with church matters, renders the\r\nassistance of the able Clerk of the Vestry, as now constituted, of no\r\navail.  The question also of the Church Trustees is in a very peculiar\r\nstate; there is great uncertainty as to their powers.  A most careful\r\nexamination of the conflicting clauses of the Act creates great doubt as\r\nto whether the power of the Trustees to make a rate does actually expire\r\nat the present period, as is generally believed.  If their powers of\r\nrating do expire, they will find themselves with an important trust to\r\ncarry out without the means of performing their trust.  We think it would\r\ntend much to the well-being of the parish generally if the Vestry, on\r\nEaster Tuesday, were to appoint a committee to inquire and report on the\r\ncourse it may be desirable to pursue with respect to the Church Trust.\r\nIt must be the wish of everyone that the power to rate should cease\r\nabsolutely, and that we should never again hear of a church rate in the\r\nparish of Chelsea.  Possibly a short Act of Parliament, annulling the\r\npresent Board of Trustees, and putting an end to the Act, would be the\r\nbest mode of proceeding; thus leaving the Rector and Incumbent of the\r\nchurches and the Church Officers to take charge of their own interests,\r\ntaking the revenue of the church and making the best of it; the removal\r\nof the expense of the Board of Trustees, and a moderate contribution of\r\nthe congregations towards the expense of what may be called church\r\nluxuries would meet the necessity of the case.  Without great care and\r\nconsideration this matter may become a troublesome and annoying parochial\r\nquestion.  The old Rector has passed away, a new one has been appointed;\r\nlet us not forget that, amidst the doctrinal disquisition and rubrical\r\neccentricities of which we have heard so much, we have enjoyed, under the\r\nformer, a quarter of a century of religious peace, and let us hope that\r\nthe wise actions of the new one may tend to increase the affectionate\r\nfeeling so many of us hold for the memory of his father and grandfather.\r\n\r\n                      _Saturday_, _April_ 14, 1860.\r\n\r\nThough the name of Mr. LOVELAND is always spoken of with the greatest\r\nrespect as the former vestry clerk of this parish, yet we by no means\r\nwish to infer the necessity of a legal gentleman filling that office.  We\r\nbelieve that it could not be in better hands than it is, and we have felt\r\nit to be our duty, on more occasions than one, to express our warm\r\napprobation of the conduct of Mr. LAHEE.  Litigation will arise in every\r\nparish, and may be promoted to a very great extent by the appointment of\r\nattorneys, and even if it were not so they would get the credit and the\r\nobloquy, and therefore should not be placed in so unenviable a position.\r\n\r\nMr. Toulmin Smith says, ‘It may be safely stated, that it will be usually\r\nthe wisest course not to appoint a person of the legal profession to the\r\noffice of vestry clerk.  It is quite unnecessary to the discharge of any\r\nof his duties that he should be of that profession; while his being so\r\nhas a tendency to encourage a narrow technical mode of dealing with the\r\nduties of the parish, and very often indeed lead to litigation, for which\r\nthere is no real occasion whatever.\r\n\r\n‘Every parish should, however, have some known and confidential\r\nprofessional man of the neighbourhood, to whom it should refer on\r\noccasions needing professional action or advice.’\r\n\r\nAgain, in Brady and Mahon’s work on Parochial Law and Taxation it is\r\nsaid, ‘A custom has prevailed of late years of appointing attorneys as\r\nvestry clerks.  The numberless statutes by which parochial affairs are\r\nnow regulated, give something like a satisfaction to this practice, and\r\nthe conflicting decision of the courts of law on parish cases, would lead\r\nto a belief that none but a lawyer could be qualified for the office.\r\nBut whatever may be the cause, the fact appears to be unquestionable that\r\nsuch appointments have tended greatly to the increase of parochial\r\nexpenditure; for the professional gentlemen thus selected as vestry\r\nclerks, however unjust it may be to attribute to them obliquity, foul\r\nplay or evil designs very naturally carry with them into office a sort of\r\n_esprit du corps_ which leads to appeals to quarter sessions, vexatious\r\nremovals, litigious contests, journies half over the kingdom, the\r\ninevitable consequence of which is an enormous annual expenditure,\r\namounting, it is said, to something like one third of the total poor\r\nrates!’\r\n\r\nWith such statements as these emanating from lawyers it would be absurd\r\nto argue for the continuance of a practice fraught with such imminent\r\ndanger to the pockets of the parishioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX No. 21.\r\nCREMORNE GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Report of the Committee of Works and for General Purposes_.\r\n\r\n                            Board Room, Manor House, September 24th, 1860.\r\n\r\n                 To the Vestry of the Parish of Chelsea.\r\n\r\nGentlemen,—We, the undersigned, of your Committee of Works and for\r\nGeneral Purposes, beg to present the following special report upon the\r\nresolution passed by you on the 11th instant (25):—\r\n\r\n    “That the Committee of Works be requested to consider the whole\r\n    question relating to Cremorne Gardens as to past proceedings, present\r\n    injury and annoyance to the parishioners, and the probable increase\r\n    of such damage and nuisance in consequence of the proposed change\r\n    from one proprietor to a company; to report thereon, and the course\r\n    they would recommend to be adopted to mitigate, and, if necessary,\r\n    put an end to the evil.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to the first portion of the enquiry we have had laid\r\nbefore us, the whole record of your former proceedings, with the evidence\r\ntaken before the licensing magistrates in 1857, which we have attentively\r\nconsidered; and we are of opinion that the second report presented by the\r\nCommittee at that time contains much that is valuable, and only requires\r\nto obtain due publicity to have a great effect in diminution of the evils\r\nto which it adverts—evils which the unfavourable weather during the past\r\nseason has prevented from becoming so intolerable as during the seasons\r\nof 1858 and 1859, but which the return of a hot summer, and the intended\r\nchange from the direct responsibility attaching to one proprietorship to\r\nthe infinitesimally reduced responsibility of the individual shareholders\r\nin a public company would, in the opinion of your Committee, largely\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nNor, it is to be feared, would these evils be confined as heretofore to\r\nthe summer months, for the prospectus of the new company offers the bait\r\nto shareholders that the gardens may be made profitable during the winter\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nHaving regard therefore to the magnitude of the question with which we\r\nhave to deal, and the advice of a sub-committee appointed by us to\r\nconsult the solicitors as to the course to be pursued, we recommend that\r\nthe report before alluded to, be printed and circulated, and that a\r\npetition be presented forthwith to the licensing magistrates, praying\r\nthat the hour of closing Cremorne Gardens may be made twelve o’clock at\r\nnight, as has been the case with other public gardens, and that the\r\nsolicitors be instructed to take all necessary steps in that behalf.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n                                                       WM.

SANSUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX No. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Report of a Committee appointed to investigate the State of the Town\r\n           Meadows called_ “_The Lotts_,” _April_ 18_th_, 1834.\r\n\r\n    “We have seen the land, and behold it is very good.”—Judges xviii. 9.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman,—Agreeably to the Resolution passed at the last Board\r\nrelative to the appointment of a Committee to go and view the meadow-land\r\ncalled “the Lotts,” I have now to inform you, Sir, and the Committee at\r\nlarge, that we proceeded thither on Friday morning, and upon arrival, we\r\nfound the gates locked up; we, however, procured the key of the adjoining\r\nlands which communicate with “the Lotts,” of a woman who lives in the\r\nlate Mr. Brown’s cottage.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding to the western extremity of the meadow, we found that a\r\nlarge bank had been thrown up at the time of the cutting of the canal,\r\nand that by this means perhaps one fourth part of the land had been lost,\r\nor taken away to widen the canal; but we were of opinion that this bank\r\nmight be gradually levelled and sloped down on the meadow below, so as to\r\nelevate it, and render it free from inundation, and thus make it more fit\r\nfor any kind of cultivation or pasture.  And we were all moreover\r\nunanimously of opinion, that it would be highly desirable to obtain\r\nre-possession of this valuable piece of land for the use of the\r\nparishioners.\r\n\r\nNo determination, however, as to the means by which this most desirable\r\nobject could be effected was formed on this occasion, and I am humbly of\r\nopinion that the Committee must continue their earnest endeavours, in\r\norder to obtain all possible evidence upon this difficult and complicated\r\ncase.  It seems proper to observe, in this stage of the business, that\r\n“the Lotts” are Lammas Land, and have been for ages appurtenant to the\r\nManor of Chelsea.  The Lord of the Manor possesses the right of letting\r\nthe land on lease, for the Spring and Summer quarters, beginning with\r\nMarch and ending in August; and the inhabitants at large enjoy the\r\nprivilege of turning in their cattle from August till February, being the\r\nAutumn and Winter quarters.  This state of appropriation continued till\r\nthe year 1825 or 1826, when the Directors of the Kensington Canal Company\r\ntook unlawful possession of them for their own use, immediately upon the\r\ncompletion of their Canal; and they have illegally detained them ever\r\nsince, and have let them successively to several persons, and received\r\nrent for the same.  It now, therefore, becomes a question, by what\r\nauthority they have shut out the ancient inhabitants, landowners, and\r\nhouseholders from their undoubted privilege of turning in their cattle to\r\ngraze, a privilege which they have uninterruptedly enjoyed for a\r\nsuccession of ages, and which they are confident has never been on their\r\npart either invalidated or annulled.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be concealed on this occasion, that it has been\r\nconfidently reported from many quarters that money was offered to the\r\nparishioners for the surrender of their rights to these lands, by the\r\nDirectors of the Canal Company; and that money was accepted by the\r\nChurchwardens of that time; for their Act of Parliament specially\r\ndeclares that the Churchwardens, Overseers, and four Freeholders\r\nappointed in Vestry, only shall receive and be accountable for all monies\r\npaid for land under this act.\r\n\r\nBut after the most diligent enquiry relative to any money transactions,\r\nor to the execution of any bond, or deed, or lease, or assignment, we\r\nhave the affirmation in writing of one of the then Churchwardens, denying\r\nthe receipt of any money, or compensation whatever; and as this\r\nChurchwarden is a man of probity, we are, of course, bound to place every\r\ndegree of confidence in his averment.  It is also necessary to mention,\r\nthat the Directors of the Kensington Canal Company have become bankrupt\r\nsince the completion of the Canal, and that any legal proceedings on our\r\npart to endeavour to obtain any money from them, either as compensation\r\nfor damages done to the lands, or for rent, would only involve the parish\r\nin useless expense.\r\n\r\nYour Committee, therefore, after a most careful and diligent\r\ninvestigation, are of opinion that it would be prudent to wait patiently\r\nuntil the twelfth day of August next, and on that day those inhabitants\r\nwho have been accustomed to turn in their cattle to graze, should proceed\r\nthither with some horses and cows, preceded by the Parish Beadle, Rector,\r\nChurchwardens, Overseers, and such Members of the Parochial Committee,\r\nand other inhabitants, as may think proper, and if upon their arrival\r\nthey find the gates locked up, they be ordered to break them open, and\r\nturn in their cattle as they have been accustomed to do from time\r\nimmemorial.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to apologize to you, Sir, for the length of this\r\nReport, and humbly to hope that the extreme importance of the case\r\naffecting the ancient and undoubted privileges of the inhabitants of this\r\nParish will form a sufficient apology; and finally, permit me to hope,\r\nSir, that you and every other Member of this Committee will cordially and\r\nzealously assist me in my earnest endeavours to obtain the re-possession\r\nof these lands.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, unanimously, that the thanks of the Committee be given to Mr.\r\nFaulkner for his able Report, and that it be entered in the Minute Book,\r\nand printed and circulated throughout the Parish.\r\n\r\n                                                 J.

PURDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE AUDITORS, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, have audited the accounts of the Vestry of St. Luke,\r\nChelsea, for the year expiring 25th March, 1861, and allowed the same\r\nexcept the item of £21 14s. 9d., charged as the deficiency on the\r\n“Inauguration Dinner,” which after mature consideration we are of\r\nopinion, cannot properly be charged against the Vestry funds.\r\n\r\nWe find the sum of £533 6s. 8d., amount of Precept dated 8th March, 1856,\r\nuncollected and carried forward from year to year, and would suggest,\r\nthat such item be disposed of, by payment being enforced, or the amount\r\nwritten off.  There does not appear to be any examination of the amount\r\ndrawn by the Surveyor for, and that paid to, labourers, and although\r\nattention to this has been drawn by the auditors of the last year’s\r\naccounts, no alteration seems to have been made.  We think that the\r\nInspector of the Roads should sign the Surveyor’s wages book each week,\r\nin testimony of the number of men charged for, having been employed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we desire to state our thorough satisfaction with the mode\r\nin which the accounts are kept, and to express our full appreciation of\r\nthe courtesy and assistance received from Mr. Lahee during our audit of\r\nsuch accounts.\r\n\r\nTo the Vestry of St. Luke, Chelsea.\r\n\r\n                                                               G.

Two clear days’ notice of every alternate Vestry Meeting (as\r\nhereinafter explained) shall be sent by the Vestry Clerk to each\r\nVestryman, at his usual or last known place of abode; and such notice\r\nshall state the time and place of such meeting, and the business to be\r\ntransacted, so far as the same is known, in its appointed order.\r\nProvided that whenever the period of adjournment renders two days’ notice\r\nimpracticable, notice shall be sent as early as possible.\r\n\r\n2.  Meetings of the Vestry shall be held every TUESDAY at three o’clock\r\nin the afternoon.  But the Vestrymen shall be summoned only for every\r\nalternate Tuesday for general business.

Every Vestryman, before taking part in any business at a Vestry\r\nMeeting, shall sign his name in the Vestrymen’s Attendance Book, to be\r\nplaced at the entrance for that purpose.\r\n\r\n4.  If at the end of half an hour from the time stated in the Notice\r\nconvening the Meeting there should not be nine Vestrymen present, the\r\nmeeting shall stand adjourned until the following Tuesday, and the Clerk\r\nshall give notice accordingly.\r\n\r\n5.  The Chairman shall be elected at the precise hour stated in the\r\nnotice, or as soon as _Nine_ Vestrymen are present; and the first\r\nbusiness at ordinary meetings of the Vestry shall be the reading, by the\r\nClerk, of the minutes of the last Meeting, the Chairman shall move their\r\nconfirmation, and if unopposed, such minutes shall be signed by the\r\nChairman, by the Chairman of the Meeting at which the business recorded\r\nwas done, and by one other Vestryman who was also present.\r\n\r\n6.  No motion or discussion shall be allowed upon the minutes, except as\r\nto their accuracy, and any objection on that ground must be made by\r\nmotion, and no motion either for signing or non-signing the minutes shall\r\nbe admissable.\r\n\r\n7.  The business shall be proceeded with, after the reading of the\r\nminutes, in the following order, viz.:—\r\n\r\n(1.)

Clerk’s Report.\r\n\r\n8.  The following shall be deemed motions of course, and may be moved\r\nwithout notice, viz.: Motions for appointing a Chairman; for the\r\nadjournment of any Vestry Meeting; for receiving, entering on Minutes,\r\nadopting and carrying out, or referring back, any Report; for reading or\r\nanswering any correspondence or other documents; for hearing any\r\napplicant or evidence; for the precedence of any particular business; for\r\nappointing any Members of Committees; for the admission or removal of any\r\nperson or persons (not being a Vestryman or Vestrymen) to or from the\r\nVestry Hall; and all unopposed motions.  Notice of all other motions must\r\nbe given as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n9.  Every Notice of Motion shall be written in a book to be kept for the\r\npurpose, and called the “Notice of Motions Book,” by the Vestryman giving\r\nsuch notice, who shall sign his name, together with the date of his\r\nsignature, which date shall be at least seven days before the time fixed\r\nfor the next meeting; and no Notice of Motion shall be altered or\r\nwithdrawn after such signature, without leave of the Board.\r\n\r\n10.  All Notices of Motion, duly entered in such Notice Book, shall be\r\nprinted in the Notice of the next ordinary Vestry Meeting, in the order\r\nof their entry.\r\n\r\n11.  Any motion, of which notice has been given, shall be proposed by the\r\nVestryman who has given the notice; but in case of absence he may depute\r\nto another Vestryman his right to move, or any other Vestryman may bring\r\nforward such motion, or move a negative thereto.\r\n\r\n12.  Every motion and amendment must be in writing, and must be seconded\r\nbefore it can be discussed or put to the vote.\r\n\r\n13.  One amendment only shall be allowed at the same time; but whenever\r\nan amendment is lost, a further amendment may be moved.\r\n\r\n14.  In speaking in Vestry, Vestrymen are to rise, and address the Chair.\r\n\r\n15.  Any Vestryman is entitled to take the Chairman’s decision on a point\r\nof order at any time.\r\n\r\n16.  If two or more Vestrymen rise to speak at the same time, the\r\nChairman shall decide to whom the priority shall be given.\r\n\r\n17.  A Vestrymen is not to speak more than once on the same motion,\r\namendment, or point of order, unless it be in explanation, or (by leave\r\nof the Chairman) in answer to observations of a personal character, or on\r\na call from the Chairman; provided that the mover of a motion shall be\r\nentitled to reply, but shall not introduce new matter; and any Vestrymen\r\nhaving proposed or seconded a motion or amendment, shall be considered as\r\nhaving spoken thereon.\r\n\r\n18.  The Chairman shall enforce such of the Bye Laws as may be necessary\r\nfor the preservation of order, and his decision upon all points of order\r\nshall be final.\r\n\r\n19.  All questions (except where voting by ballot is provided) shall be\r\ndetermined by show of hands, or division, if demanded.\r\n\r\n20.  When a division is demanded, the Chairman shall require the\r\nVestrymen who are in favour of the affirmative of the question to go to\r\nthe right of the Chair, and those in favour of the negative to the left;\r\nand shall appoint four Vestrymen as tellers—two from each side of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n21.  Printed lists of the names of the Vestrymen, in alphabetical order,\r\nshall be provided for the tellers, two of whom (one from the “Noes” and\r\none from the “Ayes”) shall tell from each side of the question, by\r\nmarking off on such lists the names of the Vestrymen on such side, who\r\nare to pass between the tellers respectively for that purpose.\r\n\r\n22.  No Committee shall be appointed except by motion after due notice;\r\nand whenever the Vestry shall have resolved to appoint a Committee the\r\nnames of the Members of such Committee shall be proposed by the mover of\r\nthe Committee; provided that any other Vestrymen may thereupon move the\r\naddition, omission, or substitution of any Vestryman or Vestrymen as a\r\nmember or members of such Committee.\r\n\r\n23.  The election of all paid officers shall be by ballot; and no\r\ncandidate shall be eligible for election unless he shall have been\r\nproposed and seconded by Members of the Vestry; nor shall there be more\r\nthan one ballot for the same office.\r\n\r\n24.  Such ballot shall be by means of folding Balloting Papers,\r\ncontaining the name or (if there be more than one appointment of the same\r\ndescription) names of the candidate or candidates voted for, which papers\r\nshall be handed, by the Vestrymen voting, to the Chairman, or to some\r\nperson deputed by him, and deposited in a balloting box by the Chairman,\r\nor such person who shall count the balloting papers, and state to the\r\nBoard the number of them.\r\n\r\n25.  Any member of the Vestry objecting to a motion of which notice has\r\nnot been given, or to the immediate consideration of a report brought up\r\nby a Committee, may require the same to be placed on the paper for\r\ndiscussion at the next meeting, unless the Vestry Clerk or Surveyor shall\r\nstate that the subject is urgent, in which case the Board shall\r\ndetermine, by a show of hands, whether the same shall be immediately\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n26.
