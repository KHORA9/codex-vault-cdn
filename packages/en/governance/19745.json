It may be that\r\nthe labor thus imposed has oftentimes enabled the once active\r\nparticipant in great affairs submissively \"to entertain the lag\r\nend of his life with quiet hours.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of such at a great distance and along a\r\nhumbler path, I have attempted to write something of events of\r\nwhich I have been a witness, and of some of the principal actors\r\ntherein during the last third of a century.\r\n\r\nMy book in the main is something of men I have personally known;\r\nthe occasional mention of statesmen of the past seems justified by\r\nmatters at the time under discussion.\r\n\r\nWith the hope that it may not be wholly without interest to some\r\ninto whose hands it may fall, I now submit this slight contribution\r\nto the political literature of these passing days.\r\n\r\nA.

Large enterprises were\r\nundertaken, and the sure foundation was laid for much of\r\nexisting business conditions.  The South had recovered from the\r\nsad effects of the Civil War, and had in a measure regained its\r\nformer position in the world of trade, as well as in that pertaining\r\nto the affairs of the Government.  The population of the country\r\nhad almost doubled; the ratio of representation in the Lower House\r\nof Congress largely augmented; the entire electoral vote increased\r\nfrom 369 to 444.  Eight new States had been admitted to the Union,\r\nthus increasing the number of Senators from seventy-four to ninety.\r\n\r\nThe years mentioned likewise witnessed the passing from the national\r\nstage, with few exceptions, of the men who had taken a conspicuous\r\npart in the great debates directly preceding and during the Civil War\r\nand the reconstruction period which immediately followed.  By\r\nthe arbitrament of war, and by constitutional amendment, old\r\nquestions, for a half-century the prime cause of sectional strife,\r\nhad been irrevocably settled, and passed to the domain of history.\r\nNew men had come to the front, and new questions were to be discussed\r\nand determined.\r\n\r\nTo the student of history, the years immediately preceding the\r\nCivil War are of abiding interest.  In some of its phases slavery was\r\nthe all-absorbing subject of debate throughout the entire country.\r\nIt had been the one recognized peril to the Union since the formation\r\nof the Government.  Beginning with the debates in the convention\r\nthat formulated the Federal Constitution, it remained for seventy\r\nyears the apple of discord,--the subject of patriotic apprehension\r\nand repeated compromise.  The last serious attempt to settle\r\nthis question in the manner just indicated was by the adjustment\r\nknown in our political history as \"the compromise measures of 1850.\"\r\nThese measures, although bitterly denounced in the South as well\r\nas in the North, received the sanction in national convention of\r\nboth of the great parties that two years later presented candidates\r\nfor the Presidency.  It is no doubt true that a majority of the\r\npeople, in both sections of the country, then believed that the\r\nquestion that had been so fraught with peril to national unity from\r\nthe beginning was at length settled for all time.  The rude\r\nawakening came two years later, when the country was aroused, as it\r\nhad rarely been before, by impassioned debate in and out of Congress,\r\nover the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.  It was a period of\r\nexcitement such as we shall probably not see again.  Slavery in\r\nall its phases was the one topic of earnest discussion, both upon the\r\nhustings and at the fireside.  There was little talk now of\r\ncompromise.  The old-time statesmen of the Clay and Webster, Winthrop\r\nand Crittenden, school soon disappeared from the arena.  Men hitherto\r\ncomparatively unknown to the country at large were soon to the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among them was a country lawyer whose home was at\r\nSpringfield, Illinois.  With the mighty events soon to follow, his\r\nname is imperishably linked.  But it is not of Lincoln the President,\r\nthe emancipator, the martyr, we are now to speak.  It is of Lincoln\r\nthe country lawyer, as he stepped upon the arena of high debate,\r\nthe unswerving antagonist of slavery extension half a century\r\nand more ago.\r\n\r\nHis home, during his entire professional life, was at the capital of\r\nthe State.  He was, at the time mentioned, in general practice as a\r\nlawyer and a regular attendant upon the neighboring courts.  His\r\nearly opportunities for education were meagre indeed.  He had been\r\na student of men, rather than of books.  He was, in the most\r\nexpressive sense, \"of the people,\"--the people as they then were.\r\nFor,\r\n\r\n  \"Know thou this, that men are as the time is.\"\r\n\r\nHis training was, in large measure, under the severe conditions to\r\nbe briefly mentioned.  The old-time custom of \"riding the circuit\"\r\nis to the present generation of lawyers only a tradition.  The few\r\nwho remember central Illinois as it was sixty years ago will readily\r\nrecall the full meaning of the expression.  The district in which Mr.\r\nLincoln practised extended from the counties of Livingston and\r\nWoodford upon the north, almost to the Indiana line--embracing the\r\npresent cities of Danville, Springfield, and Bloomington.  The last\r\nnamed was the home of the Hon. David Davis, the presiding judge of\r\nthe district.  As is well known, he was the intimate friend of Mr.\r\nLincoln, and the latter was often his guest during attendance upon\r\nthe courts at Bloomington.  At that early day, the term of court\r\nin few of the counties continued longer than a week, so that much of\r\nthe time of the judge and the lawyers who travelled the circuit\r\nwith him was spent upon horseback.  When it is remembered that there\r\nwere then no railroads, but few bridges, a sparse population,\r\nand that more than half the area embraced in that district was\r\nunbroken prairie, the real significance of riding the circuit will\r\nfully appear.  It was of this period that the late Governor\r\nFord, speaking of Judge Young,--whose district extended from Quincy,\r\nupon the Mississippi River to Chicago,--said:  \"He possesses in\r\nrare degree one of the highest requisites for a good circuit judge,\r\n--he is an excellent horseback rider.\"\r\n\r\nAt the period mentioned there were few law-books in the State.\r\nThe monster libraries of later days had not yet arrived.  The\r\nhalf-dozen volumes of State Reports, together with the Statutes\r\nand a few leading text-books, constituted the lawyer's library.\r\nTo an Illinois lawyer upon the circuit, a pair of saddle-bags was an\r\nindispensable part of his outfit.  With these, containing the\r\nfew books mentioned and a change or two of linen, and supplied with\r\nthe necessary horse, saddle and bridle, the lawyer of the pioneer days\r\nwas duly equipped for the active duties of his calling.  The lack\r\nof numerous volumes of adjudicated cases was, however, not an\r\nunmixed evil.  Causes were necessarily argued upon principle.  How\r\nwell this conduced to the making of the real lawyer is well known.\r\nThe admonition, \"Beware the man who reads but one book,\" is of deep\r\nsignificance.  The complaint to-day is not of scarcity, but that\r\n\"of the making of many books there is no end.\"  Professor Phelps\r\nis authority for the statement that \"it is easy to find single\r\nopinions in which more authorities are cited than were mentioned by\r\nMarshall in the whole thirty years of his unexampled judicial life;\r\nand briefs that contain more cases than Webster referred to in all\r\nthe arguments he ever delivered.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyers of the times whereof we write were, almost without\r\nexception, politicians--in close touch with the people, easy of\r\napproach, and obliging to the last degree.  Generally speaking,\r\na lawyer's office was as open to the public as the Courthouse\r\nitself.  That his surroundings were favorable to the cultivation\r\nof a high degree of sociability goes without saying.  Story-telling\r\nhelped often on the circuit to while away the long evenings at\r\ncountry taverns.  At times, perchance,\r\n\r\n  \"the night drave on wi' sangs and clatter.\"\r\n\r\nOratory counted for much more then than now.  When an important\r\ncase was on trial all other pursuits were for the time suspended, and\r\nthe people for miles around were in prompt attendance.  This was\r\nespecially the case when it was known that one or more of the\r\nleading advocates were to speak.  The litigation, too, was to a\r\nlarge extent different from that of to-day.  The country was\r\nnew, population sparse; the luxuries and many of the comforts of\r\nlife yet in the future; post-offices, schools, and churches many\r\nmiles away.  In every cabin were to be found the powder-horn,\r\nbullet-pouch, and rifle.  The restraints and amenities of modern\r\nsociety were in large measure unknown; and altogether much was to\r\nbe, and was, \"pardoned to the spirit of liberty.\"  There were no\r\ngreat corporations to be chosen defendants, but much of the time\r\nof the courts was taken up by suits in ejectment, actions for\r\nassault and battery, breach of promise, and slander.  One, not\r\ninfrequent, was replevin, involving the ownership of hogs, when by\r\nunquestioned usage all stock was permitted to run at large.  But\r\ncriminal trials of all grades, and in all their details, aroused\r\nthe deepest interest.  To these the people came from all directions,\r\nas if summoned to a general muster.  This was especially true if\r\na murder case was upon trial.  Excitement then ran high, and the\r\narguments of counsel, from beginning to close, were listened to\r\nwith breathless interest.  It will readily be seen that such\r\noccasions furnished rare opportunity to the gifted advocate.  In\r\nvery truth the general acquaintance thus formed, and the popularity\r\nachieved, have marked the beginning of more than one successful\r\nand brilliant political career.  Moreover, the thorough knowledge of\r\nthe people thus acquired by actual contact--the knowledge of their\r\ncondition, necessities, and wishes--resulted often in legislation of\r\nenduring benefit to the new country.  The Homestead law, the law\r\nsetting apart a moiety of the public domain for the maintenance of\r\nfree schools, and judicious provision for the establishment of the\r\nvarious charities, will readily be recalled.\r\n\r\nPolitics, in the modern sense--too often merely \"for what there is\r\nin it\"--was unknown.  As stepping-stones to local offices and even\r\nto Congress, the caucus and convention were yet to come.  Aspirants\r\nto public place presented their claims directly to the people, and\r\nthe personal popularity of the candidate was an important factor\r\nin achieving success.  Bribery at elections was rarely heard of.\r\nThe saying of the great bard,\r\n\r\n  \"If money go before,\r\n  All ways do open lie,\"\r\n\r\nawaited its verification in a later and more civilized period.  As\r\nlate even as 1858, when Lincoln and Douglas were rival aspirants\r\nto the Senate, when every voter in the State was a partisan of one\r\nor the other candidate, and the excitement was for many months\r\nintense, there was never, from either side, an intimation of the\r\ncorrupt use of a farthing to influence the result.\r\n\r\nNo period of our history has witnessed more intense devotion to\r\ngreat party leaders than that of which we write.  Of eminent\r\nstatesmen, whose names were still invoked, none had filled larger space\r\nthan did Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson.  The former was the\r\nearly political idol of Mr. Lincoln; the latter, of Mr. Douglas.\r\nPossibly, since the foundation of the Government, no statesman has\r\nbeen so completely idolized by his friends and party as was\r\nHenry Clay.  Words are meaningless when the attempt is made to\r\nexpress the idolatry of the Whigs of his own State for their great\r\nchieftain.  For a lifetime he knew no rival.  His wish was law\r\nto his followers.  In the realm of party leadership a greater than\r\nhe hath not appeared.  At his last defeat for the Presidency strong\r\nmen wept bitter tears.  When his star set, it was felt to be the\r\nsignal for the dissolution of the great party of which he was\r\nthe founder.  In words worthy to be recalled, \"when the tidings\r\ncame like wailing over the State that Harry Percy's spur was cold,\r\nthe chivalrous felt somehow the world had grown commonplace.\"\r\n\r\nThe following incident, along the line indicated, may be considered\r\ncharacteristic.  While Mr. Clay was a Senator, a resolution, in\r\naccordance with a sometime custom, was introduced into the Kentucky\r\nHouse of Representatives instructing the Senators from that State to\r\nvote in favor of a certain bill then pending in Congress.  The\r\nresolution was in the act of passing without opposition, when a\r\nhitherto silent member from one of the mountain counties, springing\r\nto his feet, exclaimed:  \"Mr. Speaker, am I to understand that this\r\nLegislature is undertaking _to tell_ Henry Clay how to vote?\"  The\r\nSpeaker answered that such was the purport of the resolution.\r\nAt which the member from the mountains, throwing up his arms,\r\nexclaimed \"Great God!\" and sank into his seat.  It is needless\r\nto add that the resolution was immediately rejected by unanimous\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of a century ago the Hon. John P. Kennedy wrote of\r\nthe lawyers of his day:\r\n\r\n\"The feelings, habits, and associations of the bar in general, have\r\na very happy influence upon the character.  And, take it altogether,\r\nthere may be collected from it a greater mass of shrewd, observant,\r\ndroll, playful, and generous spirits, than from any other equal\r\nnumbers of society.  They live in each other's presence like a set\r\nof players; congregate in courts like the former in the green room;\r\nand break their unpremeditated jests, in the intervals of business,\r\nwith that sort of undress freedom that contrasts amusingly with\r\nthe solemn and even tragic seriousness with which they appear in\r\nturn upon the boards.  They have one face for the public, rife with\r\nthe saws and learned gravity of the profession, and another for\r\nthemselves, replete with broad mirth, sprightly wit, and gay\r\nthoughtlessness.  The intense mental toil and fatigue of\r\nbusiness give them a peculiar relish for the enjoyment of their\r\nhours of relaxation, and, in the same degree, incapacitate them\r\nfor that frugal attention to their private concerns which their\r\nlimited means usually require.  They have, in consequence, a\r\nprevailing air of unthriftiness in personal matters, which, however\r\nit may operate to the prejudice of the pocket of the individual, has\r\na mellow and kindly effect upon his disposition.  In an old member\r\nof the profession, one who has grown gray in the service, there is\r\na rich unction of originality that brings him out from the ranks\r\nof his fellowmen in strong relief.  His habitual conversancy with the\r\nworld in its strangest varieties and with the secret history of\r\ncharacter, gives him a shrewd estimate of the human heart.  He\r\nis quiet, and unapt to be struck with wonder at any of the actions\r\nof men.  There is a deep current of observation running calmly\r\nthrough his thoughts, and seldom gushing out in words; the confidence\r\nwhich has been placed in him, in the thousand relations of his\r\nprofession, renders him constitutionally cautious.  His acquaintance\r\nwith the vicissitudes of fortune, as they have been exemplified in\r\nthe lives of individuals, and with the severe afflictions that have\r\n'tried the reins' of many, known only to himself, makes him an\r\nindulgent and charitable apologist of the aberrations of others.\r\nHe has an impregnable good humor that never falls below the level of\r\nthoughtfulness into melancholy.\"\r\n\r\nA distinguished writer, two generations ago, said of the early\r\nWestern bar:\r\n\r\n\"Not only was it a body distinguished for dignity and tolerance,\r\nbut chivalrous courage was a marked characteristic.  Personal\r\ncowardice was odious among the bar, as among the hunters who had\r\nfought the British and the Indians.  Hence, insulting language,\r\nand the use of billingsgate, were too hazardous to be indulged\r\nwhere a personal accounting was a strong possibility.  Not only\r\ndid common prudence dictate courtesy among the members of the bar,\r\nbut an exalted spirit of honor and well-bred politeness prevailed.\r\nThe word of a counsel to his adversary was his inviolable bond.\r\nThe suggestion of a lawyer as to the existence of a fact was accepted\r\nas verity by the court.  To insinuate unprofessional conduct was\r\nto impute infamy.\"\r\n\r\nI distinctly recall the first time I saw Mr. Lincoln.  In September,\r\n1852, two lawyers from Springfield, somewhat travel-stained with\r\ntheir sixty miles' journey, alighted from the stage-coach in front\r\nof the old tavern in Bloomington.  The taller and younger of the\r\ntwo was Abraham Lincoln; the other, his personal friend and former\r\npreceptor, John T. Stuart.  That evening it was my good fortune to\r\nhear Mr. Lincoln address a political meeting at the old Courthouse\r\nin advocacy of the election of General Winfield Scott to the\r\nPresidency.  The speech was one of great ability, and but little\r\nthat was favorable of the military record of General Pierce remained\r\nwhen the speech was concluded.  The Mexican War was then of recent\r\noccurrence, its startling events fresh in the memory of all, and\r\nits heroes still the heroes of the hour.  The more than half-century\r\nthat has passed has not wholly dispelled my recollection of Mr.\r\nLincoln's eloquent tribute to \"the hero of Lundy's Lane,\" and his\r\nhumorous description of the military career of General Franklin Pierce.\r\n\r\nThe incident now to be related occurred at the old National Hotel in\r\nBloomington in September, 1854.  Senator Douglas had been advertised\r\nto speak, and a large audience was in attendance.  It was his first\r\nappearance there since the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill.\r\nThe writer, then a student at the Wesleyan University, with his\r\nclassmate James S. Ewing and many others, had called upon Mr.\r\nDouglas at his hotel.  While there the Hon. Jesse W. Fell, a\r\nprominent citizen of Bloomington and the close friend of Mr.\r\nLincoln, also called upon Mr. Douglas, and after some conversation\r\nwith him said in substance, that inasmuch as there was profound\r\ninterest felt in the great question then pending, and the people\r\nwere anxious to hear both sides, he thought it would be well to\r\nhave a joint discussion between Judge Douglas and Mr. Lincoln.  To\r\nwhich proposition Mr. Douglas at once demanded, \"What party does\r\nMr. Lincoln represent?\"  The answer of Mr. Fell was, \"the Whig\r\nparty, of course.\"  Declining the proposition with much feeling Mr.\r\nDouglas said, \"When I came home from Washington I was assailed\r\nin the northern part of the State by an old line abolitionist,\r\nin the central part of the State by a Whig, and in Southern Illinois\r\nby an anti-Nebraska Democrat.  I cannot hold the Whig responsible for\r\nwhat the abolitionist says, nor the anti-Nebraska Democrat responsible\r\nfor what either of the others say, and it looks like dogging a man\r\nall over the State.\"  There was no further allusion to the subject,\r\nand Mr. Lincoln soon after called.  The greeting between Judge\r\nDouglas and himself was most cordial, and their conversation,\r\nprincipally of incidents of their early lives, of the most agreeable\r\nand friendly character.  Judge Lawrence Weldon, just then at the\r\nbeginning of an honorable career, was present at the above interview,\r\nand has in a sketch of Mr. Lincoln given its incidents more in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nCourts of justice, and the law as a distinctive calling, are the\r\nnecessary outgrowths of civilization.  In his rude state, man\r\navenged his wrongs with his own strong arm, and the dogma, \"Might makes\r\nright,\" passed unchallenged.  But as communities assumed organic\r\nform, tribunals were instituted for the administration of justice and\r\nthe maintenance of public order.  The progress of society, from\r\na condition of semi-barbarism and ignorance to a state of the\r\nhighest culture and refinement, may be traced by its advancement\r\nin the modes of administering justice, and in the character and\r\nlearning of its tribunals.  The advance steps taken from time to\r\ntime in the history of jurisprudence are the milestones which stand\r\nout on the highway of civilization.  All along the pathway of human\r\nprogress, the courts of justice have been the sure criteria by\r\nwhich to judge of the intelligence and virtue of our race.\r\n\r\nTruly it has been said:  \"With the coming of the lawyer came a new\r\npower in the world.  The steel-clad baron and his retainers were\r\nawed by terms they had never before heard and did not understand, such\r\nas precedent, principle, and the like.  The great and real pacifier\r\nof the world was the lawyer.  His parchment took the place of\r\nthe battle-field.  The flow of his ink checked the flow of blood.\r\nHis quill usurped the place of the sword.  His legalism dethroned\r\nbarbarism.  His victories were victories of peace.  He impressed\r\non individuals and on communities that which he is now endeavoring\r\nto impress on nations, that there are many controversies that it\r\nwere better to lose by arbitration than to win by war and\r\nbloodshed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is all-important, never more so than now, that the people should\r\nmagnify the law.  Whatever lessens respect for its authority bodes\r\nevil and only evil to the State.  No occasion could arise more\r\nappropriate than this in which to utter solemn words of warning\r\nagainst an evil of greater menace to the public weal than aught to\r\nbe apprehended from foreign foe.  In many localities a spirit of\r\nlawlessness has asserted itself in its most hideous form.  The rule\r\nof the mob has at times usurped that of the law.  Outrages have\r\nbeen perpetrated in the name of summary justice, appalling to\r\nall thoughtful men.  It need hardly be said that all this is in\r\ntotal disregard of individual rights, and utterly subversive of\r\nall lawful authority.\r\n\r\nBy the solemn adjudication of courts, and under the safeguards\r\nof law, the fact of guilt is to be established, and the guilty\r\npunished.  The spirit of the mob is in deadly antagonism to all\r\nconstituted authority.  Unless curbed it will sap the foundation\r\nof civilized society.  Lynching a human creature is no less murder\r\nwhen the act of a mob than when that of a single individual.  There\r\nis no safety to society but in an aroused public sentiment that\r\nwill hold each participant amenable to the law for the consequences\r\nof the crime he either perpetrates or abets.  This is the land\r\nof liberty, \"of the largest liberty,\" but let it never be forgotten\r\nthat it is liberty regulated by law.  Let him be accounted a public\r\nenemy who would weaken the bonds of human society, and destroy what\r\nit has cost our race the sacrifice and toil of centuries to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe sure rock of defence in the outstretched years as in the\r\nlong past, will be the intelligence, the patriotism, the virtue of\r\na law-abiding, liberty-loving people.  To a degree that cannot\r\nbe measured by words, the temple of justice will prove the city of\r\nrefuge.  \"The judiciary has no guards, no palaces, no treasuries; no\r\narms but truth and wisdom; and no splendor but justice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nNOTABLE MEMBERS OF THE FORTY-FOURTH CONGRESS--TRIAL OF GENERAL\r\nBELKNAP--THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST BETWEEN HAYES AND TILDEN--CREATION\r\nOF THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION--THE WRITER'S SPEECH ON THAT OCCASION--\r\nPROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE DURING THIS CONGRESS--ANECDOTES\r\nOF MR.

Among its members were many gentlemen\r\nof distinction, some of whom had known active service in the field.\r\nPolitical disabilities had been in large measure removed, and\r\nthe South was now, for the first time since the war, represented in\r\nCongress by its old-time statesmen.  Of this number may be mentioned\r\nMr. Stephens of Georgia, Mr. Lamar of Mississippi, and Mr. Reagan of\r\nTexas.  From the membership of this House were afterwards chosen\r\ntwenty-six Senators, ten members of the Cabinet, one Justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and from this and the House immediately succeeding,\r\nthree Vice-Presidents and two Presidents of the United States.  The\r\nproceedings of this Congress marked an important epoch in our\r\nhistory.  During its first session occurred the masterful debate\r\nupon the General Amnesty Bill.  The very depths of partisan feeling\r\nwere stirred, and for many days it was indeed a titanic struggle.\r\nThe speeches attracting the greatest attention were those of Blaine\r\nand Garfield upon the one side, and Hill of Georgia and Lamar upon\r\nthe other.  This great debate recalled vividly that of Webster and\r\nHayne, in the other wing of the Capitol, almost half a century before.\r\n\r\nThis session also witnessed the impeachment of a Cabinet officer, General\r\nBelknap, Secretary of War.  The trial occurred before the\r\nSenate, sitting as a court of impeachment during the closing weeks\r\nof the session, and resulted in his acquittal, less than two-thirds\r\nof the Senators voting for conviction.  General Belknap was\r\nrepresented by an able array of counsel, chief of whom were\r\nJudge Black of Pennsylvania and the Hon. Matthew H. Carpenter\r\nof Wisconsin.  Mr. Knott of Kentucky, Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts,\r\nand Mr. Lord of New York, conducted the prosecution in the main as\r\nmanagers on the part of the House of Representatives.  The principal\r\ncontention on the part of the counsel for the accused was that there\r\ncould be no conviction, inasmuch as Belknap had resigned his office\r\nbefore the article of impeachment had been preferred.  This view\r\nseems to have been decisive of the final vote of many Senators,\r\nand the accused stood acquitted at the bar of the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen the second session of this Congress convened, in December,\r\n1876, the excitement throughout the country was intense over the\r\npending Presidential contest between Hayes and Tilden.  As will be\r\nremembered, the electoral vote of two States, Louisiana and Florida,\r\nwas claimed by each of the candidates.  These votes were decisive of\r\nthe result.  As the days passed and the time approached for the\r\njoint session of the Senate and the House, for the purpose of\r\ncounting the electoral votes and declaring the result, the tension\r\nbecame greater, and partisan feeling more intense.  The friends of\r\nHayes were in the majority in the Senate; those of Tilden, in\r\nthe House.  With conflicting certificates, both purporting to give\r\nthe correct vote from each of the States named, and no lawful\r\nauthority existing to determine as to their validity, it can readily\r\nbe seen that the situation was one to arouse the grave apprehension\r\nof all thoughtful men.  The condition was without a precedent in\r\nour history.  Twice had there been a failure to elect a President by\r\nthe people, and by constitutional provision the election in each\r\ninstance devolved upon the House.  In the first-mentioned case, in\r\n1801, Mr. Jefferson was chosen; and in the latter, in 1825, Mr.\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.  In neither of the cases just mentioned had\r\nthere been a question as to _how_ any State had voted.  It was\r\nsimply that no person had received a majority of all of the electoral\r\nvotes cast.  The method of settlement was clearly pointed out by\r\nthe Constitution.  As already indicated, the case was wholly\r\ndifferent in the Hayes-Tilden controversy.  The question then was as\r\nto _how_ certain States had voted.  It was for the purpose of\r\nascertaining this fact and certifying the same to the joint session\r\nof the Senate and House, that the Electoral Commission was constituted.\r\nThe bill having this end in view originated in the House in January,\r\n1877; the Commission was constituted, and the controverted questions\r\nwere soon thereafter determined.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission was an imperative necessity.  As such\r\nit was created,--consisting of five members each from the Senate, the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and the Supreme Court.  Its decisions\r\nwere adverse to Mr. Tilden from the beginning, and resulted in the\r\nfinding that all disputed votes should be counted for his opponent.\r\nThis, it will be remembered, gave Hayes a majority of one on the\r\nfinal count, and resulted in his induction into office.  Partisan feeling\r\nwas at its height, and the question of the justice of the decision\r\nof the Electoral Commission was vehemently discussed.\r\n\r\nTo the end that there might be a peaceful determination of the\r\nperilous question, that of disputed succession to the Presidency, I\r\nwas an earnest advocate of the bill creating the Commission.  Upon\r\nthe question of concurrence by the House of Representatives in the\r\nfinal determination of the Commission, bitter opposition was\r\nmanifested upon the part of friends of Mr. Tilden, and a heated\r\npartisan debate resulted, and during this debate I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When this Congress assembled in December, it witnessed the American\r\npeople from one end of the country to the other divided upon the\r\nquestion as to which candidate had been lawfully elected to the\r\nhigh office of President of the United States.  The business\r\nindustries of the country were paralyzed, public confidence destroyed,\r\nand the danger of civil war was imminent.  That Mr. Tilden had\r\nreceived a majority of more than two hundred thousand of the popular\r\nvote was not disputed.  That he had secured a majority of the\r\nPresidential electors in the several States, and was lawfully\r\nentitled to be inducted into the great office, was the firm belief\r\nof fully one-half of the people of this country.  The hour was one\r\nof great peril to our institutions, and many were apprehensive that\r\nwe were but entering into the dark night of anarchy and confusion.\r\nAfter many weeks of angry discussion, which resulted in still\r\nfurther arousing the passions of the people, a measure of adjustment\r\nwas proposed.  It was believed that there was still patriotism\r\nenough left in the American Congress to secure an honorable and fair\r\nsettlement of this most dangerous question.  We all recall how our\r\nhopes revived, and how gladly we hailed the introduction of the\r\nbill recommended by a joint committee of conference of the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives.  It was welcomed as the harbinger of\r\npeace by the entire people of our country.\r\n\r\n\"I gave that bill my earnest support.  It had in the House no friend\r\nmore ardent in its advocacy than myself.  I believed it to be a\r\nmeasure in the interest of peace.  I believed that those who framed\r\nit, as well as those who gave it their support upon the floor, were\r\nhonest in their statements, that no man could afford to take the\r\nPresidency with a clouded title, and that the object of the bill was\r\nto ascertain which of the candidates was lawfully entitled to\r\nthe electoral votes of Florida and Louisiana.  I never mistrusted for\r\na moment that statesmen of high repute could in so perilous an\r\nhour, upon so grave a question, palter with words in a double sense.\r\n\r\n\"We who are the actors in this drama know, and history will record\r\nthe fact, that the Conference Bill became a law, and the Electoral\r\nCommission was organized, not for the purpose of ascertaining which\r\ncandidate had _prima facie_ a majority of the electoral votes; not\r\nfor the purpose of ascertaining that the Governor of Florida,\r\nand the _de facto_ Governor of Louisiana, had given certificates\r\nto the Hayes electors.  It was never dreamed that a tribunal,\r\nconsisting in part of five judges of the highest court on earth,\r\nwas to be constituted, whose sole duty was to report a fact known to\r\nevery man in the land, that the returning-board of Louisiana had\r\ngiven the votes of that State to the Hayes electors.  The avowed\r\nobject of that bill was to ascertain which candidate had received a\r\nmajority of the legal votes of those States.  The avowed object of\r\nthe bill was the secure the ends of justice; to see that the will of\r\nthe people was executed; that the Republic suffered no harm; to\r\nsee that the title to this great office was not tainted with fraud.\r\nHow well the members of this tribunal have discharged the sacred\r\ntrust committed to them, let them answer to history.\r\n\r\n\"The record will stand that this tribunal shut its eyes to the\r\nlight of truth; refused to hear the undisputed proof that a majority\r\nof seven thousand legal votes in the State of Louisiana for Tilden\r\nwas by a fraudulent returning-board changed to eight thousand\r\nmajority for Hayes.  The Republican Representative from Florida,\r\nMr. Purman, has solemnly declared upon this floor that Florida had\r\ngiven its vote to Tilden.  I am not surprised that two distinguished\r\nRepublican Representatives from Massachusetts, Mr. Seelye and Mr.\r\nPierce, have in such thrilling tones expressed their dissent from the\r\njudgment of this tribunal.  By this decision fraud has become one of\r\nthe legalized modes of securing the vote of a State.  Can it be\r\npossible that the American people are prepared to accept the doctrine\r\nthat fraud, which vitiates all contracts and agreements, which\r\ntaints the judgments and decrees of courts, which will even annul the\r\nsolemn covenant of marriage--fraud, which poisons wherever it enters\r\n--can be inquired into in all the relations of human life save only\r\nwhere a returning-board is its instrument, and the dearest rights of\r\na sovereign people are at stake?\r\n\r\n\"But we are told that we created this tribunal and must abide by\r\nits arbitrament.  I propose to do so in good faith.  I have, from the\r\nbeginning, opposed every movement that looked only to delay.  I\r\nhave voted against all dilatory motions.  But the decision of this\r\ntribunal is too startling and too far-reaching in its consequences\r\nto pass unchallenged.  That the returning-board of Louisiana\r\nwill find no imitators in our future history is more than I dare\r\nhope.  The pernicious doctrine that fraud and perjury are to be\r\nrecognized auxiliaries in popular elections is one that may return\r\nto plague its inventors.  The worst effect of this decision will\r\nbe its lesson to the young men of our country.  Hereafter old-fashioned\r\nhonesty is at a discount, and villainy and fraud the legalized\r\ninstruments of success.  The fact may be conceded, the proof\r\noverwhelming, that the honest voice of a State has been overthrown\r\nby outrage and fraud, and yet the chosen tribunal of the people\r\nhas entered of solemn record that there is no remedy.\r\n\r\n  'O Judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts!'\r\n\r\n\"My criticism of the decision of this tribunal rests upon its\r\nfinding in the cases of Louisiana and Florida; upon the Oregon case\r\nI have no criticism to offer.  It is true that but two votes of\r\nthat State could have been given to Hayes had the decision first\r\nadopted by the Commission been followed in the case of Oregon.\r\nHowever inconsistent it may be with other rulings of the Commission,\r\nstanding alone it is in the main correct.  The sanctity of seal of\r\nState and certificate of Governor applied only to Louisiana and\r\nFlorida; the Governor of Oregon was not of the household of the\r\nfaithful.\r\n\r\n\"The people of Oregon cast a majority of their votes for Hayes,\r\nand no vote or act of mine shall stand in the way of its being\r\nso recorded.  Such have been my convictions from the beginning,\r\nand the great wrong done in Louisiana and Florida cannot warp my\r\nconvictions at this hour.\r\n\r\n\"We have now reached the final act in this great drama, and the\r\nrecord here made will pass into history.  Time, the great healer, will\r\nbring a balm to those who feel sick at heart because of this grievous\r\nwrong.  But who can estimate, what seer can foretell, the evils\r\nthat may result to us and our children from this judgment?  Fortunate,\r\nindeed, will it be for this country if our people lose not faith\r\nin popular institutions; fortunate, indeed, if they abate not their\r\nconfidence in the integrity of that high tribunal, for a century the\r\nbulwark of our liberties.  In all times of popular commotion and\r\nperil, the Supreme Court of the United States has been looked to\r\nas the final arbiter, its decrees heeded as the voice of God.  How\r\ndisastrous may be the result of decisions so manifestly partisan, I\r\nwill not attempt to forecast.\r\n\r\n\"Let this vote be now taken and the curtain fall upon these scenes\r\nforever.  To those who believe, as I do, that a grievous wrong has\r\nbeen suffered, let me entreat that this arbitrament be abided in\r\ngood faith, that no hindrance or delay be interposed to the execution\r\nof the law, but that by faithful adherence to its mandates, by\r\nhonest efforts to revive the prostrate industries of the country, by\r\nobedience to the constituted authorities, we will show ourselves\r\npatriots rather than partisans in the hour of our country's\r\nmisfortune.\"\r\n\r\nSome mention will now be made of prominent members of the House\r\nduring this Congress.  The Hon. Michael C. Kerr of Indiana was\r\nelected Speaker of the House.  The vote of the Republican minority\r\nwas given to the Hon. James G. Blaine, who had been Speaker during\r\nthe three Congresses immediately preceding.  Mr. Kerr was a gentleman\r\nof high character and recognized ability.  He had been for many\r\nyears a member of the House, and was familiar with the details\r\nof its business.  He was in failing health at the time of his\r\nelection, and died before the close of the first session of that\r\nCongress.  He was physically unable to preside during the greater part\r\nof the session, and was frequently relieved from the onerous duties\r\nof the Chair by two new members who were yet to achieve distinction\r\nin that body, Mr. Blackburn of Kentucky and Mr. Springer of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine, the leader of the minority, had been for twelve years a\r\nmember of the House, having been first elected at the age of\r\nthirty-three.  He was a brilliant debater, well versed in parliamentary\r\nlaw, and at all points fully equipped for the conflict.  With the\r\nexception of Henry Clay, the House of Representatives has probably\r\nnever known his equal as a party leader.  That he possessed a touch\r\nof humor will appear from the following.  While the discussion was\r\nat its height upon his amendment excluding Jefferson Davis\r\nfrom the benefit of the General Amnesty Bill, Mr. Blaine,\r\nlooking across to the opposite side of the Chamber, said:\r\n\"I confess to a feeling of commiseration for some gentlemen\r\nupon the other side, who represent close districts.  Surrounded by\r\ntheir Southern associates here, and with intense Union constituencies\r\nat home, their apprehension, as they are called to vote upon\r\nthis amendment, is indeed deplorable.  It remind me of a Hibernian\r\nprocession I once saw moving down Broadway, where the serious\r\nquestion was how to keep step to the music, and at the same time\r\nto dodge the omnibuses!\"\r\n\r\nMy seat was just across the aisle from that of Mr. Blaine.  When\r\nintroduced, I handed him letters of introduction from two of his\r\ncollege classmates, the Hon. Robert E. Williams and the Rev. John Y.\r\nCalhoun.  After reading the letters and speaking most kindly of\r\nhis old Washington College classmates, he brusquely inquired, \"What\r\nare John Y. Calhoun's politics?\"\r\n\r\nI answered, \"He is a Democrat.\"\r\n\r\nBlaine instantly replied, \"Well, how strangely things do come around\r\nin this world!  When we were in college together, Calhoun was\r\nthe strongest kind of Presbyterian.\"\r\n\r\nI intimated that his sometime classmate was still of that eminently\r\nrespectable persuasion.  The reply was, in manner indicating apparent\r\nsurprise, \"Is it possible that out in your country a man can be\r\na Presbyterian and a Democrat at the same time?\"\r\n\r\nI was a member of the Board of Visitors to West Point in June,\r\n1877.  Mr. Blaine and Bishop Quintard of Tennessee were also members.\r\nGeneral Hancock was with our Board for some days at the little West\r\nPoint Inn, and delivered the address to the graduating class of\r\ncadets.  He was then in excellent health, and as superb in appearance\r\nas he had been courageous in battle.  I have never heard more\r\nbrilliant conversation than that at our table, in which the chief\r\nparticipants were Gail Hamilton, Bishop Quintard, General Hancock,\r\nSenator Maxey, and Mr. Blaine.  The last named, \"upon the plain\r\nhighway of talk,\" was unrivalled.\r\n\r\nWhile the Board was in session, Mr. Blaine and I spent some hours with\r\nthe Hon. Hamilton Fish, late Secretary of State, at his country\r\nhome near West Point.  Near by was still standing the historic\r\nBeverly Robinson House, the home of Benedict Arnold when he was in\r\ncommand of the Colonial forces at West Point.  As we passed through\r\nthe quaint old mansion, Mr. Blaine, whose knowledge of our\r\nRevolutionary history was all-embracing, described graphically the\r\nconditions existing at the time of Arnold's treason, and just where\r\neach person sat at the breakfast table in the old dining-room in\r\nwhich we were then standing, on the fateful morning when the courier\r\nfrom the British camp hurriedly announced to General Arnold the\r\ncapture of Major Andre.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine and I were once passing along Pennsylvania Avenue, a\r\nthird of a century ago, when he remarked that the old building just\r\nto our right had once been a high-toned gambling house; that there\r\nwere traditions to the effect that some well-known statesmen were not\r\nwholly unadvised as to its exact location and uses.  He then told me\r\nthat during his first term in Congress he was early one morning\r\npassing this building on his way to the Capitol.  Just as he reached\r\nthe spot where we were then standing, the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens\r\ncame down the steps of the building mentioned, and, immediately\r\nafter his cordial greeting to Mr. Blaine, was accosted by a\r\nnegro preacher, who earnestly requested a contribution toward\r\nthe building of a church for his people.  Promptly taking a roll\r\nfrom his vest pocket, Mr. Stevens handed the negro a fifty-dollar bill,\r\nand turning to Blaine solemnly observed,\r\n\r\n  \"God moves in a mysterious way\r\n  His wonders to perform!\"\r\n\r\nAt the time first mentioned, Mr. Blaine was in excellent health,\r\nbuoyant in spirits, aggressive to the last degree, and full of hope\r\nas to the future.  The disappointments and bereavements that saddened\r\nthe closing years of his life had as yet cast no shadow upon his\r\npathway.\r\n\r\nNext in leadership to Mr. Blaine, upon the Republican side, was\r\nthe Hon. James A. Garfield.  He possessed few of the qualities\r\nof brilliant leadership so eminently characteristic of Blaine, but\r\nwas withal one of the ablest men I have ever known.  Gifted with\r\nrare powers of oratory, with an apparently inexhaustible reservoir\r\nof information at his command, he knew no superior in debate.\r\nAt one period of his life he was the recipient of public honors\r\nwithout a parallel in our history.  While yet a Representative in\r\nCongress, he was a Senator-elect from Ohio, and the President-elect\r\nof the United States.  For once, it indeed seemed that \"fortune\r\nhad come with both hands full.\"  In the words of the Persian poet,\r\n\"he had obtained an ear of corn from every harvest.\"  And yet, a\r\nfew months later, in the words of his great eulogist, \"the stately\r\nmansion of power had become to him the wearisome hospital of pain,\r\nand he begged to be taken from its prison walls, from its oppressive,\r\nstifling air, from its homelessness and its hopelessness.\"\r\n\r\nMy personal acquaintance with Mr. Garfield began early in January,\r\n1876, when we were members of the House Committee appointed by the\r\nSpeaker to convey the remains of a deceased member to his late\r\nhome, Norwich, Connecticut, for burial.  Another member of the\r\nCommittee was Representative Wheeler of New York.  It was late\r\nSaturday afternoon when we were conveyed by carriages from the\r\ncrossing at Jersey City to the depot where the Norwich train was\r\nin waiting.  Our route lay for some distance along Broadway, through\r\nthe very heart of the great metropolis.  As we passed the hurrying\r\nthrongs that crowded the great thoroughfare that sombre winter\r\nevening, Mr. Garfield remarked that it was a scene similar to\r\nthe one we were then witnessing that suggested to Mr. Bryant one\r\nof the most stirring of his shorter poems.\r\n\r\nAt our request and in tones that linger even yet in my memory,\r\nhe then repeated these lines:\r\n\r\n  \"Let me move slowly through the street\r\n  Filled with an ever shifting train,\r\n  Amid the sound of steps that beat\r\n  The murmuring walks like autumn rain.\r\n\r\n  How fast the flitting figures come,\r\n  The mild, the fierce, the stony face;\r\n  Some bright with thoughtless smiles, and some\r\n  Where secret tears have left their trace!\r\n\r\n  They pass to toil, to strife, to rest,\r\n  To halls in which the feast is spread,\r\n  To chambers where the funeral guest\r\n  In silence sits beside the dead.\r\n\r\n  Each where his tasks or pleasures call\r\n  They pass, and heed each other not.\r\n  There is Who heeds, Who holds them all\r\n  In His large love, and boundless thought.\r\n\r\n  These struggling tides of life that seem\r\n  In wayward, aimless course to tend,\r\n  Are eddies of the mighty stream\r\n  That rolls to its appointed end.\"\r\n\r\nNorwich, the home of the deceased member, Mr. Starkweather, and\r\nwhere he was laid to rest, is a beautiful city and one of much\r\nhistoric interest.  It was here that Benedict Arnold was born, and\r\nthe ruins of his early home were still to be seen.  Of greater\r\ninterest was a monument standing in an old Indian burying-ground\r\nnear the centre of the city,--\"Erected to the Memory of Uncas.\"\r\nIt was within the memory of the oldest inhabitant that the President\r\nof the United States and his Cabinet were in attendance at the\r\ndedication of this monument, and deeply interested in the impressive\r\nceremonies in honor of \"the last of the Mohicans.\"\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly courteous gentleman upon the same side of the chamber\r\nwas the Hon. Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts.  He had been a\r\nMajor-general during the late war and was an ex-Governor of his\r\nState.  He first achieved national distinction in the thirty-fourth\r\nCongress, when after a protracted and exciting struggle, he was elected\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives.  In the body over which he had so\r\nably presided in ante-bellum days, he had again taken his seat.\r\nWhile by no means taking the highest rank as a debater, he was\r\nfamiliar with the complicated rules governing the House, and his\r\nopinion challenged the highest respect.  He and Mr. Blaine were\r\nthe only members of that House who had previously held the position\r\nof Speaker.\r\n\r\nNear General Banks sat the Hon. William D. Kelley of Pennsylvania.\r\nHe had known many years of legislative service, and was long\r\n\"the father of the House.\"  One of the features of its successive\r\norganization, as many old members will recall, was the administration\r\nof the official oath to the Speaker-elect by the member who had known\r\nthe longest continuous service--\"the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\"\r\nWhen in the fulness of times he passed to \"the house not made with\r\nhands,\" his mantle fell upon Judge Holman of Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe House probably contained no member of rarer attainments in\r\nscholarship than Julius H. Seelye of Massachusetts.  He stood in\r\nthe front ranks of the great educators of his day, and was President\r\nof Amherst College during the latter years of his life.  His\r\npolitical service was limited to one term in Congress.  His speech\r\nnear its beginning upon the General Amnesty Bill challenged the\r\nprofound attention of the House, and at once gave him honored place\r\nin its membership.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional career of the Hon. George W. McCrary, of Iowa,\r\nterminated with this Congress.  He was recognized as one of the\r\nablest lawyers of the House, and was one of its most agreeable and\r\ncourteous members.  During the presidency of Hayes he held the\r\nposition of Secretary of War, and was later a Judge of the\r\nUnited States Circuit Court.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois, the present Speaker, was\r\njust at the beginning of his long Congressional career.  For\r\nmany years he has been an active leader of the House and a prominent\r\nparticipant in its important debates.  His characteristic patience\r\nand long-suffering courtesy have no doubt at times been sorely\r\ntried by attempts to enlarge the sum total of appropriation\r\nbills reported by the Committee of which he was chairman.  To\r\nthe important post of \"watch-dog of the Treasury,\" he was, _nem.\r\ncon.,_ the successor to the lamented Holman.  In this connection\r\na suggestive incident is recalled.  One of the guides of the Capitol,\r\nwhen some years ago showing a visitor through the Vice-President's\r\nchamber, called attention to a little old-fashioned mirror upon\r\nits walls.  The guide explained that this mirror was purchased at a\r\ncost of thirty dollars when John Adams was Vice-President, but when\r\nthe bill for its payment was before the House, Mr. Holman objected.\r\nA Western member, who had just been defeated upon a proposed\r\namendment to an appropriation bill, by reason of a fatal point\r\nof order raised by the chairman, promptly exclaimed, \"I move to\r\nstrike out Holman and insert Cannon.\"\r\n\r\nThe sagacity and untiring industry of Mr. Cannon have elevated him\r\nto the Speakership, and possibly yet higher honors await him.\r\nIt is a significant fact in this connection, however, that\r\nnotwithstanding the brilliant array of ambitious statesmen who have\r\nheld the Speakership for more than a century, only one, Mr. Polk, has\r\never reached the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThe forty-fourth Congress was the last of which the Hon. William A.\r\nWheeler of New York was a member.  He was elected Vice-president\r\nin 1876, and the duties of that office have rarely been discharged\r\nby an abler or more courteous officer.  He was highly esteemed\r\nby his associates during his long service in the House.  His\r\nprinciple in action seemed ever to be, \"there is nothing so kingly\r\nas kindness.\"\r\n\r\nMessrs. Hale and Frye of Maine, Aldrich of Rhode Island, Money\r\nof Mississippi, Taylor of Tennessee, and Elkins of West Virginia, were\r\nmembers of this House; all of whom are now Senators of marked\r\nability, and well known to the entire country.\r\n\r\nA member of this House, who at a later date, and in the other wing\r\nof the Capitol, achieved yet greater distinction, was the Hon.\r\nGeorge F. Hoar of Massachusetts.  At the close of this Congress he\r\nwas transferred to the Senate, where for more than a quarter of\r\na century he was a prominent leader.  His ability and attainments were\r\nof the highest, and he was the worthy successor of Webster in\r\nthe great body of which he was so long an honored member.\r\n\r\nIn addition to more solid qualities, Mr. Hoar was gifted with a\r\nkeen sense of humor, as will appear from one or two incidents to\r\nbe mentioned.  In the House, Mr. Springer, in order to prevent the\r\nreconsideration of resolutions and debate thereupon under the rules,\r\nhad frequently cut off the possibility of such debate by the timely\r\ninterposition of the words, \"Not to be brought back on a motion to\r\nreconsider.\"  Now, it so fell out that upon a certain day Mr.\r\nSpringer received a telegram calling him home just as the roll-call\r\nwas ordered upon an important bill.  Earnestly desiring to vote--\r\nwhich owing to the early departure of his train was impossible\r\nif he waited until his name was regularly reached upon the roll\r\n--he moved to the front of the Speaker, and after brief explanation,\r\nasked unanimous consent to vote at once.  Permission was of course\r\ngranted, his name at once called, and his vote given.  Grateful\r\nfor the courtesy, he bowed repeatedly to each side of the Chamber,\r\nand, hurrying up the aisle, was about to take his exit, when Mr.\r\nHoar, pointing his finger at the retreating figure, solemnly\r\nexclaimed, \"Not to be _brought back_ upon a motion to reconsider!\"\r\n\r\nAt a much later day the Senate was \"advising and consenting\" over the\r\nappointment of a distinguished gentleman whose name had just\r\nbeen sent in for confirmation as Ambassador to an important European\r\nCourt.  The gentleman in question had voted for the then incumbent\r\nof the great office, but his former political affiliations had been\r\nwholly with the opposing party.  The nomination was about being\r\nconfirmed without objection when Mr. Hoar, arising with apparent\r\nreluctance, said:\r\n\r\n\"As this is in some measure a family affair, Mr. President, I\r\nhesitate to interfere.  If our friends upon the opposite side of\r\nthe Chamber are satisfied with this appointment, I certainly shall\r\ninterpose no objection.  The gentleman named is well qualified,\r\nand has more than once held high place at the hands of the party\r\nwhich he has but recently deserted, and to which he will no\r\ndoubt return in due time.  We have, however, in New England an\r\nold-time custom, as sacred as if part of the written law, that if a\r\nman is so unfortunate as to lose his companion he will not marry\r\nagain within one year.  Now sir, I have always thought this rule, as\r\nto time, might well be applied to the matter of office-seeking.\r\nWhere a man has been repeatedly honored by his party as this\r\nappointee has been, but where, prompted by motives purely unselfish\r\nno doubt, he has gone over to the camp of the enemy, I think a due\r\nsense of modestly should impel him _to serve in the ranks at least\r\none year_ before being an applicant for high office at the hands\r\nof his newly found friends.\"\r\n\r\nComing over to the Democratic side of the Chamber, well to its\r\nfront sat the Hon. William R. Morrison of Illinois.  By virtue\r\nof his position as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means\r\nhe was the traditional leader of the House.  Possessing little\r\nof the brilliancy of the leader of the minority, Colonel Morrison was\r\nnone the less one of the ablest and most useful members of that\r\nbody.  He had for many sessions been a member of the House, and\r\nhad been a soldier in the Mexican and in the Civil War.  His record\r\nwas honorable, both as soldier and legislator.  He was the author of\r\nthe Tariff Bill which was fully debated during the first session\r\nof that Congress, and was in some measure a determining factor\r\nin the Presidential campaign that soon followed.  At a later\r\nday, Colonel Morrison was a prominent candidate for nomination\r\nas President by the national convention of his party.  His personal\r\nfriendships and antagonisms were well known.  It is related of him\r\nthat during a serious illness, apprehending that the dread messenger\r\nwas in near waiting, arousing himself to what appeared to be a last\r\neffort, he said in scarcely audible tones to a sorrowing colleague\r\nat his bedside:  \"I suppose when this is all over they will have\r\nsomething to say about me, as is the custom, in the House.  Well, if\r\nSpringer, and Cox, and Knott, and Stevenson want to talk, let them\r\ngo ahead, but if old Spears tries to speak _just cough him down.\"_\r\n\r\nNever in any political gathering has there been a more effective\r\nspeech, of a single sentence, than that in which Colonel\r\nMorrison presented to the Democratic caucus of the House members\r\nthe name of the \"Blind Preacher\" for Chaplain.  Three or four\r\ncandidates were already in nomination when Morrison arose and said:\r\n\"Mr. Chairman, I present for the office of Chaplain of the House\r\nthe name of Doctor Milburn, a man who loves God, pays his debts, and\r\nvotes the Democratic ticket!\"  Before the applause that followed\r\nhad entirely died away the names of his competitors were withdrawn,\r\nand the \"Blind Preacher\" was nominated by acclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. William M. Springer, of the same State, had just entered upon\r\nhis twenty years of continuous service in the House.  He came\r\npromptly to the front as a ready debater and skilful parliamentarian.\r\nHe was thoroughly educated, ambitious, and withal an excellent\r\nspeaker, and was the possessor in full measure of the _suaviter in\r\nmodo._  His personal popularity was great, and a more obliging,\r\nagreeable, and pleasing associate it would have been difficult to\r\nfind.  He was optimistic to the last degree.  To him every cloud\r\nhad a silver lining,--the lining generally concealing the cloud.\r\nIt was said of him by one of his colleagues that when the election\r\nreturns were coming in, showing overwhelming defeat to his party,--\r\neven before they were fully summed up,--Mr. Springer with\r\nbeaming countenance would promptly demonstrate by figures of his\r\nown how we were sure to be victorious four years later.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Carter H. Harrison was a prominent member of the Illinois\r\ndelegation.  He soon took high rank as an orator, and never failed\r\nto command the attention of the House.  Few speeches delivered\r\nduring that session of Congress were so generally published, or\r\nmore extensively quoted than were those of Mr. Harrison.  At the\r\nend of four years' service in Congress he was elected Mayor of\r\nChicago, an office he filled most acceptably for many years.\r\nHis tragic death, upon the concluding day of the great Exposition,\r\nwas universally deplored throughout the entire country.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John H. Reagan, of Texas, was a Representative in Congress\r\nbefore the war.  At its beginning he resigned his seat in the House,\r\nand cast in his fortunes with the South.  He was early selected\r\na member of the Davis Cabinet, and continued to discharge the duties\r\nof Postmaster-General until the fall of the Confederacy.  He was\r\na citizen of Texas while it was yet a Republic, and took an active\r\npart in securing its admission to the Federal Union.  Judge Reagan\r\nwas a gentleman of recognized ability, and of exceedingly courteous\r\nand dignified bearing.\r\n\r\nAn old-time statesman, on the same side of the Chamber, was the\r\nHon. Fernando Wood of New York.  A generation had passed since\r\nhe first entered Congress.  He was a Representative in the old hall\r\nof the Capitol while Webster, Calhoun, and Clay were in their prime.\r\nErect, stately, faultless in his attire, and of bearing almost\r\nchivalric, Mr. Wood was long one of the active and picturesque\r\npersonages of the House.  At the time whereof we write, his sands were\r\nalmost run, but, courageous to the last, he was in his accustomed seat\r\nbut a little time before the final summons came, and he died, as\r\nwas his wish, with the harness on.  All in all, we shall hardly\r\nsee his like again.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by his colleagues near the centre of the hall sat one\r\nof the most remarkable men of his day, philosopher, jurist, statesman,\r\norator, Lucius Q. C. Lamar of Mississippi.  In his early manhood\r\nhe was a member of the House, and even then was recognized as one of\r\nthe most brilliant of the many brilliant men his section had sent to\r\nthe national councils.  During the war his services in field and\r\ncouncil were given to the South, and something less than a decade\r\nafter the return of peace, Mr. Lamar, still in his prime, again\r\ntook his seat in the hall where his first laurels had been won.\r\nHis great speech--one that touched all hearts--was not long delayed;\r\nthe occasion was the day set apart in the House for tributes to\r\nthe memory of the lamented Sumner.  Many eulogies were delivered; that\r\nof Lamar still lingers in the memory of all who heard it.  \"The\r\ntheme was worthy the orator; the orator, the theme.\"  As a splendid\r\ntribute to a great tribune, as a plea for peace,--abiding, eternal,\r\nbetween all sections of a restored union,--it stands unsurpassed\r\namong the great masterpieces of ancient or modern eloquence.\r\n\r\nLater, Mr. Lamar was a prominent participant in one of the fiercest\r\ndebates the Senate has ever known.  A leading Senator upon the\r\nopposite side of the chamber, in advocating the passage of the\r\n\"Force bill,\" reflected bitterly upon Mississippi and her Senators.\r\nIn replying to the personal portion of the speech, Lamar said, \"the\r\nSenator has uttered upon this floor a falsehood--knowing it to\r\nbe such.  The language I have used, Mr. President, is severe.\r\nIt was so intended.  It is language, sir, that no honest man would\r\ndeserve, _and that no brave man will wear!\"_\r\n\r\nMr. Lamar was one of the most absent-minded of men.  A number of\r\nyears ago, by invitation of the Faculty, he delivered an address\r\nto the graduating class of Centre College, Kentucky.  The day\r\nwas quite warm, the exercises somewhat protracted, and, at the\r\nclose of his able and eloquent address, he was very much exhausted.\r\n\r\nAn excellent collation, prepared by the ladies connected with\r\nthe College, was served in the chapel near by, at the close of the\r\nexercises.  Seated upon the platform, with Mr. Lamar at the head\r\nof the table, were Doctor Young, the President, Justice Harlan,\r\nGovernor Knott, the Rev. Doctor Bullock, Chaplain of the Senate,\r\nJudge McCormick, and others.\r\n\r\nAt the plate of each guest a large tomato was in readiness and,\r\nexcellent itself, was, moreover, the earnest of better things to\r\ncome.  Immediately upon being seated, Mr. Lamar \"fell to\" and,\r\nwholly oblivious of the surroundings, soon made way with the one\r\nviand then in visible presence.  Just as its last vestige disappeared,\r\nthe President of the College arose and, with a solemnity eminently\r\nbefitting the occasion, called upon Doctor Bullock to offer thanks.\r\nDeeply chagrined, Mr. Lamar was an attentive listener to the\r\nimpressive invocation which immediately followed.  At its conclusion,\r\nwith troubled countenance, he turned to Knott and said, \"I am\r\nhumiliated at my conduct.  I should have remembered that Presbyterians\r\nalways say grace before meals, but I was very hungry and exhausted,\r\nand the tomato very tempting; I have really disgraced myself.\"  To\r\nwhich Knott replied, \"You ought not to feel so, Mr. Justice; the\r\nblessing of Doctor Bullock's was broad and general; in large measure\r\nretrospective as well as prospective.  It reminds me of a little\r\nincident that occurred on the 'Rolling Fork.'  An old-time deacon down\r\nthere was noted for the lengthy blessing which at his table was\r\nthe unfailing prelude to every meal.  His hired man, Bill Taylor, an\r\nunconverted and impatient youth, had fallen into the evil habit of\r\ncommencing his meal before the blessing thereon had been fully\r\ninvoked.  The frown and rebuke of the good deacon were alike\r\nunavailing in effecting the desired reform.  Righteously indignant\r\nthereat, the deacon, in a spirit possibly not the most devout,\r\nat length gave utterance to this petition, 'For what we are _about\r\nto_ receive, and for what William Taylor _has already_ received,\r\naccept our thanks, O Lord!\"\r\n\r\nIn cheery tones the great orator at once replied, \"Knott, you\r\nare the only man on earth who could have thought of such a story\r\njust at the opportune moment.\"  The temporary depression vanished;\r\nLamar was himself again, and was at once the brilliant conversationalist\r\nof the delighted assemblage.\r\n\r\nThe surviving members of that Congress will recall a little chair that\r\ndaily rolled down the aisle to the front to the Speaker's desk.\r\nIt contained the emaciated form of a man whose weight at his best was\r\nbut ninety pounds--Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, \"whose little\r\nbody lodged a mighty mind.\"  No one who saw Mr. Stephens could ever\r\nforget him.  He looked as though he had just stepped out from\r\nan old picture, or dropped down from the long-ago.  There was\r\nprobably as little about him \"of the earth, earthy\" as of any mortal\r\nthis world has known.  Upon his weak frame time had done its work,\r\nand, true it is, \"the surest poison is time.\"  And yet, his feeble\r\npiping voice--now scarcely heard an arm's length away--was potent in\r\nthe contentions of the great hall when he was the honored associate of\r\nmen whose public service reached back to the formation of the Government.\r\nIn the old hall near by--now the Valhalla of the nation--he had\r\nsat with John Quincy Adams and contemporaries whose names at\r\nonce recall the Revolutionary period.  After serving as Vice-President\r\nof the Confederacy, whose rise and fall he had witnessed, Mr.\r\nStephens, with the shadows falling about him, was, by unanimous\r\nvoice of his people, again, in his own words, \"in our father's\r\nhouse.\"  His apartments in the old National Hotel, as he never\r\nfailed to explain to his visitors, were those long ago occupied by\r\nhis political idol, Henry Clay.  His couch stood in the exact spot\r\nwhere Mr. Clay had died; and he no doubt thought--possibly wished--\r\nthat his own end might come just where that great Commoner had\r\nbreathed his last.  This, however, was not to be.  His last hours were\r\nspent at the capital of his native commonwealth, which had, with\r\nscarce a dissenting voice, just honored itself by electing him\r\nto its chief executive office.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Samuel J. Randall, of Pennsylvania, was the successor\r\nof the lamented Kerr as Speaker of the House.  As such he presided\r\nduring the last session of the forty-fourth Congress, and during\r\nthe two Congresses immediately succeeding.  He had long been a\r\nmember, coming in with Blaine and Garfield just before the close\r\nof the war.  Able, courageous, and thoroughly skilled in parliamentary\r\ntactics, he had achieved a national reputation as the leader of the\r\nminority in the forty-third Congress.  During the protracted and\r\nexciting struggle near its close, over the Force Bill--the House\r\nremaining in continuous session for fifty-six hours--Mr. Randall\r\nhad displayed wonderful endurance and marvellous capacity for\r\nsuccessful leadership.  He was more than once presented by his\r\nState in Democratic national conventions for nomination to the\r\nPresidency.  He was an excellent presiding officer, prompt,\r\noften aggressive, and was rarely vanquished in his many brilliant passages\r\nwith the leaders of the minority.  One incident is recalled, however,\r\nwhen the tables were turned against the Speaker, no one joining\r\nmore heartily than himself in the laugh that followed.  Mr. Conger,\r\nof Michigan, with great earnestness and persistency, was urging\r\nthe consideration of a resolution which the Speaker had repeatedly\r\ndeclared out of order.  By no means disconcerted by the decision, Mr.\r\nConger, walking down the aisle, was vehement in his demand for the\r\nimmediate consideration of his resolution.  At which the Speaker\r\nwith much indignation said, \"Well, I think the Chair has a right\r\nto exercise a little common sense in this matter.\"  To which Mr.\r\nConger instantly responded, \"Oh, if the Chair has the slightest\r\nintention of _doing anything of that kind,_ I will immediately take\r\nmy seat!\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. David Dudley Field, elected to fill a vacancy, was a\r\nRepresentative from the city of New York during the closing session\r\nof the forty-fourth Congress.  He was an eminent lawyer, and, at\r\nthe time, stood at the head of the American bar.  His name is\r\ninseparably associated with many important reforms in legal procedure\r\nduring the last half century.  He had been instrumental in securing\r\nthe appointment of a committee of distinguished jurists, chosen\r\nfrom the leading nations, to prepare the outlines of an international\r\ncode.  His report accompanying the plan, to the preparation of\r\nwhich he had given much thought and time, received the earnest\r\ncommendation of leading publicists and jurists in Europe, as well as\r\nin his own country.  His untiring efforts, looking to the substitution\r\nof international courts of arbitration for war, have given his name\r\nhonored place among the world's benefactors.\r\n\r\nMr. Field was the eldest of four brothers, whose names are known\r\nwherever our language is spoken.  The family was distinguished for\r\ntalents of the highest order.  It would indeed be difficult to find\r\nits counterpart in our history.  One of the brothers, Stephen J.\r\nField, was for a third of a century a distinguished justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.  The youngest, Dr. Henry M.\r\nField, was eminent alike as theologian and author.  The name of\r\nthe remaining brother, Cyrus W. Field, is, and will continue, a\r\nhousehold word in two hemispheres.  After repeated failures, to\r\nthe verge even of extremity, \"the trier of spirits,\" the dream of his\r\nlife became a reality.  The Atlantic cable was laid, and, in the words\r\nof John Bright, Mr. Field had \"moored the New World alongside the Old.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Henry Watterson, of Kentucky, was a representative during\r\nthe closing session of Congress.  As the editor of a great journal,\r\nMr. Watterson was already well known to the country.  His talents were\r\nof a high order.  In his chosen field he had no superior.  For many\r\nyears he was a recognized leader of his party, and one of the chief\r\nmanagers in all its national conventions.  His contributions to the\r\nliterature of three decades of political campaigns were almost\r\nunparalleled.  As a forcible, trenchant writer he is to be mentioned\r\nwith Greeley, Raymond, Prentice, and Dana.  His career, too, as\r\na public lecturer, has been both successful and brilliant.  The\r\nCongressional service of Mr. Watterson terminated with the session\r\njust mentioned.  His speech, near its close, upon the bill creating\r\nan electoral commission to determine the Tilden-Hayes Presidential\r\ncontroversy was listened to with earnest attention, and at once\r\ngave him high place among the great debaters of that eventful\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nWhile a passenger on a train to Washington, to be present at the\r\nopening of Congress, my attention was directed to a man of venerable\r\nappearance, who entered the sleeping-car at a station not many\r\nmiles out from Cincinnati.  He was dressed in \"Kentucky jeans\" and\r\nhad the appearance of a well-to-do farmer.  Standing in the aisle near\r\nme, he was soon engaged in earnest conversation with the porter,\r\nendeavoring to secure a berth.  The porter repeatedly assured\r\nhim that this was impossible, as every berth was taken.  He told the\r\nporter that he was quite ill, and must get on his journey.  I then\r\nproposed that he share my berth for the night.  He gladly did so\r\nuntil other accommodations were provided.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday following, when the House was in the process of\r\norganization, the name of James D. Williams of Indiana being called,\r\nmy sleeping-car acquaintance, still attired in blue jeans, stepped\r\nforward with his colleagues to the Speaker's desk and was duly\r\nsworn in as a member of Congress.  This was his first term, but he\r\nsoon became quite well known to the country.  As chairman of the\r\nCommittee of Accounts, having to do with small expenditures, he\r\nclosely scrutinized every claim presented, and scaled to the lowest\r\nmany pet measures.  His determination to economize, as well as his\r\npeculiarity of dress and appearance, soon made him an especial\r\nobject of amusement to newspaper correspondents.  He was the butt of\r\nmany cheap jokes; one being his alleged complaint that hundreds of\r\ntowels were being daily used by members at the Capitol, at the\r\npublic expense, while at his home, on his farm, one towel would\r\nlast a week, with eleven in the family.  Despite, however, all\r\njokes and gibes, he soon became the most popular man in his State.\r\n\"Blue Jeans Williams\" became a name to conjure with; and in the\r\ncelebrated campaign of 1876, after an exciting contest, he was\r\nelected Governor, defeating an able and popular leader, who, twelve\r\nyears later, was himself elected President of the United States.\r\n\r\nNo sketch of \"the American Commons\" during the last fifty years\r\nwould be in any measure complete that failed to make mention of\r\nthe man who was nineteen times elected a Representative, the\r\nHon. William S. Holman, of Indiana.  Whatever the ups and downs of\r\nparty supremacy, despite all attempts by gerrymandering to relegate\r\nhim to the shades of private life, Judge Holman, with unruffled\r\nfront, \"a mien at once kindly, persuasive, and patient,\" held\r\nsturdily on his way.  Amid political upheavals that overwhelmed\r\nall his associates upon the ticket, his name, like that of Abou Ben\r\nAdhem, led all the rest.  From Pierce to McKinley--whatever the\r\nissues, and howsoever determined--at each successive organization of\r\nthe House \"the gentleman from Indiana\" was an unfailing respondent\r\nto the opening roll-call.  An old English stanza comes to mind:\r\n\r\n  \"And this is law, that I'll maintain\r\n  Until my dying day, sir,\r\n  That whatsoever King shall reign,\r\n  Still I'll be vicar of Bray, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHis integrity was unquestioned; his knowledge of public business,\r\nphenomenal.  With no brilliancy, little in the way of oratory, Judge\r\nHolman was nevertheless one of the most valuable members ever known to\r\nthe House of Representatives.  The Lobby regarded him as its mortal foe.\r\nHe was for years the recognized \"watch-dog of the Treasury.\"  Personal\r\nappeals to his courtesy, to permit the present consideration of private\r\nbills, had, in the main, as well have been made to a marble statue.\r\nHis well known and long to be remembered, \"I object, Mr. Speaker,\"\r\nsounded the knell of many a well devised raid upon the Treasury.  It\r\nmay be that he sometimes prevented the early consideration of meritorious\r\nmeasures, but with occasional exceptions his objections were\r\nwholesome.  He kept in close touch with the popular pulse, and\r\nknew, as if by instinct, which would be the safe and which the\r\ndangerous side of the pending measure.  It sometimes seemed that\r\nhe could even \"look into the seeds of time and tell which grain\r\nwill grow and which will not.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that even great men have at times their little\r\nweaknesses.  An incident to be related will show that possibly\r\nJudge Holman was no exception to that rule.  The consideration\r\nof sundry bills for the erection of post-office buildings in a\r\nnumber of districts having \"gone over\" by reason of his objection,\r\nthe members having the bills in charge joined forces and lumped\r\nthe several measures into an \"omnibus bill\" which was duly presented.\r\nThe members especially interested in its passage, to \"make assurance\r\ndoubly sure,\" had quietly inserted a provision for the erection of a\r\nGovernment building in one of the cities of Holman's district.  When\r\nthe bill was read, Judge Holman, as he sat busily writing at his\r\ndesk, was, without solicitation upon his part, the closely observed\r\nof every member.  Apparently oblivious, however, to all that was\r\noccurring, he continued to write.  No objection being made, the\r\nbill was in the very act of passing when an exceedingly bright\r\nmember from Wisconsin, \"being moved and instigated by the devil,\" no\r\ndoubt, rushed to the front and exclaimed, \"Mr. Speaker, I desire\r\nto call the attention of the gentleman from the fourth district of\r\nIndiana to the fact that the Treasury is being robbed!\"  Unmoved\r\nby the appeal, the Judge continued to write, and, as one of his\r\ncolleagues afterwards remarked, \"was chewing his tobacco very fine.\"\r\nAfter a moment of suspense, and amid applause in which even the\r\ngalleries took part, the member from Wisconsin, in tragic tones,\r\nexclaimed, \"Ah, Mr. Speaker, our watch-dog of the Treasury, like\r\nall other good watch-dogs, _never barks when his friends are\r\naround!\"_\r\n\r\nMr. Blackburn, of Kentucky, began his long and eventful legislative\r\ncareer as a member of this Congress.  As the representative of the\r\nAshland District, he was the successor of Clay, Crittenden, Marshall,\r\nBreckenridge, Beck--illustrious names in the history of the State and\r\nof the nation.  He was worthy of the succession, and, at the close\r\nof ten years' service in the House, was elected to the Senate.  He\r\ncame within a few votes of being chosen as the candidate of his\r\nparty for Speaker at the opening of the forty-sixth Congress.  He\r\nwas a born orator.  It was as natural for him to speak as to breathe.\r\nWake him up at any hour of the night, and he would be ready upon\r\nthe instant for an eloquent speech of any length, upon any subject.\r\nThoroughly familiar with all that pertained to our political history,\r\nwith a voice easily heard above the storm, he was ever in the\r\nforefront of the hurly-burly of heated partisan debate.  There was\r\nlittle that was conciliatory about him.  He neither gave nor asked\r\nquarter.  A born fighter, he had rather\r\n\r\n  \"Follow his enemy through a fiery gulf,\r\n  Than flatter him in a bower.\"\r\n\r\nPossessing neither the keen wit of his colleague, McKenzie, nor\r\nthe profound humor of Knott, he was nevertheless the hero of\r\nmore interesting narratives than any member who ever crossed the\r\nBlue Ridge Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe incident to be related may have suggested the witty reply of\r\nSenator Proctor to the Vice-President when invited by the latter\r\nto come into the devotional exercises:  \"Excuse me, I am _paired_ with\r\nBlackburn on prayers.\"  This equals his reply when asked by Senator\r\nHale what he thought of Senator Chandler:  \"I _like_ him, but it\r\nis an acquired taste.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the occasion of the retirement of the Rev. Dr. Butler from\r\nthe Chaplaincy of the Senate--a position he had filled most acceptably\r\nfor many years--many of the Senators spoke regretfully of his\r\nretirement.  The speech of Mr. Blackburn, for beauty of expression\r\nand pathetic eloquence, was unrivalled.  He spoke most tenderly of\r\nthe faithfulness of the venerable man of God; how for long years\r\nhe had gone in and out before us; of his daily walk and conversation;\r\nhow, like the Blessed Master, his only thought was of doing good;\r\nof how he had often invoked the Divine blessing upon us and our\r\nloved ones, and lifted us as it were in his arms up to the very\r\nthrone of grace.  The orator seemed inspired, as though his lips\r\nwere indeed touched with a live coal from the altar.  The counterpart\r\nof the scene that followed his closing words had never been witnessed\r\nin legislative assembly.  All were in tears.  It was even said that\r\nvenerable Senators, who had never shed a tear since the ratification\r\nof the treaty of Ghent, actually sobbed aloud, and refused to be\r\ncomforted.  At length, amid silence that could be felt, an adjournment\r\nwas effected, and the Senators passed sadly out to their homes.\r\nAs he passed the Chair, Senator Vest, in undertone, remarked to\r\nthe Vice-President, _\"Jo never saw him!\"_\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the absence of his successor, \"the blind chaplain,\"\r\nDr. Butler again, and for the last time, officiated, simply repeating\r\nin manner most solemn and impressive, the Lord's Prayer.  At its\r\nconclusion, Senator Blackburn, who had been a most attentive\r\nlistener, came forward to the desk and remarked to Vice-President\r\nStevenson:  \"I tell you, sir, I like that new chaplain of ours.\r\nWhat a splendid prayer!  There is something _original_ about that man!\"\r\n\r\nThirty years and more ago, when first a candidate for Congress,\r\nMr. Blackburn attended a public execution--in common parlance \"a\r\nhanging\"--in one of the counties in his district.  Being a gentleman\r\nof great distinction, and a candidate for Congress, he was\r\nappropriately invited by the sheriff to occupy a seat with the\r\nprisoner and his spiritual adviser upon the gallows.  At the\r\nnear approach of the fatal hour, the sheriff, with watch in hand, amid\r\nthe sea of upturned faces, stated to the prisoner that he had\r\nyet five minutes to live, and it was his privilege if he so desired\r\nto address the audience.  The prisoner meekly replied that he\r\ndid not wish to speak.  Whereupon Mr. Blackburn, stepping promptly\r\nto the front of the scaffold, said:  \"As the gentleman does not\r\nwish to speak, if he will kindly yield me his time, I will take\r\nthis occasion to remark that I am a candidate for Congress, regularly\r\nnominated by the Democratic Convention,\" etc.  This incident being\r\ntold in the presence of Mr. Marshall, the opposing candidate,\r\nthe latter remarked that he remembered it well, and could vouch\r\nfor its truth.  He then added that when Mr. Blackburn proposed\r\nto speak out the prisoner's time, the latter turned to the Sheriff\r\nand inquired who that was.  To which the officer replied, \"Captain\r\nBlackburn.\"  At this the prisoner, who had amid all the exciting\r\nscenes of his arrest and trial, and even up to the present moment,\r\nwith his open coffin beside him, displayed marvellous fortitude,\r\nsuddenly exhibiting deep emotion, piteously exclaimed, \"Please hang\r\nme first, _and let him speak afterwards!\"_\r\n\r\nWhen, in the tide of time, will the House of Representatives witness\r\nthe like of \"Sunset\" Cox?  Beginning a Congressional career, which\r\nwas to terminate only with his death, when scarcely of the\r\nconstitutional age, he was in close succession a representative\r\nfrom two great States,--in his early manhood from the Capital\r\ndistrict of Ohio, and in his maturer years, even down to old age, the\r\nmost prominent of the delegation from the great State of New York.\r\nMr. Cox was gifted as few men have been in this world.  His literary\r\nattainments were of a high order, and some of the books of which\r\nhe was the author will no doubt furnish instructive and entertaining\r\nreading for many generations to come.  He was an indefatigable\r\nstudent, and seemed, as did Lord Bacon, to have \"taken all knowledge\r\nfor his province.\"  His accurate knowledge of the history of all\r\ncountries and times was a marvel, and, all at his instant command,\r\nplaced him upon rare vantage ground in the many forensic struggles\r\nin which he took part.  Woe betide the unfortunate antagonist whose\r\nrecord was other than faultless.  He was a born debater, full of\r\nresources, and aggressive to the last degree.  He never waited for\r\nopportunities, but sought them.  In great emergencies he was often\r\nput forward by his political associates for the fierce encounter\r\nwith the great leaders upon the opposite side of the Chamber.\r\nHe was withal one of the most kindly of men.  He was the soul of\r\npersonal and official honor.  His integrity could know no\r\ntemptation.  It may truly be said of him that--\r\n\r\n  \"Whatever record leaps to light,\r\n  He never can be shamed.\"\r\n\r\nHis sympathies were deeply enlisted for the safety of those \"who\r\ngo down to the sea in ships.\"  For years he was the earnest advocate\r\nof a thorough life-saving system.  Much of the present efficiency of\r\nthis humane branch of the public service is due to his untiring\r\nefforts.  He had travelled to all countries, and even to the islands\r\nof the sea.  He was of sunny disposition, and believed that \"whatever\r\nplaces the eye of Heaven visits are to the wise man ports and happy\r\nhavens.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cox was one of the most genial and delightful of associates.\r\nWith him and Vance, Knott, and Randolph Tucker as companions for\r\nthe social hour, the night would flee away like a shadow.  His wit\r\nwas of the rarest order.  He would have been on terms of recognized\r\nkinship with Sydney Smith and Charles Lamb.  He once said of a\r\nvinegar-visaged member that the only regret he had on earth was\r\nthat there were no more commandments to keep; what few there were he\r\nkept so easily.  As illustrating his readiness and elasticity,\r\nwhatever the emergency, two instances, out of the many that crowd\r\nupon memory, will be given.  During an all-night session of the\r\nHouse, amid great confusion, the roll-call was ordered.  The first\r\nname, \"Mr. Archer,\" was called, and the response \"Aye\" was given.\r\nThe clerk, failing to hear the response, immediately repeated, \"Mr.\r\nArcher,\" to which the latter, in tones heard above the din of many\r\nvoices, again answered \"Aye.\"  Instantly Mr. Cox exclaimed:\r\n\"Insatiate Archer, would not one suffice?\"\r\n\r\nA new member from a district far to the westward entered the House.\r\nHis advoirdupois was in keeping with the vast territorial area\r\nhe represented.  As a wit, he was without a rival in his section.\r\nThe admiration of his constituents over the marvellous attainments\r\nof the new member, scarcely exceeded his own.  Only the opportunity\r\nwas wanting when the star of the gentleman from New York should go\r\ndown and his own be in the ascendant.  The opportunity at length\r\ncame.  Mr. Cox was the victim of the hour; the recipient of many\r\ncompliments much more fervid than kind.  The seven vials of wrath were\r\nopened upon him.  A vast storehouse of wit, ancient and modern,\r\nwas literally exhausted for the occasion.  Even the diminutive size\r\nof the New York member was mentioned in terms of disparagement.\r\nThe speech caused much merriment in the House during its delivery,\r\nand its author with an air of self-satisfaction rarely witnessed\r\neven in that body, resumed his seat.  Mr. Cox at once took the\r\nfloor.  No attempt will be made to do justice to his speech.\r\nThe manner, the tone of voice, which caused an uproar upon the\r\nfloor and in the galleries, can never find their way into print.\r\nReferring to the ill-mannered allusion to his size, he said \"that his\r\nconstituents preferred a representative with brains, rather than\r\none whose only claims to distinction consisted in an abnormal\r\nabdominal development.\"  In tragic tones he then pronounced a\r\nfuneral eulogy over his assailant, and suggested, as a fitting\r\ninscription for his tombstone, the pathetic words of Byron,\r\n\r\n  \"'T is Greece, but living Greece no more!\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the nomination of Tilden for President, Mr. Cox was\r\ninvited to attend a political meeting at the State capital, and\r\naddress the Democracy of Vermont.  When the scarcity of Democrats in\r\nthe Green Mountain State is taken into account, the significance\r\nof Mr. Cox's reply will readily appear.  His telegram was to the\r\neffect that pressing engagements prevented his attending, but\r\n\"if the Democracy of Vermont _will drop into my library_ any\r\nafternoon, about four o'clock, I will address them with great\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\nIn attempting to write something of a member so long and so favorably\r\nknown to the House as the Hon. J. Proctor Knott of Kentucky, I\r\nam reminded of the opening sentences of the touching tribute of\r\nJudge Baldwin to an honored associate:\r\n\r\n\"I nib my pen and impart to it a fine hair stroke in order that\r\nI may give the more delicate touch which can alone show forth\r\nthe character of this distinguished gentleman.  If I hold the pen in\r\nhand in idle reverie, it is because my mind rests lovingly upon\r\na picture I feel incapable of transcribing with fidelity to the\r\noriginal; and therefore I pause a moment to look once more at\r\nthe original, before it is obscured by the rude counterpart.\"\r\n\r\nIt was worth while to have known Proctor Knott, to have been his\r\ncotemporary in public life, the sharer of his confidence, the guest\r\nat his hearthstone.  In the highest sense of the expression, he\r\nwas a gentleman of the old school.  To him there was rare meaning in\r\nthe words, \"Old wood to burn!  Old wine to drink!  Old friends\r\nto trust!\"\r\n\r\nHe was as familiar with the Bible, with Shakespeare, and Burns, as\r\nthough he had written them.  His quotations, whether in private\r\nconversation, or in public speech, were always timely.  There\r\nwas little in the way of the best literature, ancient or modern,\r\nthat he had not read.  As was truly said of the gifted Prentiss:\r\n\r\n\"His imagination was colored and imbued with the light of the\r\nshadowy past.  He lingered spell-bound among the scenes of mediaeval\r\nchivalry.  His spirit had dwelt until almost naturalized in the\r\nmystic dreamland of the Paladins, Crusaders, and Knights Templars;\r\nwith Monmouth and Percy, with Bois-Guilbert and Ivanhoe and the\r\nbold McGregor; with the Cavaliers of Rupert, and the iron enthusiasts\r\nof Fairfax.\"\r\n\r\nHe was the inveterate hater of shams of all kinds, and of mere\r\npretenders of every description.  He ever avoided the short cuts, and\r\nkept steadily along in the old way.  His heroes, like those of\r\nDickens, were taken from the common walk; the men he had met in\r\nthe road and at the hustings, at whose firesides he had passed many\r\nhours.  Whatever concerned them, whatever involved in any manner\r\ntheir welfare, was of deep interest to him.  If he had chosen\r\nhis own epitaph it might have read:\r\n\r\n  \"In common ways, with common men,\r\n  I served my race and time.\"\r\n\r\nHe was both an artist and a poet.  He loved flowers, and there was\r\nto his ears no music so sweet as the merry laughter of children.\r\nAnd, whether in private life, or in his great executive office\r\nas \"the arbiter of human fate,\" the tale of woe never failed to\r\ntouch a sympathetic cord.  He had in very deed,\r\n\r\n  \"A tear for pity, and a hand open as day to melting\r\n  charity.\"\r\n\r\nHe was welcome at every hearthstone, as one \"who cometh unto you\r\nwith a tale which holdeth children from play, and old men from the\r\nchimney corner.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after his admission to the bar, Mr. Knott removed to Missouri,\r\nwhere he was almost immediately elected to the responsible position\r\nof Attorney-General of the State.  In due time he returned to\r\nhis native State, and was for six terms a representative in Congress.\r\nYet later, and as the shadows were beginning to fall to the eastward,\r\nhe was, almost by common acclaim, called to the chief executive\r\noffice of the commonwealth.  It may truly be said of him that \"with\r\nclear head, and with clean hands, he faithfully discharged every\r\npublic trust.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Knott entered Congress just at the close of the great Civil\r\nWar.  It was a period of excitement throughout the entire country,\r\nand of intense foreboding to the section he represented.  In the\r\ndebates of that stormy period he bore no mean part.  He was counted\r\na foeman worthy the steel of the ablest who entered the lists.\r\nA thorough student from the beginning, of all that pertained to\r\nMagna Charta, the Bill of Rights, and the Federal Constitution, he\r\nwas equipped as few men have been, for forensic contests that have\r\nleft their deep impress upon history.  The evidence of his ability\r\nas a lawyer is to be found in the satisfactory manner in which for\r\nthree Congresses he discharged the duties of the trying position\r\nof Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives.\r\nThe ablest lawyers of both political parties constituted this great\r\ncommittee, and its chairman, if possessing only mediocre talents\r\nor attainments, would have been sadly out of place.\r\n\r\nBut with his heavy armor laid aside, the genius of Knott was\r\nmade manifest along more pleasing lines.  Few speeches ever delivered\r\nin Congress have been so generally read, or so thoroughly imbedded\r\ninto current literature, as one he delivered soon after his\r\nfirst admission to the House.  Duluth awoke the morning after\r\nits delivery to find itself famous.  As, \"the zenith city of the\r\nunsalted seas,\" it has been known and read of all men.  As such,\r\nit will probably continue to be known for ages to come.  The speech\r\nhopelessly defeated a bill making a land grant to a proposed\r\nrailroad, of which Duluth was to be the terminus.  His mirthful\r\nprediction, however, as to its marvellous future has been fulfilled.\r\nHow true it is that \"jesters do oft prove prophets!\"  Bearing in\r\nmind that the great city of to-day then had no place even upon the\r\nmap, the words quoted from the speech will be appreciated:\r\n\r\n\"Duluth, Duluth!  The word fell upon my ear with peculiar and\r\nindescribable charm, like the gentle murmur of a brook stealing\r\nforth in the midst of roses, or the soft sweet accent of an angel's\r\nwhisper in the bright joyous dream of sleeping innocence.  Duluth!\r\n'T was the name for which my soul had panted for years, as the hart\r\npanteth for the water brooks.  I was convinced that the greatest\r\ncalamity that ever befell the benighted nations of the ancient\r\nworld was their having passed away without a knowledge of the actual\r\nexistence of Duluth; that their fabled Atlantis, never seen save\r\nby the hallowed vision of inspired poesy, was in fact but another name\r\nfor Duluth; that the golden orchard of the Hesperides was but a\r\npoetical synonym for the beer-gardens in the vicinity of Duluth.  As\r\nthat name first fell upon my ear, a resplendent scene of ineffable\r\nglory opened before me, such as I imagine burst upon the enraptured\r\nvisions of the wandering Peri through the opening gates of\r\nParadise.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Knott was often the sad and silent man.  His real intimacies\r\nwere few, and to strangers he was reserved.  But to those who came\r\nwithin the circle of his personal friendship he was one of the most\r\ndelightful of companions.  No man was ever given less to a\r\nparade either of his friendships or of his animosities.  His enemies\r\n--and it would have been strange if, passing through the eventful scenes\r\nhe did, he had had none--knew just where to find him.  He was,\r\nin very truth,\r\n\r\n  \"Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;\r\n  But, to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause often of mirth in others, he was at times far from being\r\njoyous himself.  Few men have been the possessors in so rare degree\r\nof the gift of humor, the sure indication of the humane and\r\nsympathetic in our nature; that \"which blends the pathetic with\r\nthe ludicrous, and by the same stroke moves to laughter and to\r\ntears.\"  As Emerson says, \"Both an ornament and a safeguard--genius\r\nitself.\"  The line of separation between wit and humor is shadowy,\r\nnot easily defined.  There may be in the same individual, in\r\nsome measure, a blending of the two.  As has been said:  \"While\r\nwit is a purely intellectual thing, into every act of the humorous\r\nmind there is an influx of the moral nature.  Humor springs up\r\nexuberantly, as from a fountain, and runs on, its perpetual game\r\nto look with considerate good-nature at every object in existence,\r\nand dismiss it with a benison.\"  While wit, the purely intellectual\r\nquality, sparkles and stings, humor, \"touched with a feeling of\r\nour infirmity,\" would \"gently scan thy brother man,\" remembering\r\never that\r\n\r\n  \"What's done we partly may compute,\r\n  But know not what's resisted.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not strange, then, that he who in large degree possesses\r\nor is possessed by this subtle quality should be subject to moods,\r\nit may be melancholy--\"the effect of that humor that sometime hath\r\nhis hour with every man.\"  That Governor Knott was deeply endowed with\r\nhumor in its best sense, no one who knew him could doubt.  In\r\nrelating incidents that convulsed his listeners, he gave no\r\nsign; his own features remained as solemn as if he were attending the\r\nobsequies of his dearest friend.  There is something that is\r\nsuggestive in the lines of Thomas Hood,\r\n\r\n  \"There's not a string attuned to mirth\r\n  But has its chord in melancholy.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Governor of Kentucky, he sent to the Hon. Stoddart Johnson\r\na certificate, officially signed and bearing the impress of the\r\ngreat seal of State, duly commissioning him as \"Mister,\" a distinctive\r\nand honorable title that no Kentuckian had previously borne.  This\r\nrecalls the witty remark of Max O'Rell:  \"The only thing that\r\nMr. Ingersoll appears to hold in common with his countrymen _is\r\nthe title of Colonel.\"_\r\n\r\nMany years ago McCullough, the tragedian, was giving his\r\nsplendid impersonations of the two masterpieces of Shakespeare\r\nat the national Capital.  The morning following one of these,\r\nMr. Knott and I, passing along the avenue on our way to the House,\r\nwere stopped by an exceedingly solemn-visaged individual who,\r\naddressing the former, said:  \"Mr. Knott, I would like to have your\r\njudgment as to which is the best play, _Hamlet_ or _Macbeth.\"_\r\n\r\nGazing earnestly at his inquisitor, and in a tone at once deprecatory\r\nand inimitable, Knott replied:  \"My friend, don't ask me that\r\nquestion.  I am a politician, and a candidate for re-election to\r\nCongress; my district is about equally divided; Hamlet has his\r\nfriends down there, and Macbeth his, and I am unwilling _to take\r\nany part between them!\"_\r\n\r\nWhen in joint canvass with his competitor for the Governorship\r\nof the State, Mr. Knott, having, by appointment, at one of the\r\ncounty seats in \"the Purchase,\" made the opening speech, was seated\r\nnear by to listen to that of the opposing candidate.  The latter, a\r\ngentleman having a high sense of propriety, and a dignity of bearing\r\nthat would have done no discredit to an assembly of divines, had\r\nbeen exceedingly annoyed by Knott's speech, which had in very truth\r\nkept the audience in an uproar during its entire delivery.  Beginning\r\nhis reply, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, I will endeavor to indicate to you the kind of\r\na man who, in my judgment, should be elected to the position of\r\nGovernor of this grand old commonwealth.  In the first place, that\r\nexalted position would never be filled by one who, for lack of\r\nserious argument, constantly appeals to the risibilities of his\r\naudience; never by a wit, a mere joker, a story-teller; in other\r\nwords--if you will pardon me, my fellow-citizens--by a mere buffoon.\r\nOn the contrary, the incumbent of the exalted position of chief\r\nexecutive of this grand old commonwealth should be a gentleman\r\nof character, of ability, the worthy successor of Shelby, of\r\nMorehead, of Crittenden; he should be a gentleman of scholastic\r\nattainments and of dignified bearing, well versed in classic lore\r\nand a thorough student of the higher order of state-craft.  In a\r\nword, fellow-citizens, you should elect as your Governor a gentleman\r\nof lofty character, of ripe scholarship, of commanding dignity, of\r\nexalted statesmanship, of ----\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, Knott, interrupting, said, in manner and tone the\r\nexact counterpart of that of the speaker, \"Pardon me, Colonel Smith,\r\nbut I am too modest a man to listen longer to the beautiful and\r\ntruthful description _you have just given of me!\"_\r\n\r\nWhereupon, amidst the wildest applause, he retired from the hall, as\r\ndid the audience, and the speaking for the day, and the joint\r\ndiscussion for the campaign, were closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nAGAIN IN CONGRESS\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN THE PERSONNEL OF THE HOUSE CONTRASTED WITH THOSE IN THE\r\nBRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS--LEVI P. MORTON--MR. COVERT AND MR. SHELLEY\r\n--GEN. JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON--TWO NOTABLE SPEECHES BY JAMES A. McKENZIE\r\n--JOHN E. KENNA--BENJAMIN BUTTERWORTH--MR. KEIFER OF OHIO--MR.\r\nCARLISLE OF KENTUCKY--SPEAKER REED--PRESIDENT McKINLEY--THE WRITER'S\r\nSPEECH AT THE PEACE JUBILEE BANQUET, 1898.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of two years I was returned to the forty-sixth\r\nCongress.  Circumstances over which I had no control had prevented\r\nmy taking a seat in the intervening Congress, my successful competitor\r\nbeing the Hon. Thomas F. Tipton.  In politics, however, as in\r\nother things, \"the whirligig of time brings in his revenges,\" and I\r\nwas in turn the successful competitor of my late opponent in his\r\ncandidacy for re-election.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, many changes had occurred in the personnel of the House.\r\nMany familiar names had been dropped from its roll.  Of these, nine\r\nhad been transferred to that of the Senate, a former member was\r\nnow in the Cabinet, and Mr. Wheeler of New York was Vice-President.\r\nA significant fact in this connection, and one illustrating the\r\nuncertainty of the tenure by which place is held in that body, was\r\nthat more than one-third of those with whom I had so recently served\r\nwere now in private life.  Possibly no feature of our governmental\r\nsystem causes more astonishment to intelligent foreigners than the\r\nmany changes biennially occurring in the membership of the House\r\nof Representatives.  There is marked difference between the British\r\nHouse of Commons, and the popular branch of the American Congress.\r\nA seat lost in the latter--it may be by a single unfortunate\r\nutterance, or unpopular vote--is usually a seat lost forever; while\r\nin the former, membership may continue for an almost indefinite\r\nperiod, and until an \"appeal to the country\" by the Ministry upon a\r\nnew and vital issue.  If defeated by one constituency, the member of\r\nParliament may soon be returned by another, the question of residence\r\nhaving no significance.  In fact if possessing superior talents,\r\nthe member is liable to be chosen by two or more constituencies at\r\nthe same election, the choice then resting with himself as to which\r\nhe will represent.  Such has been the experience of the most eminent\r\nof British statesmen.  The names of Burke, Peel, Gladstone, and\r\nBalfour, quite recently, will readily be recalled in this connection.\r\nIn the little island the aspirant to legislative honors has several\r\nhundred constituencies from which to choose, or be chosen, while\r\nin the larger America his political fortunes are usually bound\r\nup in his own residence district.\r\n\r\nUpon the roll of the House in the new Congress, called in\r\nspecial session in March, 1879, in addition to some heretofore\r\nmentioned, were names well known to the country.  Of these none is\r\nmore worthy of honorable mention than that of the Hon. Levi P.\r\nMorton of New York.  In the business world his name was a synonym for\r\nintegrity.  The head of a great banking house, he was almost as\r\nwell known in the principal cities of Europe as in the great city of\r\nhis residence.  At the time of his first election to Congress\r\nMr. Morton was, by appointment of the President, an honorary\r\ncommissioner to the Paris Exposition.  At the close of his legislative\r\ncareer he held successively the honored positions of Ambassador to\r\nFrance, Vice-President of the United States, and Governor of New\r\nYork.  In Congress, Mr. Morton was the able representative of a\r\ngreat constituency; as chief executive of his State his name is\r\nworthy of mention with the most eminent of those who have been\r\ncalled to that exalted station; as ambassador to a foreign court\r\nthe honor of his country was ever in safe keeping; as Vice-President,\r\nhe was the model presiding officer over the greatest deliberative body\r\nknown to men.\r\n\r\nOne of the brightest members of the New York delegation was the\r\nHon. James W. Covert of Flushing.  Altogether he served ten years in\r\nthe House, and became in time one of its leading members.  He was an\r\nexcellent lawyer, a delightful associate, and an able and ready debater.\r\nThat he was gifted with a touch of the humorous will appear from the\r\nfollowing.  The House was passing through the agony of an all-night\r\nsession.  Confusion reigned supreme.  During it all, Mr. Shelley, from\r\none of the Gulf States, stood at his desk and repeatedly made the point\r\nof order upon Covert, Springer, Kenna, McKenzie, and others, as they\r\nsuccessively addressed the Chair, that \"The gentleman is not speaking\r\nfrom his desk.\"  The point of order was as repeatedly sustained by\r\nthe Speaker, the rules requiring members to address the Chair only\r\nfrom their respective desks.  The confusion at length became so\r\ngreat that many members, in their eagerness to be heard, pressed\r\nto the front.  The voice of Mr. Shelley, however, was heard above the\r\ndin still calling for the enforcement of the rule; to which the\r\nSpeaker, his patience exhausted, now turned a deaf ear.  Desperate\r\nbeyond measure, Mr. Shelley at length _left his own desk,_ and\r\ntaking his position immediately in front of the clerk's desk fiercely\r\ndemanded, \"Mr.  Speaker, I call for the enforcement of the rule.\"\r\nAt which Covert immediately exclaimed, \"Mr. Speaker, I call for the\r\nenforcement of _the rule in Shelley's case!\"_\r\n\r\nAlmost directly in front of the Speaker's desk sat a gentleman,\r\nsmall in stature, and of quiet dignified bearing, \"The silent man,\"\r\n\"whose voice was in his sword,\" General Joseph E. Johnston of\r\nVirginia.  Until this, his first election to Congress from the\r\nCapital District of the Old Dominion, he had known none other than\r\nmilitary public service.  He was a born soldier.  No one who saw\r\nhim could mistake his calling.  Napoleon did not more truly look\r\nthe soldier than did General Johnston.  A graduate of West Point, his\r\nfirst service was in the Black Hawk War, and later in Mexico.  For\r\ngallant conduct at the battle of Cerro Gordo, he was brevetted\r\ncolonel in the regular army.  His last service was when, as\r\nLieutenant-General of the Confederate Army, he surrendered to\r\nSherman, thus ending the great Civil War.  He had already reached the\r\nallotted threescore years and ten when he entered Congress, and\r\nits ordinary details apparently interested him but little.  He\r\nearnestly desired the return of the era of good feeling between\r\nthe North and South, and upon his motion the House duly adjourned in\r\nhonor of the day set apart for the decoration of the graves of\r\nUnion soldiers.\r\n\r\nNo member of this House attracted more attention than did the Hon.\r\nJames A. McKenzie of Kentucky, the representative from what in\r\nlocal parlance was known as \"the pennyryle district.\"  He was\r\nthe youngest member of the body, tall, erect, and handsome.  Mr.\r\nMcKenzie rendered a valuable service to his constituents and the\r\ncountry during this Congress, by securing the passage of a bill\r\nplacing quinine upon the free list.  His district was seriously\r\nafflicted with the old-time fever and ague, and the reduction by\r\nhis bill to a nominal cost of the sure and only specific placed\r\nhis name high upon the list of benefactors.\r\n\r\nTwo of his kinsmen, one from Illinois, the other from Florida,\r\noccupied seats immediately in his front.  Addressing them one day,\r\nhe said:  \"It seems strange, indeed, that we three cousins--one\r\nfrom Illinois, one from Florida, and one from Kentucky--are all\r\nhere together in Congress\"; and then added, with apparent gravity,\r\n\"and _ours not an office-seeking family either!\"_\r\n\r\nAs the session drew near its close, he made repeated efforts to\r\nobtain unanimous consent for the consideration of a bill for the\r\nerection of a Government building in the principal city of his\r\ndistrict.  The interposition of the stereotyped \"I object\" had,\r\nhowever, in each instance, proved fatal.  During a night session, near\r\nthe close of the Congress, requests for recognition came to the\r\nSpeaker from all parts of the chamber.  In the midst of the tumult\r\nMr. McKenzie arose and, addressing the Chair, stated with great\r\nsolemnity of manner that he arose to a question of personal\r\nprivilege.  This at once arrested the attention of the Speaker,\r\nand he requested the gentleman from Kentucky to state his question\r\nof privilege.  \"I rise, Mr. Speaker,\" said McKenzie, \"to a question\r\nof the _highest_ privilege, one pertaining to the right of a member\r\nto a seat upon this floor--_in the next Congress._  If I don't get\r\nthat post-office bill through now, my seat will be imperilled.\r\nI beg the House for unanimous consent for its immediate consideration.\"\r\nThe House was convulsed; no objection was interposed, the bill was\r\nconsidered and passed, and McKenzie's seat was safe for many years\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nHas there ever been a more feeling two-minutes' speech, than that of\r\nMcKenzie in the National Convention of 1892, when he arose to second\r\nthe nomination of Cleveland?  After a night of intense excitement,\r\nthe convention was still in session at three o'clock in the morning.\r\nA storm was raging without, while within, thousands in the great\r\nhall were impatiently and loudly demanding an immediate vote.  More\r\nthan one of the chief orators of the party,--men well known to the\r\ncountry--had in vain attempted to be heard.  Chaos seemed to\r\nhave come again at the crucial moment that McKenzie, standing upon\r\nhis chair in the centre of the vast enclosure, began:  \"If I speak\r\nlonger than two minutes, I hope that some honest half-drowned\r\nDemocrat will suspend my carcass from one of the cross-beams of\r\nthis highly artistic, but terribly leaky auditorium.  Cleveland\r\nneeds no nomination from this convention.  He has already been\r\nnominated by the people all along the line--all the way from\r\nHell Gate to Yuba Dam!\"\r\n\r\nThe bedlam that now broke loose exceeded all that had gone before.\r\nThe uproar drowned the voice of the orator within, and even, for\r\nthe time, called a halt upon the raging elements without.  The\r\nspeech was never concluded.  What might have been the closing words\r\nof McKenzie's speech, with such a beginning, can never be known.\r\nThe effect of his opening, however, was instantaneous.  It was the\r\nimmediate prelude to the overwhelming nomination of his candidate.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John E. Kenna, of West Virginia, was just at the beginning\r\nof a remarkably brilliant career.  He was under thirty years of\r\nage when he first entered Congress.  At the close of his third term\r\nin the House, he was elected to the United States Senate, and held\r\nhis seat in that body by successive elections until his death at\r\nthe early age of forty-four.  He possessed rare gifts as a speaker,\r\nand was an active participant in many of the important debates\r\nduring that eventful period.  Senator Kenna was the beloved of his\r\nState, and his early death brought sorrow to many hearts.\r\n\r\nHis manners were pleasing, and he was companionable to the last\r\ndegree.  He often related an amusing incident that occurred in the\r\nconvention that first nominated him for Congress.  His name was\r\npresented by a delegate from the Crossroads in one of the mountain\r\ncounties, in substantially the following speech:  \"Mr. President, I\r\nrise to present to this convention, as a candidate for Congress,\r\nthe name of John E. Kenna--the peer, sir, _of no man_ in the State\r\nof West Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the new members elected to this Congress was the Hon. Benjamin\r\nButterworth of Ohio.  His ability as a lawyer and his readiness in\r\ndebate soon gave him prominence, while his abundant good-nature\r\nand inexhaustible fund of anecdotes made him a general favorite in\r\nthe House.  One of his stories was of a Western member whose daily\r\nwalk and conversation at the national Capital was by no means up\r\nto the orthodox home standard.  The better element of his constituents\r\nat length became disgusted, as reports derogatory to their member from\r\ntime to time reached them.  A bolt in the approaching Congressional\r\nconvention was even threatened, and altogether serious trouble was\r\nbrewing.  The demand was imperative upon the part of his closest\r\nfriends that he at once come home and face his accusers.  Homeward\r\nhe at length turned his footsteps, and was met at the depot by a\r\nlarge concourse of his friends and constituents.  Hurriedly alighting\r\nfrom the train and stepping upon the platform, with beaming\r\ncountenance and heart made glad by such an enthusiastic reception,\r\nhe thus began:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, my heart is deeply touched as my eyes behold this\r\nsplendid assemblage of my constituents and friends gathered here\r\nbefore and around me.  During my absence in Congress my friends\r\nhave spoken in my vindication.  I am here now to speak for myself.\r\nVile slanders have been put in circulation against me.  I have been\r\naccused of being a defaulter; I have been accused of being a\r\ndrunkard; I have been accused of being a gambler; but, thank\r\nGod, fellow-citizens, _no man has ever dared to assail my good\r\nmoral character!\"_\r\n\r\nOne incident is related by Butterworth of a judge in his State who,\r\nbecoming thoroughly disgusted with the ease with which naturalization\r\npapers were obtained, determined upon a radical reform.  That\r\nthe pathway of the reformer--along this as other lines--was by\r\nno means one of flowers will appear from the sequel.  Immediately upon\r\ntaking his seat, the judge, with great earnestness of manner,\r\nannounced from the bench that thereafter no applicant could receive\r\nfrom that court his final papers, entitling him to the exercise of\r\nthe high privilege of citizenship, unless he was able to read\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.  A few mornings later,\r\nMichael O'Connor, a well-known partisan of the Seventh Ward, appeared\r\nin court accompanied by a diminutive-looking countryman, Dennis\r\nFlynn by name.  Mr. O'Connor stated to the judge that his friend\r\nDennis Flynn had already taken out his first papers, and the legal\r\ntime had passed, and he now wanted His Honor to grant him his final\r\npapers.  With much solemnity of manner the judge inquired whether\r\nMr. Flynn had ever read the Constitution of the United States.\r\nSomewhat abashed by the unusual interrogatory, Mr. O'Connor looked\r\ninquiringly at Mr. Flynn, at which the latter, wholly unconscious of\r\nthe purport of the inquiry, looked appealingly to Mr. O'Connor.\r\nThe latter then replied that he presumed he had not, at which\r\nthe judge, handing the applicant a copy of the revised statutes\r\ncontaining the Constitution, admonished him to read it carefully.\r\nMr. Flynn, carrying the volume in his arms, and followed by his\r\npatron, sadly left the court-room.  Just eight minutes elapsed,\r\nthe door suddenly opened and both reappeared, Mr. O'Connor in front,\r\nbearing the book aloft, and exclaiming, \"Dinnie couldn't rade it,\r\nYour Honor, but I rid it over to him, _and he is parefictly deloighted\r\nwid it!\"_\r\n\r\nThree gentlemen, each of whom at a later day reached the Speakership,\r\nhad served but a single term in the House at the opening of the\r\nforty-sixth Congress:  Mr. Keifer of Ohio, Mr. Carlisle of Kentucky,\r\nand Mr. Reed of Maine.  Mr. Keifer was a gentleman of ability and of\r\nexceedingly courteous manners.  He took a prominent part in debate,\r\nand was the immediate successor of Mr. Randall in the chair.  After\r\nan absence of twenty years he has again been returned to his seat in\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nFew abler men than Mr. Carlisle have been in the public service.\r\nHe was a recognized leader of his party from his first appearance in\r\nthe House, and an authority upon all questions pertaining to tariff\r\nor finance.  During his long service as Speaker he established\r\nan enduring reputation as an able presiding officer; as possessing\r\nin the highest degree \"the cold neutrality of the impartial Judge.\"\r\nWhile a Senator, he was appointed by President Cleveland to the\r\nimportant position of Secretary of the Treasury.  The duties of\r\nthat great office have never been discharged with more signal\r\nability.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed stood alone.  He was unlike other men, a fact which probably\r\ncaused him little regret.  Self-reliant, aggressive, of will\r\nindomitable, he was a political storm centre during his entire\r\npublic career.  His friends were devoted to him, and he was\r\nnever forgotten by his enemies.  Whoever was brought into close\r\ncontact with him, usually carried away an impression by which to\r\nremember him.  Upon one occasion, in the House, when in sharp debate\r\nwith Mr. Springer, the latter quoted the familiar saying of Henry\r\nClay, \"Sir, I would rather be right than be President.\"  Mr. Reed,\r\nin a tone far from reassuring, retorted, \"The gentleman from Illinois\r\n_will never be either!\"_\r\n\r\nThe retort courteous, however, was not always from the lips of the\r\nSpeaker.  Mr. Springer, having at one time repeatedly attempted,\r\nbut in vain, to secure the floor, at length demanded by what right\r\nhe was denied recognition.  The Speaker intimated that such ruling\r\nwas in accord with the high prerogative of the Chair.  To which\r\nSpringer replied:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, it is excellent\r\n  To have a giant strength; but 't is tyrannous\r\n  To use it like a giant.\"\r\n\r\nOf immense physical proportions, towering above his fellows,\r\nwith voice by no means melodious, a manner far from conciliatory, a\r\ncapacity for sarcastic utterance that vividly recalled the days of\r\nJohn Randolph and Tristram Burgess, and, withal, one of the ablest\r\nmen of his generation, Mr. Reed was in very truth a picturesque\r\nfigure in the House of Representatives.  He apparently acted upon the\r\nsupposition of the philosopher Hobbes that war is the natural state\r\nof man.  The kindly admonition,\r\n\r\n  \"Mend your ways a little\r\n  Lest they may mar your fortunes,\"\r\n\r\nif ever given him, was unheeded.  In very truth,\r\n\r\n  \"He stood,\r\n  As if a man were author of himself,\r\n  And knew no other kin.\"\r\n\r\nNo man in his day was more talked of or written about.  At one time\r\nhis star was in the ascendent, and he seemed to be on the highroad\r\nto the Presidency.  His great ambition, however, was thwarted by\r\nthose of his own political household.  At the close of a turbulent\r\nsession, while he was in the Chair, the usual resolution of thanks\r\nto the Speaker \"for the able, fair, and courteous manner in which he\r\nhad presided\" was bitterly antagonized, and finally adopted only\r\nby a strictly party vote.  It was an event with a single antecedent\r\nin our history, that of seventy-odd years ago, when the Whig minority\r\nin the House opposed the usual vote of thanks to Speaker Polk upon\r\nhis retirement from the Chair.  In the latter case, the cry of\r\npersecution that was instantly raised had much to do with Mr. Polk's\r\nalmost immediate election to the Governorship of his State, and\r\nhis subsequent elevation to the Presidency.  The parallel incident\r\nin Mr. Reed's career, however, failed to prove \"the prologue to\r\nthe swelling act.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. William McKinley, of Ohio, was a member of this Congress.\r\nHe was one of the most pleasing and delightful of associates, and my\r\nacquaintance with him was of the most agreeable character.  One of\r\nhis earliest official acts as President was my appointment as a\r\nmember of the Bimetallic Commission to Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley was in very truth one of Fortune's favorites:  five\r\ntimes elected a member of the House of Representatives, three times\r\nGovernor of his State, and twice elevated to the Presidency.  He\r\nwas the third of our Presidents to fall by the hand of an assassin.\r\nHis tragic death is yet fresh in our memories.\r\n\r\nThe last time I met President McKinley was at the Peace Jubilee\r\nBanquet at the Auditorium in Chicago, on the evening of October\r\n19, 1898.  On this occasion, following the toast to the President of\r\nthe United States, I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The incumbent of this great office holds with unchallenged title the\r\nmost exalted station known to men.  Monarchs rule by hereditary\r\nright, or hold high place only by force of arms.  The elevation of\r\na citizen to the Presidency of the United States is the deliberate\r\nact, under the forms of law, of a sovereign people.  As an aspirant,\r\nhe may have been the choice only of a political party; as the\r\nincumbent of the great office, he is the representative of all the\r\npeople--the President of all the people.  It augurs well for the\r\nfuture of the Republic when the American people magnify this office;\r\nwhen the honor, as now, the President who has so ably upheld its\r\ndignity, so worthily met its solemn responsibilities, so patriotically\r\ndischarged its exacting and imperative duties.\r\n\r\n\"The office of President of a self-governing people is unique.  It\r\nhad no place in ancient or mediaeval schemes of government, whether\r\ndespotic, federative, or in name republican.  It has in reality\r\nnone amongst the nations of modern Europe.  The Presidency of\r\nthe United States, in the highest degree, represents the majesty\r\nof the law.  It stands for the unified authority and power of\r\nseventy-five millions of free men.  It typifies what is most sacred\r\nto our race:  stability in government and protection to liberty\r\nand life.  The President is the great officer to whom the founders of\r\nthe government entrusted the delicate and responsible function of\r\ntreating with foreign States; in whom was vested in time of peace and\r\nof war, chief command of the army and of the navy.\r\n\r\n\"An eminent writer has well said:  'The ancient monarchs of France\r\nreigned and governed; the Queen of England reigns but does not\r\ngovern; the President of France neither reigns nor governs; the\r\nPresident of the United States does not reign, but governs!'\r\n\r\n\"Experience has demonstrated the more than human wisdom of the\r\nframers of the great federal compact which for more than a century,\r\nin peace and amid the stress of war, has held States and people in\r\nindissoluble bond of union.  In no part of their matchless handiwork\r\nhas it been more clearly manifested than in the creation of a\r\nresponsible executive.  To secure in the largest measure the great\r\nends of government, responsibility must attach to the executive\r\noffice; and of necessity, with responsibility, _power._  The sooner\r\nFrance learns from the American Republic this important lesson,\r\nthe sooner will government attain with her the stability to which it\r\nis now a stranger.  Her statesmen might well recall the words of\r\nLord Bacon:  'What men will not alter for the better, Time, the\r\ngreat innovator, will alter for the worse.'\r\n\r\n\"The splendid commonwealth in which we are assembled contains a\r\npopulation a million greater than did the entire country at the\r\nfirst inauguration of President Washington.  The one hundred and\r\nnine years which have passed since that masterful hour in history have\r\nwitnessed the addition of thirty-two States to our federal Union, and\r\nof seventy millions to our population.  And yet, with but few\r\namendments, our great organic law as fully meets the requirements\r\nof a self-governing people to-day as when it came from the hands\r\nof its framers.  The builders of the Constitution wisely ordained the\r\nPresidential office a co-ordinate department of the Government.\r\nMoving in its own clearly defined orbit, without usurpation or\r\nlessening of prerogative, the great executive office, at the close\r\nas at the beginning of the century, is the recognized constitutional\r\nsymbol of authority and of power.  The delegated functions and\r\nprerogatives that pertained in our infancy and weakness have proved\r\nample in the days of our strength and greatness as a nation.\r\n\r\n\"It is well that to the people was entrusted the sovereign power\r\nof choosing their chief magistrate.  It is our glory, in the\r\nretrospect of more than a century, that none other than patriots\r\n--statesmen well equipped for the discharge of its timeless duties\r\n--have ever been chosen to the Presidency.  May we not believe that\r\nthe past is the earnest of the future, and that during the rolling\r\nyears and centuries the incumbents of the great office--the chosen\r\nsuccessors of Washington and of Lincoln--in the near and in the\r\nremote future, will prove the guardians and defenders of the\r\nConstitution, the guardians and defenders of the rights of all the\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n\"Luminous will be the pages of history that tell to the ages the\r\nstory of our recent conflict, of its causes and of its results.\r\nIn brilliancy of achievement, the one hundred days war with Spain is\r\nthe marvel of the closing century.  It was not a war of our seeking.\r\nIt was the earnest prayer of all, from the President to the humblest\r\nin private life, that the horrors of war might be averted.  Had\r\nour ears remained deaf to the cry of the stricken and starving\r\nat our doors, we would not have been guiltless in the high court\r\nof conscience, and before the dread judgment seat of history.  The\r\nplea 'Am I my brother's keeper?'--whether interposed by individual\r\nor by nation--cannot be heard before the august tribunal of the\r\nAlmighty.\r\n\r\n\"Justified then, as we solemnly believe, in the sight of God for\r\nour interposition, we rejoice over the termination of a struggle\r\nin which our arms knew no defeat.  The dead hand of Spain has been\r\nremoved forever from the throats of her helpless victims.  Emphasizing\r\nour solemn declaration as a nation, that this was a war for humanity,\r\nnot for self-aggrandizement, we demand no money indemnity from the\r\ndefeated and impoverished foe.\r\n\r\n\"The sacrifice of treasure and of blood has not been in vain.\r\nHowever it may have been in the past, the United States emerges\r\nfrom the conflict with Spain a united people.  Sectional lines are\r\nforever obliterated.  Henceforth, for all time, we present to\r\nforeign foe and unbroken front.  In the words of Webster:  'Our\r\npolitics go no farther than the water's edge.'\r\n\r\n\"No less important is the fact, that the United States of\r\nAmerica to-day, as never before, commands the respect and admiration\r\nof the world.  No foreign coalition, however formidable, can excite\r\nour serious apprehension or alarm.  For all this, all honor to our\r\nbrave soldiers and sailors; all honor to the helpful hands and\r\nsympathetic hearts of America's patriotic women.\r\n\r\n\"As in the early morning and in the noon of the nineteenth century,\r\nAmerica gave to the world its best lessons in liberty and in\r\nlaw, so in its closing hours, it has given to all the nations a\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten lesson in the dread art of war.  In quick\r\nresponse to the splendid achievements of American valor comes from\r\nacross the sea the startling proposal of despotic Russia for the\r\ndisarmament of continental Europe--and in the end universal peace.\r\n\r\n\"Thankful to God for all he has vouchsafed to us in the past,\r\nand with the prayer that henceforth peace may be the priceless boon\r\nof all nations, we await the dawn of the new century, and turn our\r\nfaces hopefully to the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTHE VICE-PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\nELECTION, POWERS, AND DUTIES OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT--NAMES AND DATES\r\nOF ALL THE VICE-PRESIDENTS--FOUR WHO BECAME PRESIDENTS BY ELECTION\r\n--FIVE WHO SUCCEEDED UPON THE DEATH OF THE PRESIDENT--ATTEMPTS\r\nTO SECURE THE IMPEACHMENTS OF PRESIDENTS--THE TWELFTH AMENDMENT TO\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION--REMARKS ON SOME OF THE VICE-PRESIDENTS--THE\r\nWRITER'S FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of the Federal Constitution, a Vice-President of\r\nthe United States is elected at the same time, for the same term, and\r\nin like manner as the President--by electors chosen in each of the\r\nStates.  A majority of the votes cast in the several electoral\r\ncolleges is necessary to an election.  The Vice-President is the\r\nPresident of the Senate, and in the event of an equal division\r\nin that body, he gives the deciding vote.  Under no other contingency\r\nhas he a vote.  The powers and duties of the office of President\r\ndevolve upon the Vice-President in case of the death, resignation,\r\nor removal from office of the President.  The Vice-President is\r\nincluded in the list of public officers liable to removal from\r\noffice on impeachment, on conviction for treason, bribery, or other\r\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors.  By the twelfth amendment to the\r\nConstitution no person constitutionally ineligible to the office\r\nof President can be elected to that of Vice-President.  In the\r\nevent of a vacancy occurring in the office of Vice-President,\r\nthe Senate is presided over by a member of that body.  In such\r\ncontingency the death of the President would, under existing\r\nlaw, devolve the office of President upon the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven persons have held the office of Vice-President; the\r\ndates of their respective elections are as follows:  John Adams of\r\nMassachusetts, in 1788, re-elected in 1792; Thomas Jefferson of\r\nVirginia, in 1796; Aaron Burr of New York, in 1800; George Clinton\r\nof New York, in 1804, re-elected in 1808; Elbridge Gerry of\r\nMassachusetts, in 1812; Daniel D. Tompkins of New York, in 1816,\r\nre-elected in 1820; John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, in 1824,\r\nre-elected in 1828; Martin Van Buren of New York, in 1832; Richard\r\nM. Johnson of Kentucky, in 1836; John Tyler of Virginia, in\r\n1840; George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania, in 1844; Millard Fillmore of\r\nNew York, in 1848; William R. King of Alabama, in 1852; John C.\r\nBreckenridge of Kentucky, in 1856; Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, in\r\n1860; Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, in 1864; Schuyler Colfax of\r\nIndiana, in 1868; Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, in 1872; William A.\r\nWheeler of New York, in 1876; Chester A. Arthur of New York, in\r\n1880; Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana, in 1884; Levi P. Morton of\r\nNew York, in 1888; Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, in 1892; Garrett\r\nA. Hobart of New Jersey, in 1896; Theodore Roosevelt of New York, in\r\n1900; Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana, in 1904; James S. Sherman\r\nof New York, in 1908.\r\n\r\nFour Vice-Presidents were subsequently elected Presidents, namely:\r\nJohn Adams in 1796; Thomas Jefferson in 1800 and 1804; Martin\r\nVan Buren in 1836; and Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.  The dates given\r\nhave reference to the election by vote of the electors in the\r\nseveral States by whom the President and Vice-President were\r\nsubsequently chosen.  Six Vice-Presidents died in office:  namely,\r\nClinton, Gerry, King, Wilson, Hendricks, and Hobart.  In the\r\nPresidential contest of 1836, Martin Van Buren received a majority\r\nof the electoral votes for President, but no candidate received a\r\nmajority for Vice-President.  By Constitutional requirement the\r\nduty of electing a Vice-President then devolved upon the Senate,\r\nthe candidates from whom such choice was to be made being restricted\r\nto the two who had received the highest number of electoral votes.\r\nOne of these, Richard W. Johnson of Kentucky, was duly elected\r\nby the Senate.  The only Vice-President who resigned the office\r\nwas John C. Calhoun.  This occurred in 1832, and Mr. Calhoun\r\nsoon thereafter took his seat in the Senate, to which body he\r\nhad been elected by the Legislature of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nFive Vice-Presidents have, upon the death of the President, succeeded\r\nto the Presidency.  The first President to die during his incumbency\r\nof the great office, was William Henry Harrison.  His death occurred\r\nApril 4, 1841, just one month after his inauguration.  The\r\nVice-President John Tyler, then at his country home in Virginia, was\r\nofficially notified of the event, and upon reaching the seat of\r\nGovernment at once took the oath of office as President.  There\r\nwas much discussion for a time in and out of Congress as to his\r\nproper title, whether \"Vice-President of the United States acting as\r\nPresident,\" or \"President.\"  The language of the Constitution\r\nhowever, is clear, and it is no longer controverted that upon\r\nthe death of the President the Vice-President becomes, in name\r\nas in fact, President.  Upon the death of President Zachary Taylor,\r\nJuly 9, 1850, Vice-President Millard Fillmore succeeded to the\r\nPresidency, and was at a later date an unsuccessful candidate\r\nfor election to that office.  The third Vice-President who reached\r\nthe Presidency by succession was Andrew Johnson; this occurred\r\nApril 15, 1865, the day following the assassination of President\r\nLincoln.  President Garfield was shot July 2, 1881, and died in\r\nSeptember of that year, when he was succeeded by Vice-President\r\nChester A. Arthur.  Vice-President Roosevelt was the successor\r\nof President McKinley, who died by the hand of an assassin in\r\nSeptember, 1901.\r\n\r\nTwo attempts have been made to secure the impeachment of Presidents,\r\nthe incumbent in each instance having been elected Vice-President and\r\nsucceeded to the higher office upon the death of the President.\r\nA resolution looking to the impeachment of President Tyler was\r\nintroduced into the House of Representatives in January, 1843, but\r\nwas defeated, and no further steps were taken.  Articles of\r\nimpeachment, for \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" were presented by\r\nthe House of Representatives against President Johnson in 1868.\r\nBy constitutional provision the trial was by the Senate, the Chief\r\nJustice of the United States presiding.  Less than two-thirds of\r\nthe Senators voting for conviction, he was acquitted.\r\n\r\nUntil the adoption of the twelfth amendment, no Constitutional\r\nprovision existed for separate votes in the electoral colleges for\r\nPresident and Vice-President; the candidate receiving the highest number\r\nof votes (if a majority of all) became President, and the one\r\nreceiving the second highest, Vice-President.  In 1801, Jefferson and\r\nBurr each received seventy-three electoral votes, and by\r\nconstitutional requirement the election at once devolved upon\r\nthe House of Representatives, voting by States.  On the thirty-sixth\r\nballot a majority of the States voting for Jefferson, he became\r\nPresident, and Burr, Vice-President.  The Constitutional amendment\r\nabove indicated, by which separate ballots were required in the\r\nelectoral colleges for each office, was the result of the\r\nintense excitement throughout the country engendered by this contest.\r\nThe earnest opposition of Alexander Hamilton to Aaron Burr in\r\nthe above-mentioned contest, was the prime cause of the duel by\r\nwhich Hamilton lost his life at the hands of Burr in 1804.\r\n\r\nGeorge Clinton, the fourth Vice-President, had as a member of\r\nthe Continental Congress voted for the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand held the rank of Brigadier-General during the War of the\r\nRevolution.  The fifth Vice-President, Elbridge Gerry, had been\r\na prominent member of the Constitutional Convention of 1787.\r\nWilliam R. King, elected in 1852, by reason of ill health never\r\nentered upon the discharge of the duties of his office.  By special\r\nact of Congress, the oath of office was administered to him in Cuba\r\nand his death occurred soon thereafter.  Of the twenty-seven\r\nVice-Presidents thus far elected, ten have been from the State\r\nof New York.  Adams and Jefferson, the first and second\r\nVice-Presidents, rendered valuable service to the young Republic at\r\nforeign courts; each by election was elevated to the Presidency; and\r\ntheir deaths occurred upon the same historic Fourth of July,\r\njust fifty years from the day they had signed the Declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nA marble bust of each of the Vice-Presidents has been placed in\r\nthe gallery of the Senate Chamber.  The office of Vice-President\r\nis one of great dignity.  He is the presiding officer of the\r\nmost august legislative assembly known to men.  In the event of an\r\nequal division in the Senate, he gives the deciding vote.  This\r\nvote, many times in our history, has been one of deep significance.\r\nIt will readily be seen that the contingency may often occur when the\r\nVice-President becomes an important factor in matters of\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the writer's retirement from office, March 4,\r\n1897, he delivered the following farewell address before the Senate:\r\n\r\n\"Senators:  The hour has arrived which marks the close of the\r\nfifty-fourth Congress, and terminates my official relation to this\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"Before laying down the gavel for the last time, I may be pardoned\r\nfor detaining you for a moment, in the attempt to give expression to\r\nmy gratitude for the uniform courtesy extended me, for the many\r\nkindnesses shown me, during the time it has been my good fortune\r\nto preside over your deliberations.  My appreciation of the Resolution\r\nof the Senate personal to myself, can find no adequate expression in\r\nwords.  Intentionally, I have at no time given offence; and I carry\r\nfrom this presence no shadow of feeling of unkindness toward any\r\nSenator, no memory of any grievance.\r\n\r\n\"Chief among the favors political fortune has bestowed upon me,\r\nI count that of having been the associate--and known something\r\nof the friendship--of the men with whom I have so long held official\r\nrelation in this chamber.  To have been the presiding officer of\r\nthis august body is an honor of which even the most illustrious\r\ncitizen might be proud.  I am persuaded that no occupant of this\r\nChair, during the one hundred and eight years of our Constitutional\r\nhistory, ever entered upon the discharge of the duties pertaining to\r\nthis office more deeply impressed with a sense of the responsibilities\r\nimposed, or with a higher appreciation of the character and dignity\r\nof the great Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\"During the term just closing, questions of deep import to political\r\nparties and to the country have here found earnest and at times\r\npassionate discussion.  This Chamber has indeed been the arena\r\nof great debate.  The record of four years of parliamentary struggles,\r\nof masterful debates, of important legislation, is closed, and\r\npasses now to the domain of history.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can truly say, in the words of a distinguished predecessor,\r\n'In the discharge of my official duties, I have known no cause, no\r\nparty, no friend.'  It has been my earnest endeavor justly to\r\ninterpret, and faithfully to execute, the rules of the Senate.  At\r\ntimes the temptation may be strong to compass partisan ends by a\r\ndisregard or a perversion of the rules.  Yet, I think it safe to\r\nsay, the result, however salutary, will be dearly purchased by a\r\ndeparture from the method prescribed by the Senate for its own\r\nguidance.  A single instance, as indicated, might prove the forerunner\r\nof untold evils.\r\n\r\n  ''T will be recorded for a precedent,\r\n  And many an error by the same example\r\n  Will rush into the State.'\r\n\r\n\"It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this body are\r\nfounded deep in human experience; that they are the result of\r\ncenturies of tireless effort in legislative hall, to conserve,\r\nto render stable and secure, the rights and liberties which have\r\nbeen achieved by conflict.  By its rules, the Senate wisely fixes the\r\nlimits to its own power.  Of those who clamor against the Senate\r\nand its mode of procedure it may be truly said, 'They know not what\r\nthey do.'  In this Chamber alone are preserved, without restraint,\r\ntwo essentials of wise legislation and of good government--the\r\nright of amendment and of debate.  Great evils often result from\r\nhasty legislation, rarely from the delay which follows full\r\ndiscussion and deliberation.  In my humble judgment, the historic\r\nSenate, preserving the unrestricted right of amendment and of\r\ndebate, maintaining intact the time-honored parliamentary methods and\r\namenities which unfailingly secure action after deliberation,\r\npossesses in our scheme of government a value which can not be\r\nmeasured by words.  The Senate is a perpetual body.  In the\r\nterse words of an eminent Senator now present:  'The men who framed\r\nthe Constitution had studied thoroughly all former attempts at\r\nRepublican government.  History was strewn with the wrecks of\r\nunsuccessful democracies.  Sometimes the usurpation of the executive\r\npower, sometimes the fickleness and unbridled license of the people,\r\nhad brought popular governments to destruction.  To guard against these\r\ndangers, they placed their chief hope in the Senate.  The Senate\r\nwhich was organized in 1789, at the inauguration of the Government,\r\nabides and will continue to abide, one and the same body, until\r\nthe Republic itself shall be overthrown, or time shall be no more.'\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-four Senators who have occupied seats in this Chamber during\r\nmy term of office are no longer members of this body.  Five of that\r\nnumber--Stanford, Colquitt, Vance, Stockbridge, and Wilson--\r\n'shattered with the contentions of the Great Hall,' full of years and\r\nof honors have passed from earthly scenes.  The fall of the\r\ngavel will conclude the long and honorable terms of service of\r\nother Senators, who will be borne in kind remembrance by their\r\nassociates who remain.\r\n\r\n\"I would do violence to my feelings if I failed to express my thanks\r\nto the officers of this body for the fidelity with which they have\r\ndischarged their important duties, and for the kindly assistance\r\nand unfailing courtesy of which I have been the recipient.\r\n\r\n\"For the able and distinguished gentleman who succeeds me as\r\nyour presiding officer, I earnestly invoke the same co-operation\r\nand courtesy which you have so generously accorded me.\r\n\r\n\"Senators, my parting words have been spoken, and I now discharge my\r\nlast official duty, that of declaring the Senate adjourned without\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nTHE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY OF FORMULATING A FEDERAL CONSTITUTION--THE CONVENTION\r\nOF 1787 SEES THE NECESSITY FOR A GENERAL GOVERNMENT WITH PLENARY\r\nPOWERS--JEALOUSY OF THE SMALLER TOWARD THE LARGER STATES--\r\nBRITISH PARLIAMENT TAKEN, WITH QUALIFICATIONS, AS THE MODEL FOR THE\r\nHOUSES OF CONGRESS--EQUAL STATE REPRESENTATION IN THE SENATE--\r\nNON-EXISTENCE OF ANY METHOD FOR TERMINATING DEBATES IN THE SENATE--\r\nPOTENCY OF THE PRESIDENT'S VETO--ABUSE OF THE _CLOTURE_ IN THE\r\nHOUSE--PROCEDURE IN THE EVENT OF THE FAILURE OF THE PEOPLE TO ELECT\r\nA PRESIDENT OR A VICE-PRESIDENT--THE HAYES-TILDEN CONTEST--DANGER OF\r\nUSURPATION OF POWER BY THE EXECUTIVE--THE SENATE AS A HIGH COURT\r\nOF IMPEACHMENT--TRIAL OF CHASE OF MARYLAND--TRIAL OF BELKNAP,\r\nSECRETARY OF WAR--TRIAL OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact in our political history that the convention\r\nwhich formulated our Federal Constitution greatly exceeded the\r\npowers delegated to its members by their respective States.  It\r\nwas the supreme moment, and upon the action of the historic assemblage\r\ndepended events of far-reaching consequence.  The Constitution\r\nof the United States is the enduring monument to the courage, the\r\nforecast, the wisdom of the members of the Convention of 1787.  It\r\nwas theirs to cut the Gordian knot, to break with the past, and,\r\nregardless of the jealousies and antagonisms of individual States,\r\nto establish the more perfect union, which has been declared by an\r\neminent British statesman \"the greatest work ever struck off at\r\na given time from the brain and purpose of man.\"\r\n\r\nThe oft-quoted expression of Gladstone is, however, more rhetorical\r\nthan accurate.  The Constitution of the United States was not\r\n\"struck off at a given time,\" but as declared by Bancroft, \"the\r\nmaterials for its building were the gifts of the ages.\"  In the\r\nwords of Lieber, \"What the ancients said of the avenging gods, that\r\nthey were shod with wool, is true of great ideas in government.\r\nThey approach slowly.  Great truths dwell a long time with small\r\nminorities.\"\r\n\r\nThe period following the treaty of peace with Great Britain in\r\n1783, which terminated the War of the Revolution, has been not\r\ninaptly designated \"the critical period of American history.\"  The\r\nRevolutionary Government, under which Washington had been chosen\r\nto the chief command of the colonial forces, the early battles\r\nfought, and the Declaration of Independence promulgated, had\r\nbeen superseded in 1781 by a Government created under the Articles\r\nof Confederation.  The latter Government, while in a vital sense\r\na mere rope of sand, was a long step in the right direction; the\r\nearnest of the more perfect union yet to follow.\r\n\r\nUnder the Government, more shadowy than real, thus created, the\r\nclosing battles of the Revolution were fought, independence achieved,\r\na treaty of peace concluded, and our recognition as a sovereign\r\nRepublic obtained from our late antagonist and other European\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation, submitted for ratification by the\r\nColonial Congress to the individual States while the country was\r\nyet in the throes of a doubtful struggle, fell far short of\r\nestablishing what in even crude form could properly be designated a\r\nGovernment.  The Confederation was wholly lacking in one essential\r\nof all Governments:  the power to execute its own decrees.  Its\r\navowed purpose was to establish \"a firm league of friendship,\" or,\r\nas the name indicates, a mere confederation of the colonies.\r\nThe parties to this league were independent political communities,\r\nand by express terms, each State was to retain all rights, sovereignty,\r\nand jurisdiction not expressly delegated to the Confederation.  In\r\na Congress consisting of a single House were vested the powers thus\r\ngrudgingly conferred.  Its members were to be chosen by the States\r\nas such; upon every question the vote was given by States, each,\r\nregardless of population, having but a single vote.  The revenues and\r\nthe regulation of foreign commerce were to remain under the control\r\nof the respective States, and no provision was made for borrowing\r\nmoney for the necessary maintenance of the general Government.  In\r\na word, in so far as a Government at all, it was in the main one\r\nof independent States, and in no sense that with which we are\r\nfamiliar, a Government of the entire people.  Whatever existed\r\nof executive power was in a committee of the Congress; the only\r\nprovision for meeting the expenses of the late war and the interest\r\nupon the public debt was by requisition upon the States, with no\r\nshadow of power for its enforcement.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions briefly mentioned, with the United States\r\nof America a byword among the nations, the now historic Convention\r\nof 1787 assembled in Philadelphia, in the room where eleven\r\nyears earlier had been promulgated the Declaration of Independence.\r\nIt consisted of fifty-five members; and without a dissenting voice,\r\nWashington, a delegate from Virginia, was elected its President.\r\nNot the least of his public services was now to be rendered in the\r\nwork of safeguarding the fruits of successful revolution by a stable\r\nGovernment.  Chief among the associates with whom he was daily\r\nin earnest, anxious counsel in the great assemblage, were men whose\r\nnames live with his in history.  If Franklin, Wilson, Sherman,\r\nKing, Randolph, Rutledge, Mason, Pinckney, Hamilton, Madison,\r\nand their associates had rendered no public service other than\r\nas builders of the Constitution, that alone would entitle them\r\nto the measureless gratitude of all future generations of their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nWhen they were assembled, the startling fact was at once apparent that,\r\nunder the Confederation, with its constituent States at times in\r\nalmost open hostility to one another, the country was gradually\r\ndrifting into a condition of anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is our glory to-day, and will be that of countless on-coming\r\ngenerations, that the men of '87 were equal to the stupendous\r\nemergency.  Regardless of instructions, expressed or implied,\r\nthe master spirits of the Convention, looking beyond local prejudices\r\nand State environment, and appealing to time for vindication, with\r\na ken that now seems more than human, discerned the safety, the\r\nwell-being, the glory of their countrymen, bound up in a general\r\nGovernment of plenary powers, a Government \"without a seam in its\r\ngarment, to foreign nations.\"\r\n\r\nTo this end the proposition submitted by Paterson of New Jersey,\r\nin the early sittings of the Convention, for a mere enlargement of\r\nthe powers of the Confederation, was decisively rejected.  With\r\nthe light that could be gleaned from the pages of Montesquieu, the\r\nsuggestive lessons to be drawn from the fate of the short-lived\r\nrepublics whose wrecks lay along the pathway of history, and from the\r\nunwritten Constitution of the mother country, as their only guides,\r\nthe leaders of the Convention were at once in the difficult role\r\nof constructive statesmen.  The Herculean task to which with\r\nunwearied effort they now addressed themselves was that of \"builders\"\r\nof the Constitution; the establishers, for the ages, of the\r\nfundamental law for a free people.\r\n\r\nOne of the perils which early beset the Convention, and whose\r\nspectre haunted its deliberations till the close, was the hostility\r\nengendered by the dread and jealousy of the smaller toward the\r\nlarger States.  This fact will in some measure explain what in\r\nlater years have been denominated the anomalies of the Constitution.\r\nTo a correct understanding of the motives of the builders, and\r\nan appreciation of their marvellous accomplishment, it must not be\r\nforgotten that \"The foundations of the Constitution were laid in\r\ncompromise.\"  The men of '87 had but recently emerged from the\r\nbloody conflict through which they had escaped the domination of\r\nkingly power.  With the tyranny of George the Third yet burning in\r\ntheir memories, it is not to be wondered that the Revolutionary\r\npatriots of the less populous States were loath to surrender rights,\r\ndeemed, by them, secure under their local governments; that they\r\ndreaded the establishment of what they apprehended might prove\r\nan overshadowing--possibly unlimited--central authority.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a general Government, with its three separate\r\nand measurably independent departments, happily concluded, with\r\nthe delegated powers of each distinctly enumerated, the salient\r\nquestion as to the basis of representation in the Congress at once\r\npressed for determination.  Upon the question of provision for a\r\nchief executive, and his investment with the powers necessarily\r\nincident to the great office, there was after much debate a practical\r\nconsensus of opinion.  And practical unanimity in the end prevailed\r\nregarding the judicial department, with its great court without\r\na prototype at its creation, and even yet without a counterpart in\r\nforeign Governments.\r\n\r\nThe rock upon which the Convention barely escaped early dissolution,\r\nwas the basis of representation in the Congress created under\r\nthe great co-ordinate legislative department.  The model for our\r\nSenate and House of Representatives was unquestionably the British\r\nParliament.  This statement is to be taken with weighty qualifications;\r\nfor hereditary or ecclesiastical representation, as in the House\r\nof Lords, is wholly unknown in our system of government.  The\r\nsignificant resemblance is that of our Lower House to the\r\nBritish Commons.  In these respective chambers, the people, as\r\nsuch, have representation.\r\n\r\nThe earnest, at times violent, contention of the smaller States,\r\nin our historic Convention, was for equal representation in both\r\nbranches of the proposed national legislature.  This was strenuously\r\nresisted by the larger States under the powerful leadership of\r\nMadison of Virginia, and Wilson of Pennsylvania.  Their equally\r\nearnest, and by no means illogical contention was for popular\r\nrepresentation in each House, as outlined in the Virginia plan\r\nwhich had been taken as the framework of the proposed Constitution.\r\nThe opposing views appeared wholly irreconcilable, and for a time the\r\nparting of the ways seemed to have been reached.  Threats of\r\ndissolution were not uncommon in the Chamber, and for many days\r\nthe spirit of despair brooded over the Convention.  A delegate from\r\nMaryland vehemently declared:  \"The Convention is on the verge\r\nof dissolution, scarcely held together by the strength of a hair.\"\r\nWell has it been said:  \"In even the contemplation of the fearful\r\nconsequence of such a calamity, the imagination stands aghast.\"\r\n\r\nAt the crucial moment mentioned, Sherman and Ellsworth presented\r\nupon behalf of Connecticut the first and most far-reaching of\r\nthe great compromises of the Constitution.  The Connecticut plan\r\nwas in brief to the effect that in fixing the ratio of representation\r\nthere should be recognition alike of the federal and of the national\r\nfeature in government, in a word, that in the Lower House the\r\nnational, and in the upper the federal principle should have\r\nfull recognition.  This was a departure from the Virginia plan\r\nto the extent that it in effect proposed the establishment of a\r\nfederal republic,--in the concrete, that the House should be composed\r\nof representatives chosen directly by the people from districts of\r\nequal population; while representation in the Senate should be that\r\nof the States, each, regardless of population, to have two members,\r\nto be chosen at stated periods by their respective legislatures.\r\n\r\nAfter heated debate, this compromise was carried by a bare majority,\r\nand the provision for popular representation in the House, and\r\nequal State representation in the Senate, became engrafted upon\r\nour Federal Constitution.  This feature, an eminent foreign writer has\r\ndeclared, \"is the chief American contribution to the common treasures\r\nof political civilization.\"  The eminent writer, De Tocqueville,\r\nhas well said:  \"The principle of the independence of the States\r\ntriumphed in the formation of the Senate, and that of the sovereignty\r\nof the nation in the composition of the House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\nThe success of the Connecticut plan made possible that of other\r\nessential compromises which followed; and the result was, as the\r\nsublime consummation of wise deliberation and patriotic concession,\r\nthe establishment of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is the proud boast of the Briton, that \"the British Constitution\r\nhas no single date from which its duration is to be reckoned,\r\nand that the origin of English law is as undiscoverable as that of\r\nthe Nile.\"  Our Government, buttressed upon a written Constitution\r\nof enumerated and logically implied powers, had its historic\r\nbeginning upon that masterful day, April 30, 1789, when Washington\r\ntook solemn oath of office as our first President.\r\n\r\nThe Senate of the United States has been truly declared \"the greatest\r\ndeliberative body known to men.\"  By Constitutional provision it\r\nconsists of two members from each State, chosen by the Legislature\r\nthereof, for the term of six years.  No person has the legal\r\nqualification for Senator \"unless he shall have attained the age\r\nof thirty years, be an inhabitant of the State for which he is\r\nchosen, and have been nine years a citizen of the United States.\"\r\nNo State, without its consent, can ever be deprived, even by\r\nConstitutional amendment, of its equal representation in the Senate.\r\nNevada with a population of less than forty thousand has her equal\r\nvoice with New York with a population exceeding seven million.\r\nThis anomaly was occasioned by concession by the larger to the\r\nsmaller States in the Convention of 1787, a concession which\r\nmade possible the establishment of the federal Union.\r\n\r\nOne essential difference between the House of Representatives\r\nand the Senate is that to the latter \"the previous question\" is\r\nunknown; no method existing for terminating debate, other than\r\nby unanimous consent.  Here, unlimited discussion and amendment\r\ncan have their perfect work.  Within the last three or four decades\r\nmany fruitless attempts have been made to introduce a modified\r\n\"previous question\" or _cloture,_ by which the Senate could be\r\nbrought to an immediate vote.  At first blush such change might\r\nseem desirable, but experience has demonstrated the wisdom of\r\nthe method to which there has been such steady adherence.  It\r\nsecures time for consideration and full discussion upon every\r\nquestion.  In the end the vote will be taken.  Debate is rarely\r\nprolonged beyond reasonable limit.  Not infrequently the public\r\nwelfare is imperilled by too much, rather than too little, legislation.\r\nIt was the belief of Jefferson that government should touch the\r\ncitizen at the fewest possible points.  The quaint lines of the\r\nold English poet have lost nothing of their significance:\r\n\r\n  \"How small, of all that human hearts endure,\r\n  That part which laws or kings can cause or cure!\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives has in large degree ceased to be a\r\ndeliberative body.  Under the iron rule of the \"previous question\"\r\nmeasures of importance are hurriedly passed without the possibility\r\nof discussion or amendment.  The rights of the minority are at\r\ntimes but as the dust in the balance.\r\n\r\nUnlike the House of Lords, the Senate is in reality an important\r\nfactor in legislation.  As is well known in recent years, government\r\nin Great Britain is virtually that of the House of Commons, in\r\nlarge measure through a cabinet practically of its own appointment.\r\nThe King is little more than a ceremonial figure-head, and the\r\nHouse of Lords is almost in a death struggle for existence.  The\r\nend would probably come by serious attempt upon its part to thwart\r\nthe popular will as expressed through the House of Commons.  The\r\npower of Edward the Seventh is but a shadow of that exercised almost\r\nwithout let or hindrance by the predecessors of Queen Victoria.\r\nThe veto power, so potent an instrumentality in the hands of the\r\nAmerican President, is to all intents a dead letter in the mythical\r\nBritish Constitution.  For a century and a half it has remained in\r\npractical abeyance.  It is believed that its attempted exercise at\r\nthis day would produce revolution; possibly endanger the existence\r\nof the throne.\r\n\r\nBy means of what is known as a suspension of the rules, under\r\nthe operation of the \"previous question,\" much important legislation\r\nis enacted in our House of Representatives, without the minority\r\nhaving the privilege of debate, or amendment, or even the necessary\r\ntime to a full understanding of the pending measure.  The constantly\r\nrecurring \"River and Harbor Bill,\" with its enormous sum total\r\nof appropriations, is a striking object lesson of the vicious\r\ncharacter of such methods.\r\n\r\nIn the light of what has been suggested, the wisdom displayed in\r\nthe establishment of the bicameral, or two-chamber system, in\r\nour legislative scheme, is strikingly apparent.  At the time of\r\nits creation, it had no counterpart in any of the Governments of\r\ncontinental Europe.  Its only prototype, in so far as it was such,\r\nwas the British House of Lords as already indicated.\r\n\r\nSave only in the right to originate revenue bills, the power of\r\nthe Senate is concurrent with that of the House in all matters\r\nof legislation; and these are wisely subject to amendment by the\r\nSenate.  The presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice-President\r\nof the United States, and in his absence a Senator chosen as\r\nPresident _pro tempore._\r\n\r\nIn the event of a failure on the part of the people to elect a\r\nPresident or a Vice-President of the United States, through electors\r\nduly appointed at the stated time, the duty of such election devolves\r\nupon the House and the Senate acting independently of each other.\r\nThe choice of President is limited to the three candidates who have\r\nreceived the highest number of votes in the several electoral\r\ncolleges.  The determination is by the House of Representatives,\r\nthe vote being by States.  In such event the vote of Nevada\r\nwould again count equally with that of New York.  In the contingency\r\nmentioned, of a failure to elect a Vice-President, the election\r\ndevolves upon the Senate, each Senator having a personal vote; and\r\nthe person chosen must by Constitutional requirement be one of the\r\ntwo receiving the highest number of electoral votes.  In 1836, Mr.\r\nVan Buren of New York received a majority of the electoral votes\r\nfor President; but no person receiving a majority for the second\r\noffice, Colonel Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, one of the two\r\npersons eligible, was chosen by the Senate.  No similar instance\r\nhas occurred in our history.\r\n\r\nIn the Presidential election of 1800, and in that of 1824, the\r\nultimate determination was by the House of Representatives.  In\r\nthe former, Jefferson and Burr each received seventy-three electoral\r\nvotes, without specification as to whether intended for the first or\r\nsecond office.  The protracted struggle which followed resulted in\r\nthe choice of Jefferson for the higher office.  This fortunate\r\ntermination was in large measure through the influence of Alexander\r\nHamilton, and was the initial step in the bitter personal strife\r\nwhich eventuated in his early death at the hands of Burr.  In\r\nthe light of events, we may well believe that not the least of the\r\npublic services of Hamilton was his unselfish interposition at the\r\ncritical moment mentioned.  The possibility of similar complication\r\nagain arising in the election of the President was soon thereafter\r\nobviated by the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSeldom in Presidential contests has there been such an array of\r\ngreat names presented as in that of 1824.  The era of good feeling\r\nwhich characterized the administration of Monroe found sudden\r\ntermination in the rival candidacy of two members of his cabinet, for\r\nthe succession--Mr. Adams, Secretary of State, and Mr. Crawford, of\r\nthe Treasury.  The other aspirants were Clay, the brilliant Speaker\r\nof the House of Representatives, and Jackson, with laurels yet\r\nfresh from the battlefield of New Orleans.  Mr. Clay receiving the\r\nsmallest number of electoral votes, and no candidate the\r\nmajority thereof, the selection again devolved upon the House,\r\nresulting eventually in the choice of John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\nIn the two Presidential contests last mentioned, the Senate had no\r\npart in the final adjustment.  An occasion, however, arose nearly a\r\nhalf-century later, involving the succession to the Presidency, in\r\nwhich the Senate, equally with the House, was an important factor in\r\nthe final determination.  The country has known few periods of\r\nprofounder anxiety to thoughtful men, or of greater peril to stable\r\ngovernment, than the feverish hours immediately succeeding the\r\nPresidential contest of 1876.  The shadow cast by the Hayes-Tilden\r\ncontest even yet, in a measure, lingers.  As a Representative in\r\nCongress at the time, I was deeply impressed with the gravity of\r\nthe situation.  In the instances first mentioned it was the mere\r\nquestion of the failure of any candidate to receive a majority\r\nof the electoral votes.  The framers of the Constitution had wisely\r\nprovided for such contingency by action of the House in manner\r\nindicated.  The far more serious question now confronting was, For\r\nwhom had the disputed States of Florida and Louisiana cast their\r\nvotes?  The settlement of this question virtually determined which\r\ncandidate should be inaugurated President.  Conflicting certificates\r\nfrom the States named had been forwarded to the seat of government,\r\nand were in keeping of the officer designated by law as the custodian\r\nof the electoral returns from the several States.  The contingency\r\nwhich had now arisen was one for which there was no provision.\r\nThe sole function of the joint session of the Senate and the House\r\nwas \"to open all the certificates and count the votes.\"  This\r\nwas \"the be all and end all\" of its authority.  Upon the arising\r\nof any question demanding a vote, or even deliberation, the members\r\nof the joint session could only return to their separate chambers.\r\nThey could act only in their separate capacities.  In a word,\r\nthe perilous exigency presented was, the friends of one candidate having\r\na majority in the Senate, and of the other in control of the House;\r\nconflicting certificates presented, upon which hinged the result, and\r\nthe tension throughout the entire country assuming alarming\r\nproportions.  Coupled with the question of peaceable succession to\r\nthe great office was that of the durability of popular government.\r\nTremendous issues, upon which depended unfathomable consequences, pressed\r\nfor settlement; and no tribunal was in existence for their\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nThe sober second thought of those upon whom was then cast the\r\nresponsibility asserted itself at the opportune moment, and a\r\ncommission consisting of an equal number of Senators, Representatives,\r\nand Judges of the Great Court was created.  This commission--\r\nextra-Constitutional, as was believed by many--decided as to the\r\nvalidity of the conflicting certificates, and in effect determined\r\nas to the Presidential succession.\r\n\r\nThe justification of the act creating the commission might well\r\nrest upon the fact that an overshadowing emergency had arisen,\r\nwhere necessity becomes the paramount law.  \"The pendulum of history\r\nswings in centuries,\" and a single term of the great office weighed\r\nlittle in view of the perils that surely awaited a failure to secure\r\npeaceful adjustment.\r\n\r\nI may be pardoned for adding that in the retrospect of a life,\r\nno longer a short one, I have no regrets that my humble voice\r\nand vote were given for peaceable and lawful adjustment of a perilous\r\ncontroversy, that cast its dark shadow across our national pathway\r\n--such a one, as, please God, our country may never witness again.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the least satisfactory of the devices of our Federal\r\nConstitution is that for the election of President and Vice-President\r\nthrough the instrumentality of colleges of electors chosen by\r\nthe several States.  Upon this subject notes of warning have\r\nbeen many times sounded by eminent statesmen of the past.  In view\r\nof the hazardous complications through which we have happily passed,\r\nand of those which may possibly beset our future pathway as a\r\nnation, it would indeed be the part of wisdom, if by Constitutional\r\namendment a less complicated and cumbrous instrumentality could be\r\ndevised for ascertaining and making effective the popular will\r\nin the selection of President and Vice-President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOne of the apprehensions of the framers of the Constitution was\r\nthat of executive usurpation of functions lawfully pertaining to\r\nthe co-ordinate department of the Government.  This was measurably\r\nguarded against by the provision requiring appointment to high\r\noffice to be by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\nWhile the President by the exercise of the veto power possesses\r\na negative upon legislation, the Senate by virtue of the provision\r\nquoted has an equally effective negative upon executive appointments\r\nto important office.\r\n\r\nTo the President is confided primarily the treaty-making power.\r\nTreaties are the law of the land, and their observance in spirit\r\nas well as letter touches the national honor.  Upon this often\r\ndepends the issue of peace or war.  Before becoming effective their\r\nratification by a two-thirds vote of the Senate is indispensable.\r\nFrom these and other safeguards strikingly appear what are known\r\nas \"the checks and balances\" of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAn important function of the Senate yet to be mentioned is that of\r\nsitting as a high court of impeachment.  The President, Vice-President,\r\nand other high officials are amenable to its jurisdiction.  The\r\ninitial step, however, in such procedure is by the House of\r\nRepresentatives, as the grand inquest of the nation, presenting\r\narticles of impeachment, the Senate possessing the sole power of\r\ntrial.  Six times only in our history has the Senate been resolved\r\ninto a Court of Impeachment, and only twice--in the case of district\r\njudges--has there been a conviction.  The earliest trial, more than\r\na century ago, was that of a supreme justice, Chase of Maryland.\r\nApart from the high official position of the accused, and the august\r\ntribunal before which he was arraigned, this trial is of\r\nhistoric interest from the fact that it involved the once famous\r\nAlien and Sedition Laws; that John Randolph was chief of the managers\r\non the part of the House; Pinckney, Martin, and William Wirt of\r\ncounsel for the defence; and Vice-President Aaron Burr, the presiding\r\nofficer of the court.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Belknap, Secretary of War, is still within the memory\r\nof many.  As a member of the House, I attended it from the beginning.\r\nIt appearing from the evidence that Belknap had resigned his office\r\nbefore the presentation of the articles of impeachment, he was\r\nacquitted.  The fate of General Belknap was indeed a sad one, that\r\nof a hitherto honorable career suddenly terminated under a cloud.\r\nMorally guiltless himself, his chivalric assumption of responsibility\r\nfor the act of one near to him, and his patiently abiding the\r\nconsequence, has invested with something of pathos, and even romance,\r\nthe memory of his trial.\r\n\r\nAn impeachment that has left its deep impress upon history, and\r\nbefore which all others pale into insignificance, was that of\r\nPresident Johnson, charged by the House of Representatives with\r\nthe commission of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"  He had been\r\nelected to the second place upon the ticket with Mr. Lincoln in\r\n1864, and upon the death of the latter, succeeded to the Presidency.\r\nRadical differences with the majority in the Congress, upon questions\r\nvital and far-reaching, ultimately culminated in the presentation of\r\narticles of impeachment.  Partisan feeling was at its height,\r\nand the excitement throughout the country intense.  The trial\r\nwas protracted for many weeks without jot or tittle of abatement\r\nin the public interest.  The chief managers on the part of the\r\nHouse were Benjamin F. Butler and Thaddeus Stevens.  The array\r\nof counsel for the accused included the names of Benjamin R. Curtis,\r\nHenry Stanberry, and William M. Evarts.  The Senate, in its high\r\ncharacter of a court, was presided over for the first and only time\r\nby the Chief Justice of the United States.  The trial was conducted\r\nwith marked decorum; every phase of questions touching the exercise\r\nof executive authority, or lawful discretion, was fully discussed,\r\nthe very springs of legislative power, and its limitation under\r\nConstitutional government, were laid bare--all with an eloquence\r\nunparalleled save only in the wondrous efforts of Sheridan, Fox,\r\nand Burke in the historic impeachment of Warren Hastings before\r\nthe British House of Lords.  The spectacle presented was one\r\nthat challenged the attention and wonder of the nations; that of\r\nthe chief magistrate of a great republic at the bar of justice,\r\ncalmly awaiting judgment without popular disturbance or attempted revolt,\r\nunder the safeguards of law and its appointments.  The highest test\r\nof the virtue of our system of representative government, and of\r\nthe unfaltering devotion of our people to its prescribed methods, is\r\nto be found in the fact, that during the protracted trial the\r\nvarious departments proceeded with wonted regularity; the verdict of\r\nthe Senate was acquiesced in without manifestation of hostility;\r\npartisan passion soon abated and the great impeachment peaceably\r\nrelegated to the domain of history.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives has an official life of short duration.\r\nIts reorganization is biennial.  The Senate is enduring.  Always\r\norganized, it is the continuing body of our national legislature.\r\nIts members change, but the Senate continues the same now, as in\r\nthe first hour of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn his last great speech in the Senate, Mr. Webster said:\r\n\r\n\"It is fortunate that there is a Senate of the United States; a\r\nbody not yet moved from its propriety, not lost to a full sense of\r\nits own dignity and its own high responsibilities, and a body to\r\nwhich the country looks with confidence for wise, moderate, patriotic,\r\nand healing counsels.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the first assembling of the Senate in its present magnificent\r\nchamber nearly half a century ago, the Vice-President closed his\r\neloquent dedicatory address with the words:\r\n\r\n\"Though these marble walls moulder into ruins, the Senate in another\r\nage may bear into a new and larger chamber the Constitution vigorous\r\nand inviolate, and the last generation of posterity shall witness the\r\ndeliberations of the representatives of American States still\r\nunited, prosperous, and free.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nA TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN\r\n\r\nTHE WRITER'S SPEECH AT THE LINCOLN CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION, 1909\r\n--PATRIOTIC CHARACTER OF THE MEETING--LEADING HISTORICAL EVENTS\r\nBETWEEN 1809 AND 1909--BIRTH OF LINCOLN--TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION OF\r\nILLINOIS--BIRTH OF DARWIN AND GLADSTONE--CAREER OF NAPOLEON--WAR\r\nOF 1812--THE SLAVERY QUESTION--SEIZURE AND SURRENDER OF MASON\r\nAND SLIDELL--EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12, 1909, will long be remembered as the day of the\r\ncelebration of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Abraham\r\nLincoln.  For on that day was the culmination of a celebration\r\nwhich, in various parts of the country, had begun at least a\r\nweek before.  Rarely has there been an occasion of so much decoration,\r\nso many addresses, or so much patriotism.  The largest celebration\r\noccurred in New York City, but that of Chicago, if not so large,\r\nwas at least as interesting and impressive, for in it and surrounding\r\nparts of Illinois some of the most memorable events in the life of\r\nLincoln took place.  Yet these manifestations were not a whit more\r\npatriotic than those of many small towns and villages.\r\n\r\nEvery hamlet, every town, and every city of the United States seemed\r\nto be imbued with a desire to do honor to the memory of the man\r\nLincoln.  Every newspaper and every magazine of whatever name or\r\norder was filled with pictures, anecdotes, and sketches of the life\r\nof \"Honest Abe.\"  Books galore were published emphasizing every\r\nphase of his life, character, work, and influence; and they sold\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nMy contribution to this occasion was the following speech delivered\r\nat Bloomington, Illinois, February 12:\r\n\r\n\"We have assembled to commemorate one of the epoch-making events\r\nin history.  In the humblest of homes in the wilds of a new and\r\nsparsely settled State, Abraham Lincoln was born one hundred years\r\nago, this day.\r\n\r\n\"The twelfth day of February, like the twenty-second day of the\r\nsame month, is one of the sacred days in the American calendar.\r\nIt is well that this day be set apart from ordinary uses, the\r\nheadlong rush in the crowded mart suspended, the voice of fierce\r\ncontention in legislative halls be hushed, and that the American\r\npeople--whether at home, in foreign lands, or upon the deep--honor\r\nthemselves by honoring the memory of the man of whose birth this\r\nday is the first centennial.\r\n\r\n\"This coming together is no idle ceremony, no unmeaning observance.\r\nTo this man, more than to any other, are we indebted for the supreme\r\nfact that ninety millions of people are at this hour, in the loftiest\r\nsense of the expression, fellow-citizens of a common country.  Some\r\nof us, through the mists of half a century, distinctly recall\r\nthe earnest tones in which Mr. Lincoln in public speech uttered\r\nthe words, 'My fellow-citizens.'  Truly the magical words\r\n'fellow-citizens' never fail to touch a responsive chord in the\r\npatriotic heart.  Was it the gifted Prentiss who at a critical\r\nmoment of our history exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"'For whether upon the Sabine or the St. John's; standing in\r\nthe shadow of Bunker Hill or amid the ruins of Jamestown; near\r\nthe great northern lakes or within the sound of the Father of\r\nWaters flowing unvexed to the sea; in the crowded mart of the\r\ngreat metropolis or upon the western verge of the continent,\r\nwhere the restless tide of emigration is stayed only by the\r\nocean--everywhere upon this broad domain, thank God, I can still\r\nsay \"fellow-citizens\"!'\r\n\r\n\"Let us pause for a moment and briefly note some of the marvellous\r\nresults wrought out by the toil, strife, and sacrifice of the\r\ncentury whose close we commemorate.  The Year of Our Lord 1809 was\r\none of large place in history.  The author of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was upon the eve of final retirement from public place,\r\nand the Presidential term of James Madison just beginning, when in\r\na log cabin near the western verge of civilization the eyes of\r\nAbraham Lincoln first opened upon the world.  The vast area\r\nstretching from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean was under\r\nthe dominion of Spain.  Two decades only had passed since the\r\nestablishment of the United States Government under the Federal\r\nConstitution, and the inauguration of Washington as its first\r\nPresident.  Lewis and Clark had but recently returned from the now\r\nhistoric expedition to the Columbia and the Oregon,--an expedition\r\nfraught with momentous consequences to the oncoming generations of\r\nthe Republic.  Only five years had passed since President Jefferson\r\nhad purchased, for fifteen millions of dollars from Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, the Louisiana country, extending from the Gulf of Mexico\r\nto the frozen lakes, out of which were to be carved sixteen\r\nmagnificent States to become enduring parts of the American\r\nRepublic.  From the early Colonial settlements that fringed the\r\nAtlantic, a tide of hardy emigration was setting in to the westward,\r\nand, regardless of privation or danger, laying the sure foundation\r\nof future commonwealths.  Four States only had been admitted into the\r\nFederal Union, and the population of the entire country was less\r\nthan that of the State of New York to-day.  This same year witnessed\r\nthe first organization of Illinois into a distinct political\r\ncommunity and its creation, by act of Congress, as the Territory\r\nof Illinois, with a white population less than one-twentieth of\r\nthat of this good county to-day.  The United States having\r\nbarely escaped a war with France,--our ally in securing our\r\nindependence,--was earnestly struggling for distinct place among\r\nthe nations.\r\n\r\n\"No less significant, and fraught with deep consequences, were\r\nevents occurring in the Old Worlds.  The year 1809 witnessed the\r\nbirth of Darwin and Gladstone.  The despotism of the Dark Ages\r\nstill brooded over Continental Europe, and whatever savored of\r\npopular public rule--even in its mildest form--was yet in the\r\ndistant future.  Alexander the First was on the throne of Russia,--\r\nand her millions of serfs were oppressed as by the iron hand of\r\nthe Caesars.  The splendid German Empire of to-day had no place on\r\nthe map of the world; its present powerful constituencies were\r\nantagonistic provinces and warring independent cities.  Napoleon\r\nBonaparte--'calling Fate into the lists'--by a succession of\r\nvictories unparalleled in history had overturned thrones, compelled\r\nkings upon bended knee to sue for peace, and substituted those\r\nof his own household for dynasties that reached back the entire\r\nlength of human history.  With his star still in the ascendant,\r\ndisturbed by no forecast of the horrid nightmare of the retreat\r\nfrom Moscow, 'with legions scattered by the artillery of the snows\r\nand the cavalry of the winds,' tortured by no dream of Leipsic, of\r\nElba, of Waterloo, of St. Helena, he was still the 'man of destiny,'\r\n--relentlessly pursuing the _ignis fatuus_ of universal empire.\r\n\r\n\"The year that witnessed the birth of Abraham Lincoln witnessed\r\nthe gathering of the disturbing elements that were to precipitate the\r\nsecond war with the mother country.  England--with George the Third\r\nstill upon the throne--by insulting and cruel search of American\r\nvessels upon the high seas, was rendering inevitable the declaration\r\nof war by Congress,--a war of humiliation upon our part by the\r\ndisgraceful surrender of Hull at Detroit and the wanton burning of\r\nour Capitol, but crowned with honor by the naval victories of\r\nLawrence, Decatur, and Perry, and eventually terminated by the\r\ncapture of the British army at New Orleans.  As an object lesson\r\nof the marvels of the closing century, an event of such momentous\r\nconsequence to the world as the formulation of the Treaty of Ghent,\r\nby which peace was restored between England and America, would to-day\r\nbe known at every fireside a few hours after its occurrence.  And yet,\r\nwithin the now closing century, the battle of New Orleans was fought\r\ntwenty-three days after the Treaty of Ghent, coming by slow-sailing\r\nvessels across the Atlantic, had received the signature of our\r\ncommissioners; all unsettled accounts squared eternally between America\r\nand Great Britain; and the United States, by valor no less than by\r\ndiplomacy, exalted to honored and enduring place among the nations.\r\n\r\n\"The fifty-six years that compassed the life of Abraham Lincoln\r\nwere years of transcendent significance to our country.  While\r\nhe was yet in his rude cradle the African slave trade had just\r\nterminated by constitutional inhibition.  While Lincoln was still in\r\nattendance upon the old field school, Henry Clay--yet to be known as\r\nthe 'great pacificator'--was pressing the admission of Missouri\r\ninto the Union under the first compromise upon the question of\r\nslavery since the adoption of the Federal Constitution.  From\r\nthe establishment of the Government the question of human\r\nslavery was the one perilous question,--the one constant menace to\r\nnational unity, until its final extinction amid the flames of war.\r\nMarvellous to man are the purposes of the Almighty.  What seer\r\ncould have foretold that, from this humblest of homes upon the\r\nfrontier, was to spring the man who at the crucial moment should\r\ncut the Gordian knot, liberate a race, and give to the ages enlarged\r\nand grander conception of the deathless principles of the declaration\r\nof human rights?\r\n\r\n  \"'Often do the spirits of great events\r\n  Stride on before the events,\r\n  And in to-day already walks to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n\"The first inauguration of President Lincoln noted the hour of\r\nbreaking with the past.  It was a period of gloom, when the very\r\nfoundations were shaken, when no man could foretell the happening of\r\nthe morrow, when strong men trembled at the possibility of the\r\ndestruction of our Government.\r\n\r\n\"Pause a moment, and recall the man who, under the conditions\r\nmentioned, on the fourth of March, 1861, entered upon the duties\r\nof the great office to which he had been chosen.  He came from the\r\ncommon walks of life--from what, in other countries, would be called\r\nthe great middle class.  His early home was one of the humblest,\r\nwhere he was a stranger to the luxuries and to many of the ordinary\r\ncomforts of life.  His opportunities for education were only such as\r\nwere common in the remote habitations of our Western country one\r\ncentury ago.\r\n\r\n\"Under such conditions, began a career which in grandeur and\r\nachievement has but a single counterpart in our history.  And what\r\na splendid commentary this upon our free institutions,--upon the\r\nsublime underlying principle of popular government!  How inspiring\r\nto the youth of high aims every incident of the pathway that led\r\nfrom the frontier cabin to the Executive Mansion,--from the humblest\r\nposition to the most exalted yet attained by man!  In no other\r\ncountry than ours could such attainment have been possible for the\r\nboy whose hands were inured to toil, whose bread was eaten under\r\nthe hard conditions that poverty imposes, whose only heritage\r\nwas brain, integrity, lofty ambition, and indomitable purpose.\r\nLet it never be forgotten that the man of whom I speak possessed\r\nan integrity that could know no temptation, a purity of life that was\r\nnever questioned, a patriotism that no sectional lines could limit,\r\nand a fixedness of purpose that knew no shadow of turning.\r\n\r\n\"The decade extending from our first treaty of peace with Great\r\nBritain to the inauguration of Washington has been truly denominated\r\nthe critical period of our history.  The eloquence of Adams and\r\nHenry had precipitated revolution; the unfaltering courage of\r\nWashington and his comrades had secured independence; but the more\r\ndifficult task of garnering up the fruits of victory by stable\r\ngovernment was yet to be achieved.  The hour for the constructive\r\nstatesman had arrived, and James Madison and his associates, equal to\r\nthe great emergency, formulated the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"No less critical was the period that bounded the active life of\r\nthe man whose memory we honor to-day.  One perilous question to\r\nnational unity which for nearly three-quarters of a century had\r\nbeen the subject of repeated compromise by patriotic statesmen;\r\nthe apple of discord producing sectional antagonism, whose shadow had\r\ndarkened our national pathway from the beginning,--was now for weal\r\nor woe to find determination.  Angry debate in the Senate and upon\r\nthe forum was now hushed, and the supreme question that took hold of\r\nnational life was to find enduring arbitrament in the dread tribunal\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n\"It was well that in such an hour, with such tremendous issues\r\nin the balance, a steady hand was at the helm; that a conservative\r\nstatesman--one whose mission was to save, not to destroy--was in\r\nthe high place of responsibility and power.  It booted little then\r\nthat he was untaught of schools, unskilled in the ways of courts, but\r\nit was of supreme moment that he could touch responsive chords\r\nin the great American heart, all-important that his very soul\r\nyearned for the preservation of the Government established through\r\nthe toil and sacrifice of the generation that had gone.  How\r\nhopeless the Republic in that dark hour, had its destiny hung upon\r\nthe statecraft of Talleyrand, the eloquence of Mirabeau, or the\r\ngenius of Napoleon!  It was fortunate indeed that the ark of our\r\ncovenant was then borne by the plain, brave man of conciliatory\r\nspirit and kind words, whose heart, as Emerson has said, 'was as\r\nlarge as the world, but nowhere had room for the memory of a wrong.'\r\n\r\n\"Nobler words have never fallen from human lips than the closing\r\nsentences of his first inaugural uttered on one of the pivotal days\r\nof human history, immediately after taking the oath to preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend his country:\r\n\r\n\"'I am loath to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  Though\r\npassion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.\r\nThe mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and\r\npatriot's grave to every heart and hearthstone of this broad land,\r\nwill yet swell the chorus of the Union when touched as they will\r\nbe by the better angels of our nature.'\r\n\r\n\"In the light of what we now know so well, nothing is hazarded\r\nin saying that the death of no man has been to his country so\r\nirreparable a loss, or one so grievous to be borne, as that of\r\nAbraham Lincoln.  When Washington died his work was done, his life\r\nwell rounded out.  Save one, the years allotted had been passed.\r\nNot so with Lincoln.  To him a grander task was yet in waiting,\r\none no other could so well perform.  The assassin's pistol proved the\r\nveritable Pandora's box from which sprung evils untold,--whose\r\nconsequences have never been measured.--to one-third of the States\r\nof our Union.  But for his untimely death how the current of history\r\nmight have been changed,--and many a sad chapter remained unwritten!\r\nHow earnestly he desired a restored Union, and that the blessings of\r\npeace and of concord should be the common heritage of every section,\r\nis known to all.\r\n\r\n\"When in the loom of time have such words been heard above the din\r\nof fierce conflict as his sublime utterances but a brief time before\r\nhis tragic death--\r\n\r\n\"'With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness\r\nin the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\r\nto finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds; to\r\ncare for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow\r\nand his orphan, to do all which may achieve a lasting peace\r\namong ourselves, and with all nations.'\r\n\r\n\"No fitter occasion than this can ever arise in which to refer\r\nto two historical events that at crucial moments tested to the\r\nutmost the safe and far-seeing statesmanship of President Lincoln.\r\nThe first was the seizure upon the high seas of Mason and Slidell,\r\nthe accredited representatives from the Southern Confederacy to\r\nthe courts of England and France, respectively.  The seizure was\r\nin November, 1861, by Captain Wilkes of our navy; and the envoys\r\nnamed were taken by him from the _Trent,_ a mail-carrying steamer of\r\nthe British Government.  The act of Captain Wilkes met with\r\nenthusiastic commendation throughout the entire country; he was\r\nvoted the thanks of Congress, and his act publicly approved by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\n\"The demand by the British government for reparation upon the part\r\nof the United States was prompt and explicit.  The perils that then\r\nenvironed us were such as rarely shadow the pathway of nations.\r\nSave Russia alone, our Government had no friend among the crowned heads\r\nof Europe.  Menaced by the peril of the recognition of the Southern\r\nConfederacy by England and France, with the very stars apparently warring\r\nagainst us in their courses, the position of the President was\r\nin the last degree trying.  To surrender the Confederate envoys\r\nwas in a measure humiliating and in opposition to the popular\r\nimpulse; their retention, the signal for the probable recognition of\r\nthe Southern Confederacy by the European powers, and the certain\r\nand immediate declaration of war by England.\r\n\r\n\"The good genius of President Lincoln--rather his wise, just,\r\nfar-seeing statesmanship--stood him well in hand at the critical\r\nmoment.  Had a rash and impulsive man then held the executive\r\noffice, what a sea of troubles might have overwhelmed us!  How the\r\nentire current of our history might have been changed!\r\n\r\n\"The calm, wise President, in his council chamber, aided by his\r\nclosest official adviser, Secretary Seward, discerned clearly\r\nthe path of national safety and of honor.  None the less was the\r\nact of the President one of justice, one that will abide the\r\nsure test of time.  Upon the real ground that the seizure of the\r\nenvoys was in violation of the Law of Nations, they were eventually\r\nsurrendered, and war with England, as well as the immediate danger\r\nof recognition of the Confederacy, averted.  Let it not be forgotten\r\nthat this very act of President Lincoln was a triumphant vindication\r\nof our Government in its second war with Great Britain--a war waged\r\nas a protest on our part against British seizure and impressment\r\nof American citizens upon the high seas.\r\n\r\n\"The other incident, to which I briefly refer, was the proclamation\r\nof emancipation.  As a war measure of stupendous significance in\r\nthe national defence, as well as of justice to the enslaved,\r\nsuch proclamation, immediate in time and radical in terms, had\r\nto greater or less degree been urged upon the President from the\r\noutbreak of the Rebellion.  That slavery was to perish amid the\r\ngreat upheaval became in time the solemn conviction of all thoughtful\r\nmen.  Meanwhile there were divided counsels among the earnest\r\nsupporters of the President as to the time the masterful act 'that\r\ncould know no backward steps' should be taken.  Unmoved amid divided\r\ncounsels, and at times fierce dissensions, the calm, far-seeing\r\nexecutive, upon whom was cast the tremendous responsibility,\r\npatiently bided his time.  Events that are now the masterful theme\r\nof history crowded in rapid succession, the opportune moment arrived,\r\nthe hour struck, the proclamation that has no counterpart fell upon\r\nthe ears of the startled world, and, as by the interposition of a\r\nmightier hand, a race was lifted out of the depths of bondage.\r\n\r\n\"To the one man at the helm it seemed to have been given to know\r\nthe day and the hour.  At the crucial moment, in one of the exalted\r\ndays of human history,\r\n\r\n  \"'He sounded forth the trumpet that has never called\r\n  retreat.'\r\n\r\n\"The men who knew Abraham Lincoln, who saw him face to face, who\r\nheard his voice in public assemblage, have with few exceptions\r\npassed to the grave.  Another generation is upon the busy stage.\r\nThe book has forever closed upon the dreadful pageant of civil\r\nstrife.  Sectional animosities, thank God, belong now only to\r\nthe past.  The mantle of Peace is over our entire land, and prosperity\r\nwithin our borders.\r\n\r\n  \"'The war-drum throbs no longer,\r\n  And the battle flags are furled\r\n  In the parliament of men,\r\n  The federation of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"Through the instrumentality, in no small measure, of the man whose\r\nmemory we now honor, the Government established by our fathers,\r\nuntouched by the finger of Time, has descended to us.  The\r\nresponsibility of its preservation and transmission rests upon the\r\nsuccessive generations as they come and go.  To-day, at this\r\nauspicious hour sacred to the memory of Lincoln, let us, his\r\ncountrymen, inspired by the sublime lessons of his wondrous life, and\r\ngrateful to God for all He has vouchsafed to our fathers and to us\r\nin the past, take courage and turn our faces resolutely, hopefully,\r\ntrustingly to the future.

Chief among the actors, his place was near the middle\r\nof the stage during that eventful and epoch-making period.\r\n\r\nStephen A. Douglas was born in Brandon, Vermont, April 23, 1813,\r\nand died in Chicago, Illinois, June 3, 1861.  Between the dates\r\ngiven lie the years that up a crowded, eventful life.  Left penniless\r\nby the death of his father, he was at a tender age dependent upon his\r\nown exertions for maintenance and education.  At the age of fifteen\r\nhe apprenticed himself to a cabinet-maker in the town of Middlebury\r\nin his native State.  Naturally of delicate organization, he was\r\nunable long to endure the physical strain of this calling, and\r\nat the close of two years' service he returned to his early home.\r\nEntering an academy in Brandon, he there for a time pursued with\r\nreasonable diligence the studies preparatory to a higher course.\r\nSupplementing the education thus acquired, by a brief course of\r\nstudy in an academy at Canandaigua, New York, at the age of twenty\r\nhe turned his footsteps westward.\r\n\r\nOne of his biographers says:\r\n\r\n\"It is doubtful if among all the thousands who in those early days\r\nwere constantly faring westward from New England, Virginia, and\r\nthe Carolinas, there ever was a youth more resolutely and boldly\r\naddressed to opportunity than he.  Penniless, broken in health,\r\nalmost diminutive in physical stature, and unknown, he made his\r\nway successively to Cincinnati, Louisville, and St. Louis, in search\r\nof employment, literally of bread.\"\r\n\r\nBy a sudden turn in fortune's wheel his lot was cast in Central\r\nIllinois, where his first vocation was that of teacher of a village\r\nschool.  Yet later--after laborious application--admitted to the\r\nbar, he courageously entered upon his marvellous career.\r\n\r\nHis home was Jacksonville, and to the hardy pioneers of Morgan and\r\nneighboring counties, it was soon revealed that notwithstanding\r\nhis slight stature and boyish appearance the youthful Douglas was at\r\nonce to be taken fully into the account.  Self-reliant to the very\r\nverge, he unhesitatingly entered the arena of active professional and\r\npolitical strife with foemen worthy the steel of veterans at the\r\nbar, and upon the hustings.\r\n\r\nThe issues were sharply drawn between the two political parties\r\nthen struggling for ascendancy, and Central Illinois was the home of\r\nas brilliant an array of gifted leaders as the Whig party at any\r\ntime in its palmiest days had known.  Hardin, Stuart, Browning,\r\nLogan, Baker, Lincoln were just then upon the threshold of careers\r\nthat have given their names honored and enduring place upon the\r\npages of our history.  Into the safe keeping of the leaders just\r\nnamed, were entrusted in large degree the advocacy of the principles\r\nof the now historic party, and the political fortunes of its great\r\nchieftain, Henry Clay.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the principal antagonist of the renowned Whig\r\nchieftain was Andrew Jackson.  Earlier in their political careers,\r\nboth had been earnest supporters of the administration of President\r\nMonroe, but at its close the leaders last named, with Adams and\r\nCrawford, were aspirants to the great office.  No candidate receiving\r\na majority of the electoral votes and the selection by Constitutional\r\nrequirement devolving upon the House of Representatives, Mr. Adams\r\nwas eventually chosen.  His election over his principal competitor,\r\nGeneral Jackson, was largely through the influence of Mr. Clay;\r\nand the subsequent acceptance by the latter of the office of\r\nSecretary of State gave rise to the unfounded but vehement cry\r\nof \"Bargain and corruption,\" which followed the Kentucky statesman\r\nthrough two presidential struggles of later periods, and died wholly\r\naway only when the clods had fallen upon his grave.\r\n\r\nTriumphant in his candidacy over Adams in 1828, President Jackson,\r\nfour years later, encountered as his formidable competitor his\r\ncolossal antagonist--the one man for whom he had no forgiveness,\r\neven when the shadows were gathering about his own couch.\r\n\r\n\"The early and better days of the Republic\" is by no means an\r\nunusual expression in the political literature of our day.  Possibly\r\nall the generations of men have realized the significance of the\r\nwords of the great bard:\r\n\r\n  \"Past and to come seem best;\r\n  Things present worst.\r\n  We are time's subjects.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, barring the closing months of the administration of the\r\nelder Adams, this country has known no period of more intense party\r\npassion, or of more deadly feuds among political leaders, than was\r\nmanifested during the presidential contest of 1832.  The Whig party,\r\nwith Henry Clay as its candidate and its idol, was for the first\r\ntime in the field.  Catching something of the spirit of its imperious\r\nleader, its campaign was recklessly aggressive.  The scabbard was\r\nthrown away, and all the lines of retreat cut off from the beginning.\r\nNo act of the party in power escaped the lime-light; no delinquency,\r\nreal or imaginary, of Jackson--its candidate for re-election--\r\nbut was ruthlessly drawn into the open day.  Even the domestic\r\nhearthstone was invaded and antagonisms engendered that knew no\r\nsurcease until the last of the chief participants in the\r\neventful struggle had descended to the tomb.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Clay but intensified his hostility toward his successful\r\nrival, and with a following that in personal devotion to its leader\r\nhas scarcely known a parallel, he was at once the peerless front\r\nof a powerful opposition to the Jackson administration.\r\n\r\nSuch were the existing political conditions throughout the country\r\nwhen Stephen A. Douglas, at the age of twenty-two, first entered\r\nthe arena of debate.  It would not be strange if such environment left\r\nits deep impress, and measurably gave direction to his political\r\ncareer.  The period of probation and training so essential to\r\nordinary men was unneeded by him.  Fully equipped--and with a\r\nself-confidence that has rarely had a counterpart--he was from the\r\nbeginning the earnest defender of the salient measures of the\r\nDemocratic administration, and the aggressive champion of President\r\nJackson.  Absolutely fearless, he took no reckoning of the opposing\r\nforces, and regardless of the prowess or ripe experience of\r\nadversaries, he at all times, in and out of season, gladly welcomed\r\nthe encounter.  To this end, he did not await opportunities, but\r\neagerly sought them.\r\n\r\nHis first contest for public office was with John J. Hardin, by no\r\nmeans the least gifted of the brilliant Whig leaders already\r\nmentioned.  Defeated by Douglas in his candidacy for re-election\r\nto the office of Attorney General, Colonel Hardin at a later day\r\nachieved distinction as a Representative in Congress, and at the\r\nearly age of thirty-seven fell while gallantly leading his regiment\r\nupon the bloody field of Buena Vista.  In the catalogue of men\r\nworthy of remembrance, there is to be found the name of no braver,\r\nmanlier man, than that of John J. Hardin.\r\n\r\nWith well-earned laurels as public prosecutor, Douglas resigned,\r\nafter two years' incumbency of that office, to accept that of\r\nRepresentative in the State Legislature.  The Tenth General Assembly\r\n--to which he was chosen--was the most notable in Illinois history.\r\nUpon the roll of members of the House--in the old Capitol at Vandalia\r\n--are names inseparably associated with the history of the State\r\nand the nation.  From its list were yet to be chosen two Governors\r\nof the commonwealth, one member of the Cabinet, three Justices\r\nof the Supreme Court of the State, eight Representatives in Congress,\r\nsix Senators, and one President of the United States.  That\r\nwould indeed be a notable assemblage of law-makers in any country or\r\ntime, that included in its membership McClernand, Edwards,\r\nEwing, Semple, Logan, Hardin, Browning, Shields, Baker, Stuart,\r\nDouglas, and Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIn this assembly, Douglas encountered in impassioned debate, possibly\r\nfor the first time, two men against whom in succession he was soon\r\nto be opposed upon the hustings as candidate for Congress; and\r\nlater as an aspirant to yet more exalted stations, another, with\r\nwhose name--now \"given to the ages\"--his own is linked inseparably\r\nfor all time.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliant and exciting contest for the national House\r\nof Representatives the State has known--excepting possibly that of\r\nCook and McLean a decade and a half earlier--was that of 1838\r\nbetween John T. Stuart and Stephen A. Douglas.  They were the\r\nrecognized champions of their respective parties.  The district\r\nembraced two-thirds of the area of the State, extending from the\r\ncounties immediately south of Sangamon and Morgan, northward to\r\nLake Michigan and the Wisconsin line.  Together on horseback, often\r\nacross unbridged streams, and through pathless forest and prairie,\r\nthey journeyed, holding joint debates in all the county seats of\r\nthe district--including the then villages of Jacksonville, Springfield,\r\nPeoria, Pekin, Bloomington, Quincy, Joliet, Galena, and Chicago.\r\nThat the candidates were well matched in ability and eloquence\r\nreadily appears from the fact that after an active canvass of\r\nseveral months, Major Stuart was elected by a majority of but eight\r\nvotes.  By re-elections he served six years in the House of\r\nRepresentatives and was one of its ablest and most valuable members.\r\nIn Congress, he was the political friend and associate of\r\nCrittenden, Winthrop, Clay, and Webster.  Major Stuart lives in my\r\nmemory as a splendid type of the Whig statesman of the Golden Age.\r\nCourteous and kindly, he was at all times a Kentucky gentleman\r\nof the old school if ever one trod this blessed earth.\r\n\r\nReturning to the bar after his defeat for Congress, Douglas was,\r\nin quick succession, Secretary of State by appointment of the\r\nGovernor, and Judge of the Circuit and Supreme Courts by election by\r\nthe Legislature.  The courts he held as _nisi prius_ judge were in\r\nthe Quincy circuit, and the last-named city for a time his home.\r\nHis associates upon the Supreme Bench were Justices Treat, Caton, Ford,\r\nWilson, Scates, and Lockwood.  His opinions, twenty-one in number,\r\nwill be found in Scammon's Reports.  There was little in any of\r\nthe causes submitted to test fully his capacity as lawyer or\r\nlogician.  Enough, however, appears from his clear and concise\r\nstatements and arguments to justify the belief that had his life\r\nbeen unreservedly given to the profession of the law, his\r\ntalents concentrated upon the mastery of its eternal principles,\r\nhe would in the end have been amply rewarded \"by that mistress who\r\nis at the same time so jealous and so just.\"  This, however, was\r\nnot to be, and to a field more alluring his footsteps were now\r\nturned.  Abandoning the bench to men less ambitious, he was soon\r\nembarked upon the uncertain and delusive sea of politics.\r\n\r\nHis unsuccessful opponent for Congress in 1842 was the Hon. Orville\r\nH. Browning, with whom, in the State Legislature, he had measured swords\r\nover a partisan resolution sustaining the financial policy of\r\nPresident Jackson.  \"The whirligig of time brings in his revenges,\"\r\nand it so fell out that near two decades later it was the fortune of\r\nMr. Browning to occupy a seat in the Senate as the successor of\r\nDouglas--\"touched by the finger of death.\"  At a later day, Mr.\r\nBrowning, as a member of the Cabinet of President Johnson, acquitted\r\nhimself with honor in the discharge of the exacting duties of\r\nSecretary of the Interior.  So long as men of high aims, patriotic\r\nhearts, and noble achievements are held in grateful remembrance,\r\nhis name will have honored place in our country's annals.\r\n\r\nThe career upon which Douglas now entered was the one for which he\r\nwas pre-eminently fitted, and to which he had aspired from the\r\nbeginning.  It was a career in which national fame was to be\r\nachieved, and--by re-elections to the House, and later to the Senate\r\n--to continue without interruption to the last hour of his life.\r\nHe took his seat in the House of Representatives, December 5, 1843,\r\nand among his colleagues were Semple and Breese of the Senate, and\r\nHardin, McClernand, Ficklin, and Wentworth of the House.  Mr.\r\nStephens of Georgia,--with whom it was my good fortune to serve in\r\nthe forty-fourth and forty-sixth Congresses--told me that he entered\r\nthe House the same day with Douglas, and that he distinctly recalled\r\nthe delicate and youthful appearance of the latter as he advanced to\r\nthe Speaker's desk to receive the oath of office.  Conspicuous\r\namong the leaders of the House in the twenty-eighth Congress were\r\nHamilton Fish, Washington Hunt, Henry A. Wise, Howell Cobb, Joshua\r\nR. Giddings, Linn Boyd, John Slidell, Barnwell Rhett, Robert C.\r\nWinthrop, the Speaker, Hannibal Hamlin, elected Vice-President upon\r\nthe ticket with Mr. Lincoln in 1860, Andrew Johnson, the successor\r\nof the lamented President in 1865, and John Quincy Adams, whose\r\nbrilliant career as Ambassador, Senator, Secretary of State, and\r\nPresident, was rounded out by nearly two decades of faithful service\r\nas a Representative in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe period that witnessed the entrance of Douglas into the great\r\nCommons was an eventful one in our political history.  John Tyler,\r\nupon the death of President Harrison, had succeeded to the great\r\noffice, and was in irreconcilable hostility to the leaders of\r\nhis party upon the vital issues upon which the Whig victory of 1840\r\nhad been achieved.  Henry Clay--then at the zenith of his marvellous\r\npowers--merciless in his arraignment of the Tyler administration, was\r\nunwittingly breeding the party dissentions that eventually compassed\r\nhis own defeat in his last struggle for the Presidency.  Daniel\r\nWebster, regardless of the criticism of party associates, and after\r\nthe retirement of his Whig colleagues from the Tyler cabinet, still\r\nremained at the head of the State Department.  His vindication, if\r\nneeded, abundantly appears in the treaty by which our northeastern\r\nboundary was definitely adjusted, and war with England happily\r\naverted.\r\n\r\nIn the rush of events, party antagonisms, in the main, soon fade\r\nfrom remembrance.  One, however, that did not pass with the occasion,\r\nbut lingered even to the shades of the Hermitage, was unrelenting\r\nhostility to President Jackson.  For his declaration of martial law in\r\nNew Orleans just prior to the battle--with which his own name is\r\nassociated for all time--General Jackson had been subjected to a heavy\r\nfine by a judge of that city.  Repeated attempts in Congress looking to\r\nhis vindication and reimbursement, had been unavailing.  Securing the\r\nfloor for the first time, Douglas--upon the anniversary of the great\r\nvictory--delivered an impassioned speech in vindication of Jackson\r\nwhich at once challenged the attention of the country, and gave him high\r\nplace among the great debaters of that memorable Congress.  In\r\nreply to the demand of an opponent for a precedent for the proposed\r\nlegislation, Douglas quickly responded:\r\n\r\n\"Possibly, sir, no case can be found on any page of American history\r\nwhere the commanding officer has been fined for an act absolutely\r\nnecessary to the salvation of his country.  As to precedents, let us make\r\none now that will challenge the admiration of the world and stand the\r\ntest of all the ages.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a graphic description of conditions existing in New Orleans at\r\nthe time of Jackson's declaration of martial law, \"the city filled\r\nwith traitors, anxious to surrender; spies transmitting information\r\nto the camp of the enemy, British regulars--four-fold the number\r\nof the American defenders--advancing to the attack--in this terrible\r\nemergency, necessity became the paramount law, the responsibility was\r\ntaken, martial law declared, and a victory achieved unparalleled\r\nin the annals of war; a victory that avenged the infamy of the\r\nwanton burning of our nation's Capitol, fully, and for all time.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech was unanswered, the bill passed, and probably Douglas\r\nknew no prouder moment than when, a few months later, upon a visit\r\nto the Hermitage, he received the earnest thanks of the venerable\r\ncommander for his masterly vindication.\r\n\r\nTwo of the salient and far-reaching questions confronting the\r\nstatesmen of that eventful Congress pertained to the settlement of\r\nthe Oregon boundary question, and to the annexation of the republic\r\nof Texas.  The first-named question--left unsettled by the treaty of\r\nGhent--had been for two generations the apple of discord between\r\nthe American and British governments.  That it at a critical moment\r\ncame near involving the two nations in a war is a well-known fact\r\nin history.  The platform upon which Mr. Polk had, in 1844, been\r\nelected to the Presidency, asserted unequivocally the right of the\r\nUnited States to the whole of the Oregon Territory.  The boundary line\r\nof \"fifty-four-forty\" was in many of the States the decisive party\r\nwatchword in that masterful contest.\r\n\r\nDouglas, in full accord with his party upon this question, ably\r\ncanvassed Illinois in earnest advocacy of Mr. Polk's election.\r\nWhen, at a later day, it was determined by the President and his\r\nofficial advisers to abandon the party platform demand of \"fifty-four\r\ndegrees and forty minutes\" as the only settlement of the\r\ndisputed boundary, and accept that of the parallel of forty-nine\r\ndegrees--reluctantly proposed by Great Britain as a peaceable final\r\nsettlement--Mr. Douglas earnestly antagonizing any concession, was\r\nat once in opposition to the administration he had assisted to\r\nbring into power.  Whether the part of wisdom was a strict adherence\r\nto the platform dicta of \"the whole of Oregon,\" or a reasonable\r\nconcession in the interest of peaceable adjustment of a dangerous\r\nquestion, was long a matter of vehement discussion.  It suffices that\r\nthe treaty with Great Britain establishing our northwestern boundary\r\nupon the parallel last named was promptly ratified by the Senate, and\r\nthe once famous Oregon question peaceably relegated to the realm\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nA question--sixty odd years ago--equal in importance with that\r\nof the Oregon boundary was the annexation of Texas.  The \"Lone Star\r\nState\" had been virtually an independent republic since the decisive\r\nvictory of General Houston over Santa Ana in 1837 at San Jacinto, and\r\nits independence as such had been acknowledged by our own and\r\nEuropean governments.  The hardy settlers of this new Commonwealth\r\nwere in the main emigrants from the United States, and earnestly\r\nsolicitous of admission into the Federal Union.  The question of\r\nannexation entered largely into the Presidential canvass of 1844, and\r\nthe \"lone star\" upon Democratic banners was an important factor in\r\nsecuring the triumph of Mr. Polk in that bitterly contested\r\nelection.  In the closing hours of the Tyler administration,\r\nannexation was at length effected by joint resolution of Congress,\r\nand Texas passed at once from an independent republic to a State\r\nof the American Union.  This action of Congress, however, gave deep\r\noffence to the Mexican government, and was the initial in a series\r\nof stirring events soon to follow.  The Mexican invasion, the\r\nbrilliant victories won by American valor, and the treaty of peace\r\n--by which our domain was extended westward to the Pacific--\r\nconstitute a thrilling chapter in the annals of war.  Brief in\r\nduration, the Mexican War was the training school for men whose\r\nmilitary achievements were yet to make resplendent the pages of\r\nhistory.  Under the victorious banners of the great commanders,\r\nTaylor and Scott, were Thomas and Beauregard, Shields and Hill,\r\nJohnston and Sherman, McClellan and Longstreet, Hancock and Stonewall\r\nJackson, Lee and Grant.  In the list of heroes were eight future\r\ncandidates for the Presidency, three of whom--Taylor, Pierce,\r\nand Grant--were triumphantly elected.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the nation's Capitol was held high debate over\r\nquestions second in importance to none that have engaged the profound\r\nconsideration of statesmen--that literally took hold of the issues\r\nof war, conquest, diplomacy, peace, empire.  From its inception,\r\nDouglas was an unfaltering advocate of the project of annexation, and\r\nas chairman of the Committee on Territories, bore prominent part\r\nin the protracted and exciting debates consequent upon the passage\r\nof that measure in the House of Representatives.  In his celebrated\r\ncolloquy with Mr. Adams he contended that the joint resolution\r\nhe advocated was in reality only for the re-annexation of territory\r\noriginally ours under the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.  That something\r\nakin to the spirit of \"manifest destiny\" brooded over the discussion\r\nmay be gathered from the closing sentences of his speech:\r\n\r\n\"Our Federal system is admirably adapted to the whole continent;\r\nand while I would not violate the laws of national or treaty\r\nstipulations, or in any manner tarnish the national honor, I would\r\nexert all legal and honorable means to drive Great Britain and the\r\nlast vestige of royal authority from the continent of North America,\r\nand extend the limits of the republic from ocean to ocean.\"\r\n\r\nElected to the Senate at the age of thirty-four, Douglas took\r\nhis seat in that august body in December, 1847.  On the same day\r\nAbraham Lincoln took the oath of office as a member from Illinois in\r\nthe House of Representatives.  The Senate was presided over by the\r\nable and accomplished Vice-President, George M. Dallas.  Seldom\r\nhas there been a more imposing list of great names than that which\r\nnow included the young Senator from Illinois.  Conspicuous among\r\nthe Senators of the thirty States represented, were Dix of New\r\nYork, Dayton of New Jersey, Hale of New Hampshire, Clayton of\r\nDelaware, Reverdy Johnson of Maryland, Mason of Virginia, King\r\nof Alabama, Davis of Mississippi, Bell of Tennessee, Corwin of\r\nOhio, Crittenden of Kentucky, Breese of Illinois, Benton of Missouri,\r\nHouston of Texas, Calhoun of South Carolina, and Webster of\r\nMassachusetts.  It need hardly be said that the debates of that\r\nand the immediately succeeding Congress have possibly never been\r\nsurpassed in ability and eloquence by any deliberative assembly.\r\n\r\nThe one vital and portentous question--in some one of its many\r\nphases--was that of human slavery.  This institution--until its\r\nfinal extinction amid the flames of war--cast its ominous shadow\r\nover our nation's pathway from the beginning.  From the establishment\r\nof the Government under the Federal Constitution to the period\r\nmentioned, it had been the constant subject of compromise and\r\nconcession.\r\n\r\nHenry Clay was first known as \"the great pacificator\" by his tireless\r\nefforts in the exciting struggle of 1820, over the admission of\r\nMissouri--with its Constitution recognizing slavery--into the\r\nFederal Union.  Bowed with the weight of years, the Kentucky\r\nstatesman, from the retirement he had sought, in recognition of\r\nthe general desire of his countrymen, again returned to the theatre\r\nof his early struggles and triumphs.  The fires of ambition had\r\nburned low by age and bereavement, but with earnest longing that\r\nhe might again pour oil upon the troubled waters, he presented\r\nto the Senate, as terms of final peaceable adjustment of the slavery\r\nquestion, the once famous compromise measures of 1850.\r\n\r\nThe sectional agitation then at its height was measurably the result\r\nof the proposed disposition of territory acquired by the then recent\r\ntreaty with Mexico.  The advocates and opponents of slavery extension\r\nwere at once in bitter antagonism, and the intensity of feeling\r\nsuch as the country had rarely known.\r\n\r\nThe compromise measures--proposed by Mr. Clay in a general bill\r\n--embraced the establishment of Territorial Governments for Utah\r\nand New Mexico, the settlement of the Texas boundary, an amendment\r\nto the Fugitive Slave Law, and the admission of California as a\r\nfree State.  In entire accord with each proposition, Douglas had--by\r\ndirection of the Committee on Territories, of which he was the\r\nchairman--reported a bill providing for the immediate admission of\r\nCalifornia under its recently adopted free State Constitution.\r\nSeparate measures embracing the other propositions of the general bill\r\nwere likewise duly reported.  These measures were advocated by the\r\nIllinois Senator in a speech that at once won him recognized place\r\namong the great debaters of that illustrious assemblage.  After\r\nmany weeks of earnest, at times vehement, debate, the bills in the\r\nform last mentioned were passed, and received the approval of\r\nthe President.  Apart from the significance of these measures as\r\na peace offering to the country, their passage closed a memorable era\r\nin our history.  During their discussion Clay, Calhoun, and Webster\r\n--\"the illustrious triumvirate\"--were heard for the last time in\r\nthe Senate.  Greatest of the second generation of our statesmen,\r\nassociated in the advocacy of measures that in the early day of\r\nthe Republic had given us exalted place among the nations,\r\nwithin brief time of each other, \"shattered by the contentions\r\nof the Great Hall, they passed to the chamber of reconciliation and\r\nof silence.\"\r\n\r\nChief in importance of his public services to his State was that\r\nof Senator Douglas in procuring from Congress a land grant to aid in\r\nthe construction of the Illinois Central Railroad.  It is but\r\njustice to the memory of his early colleague, Senator Breese, to\r\nsay that he had been the earnest advocate of a similar measure in a\r\nformer Congress.  The bill, however, which after persistent opposition\r\nfinally became a law, was introduced and warmly advocated by Senator\r\nDouglas.  This act ceded to the State of Illinois--subject to\r\nthe disposal of the Legislature thereof--\"for the purpose of aiding\r\nin the construction of a railroad from the southern terminus of\r\nthe Illinois and Michigan Canal to a point at or near the junction\r\nof the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, with a branch of the same to\r\nChicago, and another to Dubuque, Iowa, every alternate section\r\nof land designated by even numbers for six sections in width on\r\neach side of said road, and its branches.\"  It is difficult at this\r\nday to realize the importance of this measure to the then sparsely\r\nsettled State.  The grant in aggregate was near three million acres,\r\nand was directly to the State.  After appropriate action by the\r\nState Legislature, the Illinois Central Railroad Company was duly\r\norganized--and the road eventually constructed.\r\n\r\nA recent historian has truly said:\r\n\r\n\"For this, if for no other public service to his State, the name\r\nof Douglas was justly entitled to preservation by the erection\r\nof that splendid monumental column which, overlooking the blue\r\nwaters of Lake Michigan, also overlooks for long distance that iron\r\nhighway which was in no small degree the triumph of his legislative\r\nforecast and genius.\"\r\n\r\nThe measure now to be mentioned aroused deeper attention--more\r\nanxious concern--throughout the entire country than any with which\r\nthe name of Douglas had yet been closely associated.  It pertained\r\ndirectly to slavery, the \"bone of contention\" between the North\r\nand the South, the one dangerous quantity in our national politics\r\nfrom the establishment of the Government.  Beginning with its\r\nrecognition--though not in direct terms--in the Federal Constitution,\r\nit had through two generations, in the interest of peace, been the\r\nsubject of repeated compromise.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories, Douglas in the\r\nearly days of 1854 reported a bill providing for the organization of\r\nthe Territories of Nebraska and Kansas.  This measure, which so\r\nsuddenly arrested public attention, is known in our political\r\nhistory as the \"Kansas-Nebraska Bill.\"  Among its provisions was\r\none repealing the Missouri Compromise or restriction of 1820.  The\r\nend sought by the repeal was, as stated by Douglas, to leave the\r\npeople of said Territories respectively to determine the question of\r\nthe introduction or exclusion of slavery for themselves; in\r\nother words, \"to regulate their domestic institutions in their own\r\nway, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\nThe principle strenuously contended for was that of \"popular\r\nsovereignty\" or non-intervention by Congress, in the affairs of\r\nthe Territories.  In closing the protracted and exciting debate\r\njust prior to the passage of the bill in the Senate, he said:\r\n\r\n\"There is another reason why I desire to see this principle recognized\r\nas a rule of action in all time to come.  It will have the effect to\r\ndestroy all sectional parties and sectional agitation.  If you\r\nwithdraw the slavery question from the halls of Congress and the\r\npolitical arena, and commit it to the arbitrament of those who are\r\nimmediately interested in and alone responsible for its consequences,\r\nthere is nothing left out of which sectional parties can be organized.\r\nWhen the people of the North shall all be rallied under one banner,\r\nand the whole South marshalled under another banner, and each\r\nsection excited to frenzy and madness by hostility to the institutions\r\nof the other, then the patriot may well tremble for the perpetuity\r\nof the Union.  Withdraw the slavery question from the political\r\narena and remove it to the States and Territories, each to decide for\r\nitself, and such a catastrophe can never happen.\"\r\n\r\nThese utterances of little more than half a century ago, fall\r\nstrangely upon our ears at this day.  In the light of all that has\r\noccurred in the long reach of years, how significant the words,\r\n\"No man is wiser than events\"!  Likewise, \"The actions of men are to\r\nbe judged by the light surrounding them at the time--not by the\r\nknowledge that comes after the fact.\"  The immediate effect of the\r\npassage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill was directly the reverse of\r\nthat so confidently predicted by Douglas.  The era of concord\r\nbetween the North and the South did not return.  The slavery\r\nquestion--instead of being relegated to the recently organized\r\nTerritories for final settlement--at once assumed the dimensions\r\nof a great national issue.  The country at large--instead of a\r\nsingle Territory--became the theatre of excited discussion.  The\r\nfinal determination was to be not that of a Territory, but of\r\nthe entire people.\r\n\r\nOne significant effect of the passage of the bill was the immediate\r\ndisruption of the Whig party.  As a great national organization\r\n--of which Clay and Webster had been eminent leaders, and Harrison\r\nand Taylor successful candidates for the Presidency--it now passes\r\ninto history.  Upon its ruins, the Republican party at once came\r\ninto being.  Under the leadership of Fremont as its candidate, and\r\nopposition by Congressional intervention to slavery extension as\r\nits chief issue, it was a formidable antagonist to the Democratic party,\r\nin the Presidential contest of 1856.  Mr. Buchanan had defeated\r\nDouglas in the nominating convention of his party that year.\r\nHis absence from the country as Minister to England, during the\r\nexciting events just mentioned, it was thought would make him a\r\nsafer candidate than his chief competitor, Douglas.  He had been\r\nin no manner identified with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, or the stormy\r\nevents which immediately followed its passage.  In his letter of\r\nacceptance, however, Mr. Buchanan had given his unqualified approval\r\nof his party platform, which recognized and adopted \"the principle\r\ncontained in the organic law establishing the Territories of Nebraska\r\nand Kansas as embodying the only sound and safe solution of the\r\nslavery question.\"  Upon the principle here declared, issue was\r\njoined by his political opponents, and the battle fought to the\r\nbitter end.\r\n\r\nAlthough Douglas had met personal defeat in his aspiration to\r\nthe Presidency, the principle of non-intervention by Congress in\r\nthe affairs of the Territories, for which he had so earnestly\r\ncontended, had been triumphant both in the convention of the party,\r\nand at the polls.  This principle, in its application to Kansas,\r\nwas soon to be put to the test.  From its organization, that\r\nTerritory had been a continuous scene of disorder, often of violence.\r\nIn rapid succession three Governors appointed by the President had\r\nresigned and departed the Territory, each confessing his inability\r\nto maintain public order.  The struggle for mastery between the\r\nFree State advocates and their adversaries arrested the attention of\r\nthe entire country.  It vividly recalled the bloody forays read of\r\nin the old chronicles of hostile clans upon the Scottish border.\r\n\r\nThe parting of the ways between Senator Douglas and President\r\nBuchanan was now reached.  The latter had received the cordial\r\nsupport of Douglas in the election which elevated him to the\r\nPresidency.  His determined opposition to the re-election of Douglas\r\nbecame apparent as the Senatorial canvass progressed.  The incidents\r\nnow to be related will explain this hostility, as well as bring to\r\nthe front one of the distinctive questions upon which much stress was\r\nlaid in the subsequent debates between Douglas and Lincoln.\r\n\r\nA statesman of national reputation, the Hon. Robert J. Walker, was\r\nat length appointed Governor of Kansas.  During his brief administration\r\na convention assembled without his co-operation at Lecompton,\r\nand formulated a Constitution under which application was soon made\r\nfor the admission of Kansas into the Union.  This convention was\r\nin part composed of non-residents, and in no sense reflected the\r\nwishes of the majority of the _bona fide_ residents of the Territory.\r\nThe salient feature of the Constitution was that establishing\r\nslavery.  The Constitution was not submitted to the convention\r\nto popular vote, but in due time forwarded to the President, and\r\nby him laid before Congress, accompanied by a recommendation for\r\nits approval, and the early admission of the new State into the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lecompton Constitution came before the Senate, it at once\r\nencountered the formidable opposition of Senator Douglas.  In\r\nunmeasured terms he denounced it as fraudulent, as antagonistic to\r\nthe wishes of the people of Kansas, and subversive of the basic\r\nprinciple upon which the Territory had been organized.  In the\r\nattitude just assumed, Douglas at once found himself in line\r\nwith the Republicans, and in opposition to the administration he\r\nhad helped place in power.  The breach thus created was destined\r\nto remain unhealed.  Moreover, his declaration of hostility to the\r\nLecompton Constitution was the beginning of the end of years of\r\nclose political affiliation with Southern Democratic statesmen.\r\nFrom that moment Douglas lost prestige as a national leader of his\r\nparty.  In more than one-half of the Democratic States he ceased to\r\nbe regarded as a probable or even possible candidate for the\r\nPresidential succession.  The hostility thus engendered followed\r\nhim to the Charleston convention of 1860, and throughout the exciting\r\nPresidential contest which followed.  But the humiliation of defeat\r\n--brought about, as he believed, by personal hostility to himself--\r\nwas yet in the future.  In the attempted admission of Kansas under\r\nthe Lecompton Constitution, Douglas was triumphant over the\r\nadministration and his former political associates from the South.\r\nUnder what was known as the \"English Amendment,\" the obnoxious\r\nConstitution was referred to the people of Kansas, and by them\r\noverwhelmingly rejected.\r\n\r\nThe close of this controversy in the early months of 1858 left\r\nDouglas in a position of much embarrassment.  He had incurred\r\nthe active hostility of the President, and in large measure of his\r\nadherents, without gaining the future aid of his late associates\r\nin the defeat of the Lecompton Constitution.  His Senatorial term was\r\nnearing its close, and his political life depended upon his\r\nre-election.  With a united and aggressive enemy, ably led, in his\r\nfront; his own party hopelessly divided--one faction seeking his\r\ndefeat--it can readily be seen that his political pathway was by no\r\nmeans one of peace.  Such, in brief outline, were the political\r\nconditions when, upon the adjournment of Congress, Douglas returned\r\nto Illinois in July, 1858, and made public announcement of his\r\ncandidacy for re-election.\r\n\r\nIn his speech at Springfield, June 17, accepting the nomination of\r\nhis party for the Senate, Mr. Lincoln had uttered the words which have\r\nsince become historic.  They are quoted at length, as they soon\r\nfurnished the text for his severe arraignment by Douglas in debate.\r\nThe words are:\r\n\r\n\"We are now far into this fifth year since a policy was initiated\r\nwith the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end\r\nto slavery agitation.  Under the operation of that policy, that\r\nagitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented.\r\nIn my opinion, it will not cease until a crisis shall have been\r\nreached and passed.  'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'\r\nI believe this country cannot endure permanently half slave and\r\nhalf free.  I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not\r\nexpect the house to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be\r\ndivided.  It will become all one thing or all the other.  Either\r\nthe opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it\r\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that\r\nit is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates\r\nwill push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the\r\nStates, old as well as new, North as well as South.\"\r\n\r\nThis, at the time, was a bold utterance, and, it was believed by\r\nmany, would imperil Mr. Lincoln's chances for election.  Mr. Blaine\r\nin his \"Twenty Years of Congress,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln had been warned by intimate friends to whom he had\r\ncommunicated the contents of his speech in advance of its delivery,\r\nthat he was treading on dangerous ground, that he would be\r\nmisinterpreted as a disunionist, and that he might fatally damage the\r\nRepublican party by making its existence synonymous with a destruction\r\nof the Government.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening speech of Senator Douglas at Chicago a few days later--\r\nsounding the keynote of his campaign--was in the main an arraignment\r\nof his opponent for an attempt to precipitate an internecine\r\nconflict, and array in deadly hostility the North against the South.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\"In other words, Mr. Lincoln advocates boldly and clearly a war of\r\nsections, a war of the North against the South, of the free\r\nStates against the slave States--a war of extermination--to be\r\ncontinued relentlessly until the one or the other shall be subdued,\r\nand all the States shall either become free or become slave.\"\r\n\r\nThe two speeches, followed by others of like tenor, aroused public\r\ninterest in the State as it had never been before.  The desire\r\nto hear the candidates from the same platform became general.  The\r\nproposal for a joint debate came from Mr. Lincoln on July 24 and\r\nwas soon thereafter accepted.  Seven joint meetings were agreed\r\nupon, the first to be at Ottawa, August 21, and the last at Alton,\r\nOctober 15.  The meetings were held in the open, and at each place\r\nimmense crowds were in attendance.  The friends of Mr. Lincoln\r\nlargely preponderated in the northern portion of the State, those of\r\nDouglas in the southern, while in the centre the partisans of\r\nthe respective candidates were apparently equal in numbers.  The\r\ninterest never flagged for a moment from the beginning to the close.\r\nThe debate was upon a high plane; each candidate enthusiastically\r\napplauded by his friends, and respectfully heard by his opponents.\r\nThe speakers were men of dignified presence, their bearing such as\r\nto challenge respect in any assemblage.  There was nothing of\r\nthe \"grotesque\" about the one, nothing of the \"political juggler\" about\r\nthe other.  Both were deeply impressed with the gravity of the\r\nquestions at issue, and of what might prove their far-reaching\r\nconsequence to the country.\r\n\r\nKindly reference by each speaker to the other characterized the\r\ndebates from the beginning.  \"My friend Lincoln,\" and \"My friend\r\nthe Judge,\" were expressions of constant occurrence during the\r\ndebate.  While each mercilessly attacked the political utterances of\r\nthe other, good feeling in the main prevailed.  Something being\r\npardoned to the spirit of debate, the amenities were well observed.\r\nThey had been personally well known to each other for many years; had\r\nserved together in the Legislature when the State Capitol was at\r\nVandalia, and at a later date, Lincoln had appeared before the\r\nSupreme Court when Douglas was one of the judges.  The amusing\r\nallusions to each other were taken in good part.  Mr. Lincoln's\r\nprofound humor is now a proverb.  It never appeared to better\r\nadvantage than during these debates.  In criticising Mr. Lincoln's\r\nattack upon Chief Justice Taney and his associates for the Dred\r\nScott decision, Douglas declared it to be an attempt to secure a\r\nreversal of the high tribunal by an appeal to a town meeting.\r\nIt reminded him of the saying of Colonel Strode that the judicial system\r\nof Illinois was perfect, except that \"there should be an appeal\r\nallowed from the Supreme Court to two justices of the peace.\"\r\nLincoln replied, \"That was when you were on the bench, Judge.\"\r\nReferring to Douglas's allusion to him as a kind, amiable, and\r\nintelligent gentleman, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Then as the Judge has complimented me with these pleasant titles,\r\nI was a little taken, for it came from a great man.  I was not very\r\nmuch accustomed to flattery and it came the sweeter to me.  I\r\nwas like the Hoosier with the gingerbread, when he said he reckoned\r\nhe loved it better and got less of it than any other man.\"\r\n\r\nIn opening the debate at Ottawa, Douglas said:\r\n\r\n\"In the remarks I have made on the platform and the position of\r\nMr. Lincoln, I mean nothing personally disrespectful or unkind\r\nto that gentleman.  I have known him for twenty-five years.  There\r\nwere many points of sympathy between us when we first got acquainted.\r\nWe were both comparatively boys, and both struggling with poverty in\r\na strange land.  I was a school-teacher in the town of Winchester,\r\nand he a flourishing grocery-keeper in the town of Salem.  He\r\nwas more successful in his occupation than I was in mine, and hence\r\nmore fortunate in this world's goods.  Lincoln is one of those\r\npeculiar men who perform with admirable skill everything which they\r\nundertake.  I made as good a school-teacher as I could, and when a\r\ncabinet-maker I made a good bedstead and table, although my old boss\r\nsaid I succeeded better with bureaus and secretaries than anything\r\nelse.  I met him in the Legislature and had a sympathy with him\r\nbecause of the up-hill struggle we both had in life.  He was\r\nthen just as good at telling an anecdote as now.  He could beat\r\nany of the boys wrestling or running a foot-race, in pitching quoits\r\nor tossing a copper, and the dignity and impartiality with which\r\nhe presided at a horse-race or a fist-fight, excited the admiration\r\nand won the praise of everybody.  I sympathized with him because\r\nhe was struggling with difficulties, and so was I.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Lincoln replied:\r\n\r\n\"The Judge is woefully at fault about his friend Lincoln being a\r\ngrocery-keeper.  I don't know as it would be a sin if I had been;\r\nbut he is mistaken.  Lincoln never kept a grocery anywhere in\r\nthe world.  It is true that Lincoln did work the latter part of\r\none Winter in a little still house up at the head of a hollow.\"\r\n\r\nThe serious phases of the debates will now be considered.  The\r\nopening speech was by Mr. Douglas.  That he possessed rare power\r\nas a debater, all who heard him can bear witness.  Mr. Blaine in\r\nhis history says:\r\n\r\n\"His mind was fertile in resources.  He was master of logic.  In\r\nthat peculiar style of debate which in its intensity resembles a\r\nphysical combat, he had no equal.  He spoke with extraordinary\r\nreadiness.  He used good English, terse, pointed, vigorous.  He\r\ndisregarded the adornments of rhetoric.  He never cited historic\r\nprecedents except from the domain of American politics.  Inside\r\nthat field, his knowledge was comprehensive, minute, critical.  He\r\ncould lead a crowd almost irresistibly to his own conclusions.\"\r\n\r\nDouglas was, in very truth, imbued with little of mere sentiment.\r\nHe gave little time to discussions belonging solely to the realm\r\nof the speculative or the abstract.  He was in no sense a dreamer.\r\nWhat Coleridge has defined wisdom--\"common sense, in an uncommon\r\ndegree\"--was his.  In phrase the simplest and most telling, he\r\nstruck at once at the very core of the controversy.  Possibly no\r\nman was ever less inclined \"to darken counsel with words without\r\nknowledge.\"  Positive, and aggressive to the last degree, he never\r\nsought \"by indirections to find directions out.\"  In statesmanship--\r\nin all that pertained to human affairs--he was intensely practical.\r\nWith him, in the words of Macaulay, \"one acre in Middlesex is worth\r\na principality in Utopia.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to recall--after the lapse of half a century--the\r\ntwo men as they shook hands upon the speaker's stand, just before the\r\nopening of the debates that were to mark an epoch in American\r\nhistory.  Stephen A. Douglas!  Abraham Lincoln!  As they stood side\r\nby side and looked out upon \"the sea of upturned faces\"--it was\r\nindeed a picture to live in the memory of all who witnessed it.\r\nThe one stood for the old ordering of things, in an emphatic sense\r\nfor the Government as established by the fathers--with all its\r\ncompromises.  The other, recognizing equally with his opponent the\r\nbinding force of Constitutional obligation, yet looking, away from\r\npresent surroundings, \"felt the inspiration of the coming of the\r\ngrander day.\"  As has been well said, \"The one faced the past; the\r\nother, the future.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Lincoln is now a household word.  But little can be\r\nwritten of him that is not already known to the world.  Nothing\r\nthat can be uttered or withheld can add to, or detract from, his\r\nimperishable fame.  But it must be remembered that his great\r\nopportunity and fame came after the stirring events separated from\r\nus by the passing of fifty years.  It is not the Lincoln of history,\r\nbut Lincoln the country lawyer, the debater, the candidate of\r\nhis party for political office, with whom we have now to do.  Born\r\nin Kentucky, much of his early life was spent in Indiana, and\r\nall his professional and public life up to his election to the\r\nPresidency, in Illinois.  His early opportunities for study,\r\nlike those of Douglas, were meagre indeed.  Neither had had the\r\nadvantage of the thorough training of the schools.  Of both it\r\nmight truly have been said, \"They knew men rather than books.\"  From\r\nhis log-cabin home upon the Sangamon, Mr. Lincoln had in his early\r\nmanhood volunteered, and was made captain of his company, in what was\r\nso well known to the early settlers of Illinois as the Black\r\nHawk War.  Later on, he was surveyor of his county, and three times\r\na member of the State Legislature.  At the time of the debates with\r\nSenator Douglas, Mr. Lincoln had for many years been a resident of\r\nSpringfield, and a recognized leader of the bar.  As an advocate,\r\nhe had probably no superior in the State.  During the days of\r\nthe Whig party he was an earnest exponent of its principles, and\r\nan able champion of its candidates.  As such, he had in successive\r\ncontests eloquently presented the claims of Harrison, Clay, Taylor,\r\nand Scott to the Presidency.  In 1846, he was elected a Representative\r\nin Congress, and upon his retirement he resumed the active practice\r\nof his profession.  Upon the dissolution of the Whig party, he cast\r\nin his fortunes with the new political organization, and was in\r\nvery truth one of the builders of the Republican party.  At its\r\nfirst national convention, in 1856, he received a large vote for\r\nnomination to the Vice-Presidency, and during the memorable campaign\r\nof that year canvassed the State in advocacy of the election of\r\nFremont and Dayton, the candidates of the Philadelphia convention.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1858--that of the great debates--Douglas was the better\r\nknown of the opposing candidates in the country at large.  In a\r\nspeech then recently delivered in Springfield, Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n\"There is still another disadvantage under which we labor and to\r\nwhich I will ask your attention.  It arises out of the relative\r\npositions of the two persons who stand before the State as candidates\r\nfor the Senate.  Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown.  All the\r\nanxious politicians of his party have been looking upon him as\r\ncertainly at no distant day to be the President of the United\r\nStates.  They have seen in his ruddy, jolly, fruitful face,\r\npostoffices, land-offices, marshalships, and cabinet appointments,\r\nand foreign missions, bursting and sprouting out in wonderful\r\nexuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands.  On\r\nthe contrary, nobody has ever seen in my poor lank face that any\r\ncabbages were sprouting out.\"\r\n\r\nBoth, however, were personally well known in Illinois.  Each was\r\nby unanimous nomination the candidate of his party.  Douglas had\r\nknown sixteen years of continuous service in one or the other House\r\nof Congress.  In the Senate, he had held high debate with\r\nSeward, Sumner, and Chase from the North, and during the last\r\nsession--since he had assumed a position of antagonism to the\r\nBuchanan administration--had repeatedly measured swords with Tombs,\r\nBenjamin, and Jefferson Davis, chief among the great debaters of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's services in Congress had been limited to a single\r\nterm in the lower house, and his great fame was yet to be achieved,\r\nnot as a legislator, but as Chief Executive during the most critical\r\nyears of our history.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, were the opposing candidates as they entered the\r\nlists of debate at Ottawa, on the twenty-first day of August, 1858.\r\nBoth were in the prime of manhood, thoroughly equipped for the\r\nconflict, and surrounded by throngs of devoted friends.  Both were\r\ngifted with remarkable forensic powers and alike hopeful as to the\r\nresult.  Each recognizing fully the strength of his opponent,\r\nhis own powers were constantly at their tension.\r\n\r\n  \"the blood more stirs\r\n  To rouse a lion than to start a hare.\"\r\n\r\nIn opening, Senator Douglas made brief reference to the political\r\ncondition of the country prior to the year 1854.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"The Whig and the Democratic were the two great parties then in\r\nexistence; both national and patriotic, advocating principles that\r\nwere universal in their application; while these parties differed in\r\nregard to banks, tariff, and sub-treasury, they agreed on the\r\nslavery question which now agitates the Union.  They had adopted\r\nthe compromise measures of 1850 as the basis of a full solution of\r\nthe slavery question in all its forms; that these measures had\r\nreceived the endorsement of both parties in their National Conventions\r\nof 1852, thus affirming the right of the people of each State\r\nand Territory to decide as to their domestic institutions for\r\nthemselves; that this principle was embodied in the bill reported by\r\nme in 1854 for the organization of the Territories of Kansas and\r\nNebraska; in order that there might be no misunderstanding,\r\nthese words were inserted in that bill:  'It is the true intent\r\nand meaning of this act, not to legislate slavery into any State\r\nor Territory, or to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the\r\npeople thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic\r\ninstitutions in their own way, subject only to the Federal\r\nConstitution.'\"\r\n\r\nTurning to his opponent, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to know whether Mr. Lincoln to-day stands as he did in\r\n1854 in favor of the unconditional repeal of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw; whether he stands pledged to-day as he did in 1854 against\r\nthe admission of any more slave States into the Union, even if the\r\npeople want them; whether he stands pledged against the admission of\r\na new State into the Union with such a Constitution as the people of\r\nthat State may see fit to make.  I want to know whether he\r\nstands to-day pledged to the abolition of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia; I desire to know whether he stands pledged to prohibit\r\nslavery in all the Territories of the United States north as well as\r\nsouth of the Missouri Compromise line.  I desire him to answer\r\nwhether he is opposed to acquisition of any more territory\r\nunless slavery is prohibited therein.  I want his answer to\r\nthese questions.\"\r\n\r\nDouglas then addressed himself to the already quoted words of\r\nMr. Lincoln's Springfield speech commencing:  \"A house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand.\"  He declared the Government had\r\nexisted for seventy years divided into free and slave States as\r\nour fathers made it; that at the time the Constitution was framed there\r\nwere thirteen States, twelve of which were slave-holding, and one a\r\nfree State; that if the doctrine preached by Mr. Lincoln that\r\nall should be free or all slave had prevailed, the twelve would\r\nhave overruled the one, and slavery would have been established by\r\nthe Constitution on every inch of the Republic, instead of being\r\nleft, as our fathers wisely left it, for each State to decide\r\nfor itself.  He then declared that:\r\n\r\n\"Uniformity in the local laws and institutions of the different\r\nStates is neither possible nor desirable; that if uniformity had\r\nbeen adopted when the Government was established it must inevitably\r\nhave been the uniformity of slavery everywhere, or the uniformity of\r\nnegro citizenship and negro equality everywhere.  I hold that\r\nhumanity and Christianity both require that the negro shall have\r\nand enjoy every right and every privilege and every immunity\r\nconsistent with the safety of the society in which he lives.\r\nThe question then arises, What rights and privileges are consistent\r\nwith the public good?  This is a question which each State and each\r\nTerritory must decide for itself.  Illinois has decided it for\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\nHe then said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, my friends, if we will only act conscientiously upon this\r\ngreat principle of popular sovereignty, it guarantees to each State\r\nand Territory the right to do as it pleases on all things local\r\nand domestic; instead of Congress interfering, we will continue at\r\npeace one with another.  This doctrine of Mr. Lincoln of uniformity\r\namong the institutions of the different States is a new doctrine\r\nnever dreamed of by Washington, Madison, or the framers of the\r\nGovernment.  Mr. Lincoln and his party set themselves up as wiser than\r\nthe founders of the Government, which has flourished for seventy\r\nyears under the principle of popular sovereignty, recognizing\r\nthe right of each State to do as it pleased.  Under that principle,\r\nwe have grown from a nation of three or four millions to one of\r\nthirty millions of people.  We have crossed the mountains and filled\r\nup the whole Northwest, turning the prairies into a garden, and\r\nbuilding up churches and schools, thus spreading civilization\r\nand Christianity where before there was nothing but barbarism.\r\nUnder that principle we have become from a feeble nation the\r\nmost powerful upon the face of the earth, and if we only adhere to\r\nthat principle we can go forward increasing in territory, in power,\r\nin strength, and in glory, until the Republic of America shall\r\nbe the North Star that shall guide the friends of freedom throughout\r\nthe civilized world.  I believe that his new doctrine preached by\r\nMr. Lincoln will dissolve the Union if it succeeds; trying to array\r\nall the Northern States in one body against the Southern; to excite\r\na sectional war between the free States and the slave States in\r\norder that one or the other may be driven to the wall.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said in reply:\r\n\r\n\"I think and will try to show, that the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise is wrong--wrong in its direct effect, letting slavery\r\ninto Kansas and Nebraska; wrong in its prospective principle,\r\nallowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world where\r\nmen can be found inclined to take it.  This declared indifference,\r\nbut as I must think covert zeal for the spread of slavery, I cannot\r\nbut hate.  I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery\r\nitself.  I hate it because it deprives our Republic of an example of\r\nits just influence in the world--enables the enemies of free\r\ninstitutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites.  I have no\r\nprejudices against the Southern people; they are just what we would\r\nbe in their situation.  If slavery did now exist amongst us we\r\nwould not instantly give it up.  This I believe of the masses North\r\nand South.  When the Southern people tell us they are no more\r\nresponsible for the origin of slavery than we, I acknowledge the\r\nfact.  When it is said that the institution exists, and that it is\r\nvery difficult to get rid of in any satisfactory way, I can understand\r\nand appreciate the same.  I surely will not blame them for what\r\nI should not know how to do myself.  If all earthly powers were\r\ngiven me, I should not know what to do as to the existing\r\ninstitution.\"\r\n\r\nDeclaring that he did not advocate freeing the negroes, and making\r\nthem our political and social equals, but suggesting that\r\ngradual systems of emancipation might be adopted by the States, he\r\nadded, \"But for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to\r\njudge our brethren of the South.  But all this to my judgment\r\nfurnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our free\r\nterritory than it would for reviving the African slave trade by\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nHe then added:\r\n\r\n\"I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery in the States where it exists.  I believe I\r\nhave no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\r\nI have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between\r\nthe white and black races.  But I hold that notwithstanding all\r\nthis there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled\r\nto all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness.  I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the\r\nwhite man.  I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in\r\nmany respects--certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral and\r\nintellectual endowment.  But in the right to eat the bread, without\r\nthe leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal,\r\nand the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the quotation from his Springfield speech of the words,\r\n\"A house divided against itself cannot stand,\" he said:\r\n\r\n\"Does the Judge say it can stand?  If he does, then there is a\r\nquestion of veracity, not between him and me, but between the Judge\r\nand an authority of somewhat higher character.  I leave it to you to\r\nsay whether, in the history of our Government, the institution\r\nof slavery has not only failed to be a bond of union, but on the\r\ncontrary been an apple of discord and an element of division in\r\nthe house.  If so, then I have a right to say that in regard to\r\nthis question the Union is a house divided against itself; and when\r\nthe Judge reminds me that I have often said to him that the\r\ninstitution of slavery has existed for eighty years in some States\r\nand yet it does not exist in some others, I agree to that fact,\r\nand I account for it by looking at the position in which our fathers\r\noriginally placed it--restricting it from the new Territories where\r\nit had not gone, and legislating to cut off its source by abrogation\r\nof the slave trade, thus putting the seal of legislation against\r\nits spread, the public mind did rest in the belief that it was\r\nin the course of ultimate extinction.  Now, I believe if we\r\ncould arrest its spread and place it where Washington and Jefferson\r\nand Madison placed it, it would be in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction, and the public mind would--as for eighty years past\r\n--believe that it was in the course of ultimate extinction.\"\r\n\r\nReferring further to his Springfield speech, he declared that he\r\nhad no thought of doing anything to bring about a war between\r\nthe free and slave States; that he had no thought in the world that\r\nhe was doing anything to bring about social and political equality\r\nof the black and white races.\r\n\r\nPursuing this line of argument, he insisted that the first step in\r\nthe conspiracy, the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, followed soon\r\nby the Dred Scott Decision--the latter fitting perfectly into\r\nthe niche left by the former--\"in such a case, we feel it impossible\r\nnot to believe that Stephen and Franklin, Roger and James, all\r\nunderstood one another from the beginning, and all worked upon a\r\ncommon plan or draft drawn before the first blow was struck.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing, Douglas, after indignant denial of the charge of\r\nconspiracy, said:\r\n\r\n\"I have lived twenty-five years in Illinois; I have served you with\r\nall the fidelity and ability which I possess, and Mr. Lincoln is\r\nat liberty to attack my public action, my votes, and my conduct,\r\nbut when he dares to attack my moral integrity by a charge of\r\nconspiracy between myself, Chief Justice Taney, and the Supreme\r\nCourt and two Presidents of the United States, I will repel it.\"\r\n\r\nAt Freeport, Mr. Lincoln, in opening the discussion, at once declared\r\nhis readiness to answer the interrogatories propounded.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"I do not now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional\r\nrepeal of the Fugitive Slave Law; I do not now, nor ever did, stand\r\npledged against the admission of any more slave States into the\r\nUnion; I do not stand pledged against the admission of a new State\r\ninto the Union with such a Constitution as the people of that State\r\nmay see fit to make; I do not stand to-day pledged to the abolition\r\nof slavery in the District of Columbia; I do not stand pledged\r\nto the prohibition of the slave trade between the different States;\r\nI am impliedly, if not expressly, pledged to a belief in the right\r\nand duty of Congress to prohibit slavery in all the United\r\nStates Territories.\"\r\n\r\nWaiving the form of the interrogatory, as to being pledged, he said:\r\n\r\n\"As to the first one in regard to the Fugitive Slave Law, I have\r\nnever hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I\r\nthink under the Constitution of the United States the people of\r\nthe Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw.  Having said that, I have had nothing to say in regard to the\r\nexisting Fugitive Slave Law further than that I think it should\r\nhave been framed so as to be free from some of the objections that\r\npertain to it without lessening its efficiency.  In regard to\r\nwhether I am pledged to the admission of any more slave States into\r\nthe Union, I would be exceedingly glad to know that there would\r\nnever be another slave State admitted into the Union; but I must\r\nadd that if slavery shall be kept out of the Territories during\r\nthe Territorial existence of any one given Territory, and then the\r\npeople shall, having a fair chance and a clear field when they come\r\nto adopt the Constitution, do such an extraordinary thing as to\r\nadopt a slavery Constitution uninfluenced by the actual presence\r\nof the institution among them, I see no alternative, if we own the\r\ncountry, but to admit them into the Union.  I should be exceedingly\r\nglad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia.  I\r\nbelieve that Congress possesses Constitutional power to abolish\r\nit.  Yet, as a member of Congress, I should not be in favor of\r\nendeavoring to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia unless it\r\nwould be upon these conditions:  First, that the abolition should be\r\ngradual; second, that it should be on a vote of the majority of\r\nqualified voters in the district; third, that compensation should be\r\nmade unwilling owners.  With these conditions, I confess I should be\r\nexceedingly glad to see Congress abolish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, and in the language of Henry Clay, 'Sweep from our Capital\r\nthat foul blot upon our nation.'\"\r\n\r\nThese carefully prepared answers will never cease to be of profound\r\ninterest to the student of human affairs.  They indicate unmistakably\r\nthe conservative tendency of Mr. Lincoln, and his position at\r\nthe time as to the legal status of the institution of slavery.\r\nBut \"courage mounteth with occasion.\"  Five years later, and from the\r\nhand that penned the answers given came the great proclamation\r\nemancipating a race.  The hour had struck--and slavery perished.\r\nThe compromises upon which it rested were, in the mighty upheaval,\r\nbut as the stubble before the flame.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the Freeport debates, Mr. Lincoln propounded to his\r\nopponent four interrogatories as follows:\r\n\r\n\"First, if the people of Kansas shall by means entirely unobjectionable\r\nin all other respects adopt a State Constitution and ask admission\r\ninto the Union under it before they have the requisite number of\r\ninhabitants according to the bill--some ninety-three thousand--\r\nwill you vote to admit them?  Second, can the people of a United\r\nStates Territory in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen\r\nof the United States, exclude slavery from its limits prior to the\r\nformation of a State Constitution?  Third, if the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States shall decide that States cannot exclude slavery from\r\ntheir limits, are you in favor of acquiescing in, adopting, and\r\nfollowing such decision as a rule of political action?  Fourth,\r\nare you in favor of acquiring additional territory in disregard of\r\nhow such acquisition may affect the nation on the slavery question?\"\r\n\r\nThe questions propounded reached the marrow of the controversy,\r\nand were yet to have a much wider field for discussion.  This\r\nwas especially true of the second of the series.  Upon this widely\r\ndivergent--irreconcilable--views were entertained by Northern\r\nand Southern Democrats.  The evidence of this is to be found in\r\nthe respective national platforms upon which Douglas and Mr.\r\nBreckenridge were two years later rival candidates of a divided\r\nparty.  The second interrogatory of Mr. Lincoln clearly emphasized\r\nthis conflict of opinion as it existed at the time of the debates.\r\nIt is but just, however, to Douglas--of whom little that is kindly\r\nhas in late years been spoken--to say that there was nothing in\r\nthe question to cause him surprise or embarrassment.  It would\r\nbe passing strange if during the protracted debates with\r\nSenators representing extreme and antagonistic views, a matter\r\nso vital as the interpretation of the Kansas-Nebraska Act--as\r\nindicated by the interrogatory--had never been under discussion.\r\nConclusive evidence on this point is to be found in the speech\r\ndelivered by Senator Douglas at Bloomington, July 16, forty-two\r\ndays before the Freeport debate, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, my friends, it is impossible under our institutions\r\nto force slavery on an unwilling people.  If this principle of\r\npopular sovereignty, asserted in the Nebraska Bill, be fairly\r\ncarried out by letting the people decide the question for themselves\r\nby a fair vote, at a fair election, and with honest returns, slavery\r\nwill never exist one day or one hour in any Territory against\r\nthe unfriendly legislation of an unfriendly people.  Hence if\r\nthe people of a Territory want slavery they will encourage it by\r\npassing affirmatory laws, and the necessary police regulations; if\r\nthey do not want it, they will withhold that legislation, and by\r\nwithholding it slavery is as dead as if it were prohibited by a\r\nConstitutional prohibition.  They could pass such local laws and\r\npolice regulations as would drive slavery out in one day or one\r\nhour if they were opposed to it, and therefore, so far as the\r\nquestion of slavery in the Territories is concerned in its practical\r\noperation, it matters not how the Dred Scott case may be decided\r\nwith reference to the Territories.  My own opinion on that point\r\nis well known.  It is shown by my vote and speeches in Congress.\"\r\n\r\nRecurring again to the Freeport debate, in reply to the first\r\ninterrogatory, Douglas declared that in reference to Kansas it was\r\nhis opinion that if it had population enough to constitute a slave\r\nState, it had people enough for a free State; that he would not\r\nmake Kansas an exceptional case to the other States of the Union; that\r\nhe held it to be a sound rule of universal application to require a\r\nTerritory to contain the requisite population for a member of\r\nCongress before its admission as a State into the Union; that it\r\nhaving been decided that Kansas has people enough for a slave State,\r\n\"I hold it has enough for a free State.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the third interrogatory, he said that only one man in the\r\nUnited States, an editor of a paper in Washington, had held such\r\nview, and that he, Douglas, had at the time denounced it on the\r\nfloor of the Senate; that Mr. Lincoln cast an imputation upon\r\nthe Supreme Court by supposing that it would violate the Constitution;\r\nthat it would be an act of moral treason that no man on the\r\nbench could ever descend to.  To the fourth--which he said was very\r\n\"ingeniously and cunningly put\"--he answered that, whenever it\r\nbecame necessary in our growth and progress to acquire more territory\r\nhe was in favor of it without reference to the question of slavery,\r\nand when we had acquired it, he would leave the people to do as they\r\npleased, either to make it free, or slave territory as they\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the second interrogatory--of which much has been\r\nwritten--was given without hesitation.  Language could hardly be\r\nmore clear or effective.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"To the next question propounded to me I answer emphatically, as\r\nMr. Lincoln has heard me answer a hundred times, that in my opinion\r\nthe people of a Territory can by lawful means exclude slavery from\r\ntheir limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution.  It\r\nmatters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as\r\nto the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into\r\na Territory under the Constitution, the people have the lawful\r\nmeans to introduce it or exclude it, as they please, for the reason\r\nthat slavery cannot exist a day, or an hour anywhere, unless it is\r\nsupported by local police regulations.  These police regulations\r\ncan only be established by the local Legislature, and if the people\r\nare opposed to slavery they will elect representatives to that body\r\nwho will by unfriendly legislation effectually prevent the introduction\r\nof it into their midst.  If, on the contrary, they are for it, their\r\nLegislature will favor its extension.  Hence, no matter what the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court may be on that abstract question,\r\nstill the right of the people to make a slave Territory or a free\r\nTerritory is perfect and complete under the Nebraska Bill.\"\r\n\r\nThe trend of thought, the unmeasured achievement of activities\r\nlooking to human amelioration, during the fifty intervening years,\r\nmust be taken into the account before uncharitable judgment\r\nupon what has been declared the indifference of Douglas to the\r\nquestion of abstract right involved in the memorable discussion.\r\nIt must be remembered that the world has moved apace, and that a\r\nmighty gulf separates us from that eventful period, in which\r\npractical statesmen were compelled to deal with institutions as\r\nthen existing.  And not to be forgotten are the words of the great\r\ninterpreter of the human heart,\r\n\r\n  \"But know thou this, that men are as the time is.\"\r\n\r\nThe great debates between Douglas and Lincoln--the like of which\r\nwe shall not hear again--had ended and passed to the domain of\r\nhistory.  To the inquiry, \"Which of the participants was the victor?\"\r\nthere can be no absolute answer.  Judged by the immediate result, the\r\nformer; by consequence more remote and far-reaching, the latter.\r\nWithin three years from the first meeting at Ottawa, Mr. Lincoln\r\n--having been elected and inaugurated President--was upon the\r\nthreshold of mighty events which are now the masterful theme of\r\nhistory; and his great antagonist in the now historic debates\r\nhad passed from earthly scenes.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Douglas was ambitious.\r\n\r\n  \"If it were so, it was a grievous fault,\r\n  And grievously hath he answered it.\"\r\n\r\nWe may well believe that, with like honorable ambition to the\r\ntwo great popular leaders of different periods--Clay and Blaine\r\n--his goal was the Presidency.\r\n\r\nIn the last three national conventions of his party preceding\r\nhis death, he was presented by the Illinois delegation to be named\r\nfor the great office.  The last of these--the Charleston convention\r\nof 1860--is now historic.  It assembled amid intense party passion,\r\nand after a turbulent session that seemed the omen of its approaching\r\ndoom, adjourned to a later day to Baltimore.  Senator Douglas there\r\nreceived the almost solid vote of the Northern, and a portion of\r\nthat of the Border States, but the hostility of the extreme Southern\r\nleaders to his candidacy was implacable to the end.  What had seemed\r\ninevitable from the beginning at length occurred, and the great\r\nhistorical party--which had administered the Government with brief\r\nintermissions from the inauguration of Jefferson--was hopelessly\r\nrent asunder.  This startling event--and what it might portend--\r\ngave pause to thoughtful men of all parties.  It was not a mere\r\nincident, but an epoch in history.  Mr. Blaine, in his \"Twenty\r\nYears of Congress,\" says:\r\n\r\n\"The situation was the cause of solicitude and even grief with\r\nthousands to whom the old party was peculiarly endeared.  The\r\ntraditions of Jefferson, of Madison, of Jackson, were devoutly\r\ntreasured; and the splendid achievements of the American Democracy\r\nwere recounted with the pride which attaches to an honorable family\r\ninheritance.  The fact was recalled that the Republic had grown to\r\nits imperial dimensions under Democratic statesmanship.  It was\r\nremembered that Louisiana had been acquired from France, Florida\r\nfrom Spain, the independent Republic of Texas annexed, and California,\r\nwith its vast dependencies, and its myriad millions of treasure,\r\nceded by Mexico, all under Democratic administrations, and in spite\r\nof the resistance of their opponents.  That a party whose history was\r\ninwoven with the glory of the Republic should now come to its end in\r\na quarrel over the status of the negro in a country where his labor\r\nwas not wanted, was to many of its members as incomprehensible\r\nas it was sorrowful and exasperating.  They might have restored\r\nthe party to harmony, but at the very height of the factional\r\ncontest, the representatives of both sections were hurried forward\r\nto the National Convention of 1860, with principle subordinated to\r\npassion, with judgment displaced by a desire for revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal from the Baltimore Convention of a large majority\r\nof the Southern delegates and a small following, led by Caleb\r\nCushing and Benjamin F. Butler from the North, resulted in the\r\nimmediate nomination by the requisite two-thirds vote of Senator\r\nDouglas as the Presidential candidate.  The platform upon the\r\nquestion of slavery was in substance that contended for by the\r\ncandidate in the debates with Lincoln.  The Democratic party divided\r\n--Breckenridge receiving the support of the South--Douglas's\r\ncandidacy was hopeless from the beginning.  But his iron will, and\r\ncourage, that knew no faltering, never appeared to better advantage\r\nthan during that eventful canvass.  Deserted by former political\r\nassociates, he visited distant States and addressed immense audiences\r\nin defence of the platform upon which he had been nominated, and\r\nin advocacy of his own election.  His speeches in Southern States were\r\nof the stormy incidents of a struggle that has scarcely known a\r\nparallel.  Interrogated by a prominent citizen at Norfolk, Virginia,\r\n\"If Lincoln be elected President, would the Southern States be\r\njustified in seceding from the Union?\" Douglas replied, \"I emphatically\r\nanswer, No.  The election of a man to the Presidency in conformity\r\nwith the Constitution of the United States would not justify an\r\nattempt to dissolve the Union.\"\r\n\r\nDefeated in his great ambition, broken in health, the sad witness of\r\nthe unmistakable portents of the coming sectional strife--the\r\nfew remaining months of his mortal life were enveloped in gloom.\r\nPartisan feeling vanished--his deep concern was now only for his\r\ncountry.  Standing by the side of his successful rival--whose\r\nwondrous career was only opening, as his own was nearing its close\r\n--he bowed profound assent to the imperishable utterances of the\r\ninaugural address:  \"I am loath to close.  We are not enemies but\r\nfriends.  We must not be enemies.  Though passion may have strained,\r\nit must not break our bonds of affection.\"\r\n\r\nYet later--immediately upon the firing of the fatal shot at Sumter\r\nthat suddenly summoned millions from peaceful pursuits to arms--\r\nby invitation of the Illinois Legislature Douglas addressed his\r\ncountrymen for the last time.\r\n\r\nBroken with the storms of state, the fires of ambition forever\r\nextinguished, standing upon the threshold of the grave, his soul\r\nburdened with the calamities that had befallen his country, in\r\ntones of deepest pathos he declared:\r\n\r\n\"If war must come--if the bayonet must be used to maintain the\r\nConstitution--I can say before God, my conscience is clear.  I have\r\nstruggled long for a peaceful solution of the trouble.  I deprecate\r\nwar, but if it must come, I am with my country, and for my country,\r\nin every contingency, and under all circumstances.  At all hazards\r\nour Government must be maintained, and the shortest pathway to\r\npeace is through the most stupendous preparation for war.\"\r\n\r\nWho that heard the last public utterance that fell from his lips\r\ncan forget his solemn invocation to all who had followed his\r\npolitical fortunes, until the banner had fallen from his hand,--\r\nto know only their country in its hour of peril?\r\n\r\nThe ordinary limit of human life unreached; his intellectual strength\r\nunabated; his loftiest aspirations unrealized; at the critical\r\nmoment of his country's sorest need--he passed to the grave.  What\r\nreflections and regrets may have been his in that hour of awful\r\nmystery, we may not know.  In the words of another:  \"What blight and\r\nanguish met his agonized eyes, whose lips may tell? what brilliant\r\nbroken plans, what bitter rending of sweet household ties, what sundering\r\nof strong manhood's friendships?\"\r\n\r\nIn the light of what has been discussed, may we not believe that\r\nwith his days prolonged, he would during the perilous years have\r\nbeen the safe counsellor--the rock--of the great President, in\r\npreserving the nation's life, and later in \"binding up the nation's\r\nwounds.\"\r\n\r\nWorthy of honored and enduring place in history, Stephen A. Douglas\r\n--statesman and patriot--lies buried within the great city whose\r\nstupendous development is so largely the result of his own wise\r\nforecast and endeavor,--by the majestic lake whose waves break near\r\nthe base of his stately monument and chant his eternal requiem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nTHE FIRST POLITICAL TELEGRAM\r\n\r\nSENATOR SILAS WRIGHT NOMINATED FOR VICE-PRESIDENT--WORD OF HIS\r\nNOMINATION SENT HIM BY THE MORSE TELEGRAPH--MORSE'S FIRST CONCEPTION\r\nOF AN ELECTRO-MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH--OBSTACLES TO THE CARRYING OUT OF\r\nHIS INVENTION--A BILL APPROPRIATING $30,000 TO TEST THE VALUE OF\r\nHIS TELEGRAPH--EARLIER FORMS OF TELEGRAPHIC INTERCOURSE--A EULOGY ON\r\nTHE INVENTOR BY MR. GARFIELD--ANOTHER, BY MR. COX--THE FIRST MESSAGE\r\nTHAT EVER PASSED OVER THE WIRE--DR. PRIME'S PRAISE OF MORSE AFTER HIS\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\nBy all odds, the most venerable in appearance of the Representatives\r\nin the forty-sixth Congress, was Hendrick B. Wright of Pennsylvania.\r\nAfter a retirement of a third of a century, he had been returned\r\nto the seat he had honored while many of his present associates\r\nwere in the cradle.  Of massive build, stately bearing, lofty\r\ncourtesy; neatly appareled in blue broadcloth, with brass buttons\r\nappropriately in evidence, he appeared indeed to belong to a\r\npast generation of statesmen.\r\n\r\n  \"And thus he bore without abuse\r\n  The grand old name of gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of the many conversations I held with him, he told me that he\r\nwas the president of the Democratic National Convention which met in\r\nBaltimore in 1844.  As will be remembered, a majority of the\r\ndelegates to that convention were favorable to the renomination of\r\nMr. Van Buren, but his recently published letter opposing the\r\nannexation of Texas had rendered him extremely obnoxious to a\r\npowerful minority of his own party.  After a protracted struggle, Mr.\r\nVan Buren, under the operation of the \"two-thirds rule,\" was\r\ndefeated, and Mr. Polk nominated.  The convention, anxious to\r\nplacate the friends of the defeated candidate, then tendered the\r\nnomination for Vice-President to Senator Silas Wright, the close\r\nfriend of Mr. Van Buren.\r\n\r\nAt the time the convention was in session, Samuel F. B. Morse\r\nwas conducting in a room in the Capitol the electrical experiments\r\nwhich have since \"given his name to the ages.\"  Under an appropriation\r\nby Congress, a telegraph line had been recently constructed from\r\nWashington to Baltimore.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the nomination of Senator Wright, as mentioned,\r\nthe president of the convention sent him by the Morse telegraph\r\na brief message, the first of a political character that ever passed\r\nover the wire, advising him of his nomination, and requesting\r\nhis acceptance.  Two hours later he read to the convention a message\r\nfrom Senator Wright, then in Washington, peremptorily declining\r\nthe nomination.\r\n\r\nUpon the reading of this message to the convention, it was\r\nopenly declared to be a hoax, not one member in twenty believing\r\nthat a message could possibly have been received.  The convention\r\nadjourned till the next day, first instructing its president to\r\ncommunicate with Senator Wright by letter.  A special messenger, by\r\nhard riding and frequent change of horse, bore the letter of the\r\nconvention to Wright in Washington, and returned with his reply by\r\nthe time the convention had reassembled.  As will be remembered, Wright\r\npersisting in his declination, George M. Dallas was nominated and duly\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nLater, in conversation with the Hon. Alexander H. Stephens of\r\nGeorgia, he told me that he was in the room of the Capitol set\r\napart for the experiments which Mr. Morse wished to make, and\r\ndistinctly remembered the fact of the transmission of the message to\r\nand from Senator Wright, as stated.\r\n\r\nThe incident mentioned recalls something of the obstacles encountered\r\nby Morse in the marvellous work with which his name is inseparably\r\nassociated.  He first conceived the idea of an electro-magnetic\r\ntelegraph on shipboard on a homeward-bound voyage from Europe in\r\n1832.  Before landing from his long voyage, his plans for a series\r\nof experiments had been clearly thought out.  Having constructed\r\nhis first recording apparatus, his caveat for a patent was filed\r\nfive years later; and in 1838, he applied to Congress for an\r\nappropriation to enable him to construct an experimental line from\r\nWashington to Baltimore in order to demonstrate the practicability\r\nof his invention.  His proposal was at first treated with ridicule\r\n--even with contempt; and for more than three years no favorable\r\naction was taken by Congress.  With abiding faith, however, in the\r\nmerits of his invention, his zeal knew no abatement during years of\r\npoverty and discouragement.  At length in the Twenty-seventh\r\nCongress, Representative Kennedy of Maryland--at a later day\r\nSecretary of the Navy--introduced a bill appropriating thirty\r\nthousand dollars \"to test the value of Morse's Electro-Magnetic\r\nTelegraph,\" to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nBy the untiring efforts of Mr. Kennedy and other Representatives, the\r\nbill was finally brought before the House for consideration near\r\nthe close of the session.  In the light of events, the discussion that\r\nimmediately preceded the vote is of interest, and in no small degree\r\namusing, to this generation.   On February twenty-first, 1843, Mr.\r\nJohnson of Tennessee wished to say a word upon the bill.  As the\r\npresent Congress had done much to encourage science, he did not\r\nwish to see the science of Mesmerism neglected and overlooked.  He\r\ntherefore proposed that one-half of the appropriation be given\r\nto Mr. Fisk to enable him to carry on experiments as well as\r\nProfessor Morse.  Mr. Houston thought that Millerism should also\r\nbe included in the benefits of the appropriation.  Mr. Stanley said\r\nhe should have no objection to the appropriation for Mesmeric\r\nexperiments provided the gentleman from Tennessee was the subject.\r\nMr. Johnson said he should have no objection provided Mr. Stanley was\r\nthe operator.  Several gentlemen now called for the reading of the\r\namendment, and it was read by the clerk as follows:  \"Provided that\r\none-half of the said sum shall be appropriated for trying Mesmeric\r\nexperiments under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mason arose to a question of order.  He maintained that the\r\namendment was not _bona fide,_ and that such amendments were\r\ncalculated to injure the character of the House.  He appealed to\r\nthe Chair, the House being then in committee of the whole, to rule\r\nthe amendment out of order.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman said that it was not for him to judge of the motives of\r\nmembers who offered amendments, and that he could not therefore\r\nundertake to pronounce the amendment not _bona fide._  Objection\r\nmight be raised to it on the ground that it was not sufficiently\r\nanalogous in character to the bill under consideration; but, in\r\nthe opinion of the Chair, it would require a scientific analysis\r\nto determine how far the magnetism of mesmerism was analogous to\r\nthat employed in telegraphs.  He therefore ruled the amendment\r\nin order.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was rejected.  The bill was subsequently reported\r\nfavorably to the House, and two days later passed by the close vote\r\nof eighty-nine to eighty-three.\r\n\r\nThe bill then went to the Senate, and was placed upon the calendar.\r\nA large number of bills were ahead of it, and Mr. Morse was assured\r\nby a kindly Senator that there was no possible chance for its\r\nconsideration.  All hope seemed to forsake the great inventor, as,\r\nfrom his seat in the gallery, he was a gloomy witness of the waning\r\nhours of the session.  Unable longer to endure the strain, he sought\r\nhis humble dwelling an hour before final adjournment.  On\r\narising the next morning, a little girl, the daughter of a faithful\r\nfriend, ran up to him with a message from her father, to the effect\r\nthat in the hurry and confusion of the midnight hour, and just\r\nbefore the close of the session, the Senate had passed his bill,\r\nwhich immediately received the signature of the President.\r\n\r\nWith the sum thus appropriated at his command, Morse now earnestly\r\nresumed the experiments, which a few months later resulted so\r\nsuccessfully.  Referring to the homeward voyage from Europe, in\r\n1832, his biographer says:\r\n\r\n\"One day Dr. Charles S. Jackson of Boston, a fellow passenger,\r\ndescribed an experiment recently made in Paris by means of which\r\nelectricity had been instantaneously transmitted through a great\r\nlength of wire; to which Morse replied, 'If that be so, I see no\r\nreason why messages may not instantaneously be transmitted by\r\nelectricity.'\"\r\n\r\nThe key-note was struck, and before his ship reached New York\r\nthe invention of the telegraph was virtually made, and even the\r\nessential features of the electro-magnetic transmitting and recording\r\napparatus were sketched on paper.  Of necessity, in reaching\r\nthis result, Morse made use of the ideas and discoveries of many\r\nother minds.  As stated by his biographer:\r\n\r\n\"Various forms of telegraphic intercourse had been devised before;\r\nelectro-magnetism had been studied by _savants_ for many years;\r\nFranklin even had experimented with the transmission of electricity\r\nthrough great lengths of wire.  It was reserved for Morse to combine\r\nthe results of many fragmentary and unsuccessful attempts, and put\r\nthem, after many years of trial, to a practical use; and though\r\nhis claims to the invention have been many times attacked in the\r\npress and in the courts, they have been triumphantly vindicated\r\nalike by the law and the verdict of the people, both at home and\r\nabroad.  The Chief Justice of the United States in delivering\r\nthe opinion of the Supreme Court in one of the Morse cases, said:\r\n'It can make no difference whether the inventor derived his\r\ninformation from books or from conversation with men skilled in\r\nthe science; and the fact that Morse sought and obtained the\r\nnecessary information and counsel from the best sources and\r\nacted upon it, neither impairs his right as an inventor, nor detracts\r\nfrom his merits.'\"\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that soon after his first successful experiment,\r\nMorse was harassed by protracted litigation, and that many attempts\r\nwere made to deprive him of the just rewards of his great invention.\r\nTrue, he had been preceded along the same lines by great discoveries.\r\nThis fact no man recognized more unreservedly than himself.  He\r\nwas the inventor, his work, that of gathering up and applying the\r\nmarvellous discoveries of others to the practical purposes of human\r\nlife.  As stated by Mr. Garfield:\r\n\r\n\"His to interpret to the world that subtle and mysterious element with\r\nwhich the thinkers of the human race had so long been occupied.\r\nAs Franklin had exhibited the relation between lightning and the\r\nelectric fluid, so Oersted exhibited the relation between magnetism\r\nand electricity.  From 1820 to 1825, his discovery was further\r\ndeveloped by Davy and Sturgeon of England, and Arago and Ampere of\r\nFrance.  The electro-magnetic telegraph is the embodiment, I might\r\nsay the incarnation, of many centuries of thought, of many generations\r\nof effort to elicit from Nature one of her deepest mysteries.\r\nNo one man, no one century, could have achieved it.  It is the\r\nchild of the human race, the heir of all ages.  How wonderful\r\nare the steps that led to its creation!  The very name of this\r\ntelegraphic instrument bears record of its history--Electric,\r\nMagnetic.\r\n\r\n\"The first, named from the bit of yellow amber whose qualities\r\nof attraction and repulsion were discovered by a Grecian philosopher\r\ntwenty-four centuries ago, and the second, from Magnesia, the\r\nvillage of Asia Minor where first was found the lodestone, whose\r\ntouch turned the needle forever toward the north.  These were\r\nthe earliest forms in which that subtle, all-pervading force revealed\r\nitself to men.  In the childhood of the race men stood dumb in the\r\npresence of its more terrible manifestations.  When it gleamed\r\nin the purple aurora, or shot dusky-red from the clouds, it was\r\nthe eye-flash of an angry God before whom mortals quailed in helpless\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\nMore than three centuries ago, Shakespeare put into the mouth of\r\none of his creations the words,\r\n\r\n  \"I'll put a girdle round about the earth\r\n  In forty minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThe words spoken in jest were in the nature of a prophecy.  After the\r\npassing of many generations, in a country unknown to the great\r\nbard, Morse, in the words of Mr. Cox, one of the most eloquent\r\nof his eulogists--\r\n\r\n\"Gave to the universal people the means of speedy and accurate\r\nintelligence, and so stormed at once the castles of the terrible\r\nGiant Doubt and Giant Despair.  He has saved time, shortened the\r\nhours of toil, accumulated and intensified thought by the rapidity\r\nand terseness of electric messages.  He has celebrated treaties.\r\nGo to the uttermost parts of the earth; go beneath the deep sea;\r\nto the land where snows are eternal, or to the tropical realms\r\nwhere the orange blooms in the air of mid-winter, and you will find\r\nthis clicking, persistent, sleepless instrument ready to give\r\nits tireless wing to your purpose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to serve in the House of Representatives\r\nwith Mr. Stephens of Georgia, and Mr. Wood of New York, both of\r\nwhom more than a third of a century before had given their votes\r\nin favor of the appropriation that made it possible for Morse to\r\nprosecute experiments fraught with such stupendous blessing to our\r\nrace.  The member who reported back the bill from the Committee on\r\nCommerce, with favorable recommendations, and then supported it by\r\nan eloquent speech upon the floor of the House, was Robert C.\r\nWinthrop of Massachusetts.  No public man I have ever known impressed\r\nme more favorably than did Mr. Winthrop.  He had been the close\r\nfriend of Everett, Choate, Webster, and Clay.  He was the last\r\nsurvivor of as brilliant a coterie of party leaders and statesmen as\r\nour country has ever known.  On a visit he made to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, of which he had many years before been the Speaker,\r\nbusiness was at once suspended, and the members from all parts\r\nof the Great Hall gathered about him.  In a letter to the Morse\r\nMemorial meeting in Boston, Mr. Winthrop stated that he was present\r\nin the Capitol while the first formal messages were passing along the\r\nmagic cords between Washington and Baltimore.  He referred to the\r\ndeclination read by Senator Wright in his presence, of the nomination\r\nto the Vice-Presidency tendered him, and added:\r\n\r\n\"All this gave us the most vivid impression, not only that a new\r\nkind of _wire-pulling_ had entered into politics, but that a\r\nmysterious and marvellous power of the air had at length been\r\nsubdued and trained to the service of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact in this connection, to note that the\r\nlittle girl, Miss Ellsworth, who brought to Mr. Morse the joyful\r\ntidings of the passage of the bill on that early May morning in\r\n1843, was rewarded by being requested by the great inventor to\r\nwrite the first message that ever passed over the wire.  When\r\nshe selected,\r\n\r\n  \"What hath God wrought,\"\r\n\r\nwords to find utterance by all tongues--she builded better than\r\nshe knew, for in the words of Speaker Blaine:\r\n\r\n\"The little thread of wire placed as a timid experiment between\r\nthe national capital and a neighboring city grew, and lengthened, and\r\nmultiplied with almost the rapidity of the electric current that\r\ndarted along its iron nerves, until, within his own lifetime,\r\ncontinent was bound to continent, hemisphere answered through\r\nocean's depths to hemisphere, and an encircled globe dashed forth his\r\neulogy in the unmatched eloquence of a grand achievement.\"\r\n\r\nWords of praise, spoke by Dr. Prime, of the great inventor just\r\nafter he had passed from the world, to which he left such a heritage,\r\ncan never lose their interest:\r\n\r\n\"Morse in his coffin is a recollection never to fade.  He lay like\r\nan ancient prophet or sage such as the old masters painted for\r\nAbraham, or Isaiah.  His finely chiselled features, classical in\r\ntheir mould and majestic in repose, and heavy flowing beard; the\r\ndeath calm upon the brow that for eighty years had concealed a\r\nteeming brain, and that placid beauty that lingers upon the face\r\nof the righteous dead, as if the freed spirit had left a smile upon\r\nits forsaken home--these are the memories that remain of the\r\nmost illustrious and honored private citizen that the New World\r\nhas yet given to mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\nALONG THE BYPATHS OF HISTORY\r\n\r\nTHE WIDOW OF GEN. GAINES CLAIMS PROPERTY AT NEW ORLEANS WORTH\r\n$30,000,000--HER SUCCESS AFTER MUCH LITIGATION--THE WIDOW OF JOHN H.\r\nEATON, SECRETARY OF WAR--A CLOUD ON HER REPUTATION--HER HUSBAND\r\nA FRIEND OF GEN. JACKSON--A DUEL BETWEEN RANDOLPH AND CLAY--HOSTILITY\r\nOF THE LEADERS OF WASHINGTON SOCIETY TO MRS. EATON--SECRETARY EATON\r\nDISLIKED BY HIS COLLEAGUES--CONSEQUENT DISRUPTION OF JACKSON'S\r\nCABINET--MRS. EATON'S POVERTY IN HER OLD AGE.\r\n\r\nNearly a third of a century ago, as the guest in a Washington house,\r\nI had the opportunity of meeting Mrs. Gaines, the widow of General\r\nEdmund P. Gaines, a distinguished officer of the War of 1812,\r\nand Mrs. Eaton, the widow of the Hon. John H. Eaton of Tennessee, for\r\na number of years a Senator from that State, and later Secretary of\r\nWar during the administration of President Jackson.  Their names\r\nsuggested interesting events in our history, I gladly availed myself\r\nof the invitation to meet them.\r\n\r\nI found Mrs. Gaines an old lady of small stature, with a profusion\r\nof curls, and gifted with rare powers of conversation.  She\r\nspoke freely of her great lawsuits, one of which was then pending in\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.  As I listened, I thought of\r\nthe wonderful career of the little woman before me.  Few names,\r\na half-century ago, were more familiar to the reading public\r\nthan that of Myra Clark Gaines.  She was born in New Orleans in\r\nthe early days of the century; was the daughter of Daniel Clark,\r\nwho died in 1813, the owner of a large portion of the land upon\r\nwhich the city of New Orleans was afterwards built.  She was his\r\nonly heir, and soon after attaining her majority, instituted a suit,\r\nor series of suits, for the recovery of her property.  After years\r\nof litigation, the seriously controverted fact of her being the\r\nlawful heir of Daniel Clark was established, and the contest, which\r\nwas to wear out two generations of lawyers, began in dead earnest.\r\nThe value of the property involved in the litigation then exceeded\r\nthirty millions of dollars.  At the time I saw her, she had just\r\narrived from her home in New Orleans to be present at the argument\r\nof one of her suits in the Supreme Court.  She had already received\r\nnearly six millions of dollars by successful litigation, and she\r\nassured me that she intended to live one hundred years longer, if\r\nnecessary, to obtain her rights, and that she expected to recover every\r\ndollar to which she was rightfully entitled.  The air of confidence\r\nwith which she spoke, and the pluck manifested in her every word\r\nand motion, convinced me at once that the only possible question\r\nas to her ultimate success was that of time.  And so indeed it\r\nproved, for,\r\n\r\n  \"When like a clock worn out with eating time,\r\n  The wheels of weary life at last stood still,\"\r\n\r\nnumerous suits, in which she had been successful in the lower\r\ncourts, were still pending in the higher.\r\n\r\nShe told me with apparent satisfaction, during the interview, that\r\nshe could name over fifty lawyers who had been against her since\r\nthe beginning of her contest, all of whom were now in their graves.\r\nHer litigation was the one absorbing thought of her life, her\r\none topic of conversation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gaines had died many years before, and her legal battles,--\r\nextending through several decades and against a host of adversaries,\r\n--she had, with courage unfaltering and patience that knew no shadow\r\nof weariness, prosecuted single-handed and alone.\r\n\r\nIn view of the enormous sums involved, the length of time consumed\r\nin the litigation, the number and ability of counsel engaged,\r\nand the antagonisms engendered, the records of our American courts\r\nwill be searched in vain for a parallel to the once famous suit of\r\nMyra Clark Gaines against the city of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this interview, I was soon in conversation with\r\nthe older of the two ladies.  Mrs. Eaton was then near the close\r\nof an eventful life, one indeed without an approximate parallel in\r\nour history.  Four score years ago, there were few persons in\r\nthe village of Washington to whom \"Peggy O'Neal\" was a stranger.\r\nHer father was the proprietor of a well-known, old-style tavern on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, which, during the sessions of Congress,\r\nincluded among its guests many of the leading statesmen of that day.\r\nOf this number were Benton, Randolph, Eaton, Grundy, and others\r\nequally well known.  The daughter, a girl of rare beauty, on account\r\nof her vivacity and grace soon became a great favorite with all.\r\nShe was without question one of the belles of Washington.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to realize that the care-worn face before me\r\nwas that of the charming Peggy O'Neal of early Washington days.\r\nDistress, poverty, slander possibly, had measurably wrought the\r\nsad change, but after all,\r\n\r\n  \"the surest poison is Time.\"\r\n\r\nTraces of her former self still lingered, however, and her erect\r\nform and dignified mien would have challenged respect in any\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nWhile yet in her teens, she had married a purser in the Navy,\r\nwho soon after died by his own hand, while on a cruise in the\r\nMediterranean.  A year or two after his death, with reputation\r\nsomewhat clouded, she married the Honorable John H. Eaton, then\r\na Senator from Tennessee.  He was many years her senior, was one\r\nof the leading statesmen of the day, and had rendered brilliant\r\nservice in the campaign which terminated so triumphantly at New\r\nOrleans.  He was the devoted personal and political friend of\r\nGeneral Jackson, his earliest biographer, and later his earnest\r\nadvocate for the Presidency.  Indeed, the movement having in view\r\nthe election of \"Old Hickory\" was inaugurated by Major Eaton assisted\r\nby Amos Kendall and Francis P. Blair.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1824, before the days of national conventions.\r\nEaton visited several of the States in the interest of his old\r\ncommander, and secured the hearty co-operation of many of the most\r\ninfluential men.  It was in large degree through his personal\r\nefforts that the Legislatures of Pennsylvania and Tennessee proposed\r\nthe name of Andrew Jackson for the great office.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential contest of that year marked an epoch in our\r\npolitical history.  It was at the close of the Monroe administration,\r\n\"the era of good feeling.\"  The struggle for supremacy which\r\nimmediately followed was the precursor of an era of political strife\r\nwhich left its deep and lasting impress upon the country.  Of\r\nthe four candidates in the field, two were members of the outgoing\r\nCabinet of President Monroe:  John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State,\r\nand William H. Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury.  The remaining\r\ncandidates were Henry Clay, the eloquent and accomplished Speaker of\r\nthe House of Representatives, and Andrew Jackson, \"the hero of New\r\nOrleans.\"  The candidates were all of the same party, that founded\r\nby Jefferson; the sun of the once powerful Federalists had set,\r\nand the Whig party was yet in the future.\r\n\r\nNo one of the candidates receiving a majority of the electoral\r\nvote, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives.\r\nMr. Clay being the lowest upon the list, the choice by constitutional\r\nrequirement was to be made from his three competitors.  The influence\r\nof the Kentucky statesman was thrown to Mr. Adams, who was duly\r\nelected, receiving the votes of a bare majority of the States.  The\r\ndetermining vote was given by the sole representative from Illinois,\r\nthe able and brilliant Daniel P. Cook, a friend of Mr. Clay.\r\nThe sad sequel was the defeat of Cook at the next Congressional\r\nelection, his immediate retirement from public life, and early and\r\nlamented death.\r\n\r\nNot less sad was the effect of the vote just given upon the political\r\nfortunes of Henry Clay.  His high character and distinguished public\r\nservices were scant protection against the clamor that immediately\r\nfollowed his acceptance of the office of Secretary of State tendered\r\nhim by President Adams.  \"Bargain and Corruption\" was the terrible\r\nslogan of his enemies in his later struggles for the Presidency\r\nand its echo scarcely died out with that generation.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, the bitter words spoken in the Senate by\r\nJohn Randolph will be recalled:  \"the coalition between the Puritan\r\nand the blackleg.\"  The duel which followed, now historic, stands alone\r\nin the fierce conflicts of men.  Whatever the faults of Randolph, let\r\nit be remembered to his eternal honor, that after receiving at\r\nshort range the fire of Mr. Clay, he promptly discharged his own\r\npistol in the air.  Even after the lapse of eighty years how pleasing\r\nthese words:  \"At which Mr. Clay, throwing down his own pistol,\r\nadvanced with extended hand to Mr. Randolph, who taking his hand\r\nquietly remarked, 'You owe me a coat, Mr. Clay,' to which the latter\r\nexclaimed, 'Thank God the obligation is no greater!'\"\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the defeat of Jackson, his friends began the\r\nagitation which resulted in his overwhelming triumph over Adams,\r\nin 1828.  Chief among his supporters in this, as in his former\r\ncontest, was Major Eaton.  The untiring devotion of Jackson to his\r\nfriends is well known.  It rarely found more striking illustration\r\nthan in the selection of Eaton as Secretary of War, and in the zeal\r\nwith which he sustained him through good and evil report alike,\r\nduring later years.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that Senator Eaton was to hold a seat in\r\nthe Cabinet of the new administration, the fashionable circles\r\nof the capital were deeply agitated, and protests earnest and\r\nvehement assailed the ears of the devoted President.  The objections\r\nurged were not against Major Eaton, but against his beautiful\r\nand accomplished wife.  Rumors of an exceedingly uncomplimentary\r\ncharacter, that had measurably died out with time, were suddenly\r\nrevived against Mrs. Eaton, and gathered force and volume with each\r\npassing day.  It is hardly necessary to say that this hostility was,\r\nin the main, from her own sex.  To all remonstrances and\r\nappeals, however, President Jackson turned a deaf ear.  The kindness\r\nshown by the mother of Mrs. Eaton to the wife of the President\r\nduring a former residence, and while he was a Senator, in Washington,\r\nhad never been forgotten.  It will be remembered that during the\r\nlate Presidential contest not only had Jackson himself been the\r\nobject of merciless attack, but even his invalid wife did not\r\nescape.  Divorced from her first husband because of his cruel\r\ntreatment, she had married Jackson, when he was a young lawyer\r\nin Nashville, many years before.  As the result of the aspersions cast\r\nupon her, the once famous duel was evolved in which Charles Dickinson\r\nfell by the hand of Jackson in 1806.\r\n\r\nAfter his election, but before his inauguration, Mrs. Jackson died,\r\nthe victim of calumny as her husband always believed.  A few\r\ndays after he had turned away from that new-made grave, he was\r\nin the turmoil of politics at the national capital.  With the past\r\nfresh in his memory, it is not strange that he espoused the cause of\r\nhis faithful friend, and the daughter of the woman who had befriended\r\none dearer to him than his own life.  Thoroughly convinced of the\r\ninnocence of Mrs. Eaton, he made her cause his own, and to the end\r\nhe knew no variableness or shadow of turning.\r\n\r\nThe new administration was not far upon its tempestuous voyage\r\nbefore the trouble began.  The relentless hostility of the leaders\r\nof Washington society against Mrs. Eaton was manifested in every\r\npossible way.  Their doors were firmly closed against her.  This, of\r\nitself, would have been of comparatively little moment, but serious\r\nconsequences were to grow out of it.  From private parlors and\r\ndrawing-rooms the controversy soon reached the little coterie that\r\nconstituted the official family of President Jackson.  While this is\r\nalmost forgotten history now, one chapter of Jackson's biography\r\npublished soon after the events mentioned, was headed, \"Mr. Van\r\nBuren calls upon Mrs. Eaton.\"  As is well known, the creed in action\r\nof the most suave of our presidents was,\r\n\r\n  \"The statues of our stately fortunes\r\n  Are sculptured with the chisel, not the axe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren was Secretary of State, and one of the most agreeable\r\nand politic of statesmen.  He was in line of succession to the\r\ngreat office, and understood well the importance of maintaining\r\nhis hold upon President Jackson.  A widower himself, the call upon\r\nwhich so much stress was laid at the time subjected the Secretary of\r\nState to no embarrassment at home.  Not so, however, with three of\r\nhis colleagues in the Cabinet:  Mr. Ingham, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, Mr. Branch of the Navy, and Mr. Berrien the Attorney-General.\r\nThe wife of each of these gentlemen refused to return Mrs. Eaton's\r\ncall, or to recognize her in any possible manner.  No remonstrance\r\non the part of the President could avail to secure even a formal\r\nexchange of courtesies on the part of these ladies.  All this only\r\nintensified the determination on the part of the President to secure\r\nto the wife of the Secretary of War the social recognition to which\r\nhe considered her justly entitled, but it would not avail; the\r\npurpose of the most resolute man on earth was powerless against\r\na determination equal to his own.  Never was more forcibly exemplified\r\nthe truth of the old couplet:\r\n\r\n  \"When a woman will, she will, you may depend on't,\r\n  And when she won't, she won't, and there's an end on't.\"\r\n\r\nAs to how Mrs. Eaton meanwhile appeared to others, something may\r\nbe gleaned from the statement of a distinguished gentleman who\r\ncalled at the home of the Secretary of War:\r\n\r\n\"I went to the house in the evening, and found assembled there a\r\nlarge company of gentlemen who paid assiduous court to the lady.\r\nMrs. Eaton was not then the celebrated character she was destined ere\r\nlong to be made.  To me she seemed a strikingly beautiful and\r\nfascinating woman, all graciousness and vivacity--the life of\r\nthe company.\"\r\n\r\nThat the discordant status of the households of the official advisers\r\nof the President was the topic of discussion among leading statesmen,\r\nmay be inferred from the following extract from a letter written\r\nat the time by Daniel Webster:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Van Buren has evidently, at this moment, quite the lead in\r\ninfluence and importance.  He controls all the pages on the back\r\nstairs, and flatters what seems to be, at present, the Aaron's\r\nserpent among the President's desires, a settled purpose of making\r\nout of the lady of whom so much has been said, a person of\r\nreputation.\"\r\n\r\nOf curious interest even now, is the closing sentence in Mr.\r\nWebster's letter, in which with prophetic ken he forecasts the\r\neffect of the Eaton controversy upon national politics:  \"It is\r\nodd enough, but too evident to be doubted, that the consequence of\r\nthis dispute in the social and fashionable world is producing great\r\npolitical effects, and _may very probably determine who shall be\r\nsuccessor to the present chief magistrate.\"_\r\n\r\nAs explanatory of the above quotation, it will be remembered\r\nthat next to President Jackson, the two most prominent leaders\r\nof the dominant party were Vice-President Calhoun and Secretary of\r\nState Van Buren.  The political forces were even then gathering\r\naround one or the other of these great leaders, and there was little\r\nquestion in official circles that the successor to Jackson would\r\nbe either Van Buren or Calhoun.  It was equally certain that the\r\nsuccessful aspirant would be the one who had the good fortune to\r\nsecure the powerful influence of Jackson.  Chief among the friends\r\nof Calhoun were the Cabinet officers Ingham, Branch, and Berrien.\r\nThe incumbent of the office of Postmaster-General--now for the\r\nfirst time a Cabinet office--was William T. Barry of Kentucky.  He\r\nwas the friend of Van Buren, and in the social controversy mentioned,\r\nhe sided with the President and the Secretary of State as a champion\r\nof Mrs. Eaton.  As to the views of the Vice-President upon the\r\nall-absorbing question, we have no information.  Not being one\r\nof the official advisers of the President, he probably kept entirely\r\naloof from a controversy no doubt in every way distasteful to him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the relations between Secretary Eaton and his colleagues\r\nof the Treasury, Navy, and Department of Justice, became more\r\nand more unfriendly, until all communication other than of the most\r\nformal official character ceased.  The soul of the President was\r\nvexed beyond endurance; and as under existing conditions harmony\r\nin his official family was impossible, he determined upon a\r\nreorganization of his Cabinet.  To this end, the resignations of\r\nVan Buren, Eaton, and Barry were voluntarily tendered, and promptly\r\naccepted.  A formal request from the President to Messrs. Ingham,\r\nBranch, and Berrien secured the resignation of these three official\r\nadvisers; and thus was brought about what is known in our political\r\nhistory as \"the disruption of Jackson's Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThe three gentlemen whose resignations had been voluntarily tendered,\r\nwere, in modern political parlance, at once \"taken care of.\"\r\nMr. Van Buren was appointed minister to St. James, Barry to Madrid,\r\nand Eaton to the governorship of Florida Territory.  No such\r\ngood fortune, however, was in store for either Ingham, Branch,\r\nor Berrien.  Each was, henceforth, _persona non grata_ with President\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nThe end, however, was not yet.  A publication by the retiring\r\nSecretary of the Treasury contained an uncomplimentary allusion to\r\nMrs. Eaton, which resulted first in his receiving a challenge from\r\nher husband, and later in a street altercation.\r\n\r\nThe almost forgotten incidents just mentioned were rapidly leading\r\nup to matters of deep consequence.  The true significance of the\r\nwords of Webster last quoted will now appear.  A rupture, never\r\nyet fully explained, now occurred between President Jackson and\r\nMr. Calhoun.  The intention of the former to secure to Mr. Van\r\nBuren the succession to the presidency was no longer a matter of\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nVan Buren, \"the favorite,\" was meanwhile reposing upon no bed of\r\nroses.  He was, in very truth, \"in the thick of events.\"  His\r\nconfirmation as Minister was defeated by the casting vote of\r\nVice-President Calhoun, after the formal presentation of his\r\ncredentials to the Court to which he had been accredited.  It\r\nwas believed that this rejection would prove the death knell to\r\nVan Buren's Presidential hopes.  But it was not so to be.  His\r\nrejection aroused deep sympathy, secured his nomination upon the\r\nticket with Jackson in 1832, and for four years he presided over\r\nthe great body which had so lately rejected his nomination, and as\r\nis well known, four years later he was chosen to succeed Jackson\r\nas President.  Unfortunately for Calhoun, one of the ablest and\r\npurest of statesmen, he had incurred the hostility of Jackson, and\r\nnever attained the goal of his ambition.\r\n\r\nDuring my interview with Mrs. Eaton I said to her, \"Madam, you must\r\nhave known General Jackson when he was President?\"  \"Known General\r\nJackson,\" she replied, \"known General Jackson?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" I said,\r\n\"your husband was a member of his Cabinet and of course you must\r\nhave known him.  I would like to know what kind of a man General\r\nJackson really was?\"  \"What kind of a man,\" replied Mrs. Eaton in a\r\nmanner and tone not easily forgotten.  \"What kind of _a man_--a\r\ngod, sir, a god.\"  The spirit of the past seemed over her, as with\r\ntrembling voice and deep emotion she spoke of the man whose powerful\r\nand unfaltering friendship had been her stay and bulwark during\r\nthe terrible ordeal through which she had passed.\r\n\r\nAccompanying her that evening to the humble home provided for her by\r\na distant relative, she remarked, \"I have seen the time, sir, when\r\nI could have invited you to an elegant home.\"  She then said\r\nthat when Major Eaton died, he left for her an ample fortune but\r\nthat some years later she unfortunately married a man younger than\r\nherself, who succeeded in getting her property into his hands\r\nand then cruelly deserted her.\r\n\r\nFiction indeed seems commonplace when contrasted with the story of\r\nreal life such as this now penniless and forgotten woman had known.\r\nOnce surrounded by all that wealth could give, herself one of\r\nthe most beautiful and accomplished of women, her husband the\r\nincumbent of exalted official position,--now, wealth, beauty,\r\nand position vanished; the grave hiding all she loved; sitting\r\nin silence and desolation, the memories of the long past almost\r\nher sole companions.  When in the tide of time has there been truer\r\nrealization of the words of the great bard--\r\n\r\n  \"The web of our life is of a mingled yarn,\r\n  Good and ill together?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\nTHE CODE OF HONOR\r\n\r\nBLADENSBURG, A PLACE NOTORIOUS FOR DUELS--FRANKLIN'S OPINION OF\r\nDUELLING--NOTABLE MEN WHO FELL IN DUELS--FATAL DUEL BETWEEN COMMODORES\r\nBARRON AND DECATUR--THE LAST DUEL FOUGHT AT BLADENSBURG--ITS CAUSE A\r\nMERE PUNCTILIO--THE WRITER'S INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF THE SECONDS--\r\nA DUEL IN REVOLUTION DAYS--GEORGE WASHINGTON DISSUADES GEN.

It is associated with tragic events\r\nthat during successive generations stirred emotions of indignation\r\nand horror that have not yet wholly died out from the memories\r\nof men.  As the words \"Baden-Baden\" and \"Monte Carlo\" bring before\r\nus the gambler \"steeped in the colors of his trade,\" so the mere\r\nmention of Bladensburg calls to mind the duellist, pistol in hand,\r\nstanding in front of his slain antagonist.\r\n\r\nPersonal difficulties are now rarely if ever in this country adjusted\r\nby an appeal to \"the code.\"  The custom, now universally condemned\r\nas barbarous, was at an early day practically upheld by an\r\nalmost omnipotent public opinion.  As is well known, in many\r\nlocalities to have declined an invitation to \"the field of honor\" from\r\none entitled to the designation of a \"gentleman\" would have entailed\r\nnot only loss of social position, but to a public man would have\r\nbeen a bar to future political advancement.  Thanks to a higher\r\ncivilization, and possibly a more exalted estimate of the sacredness\r\nof human life, the code in all our American States is a thing of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, revolting as the custom now appears, it held its place as\r\na recognized method for the settlement of personal controversies\r\namong \"gentlemen,\" to a time within the memories of men still\r\nliving.  The code, a heritage from barbaric times, lingered till\r\nit had caused more than one bloody chapter to be written, until it\r\nhad taken from the walks of life more than one of our most\r\ngifted American statesmen.\r\n\r\nTruer words were never written than those of Franklin at the\r\ntime when the code was appealed to for the settlement of every\r\ndispute pertaining to personal honor:  \"A duel decides nothing;\r\nthe man appealing to it, makes himself judge in his own cause,\r\ncondemns the offender without a jury, and undertakes himself to be\r\nthe executioner.\"  And yet, the startling record remains that in\r\nthe State of New Jersey, one of the ablest and most brilliant of\r\nstatesmen met death at the hands of an antagonist scarcely less\r\ngifted, who was at the time Vice-President of the United States.\r\nThe survivor of an encounter equally tragic, occurring near the\r\nbanks of the Cumberland in 1806, was a little more than a score of\r\nyears later elevated to the Presidency.  The valuable life of\r\nthe Secretary of State during the administration of the younger\r\nAdams was saved only by his antagonist magnanimously refusing to\r\nreturn the fire which came within an ace of ending his own life.\r\nThirteen years after the Clay and Randolph duel, a member of Congress\r\nfrom Maine perished in an encounter at Bladensburg with a\r\nrepresentative from Kentucky.  Sixty-six years ago, a challenge to\r\nmortal combat was accepted by one who in later years was twice\r\nelected to the Presidency.  One of the signers of the Declaration\r\nof Independence fell in a duel with an officer of the Colonial\r\narmy, soon after that great event.  There are many yet living\r\nwho read the startling telegram from the Pacific coast that a\r\nSenator from California had fallen in a duel with the Chief Justice\r\nof that State, and sad as it is, this dreadful recital might be\r\nmuch farther extended.\r\n\r\nWhile a member of Congress many years ago, in company with\r\nRepresentatives Knott and McKenzie of Kentucky I spent some hours upon\r\nthe historic duelling ground at Bladensburg, a Maryland village of\r\na few hundred inhabitants, six miles from the city of Washington.\r\nGovernor Knott pointed out the exact spot where Barron and Decatur\r\nstood in the memorable duel in 1820, in which the latter was killed.\r\nIt is impossible to read the account of this fatal meeting even\r\nafter the lapse of more than four score years, without a feeling\r\nof profound regret for the sad fate of one of the most gallant\r\nof all the brave officers the American Navy has known.  It was\r\ntruly said of Decatur:  \"He was one of the most chivalric men of\r\nany age or country.\"  He was one of the little band of naval\r\ncommanders who by heroic exploits at sea did so much to redeem the\r\nAmerican name from the humiliation and disgrace caused by incompetent\r\ngeneralship upon land, in our second war with Great Britain.\r\nHis encounters with the enemy were of frequent occurrence, and\r\nin each instance added new laurels to our little navy.  If Commodore\r\nDecatur had rendered no other service to his country, that of the\r\ndestruction of the Algerine pirates would alone entitle him to a\r\nplace among its benefactors.  His skill and daring when in command\r\nof our little fleet upon the Mediterranean destroyed forever the\r\npower of \"the common enemy of mankind,\" avenged the insult to\r\nour flag, and secured for the American name an honored place among\r\nthe nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe tragic death of Decatur--recalling so much of gallant service--\r\nhas cast a spell about his name.  It belongs in the list of immortals,\r\nwith the names of Sir Walter Raleigh, Captain Lawrence, Lord Nelson,\r\nand Oliver Hazard Perry.  Cities and counties without number\r\nthroughout our entire country have been given the honored name\r\nof Decatur.\r\n\r\nCommodore Barron, too, had known much active service.  For an\r\nalleged official delinquency, he had been court-martialed near the\r\nclose of the War of 1812, and sentenced to a suspension of five\r\nyears from his command.  Smarting under this humiliation, he was\r\nbitter in his denunciation of all who were in any way concerned in\r\nwhat he regarded an act of flagrant injustice to himself.  Chief\r\namong the officers who had incurred his displeasure was Commodore Decatur.\r\nA protracted and at length hostile correspondence ensued between the\r\ntwo, and this correspondence resulted at length in a challenge from\r\nBarron, accepted by Decatur.  The latter had repeatedly declared\r\nthat he bore no personal hostility toward Barron.  Before going to\r\nthe fatal field he told his friend William Wirt--then the\r\nAttorney-General of the United States--that he did not wish to meet\r\nBarron, and that the duel was forced upon him.  When he received\r\nthe challenge, he assured a brother officer that nothing could\r\ninduce him to take the life of Barron.  In connection with this\r\nsad affair, Mr. Wirt--who was untiring in his efforts to effect\r\na reconciliation--has left the record of a conversation with Decatur\r\nin which the latter declared his hostility to the practice of\r\nduelling, but that he was \"controlled by the omnipotence of public\r\nsentiment.\"  \"Fighting,\" said he, \"is my profession, and it would be\r\nimpossible for me to keep my station and preserve my respectability\r\nwithout showing myself ready at all times to answer the call of\r\nany one who bore the name of gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nThe hostile meeting between Barron and Decatur occurred at the\r\nplace already mentioned, March 22, 1820.  The distance was eight\r\npaces, the weapons, pistols.  Decatur's second was Captain Bainbridge,\r\nat a later day a distinguished admiral in our navy.  As they\r\ntook their places at the deadly range, Barron said, \"I hope on\r\nmeeting in another world we will be better friends than in this.\"\r\nTo which Decatur replied, \"I have never been your enemy, sir.\"  At\r\nthe word both pistols were discharged, making but a single report.\r\nBoth combatants fell.  Decatur was supported a short distance, and\r\nsank down near his antagonist, who was severely--and as it was then\r\nsupposed, mortally--wounded.  Mr. Wirt says:\r\n\r\n\"What then occurred reminded me of the closing scenes of the tragedy\r\nbetween Hamlet and Laertes.  Barron proposed that they should make\r\nfriends before they met in another world.  Decatur said he had\r\nnever been his enemy, that he freely forgave him his death, but he\r\ncould not forgive those who had stimulated him to seek his life.\r\nBarron then said:  'Would to God you had said that much yesterday.'\"\r\n\r\nThus they parted in peace.  Decatur knew he was to die, and his\r\nonly regret was that he had not died in the service of his country.\r\n\r\nThe last duel fought at Bladensburg was in 1838, between Jonathan Cilley\r\nand William J. Graves.  The former was at the time a Representative\r\nin Congress from Maine, and the latter from Kentucky.  In its main\r\nfeatures, this duel is without a parallel.  It was fought upon a\r\npure technicality.  The parties to it never exchanged an unkind\r\nword, and were in fact, almost up to the day of the fatal meeting,\r\ncomparative strangers to each other.\r\n\r\nBriefly related, the fatal meeting between Cilley and Graves\r\ncame about in this wise.  In a speech in the House, Mr. Cilley\r\nin replying to an editorial in _The New York Courier and Inquirer,_\r\ncriticised severely the conduct of its proprietor, James Watson\r\nWebb, a noted Whig editor of that day.  At this, the latter, being\r\ndeeply offended and failing to obtain a retraction by Cilley of\r\nthe offensive words, challenged him to mortal combat.  The bearer of\r\nthis challenge was William J. Graves, a prominent Whig member of\r\nthe House.  Mr. Cilley in his letter to Mr. Graves, in which he\r\ndeclined to receive the challenge of Webb, said:  \"I decline to\r\nreceive it because I choose to be drawn into no controversy with\r\nhim.  I neither affirm nor deny anything in regard to his character,\r\nbut I now repeat what I have said to you, that I intended by the\r\nrefusal no disrespect to you.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was considered unsatisfactory by Graves, and he\r\nimmediately sent by his colleague Mr. Menifee, a note to Cilley\r\nthen in his seat in the House, saying:  \"In declining to receive\r\nColonel Webb's communication, you do not disclaim any exception to\r\nhim personally as a gentleman.  I have, therefore, to inquire\r\nwhether you declined to receive his communication on the ground of\r\nany personal exception to him as a gentleman or a man of honor.\"\r\nMr. Cilley declining to give the categorical answer demanded, was\r\nimmediately challenged by Graves.  The challenge was borne by\r\nMr. Wise, a Representative from Virginia.  On the same evening,\r\nMr. Jones--then a delegate and later a Senator from Iowa--as the\r\nsecond of Cilley, handed the note of acceptance of the latter to\r\nGraves.  Bladensburg was designated as the place of meeting, rifles\r\nthe weapons, the distance eight yards, the rifles to be held\r\nhorizontally at arm's length down, to be cocked and triggers set, the\r\nwords to be, \"Gentlemen, are you ready?\"  Some delay was occasioned\r\nby the difficulty in procuring a suitable rifle for Mr. Graves.\r\nThis was at length obviated, as will appear from the following note\r\nof Mr. Jones to Mr. Wise:  \"I have the honor to inform you that\r\nI have in my possession an excellent rifle, in good order, which\r\nis at the service of Mr. Graves.\"  With every courtesy proper to\r\nthe occasion rigidly observed, the rifle mentioned, \"through the\r\npoliteness of Dr. Duncan,\" was sent to Mr. Graves, and the hostile\r\nmeeting occurred at the designated time, February 24, 1838.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of a special committee of the House of Representatives\r\nat a later day appointed to investigate this affair, it appears\r\nthat Mr. Graves was accompanied to the ground by his second, Mr.\r\nWise, Mr. Crittenden, and Mr. Menifee, two of his colleagues,\r\nand Dr. Foltz his surgeon.  The attendants of Mr. Cilley were\r\nhis second, Mr. Jones, Representative Bynum of North Carolina, and\r\nColonel Schoenberg, and Dr. Duncan as his surgeon.  The Committee's\r\nreport then continues in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after three o'clock P. M. the parties exchanged shots\r\naccording to the terms of meeting.  Mr. Cilley fired first before\r\nhe had fully elevated his piece, and Mr. Graves one or two seconds\r\nafterwards.  Both missed.  It is to the credit of both the seconds\r\nand to the other gentlemen in attendance, than an earnest desire\r\nwas then manifested to have the affair terminated, as will appear from\r\nthe report already mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jones now inquired of Mr. Wise whether Mr. Graves was satisfied,\r\nto which Mr. Wise replied:  \"These gentlemen have come here without\r\nanimosity toward each other; they are fighting merely upon a point\r\nof honor.  Cannot Mr. Cilley assign some reason for not receiving at\r\nMr. Graves's hands Colonel Webb's communication, or make some\r\ndisclaimer which will relive Mr. Graves from his position?\"  Mr.\r\nJones replied:  \"While the challenge is impending, Mr. Cilley can\r\nmake no explanation.\"  Mr. Wise said:  \"The exchange of shots\r\nsuspends the challenge, and the challenge is suspended for\r\nexplanation.\"  Mr. Jones thereupon went to Mr. Cilley, and after\r\nreturning said:\r\n\r\n\"I am authorized by my friend Mr. Cilley to say, that in declining\r\nto receive the note from Mr. Graves purporting to come from Colonel\r\nWebb, he meant no disrespect to Mr. Graves because he entertained for\r\nhim then as he does now, the highest respect and the most kind\r\nfeeling; but that he declined to receive the note because he chose\r\nnot to be drawn into any controversy with Colonel Webb.\"\r\n\r\nThe above not being satisfactory to Mr. Graves, and Mr. Cilley\r\ndeclining to make further concession, the challenge was renewed\r\nand the parties resumed their positions and again exchanged shots.\r\nMr. Graves fired first, before he had fully elevated his piece;\r\nMr. Cilley about two seconds afterwards.  They both missed, although\r\nthe witnesses then thought from the motions and appearance of\r\nMr. Graves that he was hit.  The latter immediately and peremptorily\r\ndemanded another shot.\r\n\r\nThe challenge was here again, for the time, withdrawn and\r\nanother unsuccessful attempt made by the seconds to effect an\r\nadjustment.  In the light of what was so soon to follow, it is\r\npainful to read that all this came about and continued to the bloody\r\nend, because Mr. Cilley in substance refused to disclaim that\r\nhis declination of Webb's challenge was for the reason that he did\r\nnot consider him a gentleman.  His repeated assurance that in doing\r\nso, he intended no disrespect to the bearer of the challenge,\r\nfor whom he entertained the most kindly feelings, strangely enough\r\nto us was deemed insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe challenge being renewed, the parties, after due observance\r\nof the formalities as before, confronted each other for the third and\r\nlast time.  And now closes the official report:  \"the rifles being\r\nloaded, the parties resumed their stations, and fired the third\r\ntime very near together.  Mr. Cilley was shot through the body.\r\nHe dropped his rifle, beckoned to some one near him, and said,\r\n'I am shot,' put both his hands to his wound, fell, and in two\r\nor three minutes expired.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a commentary all this upon \"the code of honor\"!  Upon what\r\nappears the shadow of a technicality even, two young men of recognized\r\nability, chosen representatives of the people, confronted each\r\nother in continued combat, until death closed the scene, and neither\r\nhad the slightest feeling of hostility toward the other!  This\r\nduel, so utterly groundless in its inception and bloody in its\r\ntermination, was the last fought in Bladensburg.  Intense excitement\r\nfollowed the death of the lamented Cilley and public sentiment was\r\ndeeply aroused against the horrible custom of duelling.  But the\r\npublic sentiment that existed at the time must be taken into account\r\nbefore a too ready condemnation of one of the actors in this fearful\r\ntragedy.  In announcing the death of Mr. Cilley to the Senate, Mr.\r\nWilliams of Maine said:  \"In accepting the call, he did nothing\r\nmore than he believed indispensable to avoid disgrace to himself, his\r\nfamily, and his constituents.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the presiding officer of the Senate, a gentleman of small\r\nstature and advanced age called upon me and introduced himself\r\nas George W. Jones, former Senator from Iowa.  I have rarely met\r\na more interesting man.  He was then ninety-two years of age,\r\napparently in perfect health, and as active as if, for his exclusive\r\nbenefit, the hands had been turned back three decades upon the\r\ndial.  He had been a delegate from the Territory embracing the\r\npresent States of Iowa and Wisconsin, in the twenty-fifth Congress,\r\nwhen the sessions of the House were held in the Old Hall.  Upon the\r\nadmission of Iowa as a State, he was chosen a Senator, a position he\r\nheld by successive elections for many years.  As delegate, he\r\nhad been the associate of John Quincy Adams, and as a Senator\r\nthe contemporary of Benton, Wright, Douglas, Cass, Seward, Preston,\r\nClay, Calhoun, and Webster.  He had personally known some of the\r\nmen whose public life reached back to the establishment of the\r\nGovernment.  He had taken part in the discussion of great questions\r\nthat have left a deep impress upon history.  As I listened to his\r\ndescription of the men I have named, and of the momentous events\r\nwith which their names are associated, he seemed indeed the sole\r\nconnecting link between the present and the long past.\r\n\r\nBut what interested me most deeply in the almost forgotten old man\r\nbefore me, was the fact that he was the second of the unfortunate Cilley\r\nupon the ill-fated day at Bladensburg.  The conversation at length\r\nturned to that event, and strangely enough, he manifested no\r\nsuggestion of embarrassment at its mention.  He spoke in the highest\r\nterms of Mr. Cilley, as a gentleman of lofty character, of unfaltering\r\ncourage, of rare gifts, and of splendid promise.  It was evident\r\nthat the passing years had not dimmed his memory of the tragic\r\nevent, nor lessened his regret at the sad ending of an affair with\r\nwhich his own name is inseparably associated.\r\n\r\nThe first duel between men of prominence in this country, was that\r\nof Gwinett and McIntosh.  The fact that one of the parties, Button\r\nGwinett, was a signer of the Declaration of Independence gives\r\nit historic interest.  He was one of the three delegates from\r\nGeorgia in the second Continental Congress, and an earnest champion\r\nof independence.  Six years before, he had emigrated from England,\r\npurchased a large tract of land, and devoted himself to agricultural\r\npursuits.  Less is known of him, probably, than of any of the\r\nsigners of the Declaration.\r\n\r\nIn 1777, he became involved in a bitter personal quarrel with\r\nGeneral McIntosh, an officer of the Revolution.  Deeply offended\r\nat his conduct, Gwinett challenged him to mortal combat.  They\r\nfought with pistols at a distance of twelve feet, and Gwinett\r\nwas killed.  He is buried at Augusta, Georgia, with his two colleagues\r\nin the Continental Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is now an almost forgotten fact that, but for the wise counsel of\r\nhis superior officer, Nathaniel Greene, next to Washington the\r\nablest of the American generals, would have been a party to a duel\r\nat a time when his services were so greatly in demand.  Soon after\r\nhis transfer to the southern army, Greene was challenged by a\r\ncaptain of his command.  Fearing that a declination upon his\r\npart would be misunderstood by his brother officers, Greene\r\nwrote General Washington a full account of the transaction,\r\nconcluding:  \"If I thought my honor or reputation would suffer\r\nin the opinion of the world, and more especially with the military\r\ngentlemen, I value life too little to hesitate a moment to\r\naccept the challenge.\"  The answer of one of the wisest of men\r\npossibly saved to our little army one whose loss would have been\r\ndisastrous to his country at that critical moment.  Said Washington:\r\n\r\n\"I give it as my decided opinion, that your honor and reputation\r\nwill stand not only perfectly acquitted for the non-acceptance\r\nof his challenge, but that your prudence and judgment would have\r\nbeen condemned by accepting it; because if a commanding officer is\r\namenable to private calls for the discharge of his public duty, he\r\nhas a dagger always at his heart, and can turn neither to the right\r\nnor to the left without meeting its point.\"\r\n\r\nThe timely words of Washington had the desired effect, and very\r\nprobably saved General Greene to a brilliant career of usefulness and\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting incidents of our Revolutionary history,\r\nis what is known as \"The Conway Cabal,\" the attempt to displace\r\nWashington from the supreme command and substitute General Horatio\r\nGates in his stead.  The latter was then in high favor as the hero\r\nof Saratoga and the capturer of the invading army of Burgoyne.  In\r\nthis connection, the prophetic words of the deeply embittered\r\nGeneral Charles Lee will be recalled.  On his way to take command of\r\nthe southern army to which he had just been assigned, Gates called\r\nupon Lee, then in disgrace and retirement at his home.  Both\r\nwere Englishmen, had known service together in the British army,\r\nand were at the time owners of neighboring plantations in what\r\nis now Jefferson County, West Virginia.  When parting, Lee\r\nsignificantly remarked to this old comrade, \"Gates, your\r\nNorthern laurels will soon be turned into Southern willows.\"\r\nThe disastrous defeat at Camden soon thereafter terminated the\r\nmilitary career of Gates no less effectually than the timely \"curse\"\r\nof Washington had terminated that of Lee upon his disgraceful\r\nretreat at the battle of Monmouth.\r\n\r\nThe result of the \"Cabal\" above mentioned was a challenge from\r\nColonel Cadwallader to General Conway, whose name has come down to\r\nus associated with the conspiracy to supersede Washington by Gates.\r\nIn an encounter which immediately followed, Conway was seriously\r\nwounded.  Believing his wound to be mortal, he called for pen\r\nand paper and did much to retrieve his reputation by writing the\r\nfollowing letter to Washington:\r\n\r\n\"SIR:  I find myself just able to hold my pen during a few moments\r\nand take this opportunity of expressing my sincere grief for having\r\nwritten, said, or done anything disagreeable to Your Excellency.\r\nMy career will soon be over, therefore justice and truth prompt me\r\nto declare my last sentiments.  You are in my eyes the great and\r\ngood man.  May you long enjoy the love, esteem, and veneration\r\nof these States whose liberties you have asserted by your virtues.\"\r\n\r\nConway eventually recovered, entered the army of France, and died in\r\nits service.\r\n\r\nGeneral Charles Lee was indeed a soldier of fortune.  A native\r\nof England, he held a commission in the British army, and later in\r\nthat of the King of Italy.  As the result of a duel in which he\r\nslew an Italian officer, he fled to America, and tendered his\r\nservices to the Continental Congress just at the beginning of\r\nthe struggle for independence.  He was placed second in command to\r\nWashington and was not without supporters for the coveted position\r\nof Commander-in-chief.  He was from the beginning the enemy of\r\nWashington, and deeply resented the fact that his position was\r\nsubordinate to that of the younger and less experienced officer,\r\nfor whose ability he expressed great contempt.  He was a friend of\r\nGates and one of the chief conspirators in the Conway Cabal.  His\r\nmilitary career closed at the battle of Monmouth, and from letters\r\nthat have come to light there is little doubt that he was then\r\nin treasonable correspondence with the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter being deprived of his command at Monmouth, he was challenged\r\nby Colonel John Laurens, one of the aides of the Commander-in-chief,\r\nbecause of his denunciation of Washington.  The challenge was\r\naccepted, and the parties fought with pistols in a retired spot\r\nnear Philadelphia.  Additional interest attaches to this duel from\r\nthe fact that Colonel Alexander Hamilton of Washington's staff,\r\nwas the second for Laurens.\r\n\r\nAt the first fire Lee was wounded, and then, through the interposition\r\nof Hamilton the affair terminated.  The gratifying narrative has\r\ncome down to us that, \"upon the whole, we think it a piece of\r\njustice to the two gentlemen to declare that, after they met, their\r\nconduct was strongly marked with all the politeness, generosity,\r\ncoolness, and firmness, that ought to characterize a transaction\r\nof this nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe last years of Lee's life were spent at his Virginia plantation.\r\nHe died in an obscure boarding-house in Philadelphia, in 1782.\r\nUpon a visit I made to his Virginia home some years ago, I was\r\nshown a certified copy of his will, which contained this remarkable\r\nprovision:\r\n\r\n\"It is my will, that I shall not be buried within one mile of\r\nany churchyard, or of any Presbyterian or Anabaptist church, for\r\nthe reason that _as I have kept a great deal of bad company in this\r\nworld, I do not wish to do so in the next.\"_\r\n\r\nThis country has known few abler or more eminent men than DeWitt\r\nClinton.  He was successively Mayor of the city of New York, Governor\r\nof that State, a Senator in Congress, and in 1812 an unsuccessful\r\ncandidate for the Presidency against Mr. Madison.  Distinguished as a\r\nlawyer and statesman, he is even better known as \"the Father of the\r\nErie Canal.\"  His biographer says:\r\n\r\n\"After undergoing constant, unremitting, and factious resistance, he\r\nhad the felicity of being borne, in October, 1825, in a barge on\r\nthe artificial river--which he seemed to all to have constructed\r\n--from Lake Erie to the Bay of New York, while bells were rung,\r\nand cannon saluted him at every stage of that imposing progress.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1803, while in the Senate, Clinton accepted a challenge from\r\nGeneral Dayton, a Senator from New Jersey.  The ground of the\r\nchallenge was words spoken by the former in debate.  Before the\r\nhostile meeting, however, through the interposition of friends a\r\nsatisfactory explanation upon the part of Clinton resulted in a\r\npeaceable adjustment, and the restoration of friendly relations\r\nbetween the two Senators.\r\n\r\nAn \"affair of honor\" in which Clinton was engaged one year earlier,\r\nwas not quite so easily adjusted.  This was with a noted politician\r\nof that day, John Swartout of New York.  The latter was the friend\r\nof Aaron Burr, the political and personal enemy of Clinton.  Swartout\r\nwas the challenging party, and the hostile meeting occurred near\r\nthe city of New York.  On the ground, after the parties had been\r\nplaced in position, Clinton is said to have expressed regret\r\nthat Burr--the real principal in the controversy--was not before\r\nhim.  History might have run in a different channel had such been the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThree pistol shots were exchanged without effect, at the end of\r\neach the second of Clinton demanding of Swartout, \"Are you satisfied,\r\nsir?\" to which the answer was, \"I am not.\"  To this, at the\r\nthird exchange, was added, \"neither shall I be until that apology is\r\nmade which I have demanded of Mr. Clinton.\"  Mr. Clinton declined to\r\nsign a paper presented, but declared that he had no animosity\r\nagainst Mr. Swartout, and would willingly shake hands and agree to\r\nmeet on the score of former friendship.  This being unsatisfactory,\r\nthe fourth shot was promptly exchanged.  Fortune, heretofore\r\nreluctant to decide between her favorites, now leaned toward the\r\nchallenged party--Mr. Swartout being struck just below the knee.\r\nIn reply to the inquiry, \"Are you satisfied, sir?\" standing\r\nerect while the surgeon kneeling beside him removed the ball, he\r\nanswered, \"I am not; _proceed.\"_  The fifth shot being exchanged, Mr.\r\nSwartout's other leg was the recipient of his antagonist's bullet.\r\nThe voice of the wounded man being still for war, Mr. Clinton here\r\nthrew down his pistol, declaring he would fight no longer, and\r\nimmediately retired from the ground.  The second of the remaining\r\nbelligerent now advised his principal to retire also and have his\r\nwounds dressed, which certainly seemed reasonable under all the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAn answer to a challenge that might well stand for a model for all\r\ntime, was that given during the administration of the older Adams by\r\nMr. Thatcher of Massachusetts, to Blount of North Carolina.  The\r\nchallenge grew out of a heated debate in the House.  In reply,\r\nThatcher said in substance, that being a husband and father, his\r\nfamily had an interest in his life, and that he could not think of\r\naccepting the invitation without the consent of his wife, that\r\nhe would immediately consult her, and _if successful in obtaining her\r\npermission,_ he would meet Mr. Blount with pleasure.  Whereupon\r\nFisher Ames, one of the great men of the day, wittily remarked to a\r\nbachelor colleague, \"Behold now the advantage of having a wife--\r\nGod preserve us all from gunpowder!\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of Thatcher was read in the House, causing much merriment\r\nand leaving his adversary--\r\n\r\n  \"Sacred to ridicule his whole life long,\r\n  And the sad burden of some merry song.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add that at last accounts the consent of\r\nMrs. Thatcher had not been obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely remembered that Lord Byron, angered by a bitter\r\ncriticism, once challenged the poet Southey.  Accepting the challenge\r\nconditionally, Southey added:\r\n\r\n\"In affairs of this kind, the participants ought to meet on\r\nequal terms.  But to establish the equality between you and me\r\nthere are two things that ought to be done, and a third may also be\r\nnecessary before I meet you on the field.  First, you must marry\r\nand have four children--all girls.  Second, you must prove that\r\nthe greater part of the provision which you make for them depends upon\r\nyou life, and you must be under bond for four thousand pounds not to\r\nbe hanged, commit suicide, nor be killed in a duel, which are\r\nthe conditions upon which I have insured my life for the benefit\r\nof my wife and daughters.  Third, you must convert me to infidelity.\r\nWe can then meet on equal terms, _and your challenge will be\r\ncheerfully accepted.\"_\r\n\r\nSince the writing of the letters of Junius, nothing probably has\r\nappeared equal in invective to the correspondence seventy years\r\nago between Daniel O'Connell and Benjamin Disraeli.  The former\r\nwas at the time a distinguished member of Parliament, and an orator\r\nwithout a peer.  Disraeli, at first a supporter of the policy of\r\nthe great Liberator, had joined the ranks of his enemies, and\r\nwas unsparing in his denunciation of O'Connell and his party.\r\nIn his reply O'Connell, after charging his assailant with ingratitude\r\nand treachery, concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot divest my mind of the belief that if your genealogy were\r\ntraced, it would be found that you are the lineal descendant and\r\ntrue heir-at-law of the impenitent thief who atoned for his crimes\r\nupon the cross.\"\r\n\r\nThe challenge from Disraeli, which immediately followed, was treated\r\nby O'Connell with supreme contempt.\r\n\r\nThe duel between Hamilton and Burr is of perennial interest to the\r\nAmerican people.  Both were men of great distinction and\r\nsplendid talents.  Both had been soldiers during the Revolutionary\r\nWar, and Hamilton was the confidential friend and for a time\r\nchief-of-staff of Washington.  Burr had been a Senator from New\r\nYork, and was at the time of the duel Vice-President of the United\r\nStates.  He was one of the recognized leaders of the dominant party,\r\nand by many considered the probable successor of Jefferson in\r\nthe great office.  Whatever hopes he might have had for the Presidency\r\nwere destroyed by his alleged attempt to defeat Jefferson and secure\r\nhis own elevation by the House of Representatives in 1801.  His\r\nhostility to Hamilton had its beginning in the opposition of the\r\nlatter to Burr's aspirations to the Presidency.  Differing widely,\r\nas Hamilton did, with Jefferson upon important questions then\r\npending, he nevertheless preferred the latter to Burr, and his\r\ninfluence eventually turned the scales--after a protracted struggle\r\n--in favor of Jefferson.\r\n\r\nThe valuable service just mentioned was one of the many rendered\r\nby Hamilton.  He was the earnest advocate of the adoption of the\r\nFederal Constitution, and his papers during that pivotal struggle have\r\njustly given him high place in the list of American statesmen.  He\r\nwas the first Secretary of the Treasury, and possibly no man\r\npossessed in larger degree the confidence of Washington.\r\n\r\nAaron Burr was the grandson of the great New England minister,\r\nJonathan Edwards, whose only daughter, Edith, was the wife of\r\nthe Reverend Aaron Burr, an eminent Presbyterian clergyman and\r\nPresident of Princeton College.  From all that is known of this\r\ngentleman, there can be no doubt that his ability and piety were\r\nunquestioned.  Edith, his wife, was a woman of rare gifts and one of\r\nthe loveliest of her sex.  The pathetic reference to her in the\r\nfuneral sermon over Hamilton will be remembered:  \"If there be tears\r\nin Heaven, a pious mother looks down upon this scene and weeps.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton and Burr were both citizens of New York, the latter, of\r\nAlbany, the former, of New York City.  At the time of the challenge\r\nHamilton held no public office, but was engaged in a lucrative\r\npractice of the law.  Burr was near the expiration of his term\r\nas Vice-President, and was a prospective candidate for Governor of\r\nNew York.  This candidacy was the immediate cause of the correspondence\r\nwhich resulted in the fatal encounter.  Four letters passed between\r\nBurr and Hamilton prior to the formal challenge.  The first was\r\nfrom Burr, and bears date June 18, 1804.  In it attention is directed\r\nto a published letter of Dr. Cooper containing the words, \"General\r\nHamilton and Judge Kent have declared in substance that they\r\nlook upon Mr. Burr to be a dangerous man, and one who ought not to\r\nbe trusted with the reins of government.  And I could detail to you\r\na still more deplorable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed\r\nof Mr. Burr.\"\r\n\r\nIt was to the last sentence that the attention of Hamilton was\r\nespecially directed by Mr. Van Ness, the bearer of the letter,\r\nwhich closed with the demand upon the part of Burr of \"a prompt\r\nand unqualified acknowledgment or denial, of the use of any expression\r\nwhich would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper.\"\r\n\r\nIn his reply the next day Hamilton said:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot reconcile it with propriety to make the acknowledgment\r\nor denial you desire.  I will add that I deem it inadmissable on\r\nprinciple to consent to be interrogated as to the justness of\r\nthe inferences which may be drawn from others, from whatever I may\r\nhave said of a political opponent in the course of fifteen\r\nyears' competition.  I stand ready to avow, or disavow promptly\r\nand explicitly, any precise or definite opinion which I may be\r\ncharged with having declared of any gentleman.  More than this\r\ncannot be fitly expected from me; and especially it cannot be\r\nreasonably expected that I shall enter into an explanation upon\r\na basis so vague as that which you have adopted.  I trust on\r\nmore reflection, you will see the matter in the same light with\r\nme.  If not, I can only regret the circumstance, and must abide\r\nthe consequences.\"\r\n\r\nThe immediate response of Burr to the above, after repeating his\r\nformer demand, contained the following:\r\n\r\n\"Political opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity\r\nof a rigid adherence to the laws of honor and the rules of decorum.\r\nI neither claim such privilege, nor indulge it in others.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton's reply being unsatisfactory, the formal challenge of Burr\r\nwas soon thereafter handed to him by W. P. Van Ness.  The last\r\nnamed was the second of Burr, and Nathaniel Pendleton was the friend\r\nof Hamilton.\r\n\r\nSome days elapsed after the formal acceptance of the challenge\r\nbefore the fatal meeting.  That Hamilton was anxious to avoid\r\nthe conflict, clearly appears from a perusal of the many publications\r\nthat immediately followed.  A paper he prepared explanatory in\r\ncharacter, the second of Burr declined to receive, on the ground\r\nthat he considered the correspondence closed by the acceptance\r\nof the challenge.\r\n\r\nIt touches our sympathies deeply even after the lapse of a century\r\nto read the letter written by Hamilton to his wife to be delivered\r\nin the event of his death, in which he states that he has endeavored\r\nby all honorable means to avoid the duel which probably he would\r\nnot survive.  He begs her forgiveness for the pain his death would\r\ncause her, and entreats her to bear her sorrows as one who has\r\nplaced a firm reliance on a kind Providence.\r\n\r\nA few days before his death, he and Burr were guests at a dimmer\r\ngiven by the Cincinnati Society, of which both were members.\r\nFew persons were aware of what was pending, but it was observed\r\nthat Hamilton \"entered with glee into all the gayety of a convivial\r\nparty, and even sang an old military song.\"  Burr, upon the contrary,\r\nwas \"silent, gloomy, and remained apart.\"\r\n\r\nIn his will, written July 9, Hamilton expressed deep regret that\r\nhis death will prevent the full payment of his debts.  He expresses\r\nthe hope that his children will, in time, make up to his creditors\r\nall that may be due them.  After tenderly committing to his children\r\nthe care of their mother, he says, \"in all situations you are\r\ncharged to bear in mind, that she has been to you the most devoted\r\nand best of mothers.\"\r\n\r\nThe last paper that came from his pen was evidently intended as\r\nhis vindication to posterity, his appeal to time.  In this he says:\r\n\r\n\"I was certainly desirous of avoiding this interview, for the most\r\ncogent reasons.  My religious and moral principles are strongly\r\nopposed to duelling, and it would give me pain to be obliged to\r\nshed the blood of a fellow-creature in a private combat forbidden by\r\nthe laws.  My wife and children are extremely dear to me, and my\r\nlife is of the utmost importance to them.  I am conscious of no\r\nill-will to Colonel Burr distinct from political opposition, which\r\nI trust has proceeded from pure and upright motives.  Lastly, I\r\nshall hazard much and shall possibly gain nothing by the issue\r\nof the interview.  But it was impossible for me to avoid it.\"\r\n\r\nHe candidly admits that his criticisms of Colonel Burr have been\r\nsevere.  He says:\r\n\r\n\"And on different occasions, I--in common with many others--have\r\nmade very unfavorable criticisms of the private character of\r\nthis gentleman.  It is not my design to fix any odium on the conduct\r\nof Colonel Burr in this case.  He may have supposed himself under the\r\nnecessity of acting as he has done.  I hope the grounds of his\r\nproceeding have been such as to satisfy his own conscience.  I\r\ntrust, at the same time, that the world will do me the justice\r\nto believe that I have not censured him on light grounds, nor from\r\nunworthy inducements.\"\r\n\r\nHow strangely in the light of history sounds the following:  \"It\r\nis my ardent wish that he, by his future conduct, may show himself\r\nworthy of all confidence and esteem, and prove an ornament and\r\nblessing to the country.\"\r\n\r\nThat some lingering apprehension existed in the mind of General\r\nHamilton that his criticisms of Colonel Burr might not have been\r\naltogether generous, appears from the following:\r\n\r\n\"As well because it is possible that I may have injured Colonel\r\nBurr, however convinced myself that my opinions and declarations\r\nhave been well-founded, as from my general principles and temper\r\nin relation to similar affairs, I have resolved, if our interview is\r\nconducted in the usual manner, and it please God to give me the\r\nopportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire; and I have\r\nthought even of reserving my second fire, and thus giving to Colonel\r\nBurr a double opportunity to pause and to reflect.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, before laying down his pen for the last time, he struck the\r\nkeynote to the conduct of many brave men who, like himself,\r\nreluctantly accepted a call to \"the field of honor.\"  These are\r\nhis closing words:\r\n\r\n\"To those who with me, abhorring the practice of duelling, may\r\nthink that I ought under no account to have added to the number of\r\nbad examples, I answer, that my relative situation as well in public\r\nas in private enforcing all the considerations which constitute\r\nwhat men of the world denominate honor imposed on me a peculiar\r\nnecessity not to decline the call.  The ability to be in future\r\nuseful, whether in arresting mischief or effecting good in this\r\ncrisis of our public affairs which seemed likely to happen,\r\nwould probably be inseparable from a conformity with public prejudice\r\nin this particular.\"\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock in the morning of July 11, 1804, at Weehawken,\r\nNew Jersey, the fatal meeting took place.  After the usual\r\nformal salutation, the parties were placed in position by their\r\nseconds, ten paces apart, the pistols placed in their hands, and\r\nthe word being given both fired.  General Hamilton instantly fell.\r\nThe statement subsequently given out by the seconds is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Burr then advanced toward General Hamilton with a manner and\r\ngesture that appeared to be expressive of regret, but without\r\nspeaking turned about and withdrew, being urged from the field\r\nby his friends.  No further communication took place between the\r\nprincipals, and the barge that carried Colonel Burr immediately\r\nreturned to the city.  We conceive it proper to add that the conduct\r\nof the parties in this interview was perfectly proper as suited\r\nthe occasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon in attendance states that after Hamilton was borne\r\nto the barge he observed, \"Pendleton knows that I did not intend\r\nto fire at him.\"  As they approached the shore he said, \"Let\r\nMrs. Hamilton be immediately sent for; let the event be gradually broken\r\nto her, but give her hopes.\"  His physician adds:\r\n\r\n\"During the night his mind retained its usual strength and composure.\r\nThe great source of his anxiety seemed to be in his sympathy with his\r\nhalf-distracted wife and children.  'My beloved wife and children'\r\nwas his often used expression, but his fortitude triumphed over\r\nhis situation, dreadful as it was.  Once, indeed, at the sight\r\nof his children, seven in number, brought to his bedside together,\r\nhis utterance forsook him.  To his wife he said in a firm voice\r\nbut with a pathetic and impressive manner, 'Remember, my Eliza,\r\nthat you are a Christian.'  His words and the tone in which they\r\nwere uttered, will never be effaced from my memory.\"\r\n\r\nAfter indescribable agony, death came at two o'clock of the day\r\nsucceeding the duel.  Thus, at the age of forty-seven, perished\r\nAlexander Hamilton, a great man in any country or time.  Cities\r\nand counties bear his name in almost every American State.  The\r\nstory of his wondrous life and tragic death will never lose its\r\npathetic interest.  His unswerving devotion to the country of\r\nhis adoption, his untiring efforts in the establishment of the\r\nnational Government, and his friendship for Washington, which knew\r\nno abatement, have given Hamilton honored and enduring place in\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\nAs to Burr, the proverb found instant verification that \"in duels the\r\nvictor is always the victim.\"  Had he, instead of Hamilton, fallen\r\non that ill-fated July morning, how changed their possible places in\r\nhistory.  A halo has gathered about the name of Hamilton.  Monuments\r\nhave been erected to his memory, his statue has been given high\r\nplace in the Capitol.  The hour of his fall was that of his\r\nexaltation.\r\n\r\nThe self-same hour witnessed the ruin of his antagonist.  From the\r\nfatal field, unharmed in body, he turned away, henceforth to the\r\nfollowed by the execrations of his countrymen.  Past services were\r\nforgotten, brilliant talents availed nothing.  His desperate attempt\r\nto found a rival government by the partial dismemberment of the\r\none he had helped to establish was thwarted, and after years of\r\npoverty and misfortune abroad, he returned to die in neglect and\r\nobscurity in his own country.  As was truly said:  \"He was the last\r\nof his race; there was no kindred hand to smooth his couch, or wipe\r\nthe death-damp from his brow.  No banners drooped over his bier;\r\nno melancholy music floated upon the reluctant air.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Hamilton Spencer, one of the ablest of lawyers, gave me\r\nan interesting account of an interview he had with Colonel Burr in\r\nAlbany not long before his death.  Notwithstanding his advanced\r\nage, broken health, and ruined fortunes, he deeply impressed Mr.\r\nSpencer as a gentleman of most courteous manners, dignified bearing,\r\nand commanding presence such as he had rarely seen.\r\n\r\nThe one object of his love was his daughter, the beautiful Theodosia.\r\nHer devotion to her father increased with his accumulating misfortunes.\r\nThe ship in which she sailed from her home in Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, to meet him in New York, never reached its destination.\r\nIn all history, there are few pictures more pathetic than that\r\nof the gray-haired, friendless man, with faded cloak drawn closely\r\nabout him, day after day wandering alone by the seaside, anxiously\r\nawaiting the coming of the one being who loved him, the idolized\r\ndaughter whose requiem was even then being chanted by the waves.\r\n\r\nOne of the men I occasionally met in Washington was Joseph C.\r\nMcKibben, a former representative in Congress from the Pacific\r\ncoast.  He was thoroughly familiar with the history of California from\r\nits cession to the United States at the close of the Mexican War.\r\nHe had been an active participant in many of the stirring events\r\noccurring soon after the admission of the State into the Union.\r\n\r\n  \"Men, except in bad novels, are not all good, or all evil.\"\r\n\r\nColonel McKibben was the second of David C. Broderick in his\r\nduel with Judge Terry.  At the time of the duel, Broderick was a\r\nSenator of the United States, and Terry the Chief Justice of\r\nCalifornia.  The challenge given by Terry was promptly accepted.\r\nAs will be remembered, in the encounter which immediately followed,\r\nTerry escaped unhurt and Broderick was killed.\r\n\r\nI recall vividly the description given me of the meeting between\r\nthese men in that early Spring morning in 1859.  Both possessed\r\nunquestioned courage.  Their demeanor upon the field, as in deadly\r\nattitude they confronted each other a few paces apart, was that of\r\nabsolute fearlessness.  \"Each had set his life upon a cast, and\r\nwas ready to stand the hazard of the die.\"\r\n\r\nRarely have truer words been uttered than those of the gifted Baker\r\nover the dead body of Broderick:\r\n\r\n\"The code of honor is a delusion and a snare; it palters with\r\nthe hope of true courage, and binds it at the feet of crafty and\r\ncruel skill.  It surrounds its victim with the pomp and grace of\r\nthe procession, but leaves him bleeding on the altar.  It\r\nsubstitutes cold and deliberate preparedness for courage and manly\r\nimpulse, and arms the one to disarm the other.  It makes the mere\r\ntrick of the weapon superior to the noblest cause and the truest\r\ncourage.  Its pretence of equality is a lie; it is equal in all the\r\nform, it is unjust in all the substance.  The habitude of arms,\r\nthe early training, the frontier life, the border war, the sectional\r\ncustom, the life of leisure, all these are advantages which no\r\nnegotiations can neutralize, and which no courage can overcome.\r\nCode of honor!  It is a prostitution of the name, is an evasion of\r\nthe substance, and is a shield blazoned with the name of chivalry to\r\ncover the malignity of murder.\"\r\n\r\nThe tragic ending of the eventful career of Judge Terry, which\r\noccurred within the last decade, will be readily recalled.\r\nImmediately following his assault upon Justice Field at the railway\r\nstation in Lathrop, California, he was slain by a deputy United\r\nStates marshal.  The wife of Terry was at his side, and the scene that\r\nfollowed beggars description.\r\n\r\nThe name of Terry at once recalls the \"Vigilance Committee\" of\r\nearly San Francisco days.  The committee was composed largely of\r\nleading men of the \"law-and-order\" element of the city.  Robberies\r\nand murders were of nightly occurrence, and gamblers and criminals\r\nin many instances were the incumbents of the public offices.\r\nThe organization mentioned became an imperative necessity for\r\nthe protection of life and property.  The work of the committee\r\nconstitutes one of the bloodiest chapters of early Californian\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nNearly a third of a century ago, Colonel Thornton, a prominent\r\nlawyer of San Francisco, related to me an incident which he had\r\nwitnessed during the time the famous Vigilance Committee was in\r\ncomplete control.  A young lawyer, recently located in San Francisco,\r\nwas arrested for stabbing a well-known citizen who was at the time\r\none of the most active members of the Vigilance Committee.  The\r\nname of the lawyer was David S. Terry, at a later day Chief Justice\r\nof the State.  The dread tribunal was presided over by one of\r\nthe most courageous and best known citizens of the Pacific coast.\r\nAt a later day, his name was presented by his State to the National\r\nConvention of his party for nomination for the Vice-Presidency.\r\n\r\nWhen brought before the Vigilance Committee, the demeanor of Terry\r\nwas that of absolute fearlessness.  Standing erect and perfectly\r\nself-possessed, he listened to the ominous words of the president:\r\n\"Mr. Terry, you are charged with attempted murder; what have you\r\nto say?\"  Advancing a step nearer the committee \"organized to\r\nconvict,\" and in a tone that at once challenged the respect of all,\r\nTerry replied, \"If your Honor please, I recognize the jurisdiction\r\nof this court, and am ready for trial.\"  He then clearly established\r\nthe fact that his assault was in self-defence, and after a masterly\r\nspeech, delivered with as much self-possession as if a life other than\r\nhis own trembled in the balance, was duly acquitted.\r\n\r\nAnother California with whom I was personally acquainted, was\r\nWilliam M. Gwin.  He had long passed the allotted three score\r\nand ten when I first met him at the home of the late Senator Sharon.\r\nFew men have known so eventful a career.  He had been the\r\nprivate secretary of Andrew Jackson.  He knew well the public men of\r\nthat day, and related many interesting incidents of the stormy\r\nperiod of the latter years of Jackson's Presidency.  In his\r\nearly manhood Gwin was a member of Congress from Alabama.  At the\r\nclose of the Mexican War he removed to California, and upon the\r\nadmission of that State he and John C. Fremont were chosen its\r\nfirst Senators in Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring a ride with him, he pointed out to me the spot where he had\r\nfought a duel in early California days.  He was then a Senator,\r\nand his antagonist the Hon. J. W. McCorkle, a member of Congress.\r\nA card signed by their respective seconds appeared the day following,\r\nto the effect that after the exchange of three ineffectual shots\r\nbetween the Hon. William M. Gwin and the Hon. J. W. McCorkle, the\r\nfriends of the respective parties, having discovered that _their\r\nprincipals were fighting under a misapprehension of facts,_ mutually\r\nexplained to their respective principals how the misapprehension\r\nhad arisen.  As a result, Senator Gwin promptly denied the cause\r\nof provocation and Mr. McCorkle withdrew his offensive language\r\nuttered at the race-course, and expressed regret at having used it.\r\n\r\nTo a layman in these \"piping times of peace\" it would appear the\r\nmore reasonable course to have avoided \"a misapprehension of facts\"\r\nbefore even three ineffectual shots.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the great civil conflict, the fortunes of\r\nSenator Gwin were cast with the South, and at its close he became a\r\ncitizen of Mexico.  Maximilian was then Emperor, and one of his\r\nlast official acts was the creation of a Mexican Duke out of the\r\nsometime American Senator.  The glittering empire set up by Napoleon\r\nthe Third and upheld for a time by French bayonets, was even then,\r\nhowever, tottering to its fall.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving the Ducal coronet from the Imperial hand the\r\nself-expatriated American statesman might well have inquired,\r\n\r\n  \"But shall we wear these glories for a day,\r\n  Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?\"\r\n\r\nA few months later, at the behest of our Government, the French\r\narms were withdrawn, the bubble of Mexican Empire vanished, and\r\nthe ill-fated Maximilian had bravely met his tragic end.  Thenceforth,\r\na resident but no longer a citizen of the land that had given\r\nhim birth, William M. Gwin, to the end of his life, bore the\r\nhigh sounding but empty title of \"Duke of Sonora.\"\r\n\r\nFrequent as have been the instances in our own country where death\r\nhas resulted from duelling, it is believed that in but one has the\r\nsurvivor incurred the extreme penalty of the law.  That one case\r\noccurred in 1820 in Illinois.  What was intended merely as a \"mock\r\nduel\" by their respective friends, was fought with rifles by William\r\nBennett and Alphonso Stewart in Belleville.  It was privately agreed\r\nby the seconds of each that the rifles should be loaded with blank\r\ncartridges.  This arrangement was faithfully carried out so far as\r\nthe seconds were concerned; but Bennett, the challenging party,\r\nmanaged to get a bullet into his own gun.  The result was the\r\nimmediate death of Stewart, and the flight of his antagonist.  Upon\r\nhis return to Belleville a year or two later, Bennett was immediately\r\narrested, placed upon trial, convicted, and executed.\r\n\r\nIn more than one instance, at a later day, while well-known\r\nIllinoisans have been parties to actual or prospective duels, no\r\ninstance has occurred of a hostile meeting of that character within\r\nthe limits of the State.  A late auditor of public account, but\r\nrecently deceased, killed his antagonist in a duel with rifles\r\nnearly half a century ago in California.\r\n\r\nWilliam I. Ferguson, one of the most brilliant orators Illinois\r\nhas known, in early professional life the associate of men who have\r\nsince achieved national distinction, fell in a duel while a member\r\nof the State Senate in California.\r\n\r\nDuring the sitting of the Illinois Constitutional Convention of\r\n1847, two of its prominent members, Campbell and Pratt, delegates from\r\nthe northern tier of counties, became involved in a bitter personal\r\ncontroversy which resulted in a challenge by Pratt to mortal combat.\r\nThe challenge was accepted and the principals with their seconds repaired\r\nto the famous \"Bloody Island\" in the Mississippi, when by the\r\ninterposition of friends a peaceable settlement was effected.  The sequel\r\nto this happily averted duel was the incorporation in the Constitution,\r\nthen in process of formulation, of a provision prohibiting duelling in\r\nthe State, and attaching severe penalties to sending or accepting\r\na challenge.\r\n\r\nThe earliest hostile meeting of Illinoisans was upon the island\r\nlast mentioned before State organization had been effected.  The\r\nprincipals were young men of well-known courage and ability--one\r\nof whom, Shadrack Bond, upon the admission of Illinois was elected\r\nits Governor.  His adversary, John Rice Jones, was the first lawyer\r\nto locate in the Illinois country, and was the brother of the second\r\nof the unfortunate Cilley in the tragic encounter already related.\r\nThe late Governor Bissell of Illinois was once challenged by\r\nJefferson Davis.  Both were at the time members of Congress, and\r\nthe _casus belli_ was language reflecting upon the conduct of some\r\nof the participants in the then recently fought battle of Buena\r\nVista.  After the acceptance of the challenge, mutual friends of\r\nDavis and Bissell effected a reconciliation, just before the hour set\r\nfor the hostile meeting.\r\n\r\nSo far as Illinois combatants are concerned, the historic island\r\nmentioned above has little claim to its bloody designation, inasmuch\r\nas the \"affairs\" mentioned, and one much more famous, yet to be\r\nnoted, were all honorably adjusted without physical harm to any of\r\nthe participants.\r\n\r\nThe \"affair of honor,\" the mention of which will close this chapter,\r\nowes its chief importance to the prominence attained at a later\r\nday by its principals.  The challenger, James Shields, was at that\r\ntime, 1842, a State officer of Illinois, and later a general in\r\ntwo wars and a Senator from three States.  The name of his adversary\r\nhas since \"been given to the ages.\"  Mr. Lincoln was, at the time he\r\naccepted Mr. Shields's challenge, a young lawyer, unmarried, residing\r\nat the State capital.  He was the recognized leader of the Whig\r\nparty, and an active participant in the fierce political conflicts\r\nof the day.  Some criticism in which he had indulged, touching the\r\nadministration of the office of which Shields was the incumbent,\r\nwas the immediate cause of the challenge.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Lincoln was upon principle opposed to duelling would be\r\nreadily inferred from his characteristic kindness.  That \"we are\r\ntime's subjects,\" however, and that the public opinion of sixty-odd\r\nyears ago is not that of to-day will readily appear from the\r\npublished statement of his friend Dr. Merryman:\r\n\r\n\"I told Mr. Lincoln what was brewing, and asked him what course he\r\nproposed to himself.  He said that he was wholly opposed to duelling\r\nand would do anything to avoid it that might not degrade him in\r\nthe estimation of himself and friends; but if such a degradation, or\r\na fight, were the only alternatives, he would fight.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated by one of the biographers of Mr. Lincoln that he\r\nwas ever after averse to any allusion to the Shields affair.  From\r\nthe terms of his acceptance, it is evident that he intended neither\r\nto injure his adversary seriously nor to receive injury at his\r\nhands.  In his lengthy letter of instruction to his second, he\r\nclosed by saying:\r\n\r\n\"If nothing like this is done, the preliminaries of the fight are to\r\nbe, first, weapons:  cavalry broadswords of the largest size,\r\nprecisely equal in all respects.  Second, position:  a plank ten\r\nfeet long and from nine to twelve inches broad, to be firmly fixed\r\non edge on the ground as the line between us which neither is to\r\npass his foot over upon forfeit of his life.  Next, a line drawn\r\non the ground on either side of said plank and parallel with it,\r\neach at the distance of the whole length of the sword, and three\r\nfeet additional from the plank; the passing of his own line by\r\neither party during the fight shall be deemed a surrender of the\r\ncontest.  Third, time:  on Thursday evening at five o'clock within\r\nthree miles of Alton on the opposite side of the river, the particular\r\nspot to be agreed on by you.  Any preliminary details coming within\r\nthe above rules you are at liberty to make at your discretion, but\r\nyou are in no case to swerve from these rules or to pass beyond\r\ntheir limits.\"\r\n\r\nThe keen sense of the humorous, with which Mr. Lincoln was so\r\nabundantly gifted, seems not to have wholly deserted him even in\r\nthe serious moments when penning an acceptance to mortal combat.\r\nThe terms of meeting indicated--which he as the challenged party\r\nhad the right to dictate--lend color to the opinion that he regarded\r\nthe affair in the light of a mere farce.  His superior height\r\nand length of arm remembered, and the position of the less favored\r\nShields, with broadsword in hand, at the opposite side of the board,\r\nand not permitted \"upon forfeit of his life\" to advance an inch\r\n--the picture is indeed a ludicrous one.\r\n\r\nOut of the lengthy statements of the respective seconds--the\r\npublication of which came near involving themselves in personal\r\naltercation--it appears that all parties actually reached the\r\nappointed rendezvous on time.\r\n\r\nBut it was not written in the book of fate that this duel was to\r\ntake place.  Something of mightier moment was awaiting one of\r\nthe actors in this drama.  Two level-headed men, R. W. English and\r\nJohn J. Hardin, the friends respectively of Shields and Lincoln,\r\ncrossing the Mississippi in a canoe close in the wake of the\r\nbelligerents, reached the field just before the appointed hour.\r\nThese gentlemen, acting in concert with the seconds, Whiteside and\r\nMerryman, soon effected a reconciliation deemed honorable to all, and\r\nthe Shields-Lincoln duel passed to the domain of history.  That\r\nthe reconciliation thus brought about was sincere was evidenced by\r\nthe fact that one of the earliest acts of President Lincoln was\r\nthe appointment of General Shields to an important military command.\r\n\r\nHow strangely \"the whirligig of time brings in his revenges!\"  A\r\nfew paces apart in the old Hall at the Capitol at Washington, stand\r\ntwo statues, the contribution of Illinois for enduring place in\r\nthe \"Temple of the Immortals.\"  One is the statue of Lincoln,\r\nthe other that of Shields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\nA PRINCELY GIFT\r\n\r\nDESCENT OF JAMES SMITHSON, FOUNDER OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION--\r\nHIS EDUCATION AND HIS WRITINGS--HIS WILL--THE UNITED STATES HIS\r\nRESIDUARY LEGATEE--SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF THE CLAIM OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES TO THE LEGACY--PLANS SUGGESTED FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE FUND\r\n--PROF. JOSEPH HENRY APPOINTED SECRETARY--BENEFICENT WORK OF THE\r\nINSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nAlthough a third of a century has passed since I met Professor\r\nJoseph Henry, I distinctly recall his kindly greeting and the\r\ncourteous manner in which he gave me the information I requested\r\nfor the use of one of the Committees of the House.\r\n\r\nThe frosts of many winters were then on his brow, and he was near the\r\nclose of an honorable career, one of measureless benefit to mankind.\r\nHe was the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and the\r\noriginator of the plan by which was carried into practical effect the\r\nsplendid bequest for \"the increase and diffusion of knowledge among\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nAs Vice-President of the United States, a regent _ex-officio_ of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, I had rare opportunity to learn much of\r\nits history and something of its marvellous accomplishment.  As is\r\nwell known, it bears the name of James Smithson.  He was an\r\nEnglishman, related to the historic family of Percy, and a\r\nlineal descendent of Henry the Seventh, his maternal ancestor being\r\nthe ill-fated Lady Jane Grey, cousin to Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nMr. Langley, the late secretary of the institution, said:\r\n\r\n\"Smithson always seems to have regarded the circumstances of his\r\nbirth as doing him a peculiar injustice, and it was apparently this\r\nsense that he had been deprived of honors properly his which made him\r\nlook for other sources of fame than those which birth had denied\r\nhim, and constituted the motive of the most important action of\r\nhis life, the creation of the Smithsonian Institution.\"\r\n\r\nThe deep resentment of Smithson against the great families who had\r\nvirtually disowned him, finds vent in a letter yet extant, of which\r\nthe following is a part:  \"The best blood of England flows in my\r\nveins; on my father's side I am a Northumberland, on my mother's\r\nI am related to kings; but this avails me not.  My name shall live\r\nin the memory of man when the titles of the Northumberlands and\r\nthe Percys are extinct and forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nHow truly his indignant forecast was prophetic is now a matter\r\nof history.  Few men know much about the once proud families of\r\nNorthumberland or Percy, but the name of the youth they scornfully\r\ndisowned lives in the institution he founded, the greatest\r\ninstrumentality yet devised for \"the increase and diffusion of\r\nknowledge among men.\"\r\n\r\nSmithson was born in 1765, and received the degree of Master of\r\nArts from Pembroke College at the age of twenty-one.  A year later\r\nhe was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society, upon the recommendation\r\nof his instructors, as being \"a gentleman well versed in the various\r\nbranches of Natural Philosophy, and particularly in Chemistry and\r\nMineralogy.\"  As a student, he was devoted to the study of the\r\nsciences, especially chemistry, and his entire life, in fact,\r\nwas given to scientific research.  Twenty-seven papers from his\r\npen were published in \"The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety\" and in \"Thompson's Annals of Philosophy,\" near the close of\r\nthe eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, and\r\n\"all give evidence that he was an assiduous and faithful\r\nexperimenter.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection, the statement of Professor Clarke, Chief Chemist\r\nof the United States Geographical Survey, is in point:\r\n\r\n\"The most notable feature of Smithson's writings from the standpoint\r\nof the analytical chemist, is the success obtained with the most\r\nprimitive and unsatisfactory appliances.  In Smithson's day, chemical\r\napparatus was undeveloped, and instruments were improvised from\r\nsuch materials as lay readiest to hand.  With such instruments,\r\nand with crude reagents, Smithson obtained analytical results of\r\nthe most creditable character, and enlarged our knowledge of\r\nmany mineral species.  In his time, the native carbonate and the\r\nsilicate of zinc were confounded as one species under the name\r\ncalamine; but his researches distinguished between the two minerals,\r\nwhich are now known as Smithsonite and Calamine, respectively.\r\n\r\n\"To theory Smithson contributed little, if anything; but from a\r\ntheoretical point of view, the tone of his writings is singularly\r\nmodern.  His work was mostly done before Dalton had announced\r\nthe atomic theory; and yet Smithson saw clearly that a law of\r\ndefinite proportions must exist, although he did not attempt to\r\naccount for it.  His ability as a reasoner is best shown in his\r\npaper on the Kirkdale Bone Cave, which Penn had sought to interpret\r\nby reference to the Noachian Deluge.  A clearer and more\r\ncomplete demolition of Penn's views could hardly be written to-day.\r\nSmithson was gentle with his adversary, but none the less thorough,\r\nfor all his moderation.  He is not to be classed among the leaders\r\nof scientific thought; but his ability and the usefulness of his\r\ncontributions to knowledge, cannot be doubted.\"\r\n\r\nThe life of Smithson was uncheered by domestic affection; he was\r\nof singularly retiring disposition, had no intimacies, spent the\r\nclosing years of his life in Paris, and was long the uncomplaining\r\nvictim of a painful malady.  Professor Langley said of him:\r\n\r\n\"One gathers from his letters, from the uniform consideration with\r\nwhich he speaks of others, from kind traits which he showed, and\r\nfrom the general tenor of what is not here particularly cited, the\r\nremembrance of an innately gentle nature, but also of a man who is\r\ngradually renouncing not without bitterness the youthful hope of\r\nfame, and as health and hope diminished together, is finally living\r\nfor the day, rather than for any future.\"\r\n\r\nHe died in Genoa, Italy, June 27, 1829, and was buried in the little\r\nEnglish cemetery on the heights of San Benigno.  The Institution\r\nhe founded has placed a tablet over his tomb and surrounded it with\r\nevidences of continued and thoughtful care.\r\n\r\nHis will--possibly of deeper concern to mankind than any yet written\r\n--bears date October 23, 1826.  In its opening clause he designates\r\nhimself:  \"Son of Hugh, First Duke of Northumberland, and Elizabeth,\r\nheiress of the Hungerfords of Studley, and niece to Charles the\r\nproud Duke of Somerset.\"  Herein clearly appears his undying\r\nresentment toward those who had denied him the position in life to\r\nwhich he considered himself justly entitled.\r\n\r\nThe only persons designated in his will as legatees are a faithful\r\nservant, for whom abundant provision was made, and Henry James\r\nHungerford, nephew of the testator.  To the latter was devised the\r\nentire estate except the legacy to the servant mentioned.  The\r\nclause of the will which has given the name of Smithson to the ages\r\nseems to have been almost casually inserted; it appears between\r\nthe provision for his servant and the one for an investment of the\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nThe clause in his will which was to cause his name \"to live in the\r\nmemory of man when the titles of the Northumberlands and the Percys\r\nare extinct and forgotten,\" was,--\r\n\r\n\"In the case of the death of my said nephew without leaving a child\r\nor children, or the death of the child or children he may have had\r\nunder the age of twenty-one years, or intestate, I then bequeath\r\nthe whole of my property subject to the annuity of one hundred\r\npounds to John Fitall (for the security and payment of which I have\r\nmade provision) to the United States of America, to found at\r\nWashington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an\r\nestablishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nWhy he selected the United States as his residuary legatee has long\r\nbeen, and will continue to be, the subject of curious inquiry.  He\r\nhad never been in America, had no correspondent here, and nowhere in\r\nhis writings has there been found an allusion to our country.\r\nSo far as we know, he could have had no possible prejudice in favor\r\nof our system of representative government.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, however, in this connection, that the pivotal\r\nclause in his will bears striking resemblance to the admonition,\r\n\"Promote as an object of primary importance institutions for the\r\ngeneral diffusion of knowledge,\" contained in the farewell address\r\nof President Washington.\r\n\r\nThe contingency provided for happened; the death of the nephew\r\nHungerford unmarried and without heirs occurred six years after\r\nthat of the testator.  The first announcement to the people of the\r\nUnited States of the facts stated was contained in a special message\r\nfrom President Jackson to Congress, December 17, 1835.  Accompanying\r\nthe message was a letter with a detailed statement, and copy of\r\nthe will, from our Legation in London.  In closing his brief message\r\nof transmission, President Jackson says:  \"The Executive having no\r\nauthority to take any steps for accepting the trust and obtaining the\r\nfunds, the papers are communicated with a view to such measures as\r\nCongress may deem necessary.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first day of July, 1836, a bill authorizing the President\r\nto assert and prosecute the claim of the United States to the\r\nSmithson legacy became a law.  This, however, was after much\r\nopposition in Congress; a member of the House indignantly declaring\r\nthat our Government should receive nothing by way of gift from\r\nEngland, and proposing that the bequest should be denied.  The\r\nprophetic words of the venerable John Quincy Adams--then a member of\r\nthe House after his retirement from the Presidency--in advocating\r\nthe passage of the bill are worthy of remembrance:\r\n\r\n\"Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses\r\nwhich ever signalized the spirit of the age, or the comprehensive\r\nbeneficence of the founders, none can be named more deserving the\r\napprobation of mankind than this.  Should it be faithfully carried\r\ninto effect with an earnestness and sagacity of application and a\r\nsteady perseverance of purpose proportioned to the means furnished\r\nby the will of the founder, and to the greatness and simplicity of\r\nhis design as by himself declared,--'the increase and diffusion of\r\nknowledge among men,'--it is no extravagance of anticipation to declare\r\nthat his name will hereafter be enrolled among the benefactors of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nIn the execution of this law, the President immediately upon its\r\nenactment appointed Richard Rush, a distinguished lawyer of\r\nPhiladelphia, to proceed to London, and take the necessary steps\r\nto obtain the legacy.  To the accomplishment of this purpose a suit\r\nwas soon thereafter instituted by Mr. Rush.  The hopelessness of\r\nits early termination in an English Chancery Court of that day will\r\nat once occur to the readers of Dickens's famous \"Jarndyce against\r\nJarndyce.\"  It was truly said, that a chancery suit was a thing\r\nwhich might begin with a man's life, and its termination be his\r\nepitaph.\r\n\r\nA wiser selection than Mr. Rush could not have been made.  He\r\nentered upon the work to which he had been appointed, with great\r\ndetermination.  In a letter to our Secretary of State just after\r\nhe had instituted suit, he says:\r\n\r\n\"A suit of higher interest and dignity, has rarely perhaps been\r\nbefore the tribunals of a nation.  If the trust created by the\r\ntestator's will be successfully carried into effect by the enlightened\r\nlegislation of Congress, benefits may flow to the United States,\r\nand to the human family, not easy to be estimated, because operating\r\nsilently and gradually throughout time, yet not operating the less\r\neffectually.  Not to speak of the inappreciable value of letters\r\nto individual and social man, the monuments which they raise to\r\na nation's glory often last when others perish, and seem especially\r\nappropriate to the glory of a Republic whose foundations are laid in\r\nthe assumed intelligence of its citizens, and can only be strengthened\r\nand perpetuated as that improve.\"\r\n\r\nThe successful termination of the suit came, however, sooner\r\nthan could have been expected; and in May, 1838, the amount of the\r\nlegacy, exceeding the substantial sum of five hundred thousand\r\ndollars, was received and invested as required by law.\r\n\r\nThe facts stated were communicated by special message from President\r\nVan Buren to Congress, in December, 1838.  Attention was then called\r\nto the fact that he had applied to persons versed in science,\r\nfor their views as to the mode of disposing of the fund which would\r\nbe calculated best to meet the intent of the testator, and prove\r\nmost beneficial to mankind.\r\n\r\nDuring the eight years intervening between this message and the\r\npassage of the bill for the incorporation of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, much discussion was had in and out of Congress, as to\r\nthe best method of making effective the intention of the testator.\r\n\r\nIn the light of events, some of the many plans suggested are even now\r\nof curious interest.  The establishment of a magnificent national library\r\nat the Capital; the founding of a great university; of a normal\r\nschool; a post graduate school; and astronomical observatory \"equal\r\nto any in the world,\" are a few of the plans from time to time\r\nproposed and earnestly advocated.\r\n\r\nThe act of incorporation in 1846, the appointment of a Board of\r\nRegents, and the selection of a Secretary, mark the beginning of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution.  In the selection of a Secretary, the\r\nchief officer of the institution, the regents builded better\r\nthan they knew.  The choice fell upon Professor Joseph Henry of\r\nPrinceton, then peerless among men of science in America.  The\r\nappointment was accepted, and the essential features of the plan\r\nof organization he proposed were adopted in December, 1847.\r\nThis plan recognized as\r\n\r\n\"Fundamental that the terms 'increase' and 'diffusion' should\r\nreceive literal interpretation in accordance with the evident\r\nintention of the testator; that such terms being logically distinct,\r\nthe two purposes mentioned in the bequest were to be kept in view in\r\nthe organization of the institution; that the increase of knowledge\r\nshould be effected by the encouragement of original researches\r\nof the highest character; and its diffusion by the publication\r\nof the results of original research, by means of the publication\r\nof a series of volumes of original memoirs; that the object of the\r\ninstitution should not be restricted in favor of any particular\r\nkind of knowledge; if to any, only to the higher and more abstract,\r\nto the discovery of new principles rather than that of isolated\r\nfacts; that the institution should in no sense be national; that\r\nthe bequest was intended for the benefit of mankind in general,\r\nand not for any single nation.\r\n\r\n\"The accumulation and care of collections of objects of nature and\r\nart, the development of a library, the providing of courses of\r\nlectures, and the organization of a system of meteorological\r\nobservation, were to be only incidental to the fundamental design of\r\nincreasing and diffusing knowledge among men.\"\r\n\r\nIn its inception, and in its widening influence during the passing\r\nyears, those entrusted with the actual management of this institution\r\nhave conscientiously kept in view the clearly expressed intention of\r\nits founder.  Following the distinctive but parallel paths, \"increase\"\r\nand \"diffusion,\" the Smithsonian Institution, yet in its infancy, has\r\nadded largely to the sum of useful knowledge.  Its accredited\r\nrepresentatives are out upon every pathway of intelligent research\r\nand discovery.  Under the wise operation of this marvellous\r\ninstrumentality, long-concealed secrets of nature have been\r\ndiscovered, and it can hardly be doubted that all that is given to\r\nman to know will yet be revealed, and it will be permitted him\r\n\r\n  \"To read what is still unread,\r\n  In the manuscripts of God.\"\r\n\r\nBy indefatigable investigation, and by world-wide publication of\r\nthe results, mankind has indeed become, as was intended, the\r\nbeneficiary of the princely bequest.\r\n\r\nMore fitting words could not be selected with which to close\r\nthis sketch than those of the gifted and lamented Langley, whose\r\nbest years were given to scientific research, and whose name is\r\ninseparably associated with the Smithsonian Institution:\r\n\r\n\"What has been done in these two paths the reader may partly gather\r\nfrom this volume--in the former from the various articles by\r\ncontemporary men of science, describing its activities in research\r\nand original contributions to the increase of human knowledge;\r\nin the latter, in numerous way--among others from the description of\r\nthe work of one of its bureaux, that of the International Exchanges,\r\nwhere it may be more immediately seen how universal is the scope\r\nof the action of the Institution, which, in accordance with its\r\nmotto 'PER ORBEM,' is not limited to the country of its adoption, but\r\nbelongs to the world, there being outside of the United States more\r\nthan twelve thousand correspondents scattered through every portion\r\nof the globe; indeed there is hardly a language, or a people, where\r\nthe results of Smithson's benefaction are not known, and associated\r\nwith his name.\r\n\r\n\"If we were permitted to think of him as conscious of what has\r\nbeen, is being, and is still to be done, in pursuance of his wish,\r\nwe might believe that he would feel that his hope at a time when\r\nlife must have seemed so hopeless, was finding full fruition;\r\nfor events are justifying what may have seemed, at the time, but\r\na rhetorical expression, in the language of a former President of\r\nthe United States, who has said:  'Renowned as is the name of Percy\r\nin the historical annals of England, let the trust of James Smithson\r\nto the United States of America be faithfully executed, let the\r\nresult accomplish his object, the increase and diffusion of knowledge\r\namong men, and a wreath more unfading shall entwine itself in\r\nthe lapse of future ages around the name of Smithson than the united\r\nhands of history and poetry have braided around the name of\r\nPercy through the long ages past.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\nTHE OLD RANGER\r\n\r\nJOHN REYNOLDS, GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS, A BORN POLITICIAN--HIS KNOWLEDGE\r\nOF THE PEOPLE--HIS AFFECTATION OF HUMILITY--ADMITTED TO THE BAR\r\n--HE CONDEMNS A MURDERER TO DEATH--HIS CURIOUS ADDRESS TO ANOTHER\r\nMURDERER--BECOMES A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE--ELECTED GOVERNOR\r\n--HIS GENEROSITY TO HIS POLITICAL ENEMIES--BECOMES A MEMBER OF\r\nCONGRESS--HIS ADMIRATION FOR HIS ASSOCIATES--ELECTED A MEMBER OF THE\r\nGENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE--RETIRES TO PRIVATE LIFE.\r\n\r\nThis world of ours will be much older before the like of John\r\nReynolds, the fourth Governor of Illinois, again appears upon\r\nits stage.  The title which he generously gave himself in early\r\nmanhood, upon his return after a brief experience as a trooper\r\nin pursuit of a marauding band of Winnebagoes, stood him well in\r\nhand in all his future contests for office.  \"The Old Ranger\" was a\r\n_sobriquet_ to conjure with, and turned the scales in his favor in\r\nmany a doubtful contest.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was a born politician if ever one\r\ntrod this green earth.  He was a perennial candidate for office,\r\nand it was said he never took a drink of water without serious\r\nmeditation as to how it might possibly affect his political prospects.\r\nThe late Uriah Heep might easily have gotten a few points in\r\n\"'umbleness,\" if he had accompanied the Old Ranger in one or two\r\nof his political campaigns.\r\n\r\nWhile Illinois was yet a Territory, his father had emigrated from the\r\nmountains of Tennessee and located near the historic village of\r\nKaskaskia.  This was at the time the capital of the Territory.\r\nThe village mentioned was then the most, and in fact, the only,\r\nimportant place in the vast area constituting the present State of\r\nIllinois.  There were less than five thousand persons of all\r\nnationalities and conditions in the Territory, and they mainly\r\nin and about Kaskaskia, and southward to the Ohio.  Beck's Gazetteer\r\npublished in 1823--five years after the admission of the State into\r\nthe Union--contains the following:  \"Chicago, a village of Pike\r\nCounty, situated on Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Chicago Creek.\r\nIt contains twelve or fifteen houses, and about sixty or seventy\r\ninhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance of John Reynolds with what was then known as \"the\r\nIllinois Country\" began in 1800, and his thorough knowledge of the\r\npeople and their ways gave him rare opportunities for acquiring\r\ngreat personal popularity.  Fairly well educated for the times,\r\ngifted with an abundance of shrewdness, and withal an excellent\r\njudge of human nature, he soon became a man of mark in the new\r\ncountry.  He was at all times and under all circumstances the\r\nself-constituted \"friend of the people.\"  He affected to be one of\r\nthe humblest of the sons of men; and his dress, language, and\r\ndeportment were always in strict keeping with that assumption.  For\r\nthe pride of ancestry he had a supreme contempt.  In his \"My Own\r\nTimes,\" published a few years before his death, he said:  \"I regard\r\nthe whole subject of ancestry and descent as utterly frivolous and\r\nunworthy of a moment's serious attention.\"\r\n\r\nThis recalls what Judge Baldwin said of Cave Burton:\r\n\r\n\"He was not clearly satisfied that Esau made as foolish a bargain with\r\nhis brother Jacob as some think.  If the birth-right was _a mere\r\nmatter of family pride,_ and the pottage of agreeable taste, Cave was\r\nnot quite sure that Esau had not gotten the advantage in his famed\r\nbargain with the Father of Israel.\"\r\n\r\nHumility was Reynolds's highest card, and when out among the people\r\nhe was always figuratively clothed in sackcloth and ashes.  A\r\nfew extracts from his book may be of interest:\r\n\r\n\"I was a singular spectacle when in 1809 I started to Tennessee to\r\ncollege.  I looked like a trapper going to the Rocky Mountains.\r\nI wore a cream-colored hat made of the fur of the prairie wolf,\r\nwhich gave me a grotesque appearance.  I was well acquainted with the\r\nmysteries of horse and foot races, shooting matches, and other wild\r\nsports of the backwoods, but had not studied the polish of the\r\nball-room and was sorely beset with diffidence, awkwardness, and\r\npoverty.\"\r\n\r\nLater, and when out in pursuit of the Indians, he said:  \"But\r\ndiffidence never permitted me to approach an officer's tent, or\r\nsolicit any one for office.\"\r\n\r\nNone the less, the office of Orderly Sergeant being thrust upon\r\nhim, he managed in his humble way to get through with it\r\npassably well.\r\n\r\nWhen the State Government was organized in 1818, while shrinking\r\nfrom even the gaze of men, and spurning from the depths of his soul\r\nthe arts of politicians, he managed in some way to be designated\r\none of the judges of the Supreme Court of the new State.  His\r\nadmiration for the dispensing hand appears as follows:  \"Wisdom\r\nand integrity, with other noble qualities, gave Governor Bond a\r\nhigh standing with his contemporaries.  Wisdom and integrity shed a\r\nbeacon light around his path through life, showing him to be one\r\nof the noblest works of God.\"\r\n\r\nFour years prior to this appointment, he had been admitted to\r\nthe bar, after \"undergoing with much diffidence\" his examination.\r\nThis accomplished, he adds:  \"In the Winter of 1814, I established\r\na very humble and obscure law-office in the French village of\r\nCahokia, the county seat of St. Clair County.\"  The bearing of the\r\none whose meat was locusts and wild honey, and whose loins were\r\ngirt about with a leathern girdle, was arrogance itself, when\r\ncompared with the deportment of the later John in the wilderness\r\nat the period whereof we write.\r\n\r\nThat he was orthodox upon what pertained to medical practice will now\r\nappear:  \"It was the universal practice to give the patient of the\r\nbilious disease, first, tartar emetic; next day, calomel and jalap;\r\nand the third day, Peruvian bark.  This was generally sufficient.\"\r\nThe latter statement will hardly be questioned.\r\n\r\nHow his first visitation of the tender passion was mingled with\r\na relish of philosophy is recorded for the benefit of posterity:\r\n\r\n\"During all my previous life until within a short time before I\r\nmarried, I had not the least intention of that state of existence,\r\nand I expressed myself often to my friends to the same effect; but\r\non the subject of matrimony, a passion influences the parties which\r\ngenerally succeeds.  Judgment and prudence should be mixed in\r\nequal parts with love and affection in the transaction, to secure a\r\nlasting and happy union.\"\r\n\r\nWith all his diffidence, however, the Old Ranger happened to turn up\r\nat the seat of Government in time \"to be persuaded by my friends\r\nto be a candidate for a Judgeship.  It broke in on me like a clap of\r\nthunder.\"  The mite of philosophy with which he excused himself\r\nfor giving way to the urgent demand of his friends is as follows:\r\n\"Human nature is easier to persuade to mount upwards than to remain\r\non the common level.\"\r\n\r\nHis mind, as will appear, was essentially of the strictly practical\r\ncast.  He no doubt believed with Macaulay that \"one acre in Middlesex\r\nis worth a principality in Utopia.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Republican simplicity of the new Judge followed him from his\r\n\"very humble and obscure law-office\" to the Bench, will now appear:\r\n\r\n\"The very first court I held was in Washington County, and it was to\r\nme a strange and novel business.  I was amongst old comrades\r\nwith whom I had been raised, ranged in the war with them, and lived\r\nwith them in great intimacy and equality, so that it was difficult\r\nto assume a different relationship than I had previously occupied with\r\nthem.  Moreover I detested a mock dignity.  Both the sheriff and\r\nclerk were rangers in the same company with myself, and it seemed we\r\nwere still ranging on equal terms in pursuit of the Indians.\r\nThe sheriff was of the same opinion and very familiar.  He opened court\r\nsitting astride on a bench in the Court-house, and without rising,\r\nproclaimed:  'The court is now open, and our John is on the bench.'\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that the first case of importance that\r\ncame before Judge Reynolds, was the trial of one William Bennett\r\nfor murder.  He had killed his antagonist in a duel in St. Clair\r\nCounty, for which he suffered the death penalty.  This is the only\r\nduel ever fought in Illinois.  No doubt the prompt execution of\r\nBennett did much to discourage duelling in the State.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the charge that he had acted with unbecoming levity\r\nupon the trial of Bennett, the Judge said, \"No human being of my\r\nhumble capacity could have acted with more painful feelings and\r\nsympathy than did I on this occasion.\"  Having thus vindicated\r\nhimself from the serious charge mentioned, he adds:\r\n\r\n\"I am opposed to capital punishment in any case where the convict can\r\nbe kept in solitary confinement without pardoning his life; it was\r\nextremely painful and awful to me to be the instrument in the hands\r\nof the law to pronounce sentence of death upon my fellow-man,\r\nextinguishing him forever from the face of the earth, and depriving\r\nhim of life, which I think belongs to God and not to man.\"\r\n\r\nHe consoles himself, however, as he closes his narrative of this\r\nsad affair, that \"it never did assume the character of a regular\r\nand honorable duel.\"  It is very satisfactory also, even at this\r\ndistant date, to be assured by the Judge that \"the prisoner embraced\r\nreligion, was baptized, and died happy, before spectators to the\r\nnumber of two thousand or more.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Ford, in his history of Illinois, relates the following\r\nincident as characteristic of Judge Reynolds.  The latter was\r\nholding court in Washington County when one Green was found guilty\r\nupon an indictment for murder.  The court was near the hour of\r\nadjournment for the term, when the prosecuting attorney suggested to\r\nthe court that the prisoner Green be brought in in order that\r\nsentence be passed upon him.  \"Certainly, certainly,\" said the\r\nJudge, and the prisoner was at once brought in from the jail\r\nnear by.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Green,\" said the Judge in a familiar tone, \"the jury in\r\nyour case have found you guilty.  I want you to understand, Mr.\r\nGreen, and all your friends down on Indian Creek to know, that\r\nit is not I who condemns you, but the jury and the law.  The law\r\nallows you time for preparation, Mr. Green; and so the court wants\r\nto know what time it would suit you to be hung?\"  The prisoner\r\nreplying that he was ready to suffer at whatever time the court\r\nmight appoint, the Judge said;\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Green, you must know that it is a very serious matter to be\r\nhung.  It can't happen to a man more than once in his life, and\r\nyou had better take all the time you can get; the court will give you\r\ntill this day four weeks.  Mr. Clerk, look at the almanac and see if\r\nthis day four weeks comes on Sunday.\"  The Clerk after examination\r\nreported that that day four weeks came on Friday.  The Judge then\r\nsaid:  \"Mr. Green, the court gives you till this day four weeks,\r\nand then you are to be hanged.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the prosecuting officer, the Hon. James Turney, an able and\r\ndignified lawyer, said:\r\n\r\n\"May it please the court, on solemn occasion like the present, when\r\nthe life of a human being is to be sentenced away for crime by\r\nan earthly tribunal, it is usual and proper for courts to pronounce\r\na formal sentence, in which the leading features of the crime shall\r\nbe brought to the recollection of the prisoner, a sense of his\r\nguilt impressed upon his conscience, and in which the prisoner\r\nshould be duly exhorted to repentance and warned against the judgment\r\nin a world to come.\"\r\n\r\nTo which the Judge replied:  \"Oh, Mr. Turney, Mr. Green understands\r\nthe whole matter as well as if I had preached to him a month.\r\nHe knows he has got to be hung this day four weeks.  You understand\r\nit that way, Mr. Green, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the prisoner, upon which the Judge again expressing\r\nthe hope that he and all his friends down on Indian Creek would\r\nunderstand that it was the act of the jury and of the law, _and\r\nnot of the Judge,_ ordered the prisoner to be remanded to jail,\r\nand the court adjourned for the term.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, by no means satisfactorily explained, Judge Reynolds\r\nretired from the bench at the end of his four years' term.  In\r\n\"Breese,\" the first volume of Illinois reports, is an opinion by\r\nJudge Reynolds which has been the subject of amusing comment by\r\nthree generations of lawyers.  After giving sundry reasons why\r\nthere was error in the judgment below, the learned Judge concludes:\r\n\"Therefore, the judgment _ought to be_ reversed; but inasmuch as\r\nthe court is equally divided in opinion, it is therefore\r\n_affirmed.\"_\r\n\r\nHe then resumed the practice of the law, and as he says, \"was\r\nfamiliar with the people, got acquainted with everybody, and became\r\nsomewhat popular.  I had no settled object in view other than to\r\nmake a living, and to continue on my humble, peaceable, and agreeable\r\nmanner.\"  In view of the aversion already shown to office-holding,\r\nthe following disclaimer upon the part of the Judge seems wholly\r\nsuperfluous:  \"I had no political ambition or aspirations for office\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that at this time his domestic affairs\r\nwere in a satisfactory condition:  \"Plain and unpretending; never kept\r\nany liquor in the house--treated my friends to every civility except\r\nliquor; used an economy bordering on parsimony.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the favorable conditions mentioned, the Judge was enabled to\r\novercome his aversion to holding office, and became a humble member\r\nof the State Legislature immediately upon his retirement from\r\nthe bench.  That his \"modest aspirations\" were on a higher plane\r\nthan that of ordinary legislators will clearly appear from the\r\nfollowing:  \"I entered this Legislature without any ulterior views,\r\nand with an eye single to advance the best interests of the State,\r\nand particularly the welfare of old St. Clair County.  My only\r\nambition was to acquit myself properly, and to advance the best\r\ninterests of the country.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, the aversion of the Old Ranger for office was\r\nagain overcome, as will appear from the following:  \"I entered this\r\nLegislature, as I had the last, without any pledge or restraints\r\nwhatever; I then was, and am yet, only an humble member of the\r\nDemocratic party.\"\r\n\r\nHis friends were again on the war-path and the shadow of the chief\r\nexecutive office of the State was now beginning to fall across his\r\npathway.  He says:\r\n\r\n\"It would require volumes to record the transactions of these\r\nLegislatures, and of my humble labors in them; but it was my course\r\nof conduct in these two sessions of the General Assembly that\r\ninduced my friends, _without any solicitation on my part,_ to offer\r\nme as a candidate for Governor.  I was urged not by politicians,\r\nbut by reasonable and reflecting men, more to advance the interest\r\nof the State than my own.\"\r\n\r\nIf we did not, from his own lips, know how the Judge loathed\r\n\"the arts of politicians,\" we might almost be tempted to conclude from\r\nthe following that he was one of them:\r\n\r\n\"I traversed every section of the State, and knew well the people.\r\nMy friends had the utmost confidence in my knowledge of the people,\r\nand when I suggested any policy to be observed, this suggestion\r\nwas consequently carried out as I requested--thus placing all under\r\none leader.\"\r\n\r\nThis, it will be remembered, was in 1830, and neither Reynolds nor\r\nKinney, his competitor, had received a party nomination.  Both were\r\nof the same party, Kinney being a strong Jackson man of the\r\nultra type, and the Judge only a \"plain, humble, reflecting Jackson\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time during the campaign it seemed as if there were real\r\ndanger of this candidate of the \"reflecting men of the State\"\r\nactually falling into the ways and wiles of politicians.  \"I often\r\naddressed the people in churches, in courthouses, and in the\r\nopen air, myself occupying literally the stump of a large tree;\r\n_at times also in a grocery.\"_\r\n\r\nThe fiery and abusive hand-bills against his competitor he did not\r\nattempt to restrain his friends from circulating, \"as they had a\r\nright to exercise their own judgment\"; but he declares he did\r\nnot circulate one himself.  He moreover felicitates himself upon\r\nthe fact that his conciliatory course gained him votes.\r\n\r\nThis noted contest lasted eighteen months, as Reynolds says, and, the\r\nState being sparsely populated, he enjoyed the personal acquaintance\r\nof almost every voter.  The fact, as he further states, that his\r\nopponent was a clergyman, was a great drawback to him, and almost all\r\nthe Christian sects, except his own--the anti-missionary Baptists--\r\nopposed him.  With a candor that does him credit, the Judge admits\r\n\"the support of the religious people was not so much _for me,_ but\r\n_against him.\"_\r\n\r\nNo national issues were discussed, but one point urged by Kinney\r\nagainst the proposed Michigan canal was, \"that it would flood\r\nthe country with Yankees.\"  It would be a great mistake to suppose\r\nthat Reynolds himself wholly escaped vituperation.  On the contrary,\r\nhe claims the credit of being \"the best abused man in the State.\"\r\nHe relates that one of the stories told on him was, \"that I saw\r\na scarecrow, the effigy of a man in a corn-field, just at dusk,\r\nand that I said, 'How are you, my friend?  Won't you take some of\r\nmy hand bills to distribute?'\"\r\n\r\nSome light is shed on the politics of the good old days of our\r\nfathers by the following:  \"The party rancor in the campaign raged\r\nso high that neighborhoods fell out with one another, and the angry\r\nand bitter feelings entered into the common transactions of life.\"\r\n\r\nIf the contest had lasted a year or two longer it is not improbably\r\nthat our candidate would have fallen from his high \"reflecting\"\r\nstate to the low level of artful politician.  \"It was the universal\r\ncustom of the times to treat with liquor.  We both did it; but\r\nhe was condemned for it more than myself by the religious community,\r\n_he being a preacher of the Gospel.\"_\r\n\r\nSome atonement, however, is made for the bad whiskey our model\r\ncandidate dispensed by the noble sentiment with which he closes\r\nthis chapter of his contest:  \"I was, and am yet, one of the people,\r\nand every pulsation of our hearts beats in unison.\"\r\n\r\nHaving been elected by a considerable majority as he modestly\r\nremarks, our Governor-elect falls into something of a philosophical\r\ntrain of thought, and horror of politicians and their wiles and\r\nways again possessed him.  He says:\r\n\r\n\"It may be considered vanity and frailty in me, but when I was\r\nelected Governor of the State on fair, honorable principles by the\r\nmasses, without intrigue or management of party or corrupt politicians,\r\nI deemed it the decided approbation of my countrymen, and consequently\r\na great honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe admonition of this sage statesman to the rising generation upon\r\nthe subject of office-seeking, is worthy of profound consideration:\r\n\r\n\"But were I to live over again another life, I think I would have the\r\nmoral courage to refrain from aspiring for any office within the\r\ngift of the people.  By no means do I believe a person should be\r\nsordid and selfish in all his actions, yet cannot a person be more\r\nuseful to the public if he possesses talents in other situations\r\nthan in office?\"\r\n\r\nSome memory of the well-known ingratitude of republics evidently\r\nentered like iron into his very soul when his memoirs were written:\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, a public officer may toil and labor all his best days\r\nwith the utmost fidelity and patriotism, and the masses who reap\r\nthe reward of his labors frequently permit him, without any particular\r\nfault upon his part, to live and die in his old age with disrespect.\r\nWitness the punishment inflicted on Socrates, on our Saviour,\r\nand many others for no crime whatever.  But this contumely and\r\ndisrespect ought not to deter _a good and qualified man_ from\r\nentering the public service, if he is satisfied that the good of\r\nthe country requires it.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point in the career of this eminent public servant, deep\r\nsympathy is aroused on account of the conflict between his humility\r\nand a not very clearly-defined belief that something was due to\r\nthe great office to which he had been elevated.  As preliminary,\r\nhowever, to accomplishing what was for the best interests of the\r\npeople it must not be forgotten that \"my first object was to soften\r\ndown the public mind to its sober senses.\"  That no living man was\r\nbetter qualified for the accomplishment of so praiseworthy a purpose\r\nwill now appear:  \"It has been my opinion of my humble self,\r\nthat whatever small forte I might possess was to conciliate and\r\nsoften down a turbulent and furious people.\"\r\n\r\nThis being all satisfactorily accomplished and the abundant reward\r\nof the peacemaker in sure keeping for this humble instrument,\r\nhis efforts were now directed toward the discharge of the duties\r\nof the office to which he had so unexpectedly been called.\r\n\r\nThat this hitherto unquestioned \"friend of the people\" was now\r\nmanifesting a slight tendency toward the frailties and vanities of\r\nthe common run of men, will appear from the following:\r\n\r\n\"It was my nature not to feel or appear elevated, but I discovered\r\nthat my appearance and deportment, at times, might look like affected\r\nhumility or mock modesty, which I sincerely despised, and then\r\n_I would straighten up a little.\"_\r\n\r\nIt may be truly said of Reynolds, as Macaulay said of Horace Walpole:\r\n\"The conformation of his mind was such that whatever was little\r\nseemed to him great; and whatever was great, seemed to him little.\"\r\n\r\nHaving in his inaugural given expression to the noble sentiment\r\nthat \"proscription for opinion's sake is the worst enemy to the\r\nRepublic,\" he at once generously dispelled whatever apprehensions his\r\nlate opponents might feel as to what was to befall them, by the\r\nassurance:  \"Therefore, all those who honestly and honorably\r\nsupported my respectable opponent in the last election for Governor\r\nshall experience from me no inconvenience on that account.\"\r\nUnfortunately no light is shed upon the interesting inquiry as\r\nto what \"inconvenience\" was experienced by those who had otherwise\r\nthan \"honestly and honorably\" supported his respectable opponent\r\nin the late contest.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hawk War was the principal event of the administration\r\nof Governor Reynolds.  A treaty of peace being concluded, the\r\nIndians were removed beyond the Mississippi River.  In all this\r\nthe Governor acquitted himself with credit.\r\n\r\nThat his aversion to office-holding was in some measure lessening,\r\nwill appear from the following:\r\n\r\n\"Being in the office of Governor for some years, I was prevented\r\nfrom the practice of the law, and in the meantime had been engaged\r\nin public life until it commenced _to be a kind of second nature\r\nto me._  Moreover, I was then young, ardent, and ambitious, so that\r\nI really thought it was right for me to offer for Congress; and\r\nI did so, in the Spring of 1834.\"\r\n\r\nAn \"artful politician\" would probably have waited until the expiration\r\nof his term as Governor.  Not so with this \"friend of the people.\"\r\nHe was not only elected to the next Congress, but the death of the\r\nsitting member for the District creating a vacancy, Reynolds was\r\nof course elected to that also, and was thus at one time Governor of\r\nthe State and member elect both to the next and to the present\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nHis triumph over his \"able and worthy competitor\" is accounted for\r\nin this wise:  \"I was myself tolerably well informed in the science\r\nof electioneering with the masses of the people.  I was raised with\r\nthe people, and was literally one of them.  We always acted together,\r\nand our common instincts, feelings and interests were the same.\"\r\nHe here modestly ventured the opinion that his \"efforts on the\r\nstump, while _making no pretension to classic eloquence,_ yet\r\nflowing naturally from the heart, supplied in them many defects.\"\r\n\r\nA mite of self-approval, tinged with a philosophy which appears to\r\nhave been always kept on tap, closes this chapter of his remarkable\r\ncareer.  He says:\r\n\r\n\"I sincerely state that I never regarded as important the salary\r\nof the office, but I entered public office with a sincere desire\r\nto advance the best interest of the country, which was my main\r\nreward.  If a person would subdue his ambition for office and remain\r\na private citizen, he would be a more happy man.\"\r\n\r\nThat he must have been the most miserable of men, during the greater\r\npart of his long life, clearly appears from the following:  \"There\r\nis no person happy who is in public office, or a candidate for\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\nA more extensive field of usefulness now opened up to the Old Ranger\r\nas he took his seat in Congress.  He had many projects in mind for\r\nthe benefit of the people--one, the reduction of the price of\r\nthe public lands to actual settlers; another, the improvement of\r\nour Western rivers.  But like many other members both before and\r\nsince his day, he found that \"these things were easier to talk\r\nabout on the stump than to do.\"  He candidly admits:  \"This body was\r\nmuch greater than I had supposed, and I could effect much less than\r\nI had contemplated.\"\r\n\r\nHe informs us that he felt like a country boy just from home the\r\nfirst time, as he entered the hall of the law-makers of the\r\ngreat Republic.  The city of Washington, grand and imposing,\r\nimpressed him deeply, but was as the dust in the balance to \"the\r\nassemblage of great men at the seat of Government of the United\r\nStates, and at the opening of Congress, when a grand and really\r\nimposing spectacle was presented.\"\r\n\r\nHis profound admiration for some of his associates upon the broader\r\ntheatre of the public service found vent in the following eloquent\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"When the Roman Empire reached the highest pinnacle of literary\r\nfame and political power in the reign of Augustus Caesar, the period\r\nwas called the Augustan age.  There was a period that existed\r\neminently in the Jackson administration and a few years after that\r\nmight be called the Augustan age of Congress.  So extraordinary\r\na constellation of great and distinguished individuals may never\r\nagain appear in office at the seat of government.\"\r\n\r\nIf apology were needed for the new members' exalted opinion of his\r\nassociates, it can readily be found in the fact that among them in\r\nthe House were John Quincy Adams, John Bell, Thomas F. Marshall,\r\nBen Hardin, James K. Polk, Millard Fillmore, and Franklin Pierce.\r\nThe first named had been President of the United States, and the\r\nlast three were yet to hold that great office.  At the same time\r\n\"the constellation of great stars\" that almost appalled the Illinois\r\nmember upon his introduction included, in the Senate, Crittenden, Wright,\r\nCass, Woodbury, Preston, Buchanan, Grundy, Benton, Clay, Calhoun, and\r\nWebster.\r\n\r\nOn finally taking leave of Congress, our member congratulates\r\nhimself that during seven years of service he was absent from\r\nhis seat but a single day.  That all his humble endeavors were\r\nin the interest of the people, of course, goes without saying.  He\r\ndeprecates in strong terms the extravagance of some members of\r\nCongress in allowing their expenses to exceed their salaries,\r\nand then leaving the capital in debt.  That he did nothing of\r\nthe kind, but practised economy in all his expenses, it is\r\nhardly necessary to state.  He is not, however, entitled to a patent\r\nfor the discovery that \"the expenses for living at the seat of\r\nGovernment of the United States are heavy.\"\r\n\r\nBeing a widower, conditions were now favorable for a little romance\r\nto be mingled with the dull cares of state.  Near the close of his\r\nlast term, he says:  \"I became acquainted with a lady in the District\r\nof Columbia, and we, in consideration of mutual love and affection,\r\nmarried.  The same tie binds us in matrimonial happiness to the\r\npresent time.\"  He here admits a fact that might at this later day\r\nsubject him to Executive displeasure:  \"Posterity will have an\r\nunsettled account against us for having _added nothing to the great\r\nreservoir of the human family.\"_\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to know that while in Congress our member\r\nhumbly accepted the appointment tendered him by Governor Carlin as\r\nCommissioner to negotiate the Illinois and Michigan Canal bonds.\r\nHis earnest desire to have some one else appointed availed nothing,\r\nand in the interest of the great enterprise, upon the success of\r\nwhich the future of the State seemed to hang, he spent the summer of\r\n1839 in Europe.  While his mission abroad was fruitless as to\r\nits immediate object, it is gratifying to know that our commissioner\r\nreturned duly impressed with \"the immense superiority in every\r\npossible manner of our own country, and all its glorious institutions,\r\nover those of the monarchies of the old world.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to suppose that the retirement of the Old Ranger from\r\nCongress was to terminate his career of usefulness to the people.\r\nOn the contrary, he says:  \"In 1846, I was elected a member from\r\nSt. Clair County to the General Assembly of the State.  The main\r\nobject of myself and friends was to obtain a charter for a macadamized\r\nroad from Belleville to the Mississippi River, opposite St. Louis.\"\r\n\r\nThis all satisfactorily accomplished, and the Legislature adjourned,\r\n\"I turned my time and attention to the calm and quiet of life.\r\nWith my choice library of one thousand volumes I indulged in the\r\nstudy of science and literature.  I soon discovered that the bustle\r\nand turmoil of political life did not produce happiness.\"\r\n\r\nSad to relate, this faithful public servant, worn with the cares\r\nof state, was not even yet permitted to lay aside his armor.\r\nThe happiness of private life, for which his soul yearned as the\r\nhart panteth for the water brooks, was again postponed for the\r\nhated bustle and turmoil of politics.  In 1852, against his\r\nremonstrances, he was again elected to the Legislature, and upon\r\nthe organization of the House unanimously chosen Speaker.\r\n\r\nReluctantly indeed, we now take leave of John Reynolds--the quaintest\r\nof all the odd characters this country of ours has known.  In doing\r\nso, it is indeed a comfort to know that, true as the needle to the\r\npole, his great heart continued to beat in unison with that of the\r\npeople.  Ascending the Speaker's stand, and lifting the gavel, with\r\ndeep emotion he said--and these are to us his last words:  \"I have\r\nnothing to labor for but the public good.  My life has been devoted\r\nto promote the public interest of Illinois, and in my latter days it\r\nwill afford me profound pleasure to advance now, as I have always done\r\nin the past, _the best interests of the people.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\nTHE MORMON EXODUS FROM ILLINOIS\r\n\r\nDELEGATE CANNON AND SENATOR CANNON, MORMONS--SKETCH OF MORMONISM\r\nBY GOVERNOR FORD--JOSEPH SMITH'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF\r\nHIS CHURCH--HOW \"THE BOOK OF MORMON\" WAS MADE--NAUVOO, \"THE HOLY\r\nCITY\"--EFFORTS OF WHIGS AND DEMOCRATS TO WIN THE VOTES OF THE\r\nMORMONS--VICTORY OF THE DEMOCRATS, AND CONSEQUENT ANTI-MORMONISM\r\nOF THE WHIGS--JOSEPH SMITH'S PRETENSIONS TO ROYALTY--THE ORIGIN OF\r\nPOLYGAMY IN THE MORMON CHURCH--CONFLICT WITH THE STATE AUTHORITIES\r\n--SURRENDER OF THE LEADERS--ASSASSINATION OF SMITH--BRIGHAM\r\nYOUNG CHOSEN AS HIS SUCCESSOR--THE EXODUS BEGINS.\r\n\r\nJust across the aisle from my seat in the House of Representatives\r\nduring the forty-sixth Congress sat George Q. Cannon, the delegate\r\nfrom the Territory of Utah.  He held this position for many years,\r\nand possessed in the highest degree the confidence of the Mormon\r\npeople.  Fifteen years later, when presiding over the Senate, I\r\nadministered the oath of office to his son, the Hon. Frank J.\r\nCannon, the first chosen to represent the State of Utah in the Upper\r\nChamber of the National Congress.  Senator Cannon was then in high\r\nfavor with \"the powers that be\" in Salt Lake City, but for some\r\ncause not well understood by the Gentile world, is now _persona\r\nnon grata_ with the head of the Mormon Church.  The younger Cannon\r\nwas not a polygamist, and no objection was urged to his being seated\r\nupon the presentation of his credentials as a Senator.  His father,\r\nthe delegate, was in theory a polygamist, and had \"the courage\r\nof his convictions\" to the extent of being the husband of five\r\nwives, and the head of as many separate households.  This,\r\nbefore the days of \"unfriendly legislation,\" was, in Mormon\r\nparlance, called \"living your religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe delegate and the Senator were both men of ability, and possessed\r\nin large degree the respect of their associates.  The former was\r\nin early youth a resident of Illinois, and was of the advance guard\r\nof the Mormon exodus to the valley of the Great Salt Lake soon\r\nafter the assassination of the \"prophet.\"  When I first visited\r\nSalt Lake City, in 1879, George Q. Cannon, in addition to being\r\nthe delegate in Congress, was one of the \"Quorum of the Twelve,\"\r\nand was in the line of succession to the presidency of the Church.\r\nFrom him I learned much that was of interest concerning the history\r\nand tenets of the Mormon people.  The venerable John Taylor was\r\nthen the president of the Church, the immediate successor of Brigham\r\nYoung.  He was in early life a resident with his people in Nauvoo,\r\nIllinois, and was a prisoner in the Carthage jail with the \"Prophet\r\nJoseph\" at the time of his assassination, in 1844.  President Taylor\r\ngave me a graphic description of that now historic tragedy, and of\r\nhis own narrow escape from the fate of his idolized leader.\r\n\r\nA brief notice of this singular people, and of what they did and\r\nsuffered in Illinois, may not be wholly without interest.  Mormonism\r\nwas the apple of discord in the State during almost the entire\r\nofficial term of the late Governor Ford.  More than one little army\r\nwas, during that period, sent into Hancock County--\"the Mormon\r\ncountry\"--to suppress disturbances and maintain public order.\r\n\r\nGovernor Ford says:\r\n\r\n\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, as this organization\r\nis denominated by its adherents, is to be viewed from the antagonistic\r\nGentile and Mormon standpoints.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church and its prophet,\r\nwas born in Vermont, in 1805, of obscure parentage.  His early\r\neducation was extremely limited.  When he first began to act the\r\nprophet, he was ignorant of almost everything which pertained to\r\nscience; but he made up in natural cunning for many deficiencies\r\nof education.  At the age of ten, he was taken by his father to\r\nWayne County, New York, where his youth was spent in an idle,\r\nvagabond life, roaming the woods, dreaming of buried treasures,\r\nand exerting himself to find them by the twisting of a forked stick\r\nin his hands, or by looking through enchanted stones.  He and\r\nhis father were 'water witchers,' always ready to point out the\r\nexact points where wells could be successfully dug.  While leading\r\nan idle, profligate life, Joseph Smith became acquainted with Sidney\r\nRigdon, a man of talents and great plausibility.  Rigdon was the\r\npossessor of a religious romance written some years before by a\r\nPresbyterian clergyman.  The perusal of this book suggested to\r\nSmith and Rigdon the idea of starting a new religion.  By them a\r\nstory was accordingly devised to the effect that golden plates had\r\nbeen found buried near Palmyra, New York, containing a record\r\ninscribed on them in unknown characters, which, when deciphered by\r\nthe power of inspiration, gave the history of the ten lost tribes of\r\nIsrael in their wanderings through Asia into America, where they\r\nhad settled and flourished, and where, in due time, Christ came\r\nand preached the Gospel to them, appointed his twelve Apostles,\r\nand was crucified here, nearly in the same manner he had been in\r\nJerusalem.  The record then pretended to give the history of the\r\nAmerican Christians for a few hundred years until the wickedness\r\nof the people called down the judgment of God upon them, which\r\nresulted in their extermination.  Several nations from the Isthmus\r\nof Darien to the northern extremity of the continent were engaged in\r\ncontinual warfare.  The culmination of all this was the battle\r\nof Cumorah, fought many centuries ago near the present site of\r\nPalmyra, between the Lamanites and the Nephites--the former being the\r\nheathen and the latter the Christians of this continent.  In\r\nthis battle, in which hundreds of thousands were slain, the Nephites\r\nperished from the earth, except a remnant, who escaped to the\r\nsouthern country.  Among this number was Mormon, a righteous man\r\nwho was divinely directed to make a record of these important events\r\non plates of gold, and who buried them in the earth, to be\r\ndiscovered in future times.  'The Book of Mormon'--none other than\r\nthe religious romance above mentioned--is the pretended translation\r\nof the hieroglyphics said to have been inscribed on the golden\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n\"The account given of himself by the 'prophet' is of far different\r\ntenor from the one just given.  While yet a youth he became greatly\r\nconcerned in regard to his soul's salvation; and being deeply\r\nagonized in spirit, he sought divine guidance.  While fervently\r\nengaged in supplication, his mind was taken away from the surrounding\r\nobjects and enwrapped in a heavenly vision, and he saw two glorious\r\npersonages similar in form and features and surrounded with a\r\nbrilliant light, outshining the sun at noonday.  He was then informed\r\nby these glorious personages that all religious denominations were\r\nin error, and were not acknowledged of God as His church and kingdom,\r\nand that he, Joseph, was expressly commanded not to go after them.\r\nAt the same time, he received a promise that the fulness of the\r\nGospel should at some future time be known to him.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on the evening of September 23, 1823, at the hour of\r\nsix, while he was engaged in prayer, suddenly a light like that of\r\nday, only far more pure and glorious, burst into the room, as though\r\nthe house were filled with fire, and a personage stood before\r\nhim surrounded with a glory far greater than he had yet seen.  This\r\nmessenger proclaimed himself to be an angel of God, sent with\r\nthe joyful tidings that the covenant which God had made with ancient\r\nIsrael was about to be fulfilled; that the preparatory work for\r\nthe second coming of Messiah was speedily to commence; that the\r\ntime was at hand for the Gospel to be proclaimed in all its fulness\r\nand power to all nations, to the end that a peculiar people might\r\nbe prepared for the millennial reign.  He was further informed that\r\nhe, Joseph, was to be the instrument in God's hand to bring about this\r\nglorious dispensation.  The angel also informed him in regard to\r\nthe American Indians, who they were, and whence they came, with\r\na sketch of their origin, progress, civilization, righteousness,\r\nand iniquity, and why the blessing of God had been withdrawn\r\nfrom them as a people.  He was also told where certain plates were\r\ndeposited, whereon were engraved the records of the ancient prophets,\r\nwho once existed on this continent.  And then, to wit, on the last\r\nday mentioned, the angel of the Lord delivered into his hands the\r\nrecords mentioned, which were engraved on plates which had the\r\nappearance of gold.  They were filled with engravings in\r\nEgyptian characters and bound together in a volume as the leaves\r\nof a book; with the records was found a curious instrument which\r\nthe ancients called \"Urim and Thummim,\" which consisted of two\r\ntransparent stones set in the rim of a bow fastened to a breastplate.\r\nBy the instrumentality of the Urim and Thummim, Joseph was enabled\r\nto translate the hieroglyphics aforementioned.\r\n\r\nThus translated, the records mentioned became \"The Book of Mormon.\"\r\nThe last of the ancient prophets had inscribed these records upon the\r\ngolden plates by the command of God, and deposited them in the\r\nearth, where, fifteen centuries later, they were divinely revealed\r\nto Joseph Smith.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that the golden plates are still in existence,\r\nbut that after being translated by Joseph Smith, by the aid of the\r\nwonderful instrument mentioned, they were re-delivered to the angel.\r\nThe non-production of the plates thus satisfactorily explained,\r\nand secondary evidence being admissible, eleven witnesses appeared\r\nand testified to having actually seen the plates; three of the\r\nnumber further declaring that they were present when Joseph received\r\nthe plates at the hands of the angel.\r\n\r\nUpon my giving expression, to a high Mormon official, of some\r\nlingering doubts as to the absolute authenticity of the above\r\nnarrative, I was significantly reminded of the words of the immortal\r\nbard:\r\n\r\n  \"Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,\r\n  Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.\"\r\n\r\nAt all events, upon the pretended revelations mentioned, Joseph\r\nSmith as \"prophet\" founded the Church of the Latter-Day Saints,\r\nnear Palmyra, New York, in 1830.  Nor did he lack for followers.\r\nThe eleven witnesses mentioned, and others, were commissioned\r\nand sent forth to proclaim the new gospel, and disciples in\r\nlarge numbers soon flocked to the standard of the \"prophet.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of delusions from the days of Mahomet to the present\r\ntime illustrates the eagerness with which men are ever ready to\r\nseek out new inventions and to discard the old beliefs for the new.\r\nThere is no tenet so monstrous but in some breast it will find\r\nlodgment.\r\n\r\n  \"In religion\r\n  What damned error, but some sober brow\r\n  Will bless it and approve it with a text.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1833, Mormon colonies were established at Kirtland, Ohio, and\r\nin Jackson County, Missouri, but, owing to Gentile persecution,\r\nthe \"saints\" at length shook the dust of those unhallowed localities\r\nfrom their feet, and settled in large numbers in Hancock County,\r\nIllinois.  Here they built Nauvoo, the \"Holy City,\" \"the beautiful\r\nhabitation for man.\"  The Mormon historian says:  \"The surrounding\r\nlands were purchased by the saints, and a town laid out, which was\r\nnamed 'Nauvoo' from the Hebrew, which signifies fair, very beautiful,\r\nand it actually fills the definition of the words, for nature\r\nhas not formed a parallel anywhere on the banks of the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nThe sacred city, as it was called, soon contained a population\r\nof fifteen thousand souls, gathered from all quarters of the globe.\r\nHere were built the home of the prophet, the hall of the seventies,\r\na concert hall, and other public institutions.  Chief among\r\nthese buildings was the Temple, described by the same historian as\r\n\"glistening in white limestone upon the hilltops, a shrine in\r\nthe wilderness whereat all the nations of the earth may worship,\r\nwhereat all the people may inquire of God and receive His holy\r\noracles.\"\r\n\r\nThis temple, erected at a cost of nearly a million dollars, was at\r\na later day visited by Governor Reynolds, and is thus described by\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\"I was in the Mormon temple at Nauvoo.  It was a large and splendid\r\nedifice, built in the Egyptian style of architecture; and its\r\ngrandeur and magnificence truly astonished me.  It was erected\r\non the top of the Mississippi bluff, which has a prospect which\r\nreached as far as the eye could extend over the country and up and\r\ndown the river.  The most singular appendage of this splendid\r\nedifice was the font in which the immersion of the saints was\r\npractised.  It was composed of marble.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Mormon emigration to Illinois, in 1839, the Whig\r\nand Democratic parties in the State were in a heated struggle\r\nfor supremacy.  The respective party leaders at once realized that\r\nthe new importation of voters might be the controlling political\r\nfactor in the State.  To conciliate the Mormons and gain their\r\nsupport soon became the aim of the politicians.  This fact is\r\nthe keynote to the statement of Governor Ford:\r\n\r\n\"A city charter drawn up to suit the Mormons was presented to\r\nthe Legislature.  No one opposed it, but both parties were active in\r\ngetting it through.  This charter, and others passed in the same\r\nmanner, incorporated Nauvoo, provided for the election of a mayor,\r\nfour aldermen, and nine councillors, and gave them power to pass\r\nall ordinances necessary for the benefit of the city which were\r\nnot repugnant to the Constitution.  This seemed to give them power\r\nto pass ordinances in violation of the laws of the State, and to\r\nerect a system of government for themselves.  This charter also\r\nincorporated the Nauvoo Legion,--entirely independent of the military\r\norganization of the State, and not subject to the commands of\r\nits officers.  Provision was also made for a court-martial for the\r\nLegion, to be composed of its own officers; and in the exercise of\r\ntheir duties they were not bound to regard the laws of the State.\r\nThus it was proposed to establish for the Mormons a Government\r\nwithin a Government, a Legislature with power to pass ordinances\r\nat war with the laws of the State.  These charters were unheard\r\nof, anti-republican and capable of infinite abuse.  The great law of\r\nthe separation of the powers of government was wholly disregarded.\r\nThe mayor was at once the executive power, the judiciary, and part\r\nof the Legislature.  One would have thought that these charters\r\nstood a poor chance of passing the Legislature of a republican\r\npeople, jealous of their liberties, nevertheless they did pass both\r\nHouses unanimously.  Each party was afraid to object to them,\r\nfor fear of losing the Mormon vote.\"\r\n\r\nSome indications of the hopes and fears of party leaders may be\r\ngleaned from the statement of the politic John Reynolds, then a\r\nrepresentative in Congress.  He thus speaks of the visit of Joseph\r\nSmith to the national capital:\r\n\r\n\"I had recently received letters that Smith was a very important\r\ncharacter in Illinois, and to give him the civilities that were\r\ndue him.  He stood at the time fair and honorable, except his\r\nfanaticism on religion.  The sympathies of the people were in\r\nhis favor.  It fell to my lot to introduce him to the President,\r\nand one morning the Prophet Smith and I called at the White House to\r\nsee the chief magistrate.  When we were about to enter the apartments\r\nof President Van Buren, the prophet asked me to introduce him as\r\na Latter-day Saint.  It was so unexpected and so strange to me that\r\nI could scarcely believe he would urge such nonsense on this occasion\r\nto the President.  But he repeated the request, and I introduced\r\nhim as a Latter-day Saint, which made the President smile.  The\r\nProphet remained in Washington a greater part of the winter, and\r\npreached often.  I became well acquainted with him.  He was a person\r\nrather larger than ordinary stature, well proportioned, and\r\nwould weigh about one hundred and eighty pounds.  He was rather\r\nfleshy, but was in his appearance, amiable and benevolent.  He did\r\nnot appear to possess barbarity in his nature, nor to possess that\r\ngreat talent and boundless mind that would enable him to accomplish\r\nthe wonders he performed.\"\r\n\r\nReferring again to the narrative of Ford:\r\n\r\n\"Joseph Smith was duly installed Mayor of Nauvoo--this _Imperium\r\nin Imperio_--he was _ex-officio_ Judge of the Mayor's court, and\r\nChief Justice of the Municipal court; and in this capacity he was to\r\ninterpret the laws he had assisted to make.  The Nauvoo Legion was\r\norganized with a multitude of high officers.  It was divided\r\ninto divisions, brigades, cohorts, battalions, and companies;\r\nand Joseph Smith as Lieutenant-General was the Commander-in-Chief.\r\nThe common council of Nauvoo passed many ordinances for the punishment\r\nof crime.  The punishment was generally different from, and much\r\nmore severe than, that provided by the laws of the State.\"\r\n\r\nThat any Legislature would ever, under any stress of circumstances,\r\nhave conferred--or have attempted to confer--such powers upon a\r\nmunicipality is beyond comprehension.  The statement, if unsustained\r\nby the official State records, would now challenge belief.\r\n\r\nUnder the favorable conditions mentioned, the Mormons were now upon\r\nthe high wave of prosperity in Illinois.  Their number had increased\r\nto more than twenty thousand in Hancock and the counties adjoining.\r\nThe owners of large tracts of valuable land, protected by legislation\r\nthat finds no parallel in any State, courted by the leaders of both\r\nparties, and actually holding for a time the balance of political power\r\nin the State--they seemed indeed to be \"the chosen people,\" as\r\nclaimed by their prophet.\r\n\r\nIt needed no prophet, however, to foretell that this could not long\r\ncontinue.  The Mormon leaders failed to realize that to champion\r\nthe cause of either party would of necessity arouse the fierce\r\nhostility of the other, as in very truth it did.  Politics, the\r\nprime cause of fortune's favors to them in the beginning, proved\r\ntheir undoing in the end.\r\n\r\nJoseph Smith had, soon after his removal from Missouri, been arrested\r\nupon a requisition from the Governor of that State.  From this\r\narrest he was discharged when brought upon a writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nbefore Judge Pope, a Whig.  The ground of the decision was, that\r\nas Smith was not in Missouri at the time of the attempt upon the\r\nlife of Governor Boggs, and that whatever he did--if he did anything\r\n--to aid or encourage the attempt, was done in Illinois, and not\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of Missouri laws, he was not a fugitive\r\nfrom justice within the provision of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.  The decision excited much comment at the time, but, as\r\nstated by Judge Blodgett, it \"has borne the test of criticism, and\r\nis now the accepted rule of law in interstate extradition cases.\"\r\n\r\nThis for a time inclined the Mormons to the support of the Whig\r\nparty.  Again arrested, the prophet, under similar proceedings,\r\nwas discharged by a Democratic Judge.  This, as Governor Ford says,\r\n\r\n\"Induced Smith to issue a proclamation to his followers declaring Judge\r\nDouglas to be a master spirit, and exhorting them to vote for\r\nthe Democratic ticket for Governor.  Smith was too ignorant to know\r\nwhether he owed his discharge to the law or to party favor.  Such was\r\nthe ignorance of the Mormons generally, that they thought anything\r\nto be law which they thought expedient.  All action of the Government\r\nunfavorable to them they looked upon as wantonly oppressive, and\r\nwhen the law was administered in their favor they attributed it to\r\npartiality and kindness.\"\r\n\r\nThe last hope of the Whigs for Mormon support was abandoned in\r\n1843.  In the district of which Hancock County was a part, the\r\nopposing candidates for Congress were Joseph P. Hoge, Democrat,\r\nand Cyrus Walker, Whig, both lawyers of distinction.  The latter\r\nhad been counsel for Smith in the Habeas Corpus proceedings last\r\nmentioned.  Grateful for the services then rendered, Smith\r\nopenly espoused the candidacy of Walker in the pending contest.\r\nThat there were tricks in politics even more than sixty years ago,\r\nwill now appear.  One Backinstos, a politician of Hancock County,\r\ndeclared upon his return from the State capital that he had assurances\r\nfrom the Governor that the Mormons would be amply protected as long\r\nas they voted the Democratic ticket.  It is hardly necessary to\r\nsay that the Governor denied having given any such assurance.\r\nHowever, the campaign lie of Backinstos, like many of its kind\r\nbefore and since, proved a \"good enough Morgan till after the\r\nelection.\"  This, it will be remembered, was before the days of\r\nrailroads and telegraphs, and the Mormon settlement was far remote\r\nfrom the seat of government.  A partisan jumble, in which the\r\n\"saints\" were the participants, and the low arts of the demagogues\r\nand pretended revelations from God the chief ingredients, is\r\nthus described by the historian just quoted:\r\n\r\n\"The mission of Backinstos produced an entire change in the minds of\r\nthe Mormon leaders.  They now resolved to drop their friend Walker\r\nand take up Hoge, the Democratic candidate.  A great meeting of\r\nseveral thousand Mormons was held the Saturday before the election.\r\nHiram Smith, patriarch and brother of the prophet, appeared in this\r\nassembly and there solemnly announced to the people, that God\r\nhad revealed to him that the Mormons must support Mr. Hoge.  William\r\nLaw, another leader, next appeared and denied that the Lord had\r\nmade any such revelation.  He stated that to his certain knowledge\r\nthe prophet Joseph was in favor of Mr. Walker, and that the prophet\r\nwas more likely to know the mind of the Lord than the patriarch.\r\nHiram again repeated his revelation, with a greater tone of authority,\r\nbut the people remained in doubt until the next day, Sunday, when the\r\nprophet Joseph himself appeared before the assemblage.  He there\r\nstated that he himself was in favor of Mr. Walker and intended\r\nto vote for him; that he would not, if he could, influence any man\r\nin giving his vote; that he considered it a mean business for\r\nany man to dictate to the people whom they should vote for; that\r\nhe had heard his brother Hiram had received a revelation from\r\nthe Lord on the subject; but for his own part, he did not much\r\nbelieve in revelations on the subject of election.  Brother Hiram was,\r\nhowever, a man of truth; he had known him intimately ever since he\r\nwas a boy, and he had never known him to tell a lie.  If brother\r\nHiram said he had received a revelation he had no doubt he had.\r\nWhen the Lord speaks let all the earth be silent.\"\r\n\r\nThat the prophet Joseph well understood how to\r\n\r\n  \"By indirections find directions out,\"\r\n\r\nclearly appears from his cunning expression of faith in the pretended\r\nrevelation of the patriarch Hiram.  The effect of this speech\r\nwas far-reaching.  It turned the entire Mormon vote to Hoge, thereby\r\nsecuring his election to Congress, and at once placed the Whigs in\r\nthe ranks of the implacable anti-Mormon party then in process of\r\nrapid formation.  The crusade that now began for the expulsion\r\nof the Mormons from the State, was greatly augmented by acts of\r\nunparalleled folly upon their own part.  In order to protect their\r\nleaders from arrest, it was decreed by the City Council of Nauvoo\r\nthat no writ unless issued and approved by its Mayor should be\r\nexecuted within the sacred city, and that any officer attempting\r\nto execute a writ otherwise issued, within the city, should be\r\nsubject to imprisonment for life, and that the pardoning power\r\nof the Governor of the State was in such case suspended.  This\r\nordinance when published created great astonishment and indignation.\r\nThe belief became general that the Mormons were about to set up\r\nfor themselves a separate Government wholly independent of that of\r\nthe State.  This belief was strengthened by the presentation of\r\na petition to Congress praying for the establishment of a\r\nTerritorial Government for Nauvoo and vicinity.\r\n\r\nApparently oblivious of the gathering storm, Joseph Smith early in\r\n1844 committed his crowning act of folly by announcing himself a\r\ncandidate for the high office of President of the United States.\r\nNot only this, but as stated by Governor Ford,\r\n\r\n\"Smith now conceived the idea of making himself a temporal Prince as\r\nwell as the spiritual leader of his people.  He instituted a new\r\nand select order of the priesthood, the members of which were to\r\nbe priests and kings, temporal and spiritual.  These were to be\r\nthe nobility, the upholders of his throne.  He caused himself to\r\nbe crowned and anointed king and priest far above all others.\r\nTo uphold his pretensions to royalty, he deduced his descent by an\r\nunbroken chain from Joseph, the son of Jacob, and that of his wife\r\nfrom some other renowned personage of Old Testament history.\r\nThe Mormons openly denounced the Government of the United States, as\r\nbeing utterly corrupt, and about to pass away and be replaced by\r\nthe government of God, to be administered by his servant Joseph.\r\nIt is at this day certain, also, that about this time, the prophet\r\ninstituted an order in the Church called the Danite Band.  This\r\nwas to be a body-guard about the person of their sovereign, sworn to\r\nobey his commands as those of God himself.\"\r\n\r\nDuring late years a war of words has been waged within the\r\nMormon church over the question of the responsibility of the prophet\r\nJoseph for the introduction of polygamy as a cardinal tenet of its\r\ncreed.  The son of the prophet, it will be remembered, led a revolt\r\nagainst Brigham Young, soon after the succession of the latter\r\nto the presidency of the Church, and is now at the head of the\r\nMormon establishment at Plano, Illinois.  This branch of the Church\r\nrejects the dogma of polygamy, declaring it to be utterly repugnant\r\nto the divine revelation to Joseph, and to early Mormon belief and\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nUpon the contrary, the main body in Utah--of which Joseph F. Smith\r\nthe nephew of the prophet and son of Hiram the patriarch is now\r\nthe president--found their belief in the divine character of their\r\npeculiar institution upon alleged revelations direct from God to\r\nthe founder of the Church.  The statement of Governor Ford, written\r\nnearly sixty years ago, sheds some light upon this controversy:\r\n\r\n\"A doctrine was now revealed that no woman could get to heaven\r\nexcept as the wife of a Mormon elder.  The elders were allowed\r\nto have as many of these wives as they could maintain; and it was\r\na doctrine of the Church that any female could be 'sealed up to\r\neternal life' by uniting herself as wife to the elder of her choice.\r\nThis doctrine was maintained by appeal to the Old Testament scriptures\r\nand by the example of Abraham and Jacob and Daniel and Solomon,\r\nthe favorites of God in a former age of the world.\"\r\n\r\nAs the necessary result of the causes mentioned, the followers\r\nof the prophet soon found themselves bitterly antagonized by almost\r\nthe whole anti-Mormon population of the \"Military Tract.\"  Charges\r\nand counter-charges were made, the arrest of the leaders of the\r\nopposing parties followed in rapid succession, and outrages and\r\nriots were of daily occurrence.  Public meetings were held; all\r\nthe crimes known to the calendar were charged against the Mormons,\r\nand resolutions passed demanding their immediate expulsion from the\r\nState.  What is known in Illinois history as the \"Mormon war\"\r\nfollowed closely in the wake of the events just mentioned.  Innocent\r\npersons were, in many instances, the victims of the folly and of\r\nthe crimes of unprincipled and brutal leaders.\r\n\r\nThe events of this period constitute a dark chapter in the history\r\nof the State--one that can be recalled only with feelings of horror.\r\nThe great body of citizens, it is needless to say, favored the\r\nrigid maintenance of order and the protection of life and property;\r\nbut it was the very heyday for the lawless and vicious element\r\nof all parties.\r\n\r\nThat this condition of affairs could not long continue was manifest.\r\nThe bloody termination, however, came in a manner unexpected to\r\nall.  Two of the Mormon leaders, William and Wilson Law, were,\r\nat the time mentioned, in open revolt against the newly-assumed\r\npowers and the alleged practices of the prophet.  To strengthen\r\ntheir opposition they procured a printing-press and equipment, and\r\nissued from their office in Nauvoo one number of a small weekly,\r\n\"The Expositor.\"  By order of the Mayor, Smith, and decree of\r\nthe Council, the press was seized and destroyed, and the Law brothers\r\nand their few adherents compelled to flee the Holy City.  Immediately\r\nupon their arrival at Carthage, they caused warrants to be issued for\r\nthe arrest of Joseph and Hiram Smith, John Taylor, and others, for\r\nthe destruction of the printing-press.  The almost sovereign powers\r\npreviously conferred upon the city of Nauvoo now play an important\r\npart in this drama.  The persons arrested, as above mentioned, were\r\nat once brought by writs of _habeas corpus,_ issued by the Mayor\r\nof Nauvoo, before the Municipal Court and there promptly discharged.\r\nGovernor Ford, whose righteous soul had been vexed to the limit of\r\nendurance by unmerited abuse from Mormon and Gentile alike from\r\nthe beginning of this controversy, here indulges in a few expressions\r\nof justifiable irony.  Of these proceedings he says:\r\n\r\n\"It clearly appeared both from the complaints of the citizens\r\nand the admissions of the Mormons, that the whole proceedings of\r\nthe Mayor, Council, and Municipal Court were illegal and not to be\r\nendured in a free country; but some apology might be made for\r\nthe court, as it had been repeatedly assured by some of the ablest\r\nlawyers in the State of both political parties, when candidates\r\nbefore that people, that it had full and complete power to issue\r\nwrits of _habeas corpus_ in all cases whatever.\"\r\n\r\n  \"In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,\r\n  But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,\r\n  Obscures the show of evil.\"\r\n\r\nThe incidents mentioned added quickly fuel to the flame.  A new\r\nwarrant was issued by a magistrate in Carthage for the arrest of\r\nthe Mormon leaders and placed in the hands of an officer of the\r\nState for execution.  The latter at once summoned the citizens\r\nof the county, as a _posse comitatus,_ to aid in the arrests.\r\nAt this critical moment Governor Ford, in the interest of peace,\r\nreached Carthage, the county seat.  Upon his arrival he found\r\nthe situation truly alarming.  Several hundred armed men from\r\nthe country around had hastily assembled and were encamped upon\r\nthe public square.  By order of the Governor, this force was\r\norganized into companies and placed under the immediate command of\r\nofficers of his appointment.  At the conclusion of a speech by the\r\nGovernor, the officers and men pledged themselves to aid him in\r\nupholding the laws, and in protecting the Mormon prisoners when\r\nbrought to Carthage for trial.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Smith as lieutenant-general had called out the Nauvoo\r\nLegion and proclaimed martial law in that city.  The Mormons from the\r\ncountry promptly obeyed the call of their leader and marched to\r\nhis assistance, and Nauvoo became at once a vast military camp.\r\nGovernor Ford now demanded of the Mormon leaders the return of the\r\nState arms furnished at the time of the organization of the Legion,\r\nthis demand, if not promptly complied with, to be enforced by an\r\nimmediate attack upon Nauvoo by the assembled forces encamped at\r\nCarthage.\r\n\r\nAppreciating now for the first time the hopelessness of a conflict\r\nwith State authorities, a number of the weapons were surrendered\r\nand the Smiths, accompanied by Taylor and Richards, two other Mormon\r\nleaders, went to Carthage and surrendered themselves to the officer\r\nholding the warrant for their arrest.  Upon giving bond for their\r\nappearance, they were at once released on charge of riot.  A new\r\ncomplaint, charging them with treason--in levying war against\r\nthe State, declaring martial law in Nauvoo, and ordering out the\r\nLegion to resist the execution of lawful process--was immediately lodged\r\nagainst them, a warrant duly issued, the prisoners rearrested\r\nand committed to the common jail of the county.  On the evening\r\nfollowing this arrest, the guards stationed at the jail for the\r\nprotection of the prisoners were attacked and overpowered by a mob\r\nof several hundred persons.  Governor Ford states:\r\n\r\n\"An attempt was now made to break open the door; but Joseph Smith,\r\nbeing armed with a six-barrel pistol furnished by his friends,\r\nfired several times as the door was burst open and wounded three\r\nof the assailants.  At the same time, several shots were fired into\r\nthe room, wounding John Taylor and killing Hiram Smith.  Joseph\r\nSmith now attempted to escape by jumping out of the second-story\r\nwindow; but the fall so stunned him that he was unable to rise,\r\nand being placed by the conspirators in a sitting posture, they\r\ndespatched him by four balls shot through his body.\"\r\n\r\nThus perished, at the age of thirty-nine, the founder and prophet of\r\nthe Mormon Church.  Contradictory statements as to his real character\r\nhave come down to the present generation.  The estimate of Governor\r\nFord, who knew him well, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"He was the most successful impostor in modern times; a man who,\r\nthough ignorant and coarse, had some great natural parts which\r\nfitted him for temporary success, but which were so obscured and\r\ncounteracted by the inherent corruptness of his nature that he\r\nnever could succeed in establishing a system of policy which looked\r\nto permanent success in the future.  It must not be supposed that the\r\npretended prophet practised the tricks of a common impostor; that he\r\nwas a dark and gloomy person with a long beard, a grave and severe\r\naspect, and a reserved and saintly carriage of his person.  On the\r\ncontrary, he was full of levity, even to boyish romping; dressed\r\nlike a dandy, and at times drank like a sailor and swore like a\r\npirate.  He could, as occasion required, be exceedingly meek in\r\nhis deportment, and then, again, be as rough and boisterous as a\r\nhighway robber; being always able to prove to his followers the\r\npropriety of his conduct.  He always quailed before power, and was\r\narrogant to weakness.  At times he could put on an air of a penitent,\r\nas if feeling the deepest humility for his sins, and suffering\r\nunutterable anguish, and indulging in the most gloomy foreboding of\r\neternal woe.  At such times he would call for the prayers of the\r\nbrethren in his behalf with a wild and fearful anxiety and\r\nearnestness.  He was six feet high, strongly built, and uncommonly\r\nfull muscled.  No doubt he was as much indebted for his influence\r\nover an ignorant people to the superiority of his physical vigor as\r\nto his great cunning and intellect.\"\r\n\r\nOf a wholly different tenor is the tribute of Parley P. Pratt, the\r\npoet and historian of the Mormon Church:\r\n\r\n\"President Smith was in person tall and well built, strong and\r\nactive; of a light complexion, light hair, blue eyes, and of an\r\nexpression peculiar to himself, on which the eye naturally rested with\r\ninterest and was never weary of beholding.  His countenance was\r\nvery mild, affable, and beaming with intelligence and benevolence mingled\r\nwith a look of interest and an unconscious smile of cheerfulness, and\r\nentirely free from all restraint or affectation of gravity; and\r\nthere was something connected with the serene and steady penetrating\r\nglance of his eye, as if he would penetrate the deepest abyss of\r\nthe human heart, gaze into eternity, penetrate the heavens, and\r\ncomprehend all worlds.  He possessed a noble boldness and independence\r\nof character; his manner was easy and familiar, his rebuke terrible\r\nas the lion, his benevolence unbounded as the ocean, his\r\nintelligence universal, and his language abounding in original\r\neloquence peculiar to himself.\"\r\n\r\nFor a brief period following the assassination of the Smiths,\r\ncomparative quiet prevailed in the Mormon country.  The selection of\r\na successor to their murdered prophet, was now the absorbing question\r\namong the Mormon people.  Revelations were published that the\r\nprophet, in imitation of the Saviour, was to rise from the dead,\r\nand some even reported that they had seen him attended by a celestial\r\narmy coursing the air on a great white horse.\r\n\r\nSydney Rigdon now aspired to be the head of the Church as the\r\nsuccessor to the martyred prophet.  His claims were verified by\r\na pretended revelation direct from heaven.  He was, however, at\r\nonce antagonized by the \"quorum of the Twelve,\" and after a bitter\r\nstruggle, Apostle Brigham Young was chosen, and Rigdon expelled\r\nfrom the Church and \"given over to the buffetings of Satan.\"\r\n\r\nThe quiet immediately succeeding the tragedy was of short duration.\r\nIt was only the calm which precedes the storm.  While his followers\r\nwere invoking the vengeance of the law upon the murderers of the\r\nprophet, the anti-Mormons were quietly organizing a crusade for\r\nthe expulsion of the entire Mormon population from the State.  The\r\ntrial of the assassins of the Smiths resulted in their acquittal, as\r\nwas to have been expected when the intense anti-Mormon feeling\r\nexisting throughout the immediate country is taken into account.\r\nThe result is even less surprising when it is remembered that\r\nthe principal witness for the prosecution supplemented his testimony\r\nof having seen the crime committed, by the remarkable declaration that\r\nimmediately upon the death of Joseph, \"a bright and shining\r\nlight descended upon his head, that several of the conspirators\r\nwere stricken with total blindness, and that he heard supernatural\r\nvoices in the air confirming the divine mission of the murdered\r\nprophet.\"\r\n\r\nIn the narration of these exciting events, the names of men who at\r\na later day achieved national distinction frequently occur.  The\r\nHon. O. H. Browning, since Senator and member of the Cabinet,\r\nwas chief counsel for the alleged murderers of the Smiths.  He was\r\nat the time a distinguished Whig leader, and one of the most eloquent\r\nmen in the State.  The disorder and outrages that followed the\r\nacquittal just mentioned called Governor Ford again to the seat of\r\nwar.  He says:\r\n\r\n\"When informed of these proceedings, I hastened to Jacksonville,\r\nwhere in a conference with General Hardin, Judge Douglas, and\r\nMr. McDougal the Attorney-General of the State, it was agreed that\r\nthese gentlemen should proceed to Hancock County in all haste with\r\nwhatever force had been raised, and put an end to these disorders.\r\nIt was also agreed that they should unite their influence with mine\r\nto induce the Mormons to leave the State.  The twelve apostles had\r\nnow become satisfied that the Mormons could not remain, or, if they\r\ndid, that the leaders would be compelled to abandon the sway\r\nthey exercised over them.  Through the intervention of General\r\nHardin, acting on instructions from me, an agreement was made\r\nbetween the hostile parties for the voluntary removal of the greater\r\npart of the Mormons across the Mississippi in the spring of 1846.\"\r\n\r\nOf the advisors of the Governor in the adjustment mentioned, Douglas\r\nand McDougall were at a later day distinguished Senators, respectively\r\nfrom Illinois and California, and Hardin was killed while gallantly\r\nleading his regiment at the battle of Buena Vista.\r\n\r\nTo the peaceable accomplishment of the purposes mentioned, a small\r\nforce under a competent officer was stationed for a time in Hancock\r\nCounty.  The Governor justly felicitates himself that thereby \"the\r\ngreater part of the Military Tract was saved from the horrors of\r\ncivil war in the winter time, when much misery would have followed\r\nby the dispersion of families and the destruction of property.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mormon exodus from Illinois, once the \"land of promise,\" now\r\nbegan in terrible earnest.  Many farms and homes and large quantities\r\nof personal effects were hastily disposed of at a great sacrifice.\r\nThe speeding was far different from the welcome but a few years\r\nbefore so heartily extended to the incoming \"saints.\"  The \"Holy\r\nCity\" and sacred temple soon to be destroyed were abandoned for\r\nperilous journeyings in the wilderness.  The chapter that\r\nimmediately follows in the history of this people is indeed pathetic.\r\nThe terrible sufferings of the aged and infirm, of helpless women\r\nand children, as the shadows of the long night of winter gathered about\r\nthem on their journey, can never be adequately told.  But, inspired\r\nwith the thought that they were the Israel of God, that Brigham\r\nYoung was their divinely appointed leader, that the pillar of cloud\r\nby day and of fire by night ever went before them on their journeyings,\r\nthey patiently endured all dangers and hardships.\r\n\r\nHigh upon the western slope of the Wasatch hard by the old wagon\r\ntrail which led down into the valley stands a huge rock around\r\nwhose base the Mormon leader assembled his followers just as the\r\nlast rays of a summer sun were falling upon the mountains.  In\r\nstirring words he recalled their persecutions and trials, told them\r\nthat their long pilgrimage, the weary march by day and lonely vigil\r\nby night, were now ended, and their Canaan the great valley\r\nwhich stretched out before them.\r\n\r\nUpon a visit to Salt Lake City nearly a third of a century ago,\r\nI attended service in the great Tabernacle when it was filled to\r\noverflowing, and yet so excellent were its acoustic arrangements\r\nthat every word of the speaker and every note of the organ could\r\nbe heard distinctly.  The surroundings were indeed imposing.  Upon\r\nthe great platform sat the President and his Council, the twelve\r\napostles, the seventy elders, with an innumerable army of bishops,\r\nteachers, deacons, and other functionaries constituting the\r\nlower order of the Mormon hierarchy.  The sermon was delivered\r\nby the famous Orson Pratt, the Saint Paul of the Mormon Church,\r\na venerable patriarch of four score years, and yet, withal, a man of\r\nwonderful power.\r\n\r\nAs our little party passed in front of the speaker's platform to\r\nreach the door, he halted in his discourse, and stated to the\r\naudience that the strangers within their gates were leaving because\r\nof the near departure of their train and not because of any disrespect\r\nto the service.  Then, bowing his aged head, he invoked the blessing\r\nof the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, upon the Gentile\r\nstrangers, and prayed \"that their long journey might be ended in\r\nsafety, and that in the fulness of time, having witnessed the\r\nmanifestations of Almighty Power, they might return again, not\r\nas sojourners, but as fellow-citizens with the saints, to dwell in\r\nthe Holy City.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\nA KENTUCKY COLONEL\r\n\r\nCOL. WINTERSMITH'S GREAT POPULARITY--HIS ADMIRATION FOR MR. CLAY\r\n--HIS MARVELLOUS MEMORY--HIS WIT AND HUMOR.\r\n\r\nFew men were better known in Washington, a quarter of a century\r\nand more ago, than Colonel Dick Wintersmith of Kentucky.  He had\r\ncreditably filled important positions of public trust in his native\r\nState.  His integrity was beyond question, and his popularity knew\r\nno bounds.  Without the formality of party nomination, and with\r\nhardly the shadow of opposition at the polls, he had held the office\r\nof State Treasurer for nearly a score of years.  An ardent Whig in\r\nearly life, he was a devout worshipper at the shrine of Henry Clay.\r\nIn the later years of his life, he would often with the deepest\r\nemotion refer to himself as \"the last of the old guard.\"  He never\r\ntired of relating interesting incidents of Mr. Clay.  It was his\r\nglory that he had accompanied \"the great pacificator\" to Washington,\r\nwhen, with the fond hope of being able by his historic \"compromise\"\r\nto pour oil on the troubled waters, he returned to the Senate\r\nfor the last time.\r\n\r\nWintersmith was the close friend of Theodore O'Hara, and stood\r\nbeside him when at the unveiling of the monument to the Kentuckians\r\nwho had fallen at Buena Vista he pronounced his now historic lines\r\nbeginning--\r\n\r\n  \"On fame's eternal camping-ground\r\n  Their silent tents are spread.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Wintersmith knew, as he knew his children, two generations\r\nof the public men of Kentucky.  His memory was a marvel to all who\r\nknew him.  He could repeat till the dawn, extracts from famous\r\nspeeches he had heard from the lips of Clay, Grundy, Marshall, and\r\nMenifee.  More than once, I have heard him declaim the wonderful\r\nspeech of Sargent S. Prentiss delivered almost a half-century\r\nbefore, in the old Harrodsburg Court-house, in defence of Wilkinson\r\nfor killing three men at the Galt House.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the Colonel was the soul of\r\ngenerosity.  It was a part of his living faith that--\r\n\r\n  \"Kind hearts are more than coronets.\"\r\n\r\nThat he was possessed in no stinted measure of wit and its kindred\r\nquality, humor, will appear from an incident or two to be related.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Ignatius Donnelly, member of Congress from Minnesota, had\r\nwritten a book to prove that Lord Bacon was the veritable author\r\nof the plays usually accredited to Shakespeare.  Soon after the\r\nappearance of Donnelly's book, he met Colonel Wintersmith on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue.\r\n\r\nAfter a cordial greeting, the Colonel remarked, \"I have been reading\r\nyour book, Donnelly, and I don't believe a word of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" inquired Donnelly, with great surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that book of yours,\" said the Colonel, \"in which you tried to\r\nprove that Shakespeare never wrote 'Hamlet' and 'Macbeth' and 'Lear'\r\nand all those other plays.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" replied Donnelly with great earnestness, \"I can\r\nprove beyond all peradventure that Shakespeare never wrote those\r\nplays.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did,\" replied Wintersmith, \"he did write them, Donnelly, _I\r\nsaw him write three or four of them, myself.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" replied Donnelly, who was as guiltless of anything\r\nthat savored of humor as the monument recently erected to the memory\r\nof Hon. John Sherman, \"impossible, Colonel, that you could have\r\nseen Shakespeare write those plays; they were written three hundred\r\nyears ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred years, three hundred years,\" slowly murmured the\r\nColonel in pathetic tone, \"is it possible that is has been so long?\r\n_Lord, how time does fly!\"_\r\n\r\nThe Colonel often told the following with a gravity that gave it\r\nat least the semblance of truth.  Many years ago, his State was\r\nrepresented in part in the Upper House by a statesman who rarely, when\r\nin good form, spoke less than an entire day.  His speeches, in\r\nlarge measure, usually consisted of dull financial details,\r\nstatistics, etc.  He became in time the terror of his associates, and\r\nthe nightmare of visitors in the galleries.  His \"Mr. President,\" was\r\nusually the signal for a general clearing out of both Senate Chamber\r\nand galleries.\r\n\r\n\"Upon one occasion,\" said Colonel Dick, \"I was seated in the\r\nlast tier in the public gallery, when my Senator with books and\r\ndocuments piled high about him solemnly addressed the Chair.  As\r\nwas the wont, the visitors in the gallery as one man arose to make\r\ntheir exit.  With a revolver in each hand, I promptly planted myself\r\nin front of the door, and in no uncertain tone ordered the crowd to\r\nresume their seats, and remain quietly until the Senator from\r\nKentucky had concluded his remarks.  They did so and no word of\r\ncomplaint reached my ears.  Hour after hour during the long summer\r\nday the speech drew itself along.  At length as the shadows were\r\nlengthening and the crickets began to chirp, the speech ended\r\nand the Senator took his seat.  I promptly replaced my pistols and\r\nmotioned the visitors to move out.  They did so on excellent time.\r\nAs the last man was passing out, he quietly remarked to me, 'Mister,\r\nthat was all right, no fault to find, but _if it was to do over\r\nagain, you might shoot.'\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\nFORGOTTEN EVENTS OF THE LONG AGO\r\n\r\nTHE WRITER MEETS MISS GRAHAM, SISTER-IN-LAW OF MR. GILES, A\r\nREPRESENTATIVE IN THE DAYS OF WASHINGTON--HIS MEETING WITH THE\r\nDAUGHTER OF THOMAS W. GILMER, SECRETARY OF THE NAVY UNDER PRESIDENT\r\nTYLER--THE SECRETARY KILLED, AND THE PRESIDENT ENDANGERED BY AN\r\nEXPLOSION--SPECULATION AS TO POSSIBLE POLITICAL CHANGES HAD THE\r\nPRESIDENT BEEN KILLED.\r\n\r\nDuring my sojourn in Washington I visited the \"Louise Home,\" one\r\nof the splendid charities of the late W. W. Corcoran.  Two of\r\nthe ladies I there met were Miss Graham and Miss Gilmer.  The turn\r\nof Fortune's wheel had brought each of them from once elegant\r\nVirginia homes to spend the evening of life in the Home which\r\nMr. Corcoran had so kindly and thoughtfully provided.  It was in\r\nvery truth the welcome retreat to representatives of old Southern\r\nfamilies who had known better days.  Here in quiet and something\r\nof elegant leisure, the years sped by, the chief pastime recalling\r\nevents and telling over again and again the social triumphs of the\r\nlong ago.  Thus lingering in the shadows of the past, sadly\r\nreflecting, it may be, in the silent watches, that--\r\n\r\n  \"The tender grace of a day that is dead\r\n  Will never come back to me,\"\r\n\r\nthese venerable ladies were in sad reality \"only waiting till the\r\nshadows had a little longer grown.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something pathetically remindful of the good old Virginia\r\ndays in the manner in which Miss Graham handed me her card and\r\ninvited me to be seated.  Looking me earnestly in the face, she\r\nsaid, \"Mr. Vice-President, you must have known my brother-in-law, Governor\r\nGiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean Senator William B. Giles of Virginia?\"  I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" she said, \"did you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madam,\" I replied, \"I did not; he was a member of Congress\r\nwhen Washington was President; that was a little before my day.\r\nBut is it possible that you are a sister-in-law of Governor Giles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" she answered, \"he married my eldest sister and I was\r\nin hope that you knew him.\"\r\n\r\nI assured her that I had never known him personally, but that I\r\nknew something of his history:  that he was a soldier of the\r\nRevolution; that he began his public career with the passing of\r\nthe old Confederation and the establishment of the National Union;\r\nthat as Representative or Senator he was in Congress almost\r\ncontinuously from the administration of Washington to that of\r\nJackson.  I then repeated to her the words Mr. Benton, his long-time\r\nassociate in the Senate, had spoken of her brother-in-law:  \"Macon\r\nwas wise, Randolph brilliant, Gallatin and Madison able in argument,\r\nbut Giles was the ready champion, always ripe for the combat.\"  And\r\nI told her that John Randolph, for many years his colleague, had\r\nsaid:  \"Giles was to our House of Representatives what Charles\r\nJames Fox was to the British House of Commons--the most accomplished\r\ndebater our country has known.\"\r\n\r\nI might have said to Miss Graham, but did not, that her brother-in-law,\r\nthen a member of the House, had voted against the farewell address\r\nof that body to President Washington upon his retirement from\r\nthe great office.  Strange indeed to our ears sound the words that\r\neven mildly reflect upon the Father of his Country.  Of this,\r\nhowever, we may be assured, that the Golden Age of our history\r\nis but a dream; \"the era of absolute good feeling,\"--the era that has\r\nnot been.\r\n\r\n  \"Past and to come seem best;\r\n  Things present, worst.\"\r\n\r\nBefore condemning Mr. Giles too severely the words of Edmund Burke\r\nmay well be recalled:  \"Party divisions, whether upon the whole\r\noperating for the best, are things inseparable from free Government.\"\r\nParty divisions came in with our Constitution; partisan feeling\r\nalmost with our first garments.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it will be remembered that this country has\r\nknown no period of more intense and bitter party feeling than during\r\nthe administration of the immediate successor of Washington, the\r\nperiod which witnessed the downfall of the Federal party, and\r\nthe rise of the party of Jefferson.  It was after the election but\r\nbefore the inauguration of John Adams, that the following words\r\nwere spoken of President Washington by the brother-in-law of the\r\nlittle old lady to whom I have referred:\r\n\r\n\"I must object to those parts of the address which speak of the\r\nwisdom and firmness of the President.  I may be singular in my\r\nideas, but I believe his administration has neither been firm\r\nnor wise.  I must acknowledge that I am one of those who do not\r\nthink so much of the President as some others do.  I wish that this\r\nwas the moment of his retirement.  I think that the Government\r\nof the United States can go on without him.  What calamities would\r\nattend the United States, and how short the duration of its\r\nindependence, if but one man could be found fitted to conduct\r\nits administration!  Much had been said and by many people about\r\nthe President's intended retirement.  For my own part, I feel no\r\nuncomfortable sensations about it.\"\r\n\r\nAs I thus recalled the man whose public life began with that of\r\nWashington, his kinswoman at my side seemed indeed the one living bond\r\nof connection between the present and the long past, that past\r\nwhich had witnessed the Declaration of Independence, the War of\r\nthe Revolution, and the establishment of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThe younger, by many years, of the two ladies, was the daughter of\r\nthe Hon. Thomas W. Gilmer, a distinguished member of Congress during\r\nthe third decade of the century, later the Governor of Virginia,\r\nand at the time of his death the Secretary of the Navy.  The mention\r\nof his name recalls a tragic event that cast a pall over the nation\r\nand shrouded more than one hearthstone in deepest gloom.  During\r\nlater years, the horrors of an internecine struggle that knows no\r\nparallel, the assassination of three Presidents of the United\r\nStates, and the thousand casualties that have crowded in rapid\r\nsuccession, have almost wiped from memory the incident now to be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe pride of the American Navy, the man-of-war _Princeton,_ Commodore\r\nStockton in command, was lying in the Potomac just below Washington,\r\non the morning of February 28, 1843.  The day was beautiful, and the\r\ndistinguished commander, who had known much of gallant service,\r\nhad invited more than one hundred guests to accompany him on a sail\r\nto a point a few miles below Mount Vernon.  Among the guests\r\nwere President Tyler and two members of his Cabinet; Mr. Upshur,\r\nSecretary of State, and Mr. Gilmer, Secretary of the Navy; the\r\nwidow of Ex-President Madison; Mr. Gardner, a prominent citizen of\r\nNew York, and his accomplished daughter; Commodore Kennan; and a\r\nnumber of Senators and Representatives.  Commodore Stockton was\r\nanxious to have his guests witness the working of the machinery of\r\nhis vessel and to observe the fire of his great gun, his especial pride.\r\nMr. Gardner and his daughter were guests at the Executive Mansion;\r\nand to the latter, the President--then for many years a widower\r\n--was especially attentive.  Officers and guests were all in the\r\nbest of sprits, and nothing seemed wanting to make the occasion\r\none of unalloyed pleasure.  Upon the return, and when almost directly\r\nopposite Mount Vernon, the company were summoned by the Commodore from\r\nthe dinner table to witness the testing of the gun.  Preceded by\r\nan officer, the guests were soon assembled in proximity to the gun.\r\nA place at the front was reserved for the President, but just as\r\nhe was advancing, his attention was directed by his fair guest\r\nto some object on the shore.  This for a moment arrested his\r\nprogress, and prevented his instant death, for at this critical\r\nmoment the gun exploded, causing the immediate death of more\r\nthan twenty persons, and serious injuries to many others.  Among\r\nthe injured were Senator Benton and Commodore Stockton.  The list\r\nof the dead included Secretary of State Upshur, Secretary of the\r\nNavy Gilmer, Commodore Kennan--one of the heroes of the second war\r\nwith Great Britain,--and Mr. Gardner, the father of the lady whose\r\ntimely interposition had caused the moment's delay which had saved\r\nthe President from the terrible fate of his associates.  Upon\r\nthe return of the _Princeton_ to Washington the dead were removed to\r\nthe Executive Mansion, and the day, so auspicious in the beginning,\r\nended in gloom.\r\n\r\nSomething in the way of romance is the sequel to that sad event.\r\nA few months later Miss Gardner, the fair guest of the President\r\nupon the ill-fated _Princeton,_ became his bride, and during the\r\nremainder of his term of office did the honors of the Executive\r\nMansion.\r\n\r\nThe thousands of visitors who have, during the past sixty years,\r\npassed through the spacious rooms of that Mansion, have paused\r\nbefore a full-length portrait of one of the most beautiful of women.\r\nPossibly the interest of no one who gazed upon her lovely features\r\nwas lessened when told that the portrait was that of the wife of\r\nPresident Tyler, the once charming and accomplished Miss Gardner, whose\r\nname is so closely associated with the long-ago chapter of sorrow and\r\nof romance.\r\n\r\nA thought pertaining to the domain of the real rather than of\r\nthe romantic is suggested by the sad accident upon the _Princeton._\r\nBut for the trifling incident which detained President Tyler from the\r\nside of his Cabinet officers at the awful moment, the administration\r\nof the Government would have passed to other hands.  As the law\r\nthen stood, the Speaker of the House of Representatives would have\r\nsucceeded to the Presidency; and how this might have changed the\r\ncurrent of our political history is a matter of at least curious\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nRemembering that--\r\n\r\n  \"Two stars keep not\r\n  Their motion in one sphere,\"\r\n\r\nmight not the removal of one have healed the widening breach in\r\nthe Whig party?  What might have been its effect upon the grand\r\nInternal Improvement Scheme--the darling project of Henry Clay?\r\nwhat upon the determination of the Oregon Boundary Question--whether\r\nby diplomacy or war? and how might the destiny of the \"Lone Star,\"\r\nthe Republic of Texas, have been changed?  What might have been\r\nthe effect upon the political fortunes of Tyler's great antagonist,\r\naround whom the aggressive forces of the party he had founded were\r\neven then gathering for a life-and-death struggle against a\r\ncomparatively obscure rival in the Presidential campaign of 1844?\r\n\r\nTrifles light as air are sometimes the pivots upon which hinge\r\nmomentous events.  The ill-timed publication of a personal\r\nletter defeated Cass in 1848; and within our day the utterance of a\r\nsingle word, unheard by the candidate to whom it was addressed,\r\nlost the Presidency to Blaine.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism of Tyler and his adherents eliminated, it is within\r\nthe bounds of probability that Henry Clay would have triumphed\r\nin his last struggle for the Presidency.  If so, what change might\r\nnot have been wrought in the trend of history?  Under the splendid\r\nleadership of the \"great pacificator,\" what might have been the\r\ntermination of vital questions even then casting their dark shadows\r\nupon our national pathway?\r\n\r\nWith Clay at the helm, himself the incarnation of the spirit of\r\ncompromise, possibly--who can tell?--the evil days so soon to follow\r\nmight have been postponed for many generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\nROBERT G. INGERSOLL\r\n\r\nMR. INGERSOLL'S ELOQUENCE WHILE A YOUNG MAN--HIS CANDIDACY FOR\r\nCONGRESS--HIS AGNOSTICISM A HINDRANCE TO HIS POLITICAL ADVANCEMENT\r\n--HIS ORATION AT THE FUNERAL OF HIS BROTHER.\r\n\r\nIt was in April, 1859, that for the first time I met Robert G.\r\nIngersoll.  He came over from his home in Peoria to attend the\r\nWoodford Circuit Court.  He was then under thirty years of age, of\r\nsplendid physique, magnetic in the fullest significance of the\r\nword, and one of the most attractive and agreeable of men.  He was\r\nalmost boyish in appearance, and hardly known beyond the limits of\r\nthe county in which he lived.  He had but recently moved to Peoria\r\nfrom the southern part of the State.\r\n\r\nTo those who remember him it is hardly necessary to say that even at\r\nthat early day he gave unmistakable evidence of his marvellous\r\ngifts.  His power over a jury was wonderful indeed; and woe betide\r\nthe counsel of but mediocre talents who had Ingersoll for an\r\nantagonist in a closely contested case.\r\n\r\nThe old Court-house at Metamora is yet standing, a monument of the\r\npast; the county seat removed, it has long since fallen from its\r\nhigh estate.  In my boyhood, I have more than once heard Mr. Lincoln\r\nat its bar, and later was a practitioner there myself--and State's\r\nAttorney for the Circuit,--when Mr. Ingersoll was attendant upon\r\nits courts.  Rarely at any time or place have words been spoken\r\nmore eloquent than fell from the lips of Lincoln and Ingersoll\r\nin that now deserted Court-house, in the years long gone by.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of Mr. Ingersoll in the political arena was\r\nin the Presidential struggle of 1860.  In his later years he was\r\na Republican, but in the contest just mentioned he was the earnest\r\nadvocate of the election of Mr. Douglas to the Presidency and\r\nwas himself the Democratic candidate for Congress in the Peoria\r\nDistrict.  His competitor was Judge Kellogg, a gentleman of well-known\r\nability and many years' experience in Congress.  Immediately upon his\r\nnomination, Ingersoll challenged Kellogg to a series of joint\r\ndebates.  The challenge was accepted, and the debates which followed\r\nwere a rare treat to the throngs who heard them.  The discussion\r\nturned upon the vital issues yet pending at the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War, issues which were to find their final determination\r\non the field of battle.  Possibly, with the exception of the historic\r\ndebates two years earlier, between Lincoln and Douglas, the country\r\nhas known no abler discussion of great questions.  It was then for\r\nthe first time that Ingersoll displayed the marvellous forensic\r\npowers that at a later day--and upon a different arena--gave him\r\nworld-wide renown.\r\n\r\nIt was at a period subsequent to that just mentioned that he became\r\nan agnostic.  I recall no expression of his during the early years\r\nof our acquaintance that indicated a departure from the faith in\r\nwhich he had been reared.  That his extreme views upon religious\r\nsubjects, and his manner, exceedingly offensive at times, of\r\nexpressing them, formed an insuperable barrier to his political\r\nadvancement, cannot be doubted.  But for his unbelief, what political\r\nhonors might have awaited him cannot certainly be known.  But\r\nrecalling the questions then under discussion, the intensity of\r\nparty feeling, and the enthusiasm that his marvellous eloquence\r\nnever failed to arouse in the thousands who hung upon his words, it\r\nis probable that the most exalted station might have been attained.\r\nTo those familiar with the political events of that day, it is\r\nknown that the antagonism aroused by his assaults upon the citadel\r\nof the faith sacred to the many, compassed his defeat in his\r\ncandidature in 1868 for the Governorship of Illinois.  His explanation\r\nwas, that his defeat was caused by a slight difference of\r\nopinion between himself and some of the brethren upon the highly\r\nexciting question of total depravity.\r\n\r\nSome years later, the nominee of his party for the Presidency\r\nwas exceedingly obnoxious to him.  Meeting the Colonel the morning\r\nafter the adjournment of the convention I inquired, \"Are you happy?\"\r\nTo this he replied, that he was somewhat in the condition of a very\r\nprofane youth who had just got religion at a backwoods camp-meeting.\r\nSoon after his conversion, the preacher, taking him affectionately by\r\nthe hand, inquired:  \"My young friend, are you very happy?\"  \"Well,\r\nparson,\" replied the only half-converted youth, \"I am not damn happy,\r\njust _happy,_ that's all.\"\r\n\r\nHis only brother was for many years a Representative in Congress\r\nfrom Illinois.  Clark Ingersoll was himself able and eloquent, but\r\novershadowed by the superior gifts of his younger brother, the\r\nsubject of this sketch.  The death of the former was to Colonel\r\nIngersoll a sorrow which remained with him to the last.  The funeral\r\noccurred in Washington in the summer of 1879, and of the pall-bearers\r\nselected by Colonel Ingersoll for the last sad service to his\r\nbrother, were men well known in public life, one of whom but two\r\nyears later, while President of the United States, fell by the hand\r\nof an assassin.\r\n\r\nFrom a Washington paper of the day succeeding the funeral of Clark\r\nIngersoll, the following is taken:  \"When Colonel Ingersoll ceased\r\nspeaking the pall-bearers, Senator Allison, Senator David Davis,\r\nSenator Blaine, Senator Voorhees, Representatives Garfield of Ohio,\r\nMorrison, Boyd, and Stevenson of Illinois, bore the casket to\r\nthe hearse and the lengthy _cortege_ proceeded to the Oak Hill\r\nCemetery where the remains were interred.\"\r\n\r\nThe occasion was one that will not easily pass from my memory.\r\nThere was no service whatever save the funeral oration which has\r\nfound its way into all languages.  I stood by the side of\r\nColonel Ingersoll near the casket during its delivery, and vividly\r\nrecall his deep emotion, and the faltering tones in which the\r\nwondrous sentences were uttered.  It is probable that this oration\r\nhas no counterpart in literature.  It seemed in very truth the\r\nknell of hope, the expression of a grief that could know no surcease,\r\nthe agony of a parting that could know no morrow.\r\n\r\nIn such an hour how cheerless and comfortless these words:\r\n\r\n\"Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two\r\neternities.  We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.  We cry\r\naloud, and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.\r\n\r\n\"Every life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love, and\r\nevery moment jewelled with a joy, will at its close become a tragedy\r\nas sad and deep and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of\r\nmystery and death.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet in those other words, \"But in the night of death, hope sees\r\na star, and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing,\" and,\r\n\"while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of a grander\r\nday,\" there is a yearning for \"the touch of a vanished hand,\" and a\r\nhope that no philosophy could dispel of a reunion sometime and\r\nsomewhere with the loved and lost.\r\n\r\nTwo decades later, again \"the veiled shadow stole upon the scene,\"\r\nand the sublime mystery of life and death was revealed.  The awful\r\nquestion, \"If a man die shall he live again?\" was answered, and to\r\nthe great agnostic _all was known._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\nA CAMP-MEETING ORATOR\r\n\r\nPETER CARTWRIGHT, METHODIST PREACHER--HIS FEARLESSNESS AND ENERGY--\r\nHIS OLD-FASHIONED ORTHODOXY--HOW HE CONVERTED A PROFANE SWEARER\r\n--HIS ATTENDANCE AT A BALL--OLD-TIME CAMP-MEETINGS--CARTWRIGHT'S\r\nAVERSION TO OTHER SECTS--CONVERSION OF A DESPERADO INTO A PENITENT\r\n--CARTWRIGHT MR. LINCOLN'S COMPETITOR FOR REPRESENTATIVE--HIS SPEECH\r\nAT A DEMOCRATIC STATE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Peter Cartwright was a noted Methodist preacher of pioneer\r\ndays in Central Illinois.  Once seen, he was a man never to be\r\nforgotten.  He was, in the most expressive sense of the words, _sui\r\ngeneris;_ a veritable product of the times in which he lived,\r\nand the conditions under which he moved and had his being.  All in\r\nall, his like will not appear again.  He was converted when a mere\r\nyouth at a camp-meeting in southern Kentucky; soon after, he was\r\nlicensed to preach, and became a circuit rider in that State,\r\nand later was of the Methodist vanguard to Illinois.  It was said of\r\nhim that he was of the church _military_ as well as \"the church\r\nmilitant.\"  He was of massive build, an utter stranger to fear,\r\nand of unquestioned honesty and sincerity.  He was gifted with\r\nan eloquence adapted to the times in which he lived, and the\r\ncongregations to which he preached.  There would be no place for\r\nhim now, for the untutored assemblages who listened with bated\r\nbreath to his fiery appeals are of the past.\r\n\r\n  \"For, welladay!  Their day is fled,\r\n  Old times are changed, old manners gone.\"\r\n\r\nThe narrative of his tough conflicts with the emissaries of Satan is\r\neven now of the rarest reading for a summer's day or a winter's\r\nnight.  How he fought the Indians, fought the robbers, swam rivers,\r\nand threaded the prairies, in order that he might carry the Gospel\r\nto the remotest frontiersmen, was of thrilling interest to many of\r\nthe new generation as his own sands were running low.  He literally\r\ntook no thought of the morrow, but without staff and little even\r\nin the way of scrip unselfishly gave the best years of a life\r\nextending two decades beyond the time allotted, to the service\r\nof his Master.\r\n\r\nUntil the Judgment leaves are unfolded the good which this man and\r\nmany of his co-laborers did in the new country will never be known.\r\nA journey of days on horseback to fill an appointment, to perform a\r\nmarriage ceremony, preach a funeral sermon, or speak words of hope\r\nand comfort to the sick or the bereaved, was part of the sum of\r\na life of service that knew little of rest.\r\n\r\nThere would probably be few pulpits open to Peter Cartwright in\r\nthese more cultivated times.  Old things have passed away; the\r\npioneer in his rough garb, with axe upon his shoulder, and rifle\r\nin hand, is now but a tradition, while the border line of civilization\r\nhas receded westward to the ocean.\r\n\r\nNone the less, the typical minister of to-day would have had\r\nvery scant welcome in the rude pulpits of the days of which we\r\nwrite.  His elegant attire, conventional manners, written sermons,\r\nand new theology, would have been sadly out of place in the\r\ncamp-meeting times, for be it remembered that Cartwright called\r\nthings by their right names.  He gave forth no uncertain sound.\r\nHis theology was that of the Fathers.  We hear little in these\r\nmodern days of \"The fire that quencheth not\" and of \"total depravity\"\r\nand of \"the bottomless pit.\"  Such expressions are unfitted for ears\r\npolite.  Higher criticism, new thought, and all kindred ideas\r\nand suggestions,\r\n\r\n  \"Sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer,\"\r\n\r\nwere believed by Cartwright and his contemporaries to be mere\r\ncontrivances of Satan for the ensnaring of immortal souls.  His\r\nabhorrence of all these \"wiles of the devil,\" and his scorn for\r\ntheir advocates, knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nHis preaching was of the John Wesley, George Whitefield, and Jonathan\r\nEdwards type.  Mingled with his denunciations of sin, his\r\nearnest exhortations to repentance, his graphic description of the\r\nNew Jerusalem, with its \"streets of gold, walls of jasper, and\r\ngates of pearl,\" and of the unending bliss of the redeemed, were\r\nexpressions now relegated to the limbo of the past.  Little\r\ntime, however, was wasted by the Rev. Peter in picking out soft\r\nwords for fear of giving offence.  To his impassioned soul \"the\r\nfinal doom of the impenitent,\" the \"torment of the damned,\" and\r\n\"hell fire\" itself, were veritable realities.  And so indeed, when\r\nrolling from his tongue, did they appear, not alone to the rapt\r\nbeliever, but oftentimes to the ungodly and the sinner as well.\r\n\r\nMore than one marvellous conversion under his ministration is\r\nrecorded by Brother Cartwright in the autobiography written in the\r\nclosing years of his life.  At one time in crossing a stream, he\r\nwas deeply offended by the profanity of the boatman.  The kindly\r\nadmonition and the gentle rebuke of the minister apparently added zest\r\nand volume to the oaths of the boatman.  Suddenly seizing the\r\noffender, the irate preacher ducked him into the river, and turned\r\na deaf ear to his piteous appeals for succor until the half-drowned\r\nwretch had offered a prayer for mercy and made profuse promises of\r\nrepentance.  Hopeful conversion, and an ever-after life of Christian\r\nhumility, were the gratifying sequels to the baptism so unexpectedly\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nAnother experience no less remarkable occurred when, during the\r\nearly years of his ministry, he was crossing the mountains on\r\nhis way to the General Conference.  At a tavern by the wayside,\r\nwhere he had obtained lodging for the night, he found preparations\r\nin progress for a ball to come off that very evening.  The protestation\r\nof the minister against such wickedness only aroused the ire of\r\nthe landlord and his family.  The dance promptly began at the\r\nappointed time.\r\n\r\n  \"Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,\r\n  And all went merry as a marriage-bell.\"\r\n\r\nThere being but a single room to the house, and a storm raging\r\nwithout, the outraged and indignant minister was the unwilling\r\nwitness to the ebb and flow of this tide of ungodliness.  At length,\r\nas partners were being chosen for the Virginia Reel, a beautiful\r\ngirl approached the solitary guest and requested his hand for\r\nthe set just forming.  The minister arose and intimated a ready\r\ncompliance with her request, at the same time assuring her that he\r\nnever entered upon any important undertaking without first invoking\r\nGod's blessing upon it; and seizing her by the hand he fell upon\r\nhis knees and with the voice of one born to be obeyed commanded\r\nsilence and began his prayer.  The dance was immediately suspended,\r\nand a solemnity and horror, as if the presage of approaching doom,\r\nfell upon the startled assemblage.  Above the agonizing sobs of\r\nthe lately impenitent revellers was heard, as was that of the\r\nancient prophet above the din of the worshippers of Baal, the voice\r\nof the man of God in earnest appeals to the throne of grace for\r\nmercy to these \"hell-deserving sinners.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour passed; lamentation and groans of sin-sick soul mingled\r\nmeanwhile with the fervent exhortations and appeals of the man\r\nof prayer.  Suddenly and in rapid succession shout after shout\r\nof victory from redeemed souls ascended, and as if by magic the\r\nlate abode of scoffers became indeed a very Bethel.  The incidents\r\nmentioned, and others scarcely less remarkable, will be found in Mr.\r\nCartwright's autobiography.  The present generation knows but little\r\nof the old-time camp-meeting; as it existed in the days and under the\r\nadministration of Peter Cartwright and his co-laborers, it is verily\r\na thing of the past.\r\n\r\n  \"New occasions teach new duties;\r\n  Time makes ancient good uncouth.\"\r\n\r\nSeventy years and more ago, the country new, the population sparse,\r\nthe settlements few and far between, the camp-meeting was of yearly\r\nand, as it was believed, of necessary occurrence.  It was, especially\r\nwith the early Methodists, a recognized instrumentality for preaching\r\nthe Gospel for the conversion of souls.\r\n\r\nA convenient spot--usually near a spring or brook--being selected,\r\na rude pulpit was erected, rough seats provided, a log cabin or\r\ntwo for the aged and infirm hastily constructed, and there in\r\nthe early autumn large congregations assembled for worship.  For\r\nmany miles around, and often from neighboring counties, the people\r\ncame, on horseback, in wagons, and on foot.  Each family furnished\r\nits own tent, the needed bed-clothing, cooking utensils, and abundant\r\nprovisions for their temporary sojourn in the wilderness.  It was no\r\nholiday occasion, no time for merry making.  It was often at\r\nmuch sacrifice and discomfort that such meetings were held, and\r\npreachers and people alike were in terrible earnest.  Rigid rules for\r\ntheir government were formulated and enforced, and a proper decorum\r\nrequired and observed.  Woe betide the wretch who attempted to\r\ncreate disturbance, or depart from the strictest propriety of\r\ndeportment.  Not infrequently in the early camp-meetings of Kentucky\r\nand Tennessee there were stalwart men keeping guard over these\r\nreligious gatherings, who had in their younger days hunted the\r\nsavage foe from his fastness, faced Tecumseh at Tippecanoe and the\r\nThames, possibly been comrades of \"Old Hickory\" through the Everglades\r\nand at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nA sufficient time being set apart for meals and the needed hours\r\nof rest, the residue was in the main devoted to public or\r\nprivate worship.  Family prayer-meetings were held in each tent at\r\nthe early dawn; public preaching by the most gifted speakers during\r\ntwo hours or more of the forenoon.  After a hasty midday meal\r\nthe public services were resumed, to be followed at the appointed time\r\nby meetings for special prayer, class meetings, and love feasts,\r\nall conducted with the greatest possible solemnity; and the exercises,\r\nafter supper had been served and the candles lighted, concluded\r\nfor the day with an impassioned sermon from the main stand.  During\r\nthe last-mentioned service especially, the scene presented was\r\ntruly of a weird and picturesque character.  The flickering lights\r\nof the camp, the dark forest around, the melodious concert of a\r\nthousand voices mingling in sacred song, the awe-inspiring,\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten hymn,\r\n\r\n  \"Come, humble sinner, in whose breast\r\n  A thousand thoughts revolve,\"\r\n\r\nthe fervid exclamations as convicted sinners gathered around the\r\nmourners' bench and the shouts of joy heard far beyond the limits of\r\nthe camp as peace found lodging in sin-distracted souls, all\r\nimpressed the memory and heart too deeply for even the flight of\r\nyears wholly to dispel.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be added that these scenes, of which but feeble\r\ndescription has been given, marked the hour of triumph of the truly\r\ngifted of the revival preachers of camp-meeting times.  The echoes\r\nwill never awake to the sound of such eloquence again.  The orator\r\nand the occasion here met and embraced.  In very truth, the joys\r\nof the redeemed, and the horrors of lost souls, were depicted in\r\ncolors that only lips \"touched with a live coal from the altar\"\r\ncould adequately describe.  In the presence of such lurid imagery,\r\neven the inspired revelation of the apocalyptic vision seems but\r\nsober narrative of commonplace events.\r\n\r\nWith camp-meetings and their thrilling incidents of two generations\r\nago in our Western country, the name of Peter Cartwright is\r\ninseparably associated.  He was the born leader; _par excellence,_\r\nthe unrivalled orator.  Since the passing of Whitefield and Asbury\r\na greater than he had not appeared.  To those who have never attended\r\nan old-time camp-meeting the following quotation from Mr.\r\nCartwright's autobiography may be of interest:\r\n\r\n\"The meeting was protracted for weeks and was kept up day and night.\r\nThousands heard of the mighty work, and came on foot, on horseback,\r\nand in wagons.  It was supposed that there were in attendance at\r\ndifferent times from twelve to twenty-five thousand.  Hundreds fell\r\nprostrate under the mighty power of God, as men slain in battle;\r\nand it was supposed that between one and two thousand souls were\r\nhappily and powerfully converted to God during the meetings.  It\r\nwas not unusual for as many as seven preachers to be addressing\r\nthe listening thousands at a time, from different stands.  At times,\r\nmore than a thousand persons broke out into loud shouting, all at\r\nonce, and the shouts could be heard for miles around.\"\r\n\r\nStrange as the following may sound to the present generation, it\r\nis one of the many experiences recorded by Cartwright:\r\n\r\n\"The camp-meeting was lighted up, the trumpet blown, I rose in the\r\nstand and required every soul to leave the tents and come into the\r\ncongregation.  There was a general rush to the stand.  I requested\r\nthe brethren, if ever they prayed in their lives, to pray now.  My\r\nvoice was strong and clear, and my preaching was more of an\r\nexhortation than anything else.  My text was:  'The gates of\r\nhell shall not prevail.'  In about thirty minutes the power of God\r\nfell upon the congregation in such a manner as is seldom seen; the\r\npeople fell in every direction, right and left, front and rear.\r\nIt was supposed that not less than three hundred fell like dead\r\nmen in mighty battle; and there was no need of calling mourners,\r\nfor they were strewed all over the camp ground.  Loud wailings went\r\nup to Heaven from sinners for mercy, and a general shout from\r\nChristians so that the noise was hear afar off.\"\r\n\r\nThat it was by no means an unusual occurrence for those who came\r\nto scoff to remain to pray will appear from the same book:\r\n\r\n\"Just as I was closing up my sermon and pressing it with all the\r\nforce I could command, the power of God suddenly was displayed,\r\nand sinners fell by scores all through the assembly.  It was supposed\r\nthat several hundred fell in five minutes; sinners turned pale;\r\nsome ran into the woods; some tried to get away, and fell in the\r\nattempt; some shouted aloud for joy.\"\r\n\r\nThe horror of Brother Cartwrights for \"immersionists\" and Calvinists\r\nof every degree, appears throughout his entire book.  That his\r\nrighteous soul was often sorely vexed because of them is beyond\r\nquestion.  That his cup had not been drained to the dregs will\r\nappear from a new element he encountered when sent across the Ohio\r\nto the Scioto conference.\r\n\r\n\"It was a poor and hard circuit at that time, and the country round\r\nwas settled in an early day by a colony of Yankees.  At the time\r\nof my appointment I had never seen a Yankee, and I had heard dismal\r\nstories about them.  It was said they lived almost entirely on\r\npumpkins, molasses, fat meat, and Bohea tea; moreover that they\r\ncould not bear loud and zealous sermons, and that they had brought\r\non their learned preachers with them, and were always criticising us\r\npoor backwoods preachers.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"isms\" our circuit-rider now encountered would have appalled\r\na less resolute man.  He seems, however, to have gotten along fairly\r\nwell except with one \"female,\" who, from all accounts, was given\r\nover in about equal parts to \"universalism\" and \"predestinarianism.\"\r\nThis troublesome female, that he candidly admitted he had _a\r\nhard race to keep up with,_ he has left impaled for all time as\r\na \"thin-faced, Roman-nosed, loquacious, glib-tongued Yankee.\"\r\n\r\nSomething of the antagonism of the different persuasions in the\r\ngood old pioneer days, may be gathered from the tender farewell\r\ntaken by Brother Cartwright of a former associate, one Brother D.,\r\n\"who left the Methodists, joined the Free-will Baptists, left them\r\nand joined the New Lights, and then moved to Texas, where I expect\r\nthe devil has him in safe keeping long before this time!\"\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to suppose that Peter Cartwright was a mere\r\nvisionary or dreamer.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.\r\nHe was abundantly possessed with what, in Western parlance, is\r\nknown as \"horse sense.\"  He was a student of men, and kept in close\r\ntouch with the affairs of this world.  His shrewdness, no less than\r\nhis courage, was a proverb in his day.  Upon one occasion, at\r\nthe beginning of his sermon before a large audience, he was more\r\nthan once interrupted by the persistent but ineffectual attempt of\r\na saintly old sister to shout.  Annoyed at length, turning to her he\r\nsaid:  \"Dear sister, never shout as a matter of duty; when you\r\ncan't help it, then shout; _but never shout as a mere matter of\r\nduty!\"_\r\n\r\nAt a camp-meeting on the banks of the Cumberland in the early years\r\nof the last century, an attempt was made by a band of desperadoes to\r\ncreate a disturbance.  To this end their leader, a burly ruffian, stalked\r\nto the front of the pulpit, and with an oath commanded Cartwright to\r\n\"dry up.\"  Suspending divine service for a few minutes, and laying\r\naside his coat, the preacher descended from the pulpit and springing\r\nupon the intruder, felled him to the earth and belabored him until\r\nthe wretch begged for mercy.  The precious boon was withheld until\r\nthe now penitent disturber, after promising to repent, had been\r\ngiven the humblest seat in the \"amen corner.\"  This all satisfactorily\r\ncompleted, and his garment replaced, the minister, scarcely ruffled\r\nby the trifling incident, re-entered the pulpit, and with the words,\r\n\"As I was saying, brethren, when interrupted,\" continued his\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\nThis little sketch would be unpardonably incomplete if the important\r\nfact were withheld that Peter Cartwright had a relish for politics,\r\nas well as for salvation.  He was more than once a member of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of Illinois, and be it said to his eternal honor his\r\nspeech and vote were ever on the side of whatever conduced to\r\nthe best interests of the State.  In him the cause of education,\r\nand the asylums for the unfortunate, had ever an earnest advocate.\r\n\r\nThough many years his senior, he was the contemporary of Abraham\r\nLincoln, and a resident of the same county.  Mr. Lincoln was, in\r\n1846, the Whig candidate for Representative in Congress.  The\r\ndistrict was of immense area, embracing many counties of Central\r\nIllinois.  Newspapers were scarce, and the old-time custom of joint\r\ndiscussions between opposing candidates for high office were still\r\nin vogue.  Mr. Lincoln's unsuccessful competitor was none other\r\nthan the subject of this article.  The great Whig leader and his\r\nDemocratic antagonist--\"My friend the Parson,\" as Mr. Lincoln\r\nfamiliarly called him--were soon engaged in joint debate.  It is\r\nto be regretted that there is no record of these debates.  There\r\nis probably no man now living who heard them.  But what rare reading\r\nthey would be at this day, if happily they had been preserved.\r\nThe earnest, inflexible parson,--even then \"standing upon the\r\nWestern slope,\"--backed by his party, then dominant in the national\r\ngovernment, upon the one side; the comparatively youthful lawyer, whose\r\nfame was yet to fill the world, upon the other.  No doubt, daily\r\nupon \"the stump\" and at night at the village taverns, the changes\r\nwere rung upon the then all-absorbing subjects, the Walker Tariff,\r\nthe War with Mexico, and the Wilmot Proviso.  These questions belong\r\nnow to the domain of history; as do indeed issues of far greater\r\nconsequence, upon which Lincoln and an antagonist more formidable than\r\nCartwright crossed swords a dozen years later.\r\n\r\nAt the Democratic State Convention, which assembled in Springfield\r\nin the early spring of 1860, a resolution instructing the Illinois\r\ndelegates to support Stephen A. Douglas for nomination to the\r\nPresidency at the approaching National Convention was adopted amidst\r\ngreat enthusiasm.  Immediately upon its adoption, a delegate called\r\nattention to the fact that the venerable Peter Cartwright was\r\npresent, and said he knew the Convention would be glad to hear a\r\nword from him.  Immediately \"Cartwright,\" \"Cartwright,\" \"Cartwright,\"\r\nwas heard from all parts of the chamber.  From his seat, surrounded\r\nby the Sangamon County delegates, near the central part of the\r\nhall, Mr. Cartwright arose, and with deep emotion, and scarcely\r\naudible voice, began:\r\n\r\n\"My friends and fellow-citizens, I am happy to be with you on\r\nthe present occasion.  My sun is low down upon the horizon, and\r\nthe days of my pilgrimage are almost numbered.  I have lived in\r\nIllinois during the entire period of its history as a State.  I\r\nhave watched with tender interest its marvellous growth from its\r\nfeeble condition as a Territory, until it has reached its\r\npresent splendor as a State.  I have travelled over its prairies,\r\nslept with only the canopy of heaven for a covering; I have followed\r\nthe trail of the Indians, fought the desperadoes, swam the rivers,\r\nthreaded the almost pathless forests, in order that I might carry the\r\ntidings of the blessed Gospel to the loneliest cabin upon the\r\nborder.  Yes, my friends, for seventy long years, amid appalling\r\ndifficulties and dangers, I have waged an incessant warfare against\r\nthe world, the flesh, the devil, _and all the other enemies of the\r\nDemocratic party!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\nCLEVELAND AS I KNEW HIM\r\n\r\nCLEVELAND'S SPEECH ACCEPTING HIS NOMINATION--MR. BLAINE'S FRUITLESS\r\nTOUR AS A CANDIDATE--CLEVELAND'S INSIGHT INTO HUMAN CHARACTER--HIS\r\nTARIFF-REDUCTION MESSAGE--WITHDRAWAL OF THE HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION\r\nTREATY--HIS VENEZUELAN MISSION--HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SCIENCE OF\r\nGOVERNMENT--HIS QUALIFICATIONS FOR SOCIAL LIFE AND FOR SERVING THE\r\nCOUNTRY.\r\n\r\nUpon the adjournment of the Democratic National Convention of 1884,\r\nwhich had nominated Mr. Cleveland for the Presidency, in company\r\nwith other delegates I visited him at the Executive Mansion at\r\nAlbany, New York.  The Hon. William F. Vilas was the chairman of\r\nour committee, and the purpose of the visit to notify Mr. Cleveland,\r\nofficially, of his nomination to the great office.  I saw him then\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\nHe was then Governor of New York, having been but recently elected\r\nby an unprecedented majority.  I recall him distinctly on this\r\noccasion as he responded to the eloquent speech of Colonel Vilas.\r\nStanding near him at the time were three men well known at a later\r\ndate as members of his cabinet and his closest friends, Daniel\r\nManning, William C. Whitney, and Daniel S. Lamont.\r\n\r\nCleveland's response to the speech of notification was in dignified,\r\nforceful phrase, and at once challenged public attention and gave the\r\nkeynote to the memorable contest which immediately followed.  In\r\nsome of its aspects it was a Presidential struggle the like of\r\nwhich we may not again witness.  As the day of election drew near,\r\nthe excitement increased in intensity, and no efforts that gave\r\nhopes of success were spared by the opposing party managers.\r\n\r\nThe defection from his ranks by what in campaign publications of\r\nthe day was known as the \"mugwump\" element, caused Mr. Blaine to\r\nventure upon a hazardous tour of speech-making.  Enthusiastic\r\naudiences gathered around the brilliant Republican candidate during\r\nhis Western tour.  This, however, as the sequel showed, was time\r\nand energy wasted; Illinois and Ohio were safely in the Republican\r\ncolumn, and the real battle-ground was New York state.  Homeward\r\nbound at length from this strenuous pilgrimage demanded by no party\r\nnecessity, Mr. Blaine was fated during his brief sojourn in New\r\nYork to listen to the now historical words of Burchard, words which\r\nin all human probability proved the political undoing of the\r\ncandidate to whom, with the best intentions, they were earnestly\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nNew York, as has been its wont before and since, proved the pivotal\r\nState.  For many days after the election the result was still in\r\ndoubt.  Party feeling was intense, and the result hinged upon\r\nthe narrow margin in the vote of Blaine and Cleveland in one State.\r\n\r\nDuring the strenuous days that passed from the election until\r\nthe authoritative announcement of the result, one man alone, amid the\r\nhigh tide of party passion, remained calm.  To all appearances\r\nunmoved, Grover Cleveland sat in his office day after day, no detail\r\nof official duty failing to receive his careful attention.  The\r\nfact just stated is explanatory of much in his subsequent career.\r\n\r\nWhen first nominated for the Presidency, Mr. Cleveland had\r\nlittle personal knowledge of public men outside of his own State.\r\nHow rapidly he acquired the information necessary to a successful\r\nadministration of the government was indeed a marvel.  It was no\r\n\"Cleveland luck\" or haphazard chance that called into his first Cabinet\r\nsuch men as Bayard, Manning, Garland, Vilas, and Whitney.  It can safely\r\nbe asserted that Mr. Cleveland was an excellent judge of men and of\r\ntheir capacity for the particular work assigned them.  As if by\r\nintuition, he thoroughly understood after a single interview the men\r\nwith whom he was brought in contact.  As an object lesson a better\r\nappointment to high office has rarely been made than that of Fuller\r\nto the chief justiceship of the great court.  No less fortunate was\r\nhis selection of Vilas to the responsible position of Postmaster-General.\r\nAnd yet both of these gentlemen were personally strangers to Mr. Cleveland\r\nwhen he was first named for the Presidency.  His appointments to important\r\ndiplomatic positions likewise strikingly illustrated his aptness\r\nin forming a correct estimate of men from whom his appointees were\r\nto be chosen.\r\n\r\nNo incumbent of the Presidency was ever less of a time-server than\r\nCleveland.  \"Expediency\" was a word scarcely known to his vocabulary.\r\nRecognizing alike the dignity and responsibility of the great\r\noffice, he was in the highest degree self-reliant.  None the less he\r\nat all times availed himself of the wise counsel of his official\r\nadvisers.  In matters falling within their especial province their\r\ndetermination was, except in rare instances, conclusive.  In no\r\nsense was his mind closed against the timely counsel of his friends.\r\nFar from being opinionated, in the offensive sense of the word, the\r\nultimate determination, however, was after \"having taken counsel\r\nfrom himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe incident contributing perhaps more than any other to his defeat\r\nin 1888 was his tariff-reduction message to Congress one year prior\r\nto that election.  An abler state paper has rarely been put forth.\r\nIt was a clear, succinct presentation of existing economic conditions;\r\nin very truth an unanswerable argument for tariff reduction.  It\r\nis not yet forgotten how promptly this message was denounced by\r\nthe entire opposition press as a \"free-trade manifesto,\" and how\r\nthis cry increased in voice and volume until the close of the\r\nPresidential contest.  And yet, in sending this message to Congress,\r\nMr. Cleveland was entirely consistent with himself.  Its utterances\r\nwere in clear accord with the platform upon which he had been\r\nnominated and with his letter of acceptance.  It is one of the\r\nanomalies of politics that the clear-cut sentences measurably\r\ninstrumental in compassing his defeat in 1888, were upon the banners\r\nof his triumphant partisans in the campaign of 1892.\r\n\r\nIn the year last named, Mr. Cleveland was for the third time the\r\ncandidate of his party for the Presidency.  His nomination, by a\r\ntwo-thirds vote, was upon the first ballot, and marked an era in\r\nthe history of national conventions.  His candidacy was bitterly\r\nantagonized by the delegation from his own State, his name being\r\npresented by Governor Abbott of New Jersey.  It is a fact of\r\nmuch significance that neither in the platform upon which he was\r\nnominated, nor in the letter of acceptance, was there the slightest\r\ndeparture from his emphatic utterances upon the tariff in the\r\nmemorable message of 1887.  The salient issues of the campaign were\r\n\"tariff reform\" and hostility to the then pending \"Force bill.\"\r\nFrom first to last Mr. Cleveland was in close consultation with\r\nthe leaders of his party and advised as to every detail of the\r\ncontest.  The result was a vindication of his former administration\r\nand an unmistakable endorsement of the tenets of the Democratic\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch, there can be but slight reference to the\r\nimportant questions which now for four years engaged his attention.\r\nAlmost his first official act after his second inauguration was\r\nthe withdrawal from the Senate of the Hawaiian Annexation Treaty\r\nrecently submitted by President Harrison for ratification.  Firmly\r\nbelieving that the late United States Minister to the unfortunate island\r\nhad at least acquiesced in the overthrow of the Hawaiian Government,\r\nPresident Cleveland, with the hope that he might measurably repair\r\nthe wrong, recalled the Annexation Treaty, as stated.  In his\r\nmessage of withdrawal were the words:  \"A great wrong has been done\r\nto a feeble and independent State.\"  This almost forgotten incident\r\nis now recalled only to emphasize the spirit of justice that\r\ncharacterized his dealings with foreign Governments.\r\n\r\nAnd yet history will truly say of him that, while just to other\r\nGovernments, no President has more firmly maintained the rights of\r\nhis own.  This assertion finds verification in the Venezuelan\r\nmessage, which, for the moment, almost startled the country.  By\r\nmany it was for the time believed to be the prelude to war.  In\r\nvery truth, as the sequel proved, it was a message of peace.  It\r\nwas a critical moment, and the necessity imperative for prompt,\r\ndecisive action.  If the Monroe Doctrine was to be maintained,\r\nGreat Britain could not be permitted arbitrarily to divest Venezuela\r\nof any portion of her territory.  The arbitration proposed by\r\nPresident Cleveland, resulting in peaceable adjustment, established\r\nwhat we may well believe will prove an enduring precedent.  One\r\nsentence of the memorable message is worthy of remembrance by\r\nthe oncoming generations:  \"The Monroe Doctrine was intended to\r\napply to every stage of our national life, and cannot become obsolete\r\nwhile our Republic endures.\"\r\n\r\nI had excellent opportunities to know Mr. Cleveland.  I was a member\r\nof the first and third conventions which named him for the Presidency,\r\nand actively engaged in both the contests that resulted in his\r\nelection.  As assistant Postmaster-General during his first term, and\r\nVice-President during the second, I was often \"the neighbor to his\r\ncounsels.\"  I am confident that a more conscientious, painstaking official\r\nnever filled public station.  In his appointments to office his\r\nchief aim was to subserve the public interests by judicious\r\nselections.  The question of rewarding party service, while by no\r\nmeans ignored, was immeasurably subordinate to that of the integrity\r\nand efficiency of the applicant.  He was patriotic to the core,\r\nand it was his earnest desire that the last vestige of legislation\r\ninimical to the Southern States should pass from the statute books.\r\nHe did much toward the restoration of complete concord between all\r\nsections of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland possessed a kind heart, and was ever just and generous\r\nin his dealings.  Wholly unostentatious himself, the humblest felt\r\nat ease in his presence.  Possibly no incumbent of the great office\r\nwas more easily accessible to all classes and conditions.  Courteous\r\nat all times, no guards were necessary to the preservation of\r\nhis dignity.  No one would have thought of an undue familiarity.\r\n\r\nHe was a profound student of all that pertained to human affairs.\r\nHe had given deep thought to the science of government, and was\r\nfamiliar with the best that had been written on the subject.  Caring\r\nlittle for the light literature of the day, his concern was with\r\nthe practical knowledge bearing upon existing conditions and\r\nthat might aid in the solution of the ever-recurring problems\r\nconfronting men in responsible positions.  He loved to talk of the\r\nfounders of the Government, and of the matchless instrument, the\r\nresult of their wise deliberations, declared by Gladstone, \"the\r\nmost wonderful work ever struck off at a given time from the brain\r\nand purpose of man.\"  The Constitution was in very truth \"the man of\r\nhis counsel,\" and, in my opinion, no statesman in ancient or modern\r\ntimes so challenged his profound admiration as did James Madison.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland was sociable in the best sense of that word, and the\r\ncares of state laid aside, in the company of friends he was an\r\nexceedingly agreeable companion.  While by no means the best of\r\nstory-tellers himself, he had a keen appreciation of the humorous and\r\nludicrous phases and incidents of life.  I shall not soon forget\r\nan evening I spent with him in company with Governor Proctor Knott\r\nof Kentucky.  The greatest story-teller of the age was at his best,\r\nand the delight of the occasion was, as Cleveland declared, \"beyond\r\nexpression.\"\r\n\r\nMore than once I have been a guest in his home.  During the campaign\r\nof 1892, when his associate on the national ticket, I spent some\r\ndays in conference with him at Gray Gables.  The memory of that\r\nlong-ago visit lingers yet.  He was the agreeable host, the gentleman;\r\nmore than that, the tender, considerate husband, the kind, affectionate\r\nfather.  It has never been my good fortune to cross the threshold of\r\na more delightful home.\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. Cleveland last upon the occasion of his visit to Arbor\r\nLodge, Nebraska, to deliver an address at the unveiling of a statue\r\nof the late Sterling Morton, former Secretary of Agriculture.  The\r\naddress was worthy of the occasion, and indeed a just and touching\r\ntribute to the memory of an excellent man, an able and efficient Cabinet\r\nMinister.  In my last conversation with Mr. Cleveland upon the\r\noccasion mentioned, he spoke feelingly of our old associates, many\r\nof whom had passed away.  I remember that the tears came to his\r\neyes when the name of Colonel Lamont happened to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Arbor Lodge, the beautiful Morton home, by\r\ninvitation of the superintendent, Mr. Cleveland visited the\r\nState Asylum for the Blind at Nebraska City.  In his brief address\r\nto the unfortunate inmates of the institution, Mr. Cleveland\r\nmentioned the fact that in his early life he had been for some time\r\na teacher in an asylum for the blind, and spoke of his profound\r\ninterest in whatever concerned their welfare.  I have heard him\r\nmany times, but never when he appeared to better advantage, or\r\nevinced such depth of feeling as upon this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe passing of Cleveland marks an epoch.  He was indeed a striking\r\nfigure in American history.  Take him all in all, we may not\r\nlook upon his like again.  The \"good citizenship,\" an expression\r\nfrequently on his lips, to which he would have his countrymen\r\naspire, was of the noblest, and no man had a clearer or loftier\r\nconception of the responsible and sacred character of public station.\r\nWith him the oft-quoted words, \"A public office is a public trust,\"\r\nwas no mere lip-service.  His will be a large place in history.  His\r\nadministration of the government will safely endure the test of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n  \"Whatever record leaps to light,\r\n  He never can be shamed.\"\r\n\r\nIn victory or defeat, in office or out, he was true to his own self\r\nand to his ideals.  His early struggles, his firmness of purpose, his\r\ndetermination that knew no shadow of wavering, his exalted aims,\r\nand the success that ultimately crowned his efforts have given him\r\nhigh place among statesmen, and will be a continuing inspiration\r\nto the oncoming generations of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\nA UNANIMOUS CHOICE FOR SPEAKER\r\n\r\nA MEETING OF PROSPECTIVE SPEAKERS--DR. ROGERS WITHIN SIGHT OF\r\nTHE GOAL OF HIS AMBITION--HE STATES THE GROUND OF HIS HOPE--THE\r\nFOUNDATION PROVES TO BE ONLY SAND--A TEMPEST CALMED BY THE DOCTOR.\r\n\r\nAt a banquet in Washington in the winter of 1880-81, a large number\r\nof Representatives were present.  Among the number were Reed,\r\nMcKinley, Cannon, and Keifer.  These gentlemen were all prospective\r\ncandidates for the Speakership of the then recently elected House of\r\nRepresentatives.  The best of feeling prevailed, and the occasion\r\nwas one of rare enjoyment and mirth.  Each candidate in turn was\r\nintroduced by the toast-master as \"the Speaker of the next House,\"\r\nand in his speech each claimed all the others as his enthusiastic and\r\nreliable supporters.  The apparent confidence of each candidate in\r\nthe support of his rivals reminded Mr. Cannon of the experience of\r\nan Illinois legislator, which he requested his colleague from\r\nthe Bloomington district to relate.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may appreciate the incident then related, some\r\nmention must be made of Dr. Thomas P. Rogers of Bloomington.  He\r\nwas a gentleman of the old school, a politician from the beginning,\r\nof inflexible integrity and an earnestness of purpose that knew no\r\nshadow of turning.  He was as devoid of any possible touch of humor\r\nas was his own marble bust of Thomas Jefferson.  He was the personal\r\nfriend of Lincoln and of Douglas, and the political follower of\r\nthe latter.  The fondness of a mother for her first-born hardly\r\nexceeded that of Dr. Rogers for the party of his choice.  Any\r\nuncomplimentary allusion to his \"principles\" was considered a\r\npersonal injury, and his devotion to party leaders, from Jackson\r\nto Douglas, savored of idolatry.  Some camp-meeting experiences in\r\nearly life had given zest and tone to his style of oratory,\r\nwhich stood him well in hand in his many political encounters of\r\na later day.\r\n\r\nFor three consecutive terms the Doctor had been a member of the\r\nLegislature, and his record from every point of view was without\r\na blemish.  At his fourth election, it was found that for the first\r\ntime in a decade or more his party had secured a majority in the\r\nHouse, to which the Doctor had just been elected.  The goal of his\r\nambition was the Speakership, and it truly seemed that his hour\r\nhad now come.\r\n\r\nSoon after these facts were known beyond peradventure, the Doctor came\r\none day into my office.  After election matters had been talked\r\nover at length and with much satisfaction, the Doctor modestly\r\nintimated a desire to be a candidate for the Speakership.  I at\r\nonce gave him the promise of my earnest support and inquired whether\r\nhe had any friends upon whom he could rely in the approaching\r\ncaucus.  He assured me that there were four members of the last\r\nHouse re-elected to this, upon whom he knew he could absolutely\r\ndepend under all circumstances.  Upon my inquiry as to their names,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"Hadlai,\"--the Doctor, it may be here mentioned, had from my boyhood\r\nkindly given me the benefit of an \"H\" to which I laid no claim and\r\nwas in no way entitled--\"Hadlai, you take your pencil and take down\r\ntheir names as I give them to you.\"\r\n\r\nI at once took my seat, and pencil in hand, looked inquiringly\r\ntoward the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Hadlai,\" he continued, \"put down Heise of Cook.  John and I\r\nhave been friends for more than thirty years; I worked for him for\r\na delegate-at-large to the last National Convention, and he told\r\nme then, 'Doctor, if there is anything I can do for you, just let me\r\nknow.'\"\r\n\r\nTo which I replied, \"Heise of Cook, dead sure,\" and his name was\r\nat once placed in the Rogers column.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hadlai,\" continued the Doctor, \"there is Armstrong of La\r\nSalle; Wash and I were boys together in Ohio, and sat side by side\r\nin the Charleston Convention when we were trying to nominate Douglas.\r\nHe has told me more than once that if ever we carried the House,\r\nhe was for me for Speaker above any man on earth.\"  At which I\r\nunhesitatingly placed Armstrong of La Salle in the same column with\r\nHeise of Cook.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hadlai,\" continued the Doctor, after a moment's pause, \"there\r\nis Cummins of Fulton; I helped elect Jim Chairman of the last State\r\nConvention, and he has told me again and again that he hoped he\r\nwould live to see me Speaker, so I can count on Jim without doubt.\"\r\n\r\nI at once placed Cummins in the column of honor with Heise and\r\nArmstrong, and calmly awaited further instructions.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hadlai, there is Moore of Adams; Alf got into trouble over\r\na bill he had in the last Legislature; he could neither get it out\r\nof the committee, nor the committee to take any action, so he came\r\nover to my seat terribly worried, and says he, 'Doctor, for\r\nGod's sake, get me out of this!'  I did, Hadlai, and Alf was the\r\nmost grateful man you ever saw on earth, and told me then, 'Doctor,\r\nI would get up at two o'clock at night to do you a favor.'  I\r\ncan safely count on him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that Moore of Adams rounded out the quartette\r\nof faithful supporters.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hadlai,\" remarked the Doctor, after contemplating with apparent\r\nsatisfaction the list I had handed him, \"if you will give me\r\nsome paper and envelopes and a pen and some stamps, if you have\r\nthem handy, I will write to all of them now.\"  The articles mentioned\r\nwere produced, the letters written, stamped, and duly mailed, and\r\nthe good Doctor departed in an exceedingly comfortable frame of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nTime passes, as is its wont; but for some weeks I neither saw\r\nnor heard from the Doctor.  Meeting him on the street at length,\r\nI at once inquired whether he had received replies to his letters.\r\n\r\n\"Come into the office, Hadlai, and I will explain.\"  Pained to\r\nobserve that the tone and air of confidence so perceptible in\r\nour last interview was lacking, I followed with some misgiving into\r\nhis office.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Hadlai,\" he slowly began, \"I have heard from all of them.\r\nHeise of Cook [the familiar appellations of the former interview\r\nwere wanting] writes assuring me that there is no man living for\r\nwhom he entertains a more profound respect then for myself, Hadlai;\r\nbut that owing to unforseen complications arising in his county,\r\nhe has reluctantly consented _to allow his own name_ to be presented\r\nto the caucus.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Heise of Cook was immediately stricken from the head\r\nof the list.  Then a reverie into which the Doctor had fallen was at\r\nlength disturbed by my inquiry, \"What about Armstrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Hadlai, Armstrong of La Salle writes me that in his judgment\r\nthere is no man living so deserving of the gratitude of the party,\r\nor so well qualified for the office of Speaker as myself, but that\r\nthe pressure from his constituents has been so great that he has\r\n_finally consented to allow his own name_ to be presented to the\r\ncaucus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fare-you-well, Mr. Armstrong,\" was my hurried observation, as the\r\nname of that gentleman disappeared from my list.\r\n\r\nArousing the Doctor at length from the reverie into which he had\r\nagain fallen, I ventured to inquire as to the state of mind of Mr.\r\nCummins.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Hadlai, Cummins of Fulton says that in a certain contingency\r\n_he will himself be a candidate,_ and Moore of Adams writes me that\r\n_he is a candidate!\"_\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to supplement this little narrative\r\nby relating an incident that illustrates the fact that a man wholly\r\ndevoid of any sense of humor himself may at times be the unconscious\r\ncause of amusement in others.\r\n\r\nImprimis:  The Doctor, while a member of the General Assembly,\r\nvoted for a measure known in local parlance as \"the Lake Front\r\nBill.\"  The criticisms which followed vexed his righteous soul,\r\nand he patiently awaited the opportunity for public explanation\r\nand personal vindication.\r\n\r\nNow it so fell out that at the time whereof we write there was much\r\nexcitement--a tempest in a tea-pot--in the little city of Bloomington,\r\nover a change in \"readers\" recently ordered in the schools by\r\nthe Board of Education.  After much discussion on the streets and at\r\nthe corners, a public indignation meeting was called for Saturday evening\r\nat the east door of the Court-house.  Meanwhile the indignation\r\nagainst the offending Board intensified, and there was some\r\napprehension even of serious trouble.  At the appointed time and\r\nplace, the meeting assembled and was duly organized by the selection\r\nof a Chairman.  Calls at once began for well-known orators at\r\nthe bar and upon the hustings.  \"Ewing,\" \"Fifer,\" \"Rowell,\" \"Prince,\"\r\n\"Lillard,\" \"Phillips,\" \"Kerrick,\" \"Weldon,\" were heard from the\r\ncrowd in rapid succession.  It was like \"calling spirits from\r\nthe vasty deep.\"  No response was given, no orator appeared; and, as\r\nis well known, an indignation meeting without an orator is as\r\nimpossible as \"Hamlet\" with the Prince of Denmark omitted.\r\n\r\nBut sure enough--\r\n\r\n  \"Fortune sometimes brings in boats that are not steered.\"\r\n\r\nAt the auspicious moment, from the rear of the crowd Tom Hullinger\r\ncalled out, \"Doctor Rogers, Doctor Rogers!\"  The hour had struck.\r\nWithout waiting further call, the Doctor promptly took the stand\r\nand waiving the formality of an introduction, began:\r\n\r\n\"I am deeply gratified to have this opportunity to explain to my\r\nfellow-citizens who have known me from my early manhood my vote\r\nupon the Lake Front Bill,\" _and a two-hour vindication immediately\r\nfollowed._  No allusion being made to the object of the meeting,\r\nor the change of school-books, of which the Doctor knew as little and\r\ncared as little as he did of the thirteenth century controversy\r\nbetween the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, with the waning hours the\r\nexcitement subsided.  The change of readers became a dead issue;\r\nthe era of good feeling was restored; and to this blessed hour,\r\nexcept in a spirit of mirth, _the school-book question has never\r\nbeen mentioned._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\nA LAWYER OF THE OLD SCHOOL\r\n\r\nJUDGE ARRINGTON, THE IDEAL LAWYER--EULOGIZED BY OTHER JUDGES--BOOKS\r\nHIS EARLY COMPANIONS--BECOMES SUCCESSIVELY A METHODIST PREACHER,\r\nA LAWYER, AND A JUDGE--WRITES SOME SKETCHES OF LIFE IN THE SOUTHWEST\r\n--HIS APOSTROPHE TO WATER RECITED BY GOUGH.\r\n\r\nIn the old Supreme Court-room at Ottawa, almost a half-century ago,\r\nI saw and heard Judge Alfred A. Arrington for the first time.  For\r\ntwo hours I listened with the deepest attention to his masterly\r\nargument in a cause then exciting much interest because of the\r\nlarge amount involved.  The dry question of law under discussion, \"as\r\nif touched by the enchanter's wand,\" was at once invested with\r\nan interest far beyond its wont.  As I listened to the argument of\r\nJudge Arrington, and witnessed the manner of its delivery, he\r\nappeared in the most comprehensive sense the ideal lawyer.  He\r\nseemed, indeed, as he probably was, the sole survivor of the school\r\nof which Wirt and Pinckney were three generations ago the\r\ntypical representatives.  His dignified bearing, old-time apparel,\r\nand lofty courtesy toward the Court and opposing counsel, all\r\nstrengthened this impression.  He had a highly attractive appearance,\r\nand as was said by a contemporary, \"to crown all, a massive\r\nWebsterian forehead, needing no seal to give the world assurance of\r\na man.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Sage he stood,\r\n  With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear\r\n  The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look\r\n  Drew audience and attention still as night\r\n  Or summer's noontide air.\"\r\n\r\nSince then I have listened to advocates of national renown in\r\nour great court and in the Senate sitting as a High Court of\r\nImpeachment, but at no time or place have I heard an abler, more\r\nscholarly, or more eloquent argument than that of Judge Arrington in\r\nthe old court-room at Ottawa, Illinois, on that day long gone by.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent members of the Chicago bar were the eulogists\r\nof Judge Arrington when he passed to his grave, near the close\r\nof the great Civil War.  Judge Wilson, in presenting resolutions\r\nin honor of the deceased, voiced the sentiments of his associates when\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\"For more than thirty years at the bar and upon the bench, I\r\nhave been associated with the legal profession; and I may say\r\nwithout offence that of the many able men I have known I regard\r\nJudge Arrington, take him all in all, as the ablest.\"\r\n\r\nThe venerable Judge Drummond said:\r\n\r\n\"I have rarely heard a man whose efforts so constantly riveted the\r\nattention from the beginning to the close of his discourse.  For\r\nwhile he trod with firm and steady steps the path of logic, his\r\nvivid imagination was constantly scattering on each side flowers\r\nof fragrant beauty, to the wonder and delight of all who heard him.\r\nHe was a great lawyer in the highest and largest sense of the term\r\n--great in the extent and thoroughness of his legal learning, in\r\nthe vigor and acuteness of his reasoning, and in the power of\r\nhis eloquence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Melville W. Fuller, the present Chief Justice of the United\r\nStates, said:\r\n\r\n\"When he arose to discuss a question, he exhibited a perfect\r\nknowledge of every phase in which it could be presented; and men\r\nnever grew weary (especially if the argument involved Constitutional\r\nconstruction, in which department he stood _primus inter illustres_)\r\nof admiring the amplitude of his legal attainments, the accuracy\r\nof his learning, the compactness of his logic, and the majestic\r\nflow of his eloquence, and more than all, that firmness and breadth\r\nof mind which lifted him above the ordinary contest of the forum.\r\n\r\n\"It is a source of the deepest consolation that he found peace\r\nat the last; that the grand spirit, before it took its everlasting\r\nflight, reposed in confidence on the Book of Books; that its\r\ndeparture was illumined by that precious light which ever\r\nrenders radiant the brief darkness 'twixt mortal twilight and\r\nimmortal dawn.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, alas, his name has now almost passed from the memories of\r\nmen; the veil of time has settled over him; no distinct image is\r\nrecalled by the mention of his name.  How suggestive this, of\r\nthe ephemeral fame of even a great lawyer:\r\n\r\n  \"Swift as shadow, short as any dream\r\n  Brief as the lightning in the collied night.\"\r\n\r\nWords long since uttered by an eminent jurist have not lost\r\ntheir significance:\r\n\r\n\"There is, perhaps, no reputation that can be achieved amongst men\r\nthat is so transitory, so evanescent, as that of a great advocate.\r\nThe very wand that enchants us is magical.  Its effects can be\r\nfelt; it influences our actions; it controls and possesses us; but\r\nto define it, or tell what it is, or how it produces these effects,\r\nis as far beyond our power as to imprison the sunbeam.  In the\r\npresence of such majestic power we can only stand awed and silent.\"\r\n\r\nThere was much of romance, and somewhat of mystery, that gathered about\r\nthe life of Judge Arrington.  Born of humble parentage in the pine\r\nforests of North Carolina, with no advantages other than those\r\ncommon in the remoter parts of our country a century ago, from the\r\nbeginning he apparently dwelt apart from the conditions surrounding\r\nhim.  At an early age he removed with his father's family to the\r\nthen wilds of the Southwest.\r\n\r\nThere, upon the very border line of civilization, his associates\r\nfor a time were the advance guard, the adventurers and soldiers of\r\nfortune that in a large measure constituted the civilization of\r\nthe southwestern frontier during the early years of the last century.\r\nWith his early environment, his subsequent career seems a marvel.\r\nIt can only be explained upon the supposition that through with\r\nthem, he was not of them.\r\n\r\n  \"His soul was like a star, and dwelt apart.\"\r\n\r\nHis companions were his books.  Denied the advantages of early\r\nscholastic training, he was, from the beginning, an omnivorous\r\nreader.  He cared little for the allurements and excitement of\r\nsociety.  At the age of seventeen, he joined the Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch, and was soon after licensed to preach.  For four years\r\nhe rode the circuit, enduring all the discomforts and dangers then\r\nand there incident to his calling.  His field may be called the\r\n_Ultima Thule,_ bordering upon the Rio Grande and inhabited by\r\nIndians.  Untutored audiences were stirred to the depths by his\r\nfervid appeals.  Church buildings were yet in the future; the\r\ncongregations assembled in God's first temples, and listened\r\nwith rapt attention to the fiery eloquence of the delicate, youthful\r\nmessenger, whose soul seemed on fire.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who had heard Arrington writes:\r\n\r\n\"He was then young, delicate, as brilliant as a comet, and almost as\r\nerratic.  Without research or mental discipline, he could electrify\r\nan audience beyond all living men, and arouse in the minds of those\r\nwho heard him the wildest enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nFor some cause, possibly never to be explained, he suddenly abandoned\r\nthe ministry, began the study of the law, and when a little past\r\nthe age of twenty-one, was admitted to the bar.  After some years of\r\nsuccessful practice in the rude frontier courts of Arkansas, he\r\nremoved to Texas, where he was soon appointed a judge, and assigned\r\nto the Rio Grande circuit.  In addition to his judicial labors, he\r\nnow wrote and published some graphic and interesting sketches of\r\nborder life, vivid pictures of conditions then existing in the\r\nSouthwest among a people the like of which we shall not see agin,\r\na people upon whom the restraints and amenities of civilized life sat\r\nbut lightly, who were in large degree a law unto themselves, and\r\nwith whom revenge was virtue.\r\n\r\nOne of his publications, \"Paul Denton,\" still has a place in many of\r\nour libraries.  It is, in part, a narrative of the thrilling\r\nexperiences of an early Methodist circuit-rider--presumably himself\r\n--upon the southwest border.  In this will be found his marvellous\r\napostrophe to water, which, as was said by Judge Dent, \"was so\r\nfamiliar to the lecture-going public of the last generation owing to\r\nits frequent declamation from the rostrum by the temperance lecturer,\r\nGough.\"\r\n\r\nThe hero of the book, Paul Denton, had been announced to preach at\r\na famous Spring, where \"plenty of good liquor\" was promised to all\r\nwho would attend.  During the sermon, a desperado demanded:\r\n\"Mr. Denton, where is the liquor you promised?\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" answered the preacher in tones of thunder, and pointing\r\nhis motionless finger at a spring gushing up in two strong columns\r\nfrom the bosom of the earth with a sound like a shout of joy.\r\n\"There,\" he repeated, \"there is the liquor which God the Eternal\r\nbrews for all his children.  Not in the simmering still over the\r\nsmoky fires choked with poisonous gases, surrounded with stench of\r\nsickening odors and corruptions, doth your Father in heaven prepare\r\nthe precious essence of life--pure cold water; but in the green\r\nglade and grassy dell, where the red-deer wanders and the child\r\nloves to play, there God brews it; and down, low down, in the\r\ndeepest valleys, where the fountains murmur, and the rills sigh, and\r\nhigh upon the mountain-tops where the naked granite glitters\r\nlike gold in the sun, where the storm-cloud broods and the\r\nthunder-storms crash; and far out on the wide, wild sea, where the\r\nhurricane howls music and the big waves roll the chorus, sweeping the\r\nmarch of God--there he brews it, the beverage of life, health-giving\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"And everywhere it is a thing of life and beauty--gleaming in\r\nthe dew-drop; singing in the summer rain; shining in the ice gem\r\ntill the trees all seem turned to living jewels; spreading a golden\r\nveil over the sun or a white gauze around the midnight moon; sporting\r\nin the glacier; folding its bright snow-curtain softly about the\r\nwintry world; and weaving the many-colored bow whose warp is the\r\nrain-drops of earth, whose woof is the sunbeam of heaven, all\r\ncheckered over with the mystic hand of refraction.\r\n\r\n\"Still it is beautiful, that blessed life-water!  No poisonous\r\nbubbles are on its brink; its foam brings not murder and madness;\r\nno blood stains its liquid glass; pale widows and starving orphans\r\nweep not burning tears into its depths; no drunkard's shrieking\r\nghost from the grave curses it in the world of eternal despair.\r\nBeautiful, pure, blessed, and glorious.  Speak out, my friends,\r\nwould you exchange it for the demon's drink, alcohol?\"\r\n\r\nIn Calvary Cemetery, Chicago, rests all that is mortal of Judge\r\nArrington.\r\n\r\n  \"Tread lightly on his ashes, ye men of genius, for\r\n  he was your kinsman!\r\n  Weed clean his grave, ye men of goodness, for\r\n  he was your brother!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\nHIGH DEBATE IN THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nCOLONEL WOOLFORD, A HERO UNDER GENERAL ZACHARY TAYLOR--HIS MANNER OF\r\nFIGHTING--HIS DEFENCE OF A YOUTH CHARGED WITH MURDER--HE MAKES A\r\nSPEECH THAT INFURIATES GENERAL FRY.\r\n\r\nOne of the men not easily forgotten was the Hon. Frank Woolford,\r\na member of Congress from the mountains of Kentucky nearly a quarter\r\nof a century ago.  He was without reservation a typical mountaineer.\r\nHe practised law in the local courts, and was prominent in the\r\npolitics of his State.  His style of oratory bore little resemblance\r\nto that of the British House of Lords.  He had been a soldier in two\r\nwars, and his dauntless courage and inexhaustible good humor made him\r\nthe idol of his comrades.  He had been of the heroic band of\r\n\"Old Rough and Ready\" that repelled the charge of twenty thousand lancers\r\nunder Santa Ana at Buena Vista.  He was as brave as Marshal Ney,\r\nand it was said of him that the battle-field was his home as the\r\nupper air was that of the eagle.\r\n\r\nHe promptly espoused the cause of the Union at the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War and was chosen Colonel of a mounted regiment gathered\r\nfrom his own and adjacent counties.  He knew how to fight, but\r\nof the science of war as taught in the schools he was as ignorant as\r\nthe grave.  It was said that his entire tactics were embraced in\r\ntwo commands:  \"Huddle and fight,\" and \"Scatter.\"  When the\r\nfirst was heard his men \"huddled and fit\"; and when retreat was the\r\nonly possible salvation, the command to \"scatter\" was obeyed\r\nwith equal alacrity.  Each man was now for himself, and \"devil take\r\nthe hindmost\" for a time, but the sound of Woolford's bugle\r\nnever failed to secure prompt falling into line at the auspicious moment.\r\n\"Woolford's cavalry\" was the synonym for daring, even at the\r\ntime when the recital of the deeds of brave men filled the world's\r\ngreat ear.\r\n\r\nWoolford and his troopers were in the thickest of the fight at Mill\r\nSpring, where Zollicoffer fell; later, they hung upon the flanks\r\nof Bragg on his retreat southward from the bloody field of Perryville.\r\nMore than once during those troublous times our hero was a \"foeman\r\nworthy the steel\" of John Morgan, Forrest, and the gallant Joe\r\nWheeler of world renown.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war, Colonel Woolford returned to his mountain\r\nhome and was in due time elected a Representative in Congress.\r\nYears later, with life well rounded out, he met the only foe to\r\nwhom he ever surrendered, and lamented by all, passed to the beyond.\r\n\r\nSome faint idea of Colonel Woolford's style of eloquence at the\r\nbar may possibly be gathered from the following.  He was retained to\r\ndefend a half-grown, illiterate youth under indictment for murder.\r\nThe crime was committed near \"Jimtown,\" but by a change of venue\r\nthe trial took place at Danville, in the neighboring county of\r\nBoyle.  Danville, it must be remembered, was the Athens of Kentucky.\r\nIt was the seat of Centre College, of a Presbyterian theological\r\nSeminary, and of more than one of the public institutions of the\r\nState.  It was the home of men of prominence and wealth, and for\r\nthree generations had been renowned for the high character,\r\nattainments, and culture of its people.\r\n\r\nIn his speech to the jury in behalf of his unfortunate client, the\r\nColonel insisted that the poor boy at the bar of justice, born and\r\nreared in the mountains, without any of the advantages of churches\r\nand schools, was not to be held in the same degree responsible\r\nas if his lot had been cast in Danville.  In his argument he said:\r\n\r\n\"Here you have your schools, your Centre College, your Theological\r\nSeminary, your churches.  Every third man you meet on the streets is\r\na minister of the Gospel, and the others are all teachers in the\r\nSunday school.  Here you have your great preachers, Young,\r\nGreen, Humphreys, Yerkes, Robertson, Breckenridge--in fact,\r\nPresbyterianism to your hearts' content in the very air.  But this\r\npoor boy has known nothing of these things.  O gentlemen, what\r\nmight not this poor boy have been, and what might not poor Jimtown\r\nhave been, with all these advantages?\"\r\n\r\nThrowing up his arms, in tragic tones he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jimtown!  Jimtown!  Had the mighty things that have been done\r\nin Danville been done in thee, thou wouldst long since have repented\r\nin sackcloth and ashes!\"\r\n\r\nThe incident which I shall now relate was told me by my kinsman,\r\nGeneral S. S. Fry of Danville.  He and Colonel Woolford were friends\r\nfrom boyhood, and comrades in the Mexican and Civil wars.  Their\r\nparty affiliations, however, were different, General Fry being a\r\nRepublican, and Colonel Woolford a Democrat.\r\n\r\nDuring the reconstruction period, soon after the close of the Civil\r\nwar, a barbecue was given to the Colonel, then a candidate for\r\nCongress, in one of the mountain counties of his district.  As a\r\nmatter of course, the Colonel was to be the orator of the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn order, if possible, to counteract the evil effect of his speech,\r\nthe Republican State Committee requested General Fry to attend the\r\nbarbecue, and engage Colonel Woolford in public debate.  In compliance\r\nwith this request, General Fry, after a horseback ride of many\r\nhours, put in an appearance at the appointed time and place.\r\nThe attendance was general; the people of the entire county, of\r\nboth sexes and of all ages and conditions, were there.  The barbecue\r\nwas well under way when General Fry arrived.  A table of rough\r\nboards and of sufficient length had been constructed, and was\r\nliterally covered with savory shote and mutton just from the pit\r\nwhere barbecued.  These viands were abundantly supplemented with\r\nfried chicken, salt-rising bread, beaten biscuit, \"corn dodgers,\" and\r\ncucumber pickles.  To this add several representatives of the highly\r\nrespectable pie family, and possibly an occasional pound cake, and\r\nthe typical barbecue is before you.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fry, upon his arrival, was warmly greeted by Colonel\r\nWoolford, whose hearty invitation _to partake_ was not limited\r\nto the viands mentioned.  The feast being at length happily concluded,\r\nand the crowd assembled around the speaker's stand, Colonel Woolford\r\nsaid to his old-time comrade;  \"Now, General Fry, you just go ahead\r\nand speak just as long as you want to.  The boys have all heard me\r\ntime and again, and I have nothing new to tell them, but they will\r\nbe glad to hear you.  When you get through, of course, if there is\r\na little time left, I may say 'howdy' to the boys, and talk a little\r\nwhile, but you just go ahead.\"\r\n\r\nAfter formal introduction by the Colonel, General Fry did \"go\r\nahead,\" and discuss the financial question, the tariff, reconstruction,\r\nand dwelt earnestly and at length upon the magnanimity of the\r\nRepublican party toward the men lately in rebellion against the\r\nGovernment.  Since the surrender at Appomattox, no life had been\r\ntaken, no one punished, no man ever put on his trial.  It was\r\nwithout a parallel in history, and as a matter of simple gratitude,\r\nthe Republican party was entitled to the support of the entire\r\nSouthern people for such magnanimity.\r\n\r\nThe speech at length concluded, Colonel Woolford arose and without\r\neven the formality of saying \"howdy,\" or honoring finance or tariff\r\nwith the briefest mention, proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"General Fry has dwelt long and loud upon the magnanimity of the\r\nRepublican party.  He has told you that when the war was over\r\nand the last rebel had laid down his arms, a hand-shaking took\r\nplace all around, everybody was forgiven, and the peace of heaven came\r\ndown like a dove upon the whole Southern people.  Yes--a hell of\r\na magnanimity it was!  How did they show the magnanimity that\r\nGeneral Fry talks so much about?  You all remember Stonewall Jackson,\r\none of the grandest men God ever made.  This same magnanimous\r\nRepublican party took him prisoner, tried him by a drumhead\r\ncourt-martial, and shot him down like a mad dog after he had\r\nsurrendered up his sword.\"\r\n\r\nAt which Colonel Fry interposed:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Colonel Woolford, you ought not to make such a statement\r\nas that.  Stonewall Jackson was accidentally shot by one of his\r\nown men in battle, and his memory is honored by all the people\r\nNorth and South.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the Colonel replied:\r\n\r\n\"Don't try to deceive these people.  We don't put on style and wear\r\nstore clothes like you big folks down about Danville, but we live in\r\nour plain way, wear our home-spun and eat our hog and hominy; but if\r\nthere is anything on earth that these people do love, it is the\r\n_truth._  What did this same magnanimous Republican party that\r\nGeneral Fry had told you so much about do with General Robert E.\r\nLee?  I knew General Lee, I served with him in Mexico, and although\r\nwe fought on different sides in the last war, I always respected\r\nhim as a brave soldier.  Well, after he had surrendered at Appomattox,\r\nand his men had all laid down their arms, what did this same\r\nmagnanimous party that General Fry talked so much about do with\r\nGeneral Lee?  Why, they tried him by a drumhead court-martial _and\r\nshot and quartered him right on the spot!\"_\r\n\r\nAgain interrupting, General Fry indignantly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"It is an outrage, Colonel Woolford, to attempt to deceive these\r\npeople by such statements.  General Lee was never even imprisoned,\r\nand is still alive, the president of a college in Virginia, and\r\nhighly esteemed by everybody.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel answered:\r\n\r\n\"Now, General Fry, you have been treated like a gentleman ever\r\nsince you came to these mountains; we gave you the best we had\r\nto eat, gave you the last drop out of the bottle, and listened\r\nquietly to you just as long as you wanted to speak.  We don't wear\r\nSunday clothes, General Fry, like you do down in Danville, but just\r\nlive in our plain way in our log cabins, and eat our hoe-cake, and\r\nsay our prayers, but if there is anything on God's earth that we\r\ndo love, it is the _truth._  It is wrong for you, General Fry,\r\nto try and fool these people.  Yes, this same magnanimous party\r\nthat General Fry has been telling you about, what did they do with\r\npoor old Jeff Davis after he was captured?  Now, I never was fond of\r\nold Jeff myself, and I fought four years against him in the last\r\nwar.  But I was on the same side with him in Mexico, I saw him head\r\nthe charge of the Mississippi rifles, and drive back the Mexican\r\nlancers after McKee and Clay and Hardin had been killed at Buena\r\nVista, and I know he was no coward.  Well, after he was in prison and\r\nas helpless as a child, what did they do with him?  Why, they just\r\ntook him out, and without even giving him a drumhead trial, tied\r\nhim up and _burned him to ashes at a stake!\"_\r\n\r\nFry sprang to his feet, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Great God!  Jeff Davis is still alive, at his home in Mississippi,\r\nand has never even been tried; it is damnable to make such statements\r\nto these people, Colonel Woolford!\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel thereupon, with a deeply injured air, said:\r\n\r\n\"General Fry, you and I have been friends a life-time.  We\r\nhooked watermelons, hunted coons, and attended all the frolics\r\ntogether when we were boys.  We slept under the same blanket,\r\nbelonged to the same mess, and fought side by side at Palo Alto\r\nand Cerro Gordo; we shed our blood on the same battlefields when\r\nfighting to save this glorious Union.  I have loved you, General\r\nFry, like a brother, but this is too much, it is putting friendship\r\nto a turrible test; it is a little more than flesh and blood can\r\nstand.\"\r\n\r\nPausing for a moment, he apparently recovered himself from the deep\r\nemotion he had just shown, then quietly resuming, he said, \"What\r\nI have said about the way they treated old Jeff is true, and here is\r\nmy witness.\"  He called out, \"Bill, tell the General what you\r\nsaw them do with old Jeff.\"\r\n\r\nBill, a tall, lank, one-gallowsed mountaineer, leaning against a\r\nsapling near by, promptly deposed that he was present at the time,\r\nsaw old Jeff led out, tied to a stake and finally disappear in a\r\npuff of smoke.  At this, General Fry, without the formality of a\r\nfarewell, immediately shook the mountain dust from his feet, mounted\r\nhis horse, and, looking neither to the right nor to the left,\r\nretraced his steps to Danville, and without delay informed the\r\nState Committee that if they wanted _any further joint debates with\r\nold Frank Woolford,_ they would have to send some one else.\r\n\r\nYears after, seated at my desk in the Postoffice Department in\r\nWashington, after I had appointed a few cross-road postmasters for\r\nCongressman Woolford, I ventured to inquire of him whether he\r\nhad ever had a joint debate with General Fry.  With a suppressed\r\nchuckle, and a quaint gleam of his remaining eye, he significantly\r\nreplied, _\"It won't do, Colonel, to believe everything you hear!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\nTHE SAGE OF THE BAR\r\n\r\nWITTY SAYINGS OF MR. EVARTS--HE DEFENDS PRESIDENT JOHNSON BEFORE\r\nTHE COURT OF IMPEACHMENT--DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO THE REAL CHARACTER\r\nOF THAT TRIBUNAL--MR. BOUTWELL'S ATTEMPT TO INDICATE THE PUNISHMENT\r\nMERITED BY THE PRESIDENT--MR. EVARTS'S REPLY--EXCHANGE OF COURTESIES\r\nBY MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe late William M. Evarts, at one time the head of the American\r\nbar, said many things in his lighter moments worthy of remembrance.\r\n\r\nUpon his retirement from the bar to accept the position of Secretary\r\nof State, a farewell dinner was given him by prominent lawyers\r\nof New York.  The appointments, viands, etc., it is needless to\r\nobserve were all after the most approved style.  Somewhat out of\r\nwont, however, a magnificent goose with all its appurtenances\r\nand suitably dished was placed immediately in front of the guest\r\nof honor.\r\n\r\nThe grosser part of the feast concluded, the toast was proposed:\r\n\"The Sage of the Bar.\"  Slowly arising, Mr. Evarts surveyed for\r\na moment the dish before him, and began:  \"What a wonderful\r\ntransition!  An hour ago you beheld a goose stuffed with sage; _you\r\nnow behold a sage stuffed with goose!\"_\r\n\r\nIt is not entirely forgotten that during the administration of\r\nwhich Mr. Evarts was a part, total abstinence was faithfully enforced\r\nin the great dining-room of the Executive Mansion upon all occasions.\r\nTo those who knew the Secretary of State, it is hardly necessary\r\nto say that he had little sympathy with this arrangement, that\r\nto him it was a custom \"more honored in the breach than the\r\nobservance.\"\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that at a state dinner, upon a time, a mild\r\npunch in thimbleful instalments was served to the guests in lieu\r\nof more generous beverages.  Raising the tiny vessel and bowing to\r\nthe Austrian Ambassador at his side, Mr. Evarts in undertone significantly\r\nobserved, \"Life-saving station!\"\r\n\r\nTo a \"candid friend\"--from whom God preserve us--who once took him\r\nto task for his lengthy and somewhat involved sentences, Evarts\r\nreplied, \"Oh, you are not the first man I ever encountered _who\r\nobjected to a long sentence.\"_\r\n\r\nDuring his official term above mentioned, Mr. Evarts accompanied\r\na prominent member of the British Parliament to Mount Vernon.\r\nStanding in front of the old mansion, so dear to all American\r\nhearts, the distinguished visitor, looking across to the opposite shore,\r\nremarked:  \"I read in a history that when Washington was a boy\r\nhe threw a dollar across the Potomac; remarkable indeed that he\r\ncould have thrown a dollar so far, a mile away across the Potomac;\r\nvery remarkable indeed, I declare.\"  \"Yes,\" replied Evarts, \"but you\r\nmust remember that _a dollar would go a great deal farther then\r\nthan it does now.\"_\r\n\r\nThis incident being told to a member of Congress of Hibernian\r\nantecedents, he immediately replied:  \"Yes, he might have told the\r\nBritisher that when Washington was a boy he sure enough threw a\r\ndollar across the Potomac, and when he got to be a grown-up man,\r\n_he threw a sovereign across the Atlantic.\"_\r\n\r\nMr. Evarts was counsel for President Johnson in his famous arraignment\r\nbefore the Senate, sitting as a High Court of Impeachment.  His\r\nspeech, lasting many hours, was an able and exhaustive discussion of\r\nthe salient questions involved in the trial.  The leading managers\r\nupon the part of the House of Representatives were Benjamin F.\r\nButler, George S. Boutwell, and John A. Bingham.  The retort\r\ncourteous was freely indulged in many times by the managers and\r\ncounsel from the beginning to the close of the long-drawn-out\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, and to this generation renders the entire\r\nproceeding measurably farcical, that the managers upon the part of\r\nthe House, and the counsel for the impeached President, were at\r\ncross-purposes from the beginning as to the real character of\r\nthe tribunal before which they were appearing.  The latter regarded\r\nit as a court, and constantly addressed its presiding officer, the\r\nChief Justice of the United States, as \"Your Honor\"; while the\r\nformer insisted that it was only the Senate, and continually\r\naddressed the Chief Justice as \"Mr. President.\"\r\n\r\nThe issues involved were likewise argued by the opposing counsel\r\nfrom wholly different standpoints.  The contention of the defence as\r\nstated by counsel was:\r\n\r\n\"We are then in a court.  What are you to try?  You are to try the\r\ncharges contained in these articles of impeachment, and nothing\r\nelse.  Upon what are you to try them?  Not upon common fame; not\r\nupon the price of gold in New York, or upon any question of finance;\r\nnot upon newspaper rumor; not upon any views of party policy;\r\nyou are to try them upon the evidence offered here and nothing\r\nelse, by the obligation of your oaths.\"\r\n\r\nThe contrary contention as stated by one of the managers was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"We define, therefore, an impeachable high crime or misdemeanor,\r\nto be one in its nature or consequences subversive of some fundamental\r\nor essential principle of government, or highly prejudicial to the\r\npublic interest; and this may consist of a violation of the\r\nConstitution, of law, or of duty by an act committed or omitted,\r\nor without violating positive law, by the abuse of discretionary\r\npowers from improper motives, or for any improper purpose.\"\r\n\r\nWith gulf as broad between managers and counsel as that separating\r\nDives and Lazarus, not only as to the issues to be tried, but as\r\nto the nature of the functions and designation of the tribunal\r\nbefore which they were appearing, and with the decision of the\r\nChief Justice upon questions of law arising continually over-ruled\r\nby the majority of the Senators, it may reasonably be supposed that\r\nthere was much in the way of \"travelling out of the record\" in the\r\nheated discussion which followed.\r\n\r\nThe associates of Mr. Evarts--Stanberry, Curtis, Groesbeck, and\r\nNelson--were the most solemn of men, and whatever there was \"bright\r\nwith the radiance of utterance\" to lessen the tension of the\r\nprotracted struggle, came from his own lips.\r\n\r\nNear the close of his speech, Manager Boutwell, in attempting to\r\nindicate the punishment merited by the accused, said:\r\n\r\n\"Travellers and astronomers inform us that in the southern heavens\r\nnear the Southern Cross there is a vast space which the uneducated\r\ncall a hole in the sky, where the eye of man, with the aid of\r\nthe telescope, has been unable to discover nebula, or asteroid,\r\nplanet, comet, star or sun.  In that dreary, cold, dark region\r\nof space, which is only known to be less than infinite by the\r\nevidences of creations elsewhere, the Great Author of celestial\r\nmechanism has left the chaos which was in the beginning.  If\r\nthis earth were capable of the sentiments and emotions of justice and\r\nvirtue which in human mortal beings are the evidences and the pledge\r\nof our divine origin and immortal destiny, it would heave and throw\r\nwith the energy of the elemental forces of nature, and project this\r\nenemy of two races of men into that vast region, there forever\r\nto exist in a solitude eternal as life, or as the absence of life,\r\nemblematical of, it not really, that outer darkness of which the\r\nSaviour of Man spoke in warning to those who are the enemies of\r\nthemselves, of their race, and of their God.\"\r\n\r\nTo the above Mr. Evarts replied:\r\n\r\n\"I may as conveniently at this point of the argument as at any\r\nother pay some attention to the astronomical punishment which\r\nthe learned and honorable manager, Mr. Boutwell, thinks would be\r\napplied to this novel case of impeachment of the President.  Cicero,\r\nI think it is, who says that a lawyer should know everything,\r\nfor sooner or later there is no fact in history, in science, or of\r\nhuman knowledge, that will not come into play in his argument.\r\nPainfully sensible of my ignorance, being devoted to a profession which\r\nsharpens and does not enlarge the mind, I yet can admit without\r\nenvy the superior knowledge evinced by the honorable manager.\r\nIndeed, upon my soul, I believe he is aware of an astronomical fact\r\nof which many professors of that science are wholly ignorant.\r\nNevertheless, while some of his honorable colleagues were paying\r\nattention to an unoccupied and unappropriated island on the surface\r\nof the seas, Mr. Manager Boutwell, more ambitious, had discovered an\r\nuntenanted and unappropriated region in the skies reserved, he\r\nwould have us think, in the final counsels of the Almighty as\r\nthe place of punishment for convicted and deposed American\r\nPresidents.  At first I thought that his mind had become so enlarged\r\nthat it was not sharp enough to discover that the Constitution had\r\nlimited the punishment, but on reflection I saw that he was as\r\nlegal and logical as he was ambitious and astronomical, for the\r\nConstitution has said 'removal from office,' and has put no distance\r\nto the limit of removal, so that it may be, without shedding a drop\r\nof his blood, or taking a penny of his property, or confining\r\nhis limbs, instant removal from office, and transportation to\r\nthe skies.  Truly this is a great undertaking and if the learned\r\nmanager can only get over the obstacles of the laws of nature, the\r\nConstitution will not stand in his way.  He can contrive no method\r\nbut that of a convulsion of the earth, that shall project the\r\ndeposed President to this infinitely distant space; but a shock of\r\nnature of so vast energy and for so great a result on him, might\r\nunsettle even the footing of the firm members of Congress.  We\r\ncertainly need not resort to so perilous a method as that.  How\r\nshall we accomplish it?  Why, in the first place, nobody knows\r\nwhere that space is but the learned manager himself, and _he is\r\nthe necessary deputy to execute the judgment of the court.\"_\r\n\r\nTwo of the managers, Butler and Bingham, were at sword's points,\r\nand had but recently assailed each other with great bitterness\r\nin the House.  How all this was turned to account by the counsel\r\nwill now appear.  In vindicating the President against the charge of\r\nundignified utterances and impropriety of speech in recent\r\npublic addresses, Mr. Evarts candidly admits that the Executive,\r\nwhose early educational advantages had been meagre indeed, and who\r\nwas confessedly untaught of the schools, \"had gotten into trouble by\r\nundertaking to be logical with a metaphor.\"\r\n\r\nHe insisted, however, that the President should be bound by no\r\nhigher standard of propriety of speech than that set by the House of\r\nwhich the Honorable Managers were members.  The rule governing the\r\nHouse in such matters will readily appear from a recent exchange\r\nof courtesies between the two distinguished members referred to\r\nabove, Mr. Bingham and Mr. Butler.  The former said:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to say, Mr. Speaker, that it does not become a gentleman\r\nwho recorded his vote fifty times for Jefferson Davis as his candidate\r\nfor President of the United States, to undertake to damage this\r\ncause by attempting to cast an imputation either upon my integrity\r\nor my honor.  I repel with scorn and contempt any utterance of that\r\nsort from any man, _whether he be the hero of Fort Fisher, not\r\ntaken, or of Fort Fisher, taken!\"_\r\n\r\nTo which Mr. Butler replied:\r\n\r\n\"But if during the war, the gentleman from Ohio did as much as I\r\ndid in that direction, I shall be glad to recognize that much done.\r\nBut the only victim of the gentleman's prowess that I know of was an\r\ninnocent woman on the scaffold, one Mrs. Surratt.  I can sustain\r\nthe memory of Fort Fisher if he and his present associates can\r\nsustain him in shedding the blood of a woman tried by a military\r\ncommission _and convicted, in my judgment, without sufficient\r\nevidence!\"_\r\n\r\nTo which Mr. Bingham replied:  \"I challenge the gentleman, I dare him\r\nanywhere, in this tribunal or any tribunal, to assert that I\r\nspoliated or mutilated any book.  Why, sir, such a charge without one\r\ntittle of evidence is only fit to come from a man _who lives in\r\na bottle, and is fed with a spoon!\"_\r\n\r\n\"Now, what under heavens that means,\" protested Evarts, \"I do\r\nnot know, but it is within the common law of courtesy in the judgment\r\nof the House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\"THE GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI\"\r\n\r\nJOHN ALLEN, MEMBER OF CONGRESS--HE PAYS A COMPLIMENT TO GENERAL\r\nWHEELER--HIS MODEST LUNCH--A SOUTHERNER'S VIEW OF PREDESTINATION\r\n--A SKULKER'S OBJECTION TO BE SHOT BY A \"LOW-DOWN YANKEE\"--JOHN\r\nALLEN'S TILT WITH COLONEL FELLOWS.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this brief sketch is still in life, very much so;\r\nand that he\r\n\r\n  \"Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath\r\n  To time and mortal custom\"\r\n\r\nis the prayer of friends and political foes alike.  Who does not\r\nknow or has not heard of \"Private John Allen,\" the sometime member\r\nof Congress from Mississippi?  A more charming gentleman or delightful\r\ncompanion for the hours of recreation and gladness has rarely\r\nappeared in this old world.  He was, while in his teens, a private\r\nsoldier in the Confederate army, later was a practising lawyer,\r\nand in time \"reluctantly yielding to the earnest solicitations\r\nof his friends,\" generously consented to serve a few terms in\r\nCongress.  From his first entrance into the House, he was well\r\nknown to all its members.  No one needed an introduction--they all\r\nknew John Allen.\r\n\r\nUpon the conclusion of his first speech, which possibly referred\r\nto the improvement of the Tombigbee River, he modestly remarked:\r\n\"Now I am through my speech for this time, Mr. Speaker, _and\r\nwill immediately retire to the cloak-room to receive the congratulations\r\nof my friends.\"_\r\n\r\nSpeaker Reed, with whom he was a great favorite, never failed to\r\n\"recognize\" John, and in fact by common consent he was always\r\nentitled to the floor.  This fact will shed some light upon the\r\nfollowing incident.  During the roll-call of the House upon a motion\r\nto adjourn at a late hour of a night session, Mr. Allen passed down\r\nthe aisle, with hat and overcoat upon his arm, and, stopping\r\nimmediately in front of the Clerk's desk, said \"Mr. Speaker, ----\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose,\" said Reed, \"does the gentleman from Mississippi\r\ninterrupt the roll-call?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker,\" continued Allen, \"I rise to a parliamentary inquiry.\r\nI want to know how General Wheeler voted on this motion.\"  To this\r\n\"parliamentary inquiry\" the Speaker after ascertaining the fact\r\nreplied that the gentleman from Alabama had voted \"aye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Mr. Speaker,\" said John, \"just put me down the same\r\nway with General Wheeler; I followed him four years, and _he never\r\nled me into danger yet.\"_\r\n\r\nSeated one day in the Senate restaurant, I observed Mr. Allen\r\nstanding at the entrance.  Upon my invitation, he took a seat at\r\nmy table.  \"What will you have, John?\" said I.  With an abstracted\r\nair, and the appearance of being extremely embarrassed by his\r\nsurroundings, he replied, \"It makes mighty little difference about\r\nme anyway,\" and turning to a waiter he slowly drawled out, \"Bring me\r\nsome terrapin and champagne.\"  Then, in an apologetic tone he\r\nquietly observed, \"I got used to that durin' the Wah.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's pause, he continued, \"By the way, did you ever\r\nhear the expression 'before the Wah'?\"  I intimated that the\r\nexpression had not wholly escaped me.\r\n\r\n\"I heard it once under rather peculiar circumstances,\" said John.\r\n\"Down in the outskirts of my deestrict, there is an old-time\r\nreligious sect known as the 'hard-shell' or 'iron-jacket' Baptists;\r\nmighty good, honest people, of course, but old-fashioned in their ways\r\nand everlastingly opposed to all new-fangled notions, such as having\r\nTemperance societies, Missionary societies, and Sunday schools.\r\nThey would, however, die in their tracks before they would ever\r\nlet up on the good old church doctrines, especially predestination.\r\nOh, I tell you they were predestinarians from away back.  John\r\nCalvin with his vapory views upon that question would not have been\r\nadmitted even on probation.  Sometimes the preacher during his\r\nsermon, turning to the Amen corner would inquire:  'When were you,\r\nmy brother, predestinated to eternal salvation, or eternal\r\ndamnation?'\r\n\r\n\"Well, the answer that had come down from the ages always was,\r\n'From the foundation of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"When I was making my first race for Congress, I spoke in that\r\nneighborhood one Saturday, and stayed all night with one of the\r\nelders, and on Sunday of course I went to church.  During the\r\nsermon, the preacher while holding forth as usual on his\r\nfavorite doctrine, suddenly turning to a stranger who had somehow got\r\ncrowded into the Amen corner, said:  'My brother, when were you\r\npredestinated to eternal salvation or eternal damnation?'  To which\r\nstartling inquiry the stranger, terribly embarrassed, hesitatingly\r\nanswered:  'I don't adzactly remember, Parson, but _I think it was\r\nbefo' the Wah.'\"_\r\n\r\nA comrade of John in Company G was a tow-headed, lantern-jawed\r\nfellow who never failed somehow to get to the rear and to a place of\r\ncomparative safety at the first intimation of approaching battle.\r\nHe was proof alike against the gibes of his comrades and the threats\r\nof his officers.  Upon one occasion the approach of the enemy\r\nwas heralded by a few shells bursting suggestively near the spot\r\nwhere Company G was stationed.  The tow-headed veteran immediately\r\nbegan preparations to retire.  With threatening mien, levelled\r\nrevolver, and oaths that would have done no discredit to \"our army\r\nin Flanders,\" the Captain ordered the skulker back into line, upon\r\npain of instant death.  Leaning upon his musket, and with familiar\r\ngaze upon his irate superior, the culprit slowly drawled:  \"I don't\r\nmine bein' muddered by a high-tone Southern gentleman like you,\r\nCappen, but dam if I'm gwyen to eternally disgrace my family by\r\nlettin' one of them low-down Yankees shoot me!\"\r\n\r\nAllen was no exception to the rule that men gifted like himself\r\nare subject to occasional seasons of gloom, but his greeting usually\r\ncame as a benediction.  At the banquet table, when dull care was\r\nlaid aside and he was surrounded by genial companions,--\"for\r\n'tis meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes\"--his star\r\nwas at its zenith.  Then indeed, all rules were suspended; no point\r\nof order suggested--\"The man and the hour had met.\"  His marvellous\r\nnarratives of quaint incidents and startling experiences, his\r\nbrilliant repartee, sallies of wit, banter, and badinage have rarely\r\nbeen heard since the days of the Round Table or the passing of \"the\r\nStar and Garter.\"\r\n\r\nOnce, however, John Allen confessedly met his match in the person of\r\nthe Hon. John R. Fellows, who had been Colonel of an Arkansas\r\nregiment in the Confederate service; later a prominent leader of\r\nTammany Hall, and was at the time mentioned, a Representative in\r\nCongress from New York.  He was the \"Prince Rupert of Debate,\" and\r\nwas gifted with eloquence rarely equalled.  At a banquet given\r\nin his honor upon his retirement from Congress, a hundred or more of\r\nhis associates were guests, including, of course, the subject of\r\nthis sketch.  Men high in councils of State, leaders of both parties,\r\nand of both Houses, had gathered around the board, and good-fellowship\r\nand mirth reached the high-water mark.  By common consent Fellows and\r\nAllen were in undisputed possession of the floor.  Such passages-at-arms\r\nno pen can describe.  Even \"John Chamberlain's\" in its palmiest days\r\nhas never known the like.\r\n\r\nNear the close Allen said:\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing I would like to have Colonel Fellows explain.\r\nHe was captured the first year of the war, and never exchanged,\r\nbut held as a prisoner by the Federals until the war was over.\r\nI was taken prisoner five times, and always promptly exchanged.\r\nI would like Colonel Fellows to explain how it was that he was kept\r\nin a place of safety, while I was always at the front?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the applause which followed had subsided, Colonel Fellows\r\narose and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful to my friend from Mississippi for giving me an\r\nopportunity to explain that part of my military record which I\r\napprehend has never been sufficiently clear.  It is true.  I was\r\ntaken prisoner the first year of the war, and the enemy, well\r\nknowing the danger of my being at large, persistently refused to\r\nrelease me until peace was restored.  Had I been promptly exchanged,\r\n_the result of that war might have been different!_  But why it\r\nwas, that my friend from Mississippi was so repeatedly and promptly\r\nexchanged is a question that until yesterday I have never been able\r\nto understand.  It has given me deep concern.  I have pondered over\r\nit during the silent watches of the night.  Yesterday, however, my\r\nmind was completely set at rest upon that question by reading\r\nthe correspondence--to be found in Volume 748, page 421 of the\r\n'Record of the War of the Rebellion'--between President Lincoln\r\nand President Davis relating to the exchange of Private John Allen\r\nof Company G, Fourteenth Mississippi Volunteers.  The correspondence\r\ncovers many pages of this valuable publication, but I will read\r\nonly the closing communication.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while John with a new supply of terrapin before him was listening\r\nintently, Fellows carefully adjusting his eye-glasses and taking\r\na letter from his pocket, continued:\r\n\r\n\"The letter I will read from President Lincoln concluded the\r\ncorrespondence, and is as follows:  _'Dear Jeff:_  With this I\r\nreturn you Private John Allen of Company G, Fourteenth Mississippi.\r\nI require no prisoner in exchange.  The Lord's truth is, Jeff,\r\n_I had rather fight John than feed him!'\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\nAN OLD-TIME COUNTRY DOCTOR\r\n\r\nTHE WRITER AT HIS INN, THE TRAVELLER'S HOME--DOCTOR JOHN, ONE OF\r\nHIS EARLIEST ACQUAINTANCES--THE DOCTOR'S LIBERALITY IN ADMINISTERING\r\nMEDICINE--A DISAPPOINTMENT IN EARLY LIFE--THE DOCTOR'S IGNORANCE OF\r\nTHE \"SOLAR SYSTEM\"--A DIFFICULTY WITH THE LANDLADY--A QUESTION\r\nOF ORTHOGRAPHY--THE DOCTOR AS A MEMBER OF A TOTAL-ABSTINENCE\r\nSOCIETY.\r\n\r\nUpon my admission to the bar in 1858, I located at Metamora, a\r\nvillage of five hundred inhabitants, about forty miles northwest\r\nof Bloomington.  It was beautifully and _quietly_ situated,\r\neight miles from the railroad, and was at the time the county-seat\r\nof Woodford County, one of the finest agricultural portions of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nMetamora contained many delightful families, and a cordial welcome\r\nwas accorded me.  The old tavern, \"Traveller's Home,\" was mine inn,\r\nand as a hostelry it possessed rare advantages.  The one that\r\nchiefly recommended it to me was its extremely moderate charges.\r\nTwo dollars and a half per week for board and lodging, \"washing\r\nand mending\" included, were the inviting terms held out to all\r\ncomers and goers.  There was much, however, in the surroundings,\r\nappointments, etc., of this ancient inn, little calculated to\r\nreconcile delicately toned mortals to things of sense.  It was\r\nof this place of entertainment that Colonel Ingersoll spoke when, in\r\nhis description of the tapestry of Windsor Castle, he said that it\r\nreminded him of a Metamora table-cloth _the second week of court._\r\n\r\nThe dear old tavern has fallen a victim to the remorseless tooth\r\nof time, but, in the palmy days of Metamora, when it was the\r\ncounty-seat, and the Spring and Fall terms of court were as regular\r\nin their coming as the seasons themselves, the old tavern was in\r\nits glory, and for all \"transients\" and \"regulars\" it was the chief\r\nobjective point.  For a decade or more its walls gave shelter to\r\nJudge Treat, Judge Davis, Mr. Lincoln, General Gridley, Judge\r\nPurple, and more than once to General Shields and Stephen A. Douglas.\r\nAt a later date it was upon like occasion the stopping place of\r\nColonel Ingersoll, John Burns, Judge Shaw, James S. Ewing, Robert E.\r\nWilliams, Judge Richmond, and other well-known members of the bar.\r\n\r\nOne of my earliest acquaintances in Metamora, and one not soon\r\nto be forgotten, was Doctor John--familiarly called \"Doc,\" except upon\r\nstate occasions.  As I write, the vision of the Doctor arises before\r\nme out of the mists of the shadowy past.  His personal appearance was\r\nindeed remarkable.  Standing six feet six in his number elevens,\r\nwithout an ounce of superfluous flesh, a neck somewhat elongated\r\nand set off to great advantage by an immense \"Adam's apple,\" which\r\nappeared to be constantly on duty, head large and features a trifle\r\nexaggerated, and with iron gray locks hanging gracefully over\r\nhis slightly stooped shoulders, the Doctor would have given pause to\r\nthe McGregor, even with foot upon his native heather.  He first\r\nsaw the light of day in the \"Panhandle\" of the Old Dominion; the\r\npart thereof afterwards detached for the formation of the new State.\r\nHow this all came about was to the Doctor as inexplicable as the\r\nriddle of the Sphinx; but he scouted the thought that he had\r\never ceased to be a son of \"the real old Virginny.\"  He claimed to\r\nbe a descendant of one of \"the first families,\" and there lingered\r\nabout him in very truth much of the chivalric bearing of the old\r\ncavalier stock.  No man living could possibly have invited a\r\ngentleman \"to partake of some spirits\" or \"to participate in a\r\nglass of beer,\" in a loftier manner than did the Doctor.  Not\r\nhimself a member of the visible church, nor even an occasional\r\nattendant upon its service, the heart of the Doctor nevertheless,\r\nlike that of the renowned Cave Burton, responded feelingly to every\r\nearnest supplication \"for the preservation of the kindly fruits of\r\nthe earth to be enjoyed in due season.\"  And with the Doctor, as\r\nwith Cave, the question of the _quantity_ of the kindly fruits thus\r\npreserved was of far greater moment than any mere matter of sentiment\r\nas to their _quality._\r\n\r\nThe intellectual attainments of the Doctor, it must be admitted,\r\nwere not of the highest order.  He was a student of men rather than\r\nof books.  He had journeyed but little along the flowery paths\r\nof literature.  He never gave \"local habitation or name\" to the\r\nparticular Medical College which had honored him with its degree.\r\nHe was, as he often asserted, of the \"epleptic\" school of medicine.\r\nIn reply to my inquiry as to what that really was, he solemnly\r\nasservated that it was the only school which permitted its\r\npractitioners to accept all that was good, and reject all that was\r\nbad, of all the other schools.  In his practice he had a supreme\r\ncontempt for what he called \"written proscriptions,\" and often\r\nboasted that he never allowed one of them to go out of his office.\r\nHe infinitely preferred to compound his own medicines, which, with\r\nthe aid of mortar and pestle, he did in unstinted measure in his\r\noffice.  On rainy days and during extremely healthy seasons, his\r\nstock was thereby largely augmented.  In administering his \"doses\"\r\nhis generous spirit manifested itself as clearly as along other\r\nlines.  No \"pent-up Utica\" contracted his powers.  It has been many\r\ntimes asserted, and with apparent confidence, that no patient of\r\nhis ever complained of not having received full measure.  There were\r\nno Oliver Twists among his patients.  It was a singular fact in\r\nall the professional experience of this eminent practitioner, that\r\nhis patients, regardless of age or sex, were all afflicted with\r\na like malady.  Many a time as he returned from a professional\r\nvisit, mounted on his old roan, with his bushel measure medicine\r\nbag thrown across his saddle, in answer to my casual inquiry as to\r\nthe ailment of his patient, he gave in oracular tones, the one\r\nall-sufficient reply, _\"only a slight derangement of the nervous\r\nsystem.\"_\r\n\r\nHe never quite forgave Mr. Lincoln the reply he once made to an\r\nill-advised interruption of the Doctor during a political speech.\r\n\"Well, well, Doctor,\" replied Mr. Lincoln, good-humoredly, \"I will\r\ntake anything from you _except your medicines.\"_\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was a bachelor, and his \"May of life\" had fallen into\r\nthe sear and yellow leaf at the time of which we write.  He was\r\nstill, however, as he more than once assured me, an ardent admirer\r\nof \"the opposing sect.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of his most confidential moods, he disclosed to me the\r\nstartling fact that he had in early life been the victim of a\r\nmisplaced confidence.  In an unguarded moment he entrusted the idol\r\nof his heart to the safe keeping of a friend, in the whiteness\r\nof whose soul he trusted as in a mother's love, while he, the\r\nconfiding Doctor, journeyed westward to seek a home.\r\n\r\n  \"He knew not the doctrine of ill-doing,\r\n  Nor dreamed that any did.\"\r\n\r\nAlas for human frailty, \"the badge of all our race.\"  Upon his\r\nreturn after an absence of several moons, he found to his unspeakable\r\ndismay that that same \"friend\" had taken to wife the idol whose\r\nimage had so long found lodgment in the Doctor's own sad heart.\r\nToo late he realized, as wiser men have done before and since, that\r\n\r\n  \"Friendship is constant in all other things\r\n  Save in the office and affairs of love.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was much given at times to what he denominated \"low down\r\ntalks\" such as are wont when kindred souls hold close converse.\r\nSeated in my office on one occasion, at the hour when churchyards yawn,\r\nand being as he candidly admitted in a somewhat \"reminiscent\" mood,\r\nhe unwittingly gave expression to thoughts beyond the reaches of\r\nour souls, when I made earnest inquiry, \"Doctor, what in your\r\njudgment as a medical man is to be the final destination of the\r\nhuman soul?\"  The solemn hour of midnight, together with the no\r\nless solemn inquiry, at once plunged the Doctor into deep thought.\r\nFirst carefully changing his quid from the right to the left jaw, he\r\nslowly and as if thoughtfully measuring his words, replied:  \"Brother\r\nStevenson, _the solar system are one of which I have given very\r\nlittle reflection.\"_\r\n\r\nIt is a sad fact that in this world the best of men are not wholly\r\nexempt from human frailties.  Even in the noble calling of medicine\r\nthere have been at times slight outcroppings of a spirit of\r\nprofessional jealousy.  That the subject of these brief chronicles\r\nwas no exception to this infirmity will appear from a remark he\r\nonce made in regard to a professional contemporary whose practice had\r\ngradually encroached upon the Doctor's beat.  Said he:  \"They talk a\r\ngood deal about this Doc Wilson's practice; but I'll 'low that\r\nmy books will show a greater degree of mortality than what hisn\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was one of the regular boarders at the historic inn\r\nalready mentioned.  By long and faithful service he had won the\r\nhonored position of chief boarder, and his place by common consent\r\nwas at the head of the table.  No one who ever sat at that delightful\r\nboard could forget the dignified manner in which the Doctor would take\r\nhis accustomed seat, and without unnecessary delay proceed to\r\nappropriate whatever viands might be within his reach.  As a matter\r\nof especial grace upon the part of the good landlady, an\r\nold-fashioned corn pone and a pitcher of sweet milk appeared\r\noccasionally upon the supper table of this most excellent inn.  Such\r\nvisitations were truly regarded, even by the veterans, as very\r\noases in the desert of life.  Now, it so happened, that upon a cold\r\nDecember evening, between the first and second tolling of the supper\r\nbell, the boarders in anxious expectancy were awaiting the final\r\nsummons, in a small chamber hard by the dining-room.  To this\r\nassembly the writer hereof remarked:  \"It seems to me, gentlemen, that\r\nit has been a long time since we have been favored with pone bread\r\nand sweet milk.  I therefore move that Doctor John be appointed\r\na committee of one to request Mrs. Sparks to have these delicacies\r\nfor supper to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nA hearty second was immediately given by Whig Ewing, Esq., at a\r\nlater day distinguished both as an orator and a Judge.  Without\r\nshadow of opposition the resolution was adopted, and upon summons the\r\nboarders were almost immediately thereafter in their accustomed\r\nplaces at the table.  Turning to the landlady as she slowly approached\r\nwith a platter of cold biscuits, the Doctor in most conciliatory\r\ntones said:  \"Mrs. Sparks, at a regular meeting of the borders held\r\nthis evening I was appointed a committee of one to invite you to\r\nhave corn pone and sweet milk to-morrow evening.\"  A deep frown at\r\nonce encircled the fair brow of our hostess.  Unlike that of the\r\nlate Mrs. Tam O'Shanter, her wrath needed no nursing to keep it\r\nwarm.  Advancing a step, and with apparent effort suppressing\r\nher emotion, she slowly articulated _\"What did you say, Doctor?\"_\r\nPresaging danger in the very air, the Doctor repeated in husky\r\ntones, \"At a regular meeting of the boarders held this evening,\r\nI was appointed a committee of one to invite you to have corn bread\r\nfor supper to-morrow evening.\"  At the repetition the frown upon\r\nthe brow of the fair one darkened and deepened.  Advancing a\r\nstep nearer the object of her wrath, she said, \"If _you_ or any of\r\nthe _other_ boarders are dissatisfied with my house, you can leave,\r\n_and leave now!\"_\r\n\r\nWith the thermometer at zero and Peoria seventeen miles away,\r\nand the Illinois out of its banks, there was little that was\r\ncomforting in her words.  The stillness of the grave was upon that\r\nlittle assembly.  At length, to relieve the strain of the situation,\r\nif possible, the writer inquired, \"What was your remark, Doctor\r\nJohn?\" to which the Doctor, in a tome somewhat hopeful but by no\r\nmeans confident, replied, \"I was just remarking to our beloved\r\nlandlady, brother Stevenson, that at a regular meeting of the\r\nboarders held this evening I was appointed a committee to invite\r\nher to have corn bread for supper to-morrow night.\"  To which I\r\nmodestly replied, \"Well, if any such meeting as that was ever held,\r\n_it is very strange that I heard nothing about it.\"_  This kindly\r\nobservation only deepened the gloom, and perceptibly lessened the\r\ndistance between the irate hostess and the chief boarder.  The\r\nlatter in sheer desperation at length appealed for succor to Ewing,\r\nwho until this moment, strangely enough, had been an attentive\r\nlistener.  Thus appealed to, the latter, with Prince Albert buttoned\r\nto the very top, and with the statesman's true pose, said:\r\n\r\n\"I beg to assure you, Mrs. Sparks, that I am profoundly ignorant\r\nof any such meeting of the boarders as has been indicated.  Had\r\nI been apprised that such meeting was contemplated I would have\r\nattended and used by utmost endeavor to secure the defeat of its\r\nill-timed resolution.  Let me say further, madam, that I am not\r\nfond of corn bread.  The biscuits with which we are nourished from\r\nday to day are exactly to my taste, and even if they were a few\r\ndegrees colder I would cherish them still the more fondly.  In the\r\nyears gone by, madam, I have been a guest at the Astor, the Galt, the\r\nSt. Charles, and at the best hotels in London and upon the continent\r\nof Europe.  None of them in my humble judgment are comparable to\r\nthis.  I assure you solemnly, madam, that I have lingered in\r\nthis village month after month only because of my reluctance to\r\ntear myself away from your most excellent hotel.\"\r\n\r\nWith finger raised, step advanced, and eye fixed uncharitably upon\r\nthe offending physician, the gentle hostess in voice little above a\r\nwhisper, said, _\"Doc, I think you made that up out of whole cloth.\"_\r\nThe crisis was reached; flesh and blood could endure no more.  The\r\nDoctor rose, and waiving all formalities and farewells, \"stood not\r\nupon the order of his going.\"\r\n\r\nFor reasons unnecessary to explain, I did not seek the Doctor that\r\nevening nor the following day.  Morning and noon came and went,\r\nbut the chief boarder did not appear.  The vacant chair was to\r\nthose who lingered a pathetic reminder of the sad departure.  When,\r\nupon the following evening, the surviving boarders gathered to\r\ntheir accustomed places, they beheld in wonderment a splendid pone,\r\nsavory and hot, flanked upon its left by the old yellow pitcher\r\nfilled to its brim with rich, sweet milk.\r\n\r\nA moment later, and all eyes were turned to the open door through which\r\na once familiar figure moved to his seat.  Suddenly stretching both\r\narms to the middle of the table, with one hand the good Doctor\r\ngrasped the pone, and with the other the pitcher, and holding both\r\naloft as he gazed upon each boarder in turn, exclaimed, \"I understand\r\nthe boarders are not fond of corn bread.\"  In the twinkling of\r\nan eye, the Doctor, _the pitcher, the pone had all disappeared from\r\nthe dining-room,_ and the latter two were ne'er heard of more.\r\nThe poetic justice of the situation, however, was so complete, that\r\nno word of complaint was ever uttered.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after the events last narrated, I heard the sound of\r\nmany voices accompanied by peals of laughter coming from the office\r\nof Doctor John.  Stopping at his door, I soon learned that the\r\ntumult was occasioned by a discussion as to whether the Doctor\r\ncould spell \"sugar\" correctly.  The faction adverse to the physician\r\nwas led by one William Hawkins, a country schoolmaster.  The latter\r\nand his allies bantered and badgered the old Doctor to their hearts'\r\ncontent.  Rendered desperate at length by their merciless gibes,\r\nthe Doctor, taking from his vest pocket a five-dollar bill--one\r\nI had loaned him an hour before with which to pay a couple of weeks'\r\nboards--he offered to bet the full amount that he could spell\r\nthe word correctly.  A like amount being at length raised by the\r\nadverse faction, the question at once arose as to who should be\r\nthe arbiter.  Observing me for the first time as I stood at the\r\ndoor, the Doctor declared his willingness to accept me as \"empire.\"\r\nIt may here be remarked that the honorable office to which I was\r\nthus nominated is sometimes called \"umpire.\"  Webster, Worcester, and\r\npossibly other lexicographers give the latter pronunciation the\r\npreference.  But the Doctor being \"an old settler\" and much better\r\nacquainted in that locality than either of the other authorities, his\r\npreference will be recognized, and \"empire\" it will be to the end of\r\nthis chapter.  At all events my nomination--for the first and only\r\ntime--was unanimously concurred in.  Stepping at once into the\r\noffice and confronting the leaders of the opposing faction, I stated\r\ncandidly that while I highly appreciated the distinction tendered,\r\nstill I was unwilling to accept the responsible position of \"empire\"\r\nsave upon the explicit agreement that, _whatever the decision,_\r\nthere should be no complaint or grumbling upon the part of the\r\ndisaffected or disgruntled hereafter; that \"empires\" after all were\r\nonly men and liable to the mistakes and errors incident to our poor\r\nhumanity.  To the end, therefore, that an \"empire\" act with proper\r\nindependence, it was all important that his decision pass unchallenged.\r\nThese reasonable requirement being readily acquiesced in, the office\r\nwas accepted and the money hazarded by each faction carefully\r\ndeposited in the \"empire's\" vest pocket.  The arbiter now solemnly\r\naddressing the principal actor said:  \"Doctor, the word is, 'sugar';\r\n_proceed to spell.\"_\r\n\r\nThe Doctor immediately stood up.  The psychological question, if\r\nit be such, is here presented whether _standing_ is the more eligible\r\nposition for the severe mental effort indicated above.  Waiving\r\nall discussion upon this interesting point, the fact is here\r\nfaithfully chronicled that the Doctor stood up.  Looking neither\r\nto the right nor to the left, but standing majestically in the\r\nmiddle of the room, and presenting in some of its characteristics the\r\nbeauty and symmetry of an inverted L, the Doctor began, \"S-h-o-o-g\r\n----\" whereupon the little schoolmaster burst into loud laughing.\r\nSolemnly warning him against the repetition of such conduct, the\r\narbiter reminded him that such manifestations in the very presence\r\nof the \"empire,\" were in some countries punished with immediate\r\ndeath, and again significantly warned him against its recurrence.\r\nAt the same time the Doctor was reminded that he had not yet\r\ncompleted the spelling of the word.  The Doctor replied, \"If it is\r\nall the same to you, Mr. Empire, I believe I will begin all over\r\nagain.\"  Permission being granted, the spelling was resumed:\r\n\"S-h-o-o-g-o-r.\"  To this the arbiter responded, \"You have spelled\r\nthe word correctly, Doctor,\" and  _immediately handed him the\r\nstakes._\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting events occurring during my residence in\r\nMetamora, was a noted temperance revival under the auspices of \"the\r\nGrand Worthy Deputy\" of a well-known temperance organization.  A\r\nlodge was duly organized, and a profound interest aroused in the\r\ngood work.  During the visit of the excellent lady who bore with\r\nbecoming modesty the somewhat formidable title above given, the\r\ninterest deepened, meetings were of nightly occurrence, and\r\nlarge numbers were gathered into the fold.  For many days ordinary\r\npursuits were suspended, and the grand cause was the only and\r\nall-absorbing topic of conversation.\r\n\r\nChief among the initiated was our old friend Doctor John.  His\r\nconversion created a profound sensation, and it veritably seemed\r\nfor a time as though a permanent breach had been effected in the\r\nramparts of Satan.  It was even boasted that the Presbyterian\r\nclergyman, one saloon keeper, and the writer of these truthful\r\nannals were, as Judge Tipton would say, \"substantially\" the only\r\nadherents remaining to His Satanic Majesty.  The pressure was,\r\nhowever, soon irresistible, and the writer, deserting his sometime\r\nassociates, at length passed over to the _un_silent majority.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was the bearer of my petition, and in due time and as\r\nthe sequel will show, for only a short time, I was in good and\r\nregular standing.  As explanatory of the sudden termination of what\r\nmight under happier auspices have proved an eminently useful career,\r\nit may be casually mentioned that upon the writer's first introduction\r\ninto the lodge, in answer to the official inquiry solemnly propounded,\r\n\"Why do you seek admission into our honorable order?\" he unwittingly\r\nreplied, _\"Because Doctor John joined.\"_\r\n\r\nThis was for the moment permitted to pass, and the exercises of\r\nthe session reached the high-water mark of entertainment.  At some\r\ntime during the evening, by way of \"exemplifying the work,\" Doctor\r\nJohn had for the second time taken the solemn vow henceforth and\r\nforever to abstain from the use of all fluids of alcoholic, vinous,\r\nor fermented character.\r\n\r\nThe hour for separation at length drew nigh.  Thus far all had gone\r\nmerry as a marriage bell.  All signs betokened fair weather.\r\nBarring the temporary commotion occasioned by the uncanonical reply\r\nof the writer above given, not a ripple had appeared upon the\r\nsurface.  It was at length announced that this was the last evening\r\nthat the Grand Worthy Deputy could be with us, as she was to leave\r\nfor her distant home by the stage coach in the early morning.\r\nSplendidly set off in her great robes of office, her farewell words\r\nof instruction, encouragement, and admonition, were then most\r\ntenderly spoken.  Before pronouncing the final farewell--\"that word\r\nwhich makes us linger\"--she calmly remarked that this would be her\r\nlast opportunity to expound any constitutional question that might\r\nhereafter arise pertaining to the well-being of the order, and that\r\nshe would gladly answer any inquiry that any brother or sister\r\nabout the lodge might propose.  Her seat was then resumed, and\r\nsilence for the time reigned supreme.  At length, amid stillness\r\nthat could no longer be endured, she arose and advancing to the\r\nfront of the platform, repeated, in manner more solemn than before,\r\nthe invitation above given.  Still there was no response.  It\r\nall seemed formidable and afar off.  In the hope that he might\r\nin some measure dispel the embarrassment, the unworthy chronicler of\r\nthese important events, from his humble place in the northwest\r\ncorner of the lodge, for the first and last time addressed the\r\nchair.  Permission being graciously given him to proceed, he candidly\r\nadmitted that he had no constitutional question himself to propound,\r\nbut that Brother John was in grave doubt touching a question\r\nupon which he would be glad to have the opinion of the chair.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" continued the speaker, \"from the nature of the\r\npledge that if any brother, or sister even for that matter, should\r\npartake of liquors alcoholic, vinous, or fermented, he or she would\r\nbe liable to expulsion from the order.  Am I correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is certainly correct, Brother Stevenson,\" was the prompt\r\nreply in no uncertain tone.\r\n\r\n\"I so understand it,\" continued the speaker, \"and so does Brother John.\r\nWhat he seeks to know is this:  If in an unguarded moment he should\r\nhearken to the voice of the tempter, and so far forget his solemn vows\r\nas to partake of alcoholic, vinous, or fermented liquors, and be\r\nexpelled therefor, would he thereby be wholly beyond the pale of\r\nthe lodge, or would he _by virtue of his second obligation taken\r\nthis night,_ have another chance, and still retain his membership in\r\nthe order?\"\r\n\r\nThe official answer, in tone no less uncertain than before, was\r\ninstantly given.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, if Brother John _or you either,_ should drink one drop\r\nof the liquors mentioned and be expelled therefor, you would both be\r\nhelplessly beyond the pale of the lodge, even though you had _both\r\ntaken the obligation a thousand times!\"_\r\n\r\nAs the ominous applause which followed died away, Brother John,\r\nhalf arising in his seat, vehemently exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Worshipful Master, _I never told him to ask no such damn fool\r\nquestion!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\nA QUESTION OF AVAILABILITY\r\n\r\nA POLITICAL BANQUET IN ATLANTA, GA.--GENERAL GORDON PROPOSED\r\n\"THE DEMOCRACY OF ILLINOIS\"--THE WRITER'S RESPONSE--A DESIRE IN\r\nILLINOIS TO NOMINATE THE HON. DAVID DAVIS FOR PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nAbout the year of grace 1889, a number of distinguished statesmen were\r\ninvited to attend a political banquet to be given by the local\r\nDemocratic Association of the splendid city of Atlanta, Georgia.\r\nAmong the guests were Representative Flower of New York and General\r\nCollins of Massachusetts; the chief guest of the occasion was the\r\nHon. David B. Hill, then the Governor of New York.  The banquet\r\nwas under the immediate auspices of the lamented Gordon, and of\r\nGrady of glorious memory.  The board literally groaned under the\r\nrarest viands, and Southern hospitality was at its zenith.  It was,\r\nall in all, an occasion to live in memory.  I was not one of the\r\ninvited guests of the committee, but being in a neighboring city\r\nwas invited by Mr. Grady to be present.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the feast, a toast was proposed to \"The Gallant\r\nDemocracy of New York.\"  Glasses were touched and the enthusiasm\r\nwas unbounded.  The toast was of course responded to by the\r\ndistinguished Governor of the Empire State.  He was at his best.\r\nHis speech, splendid in thought and diction, was heard with\r\nbreathless interest.\r\n\r\nThe keynote was struck, and speech after speech followed in the\r\nproper vein.  There was no discordant note, the burden of every\r\nspeech being the gallant Democracy and splendid statesmanship of\r\nthe great State of New York.\r\n\r\nWhen the distinguished guests had all spoken, the master of\r\nceremonies, General Gordon, proposed a toast to \"The Democracy\r\nof Illinois,\" and called upon me to respond.  I confessed that I\r\nwas only an average Democrat from Illinois; that way out there\r\nwe were content to be of the rank and file, and of course to follow\r\nthe splendid leadership and the gallant Democracy of which we\r\nhad heard so much.  To vote for a New York candidate had by long\r\nusage become a fixed habit with us, in fact, we would hardly know how\r\nto go about voting for a candidate from any other State; and I then\r\nrelated an incident on the question of supporting the ticket, which\r\nI thought might be to the point.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, in the portion of Illinois in which I live, there was\r\nan earnest desire on the part of conservative Democrats and liberal\r\nRepublicans, to elect the Hon. David Davis to the Presidency.\r\nHe had been a Whig in early life, brought up in the school of\r\nWebster and Clay, and was later the devoted personal and political\r\nfriend of Mr. Lincoln.  An earnest Union man during the war, he\r\nhad at its close favored the prompt restoration to the Southern\r\npeople of all their rights under the Constitution.  As a judge\r\nof the Supreme Court, he had rendered a decision in which human\r\nlife was involved, in which he had declared the supremacy of the\r\nFederal Constitution _in war as well as in peace._  Believing that\r\nhe would prove an acceptable candidate, I had gladly joined the\r\nmovement to secure his nomination at the now historic convention\r\nwhich met at Cincinnati in May, 1872.  For many weeks prior to the\r\nmeeting of that convention, there was little talked of in\r\ncentral Illinois but the nomination of Judge Davis for President.\r\nMorning, noon, and night, \"Davis, Davis, Davis,\" was the burden of\r\nour song.\r\n\r\nHe did not, as is well known, receive the nomination, that honor, of\r\ncourse, passing to a distinguished Democratic statesman of New York.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days before I was to leave my home for the Cincinnati\r\nconvention, an old Democratic friend from an adjoining county came\r\ninto my office.  He was an old-timer in very truth.  He was born\r\nin Tennessee, had when a mere boy fought under Jackson at Talladega,\r\nTallapoosa, and New Orleans, had voted for him three times for\r\nthe Presidency, and expected to join him when he died.  He had\r\nlived in Illinois since the \"big snow,\" and his party loyalty was\r\na proverb.\r\n\r\nAs I shook hands with him when he came into my office, he laid\r\naside his saddle-bags, stood his rifle in the corner, took off his\r\nblanket overcoat, and seating himself by the fire, inquired how my\r\n\"folks\" all were.  The answer being satisfactory, and the fact\r\nascertained by me that his own \"folks\" were well, he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stevenson, who are you fur fur President?\"\r\n\r\nUnhesitatingly and earnestly I replied, \"Davis.\"\r\n\r\nA shade, as of disappointment, appeared for a moment upon his\r\ncountenance, but instantly recovering himself, he said, \"Well,\r\nif they nominate him, we will give him the usual majority in our\r\nprecinct, but don't you think, Mr. Stevenson, _it is a leetle airly\r\nto bring old Jeff out?\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\nA STATESMAN OF A PAST ERA\r\n\r\nZEBULON B. VANCE, THE IDOLIZED GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA--HIS\r\nLEARNING AND HIS HUMOR--HE RECALLS MEN AND MATTERS OF THE OLDEN\r\nTIME--HE SUITS HIS CREED TO HIS AUDIENCE--HIS SPEECH IN FAVOR OF\r\nHORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nA name to conjure with in the old North State is Zeb Vance.  What Lee\r\nwas to Virginia, Hendricks to Indiana, Clay to Kentucky, and Lincoln\r\nto Illinois, Zebulon B. Vance was for a lifetime to North Carolina.\r\nHe was seldom spoken of as Governor, or Senator, but alike in piny\r\nwoods and in the mountains, he was familiarly called \"Zeb Vance.\"\r\nHe was the idol of all classes and conditions.  A decade has\r\ngone since he passed to the grave, but his memory is still green.\r\nA grateful people have erected a monument to commemorate his public\r\nservices, while from the French Broad to the Atlantic, alike in\r\nhumble cabin and stately home, his name is a household word.\r\n\r\n  \"He had kept the whiteness of his soul,\r\n  And thus men o'er him wept.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression \"rare,\" as given to Ben Jonson, might with equal\r\npropriety be applied to Senator Vance.  Deeply read in classic\r\nlore, a profound lawyer, and an indefatigable student from the\r\nbeginning in all that pertained to human government, he was the\r\nfit associate of the most cultured in the drawing-room or the\r\nSenate.  None the less, with the homely topics of everyday life\r\nfor discussion, he was equally at home, and ever a welcome guest\r\nat the hearthstone of the humblest dweller in pine forest and\r\nmountain glen of his native State.\r\n\r\nOf all the men I have ever known, Vance was _par excellence_ the\r\npossessor of the wondrous gift of humor.  It was ingrained; literally\r\na part of his very being.  He once told me that he thought his fame\r\nfor one generation, at least, was secure, inasmuch as one-half\r\nof the freckled-faced boys and two-thirds of the \"yaller\" dogs\r\nin North Carolina had been named in his honor.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion in the Senate, a bill he had introduced was\r\nbitterly antagonized by a member who took occasion in his speech, while\r\nquestioning the sincerity of Vance, to extol his own honesty of\r\npurpose.  In replying to the vaunt of superior honesty by his\r\nopponent, Vance quoted the old Southland doggerel:\r\n\r\n  \"De darky in de ole camp ground\r\n  Dat loudest sing and shout\r\n  Am gwine to rob a hen-roost\r\n  Befo' de week am out.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer home of Senator Vance during the later years of his life\r\nwas in his native county of Buncombe, about twenty miles from\r\nAsheville, where for some days I was his guest, many years ago.\r\nLeaving the cars at the nearest station and following the trail\r\nfor a dozen miles, I found the Senator snugly ensconced in his\r\ncomfortable home at the top of the mountain.  He was alone, his\r\nfamily being \"down in the settlements,\" as he told me.  An old\r\nnegro man _to whom Vance once belonged,_ as he assured me, was\r\nhousekeeper, cook, and butler, besides being the incumbent of\r\nvarious other offices of usefulness and dignity.\r\n\r\nThe first inquiry from Vance as, drenched with rain, I entered his\r\nabode and approached a blazing fire, was, \"Are you _dry?\"_  It\r\nwould only gratify an idle curiosity to tell how the first moments\r\nof this memorable visit passed.  Suffice it to say that old-time\r\nSouthern hospitality was at its best, and so continued till the\r\nmorning of the fifth day, when I descended in company with my host\r\nto the accustomed haunts of busy men.\r\n\r\nThe days and evenings passed with Vance at the cheerful fireside\r\nof his mountain home still live in my memory.  He literally \"unfolded\r\nhimself,\" and it was indeed worth while to listen to his description\r\nof the quaint times and customs with which he was familiar in\r\nthe long ago, to hear of the men he had known and of the stormy\r\nevents of which he had been a part.\r\n\r\nHis public life reached back to a time anterior to the war.  He\r\nwas in Congress when its Representatives assembled in the Old Hall,\r\nnow the \"Valhalla\" of the nation.  Events once of deep significance\r\nwere recalled from the mists of a long past; men who had strutted their\r\nbrief hour upon the stage and then gone out with the tide were made\r\nto live again.  Incidents once fraught with deep consequence but\r\nnow relegated to the by-paths of history, were again in visible\r\npresence, as if touched by the enchanter's wand.\r\n\r\nThe scenes, of which he was the sad and silent witness, attendant upon\r\nthe withdrawal of his colleagues and associates from both chambers\r\nof the Capitol, and the appeal to the sword--precursors of the\r\nchapter of blood yet to be written--were never more graphically\r\ndepicted by mortal tongue.\r\n\r\nI distinctly recall, even at this lapse of time, some of the\r\nincidents he related.  When first he was a candidate for Congress,\r\nfar back in the fifties, his district embraced a large portion\r\nof the territory of the entire western part of his State.  Fully\r\nto appreciate what follows, it must be remembered that at that time\r\nthere was in the backwoods country, and in the out-of-the-way\r\nplaces, far off from the great highways, much of antagonism between\r\nthe various religious denominations.  At times much of the sermons\r\nof the rural preachers consisted of denunciations of other churches.\r\nBy a perusal of the autobiography of the Rev. Peter Cartwright, it\r\nwill be seen that western North Carolina was only in line with\r\nother portions of the great moral vineyard.  The doctrines peculiar\r\nto the particular denomination were preached generally with\r\ngreat earnestness and power.  \"Blest be the tie that binds our\r\nhearts in Christian love,\" was too seldom heard in the rural\r\ncongregations.  In too many, indeed, Christian charity, even in\r\na modified form, was an unknown quantity.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions mentioned, to say that seekers of public place\r\nobeyed the Apostolic injunction to be \"all things to all men\" is\r\nonly to say that they were--_candidates._\r\n\r\nIt so fell out that our candidate for Congress at the time mentioned\r\nwas quietly threading his way on horseback to meet his appointment.\r\nFar out from the county seat, in a wild and sparsely populated\r\nlocality, at a sudden turn in the road he found himself in the\r\nimmediate presence of a worshipping congregation in God's first\r\ntemple.  It was what is known in mountain parlance as a \"protracted\r\nmeeting.\"  The hour was noon, and the little flock had just been\r\ncalled from labor to refreshment.  The cloth was spread in the\r\nshade of a large tree, and liberally supplied with ham, fried\r\nchicken, salt-rising bread, corn dodgers, cucumber pickles, and\r\nother wholesome edibles.  When Vance appeared upon the scene,\r\nthe leader of the little flock at once greeted him with cordial\r\ninvitation to \"light and take a bite with us.\"  The candidate\r\naccepted the invitation, and fastening his horse to a convenient\r\ntree, approached the assembled worshippers, introducing himself as\r\n\"Zeb Vance, Whig candidate for Congress.\"  The thought uppermost\r\nin his soul as he shook hands all around and accepted the proffered\r\nhospitality was, \"What denomination is this?  Methodist?  Baptist?\r\n_What?\"_  As soon as this inquiry could be satisfactorily answered,\r\nhe was, of course, ready to join; his \"letter\" was ready to be\r\nhanded in.  But as he quickly scanned the faces about him, he could\r\nget no gleam of light upon the all-important question.  Suddenly\r\nhis meditations were ended, the abstract giving way to the concrete,\r\nby the aforementioned leader abruptly inquiring, \"Mr. Vance,\r\nwhat persuasion are you of?\"\r\n\r\nThe hour had struck.  The dreaded inquiry must be answered\r\nsatisfactorily _and at once._  That Vance was equal to the emergency\r\nwill be seen from the sequel.\r\n\r\nPromptly laying down the chicken leg, the chunk of salt-rising\r\nbread, and cucumber pickle with which he had been abundantly supplied\r\nby one of the dear old sisters, and assuming an appropriate oratorical\r\npose, with his eyes intent upon his interrogator, he began:\r\n\r\n\"My sainted grandfather was, during the later years of his long\r\nand useful life, a ruling elder in the Presbyterian Church.\"\r\nThe gathering brow and shaking head of the local shepherd would\r\neven to a less observing man than the candidate have been sufficient\r\nwarning that he was on the wrong trail.  \"But,\" continued the\r\nspeaker, \"my father during long years of faithful service in the\r\nMaster's cause was an equally devout member of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopalian Church.\"\r\n\r\nThe sombre aspect of the shepherd, with the no less significant\r\nshake of the head, was unmistakable intimation to our candidate\r\nthat danger was in the very air.  Rallying himself, however, for\r\nthe last charge, with but one remaining shot in his locker, the\r\norator earnestly resumed:  \"But, when _I_ came to the years of\r\nmaturity, and was able, after prayer and meditation, to read and\r\nunderstand that blessed book myself, I came to the conclusion _that\r\nthe old Baptist Church was right.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Bless God!\" exclaimed the old preacher, seizing Vance by the hand.\r\n\"He is all right, brethren!  Oh, you'll get all the votes in these\r\nparts, Brother Vance!\"\r\n\r\nTalking along religious lines at the time of the visit mentioned, he\r\nillustrated the difference between profession and practice.  \"Now,\r\nthere is my brother Bob,\" referring to General Robert B. Vance;\r\n\"he is, you know, a Methodist, and believes in falling from grace,\r\n_but he never falls,_ while I am a Presbyterian, and don't believe\r\nin falling from grace, _but I am always falling!\"_\r\n\r\nThe first wife of Senator Vance was a Presbyterian.  Some years\r\nafter her death, he was married to an excellent lady, a devoted\r\nmember of the Roman Catholic Church.  Soon thereafter, he was taken\r\nto task by an old Presbyterian neighbor, who expressed great surprise\r\nthat he should marry a Catholic.  \"Well,\" replied the Senator with\r\nimperturbably good humor, \"the fact is, Uncle John, as I had tried\r\nRum, and tried Rebellion, I just thought I would try Romanism too!\"\r\n\r\nMany years ago, near the western border of Buncombe County, lived an\r\nold negro who had in early life been a member of the family of the\r\nfather of Senator Vance.  In a little cabin at the foot of the\r\nmountain, \"Uncle Ephraim,\" as the old negro was familiarly called,\r\nwas, as he had been for two or three decades, \"living on borrowed time.\"\r\nHow old he was no man could tell.  When in confidential mood, he\r\nwould sometimes tell of the troubles he and his old master used to\r\nhave with the Tories during the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nMr. Vance, in his first race for Congress, having finished his\r\nspeech at the cross-roads near by, visited the old man, from whom,\r\nof course, he received a warm welcome.  In reply to the inquiry of\r\nhis visitor as to how he was getting along, the old negro slowly\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"Mighty po'ly, mighty po'ly, Mause Zeb, mighty po'ly forninst\r\nthe things of dis world, but it's all right over yander, over\r\nyander.\"\r\n\r\n\"What church do you belong to, Uncle Ephraim?\" said Vance.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mause Zeb, I's a Presbyterian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Ephraim,\" said Vance with great solemnity, \"do you believe in\r\nthe doctrine of _election?\"_\r\n\r\nAfter a pause and with equal solemnity, the old man responded:\r\n\"Mause Zeb, I don't pertend to understand fully the ins and outs\r\nof dat doctrine, but 'cordin' to my understandin', it's de doctrine\r\nof de Bible, and I bleebes it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Ephraim,\" said Vance, \"do you think I have been _elected?\"_\r\n\r\n\"Mause Zeb,\" said the old man in pathetic tone, \"ef it's jest de\r\nsame to you, I would a leetle ruther you would wifdraw dat question.\r\nI's poorty ole and gittn' a little too near de grabe to tell a lie,\r\nbut de fac am, I bin livin' round in dese parts nigh onto a hundred\r\nyears and knowed a heap of de big mens dat's dead and gone, and\r\nI neber yet knowed nor hear tell of no man bein' 'lected, _what\r\nwan't a candidate.\"_\r\n\r\nLike many other orators of his party, Senator Vance found the\r\nposition of champion of the Democratic nominee for President in\r\n1872 one of extreme embarrassment.  A story he occasionally\r\ntold, however, relieved the situation greatly.  He said:  \"My\r\nfellow-citizens, I am somewhat in the position of an old-time\r\nilliterate backwoods preacher, who was with great difficulty able to\r\nread off, after a fashion, one favorite hymn at which his book\r\nalways opened at the opportune moment.  One Sunday morning, just\r\nbefore the beginning of the services, some mischievous boys, not\r\nhaving the fear of the Lord before their eyes, got hold of the book\r\nand pasted 'Old Grimes' over the favorite hymn.  At the auspicious\r\nmoment the book opened at the accustomed place, and the old preacher,\r\nafter properly adjusting his glasses, slowly began:  'Old Grimes\r\nis dead, that good old man.'  Amazed beyond description, the preacher\r\ninstantly suspended the reading, carefully wiped off his glasses, looked\r\nappealingly to the congregation, and again solemnly and slowly\r\nbegan:  'Old Grimes is dead, that good old man.'  The congregation\r\nnow equally astonished with himself, the aged pastor suspended the\r\nreading, carefully removed his glasses, and laying down the\r\nbook, solemnly observed:  'My beloved friends, I have been a-readin'\r\nand a-singin' outen this blessed book for nigh onto forty year,\r\nand I never seed this hymn in thar before; but it's _in thar,_\r\nbrethren, and we'll sing it through if it smashes up this meetin!'\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Vance, \"my beloved brethren, I have been a-readin'\r\nand a-votin' of the Democrat ticket nigh onto forty year, and I\r\nnever seed the name of old Horace Greeley on a Democrat ticket\r\nbefore; but it's _on thar,_ brethren, and we'll vote it through if\r\nit kills us--_and it does come devilish near killing the most of\r\nus!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\nNOT GUILTY OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL\r\n\r\nTHE \"DRAKE CONSTITUTION\" IN MISSOURI--THE CRIME OF PREACHING THE\r\nGOSPEL--A PROVISION OF THIS CONSTITUTION FOUND TO BE A VIOLATION\r\nOF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES--MINISTERS OF VARIOUS\r\nSECTS TRIED FOR PREACHING WITHOUT FIRST TAKING AN OATH TO SUPPORT\r\nTHE \"DRAKE CONSTITUTION\"--THE JUDGE FINDS THAT NOT ONE OF THEM HAS\r\nPREACHED THE GOSPEL.\r\n\r\nThe \"holding\" of a _nisi prius_ judge upon one of the western\r\ncircuits of Missouri, near the close of the Civil War, is without a\r\nprecedent, and it is quite probable that no occasion will ever\r\narise for citing it as an authority.  It will remain, however, a\r\ncase in point of how a \"horse-sense\" judge can protect the innocent\r\nagainst unusual and unjust prosecution.\r\n\r\nWhat is known in Missouri history as the \"Drake Constitution\"\r\nhad then but recently supplanted the organic law under which the\r\nState had for a long time had its being.  No counterpart of the\r\nConstitution mentioned has ever been framed in any of the American\r\nStates.  It could have been only the product of the evil days when\r\n\"judgment had fled to brutish beasts, and men had lost their reason.\"\r\nPossibly at no time or place in our history has there been more\r\nemphatic verification of the axiom, \"In the midst of arms, the laws\r\nare silent.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Drake Constitution\" was formulated at a time when fierce\r\npassion was at its height, when the sad consequences of civil\r\nwar were felt at every fireside, when neighbor was arrayed against\r\nneighbor, the hand of brother uplifted against brother, and \"a\r\nman's foes were they of his own household.\"  As is well known,\r\ncertain provisions of this Constitution were, at a later day--upon\r\na writ of error--set aside by the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nas being in violation of the Federal Constitution.  One of the\r\nthirty distinct affirmations or tests of the Drake Constitution was\r\nto the effect that, if any minister or priest should be guilty of\r\nthe crime of preaching the Gospel, or of solemnizing the rite of\r\nmarriage, without first having taken an oath to support said\r\nConstitution, he should, upon conviction, be subjected to a fine\r\nof not less than five hundred dollars, imprisonment for six months\r\nin the common jail, or both.\r\n\r\nUnder the provision indicated, a Catholic priest was convicted\r\nin one of the circuit courts of Missouri, and duly sentenced to\r\nfine and imprisonment.  Upon his appeal, the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States reversed the decision of the lower court, and\r\nvirtually abrogated the provision of the Constitution under which the\r\naccused had been convicted.  The great court of last resort decided\r\nthe test oath, imposed as above mentioned, to be a violation of\r\nthat provision of the Constitution of the United States which\r\ndeclares, \"No State shall pass any bill of attainder, or _ex\r\npost facto_ law.\"  It held a bill of attainder to be \"a legislative\r\nact which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial\"; and an\r\n_ex post facto_ law \"one which imposes a punishment for an act\r\nwhich was not punishable at the time it was committed; or imposes\r\nadditional punishment to that then prescribed.\"  The court said:\r\n\"The oath thus required is, for its severity, without any precedent\r\nthat we can discover.  In the first place, it is retrospective; it\r\nembraces all the past from this day; and if taken years hence,\r\nit will also cover all the intervening period. . . . It allows no\r\ndistinction between acts springing from malignant enmity, and acts\r\nwhich may have been prompted by charity, or affection, or relationship.\r\n. . . The clauses in question subvert the presumption of innocence,\r\nand alter the rules of evidence which heretofore, under the\r\nuniversally recognized principles of the common law, have been\r\nsupposed to be fundamental and unchangeable.  They assume that the\r\nparties are guilty; they call upon the parties to establish\r\ntheir innocence; and declare that such innocence can only be shown\r\nin one way--by an inquisition in the form of an expurgatory oath\r\ninto the consciences of the parties.\"  And then, as preliminary to\r\nthe discharge of the priest from long imprisonment, the court\r\nconcluded its opinion with a pertinent question from the writings of\r\nAlexander Hamilton:  \"It substitutes for the established and legal\r\nmode of investigating crimes and inflicting forfeitures, one that is\r\nunknown to the Constitution, and repugnant to the genius of our\r\nlaw.\"*\r\n\r\n[*Footnote: Fourth Wallace Reports.]\r\n\r\nDuring the period extending from the promulgation of the Drake\r\nConstitution to the setting aside of some of its obnoxious provisions\r\nas heretofore mentioned, an old-time judge still held court on one\r\nof the Missouri circuits.  He had somehow been overlooked in the\r\npolitical upheaval to which the State had been subjected.  He\r\nhad come down from a former generation, and, unabashed by the clash\r\nof arms, still served sturdily on his wonted way.  The rife spirit\r\nthat boded destruction to ancient landmarks had passed him by;\r\nMagna Charta and the Bill of Rights were to him abiding verities.\r\n\r\nNow it so fell out that during the period mentioned, while presiding\r\nin one of the border counties of his circuit, he was greatly\r\nastonished, at the opening of his court upon a certain morning, to\r\nfind half a dozen ministers of the Gospel, all of whom were personally\r\nknown to him, snugly seated in the prisoners' box.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic brusqueness, the judge at once demanded of the\r\nattorney for the Commonwealth why these men were under arrest.\r\nThe not unexpected reply was, that they had been indicted for\r\npreaching without first taking an oath to support the Constitution\r\nof the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Prosecutor, a very serious offence, a very serious offence\r\nindeed.  The makers of our fundamental law have wisely provided\r\nthat no man shall be permitted to preach the Gospel until he has\r\nfirst taken an oath to support the Constitution of the State of\r\nMissouri.  It is the duty of this court to see to it that this\r\nwholesome provision of our Constitution is duly enforced.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing himself now to the prisoner nearest him, His Honor\r\ninquired:  \"Is it possible, sir, that you have been guilty of\r\nthe crime of preaching the Gospel without having first taken an\r\noath to support the Constitution of the State of Missouri?\"  The\r\nprisoner, a tall, venerable-appearing gentleman, in typical black,\r\nquietly replied that he could not conscientiously take the required\r\noath, but had only continued in the pastoral work in which he\r\nhad been for a lifetime engaged.\r\n\r\n\"A mere subterfuge, a mere subterfuge, Mr. Prosecutor,\" observed\r\nthe judge, as with apparent fierceness his eyes were fixed upon\r\nthe offender.  \"This prisoner cannot be permitted, sir, to interpose\r\nhis conscience as a barrier against the enforcement of this salutary\r\nprovision of our most excellent Constitution.  He must be punished,\r\nsir, he must be punished.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reading aloud the penalty imposed for the commission of\r\nthe offence mentioned, and with pen in hand as if about to make\r\nthe appropriate entry upon the docket, His Honor again turned to\r\nthe prisoner and inquired:\r\n\r\n\"Of what church are you a minister?\"  The steady reply, as of\r\none prepared for the worst, was,\r\n\r\n\"I am a Presbyterian, Your Honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Presbyterian!  Presbyterian!\" quickly observed the sage interpreter\r\nof the law.  \"Oh, you preach the tenets and doctrines of the\r\nPresbyterian Church, do you?\"  An affirmative reply was modestly\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n\"You preach,\" continued His Honor in apparent amazement, \"the\r\ndoctrine of infant baptism, and of the final perseverance of the\r\nsaints, do you?\"  An answer like the last being given, the judge\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"You appear to be a man of intelligence, but don't you know,\r\nsir, that _that_ isn't the Gospel?  He has not been guilty of\r\npreaching the Gospel, Mr. Prosecutor, _and will have to be discharged._\r\nYou can go, sir, but if this court ever hears that you have been\r\nactually guilty of preaching _the Gospel,_ you will be punished to\r\nthe full extent of the law.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing himself now to the comparatively youthful occupant of\r\nthe lately vacated seat, His Honor inquired:\r\n\r\n\"What is _your_ church, sir?\"\r\n\r\nIn a manner by no means aggressive, and with tones the counterpart\r\nof the humblest that ever came from an Amen corner, the reply was,\r\n\r\n\"I am a Methodist, may it please the Court.\"\r\n\r\nEying the prisoner keenly, and with a manner expressive of surprise\r\nto which all that had gone before seemed indifference itself,\r\nhis Honor, with apparent difficulty, at length ejaculated:\r\n\r\n\"A Methodist, a Methodist, Mr. Prosecutor.  Oh, you preach the\r\ndoctrine of the Methodist Church, do you?--infant baptism, and\r\nfalling from grace?\"  To these hurried interrogatories, an affirmative\r\nwas meekly but distinctly given.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't you know that _that_ isn't the Gospel?  He is not\r\nguilty of preaching the Gospel, Mr. Prosecutor, and will have to\r\nbe discharged.  You can go, sir, but if this Court ever learns that\r\nyou have been really guilty of preaching the Gospel without\r\nfirst taking an oath to support the Constitution of the State of\r\nMissouri, you will have to be punished, sir; the Court will see\r\nthat there is no evasion of this salutary provision of our most\r\nexcellent Constitution.  _Go, sir.\"_\r\n\r\nA clean-shaven, benevolent-looking gentleman of middle age was next\r\nin evidence.  He had but recently assumed his present pastorate\r\nand was a deeply interested and attentive observer of all that was\r\nhappening.  In reply to the inquiry from the bench, he answered\r\nthat he was a Universalist.\r\n\r\n\"A Universalist!\" replied the judge, almost astounded beyond the\r\npower of expression.  Recovering himself, he at length inquired:\r\n\r\n\"You preach the doctrine of universal salvation, do you?\"\r\n\r\nA slight bow indicated such to be the fact.\r\n\r\n\"You preach,\" continued his Honor, with warmth well suited to\r\nthe subject-matter, \"that there is no hell?\"\r\n\r\nA bow, much more emphatic, was unmistakable evidence that its author\r\nwas a man who had the courage of his convictions.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't believe that _there is any hell,_ Mr. Prosecutor,\"\r\nthundered the judge, \"he will have to be discharged; it is no\r\nviolation of the Constitution of the State of Missouri to preach\r\nsuch infernal nonsense as that.\"\r\n\r\nThe official admonition, \"Depart, sir,\" was promptly obeyed, and\r\nthe apostle of the broad highway followed quickly in the wake of\r\nthe aforementioned disciples of Calvin and Wesley, in the \"narrow path\"\r\nwhich led straightway out of the crowded court-room.\r\n\r\nIn rapid succession the two remaining prisoners on the front bench\r\nwere questioned, and each in turn found \"not guilty\" of preaching the\r\nGospel.  An avowal of his belief in the tenet of \"the Apostolic\r\nsuccession\" instantly resulted in the acquittal of the first, while\r\nthe second was with equal promptness found \"not guilty\" upon his\r\nadmission that he preached the doctrine of \"regeneration by ----\"\r\nThere was much confusion in the court-room at this moment, and\r\nthe reporter failed to catch the concluding words of the confession.\r\nFinding himself, moreover, getting into _deep water,_ he thoughtfully\r\nleft on record that both the Episcopalian and the Christian pastor\r\nleft the court-room with the admonition ringing in their ears, that\r\nif they were ever actually found guilty _of preaching the Gospel_\r\nthey should be duly punished.\r\n\r\nA lone prisoner remained in the dock.  The days of the years of\r\nhis pilgrimage were not few, and quite probably, except in a\r\nfigurative sense, not evil.  He was of sturdy build, quiet manners,\r\nand his countenance was indicative of great sincerity.  In a voice\r\nextremely deferential he stated that he had once ministered to a\r\ndying Confederate, and it was impossible for him to take the required\r\noath that he had never expressed any sympathy for any person who\r\nhad ever been engaged in the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"Of what church are you a minister?\" interrupted the judge.\r\n\r\n\"The Baptist Church,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"The Baptist Church,\" instantly repeated the judge, and looking\r\nvery earnestly at the accused, he asked;\r\n\r\n\"Do you preach the doctrines of the Baptist Church?\"\r\n\r\nAn affirmative answer having been given, His Honor said:\r\n\r\n\"Upon his own confession he is guilty, Mr. Prosecutor:  the\r\nCourt holds the Baptist _to be the true church,_ and this defendant\r\nhas been guilty of preaching the Gospel without first taking the\r\noath to support the Constitution of the State of Missouri.  He will\r\nhave to be punished.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing the prisoner, he said:  \"You will have to be punished, sir;\r\nthis Court can permit no excuse or evasion.\"\r\n\r\nThe graveyard stillness that now fell upon the little assemblage\r\nwas at length broken by His Honor reading aloud the prescribed\r\npunishment for preaching the Gospel without first having taken the\r\nrequired oath.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a fine of five hundred dollars or six months in the common\r\njail, _or both._  A clear case, Mr. Prosecutor, this prisoner must\r\nbe made an example of; hand me the docket, Mr. Clerk.  Yes, the\r\nfull penalty.\"\r\n\r\nThen, before making the fatal entry, suddenly turning to the\r\nprisoner, he demanded:\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been preaching the Gospel?\"\r\n\r\nIn hardly audible accents, the answer tremblingly given was,\r\n\r\n\"I have been trying to preach the Gospel ----\"\r\n\r\n\"Only _trying_ to preach the Gospel, only _trying_ to preach the\r\nGospel!\" exclaimed the judge.  \"There is no law, Mr. Prosecutor,\r\nagainst merely _trying_ to preach the Gospel.  You can go, sir;\r\nbut if this Court ever hears that you have succeeded in actually\r\n_preaching_ the Gospel, you will be punished, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\nAMONG THE ACTORS\r\n\r\nTHE GIVING OF PLEASURE THE ACTOR'S AIM--PRAISE OF NOTABLE ACTORS\r\n--BARRETT, FORREST, McCULLOUGH, EDWIN BOOTH, WILKES BOOTH, JEFFERSON,\r\nIRVING--MACBETH'S PRAISE OF SLEEP.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of October 27, 1908, a meeting was held in the Grand\r\nOpera House, Chicago, Illinois, in the interest of the Democratic\r\ncandidates in the campaign then pending.  The meeting began a few\r\nminutes after midnight, and the immense audience consisted, in a\r\nlarge measure, of actors and actresses and their attendants from\r\nthe various theatres of the city.\r\n\r\nAfter an eloquent political speech of the Hon. Samuel Alschuler\r\nand a stirring recitation by one of the actors, I was introduced, and\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity under such happy auspices, to\r\nbid you _good-morning._  I would count myself fortunate, indeed,\r\ncould I contribute even the smallest mite to the enjoyment of those\r\nwho have in such unstinted measure dispensed pleasure to so many\r\nof the human family, to the representatives of a profession which,\r\nstruggling up through the centuries, has at last found honored and\r\nabiding place in a broader civilization, a calling whose sublime\r\nmission it is to give surcease to harassing care, to smooth out\r\nthe wrinkles from the brow, bring gladness to the eye, to teach that\r\n\r\n  'Behind the clouds is the sun still smiling';\r\n\r\nin a word, to add to the sum of human happiness.\r\n\r\n\"It has been my good fortune, in the happy years gone by, to have had\r\nthe personal acquaintance of some of the most eminent of your\r\nprofession.  Under the witchery of this inspiring presence, 'the\r\ngraves of memory render up their dead.'  Again I hear from the lips\r\nof Barrett:  'Take away the sword; States can be saved without it!'\r\n'How love, like death, levels all ranks, and lays the shepherd's\r\ncrook beside the sceptre!'\r\n\r\n\"Who that ever saw Forrest 'sitting as if in judgment upon kings' could\r\nforget that superb presence?  In the silent watches, even yet,\r\nsteal upon us in ominous accents the words, 'Put out the light,\r\nand then put out the light!'  Complimented upon the manner in which\r\nhe played Lear, he angrily exclaimed:  'Played Lear, played Lear?\r\nI _play_ Hamlet, I _play_ Macbeth, I _play_ Othello; but I _am_\r\nLear!'  Possibly the art of the tragedian has known no loftier\r\ntriumph than in Forrest's rendition of Lear's curse upon the\r\nunnatural daughter:\r\n\r\n  'Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;\r\n  With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;\r\n  Turn all her mother's pains and benefits\r\n  To laughter and contempt!'\r\n\r\n\"A third of a century ago, I made the acquaintance of John McCullough,\r\nthen at the very zenith of his fame.  In even measure as was the\r\nelder Booth Richard the Third, Forrest, King Lear, or Edwin Booth,\r\nHamlet, so was McCullough the born Macbeth.  When I first saw\r\nhim emerge with dishevelled hair and bloody hands from the apartment\r\nof the murdered king, I was, I confess, in mortal dread of the\r\ndarkness.  I have heard another since of even greater repute in\r\nthat masterful impersonation, but with me to the last, John McCullough\r\nwill remain the veritable Macbeth.  His are the words that linger:\r\n\r\n  'I go, and it is done; the bell invites me,\r\n  Hear it not, Duncan; for it is the knell\r\n  That summons thee to heaven or to hell.'\r\n\r\n\"Edwin Booth has stepped from the stage of living men, and when in\r\nthe tide of time will such a Hamlet again appear?  To him Nature\r\nhad been prodigal of her choicest blessings.  Every gift the\r\ngods could bestow to the full equipment of the interpreter, the\r\nactor, the master, was his.\r\n\r\n  'He was a man, take him for all in all,\r\n  We shall not look upon his like again.'\r\n\r\nMany moons will wax and wane before from other lips, as from\r\nhis, will fall:\r\n\r\n  'Or that the Everlasting had not fixed\r\n  His canon 'gainst self-slaughter.'\r\n\r\nor, giving expression to thoughts from the very depths, which have\r\nin all the ages held back from such dread ending:\r\n\r\n  'To die, to sleep;\r\n  To sleep! perchance to dream; aye, there's the rub;\r\n  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\r\n  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\r\n  Must give us pause.'\r\n\r\n\"The ever-abiding memory that his brother was the real actor in\r\na tragic scene that gave pause to the world, burdened the heart\r\nand mellowed the tone of Edwin Booth, and no doubt linked him in\r\ncloser touch with what has, as by the enchanter's wand, been\r\nportrayed of the 'melancholy Dane.'\r\n\r\n\"Two years before the assassination of President Lincoln I heard\r\nWilkes Booth as Romeo at the old McVicker.  The passing years have\r\nnot wholly dimmed his\r\n\r\n  'Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day\r\n  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops,'\r\n\r\nand then, as if forecasting a scene to strike horror even in 'States\r\nunborn and in accents yet unknown,' the exclamation:\r\n\r\n  'I must be gone and live,\r\n  Or stay and die!'\r\n\r\n\"High on the list of the world's benefactors write the name of Joe\r\nJefferson, as one who loved his fellow-men.  Whatever betide,\r\nhis fame is secure.  'Age cannot wither'; it was in very truth high\r\nprivilege to have known him; to have met him face to face.\r\n\r\n\"There come moments to all when we gladly put aside the masterpieces\r\nof the great bard, and find solace in simpler lays; such as, it\r\nmay be, appear of kinship with the happenings of daily life.\r\nThe mighty thoughts of the former unceasingly suggest life's endless\r\ntoil and endeavor.\r\n\r\n\"In words that have touched many hearts our own poet suggests:\r\n\r\n  'Read from some humbler poet,\r\n  Whose songs gushed from his heart;\r\n  . . . . . . .\r\n  Such songs have power to quiet\r\n  The restless pulse of care.'\r\n\r\n\"And so, there are times when the stately rendition of the\r\nmasterpieces, even with the greatest tragedians in the role, weary\r\nus, and we give glad welcome to Bob Acres with 'his courage oozing\r\nout at his finger ends,' or to dear old Rip and 'Here's to yourself\r\nand to your family.  Jus' one more; _this one won't count!'_\r\n\r\n\"The superb acting of Irving in Louis the Eleventh; the grandeur\r\nof Forrest with 'Othello's occupation gone'; of McCullough in\r\nMacbeth, 'supped full with horrors'; even of Booth with the\r\never-recurring 'To be, or not to be,' the eternal question, all\r\npass with the occasion.  But who can forget the gladsome hours\r\nof mingled pathos and mirth with glorious Joe Jefferson, the star!\r\nHis life was hourly the illustration of the sublime truth:\r\n\r\n  'There is nothing so kingly as kindness.'\r\n\r\n\"Upon his tablet might truly be written:\r\n\r\n  'He never made a brow look dark,\r\n  Nor caused a tear but when he died.'\r\n\r\n\"It is ever an ungracious task to speak in terms of disparagement of\r\na lady.  There is one, however, of whom, even in this gracious\r\npresence, I am constrained to speak without restraint.  To the\r\nsplendid assemblage before me she was unknown; possibly, however, some\r\nveteran upon this platform may have enjoyed her personal\r\nacquaintance.  I refer to the late Mrs. Macbeth.  I would not be\r\nmisunderstood.  My criticism of the conduct of this lady has no\r\nreference to her share in the 'taking off' of the venerable Duncan.\r\nEven barring her gentle interposition, he would long ere this have\r\n'paid his breath to time and mortal custom.'  My cause of complaint\r\nis more serious and far-reaching.  It will be remembered that\r\nher high-placed husband upon a time was the victim of insomnia.\r\nIn his wakeful hours, as he tossed upon his couch, he even made\r\nthe confession, now of record, that\r\n\r\n  'Glamis hath murdered sleep.'\r\n\r\n\"He apparently drew no comfort from the reflection that his late\r\nbenefactor, the murdered king,\r\n\r\n  'After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.'\r\n\r\n\"Burdened with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls, the\r\nsometimes Thane of Cawdor indulged in an apostrophe to 'the dull\r\ngod' which has enduring place in all language:\r\n\r\n  'Sleep, that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care\r\n  The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,\r\n  Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,\r\n  Chief nourisher in Life's feast, ----'\r\n\r\n\"At this crucial moment, came the untimely interruption of Mrs.\r\nMacbeth, demanding of her husband, _'What do you mean?'_\r\n\r\n\"The spell was broken, and for all time the sublime apostrophe\r\nto sleep unfinished.  What he might next have said, whose lips can\r\ntell?  Words possibly to be spoken by every tongue, to be crystallized\r\ninto every language.  Her ill-fated interruption can never be\r\nforgiven.  The practical lesson to be drawn, one for all the ages,\r\nis the peril involved in a wife's _untimely interruption_ of the\r\nwise observations and sage reflections of her husband.\r\n\r\n\"This coming together to-night may justify the remark that satire upon\r\nthe proverbial caution of candidates in expressing an opinion _upon\r\nany subject_ was perhaps never better illustrated than in the\r\nincident now to be related.  Upon a time many years ago, when\r\napproaching the Capitol from Pennsylvania Avenue in company with\r\nmy friend Proctor Knott, a tall, solemn-appearing individual\r\naddressed the latter as follows;  'Mr. Knott, I would like to have\r\nyour opinion as to which is the best play, \"Hamlet\" or \"Macbeth.\"'\r\nWith a characteristic expression of countenance, Knott, with\r\ndeprecatory gesture, slowly replied:\r\n\r\n\"'My friend, don't ask me that question; I am a politician, a\r\ncandidate for Congress, and my district is about equally divided; Hamlet\r\nhas his friends down there, and Macbeth has his, and _I will take no\r\npart between them.'_\r\n\r\n\"This observation recalls an incident of recent occurrence in a\r\nneighboring city.  A friend of mine, a minister of the Gospel--you\r\nwill bear in mind that my friends are not _all_ actors--and this\r\nrecalls the dilemma of a candidate who, upon inquiry as to the\r\ncomparative merits of heaven and its antipode, cautiously declined\r\nto express an opinion, on the ground that _he had friends in\r\nboth places_--this minister, upon being installed in a new pastorate,\r\nwas almost immediately requested to preach at the funeral of a\r\nprominent member of his congregation.  Unacquainted as he was with\r\nthe life of the deceased, he made inquiry as to his last utterances.\r\n\r\n\"He recalled the last words of Webster, 'I am content'; of John\r\nQuincy Adams, 'This is the last of earth'; and even the cheerless\r\nexclamation of Mirabeau, 'Let my ears be filled with martial music,\r\ncrown me with flowers, and thus shall I enter on my eternal sleep.'\r\nCharged with these reflections, and hoping to find the nucleus of a\r\nfuneral sermon, the minister made inquiry of the son of the deceased\r\nparishioner, 'What were the last words of your father?'  The unexpected\r\nreply was 'Pap he didn't have _no last words;_ mother she just stayed\r\nby him till he died.'\r\n\r\n\"And now, my friends, as the curtain falls, my last words to you:\r\n\r\n  'Say not Good-night,\r\n  But in some brighter clime\r\n  Bid me Good-morning!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\nTHE LOST ART OF ORATORY\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER'S SPEECHES--HIS PATRIOTIC SERVICE IN FORMULATING\r\nTHE ASHBURTON TREATY--PRENTISS'S DEFENCE OF THE RIGHT OF MISSISSIPPI\r\nTO REPRESENTATION--THE EFFECT OF HIS ELOQUENCE ON A MURDERER--HIS\r\nPLEA FOR MERCY TO A CLIENT--WEBSTER WINS AN APPARENTLY HOPELESS\r\nCASE--INGERSOLL'S REVIEW OF THE CAREER OF NAPOLEON--HON.

BRYAN'S ELOQUENCE\r\n--CLOSING SENTENCES OF HIS \"PRINCE OF PEACE.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the must cultured and entertaining gentlemen I have ever\r\nknown was the late Gardner Hubbard.  His last years were spent\r\nquietly in Washington, but earlier in life he was an active member\r\nof the Massachusetts bar.\r\n\r\nIn my conversations with him he related many interesting incidents\r\nof Daniel Webster, with whom he was well acquainted.  In the early\r\nprofessional life of Hubbard, Mr. Webster was still at the bar;\r\nhis speech for the prosecution in the memorable Knapp murder trial\r\nhas been read with profound interest by three generations of lawyers.\r\nAs a powerful and eloquent discussion of circumstantial evidence, in\r\nall its phases, it scarcely has a parallel; quotations from it have\r\nfound their way into all languages.  How startling his description\r\nof the stealthy tread of the assassin upon his victim!  We seem to\r\nstand in the very presence of murder itself:\r\n\r\n\"Deep sleep had fallen on the destined victim and on all beneath\r\nhis roof.  A healthful old man, to whom sleep was sweet, and the\r\nfirst sound slumbers of the night held him in their soft but strong\r\nembrace.  The assassin enters through the window, already prepared,\r\ninto an unoccupied apartment.  With noiseless foot he paces the\r\nlonely hall, half lighted by the moon; he winds up the ascent of\r\nthe stairs, and reaches to door of the chamber .... The face of\r\nthe innocent sleeper is turned from the murderer, and the beams of\r\nthe moon, resting on the gray locks of his aged temple, show him\r\nwhere to strike.  The fatal blow is given, and the victim\r\npasses, without a struggle, from the repose of sleep to the repose\r\nof death.  The deed is done.  He retreats, retraces his steps to\r\nthe window, passes out through it as he came in, and escapes.\r\nHe has done the murder.  No eye has seen him, no ear has heard him.\r\nThe secret is his own, and it is safe.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech throughout shows Webster to have been the perfect master\r\nof the human heart,--of its manifold and mysterious workings.  What\r\npicture could be more vivid than this?\r\n\r\n\"Such a secret can be safe nowhere.  The whole creation of God has\r\nneither nook nor corner where the guilty can bestow it and say\r\nit is safe.  Not to speak of that eye which pierces through all\r\ndisguises and beholds everything as in the splendor of noon,\r\nsuch secrets of guilt are never safe from detection even by men.\r\nTrue it is, generally speaking, that murder will out.  True it is,\r\nthat Providence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things,\r\nthat those who break the great law of Heaven by shedding man's\r\nblood seldom succeed in avoiding discovery.  Meantime the guilty\r\nsoul cannot keep its own secret.  It is false to itself; or rather,\r\nit feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself.\r\nIt labors under its guilty possession, and knows not what to do\r\nwith it.  The human heart was not made for the residence of such\r\nan inhabitant.\"\r\n\r\nThe closing sentences of the speech--which resulted in the conviction\r\nand execution of the prisoner--will endure in our literature\r\nunsurpassed as an inspiration to duty:\r\n\r\n\"There is no evil that we cannot either face or fly from but the\r\nconsciousness of duty disregarded.  A sense of duty pursues us\r\never.  It is omnipresent like the Deity.  If we take to ourselves the\r\nwings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the\r\nsea, duty performed, or duty violated, is still with us, for our\r\nhappiness or our misery.  If we say, 'the darkness shall cover us,'\r\nin the darkness as in the light our obligations are yet with us.\r\nWe cannot escape their power, nor fly from their presence.  They\r\nare with us in this life, will be with us at its close; and in that\r\nscene of inconceivable solemnity which lies yet farther onward, we\r\nshall still find ourselves surrounded by the consciousness of duty,\r\nto pain us wherever it has been violated, and to console us so far\r\nas God may have given us grace to perform it.\"\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, when in Boston, Mr. Hubbard and I visited together\r\nFaneuil Hall.  He pointed out the exact place upon the platform\r\nwhere he saw Mr. Webster stand when he delivered his speech in\r\nvindication of his course in remaining in the Cabinet of President\r\nTyler after all his Whig colleagues had resigned.  The schism in\r\nthe Whig ranks, occasioned by the veto of party measures, paramount\r\nin the Presidential contest of 1840, and the bitter antagonism\r\nthereby engendered between Henry Clay and President Tyler, will\r\nreadily be recalled.  The rupture mentioned occasioned the retirement\r\nof the entire Cabinet appointed by the late President Harrison,\r\nexcept Mr. Webster, the Secretary of State.  His reasons for\r\nremaining were in the highest degree patriotic, and his speech\r\nin Faneuil Hall a triumphant vindication.  The enduring public\r\nservice he rendered while in a Cabinet with which he had not partisan\r\naffiliation was formulating, in conjunction with the British\r\nMinister, the Ashburton treaty.  If Mr. Webster had rendered no\r\nother public service, this alone would have entitled him to the\r\ngratitude of the country.  This treaty, advantageous from so\r\nmany points of view to the United States, adjusted amicably the\r\nprotracted and perilous controversy--unsettled by the convention\r\nat Ghent--of our northeastern boundary, and possibly prevented a\r\nthird war between the two great English-speaking nations.  The\r\nwords once uttered of Burke could never with truth be spoken of\r\nWebster:  \"He gave to party that which was intended for his\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hubbard insisted that the speech mentioned stood unrivalled in\r\nthe realm of sublime oratory.  He declared that the intervening\r\nyears had not dimmed his recollection of the appearance of \"the\r\nGod-like Webster\" when he exclaimed \"The Whig party die!  The Whig\r\nparty die!  Then, Mr. President, _where shall I go?\"_\r\n\r\nSome years before, I heard Wendell Phillips allude to the above\r\nspeech in his celebrated lecture upon Daniel O'Connell.  He said, when\r\nthe startling words, \"Then, Mr. President, where shall I go?\" fell\r\nfrom the lips of the mighty orator, a feeling of awe pervaded\r\nthe vast assemblage; something akin to an awful foreboding that\r\nthe world would surely come to an end when there was no place in\r\nit for Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nThis seems a fitting place to allude to possibly the highest tribute\r\never paid by one great orator to another--in the loftiest sense,\r\na tribute of genius to genius.  Mr. Hubbard told me he was one\r\nof the immense audience gathered in Faneuil Hall to ratify the\r\nnomination of Harrison and Tyler soon after the adjournment of the\r\nWhig National Convention in 1840.  Edward Everett presided; and\r\namong the speakers were Winthrop, Choate, Webster, and the gifted\r\nSargent S. Prentiss of Mississippi.  The eloquence of the last\r\nnamed was a proverb in his day.  He had but recently delivered a\r\nspeech in the House, vindicating his right to his seat as a\r\nRepresentative from Mississippi, which cast a spell over all who\r\nheard it, and which has come down to the present generation as one\r\nof the masterpieces of oratory.  The closing sentence of this\r\nwondrous speech--a thousand times quoted--was:  \"Deny her representation\r\nupon this floor; then, Mr. Speaker, strike from yonder escutcheon the\r\nstar that glitters to the name of Mississippi--and leave only\r\nthe stripe, fit emblem of her degradation!\"\r\n\r\nUpon the conclusion of Prentiss's Faneuil Hall speech, just mentioned,\r\namidst a tumult of applause such as even Faneuil Hall had rarely\r\nwitnessed, Mr. Everett, turning to Mr. Webster, inquired:  \"Did\r\nyou ever hear the equal of that speech?\"  \"Never but once,\" was\r\nthe deep-toned reply, \"and then from Prentiss himself.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Baldwin, his long-time associate at the bar of Mississippi, has\r\ngiven a vivid description of the effect of the power of Mr. Prentiss\r\nbefore the jury in the prosecution of a noted highwayman and murderer\r\nin that State:\r\n\r\n\"Phelps was one of the most daring and desperate of ruffians.\r\nHe fronted his prosecutor and the court not only with composure,\r\nbut with scornful and malignant defiance.  When Prentiss arose\r\nto speak, and for some time afterwards, the criminal scowled upon him\r\na look of hate and insolence.  But when the orator, kindling with his\r\nsubject, turned upon him and poured down a stream of burning\r\ninvective like lava upon his head; when he depicted the villainy\r\nand barbarity of his bold atrocities; when he pictured, in dark\r\nand dismal colors, the fate which awaited him, and the awful judgment\r\nto be pronounced at another Bar upon his crimes when his soul be\r\nconfronted with his innocent victims; when he fixed his gaze of\r\nconcentrated power upon him, the strong man's face relaxed; his\r\neyes faltered and fell; until, at length, unable to bear up\r\nunder self-conviction, he hid his head beneath the bar, and exhibited\r\na picture of ruffianly audacity cowed beneath the spell of true\r\ncourage and triumphant genius.\"\r\n\r\nIn his early practice in Mississippi, in closing a touching and\r\neloquent appeal to the jury on behalf of a client whose life was\r\ntrembling in the balance, Prentiss said:\r\n\r\n\"I have somewhere read that when God in His eternal councils\r\nconceived the thought of man's creation, he called to him the three\r\nministers who wait constantly upon the throne, Justice, Truth, and\r\nMercy, and thus addressed them:\r\n\r\n\"'Shall we make man?'\r\n\r\n\"Then said Justice, 'O God, make him not, for he will trample upon\r\nThy laws.'\r\n\r\n\"Truth made answer also, 'O God, make him not, for he will pollute\r\nThy sanctuaries.'\r\n\r\n\"Then Mercy, dropping upon her knees and looking up through her\r\ntears, exclaimed, 'O God, make him.  I will watch over him through\r\nall the dark paths he may have to tread.'\r\n\r\n\"Then God made man and said to him:  'Thou art the child of Mercy;\r\n_go and deal in mercy with thy brother.'\"_\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Mr. Webster's marvellous power over a jury, Mr.\r\nHubbard told me that he was present during the trial of a once\r\ncelebrated divorce case in one of the courts of Boston.  The husband\r\nwas the complainant, and the alleged ground the one of recognized\r\nsufficiency in all countries.  Mr. Webster was the counsel for the\r\nhusband; Rufus Choate for the wife.  As an advocate, the latter has had\r\nfew equals, no superiors, at the American bar.  In the case mentioned,\r\nwith a distressed woman for a client, what was dearer than life, her\r\nreputation, in the balance, it may well be believed that the wondrous\r\npowers of the advocate were in requisition to the utmost.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Choate's speech, as Mr. Hubbard assured me,\r\nthe case of the injured husband appeared hopeless.  It seemed\r\nimpossible that such a speech could be successfully answered.\r\n\r\nThe opening sentence, in deep and measured tones, of Webster in\r\nreply, the prelude to an unrivalled argument and to victory, was:\r\n\r\n\"Saint Paul in the twenty-fourth verse of the seventh chapter of\r\nhis wondrous Epistle to the Romans says:  'O wretched man that I\r\nam! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'  You alone,\r\ngentlemen, can deliver this wretched man _from the body of this\r\ndead woman!\"_\r\n\r\nWhat in word-painting can exceed the following from an address\r\nby Robert G. Ingersoll?\r\n\r\n\"A little while ago, I stood by the grave of the old Napoleon--a\r\nmagnificent tomb of gilt and gold, almost fit for a dead deity--\r\nand gazed upon the sarcophagus of black Egyptian marble where rest\r\nthe ashes of that restless man.  I leaned over the balustrade\r\nand thought about the career of the greatest soldier of the modern\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"I saw him walking upon the banks of the Seine contemplating suicide.\r\nI saw him at Toulon; I saw him putting down the mob in the streets\r\nof Paris; I saw him at the head of the army in Italy; I saw him\r\ncrossing the bridge at Lodi with the tricolor in his hand; I saw\r\nhim in Egypt in the shadow of the Pyramids; I saw him conquer\r\nthe Alps and mingle the eagles of France with the eagles of the\r\ncrags; I saw him at Marengo, at Ulm, and at Austerlitz; I saw him in\r\nRussia, where the infantry of the snow and the cavalry of the wild\r\nblast scattered his legions like winter's withered leaves; I saw\r\nhim at Leipsic in defeat and disaster--driven by a million bayonets\r\nback upon Paris--clutched like a wild beast--banished to Elba.\r\nI saw him escape and retake an empire by the force of his genius.\r\nI saw him upon the frightful field of Waterloo, where Chance and\r\nFortune combined to wreck the fortunes of their former king, and\r\nI saw him at St. Helena, with his hands crossed behind him, gazing\r\nout upon the sad and solemn sea.\r\n\r\n\"I thought of the orphans and widows he had made, of the tears that\r\nhad been shed for his glory, and of the only woman who ever loved him,\r\npushed from his heart by the cold hand of ambition; and I said I\r\nwould rather have been a French peasant and worn wooden shoes; I\r\nwould rather have lived in a hut with a vine growing over the door,\r\nand the grapes growing purple in the rays of the autumn sun; I\r\nwould rather have been that poor peasant with my loving wife by my\r\nside, knitting as the day died out of the sky, with my children\r\nabout my knee and their arms about me; I would rather have been\r\nthat man and gone down to the tongueless silence of the dreamless dust,\r\nthan have been that imperial impersonation of force and murder.\"\r\n\r\nIn his eloquent eulogy upon Abraham Lincoln, my neighbor and friend,\r\nHon. Isaac N. Phillips, said:\r\n\r\n\"He lived with Nature and learned of her.  He toiled, but his toil\r\nwas never hopeless and degrading.  His feet were upon the earth\r\nbut the stars shining in perennial beauty were ever above him to\r\ninspire contemplation.  He heard the song of the thrush, and the\r\ncarol of the lark.  He watched the sun in its course.  He knew the\r\ndim paths of the forest, and his soul was awed by the power of the\r\nstorm.\"\r\n\r\nThe closing sentences of Senator Ingalls's tribute to a departed\r\ncolleague were sombre indeed:\r\n\r\n\"In the democracy of Death all men are equal.  There is neither\r\nrank, nor station, nor prerogative, in the republic of the grave.\r\nAt that fatal threshold the philosopher ceases to be wise, and the\r\nsong of the poet is silent.  There Dives relinquished his riches\r\nand Lazarus his rags; the creditor loses his usury, and the debtor\r\nis acquitted of his obligation; the proud man surrenders his dignity,\r\nthe politician his honors, the worldling his pleasures.  Here\r\nthe invalid needs no physician, and the laborer rests from unrequited\r\ntoil.  Here at last is Nature's final decree of equity.  The wrongs\r\nof time are redressed, and injustice is expiated.  The unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth and honor, capacity, pleasure, and opportunity,\r\nwhich makes life so cruel and inexplicable a tragedy, ceases in\r\nthe realms of Death.  The strongest has there no supremacy, and\r\nthe weakest needs no defence.  The mightiest captain succumbs to\r\nthe invincible adversary who disarms alike the victor and the\r\nvanquished.\"\r\n\r\nIn his day Edward Everett was the most gifted of American orators.\r\nHis style, however, to readers in \"these piping times of peace,\"\r\nseems a trifle stilted.  What orator of the twentieth century would\r\nattempt such a sentence as the following from Everett's celebrated\r\neulogy upon Washington:\r\n\r\n\"Let us make a national festival and holiday of his birthday;\r\nand ever, as the twenty-second of February returns, let us remember\r\nthat, while with these solemn and joyous rites of observance we\r\ncelebrate the great anniversary, our fellow-citizens on the Hudson,\r\non the Potomac, from the Southern plains to the Western lakes, are\r\nengaged in the same offices of gratitude and love.  Nor we, nor\r\nthey alone; beyond the Ohio, beyond the Mississippi, along that\r\nstupendous trail of immigration from the East to the West,\r\nwhich, bursting into States as it moves westward, is already\r\nthreading the Western prairies, swarming through the portals of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and winding down their slopes, the name and\r\nthe memory of Washington on that gracious night will travel with\r\nthe silver queen of heaven through sixty degrees of longitude, nor\r\npart company with her till she walks in her brightness through the\r\nGolden Gate of California, and passes serenely to hold midnight\r\ncourt with her Australian stars.  There and there only in barbarous\r\narchipelagos, as yet untrodden by civilized man, the name of\r\nWashington is unknown; and there, too, when they swarm with\r\nenlightened millions, new honors shall be paid with ours to his\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the greatest living orator is William J. Bryan.\r\nI have never known a more gifted man.  A thorough scholar--having like\r\nLord Bacon taken all knowledge for his province--a fearless champion\r\nof what he deems the right, he is in the loftiest sense \"without\r\nfear and without reproach.\"\r\n\r\nIn introducing him to an immense audience in Bloomington when he\r\nwas first a candidate for the Presidency, I said:\r\n\r\n\"The National Democracy in the Chicago convention selected for the\r\nPresidency a distinguished statesman of the great Northwest.\r\nFor the first time in more than one hundred years of our history, a\r\ncandidate for the great office has been taken from a State lying\r\nwest of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\"In the nomination of our standard-bearer, the convention builded better\r\nthan it knew.  Each passing hour has but emphasized the wisdom\r\nof its choice.  Truly it has been said:  'When the times demand\r\nthe man, the man appears.'  The times demanded a great leader--the\r\ngreat leader has appeared!  His campaign is the marvel of the age.\r\nFrom the Atlantic seaboard, two thousand miles to the westward,\r\nhis eloquent words have cheered the despondent, given new hopes and\r\naspirations to the people, touched the hearts of millions of his\r\ncountrymen.  In advocating his election we have kept the faith.\r\nWe have not departed from the teachings of our fathers.  We sacredly\r\npreserve the ancient landmarks--the landmarks of all previous\r\nDemocratic conventions.\"\r\n\r\nRarely has a speech been uttered so effective in its immediate\r\nresults as that of Mr. Bryan in the Democratic National Convention\r\nof 1896.  The occasion was one never to be forgotten.  When Mr.\r\nBryan began his speech he had not been mentioned as a candidate\r\nfor the Presidency; at its close there was no other candidate.\r\nThe closing sentences of the memorable speech were:\r\n\r\n\"Our ancestors, when but three millions in number, had the courage\r\nto declare their political independence of every other nation;\r\nshall we, their descendants, when we have grown to seventy millions,\r\ndeclare that we are less independent than our forefathers?  No, my\r\nfriends, that will never be the verdict of our people.  Therefore,\r\nwe care not upon what lines the battle is fought.  If they say\r\nbimetallism is good, but that we cannot have it until other nations\r\nhelp us, we reply that, instead of having a gold standard\r\nbecause England has, we will restore bimetallism, and then let\r\nEngland have bimetallism because the United States has it.  If they\r\ndare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as\r\na good thing, we will fight them to the uttermost.  Having behind us\r\nthe productive masses of this nation and the world, supported by the\r\ncommercial interests, the laboring interests, and the toilers\r\neverywhere, we will answer their demand for a gold standard by\r\nsaying to them:  'You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this\r\ncrown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of\r\ngold.'\"\r\n\r\nThe closing sentences of his \"Prince of Peace\" have been read in\r\nall languages:\r\n\r\n\"But this Prince of Peace promises not only peace but strength.\r\nSome have thought His teachings fit only for the weak and the timid\r\nand unsuited to men of vigor, energy, and ambition.  Nothing could\r\nbe farther from the truth.  Only the man of faith can be courageous.\r\nConfident that he fights on the side of Jehovah, he doubts not the\r\nsuccess of his cause.  What matters it whether he shares in the\r\nshouts of triumph?  If every word spoken in behalf of truth has\r\nits influence and every deed done for the right weighs in the final\r\naccount, it is immaterial to the Christian whether his eyes behold\r\nvictory or whether he dies in the midst of the conflict.\r\n\r\n  'Yea, though thou lie upon the dust,\r\n  When they who helped thee flee in fear,\r\n  Die full of hope and manly trust,\r\n  Like those who fell in battle here.\r\n  Another hand thy sword shall wield,\r\n  Another hand the standard wave,\r\n  Till from the trumpet's mouth is pealed\r\n  The blast of triumph o'er thy grave.'\r\n\r\n\"Only those who believe attempt the seemingly impossible and, by\r\nattempting, prove that one with God can chase a thousand and two\r\ncan put ten thousand to flight.  I can imagine that the early\r\nChristians who were carried into the arena to make a spectacle for\r\nthose more savage than the beasts, were entreated by their doubting\r\ncompanions not to endanger their lives.  But, kneeling in the centre\r\nof the arena, they prayed and sang until they were devoured.\r\nHow helpless they seemed and, measured by every human rule, how\r\nhopeless was their cause!  And yet within a few decades the\r\npower which they invoked proved mightier than the legions of the\r\nemperor, and the faith in which they died was triumphant o'er\r\nall that land.  It is said that those who went to mock at their\r\nsufferings returned asking themselves, 'What is it that can enter into\r\nthe heart of man and make him die as these die?'  They were greater\r\nconquerors in their death than they could have been had they\r\npurchased life by a surrender of their faith.\r\n\r\n\"What would have been the fate of the Church if the early Christians\r\nhad had as little faith as many of our Christians now have?  And, on\r\nthe other hand, if the Christians of to-day had the faith of the\r\nmartyrs, how long would it be before the fulfilment of the prophecy\r\nthat every knee shall bow and every tongue confess?\r\n\r\n\"Our faith should be even stronger than the faith of those who\r\nlived two thousand years ago, for we see our religion spreading\r\nand supplanting the philosophies and creeds of the Orient.\r\n\r\n\"As the Christian grows older he appreciates more and more the\r\ncompleteness with which Christ fills the requirements of the heart\r\nand, grateful for the peace which he enjoys and for the strength\r\nwhich he has received, he repeats the words of the great scholar, Sir\r\nWilliam Jones:\r\n\r\n  'Before thy mystic altar, heavenly truth,\r\n  I kneel in manhood, as I knelt in youth.\r\n  Thus let me kneel, till this dull form decay,\r\n  And life's last shade be brightened by thy ray.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\nTHE COLONELS\r\n\r\nA CONVIVIAL MEETING OF LAWYERS--HILARITY SMOTHERED BY THE MAINE\r\nLAW--A FAINTING WAYFARER IS REFUSED A DRINK IN A MAINE VILLAGE--\r\nTHE APOTHECARY DEMANDS A PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION--SNAKE-BITES\r\nIN GREAT DEMAND.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I spent a few weeks of inclement weather in a\r\nbeautiful village in southern Georgia.  Upon calling at his office\r\nto renew my acquaintance with a well-known lawyer, he soon invited\r\nin the remaining members of the local bar.  Everything was propitious,\r\nand the conversation never for a moment flagged, many experiences\r\nof the legal practitioners of the South and of the North being\r\nrelated with happy effect.\r\n\r\nI at length remarked that since my arrival, I had, somewhat to\r\nmy surprise, learned that \"local option\" had been adopted in their\r\ncounty.  An aged brother, in a tone by no means exultant, assured me\r\nthat such was the fact.  I then observed that I was not a hard\r\ndrinker, but being a total stranger and liable to sudden sickness,\r\nI asked what I would do under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nAn equally venerable brother, who bore the unique title of \"Colonel,\"\r\nslowly responded, \"Have to do without, sir, _have to do without;_ not\r\na drop to be had in the county, absolutely not a drop, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe brief silence which followed this announcement was broken by\r\nthe corroborative testimony of a more youthful associate of similar\r\nofficial distinction, and a genial and hospitable expression of\r\ncountenance, somehow suggesting memories of old cognac.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, the use of spirituous liquors is now only a tradition\r\nwith us; but I have heard my father say, that before the war,\r\nthe indulgence in such hospitality was not uncommon among\r\ngentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of still further cumulative testimony of the same\r\ntenor, I remarked that something about the general situation reminded\r\nme of an incident that occurred in a State far to the north while the\r\n\"Maine Law\" was in operation.\r\n\r\nA dilapidated-looking pedestrian, with a pack on his back, early\r\none afternoon of a hot July day pulled up in front of the post-office\r\nin a small village in the interior of Maine.  Humbly addressing\r\na citizen who was just coming out with his copy of the _Weekly\r\nTribune_ in hand, he inquired,\r\n\r\n\"Where can I get a drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Maine Law is in force,\" was the reply, \"and it is impossible for\r\nyou to get a drink in the State.\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of the wayfarer sank within him.\r\n\r\n\"Would you let a man die right here on your streets, for lack of\r\na drink?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"better angel\" of the citizen being touched thereat, he replied,\r\n\r\n\"My friend, I am very sorry for you, but no liquor is ever sold\r\nhere, except by the apothecary, and then only as a medicine.\"\r\n\r\nUpon further inquiry, the important fact was disclosed that the\r\nshop of the apothecary was three-quarters of a mile away, on the\r\nleft-hand side of the road.  With an alacrity indicating something\r\nof hope, the pedestrian immediately gathered up his pack, and\r\nthrough the dust and heat at length reached the designated place.\r\nSinking apparently exhausted upon the door-step, he feebly requested\r\nthe man behind the counter to let him have something to drink.  The\r\nimmediate reply of the apothecary was that the Maine Law was in\r\nforce, and no spirituous liquors could be sold except upon the\r\nprescription of a physician.  After earnest inquiry, it was\r\nascertained that the nearest doctor's office was one mile away,\r\nand the man with the pack again betook himself to the weary highway.\r\nReturning an hour later, in tone more pitiful than before, he begged\r\nthe apothecary, as he hoped for mercy himself, to let him have a\r\ndrink.  Upon inquiry as to whether he had procured the required\r\ncertificate, he said, \"No, the doctor wouldn't give me any.\"\r\n\r\nThe assurance of the apothecary that the case appeared hopeless\r\nonly added to the distress of the poor man, whose sands seemed now\r\nindeed to be running low.\r\n\r\nStirred to the depths by the agony of his visitor, the apothecary at\r\nlength said,\r\n\r\n\"My friend, I would be glad to help you, but it is impossible for me\r\nto let you have a drink of spirituous liquor unless you have a\r\ndoctor's certificate _or have been snake-bit.\"_\r\n\r\nAt the last-mentioned suggestion, the face of the man of\r\nrepeated disappointments measurably brightened, and he eagerly\r\ninquired where he could find a snake.  The now sympathetic man\r\nof bottles told him to follow the main road three miles to the\r\nforks, and then a few hundred yards to the west, and he would find\r\na small grove of decayed tress, where there still lingered a few\r\nsnakes, and by the exercise of a reasonable degree of diligence he\r\nmight manage _to get bit,_ and thereby lay the foundation for\r\nthe desired relief.  With bundle again in place, and evincing a\r\nbuoyancy of manner to which he had been a stranger for many hours,\r\nthe traveller resumed the quest.\r\n\r\nHours later, when the shadows had lengthened, and the fire-flies\r\nwere glistening in the distance,\r\n\r\n  \"With a look so piteous in purport,\r\n  As if he had been loosed out of hell\r\n  To speak of horrors,\"\r\n\r\nhe re-entered the apothecary's shop, threw down his bundle, and in\r\ntones suggestive of the agony of lost souls, again begged for a\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get snake-bit?\" was the feeling inquiry of the man at the\r\nhelm.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the heart-rending reply, _\"every snake I met had engagements\r\nsix months ahead, for all the bites he could furnish!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\nREMINISCENCES\r\n\r\nA BARBECUE AT THE BLUE SPRING, KY.--NOTABLE NATIVES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD\r\n--THE SCHOOLHOUSE CHURCH--SOME OF THE PREACHERS--THE TEACHER OF\r\nSINGING--HOW THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS PAID--MANNERS AND DISCIPLINE--THE\r\nDEBATING SOCIETY--THE WRITER'S SPEECH TO HIS OLD NEIGHBORS--SOME\r\nBOYHOOD FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nSoon after my nomination for the Vice-Presidency, in 1892, I attended\r\na barbecue at the Blue Spring, a stone's throw from my father's\r\nold home in Kentucky.  This was in the county of Christian, in the\r\nsouthwestern part of the State.  It is a large and wealthy county,\r\nits tobacco product probably exceeding that of any other county in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nChristian County was the early home of men distinguished in the\r\nfield, at the bar, and in the State and National councils.\r\nHopkinsville, the county-seat, had been the home of Stites, the\r\nlearned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals; of Jackson, who fell\r\nwhile gallantly leading his command at the battle of Perryville;\r\nof Morehead, an early and distinguished Governor of the Commonwealth;\r\nof Sharp, whose legal acumen would have secured him distinction at\r\nany bar; of McKenzie, whose wit and eloquence made him the long-time\r\nidol and the Representative in Congress, of the famed \"Pennyrile\"\r\ndistrict; of Bristow, the accomplished Secretary of the Treasury\r\nduring the administration of President Grant; of the Henry brothers,\r\nthree of whom, from different States, were at a later day Representatives\r\nin Congress, and one the Whig candidate against Andrew Johnson for\r\nGovernor of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nHon. Gustavus A. Henry, well known as the \"Eagle Orator of Tennessee,\"\r\nwas the Whig candidate for Governor of the State in opposition\r\nto Andrew Johnson, at a later day President of the United States.\r\nThe latter was at the time an old-fashioned, steady-going mountain\r\norator with none of the brilliancy of his gifted antagonist.  At\r\nthe close of a series of joint debates Johnson said:  \"This speech\r\nterminates our joint debates.  I have now encountered the 'Eagle\r\nOrator' upon every stump in the State, and come out of the contest\r\nwith no flesh of mine in his claws--no blood of mine upon his beak.\"\r\nTo which Henry instantly replied:  \"The eagle--the proud bird of\r\nfreedom--never wars upon a corpse!\"\r\n\r\nA few miles from the Blue Spring, in the same county, were the\r\nearly homes of Senator Roger Q. Mills of Texas, Governor John M.\r\nPalmer of Illinois, and Jefferson Davis of the Southern Confederacy.\r\nLess than a score of miles to the southward, upon the banks of the\r\nCumberland in Tennessee, stood historic Fort Donelson; while a few\r\nhours' journey to the northward stands the monument which marks\r\nthe birthplace of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nFollowing the earliest westward trail from Iredell County, North\r\nCarolina, across the Blue Ridge Mountains, for a great distance\r\nalong the banks of the romantic French Broad my grandfathers,\r\n\"Scotch-Irish Presbyterians,\" James Stevenson and Adlai Ewing, with\r\ntheir immediate families and others of their kindred, had in the\r\nearly days of the century, after a long and perilous journey,\r\nfinally reached the famous Spring already mentioned.  Near by,\r\ntheir tents were pitched, and in time permanent homes established in\r\nthe then wilderness of southwestern Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe first public building constructed was of logs, with puncheon\r\nfloor, and set apart to the double purpose of school-house and\r\nchurch for the use of all denominations.  Its site was near the\r\nspot where the speaker's stand was now erected for the barbecue\r\nwhich I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nFrom the pulpit of this rude building, the early settlers had more\r\nthan once listened spell-bound to the eloquence of Peter Cartwright,\r\nHenry B. Bascom, Nathan L. Rice, Finis Ewing, and Alexander\r\nCampbell.\r\n\r\nIn this old church the time-honored custom was for some one of its\r\nofficers to line out the hymn, two lines at a time, and then lead the\r\nsinging, in which the congregation joined.  Among my earliest\r\nrecollections is that of my uncle, Squire McKenzie, one of the best\r\nof men, standing immediately in front of the pulpit, and faithfully\r\ndischarging this important duty after the hymn had been read in\r\nfull by the minister.  I distinctly recall the solemn tones in\r\nwhich, upon communion occasions, he lined out, in measured and\r\nmellow cadence, the good old hymn beginning:\r\n\r\n  \"'T was on that dark, that doleful night,\r\n  When powers of earth and hell arose.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sawyer, too, the old-time singing-school teacher, has honored place\r\nin my memory.  Once a month, in the old church, the singing-school\r\nclass of which we were all members regularly assembled.  The school\r\nwas in four divisions, Bass, Tenor, Counter, and Treble; each member\r\nwas provided with a copy of the \"Missouri Harmony,\" with \"fa,\"\r\n\"sol,\" \"la,\" \"mi,\" appearing in mysterious characters upon every\r\npage; the master, magnifying his office, as with tuning-fork in\r\nhand he stood proudly in the midst, raised the tune, and as it\r\nprogressed smiled or deeply frowned upon each of the divisions\r\nas occasion seemed to require.  His voice has long been hushed,\r\nbut I seem again to hear his cheery command, \"Attention, class!\r\nUtopia, page one hundred!\"\r\n\r\nLooking back through the long vista of years, it is my honest belief\r\nthat such singing as his, at home or abroad, I have never heard.\r\nUpon his tablet might appropriately have been inscribed:\r\n\r\n  \"Sleep undisturbed within this sacred shrine,\r\n  Till angels wake thee with notes like thine.\"\r\n\r\nTo this old field school came in the early time the \"scholars\" for\r\nmany miles around.  It was in very truth the only Alma Mater,\r\nfor that generation, of almost the entire southern portion of\r\nthe county.  My father in his boyhood attended this school, as did\r\nhis kinsmen, John W. and Fielding N. Ewing; the last named of whom\r\nwas, at a much later period, the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church\r\nof Bloomington, Illinois, and his elder brother was the Mayor of\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nAt that early day, and later when I attended the same school, there\r\nwere no salaries provided for the teachers,  The schoolmaster\r\nvisited the families within reasonable distance of the schoolhouse\r\nwith his subscription paper, and the school was duly opened when\r\na sufficient number of pupils had subscribed.\r\n\r\nThe ways of the old field school and the methods of the old-time\r\nteachers belong now to the past.  Once experienced, however,\r\nthey have an abiding place in the memory.  The master, upon his\r\naccustomed perch near the spacious fire-place, with his ever-present\r\nsymbol of authority, the rod--which even Solomon would have considered\r\nfully up to the orthodox standard--in alarming proximity; the boys\r\n\"making their manners\" by scraping the right foot upon the floor\r\nand bowing low as they entered the school-room; the girls upon like\r\noccasions equally faithful in the practice of a bewitching\r\nlittle \"curtsey\" which only added to their charms; the \"studying\r\naloud,\" the hum of the school-room being thereby easily heard a\r\nmile or two away; the timid approach to the dreaded master with\r\nthe humble request that he would \"mend a pen,\" \"parse a verb,\"\r\nor \"do a sum.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour, called recess, was given for the dinner from the\r\nbaskets brought from home, and then the glorious old games, marbles,\r\ntown-ball, and \"bull pen,\" to the heart's content!  At the sound\r\nof the ominous command, \"Books!\" each scholar promptly resumed his\r\nseat, the merry shout of the playground at once giving way to\r\nthe serious business of \"saying lessons.\"  In those good old days,\r\nthe slightest act of omission or commission upon the part of the\r\npupil was confronted with a terrible condition instead of a harmless\r\ntheory.  In very truth the uncomfortable effect of the punishment\r\nunfailingly administered--\"doing his duty to your parents,\" as the petty\r\nschool-room tyrant was wont to observe--was in small degree lessened\r\nby the comforting assurance that the victim \"would thank him for\r\nit the longest day he lived!\"\r\n\r\nThen, to crown all, came the debating society, with the schoolmaster\r\npresiding, and the entire neighborhood, sweethearts and all, in\r\nattendance, and the boys for the first time testing their oratorical\r\npowers.  Vigilant preparations having been made for the discussion\r\nof such momentous questions as:  \"Which deserves the most\r\ncredit, Columbus for discovering America, or Washington for defending\r\nit?\" or \"Which brings the greatest happiness to mankind, pursuit\r\nor possession?\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Georgia Scenes\" is an amusing account of a debate in a backwoods\r\n\"Academy\" nearly a century ago.  The two brightest boys, after\r\nanxious preparation, succeeded in formulating for debate a question\r\nutterly meaningless, but which appeared upon hurried reading to\r\ntouch the very bed-rock of human government.  The \"conspirators\"\r\nmentioned were the respective leaders in the debate which closed the\r\npublic exercises of the annual \"Exhibition\" of the Academy.  The\r\nleaders had made careful preparation for the contest, and appeared\r\nfully to understand the question, and each in turn highly complimented\r\nthe able argument of his rival.  Much amusement was caused by\r\nthe remaining speakers, when called in order, who candidly admitted\r\nthat they didn't understand the question, and patiently submitted\r\nto the fine imposed by the rules of the Society.  That a boy of but\r\nmediocre talents should have failed to participate in the debate, will\r\nnot be considered remarkable when the question is stated:  \"Whether,\r\nin public elections, the vote of faction should prevail by internal\r\nsuggestions, _or the bias of jurisprudence?\"_\r\n\r\nThe late General Gordon related to me the above incident, and added\r\nthat the leaders mentioned were at a later day well known to the\r\ncountry, one the learned Bishop Longstreet of Georgia, the other\r\nthe eloquent Senator McDuffie of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nEvents almost forgotten, forms long since vanished, were vividly\r\nrecalled as, after long absence, I revisited the spot inseparably blended\r\nwith the joyous associations of childhood.  The platform from which\r\nI was to speak had been erected near the ruins of the old church\r\nabove mentioned, of which my grandfather had been a ruling elder, my\r\nfather, mother, and other kindred the earliest members.\r\n\r\nUpon my introduction to the vast assemblage--the good things\r\nsuggested by \"barbecue\" having meanwhile given to all an abundant feeling\r\nof contentment--I began by brief reference to the pleasure I\r\nexperienced in again visiting, after the passing of the years which\r\nseparated childhood from middle age, scenes once so familiar,\r\nand meeting face to face so many of my early associates and friends,\r\nand remarked, that in the early days in Illinois the not unusual\r\nreply of the Kentucky emigrant, when asked what part of the Old\r\nCommonwealth he came from was, \"From the Blue Grass,\" or \"From near\r\nLexington,\" but that my invariable answer to that inquiry had even\r\nbeen, \"From the Pennyrile!\"\r\n\r\nSome mention I made of Mr. Caskie, the dreaded school-master of\r\nthe long ago, caused a momentary commotion in the audience, and\r\nimmediately a man of white hairs and bowed by the weight of more\r\nthan fourscore years, was lifted to the front of the platform.\r\nWith arm about my neck, he earnestly inquired:  \"Adlai, I came\r\ntwenty miles to hear you speak; don't you remember me?\"  The audience\r\napparently appreciated the instant reply:  \"Yes, Mr. Caskie, _I\r\nstill have a few marks left to remember you by!\"_\r\n\r\nThe venerable and long ago forgiven schoolmaster was fearfully\r\ndeaf, and to prevent the possibility of a single word escaping him,\r\nhe stood close beside me, and with his hand behind his ear and the\r\nother resting tenderly on my shoulder, faithfully followed me in\r\nmy journeyings to and fro across the stage during the two-hours'\r\nspeech which followed.\r\n\r\nMy speech at length concluded, I was warmly greeted by scores of\r\nold neighbors and friends.  Just forty years had passed since my\r\nfather had removed his family to Illinois, and it may well be\r\nbelieved that it was difficult to recall promptly all the names\r\nand faces of those I had known in childhood.  Even a candidate has,\r\nat such times, \"some rights under the Constitution\"; one of which,\r\nI honestly believe, is total exemption from the tormenting\r\ninquiries:  \"Do you know me?  Well, what is my name?\"  The laurels,\r\neven of Job, had he ever been a candidate, would probably have\r\nturned to willows.\r\n\r\nI am here reminded of an experience of one of my early competitors\r\nfor Congress.  It was his happy forte to remember instantly all\r\nhis old acquaintances; not only that, but to know their full names.\r\nTo call out in friendly and familiar tone, in and out of season,\r\n\"Bill,\" \"Dick,\" \"Sam,\" \"Bob,\" a hundred times a day, was as natural\r\nto him as to breathe.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, however, the fates seemed slightly untoward.\r\nAt the close of one of our joint debates, in the southern part\r\nof the district, he was greeted by a demure-looking individual with\r\nthe salutation, \"How are you, Judge?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" exclaimed the regular candidate, grasping the\r\ninterrogator warmly by the hand, \"how are you, and how is the\r\nold lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not married, Judge,\" was the deliberate response, as of\r\none assuming the entire responsibility.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not, certainly not, my dear sir; I meant you mother.\r\nHow is that excellent old lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother has been dead twenty years, Judge,\" was the mournful\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nA trifle embarrassed, but not entirely off his base, the judge\r\nlooked earnestly into the face of the bereaved, and said:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, excuse me, your countenance is perfectly familiar to\r\nme, but I do not at this moment remember exactly who you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe response was, \"Judge, _I am an evangelist.\"_\r\n\r\nTo which the candidate for Congress, now upon a firm footing, tapped\r\nthe man of the sacred office familiarly upon the shoulder and\r\ncheerfully exclaimed, \"Why, damn it, _Van,_ I thought I ought to\r\nknow you!\"\r\n\r\nReturning now for brief sojourn to the afore-mentioned barbecue,\r\nwith a faithful kinsman as monitor, aided by a slight moiety of\r\ntact to be credited to personal account, I managed passably well\r\nto get through the trying ordeal.  \"The old gentleman with the long\r\nwhite beard, coming toward us,\" observed my monitor, \"is Uncle Jake\r\nAnderson.  He has a hat bet that you will know him.\"  Thus advised,\r\nI was ready for trial, and warmly grasping the hand extended me,\r\nI earnestly inquired, \"Uncle Jake, _how are you?\"_  \"Do you know\r\nme, boy?\" was the immediate response.  \"Know you?\" I replied.  \"You\r\nand my father were near neighbors for years; how could I help\r\nknowing you?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" he said, \"but you being gone so\r\nlong, and now running for President, I didn't know but what you\r\nhad forgotten all about the old neighbors down on the Lick.\"\r\nAssuring him that I had forgotten none of them, and congratulating\r\nhim upon the hat he had won, I passed on to the next.\r\n\r\nThe interview described was repeated with slight variations,\r\nmany times, when my attendant remarked:\r\n\r\n\"That man leaning against the tree is John Dunloe; do you remember\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I replied, \"I went to school with him.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately approaching my early classmate I took him by the hand and\r\nsaid, \"How are you, John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Adlai, do you know me?\" was the prompt response.\r\n\r\n\"Know you,\" said I, \"didn't we go to school together to Mr. Caskie\r\nright here at Blue Water, when we were boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas, of course we did,\" slowly answered by sometime school-fellow,\r\n\"but you been 'sociatin' with them big fellows down about Washington\r\nso long, that I didn't know but what you had forgot us poor fellows\r\ndown in the Pennyrile.\"\r\n\r\nAssuring him that I never forgot my old friends, I inquired, \"John,\r\nwhere is your brother Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's here,\" was the instant reply.  \"Me and Bill started before\r\ndaylight to get to this barbecue in time.  Bill 'lowed _he'd ruther\r\ngo forty miles on foot to hear you make a speech, than go to a\r\nhangin'.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\nA TRIBUTE TO IRELAND*\r\n\r\n[*Footnote: Speech delivered by Mr. Stevenson at a banquet of\r\nthe United Irish Societies of Chicago, September, 1900.]\r\n\r\nTHE WRITER'S VISIT TO NOTABLE PLACES IN IRELAND--HIS TRIBUTE OF\r\nPRAISE TO HER GREAT MEN--AMERICA'S OBLIGATION TO IRISH SOLDIERS\r\nAND STATESMEN.\r\n\r\nI accepted with pleasure the invitation to meet with you.  For the\r\ncourtesy so generously extended me I am profoundly grateful.\r\n\r\nWithin late years it has been my privilege to visit Ireland; and\r\nI can truly say that no country in Europe possessed for me a deeper\r\ninterest than the little island about whose name clusters so much of\r\nromance and of enchantment.  I saw Ireland in its beauty and its\r\ngloom; in its glory and in its desolation.  I stood upon the Giant's\r\nCauseway, one of the grand masterpieces of the Almighty; I visited\r\nthe historic parks and deserted legislative halls of venerated\r\nDublin; threaded the streets and byways of the quaint old city\r\nof Cork; listened the bells of Shandon; sailed over the beautiful\r\nlakes of Killarney, and gazed upon the old castles of Muckross and\r\nof Blarney, whose ivy-covered ruins tell of the far-away centuries.\r\nWhat a wonderful island!  The birthplace of wits, of warriors,\r\nof statesmen, of poets, and of orators.  Of its people it has been\r\ntruly said:  \"They have fought successfully the battles of every\r\ncountry but their own.\"\r\n\r\nUpon occasion such as this, the Irishman--to whatever spot in this\r\nwide world he may have wandered--lives in the shadow of the past.\r\nIn imagination he is once more under the ancestral roof; the\r\nvine-clad cottage is again a thing of reality.  Again he wears the\r\nshamrock; again he hears the songs of his native land, while his\r\nheart is stirred by memories of her wrongs and of her glory.\r\n\r\nWhat a splendid contribution Ireland has made to the world's galaxy\r\nof great men!  In the realm of poetry, Goldsmith and Tom Moore; of\r\noratory, Sheridan, Emmett, Grattan, O'Connell, Burke, and in later\r\nyears Charles Stewart Parnell, whose thrilling words I heard a\r\nthird of a century ago, pleading the cause of his oppressed\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThe obligation of America to Ireland for men who have aided in\r\nfighting her battles and framing her laws cannot be measured by\r\nwords.  In the British possessions to the northward, in the old\r\ncity of Quebec, there is one spot dear to the American heart--that\r\nwhere fell the brave Montgomery, fighting the battles of his adopted\r\ncountry.  What schoolboy is not familiar with the story of gallant\r\nPhil Sheridan and \"Winchester twenty miles away?\"  Illinoisans will\r\nnever forget Shields, the hero of two wars, the senator from three\r\nStates.  It was an Irish-American poet of a neighboring State\r\nwho wrote of our fallen soldiers words that will live while we have\r\na country and a language:\r\n\r\n  \"The muffled drum's sad roll has beat\r\n  The soldier's last tattoo;\r\n  No more of life's parade shall meet\r\n  That brave and fallen few.\"\r\n\r\nThe achievements of representatives of this race along every pathway\r\nof useful and honorable endeavor are a part of our own history.\r\nWe honor to-day the far-away island, the deeds and sacrifices of\r\nwhose sons have added so brilliant a chapter to American history.\r\nFrom the assembling of the First Continental Congress to the present\r\nhour, in every legislative hall the Irishman has been a factor.\r\nHis bones have whitened every American battlefield from the first\r\nconflict with British regulars to the closing hour of our struggle\r\nwith Spain.\r\n\r\nThe love of liberty is deeply ingrained into the very life of\r\nthe Irishman.  The history of his country is that of a gallant\r\npeople struggling for a larger measure of freedom.  His most precious\r\nheritage is the record of his countrymen, who upon the battlefield\r\nand upon the scaffold have sealed their devotion to liberty with\r\ntheir blood.  With such men it was a living faith that--\r\n\r\n  \"Whether on the scaffold high\r\n  Or in the battle's van\r\n  The fittest place for man to die\r\n  Is where he dies for man.\"\r\n\r\nWith a history reaching into the far past, every page of which\r\ntells of the struggle for liberty, it is not strange that the\r\nsympathies of the Irishman are with the oppressed everywhere on\r\nGod's footstool.  Irishmen, in common with liberty-loving men\r\neverywhere, looked with abhorrence upon the attempt of a great\r\nEuropean power to establish monarchy upon the ruins of republics.\r\n\r\nMay we not confidently abide in the hope that brighter days are in\r\nwaiting for the beautiful island and her gallant people?  I close with\r\nthe words:  \"God bless old Ireland!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\nTHE BLIND CHAPLAIN\r\n\r\nDR. MILBURN'S SOLEMNITY IN PRAYER--HIS VENERABLE APPEARANCE--HIS\r\nCONVERSATIONAL POWERS--HIS CUSTOM OF PRAYING FOR SICK MEMBERS.\r\n\r\nNo Senator who ever sat under the ministrations of Dr. Milburn,\r\nthe blind chaplain, can ever forget his earnest and solemn invocation.\r\nWhen rolling from his tongue, each word of the Lord's Prayer seemed\r\nto weigh a pound.  His venerable appearance and sightless eyes gave\r\na tinge of pathetic emphasis to his every utterance.  He was a man\r\nof rare gifts; in early life, before the entire failure of his\r\nsight, he had known much of active service in his sacred calling\r\nupon the Western circuits.  He had been the fellow-laborer of\r\nCartwright, Bascom, and other eminent Methodist ministers of the\r\nearly times.\r\n\r\nDr. Milburn was the Chaplain of the House during the Mexican War, and\r\noften a guest at the Executive Mansion when Mr. Polk was President.\r\nHe knew well many of the leading statesmen of that period.  He\r\npossessed rare conversational powers; and notwithstanding his\r\nblindness, poverty, and utter loneliness, he remained the pleasing,\r\nentertaining gentleman to the last.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of the good Chaplain, with the aid of a faithful\r\nmonitor, to keep thoroughly advised as to the health of the senators\r\nand their families.  The bare mention, in the morning paper, of\r\nany ill having befallen any statesman of whom he was, for the time,\r\nthe official spiritual shepherd, was the unfailing precursor of\r\nspecial and affectionate mention at the next convening of the\r\nSenate.  Moreover, in the discharge of this sacred duty, his\r\ninvariable habit was to designate the object of his special invocation\r\nas \"the Senior Senator\" or \"Junior Senator,\" carefully giving\r\nthe name of his State.  It is within the realm of probability that\r\nsince the first humble petition was breathed, there has never been\r\nan apparently more prompt answer to prayer than that now to be\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n_The Morning Post_ contained an item to the effect that Senator\r\nVoorhees was ill.  During the accustomed invocation which preceded\r\nthe opening of the session, an earnest petition ascended for\r\n\"the Senior Senator from Indiana,\" that he might \"soon be restored\r\nto his wonted health, and permitted to return to the seat so long and\r\nso honorably occupied.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later, the touching invocation being ended, and the Senate\r\nduly in session, the stately form of \"the Senior Senator from\r\nIndiana\" promptly emerged from the cloak-room, and quietly resumed\r\nthe seat he had \"so long and so honorably occupied.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\nA MEMORABLE CENTENNIAL\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON LAYING THE CORNER-STONE OF THE CAPITOL--PROGRESS\r\nOF THE REPUBLIC DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY--NOTABLE MEN WHO WERE\r\nCONSPICUOUS AT THE NATION'S BIRTH--CONGRESS HELD AT VARIOUS PLACES\r\nBEFORE 1800--THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FORMED--NECESSITY FOR ENLARGING\r\nTHE CAPITOL AT WASHINGTON--A DOCUMENT BY WEBSTER DEPOSITED BENEATH\r\nTHE CORNER-STONE OF THE ADDITIONS--HIGH DEBATES HELD IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES SENATE--PRESENT LOCATION OF THE SENATE CHAMBER--GREAT INCREASE\r\nOF POPULATION, TERRITORY, AND COMMERCE--THE TWO DIVISIONS OF\r\nCONGRESS.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth day of September, 1893, the first centennial\r\nof the laying of the corner-stone of the national Capitol was\r\ncelebrated by appropriate ceremonies in Washington City.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland presided, and seated upon the platform were\r\nthe members of his Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives,\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, and the Foreign Ambassadors.\r\n\r\nThe oration was delivered by the Hon. William Wirt Henry, of\r\nRichmond, Virginia, grandson of Patrick Henry.  The addresses which\r\nfollowed were by myself, representing the Senate; Speaker Crisp,\r\nrepresenting the House; and Justice Brown, the Supreme Court.  I\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This day and this hour mark the close of a century of our national\r\nhistory.  No ordinary event has called us together.  Standing in\r\nthe presence of this august assemblage of the people, upon the spot\r\nwhere Washington stood, we solemnly commemorate the one-hundredth\r\nanniversary of the laying of the corner-stone of the nation's Capitol.\r\n\r\n\"It is well that this day has been set apart as a national holiday,\r\nthat all public business has been suspended, and that the President\r\nand his Cabinet, the members of the great Court, and of the Congress,\r\nunite with their countrymen in doing honor to the memory of the\r\nmen who, one hundred years ago, at this hour, and upon this spot, put\r\nin place the corner-stone of the Capitol of the American Republic.\r\nThe century rolls back, and we stand in the presence of the grandest\r\nand most imposing figure known to any age or country.  Washington,\r\nas Grand Master of Free and Accepted Masons, clothed in the symbolic\r\ngarments of that venerable Order, wearing the apron and the sash\r\nwrought by the hands of the wife of the beloved Lafayette, impressively\r\nand in accordance with the time-honored usages of that Order, is\r\nlaying his hands upon the corner-stone of the future and permanent\r\nCapitol of his country.  The solemn ceremonies of the hour were\r\nconducted by Washington, not only in his office of Grand Master of\r\nFree Masons, but in his yet more august office of President of the\r\nUnited States.  Assisting him in the fitting observance of these\r\nimpressive rites, were representatives of the Masonic Lodges of\r\nVirginia and Maryland, while around him stood men whose honored\r\nnames live with his in history--the men who, on field and in council,\r\nhad aided first in achieving independence, and then in the yet more\r\ndifficult task of garnering, by wise legislation, the fruits of\r\nvictory.  Truly, the centennial of an event so fraught with interest\r\nshould not pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\"History furnishes no parallel to the century whose close we now\r\ncommemorate.  Among all the centuries it stands alone.  With hearts\r\nfilled with gratitude to the God of our fathers, it is well that\r\nwe recall something of the progress of the young Republic, since\r\nthe masterful hour when Washington laid his hands upon the\r\nfoundation-stone of yonder Capitol.\r\n\r\n\"The seven years of colonial struggle for liberty had terminated\r\nin glorious victory.  Independence had been achieved.  The Articles\r\nof Confederation, binding the Colonies together in a mere league\r\nof friendship, had given place to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates--that wonderful instrument, so aptly declared by Mr. Gladstone\r\nto be 'the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by\r\nthe brain and purpose of man.'\r\n\r\n\"Without a dissenting voice in the Electoral Colleges, Washington had\r\nbeen chosen President.  At his council-table sat Jefferson, the\r\nauthor of the Declaration of Independence; Hamilton, of whom it\r\nhas been said, 'He smote the rock of the national resources, and\r\nabundant streams of revenue gushed forth.  He touched the dead\r\ncorpse of the public credit, and it sprung upon its feet'; Knox, the\r\nbrave and trusted friend of his chief during the colonial struggle;\r\nand Edmund Randolph, the impress of whose genius has been indelibly\r\nleft upon the Federal Constitution.  Vermont and Kentucky, as\r\nsovereign States--coequal with the original thirteen--had been\r\nadmitted into the Union.  The Supreme Court, consisting of six\r\nmembers, had been constituted, with the learned jurist John Jay\r\nas its Chief Justice.  The popular branch of the Congress consisted\r\nof but one hundred and five members.  Thirty members constituted\r\nthe Senate, over whose deliberations presided the patriot statesman,\r\nJohn Adams.  The population of the entire country was less than\r\nfour millions.  The village of Washington, the capital--and I trust\r\nfor all coming ages the capital--contained but a few hundred\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"After peace had been concluded with Great Britain, and while we\r\nwere yet under the Articles of Confederation, the sessions of\r\nthe Congress were held successively at Princeton, Annapolis, Trenton,\r\nand New York.  In the presence of both houses of Congress, on\r\nthe thirtieth day of April, 1789, in the city of New York, Washington\r\nhad been inaugurated President.  From that hour--the beginning\r\nof our Government under the Constitution--the Congress was held in\r\nNew York, until 1790, then in Philadelphia until 1800, when, on\r\nNovember 17, it first convened in Washington.  The necessity of\r\nselecting a suitable and central place for the permanent location of\r\nthe seat of Government early engaged the thoughtful consideration of\r\nour fathers.  It cannot be supposed that the question reached a\r\nfinal determination without great embarrassment, earnest discussion,\r\nand the manifestation of sectional jealousies.  But, as has been\r\nwell said, the good genius of our system finally prevailed, 'and\r\na district of territory on the River Potomac, at some place between\r\nthe mouths of the Eastern branch and the Conococheague,' was, by\r\nAct of Congress of June 28, 1790, 'accepted for the permanent seat\r\nof the Government of the United States.'  From the seventeenth day\r\nof November, 1800, this city has been the capital.  When that\r\nday came, Washington had gone to his grave, John Adams was President,\r\nand Jefferson the presiding officer of the Senate.  It may be well\r\nto recall that upon the occasion of the assembling for the first\r\ntime of the Congress in the Capitol, President Adams appeared before\r\nthe Senate and the House, in joint session, and said:\r\n\r\n\"'It would be unbecoming the representatives of this nation to\r\nassemble for the first time in this solemn temple, without looking\r\nup to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe and imploring His blessing.\r\nYou will consider it as the capital of a great nation, advancing\r\nwith unexampled rapidity in arts, in commerce, in wealth, and\r\npopulation, and possessing within itself those resources which, if\r\nnot thrown away or lamentably misdirected, will secure it a long\r\ncourse of prosperity and self-government.'\r\n\r\n\"To this address of President Adams the Senate made reply:\r\n\r\n\"'We meet you, sir, and the other branch of the national Legislature,\r\nin the city which is honored by the name of our late hero and sage,\r\nthe illustrious Washington, with sensations and emotions which\r\nexceed our power of description.'\r\n\r\n\"From the date last given until the burning of the Capitol by\r\nthe British, in 1814, in the room now occupied by the Supreme Court\r\nLibrary, in the north wing, were held the sessions of the Senate.\r\nThat now almost forgotten apartment witnessed the assembling of\r\nSenators who, at an earlier period of our history, had been the\r\nassociates of Washington and Franklin, and had themselves played\r\nno mean part in crystallizing into the great organic law, the\r\ndeathless principles of the Declaration of Independence.  From this\r\nchamber went forth the second Declaration of War against Great\r\nBritain; and here, before the Senate as a court of impeachment,\r\nwas arraigned a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nto answer the charge of alleged high crimes and misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n\"With the rolling years and the rapid growth of the Republic, came\r\nthe imperative necessity for enlarging its Capitol.  The debates\r\nupon this subject culminated in the Act of Congress of September\r\n30, 1850, providing for the erection of the north and south wings of\r\nthe Capitol.  Thomas U. Walter was the architect to whose hand was\r\ncommitted the great work.  Yonder noble structure will stand for\r\nages the silent witness of the fidelity with which the important\r\ntrust was discharged.\r\n\r\n\"The corner-stone of the additions was laid by President Fillmore,\r\non the fourth day of July, 1851.  In honor of that event, and by\r\nrequest of the President, Mr. Webster pronounced an oration, and\r\nwhile we have a country and a language his words will touch a\r\nresponsive chord in patriotic hearts.  Beneath the corner-stone\r\nwas then deposited a paper, in the handwriting of Mr. Webster,\r\ncontaining the following words:\r\n\r\n\"'If it shall be, hereafter, the will of God, that this structure\r\nshall fall from its base, that its foundation be upturned and this\r\ndeposit brought to the eyes of men, be it then known that on this day\r\nthe Union of the United States of America stands firm, that\r\ntheir Constitution still exists unimpaired, with all its\r\noriginal usefulness and glory, growing every day stronger and\r\nstronger in the affections of the great body of the American people,\r\nand attracting more and more the attention of the world.  And all\r\nhere assembled, whether belonging to public life or to private\r\nlife, with hearts devoutly thankful to Almighty God for the\r\npreservation of the liberty and happiness of the country, unite in\r\nsincere and fervent prayers that this deposit, and the walls and\r\narches, the domes and towers, the columns and entablatures now\r\nto be erected over it, may endure forever.'\r\n\r\n\"From the sixth day of December, 1819, until January 4, 1859, a\r\nperiod of thirty-nine years, the sessions of the Senate were held\r\nin the present Supreme Court room.  This was, indeed, the arena of\r\nhigh debate.  When, in any age, or in any country, has there\r\nbeen gathered, within so small compass, so much of human greatness?\r\nEven to suggest the great questions here discussed and determined,\r\nwould be to write a history of that eventful period.  It was,\r\nindeed, the coming together of the master spirits of the second\r\ngeneration of American statesmen.  Here were Macon and Crawford,\r\nBenton, Randolph, Cass, Bell, Houston, Preston, Buchanan, Seward, Chase,\r\nCrittenden, Sumner, Choate, Everett, Breese, Trumbull, Fessenden, Douglas,\r\nClay, Calhoun, Webster, and others scarcely less illustrious.\r\nWithin the walls of that little chamber was heard the wondrous\r\ndebate between Hayne and Webster.  There began the fierce conflict\r\nof antagonistic ideas touching the respective powers of the State and\r\nof the Nation--a conflict which, transferred to a different theatre,\r\nfound final solution only in the bloody arbitrament of arms.\r\n\r\n\"For more than a third of a century the sessions of the Senate have\r\nbeen held in the magnificent chamber of the north wing of the\r\nCapitol.  Of the procession of sixty-two Senators that, preceded\r\nby the Vice-President, Mr. Breckenridge, entered the Chamber for\r\nthe first time, on the fourth day of January, 1859, but four survive;\r\nnot one remains in public life.  It is, indeed, now a procession of\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n\"When the foundation-stone of this Capitol was laid, our Republic was\r\nin its infancy, and self-government yet an untried experiment.  It\r\nis a proud reflection to-day that time has proved the true arbiter,\r\nand that the capacity of a free and intelligent people to govern\r\nthemselves by written constitution and laws, of their own making, is\r\nno longer an experiment.  The crucial test of a century of\r\nunparalleled material prosperity has been safely endured.\r\n\r\n\"In 1793 there was no city west of the Alleghanies.  To-day a single\r\ncity on Lake Michigan contains a population of a little less\r\nthan one-half of the Republic at the time of the first inauguration\r\nof Washington.  States have been carved out of the wilderness, and\r\nour great rivers, whose silence met no break on their pathway to\r\nthe sea, are now the arteries of our interior trade, and bear upon\r\ntheir bosoms a commerce which surpasses a hundred-fold that of the\r\nentire country a century ago.\r\n\r\n\"From fifteen States and four millions of people, we have grown to\r\nfifty States and Territories, and sixty-seven millions of people; from\r\nan area of eight hundred and five thousand, to an area of three\r\nmillion, six hundred thousand square miles; from a narrow strip\r\nalong the Atlantic seaboard, to an unbroken possession from ocean to\r\nocean.  How marvellous the increase in our national wealth!  In\r\n1793, our imports amounted to thirty-one million, and our exports to\r\ntwenty-six million dollars.  Now our imports are eight hundred and\r\nforty-seven million, and our exports one billion and thirty million\r\ndollars.  Thirty-three million tons of freight are carried on\r\nour Great Lakes, whose only burden then was the Indian's canoe.\r\nThen our national wealth was inconsiderable; now our assessed\r\nvaluation amounts to the enormous sum of twenty-four billion,\r\nsix hundred and fifty million dollars.  Then trade and travel were\r\ndependent upon beasts of burden and on sailing vessels; now steam and\r\nelectricity do our bidding, railroads cover the land, boats burden\r\nthe waters, the telegraph reaches every city and hamlet; distance\r\nis annihilated, and\r\n\r\n  \"'Civilization, on her luminous wings,\r\n  Soars, Phoenix-like, to Jove.'\r\n\r\n\"In the presence of this wondrous fulfillment of predicted greatness,\r\nprophecy looks out upon the future and stands dumb.\r\n\r\n\"When this corner-stone was laid, France, then in the throes of\r\na revolution, had just declared war against Great Britain--a war\r\nin which all Europe eventually became involved.  Within a century of\r\nthat hour, in the capital of France, there convened an international\r\ncourt, its presiding officer an eminent citizen of the French\r\nRepublic, its members representatives of sovereign European States,\r\nits object the peaceable adjustment of controversies between Great\r\nBritain and the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Was it Richelieu who said, 'Take away the sword; States can be\r\nsaved without it'?\r\n\r\n\"In no part of our mechanism of government was the wisdom of our\r\nfathers more strikingly displayed than in the division of power\r\ninto the three great departments--legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial.  In an equal degree was that wisdom manifested by the\r\ndivision of Congress into a Senate and a House of Representatives.\r\nUpon the Senate the Constitution has devolved important functions other\r\nthan those of a merely legislative character.  Coequal with the\r\nHouse in matters of legislation, it is, in addition, the advisory\r\nbody of the President in appointments to office, and in treating\r\nwith foreign nations.  The mode of election, together with the long\r\nterm of service, unquestionably fosters a spirit of conservatism\r\nin the Senate.  Always organized, it is the continuing body of our\r\nnational legislature.  Its members change, but the Senate continues\r\n--the same now as at the first hour of the Republic.  Before no\r\nhuman tribunal come for determination issues of weightier moment.\r\nIt were idle to doubt that problems yet lie in our pathway as a\r\nnation, as difficult of solution as any that in times past have\r\ntried the courage or tested the wisdom of our fathers.  Yet, may\r\nwe not confidently abide in the faith that in the keeping of those\r\nwho succeed the illustrious sages I have named, the dearest interest\r\nof our country will be faithfully conserved, and in the words of\r\nan eminent predecessor, 'though these marble walls moulder into\r\nruin, the Senate, in another age, may bear into a new and large\r\nchamber the Constitution, vigorous and inviolate, and that the last\r\ngeneration of posterity shall witness the deliberations of the\r\nrepresentatives of American States, still united, prosperous,\r\nand free'?\r\n\r\n\"And may our fathers' God, 'from out of whose hand the centuries\r\nfall like grains of sand,' continue to the American people, throughout\r\nall the ages, the prosperity and blessings which He has given to\r\nus in the past.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\nCOLUMBUS MONUMENT IN CENTRAL PARK\r\n\r\nFITNESS OF NEW YORK AS THE SITE FOR THE STATUE--VAST IMPORTANCE OF\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA--COLUMBUS'S HUMILITY AND HIS TRUST IN GOD\r\n--THE STATUE UNVEILED--CONCLUDING WORDS OF MR. DEPEW'S ORATION.\r\n\r\nFacing the statue of Shakespeare in Central Park, New York, is that\r\nof Christopher Columbus.  It was unveiled with appropriate ceremonies.\r\nGeneral James Grant Wilson presided; Mrs. Julia Ward Howe read her\r\nbeautiful poem, \"The Mariner's Dream,\" and the oration was delivered\r\nby the Hon. Chauncey Depew.  Upon this occasion I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This hour will live in history.  Central Park, beautiful and\r\nmagnificent, is the fitting place for the statue of Columbus.\r\nIt is well that to the City of New York, the metropolis of the\r\ncontinent, should have fallen the grateful task of portraying to\r\nthe millions of all the coming ages the features of the man who,\r\ndespite obstacles and dangers, marked out the pathway to the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n\"The name and fame of Columbus belong exclusively to no age or\r\ncountry.  They are the enduring heritage of all people.  Your\r\nPresident has truly said:  'In all the transactions of history,\r\nthere is no act which, for vastness and performance, can be compared\r\nto the discovery of the continent of America.'  In the modest words\r\nof the great navigator, he 'only opened the gates'; and lo! there came\r\nin the builders of a new and mighty nation.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that in Venice there is sacredly preserved a letter\r\nwritten by Columbus a few hours before he sailed from Palos.  With\r\nreverent expression of trust in God, humbly, but with unfaltering faith,\r\nhe spoke of his proposed voyage to that famous land.  He builded\r\nbetter than he knew.  His dream, while a suppliant in the outer\r\nchambers of kings, and while keeping lonely vigil on the deep, was\r\nthe discovery of a new pathway to the Indies.  Yet who can doubt\r\nthat to his prophetic soul was then foreshadowed something of that\r\nfamous land with the warp and woof of whose history, tradition,\r\nand song, his name and fame are linked for all time?  Was it Mr.\r\nWinthrop who said of Columbus and his compeers:  'They were the\r\npioneers in the march to independence; the precursors in the\r\nonly progress of freedom which was to have no backward steps.'\r\n\r\n\"Is it too much to say of this man that among the world's benefactors\r\na greater than he hath not appeared?  What page in our history\r\ntells of deeds so fraught with blessings to the generations of men\r\nas the discovery of America?  Columbus added a continent to the\r\nmap of the world.\r\n\r\n\"I will detain you no longer.  Your eyes will now behold this\r\nsplendid work of art.  It is well that its approaches are firm and\r\nbroad, for along this pathway, with the rolling centuries, will\r\ncome, as pilgrims to a shrine, the myriads of all lands to behold this\r\nstatue of Columbus, this enduring monument of the gratitude of a\r\ngreat city, of a great nation.\"\r\n\r\nAs the last words were spoken, I leaned over and grasped the\r\nrope fastened to the flag that enveloped the statue.  The flag\r\nparted on either side and was removed by the attendants.  The statue\r\nstood revealed in all its beauty under the shade of the great elms\r\nof the Mall.\r\n\r\nMr. Depew concluded his eloquent oration with the following words:\r\n\r\n\"We are here to erect this statue to his memory because of the\r\nunnumbered blessings to America and to the people of every race\r\nand clime which have followed his discovery.  His genius and faith\r\ngave succeeding generations the opportunity for life and liberty.\r\nWe, the heirs of all the ages, in the plenitude of our enjoyments,\r\nand the prodigality of the favors showered upon us, hail Columbus our\r\nbenefactor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\nA PLATFORM NOT DANGEROUS TO STAND UPON\r\n\r\nA CITIZEN WHO LONGED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE MISSOURI LEGISLATURE--A\r\nCOMMITTEE APPOINTED BY A MEETING OF HIS FRIENDS--DIFFICULTY IN\r\nARRANGING THE PLATFORM--THE RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY.\r\n\r\nThe builders of political platforms, which uniformly \"point with\r\npride\" and \"view with alarm,\" may possibly glean a valuable suggestion\r\nfrom the following incident related by Governor Knott.  In the\r\ncounty in the good State of Missouri in which his fortune was cast\r\nfor a while, there lived and flourished, in the ante-bellum days,\r\none Solomon P. Rodes, whose earnest and long-continued yearning\r\nwas to be a member of the State Legislature.  So intense, indeed, had\r\nthis feeling become in the mind of Solomon, that he at length openly\r\ndeclared that he \"would rather go to the Missouri Legislater, than\r\nto be the Czar of Roosky.\"  And in passing, it may here be\r\nsafely admitted that even a wiser man than Solomon might make this\r\ndeclaration in these early years of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of greater men than himself when aspiring to\r\npublic office, Mr. Rodes called a meeting of his party friends\r\nin his precinct, to the end that his modest \"boom\" might be\r\nsuccessfully launched.  After the accustomed organization had been\r\neffected, a committee of five, of which our aspirant was chairman,\r\nwas duly appointed to prepare and present appropriate resolutions.\r\nThe committee at once retired for consultation, to a log in the\r\nrear of the schoolhouse, leaving the convention in session.  No\r\nrattling orator being present to arouse the enthusiasm so essential\r\nto patient waiting, the little assemblage, wearied by the delay,\r\nat length despatched a messenger to expedite, if possible, the\r\nlabors of the committee.  The messenger found the committee in a\r\ncondition far otherwise than encouraging.  The resolutions had\r\nfailed to materialize, and the chairman, seated upon the log, with\r\npencil in hand, and gazing pensively upon a blank leaf before him,\r\nseemed the very picture of despair.  Upon a second admonition from\r\nthe unreasonably impatient meeting, that adjournment would\r\nimmediately take place unless the resolutions were reported, the\r\ncommittee hastily concluded its labors and, preceded by the chairman\r\nwith document in hand, solemnly returned to the place of assembly.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions, two in number, and unanimously and with great\r\nenthusiasm promptly adopted, were in words and figures as follows,\r\nto-wit:\r\n\r\n\"(1) Resolv that in the declaration of independence and likewise\r\nalso in the constitution of the united states, we recognize _a able\r\nand well ritten document,_ and that we are tetotually oppose to\r\nthe repeal of airy one of the aforesaid instruments of riting.\r\nResolv:\r\n\r\n\"(2) that in our fellow-townsman, Solomon P. Rodes, we view a onest\r\nman and _hereby annominate him for the legislater.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\nANECDOTES OF GOVERNOR OGLESBY\r\n\r\nOGLESBY'S GREATNESS IN DISCUSSING QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE\r\nREBELLION--HIS WORK IN THE MEXICAN AND CIVIL WARS--HE VISITS THE\r\nORIENT--FAILS TO FIND OUT WHO BUILT THE PYRAMIDS.\r\n\r\nFew men have enjoyed a greater degree of popularity than did the\r\nlate Governor Oglesby of Illinois.  He was whole-souled, genial,\r\nand at all times the most delightful of companions.  He stood in\r\nthe front rank of campaign orators when slavery, rebellion, war, and\r\nreconstruction were the stirring questions of the hour.  In the\r\ndiscussion of these once vital issues, with the entire State for\r\nan audience, he was without a peer.  But when they were relegated to\r\nthe domain of history and succeeded by tariff, finance, and\r\nother commonplace, everyday questions, the Governor felt greatly\r\nhampered.  In a large degree Othello's occupation was gone.\r\nCold facts, statistics, figures running up into the millions, gave\r\nlittle opportunity for the play of his wonderful imagination.\r\n\r\nIn his second race for Governor, in a speech at Bloomington, he\r\nsaid, in a deprecatory tone:  \"These Democrats undertake to discuss\r\nthe financial question.  They oughtn't to do that.  They can't\r\npossibly understand it.  The Lord's truth is, fellow-citizens, _it\r\nis about all we Republicans can do to understand that question!\"_\r\n\r\nHe was a gallant soldier in the Mexican and in the great Civil War,\r\nand in the latter achieved distinction as a commanding officer.\r\nWith Weldon, Ewing, McNulta, Fifer, Rowell, and others as listeners,\r\nhe once graphically described the first battle in which he was\r\nengaged.  Turning to his old-time comrade, McNulta, he said:  \"There\r\nis one supreme moment in the experience of a soldier that is\r\nabsolutely ecstatic!\"  \"That,\" quickly replied McNulta, \"is the very\r\nmoment when he gets into battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, damn it,\" said Oglesby, _\"it is the very moment he gets out!\"_\r\n\r\nIn his early manhood, Oglesby spent some years abroad.  His pilgrimage\r\nextended even to Egypt, up the Nile, and to the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nFew persons at the time having visited the Orient, Oglesby's\r\ndescriptions of the wonders of the far-off countries were listened\r\nto with the deepest interest.  With both memory and imagination in\r\ntheir prime, it can easily be believed that those wonders of the\r\nOrient lost nothing by his description.  Soon after his return\r\nhe lectured in Bloomington.  The audience were delighted, especially\r\nwith his description of the Pyramids.\r\n\r\nNone of us had ever before seen or heard a man who had actually,\r\nwith his own eyes, beheld these wonders of the ages.  Near the\r\nclose of his lecture, and just after he had suggested the probability\r\nof Abraham and Sarah having taken in the Pyramids on their wedding\r\ntrip, some one in the audience inquired;\r\n\r\n\"Who built the Pyramids?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, damn it,\" quickly replied the  orator, \"I don't know who built\r\nthem; _I asked everybody I saw in Egypt and none of them knew!\"_\r\n\r\nFor much that is of interest in the career of Governor Oglesby I\r\nam indebted to his honored successor in office, my neighbor and\r\nfriend, Hon. Joseph W. Fifer--than whom the country has had no\r\nbraver soldier and the State no abler Chief Executive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\nTHE ONE ENEMY\r\n\r\nCALEB CUSHING'S POLITICAL CAREER--HIS GREAT AMBITION A SEAT UPON\r\nTHE SUPREME BENCH--HIS APPOINTMENT THERETO--HIS ONE ENEMY DEFEATS HIS\r\nCONFIRMATION.\r\n\r\n_\"He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare,\r\nAnd he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere.\"_\r\n\r\nThe truth of the above couplet has rarely had more forcible\r\nillustration than in the case of the late Caleb Cushing of\r\nMassachusetts.  In politics he was successively Whig, Democrat,\r\nand Republican.  During his first political affiliation, he was\r\na Representative in Congress; in the second a member of Pierce's\r\nCabinet; and in the third a Minister abroad.  He was an eminent\r\nlawyer, and for a term ably discharged the duties of Attorney-General\r\nof the United States.  His one ambition was a seat upon the Supreme\r\nBench.\r\n\r\nThis was at length gratified by his appointment as Chief Justice\r\nof the Great Court.  Unfortunately he had, years before, given\r\nmortal offence to Aaron A. Sargent, then recently admitted to\r\nthe bar.  The latter soon after moved to California, and became in\r\ntime a Senator from that State.\r\n\r\nWhen the appointment of Cushing came before the Senate for\r\nconfirmation, his _one enemy_ was there.  The appointee had long\r\nsince forgotten the young lawyer he had once treated so rudely,\r\nbut he had not been forgotten.  The hour of revenge had now come.\r\nAfter a protracted and bitter struggle, Sargent, of the same\r\npolitical affiliation as Cushing, succeeded in defeating the\r\nconfirmation by a single vote.  The political sensation of the hour\r\nwas the Senator's prompt message to his defeated enemy:\r\n\r\n  \"Time at last sets all things even;\r\n  And if we do but watch the hour,\r\n  There never yet was human power\r\n  Which could evade, if unforgiven,\r\n  The patient search and vigil long,\r\n  Of him who treasures up a wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\nCONTRASTS OF TIMES\r\n\r\nTRAVELLING IN 1845 COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE PRESENT DAY.\r\n\r\nWhile I was Assistant Postmaster-General, Senator Whittihorne,\r\nof Tennessee, called at the Department to see me on official\r\nbusiness.  Seated at a window overlooking the Capitol, he remarked\r\nthat the chords of memory were touched as he entered the room; that\r\nwhen barely of age, he occupied for a time a desk as a clerk just\r\nwhere he was seated.\r\n\r\nHe then told me that at the time of the Presidential election in\r\n1844 he was a law student in the office of Mr. Polk, and by his\r\ninvitation came on with him to Washington.  The journey of the\r\nPresident-elect, from Nashville to Washington, was in February,\r\n1845, just prior to his inauguration.  He was accompanied by the\r\nmembers of his immediate family, his law student Mr. Whittihorne, and\r\nthe Hon. Cave Johnson, who was soon to hold a position in his\r\nCabinet.  The journey to Washington, as Senator Whittihorne told\r\nme, was of two weeks' duration:  first, by steamboat on the Cumberland\r\nand the Ohio to Pittsburg; thence by stage coach to the national\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\nAt the time mentioned, railroads scarcely had an existence south\r\nof the Ohio and west of the Alleghanies; and save the single\r\nwire from Washington to Baltimore, no telegraph line had been\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nHow striking the commentary, alike upon human accomplishment,\r\nand upon opportunity under our free institutions, is here presented!\r\nThe wearisome and hazardous journey of half a month by steamboat\r\nand stage coach had been succeeded by one in palace car of a day\r\nand a night of comparative ease and safety, and the clerk had risen\r\nfrom a humble place in the Department to that of Senator from one of\r\nthe great States in the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\nENDORSING THE ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY EXPERIENCED BY DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS IN PROCURING APPOINTMENTS\r\nFOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS--A NEW MEMBER THREATENS TO FRAME RESOLUTIONS\r\nOF CONDEMNATION--HE DOES THE VERY OPPOSITE--AN EXPLANATORY ANECDOTE.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic members of the forty-ninth Congress who yet survive\r\nwill probably recall something of the difficulty they experienced in\r\nprocuring for aspiring constituents prompt appointments to positions\r\nof honor, trust, and profit, under the then lately inaugurated\r\nadministration.  An earnest desire was felt, and vehemently expressed\r\nat times, by those who had been long excluded from everything that\r\nsavored of Federal recognition, for sweeping changes all along the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nA new member of the House, from one of the border States, believing\r\nthat his grievances were far too heavy to be meekly borne, made\r\nopen declaration of war, and asserted with great confidence and\r\nwith the free use of words nowhere to be found in \"Little Helps to\r\nYouthful Beginners,\" that at the approaching Democratic convention\r\nof his State, resolutions of condemnation of no uncertain sound\r\nwould be adopted.  Some conciliatory observations, which I ventured\r\nto offer, were treated with scorn, and the irate member, still\r\nbreathing out threatenings, hastily turned his footsteps homeward.\r\n\r\nA few mornings later, I was agreeably surprised to find in _The\r\nPost_ a telegram to the effect that upon the assembling of the\r\nconvention aforementioned, the honorable gentleman above designated,\r\nsecuring prompt recognition from the chair, had, under a suspension\r\nof the rules, secured the unanimous adoption of a resolution\r\nenthusiastically and unconditionally endorsing every act, past,\r\npresent, and to come, of the national Democratic administration.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the member to Washington, I expressed to him my\r\nsurprise at a conversion which, in suddenness and power, had possibly\r\nbut one parallel in either sacred or profane history.  Closing his\r\nnear eye, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Look here!  I can illustrate my position about this matter by\r\nrelating a little incident I witnessed near the close of the war.\r\nJust as I was leaving an old ferry-boat in which I had crossed the\r\nTennessee River, my attention was attracted to a canoe near by\r\nin which were seated two fishermen, both negroes, one a very old\r\nman and the other a small boy.  Suddenly the canoe capsized and\r\nthey were both dumped in the deep water.  The boy was an expert\r\nswimmer and was in no danger.  Not so with the old man; he sank\r\nimmediately, and it certainly seemed that his fishing days were\r\nover.  The boy, however, with a pluck and skill that did him great\r\ncredit, instantly dived to the bottom of the river, and with great\r\ndifficulty and much personal peril finally succeeded in landing\r\nthe old man upon the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Approaching the heroic youth, as he was wringing the water from\r\nhis own garments, I inquired,\r\n\r\n\"'Your father, is he?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, sir,' was the quick reply, 'he ain't my father.'\r\n\r\n\"'Your grandfather, then?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, sir, he ain't my grandfather nuther, he ain't no kin to me, I\r\ntell you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Earnestly expressing my surprise at his having imperilled his\r\nown life to save a man who was no kin to him, the boy replied,'\r\n\r\n\"'You see, dis was de way of it boss; _de ole man, he had de bait!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\nANECDOTES ABOUT LINCOLN\r\n\r\nLINCOLN'S TROUBLE WITH THREE EMANCIPATION ENTHUSIASTS--A SCHOOLBOY'S\r\nTROUBLE WITH SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO--PRETTY WELL OFF WITH\r\nA FORTUNE OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS--LINCOLN REBUKES SOME RICH MEN\r\nWHO DEMAND A GUNBOAT FOR THE PROTECTION OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John B. Henderson, now of Washington City, but during the\r\nwar and the early reconstruction period a distinguished Union\r\nSenator from Missouri, relates the following incident of Mr. Lincoln.\r\nDuring the gloomy period of 1862, late one Sunday afternoon he\r\ncalled upon the President and found his alone in his library.\r\nAfter some moments Mr. Lincoln, apparently much depressed, stated\r\nin substance:  \"They are making every effort, Henderson, to induce\r\nme to issue a Proclamation of Emancipation.  Sumner and Wilson and\r\nStevens are constantly urging me, but I don't think it best now;\r\ndo _you_ think so, Henderson?\"  To which the latter promptly replied\r\nthat he did not think so; that such a measure, under existing\r\nconditions, would, in his judgment, be ill-advised and possibly\r\ndisastrous.  \"Just what I think,\" said the President, \"but they\r\nare constantly coming and urging me, sometimes alone, sometimes in\r\ncouples, and sometimes _all three together,_ but constantly pressing\r\nme.\"  With that he walked across the room to a window and looked\r\nout upon the Avenue.  Sure enough, Wilson, Stevens, and Sumner were\r\nseen approaching the Executive Mansion.  Calling his visitor to\r\nthe window and pointing to the approaching figures, in a tone\r\nexpressing something of that wondrous sense of humor that no burden\r\nor disaster could wholly dispel, he said, \"Henderson, did you ever\r\nattend an old field school?\"  Henderson replied that he did.\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" said the President; \"what little education I\r\never got in early life was in that way.  I attended an old field\r\nschool in Indiana, where our only reading-book was the Bible.  One\r\nday we were standing up reading the account of the three Hebrew\r\nchildren in the fiery furnace.  A little tow-headed fellow who\r\nstood beside me had the verse with the unpronounceable names; he\r\nmangled up Shadrach and Meshach woefully, and finally went all\r\nto pieces on Abednego.  Smarting under the blows which, in accordance\r\nwith the old-time custom, promptly followed his delinquency, the\r\nlittle fellow sobbed aloud.  The reading, however, went round, each\r\nboy in the class reading his verse in turn.  The sobbing at length\r\nceased, and the tow-headed boy gazed intently upon the verses ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly he gave a pitiful yell, at which the school-master\r\ndemanded:\r\n\r\n\"'What is the matter with you now?'\r\n\r\n\"'Look there,' said the boy, pointing to the next verse, 'there\r\ncomes them same damn three fellows again!'\"\r\n\r\nAs indicating the slight concern Mr. Lincoln had about money-making,\r\nas well as the significance of the expression \"well-off\" half a\r\ncentury or so ago, the following conversation, related by Judge\r\nWeldon, is in point.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the De Witt Circuit Court in May, 1859, just a\r\nyear before his first nomination for the Presidency, Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas present, unattended for possibly the first time by his life-long\r\nfriend, Major John T. Stuart.  Upon inquiry from Weldon as to\r\nwhether Stuart was coming, Lincoln replied, \"No, Stuart told me\r\nthat he would not be here this term.\"\r\n\r\nWeldon then remarked, \"I suppose the Major has gotten to be pretty\r\nwell off and doesn't have to attend all the courts in the Circuit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Lincoln, \"Stuart is pretty well to do, pretty well to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much is the Major probably worth, Mr. Lincoln?\"  asked Mr.\r\nWeldon.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the latter, after a moment's thought, \"I don't know\r\nexactly; Stuart is pretty well off; _I suppose he must be worth\r\nabout fifteen thousand dollars.\"_\r\n\r\nAnother incident characteristic of Mr. Lincoln, was related by his\r\nfriend Judge Weldon.\r\n\r\nDuring the gloomiest period of the war, and while our seaboard\r\ncities were in constant apprehension of attack, a delegation of\r\nbusiness men from New York visited Washington for the purpose of\r\nhaving a gunboat secured for the defence of their city.  At\r\ntheir request, Judge Weldon accompanied them to the Executive\r\nMansion and introduced them to the President.  The spokesman of\r\nthe delegation, after depicting at length and in somewhat\r\npompous manner, the dangers that threatened the great metropolis, took\r\noccasion, in manner at once conclusive, to state that he spoke with\r\nauthority, that the gentlemen represented property aggregating\r\nin value many hundreds of millions of dollars.  At this, Mr. Lincoln\r\ninterposing impatiently, and in a manner never to be forgotten,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, gentlemen, that if I were as rich as you _say_\r\nyou are, and as badly _scared_ as you _appear_ to be, I would,\r\nin this hour of my country's distress, _just buy that gunboat\r\nmyself!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\nTHE FIRST LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nFAR-REACHING EFFECTS OF THE FOUNDING OF THE VIRGINIA HOUSE OF\r\nBURGESSES--VIRGINIA'S GIFT OF TERRITORY TO THE GOVERNMENT--KASKASKIA\r\nCAPTURED FROM THE BRITISH--JAMESTOWN THE SCENE OF THE FIRST BRITISH\r\nCOLONY--THE BEGINNINGS OF COLONIAL SELF-GOVERNMENT--SALUTARY\r\nLAWS MADE--POCAHONTAS--GOVERNMENT BY CHARTER--DESPOTISM OF JAMES\r\nI--MACAULAY ON THE STUART DYNASTY--THE THIRTEEN ORIGINAL COLONIES--\r\nUNJUST TAXATION--PROGRESS OF REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES--VIRGINIA NOTABLE\r\nFOR HER STATESMEN.\r\n\r\nOn the thirtieth of July, 1907, at the Jamestown Exposition, was\r\ncelebrated the anniversary of the assembling of the House of\r\nBurgesses of Virginia, the first legislative body to assemble upon\r\nthe Western continent.  The meeting was presided over by the present\r\nSpeaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and by invitation of the\r\nPresident of the Exposition addresses were made by ex-speakers\r\nCarlisle, Keifer, and myself.\r\n\r\nMy address was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We have assembled upon historic ground.  We celebrate to-day a\r\nmasterful historic event.  Other anniversaries, sacredly observed,\r\nhave their deep meaning; no one, however, is fraught with profounder\r\nsignificance than this.\r\n\r\n\"The management of the great Exposition did well to set apart this\r\nthirtieth of July to commemorate the coming together at Jamestown of\r\nthe first legislative assembly in the New World.  The assembling\r\nof the representatives of the people upon the eventful day two\r\nhundred and eighty-six years ago--of which this is the anniversary\r\n--marked an epoch which, in far-reaching consequences, scarcely\r\nfinds a parallel in history.  It was the initial step in the series\r\nof stupendous events which found their culmination in the Bill\r\nof Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the formulation of\r\nthe Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"From my home, a thousand miles to the westward, in the great valley\r\nof the Mississippi, I come at your bidding to bear part in the\r\nexercises of this day.  Not as a stranger, an alien to your blood,\r\nbut as your countryman, your fellow-citizen, I gladly lift my voice\r\nin this great assemblage.  And when were the words, 'fellow-citizens,'\r\nof deeper significance as suggestive of a more glorious past\r\nthen to-day, as we gather upon this hallowed spot to commemorate\r\none of the grandest events of which history has any record?\r\n\r\n\"The magical words, 'fellow-citizens,' never fail to touch a\r\nresponsive chord in the patriotic heart.  Was it the gifted Prentiss\r\nwho at a critical moment of our history exclaimed, 'For whether\r\nupon the Sabine or the St. Johns; standing in the shadow of Bunker\r\nHill, or amid the ruins of Jamestown; near the great northern chain\r\nof lakes, or within the sound of the Father of Waters, flowing\r\nunvexed to the sea; in the crowded mart of the great metropolis,\r\nor upon the western verge of the continent, where the restless tide\r\nof emigration is stayed only by the ocean--everywhere upon this\r\nbroad domain, thank God, I can still say, \"fellow-citizens\"'?\r\n\r\n\"And truly, an Illinoisan is no stranger within the confines of\r\n'the Old Dominion.' You have not forgotten, we cannot forget, that\r\nthe territory now embraced in five magnificent commonwealths\r\nbordering upon the Ohio and the Mississippi, was at a crucial period\r\nof our history the generous gift of Virginia to the general\r\nGovernment,--a gift that in splendid statesmanship and in far-reaching\r\nconsequence has no counterpart; one which at the pivotal moment made\r\npossible the ratification of the Articles of Confederation--the\r\nsure forecast of 'the more perfect Union' yet to follow.  Illinois,\r\nthe greatest of the commonwealths to which I have alluded, can\r\nnever forget that it was a Virginian, George Rogers Clark, who, in\r\nthe darkest days of the Revolution, led the expedition--'worthy of\r\nmention,' as was said by John Randolph, 'with that of Hannibal\r\nin Italy,'--by which the ancient capital, Kaskaskia, was captured,\r\nthe British flag deposed, and Illinois taken possession of in\r\nthe name of the commonwealth whose Governor, Patrick Henry, had\r\nauthorized the masterful conquest.  Nor can it be forgotten that\r\nthe deed of cession by which Illinois became part and parcel of\r\nthe general Government, bears--as commissioners upon the part of\r\nVirginia--the honored names of Arthur Lee, James Monroe, and Thomas\r\nJefferson.  Is it to be wondered at, that a magnificent Illinois\r\nbuilding adorns the grounds of the Jamestown Exposition,--and that\r\nIllinois hearts everywhere beat in unison with yours in the\r\ncelebration of one of the epoch-marking days of all the ages?\r\n\r\n\"The time is propitious for setting history aright.  This exposition\r\nwill not have been in vain if the fact be crystallized into history\r\nyet to be written, that the first settlement by English-speaking\r\npeople--just three centuries ago--upon this continent, was at\r\nJamestown.  And that here self-government--in its crude form but\r\nnone the less self-government--had its historical beginning.  Truly\r\nhas it been said by an eminent writer of your own State, that prior\r\nto December, 1620, 'the colony of Virginia had become so firmly\r\nestablished and self-government in precisely the same form which\r\nexisted up to the Revolution throughout the English colonies had\r\ntaken such firm root thereon, that it was beginning to affect\r\nnot only the people but the Government of Great Britain.'  In\r\nthe old church at Jamestown, on July 30, 1619, was held the\r\nfirst legislative assembly of the New World--the historical House of\r\nBurgesses.  It consisted of twenty-two members, and its constituencies\r\nwere the several plantations of the colony.  A speaker was elected,\r\nthe session opened with prayer, and the oath of supremacy duly\r\ntaken.  The Governor and Council occupied the front seats, and the\r\nmembers of the body, in accordance with the custom of the\r\nBritish Parliament, wore their hats during the session.\r\n\r\n\"This General Assembly convened in response to a summons issued by\r\nSir George Yeardley, the recently appointed Governor of the colony.\r\nHitherto the colony had been governed by the London Council; the\r\nreal life of Virginia dates from the arrival of Yeardley, bringing\r\nwith him from England 'commissions and instructions for the better\r\nestablishing of a commonwealth.'\r\n\r\n\"The centuries roll back, and before us, in solemn session, is the\r\nfirst assembly upon this continent of the chosen representatives\r\nof the people.  It were impossible to overstate its deep import to\r\nthe struggling colony, or its far-reaching consequence to States\r\nyet unborn.  In this little assemblage of twenty-two burgesses,\r\nthe Legislatures of nearly fifty commonwealths to-day and of the\r\nCongress with its representatives from all the States of 'an\r\nindestructible union' find their historical beginning.  The words of\r\nBancroft in this connection are worthy of remembrance:  'A perpetual\r\ninterest attaches to this first elective body that ever assembled\r\nin the Western world, representing the people of Virginia and making\r\nlaws for their government more than a year before the _Mayflower_ with\r\nthe Pilgrims left the harbor of Southampton, and while Virginia\r\nwas still the only British colony on the continent of America.'\r\n\r\n\"It is to us to-day a matter of profound gratitude that these\r\nthe earliest American lawgivers were eminently worthy their high\r\nvocation.  While confounding, in some degree, the separate functions\r\nof government, as abstractly defined at a later day by Montesquieu,\r\nand eventually put in concrete form in our fundamental laws, State\r\nand Federal--it is none the less true that these first legislators\r\nclearly discerned their inherent rights as a part of the English-speaking\r\nrace.  More important still, a perusal of the brief records they\r\nhave left, impresses the conviction that they were no strangers to\r\nthe underlying fact that the people are the true source of political\r\npower, the evidence whereof is to be found in the scant records of\r\ntheir proceedings--a priceless heritage of all future generations.\r\nAnd first--and fundamental in all legislative assemblies--they\r\nasserted the absolute right to determine as to the election and\r\nqualification of members.  Grants of land were asked, not only for\r\nthe planters, but for their wives, 'as equally important parts\r\nof the colony.'  It was wisely provided that of the natives 'the\r\nmost towardly boys in wit and the graces' should be educated and set\r\napart to the work of converting the Indians to the Christian\r\nreligion; stringent penalties were attached to idleness, gambling,\r\nand drunkenness; excess in apparel was prohibited by heavy taxation;\r\nencouragement was given to agriculture in all its known forms;\r\nwhile conceding 'the commission of privileges' brought over by the\r\nnew Governor as their fundamental law, yet with the liberty-guarding\r\ninstinct of their race they kept the way open for seeking redress,\r\n'in case they should find aught not perfectly squaring with the\r\nstate of the colony.'  No less important were the enactments\r\nregulating the dealings of the colonists with the Indians.  Yet to\r\nbe mentioned, and of transcendent importance, was the claim of the\r\nburgesses 'to allow or disallow,' at their own good pleasure,\r\nall orders of the court of the London Company.  And deeply significant\r\nwas the declaration of these representatives of three centuries\r\nago, that their enactments were instantly to be put in force,\r\nwithout waiting for their ratification in England.  And not to\r\nbe forgotten is the stupendous fact that while the battle with the\r\nuntamed forces of nature was yet waging, and conflict with savage foe\r\nof constant recurrence, these legislators provided for the maintenance\r\nof public worship, and took the initial steps for the establishment\r\nof an institution of learning.  It is not too much to say that the\r\nhour that witnessed these enactments witnessed the triumph of\r\nthe popular over the court party; in no unimportant sense, the\r\nfirst triumph of the American colonists over kingly prerogative.\r\nLooking through the mists of the mighty past, Mr. Speaker, to\r\nthe House of Burgesses, over which your first predecessor presided,\r\nwould it be out of place to apply to that assemblage the\r\nhistoric words spoken of one of a later period:  'Nobles by the\r\nright of an earlier creation, and priests by the imposition of a\r\nmightier hand'?\r\n\r\n\"Did the occasion permit, it would be of wondrous interest to linger\r\nfor a time with these, the earliest colonies in this, the cradle\r\nof American civilization; to know something of their daily life,\r\ntheir hopes and ambitions, their struggles and triumphs; something\r\nof their ceaseless vigil and of the perils that environed them; to\r\nrecall stirring incidents and heroic achievements; to catch a gleam\r\nof a spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion which in all the annals\r\nof men scarcely finds a parallel.  It would be of curious interest\r\nto watch the parade and pomp of governors and councils of royal\r\nappointment in attempted representation of a pageantry familiar to\r\nthe Old World, but which was to have no permanent abiding place in\r\nthe New.  Governors and their subordinates--though bearing the\r\nroyal commission, yet in rare instances to be classed only as bad or\r\nindifferent--pass in long procession before us into the dim shadows.\r\nBut out of the mists of this long past, two figures emerge that\r\nhave for us an abiding interest, John Smith and Pocahontas--names\r\nthat have place not alone in romance and song, but upon the pages of\r\nveritable history.\r\n\r\n\"Colonial governors strutted their brief hour upon the stage and\r\nhave long passed to oblivion; but Smith, the intrepid soldier, the\r\never-present friend and counsellor of the early colonists, their\r\nstalwart protector--alike against the bullet of the savage and the\r\nmandate of official power--will not pass from remembrance so long as\r\nheroic deeds are counted worthy of enduring record among men.\r\n\r\n\"With dark background of rude cabin and wigwam, of scantily appointed\r\nplantation, and of far-stretching forest--with its mysterious voices\r\nand manifold perils--there passes before us the lovely form of the\r\nbeautiful Indian maiden, the daughter and pride of the renowned\r\nnative chieftain.  So long as courage and fidelity arouse sympathy\r\nand admiration, so long will the thrilling legend of Pocahontas\r\ntouch responsive chords in human hearts.  Its glamour is upon\r\nthe early pages of colonial history; her witchery lingers upon\r\nstream and forest, and the firm earth upon which we tread seems to\r\nhave been hallowed by her footsteps.\r\n\r\n\"A name that sheds lustre upon the earliest pages of our Colonial history\r\nis that of Sir Edwin Sandys.  Under his courageous leadership, what\r\nwas known as the Virginia or Liberal party in the London Company\r\nobtained a signal triumph over that of the court.  The result\r\nwas the formal grant to the colony guaranteeing free government by\r\nwritten charter.  Its declared purpose was to secure 'the greatest\r\ncomfort and benefit to the people and the prevention of injustice,\r\ngrievances, and oppression.'  It provided for full legislative\r\nauthority in the Assembly, and was with some modifications the\r\nmodel of the systems subsequently introduced into the other English\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n\"By this charter, representative government and trial by jury became\r\nrecognized rights in the New World.  Upon this charter, as has been\r\ntruly said, 'Virginia erected the superstructure of her liberties.'\r\n\r\n\"The coming of this charter marked an epoch in the history of\r\nthe Jamestown colony, and set the pace for English-speaking\r\nsettlements yet in the future.\r\n\r\n\"It was in very truth the first step in the direction of the\r\nestablishment of the great Republic which was to be the enduring\r\nbeacon-light of self-governing people in all future ages.\r\n\r\n\"To a full appreciation of the supreme significance of the mighty event\r\nwe to-day celebrate and its results--now constituting so inspiring\r\na chapter of history--some account must be taken of conditions then\r\nexisting in the mother country.  While obtaining the guarantee of a\r\nlarge measure of self-government for the New World, Sir Edwin Sandys\r\nand his co-patriots were unable to secure that which even savored of\r\nliberal administration in the Old.  James--the first of the Stuart\r\nDynasty--was upon the English throne.  In narrow, selfish state-craft\r\nhis is possibly in the long list of sovereigns without a rival.\r\nThe exercise and maintenance of royal prerogative was with him the\r\n'be all and end all' of government, and, abetted by the sycophants\r\nabout him, he unwittingly laid the train of inexorable events that\r\nwere to culminate in the execution of one and the banishment of\r\nanother of his line.  His claim was that of absolute power, and\r\nduring a reign of twenty-two years--extending from the death of\r\nQueen Elizabeth to the year 1625--he was the unrelenting foe of\r\nwhatever pertained to freedom in religion or in government.  His\r\napparent indifference to the execution of his mother--the ill-fated\r\nMary, Queen of Scots--and his condemnation of the illustrious\r\nSir Walter Raleigh to the scaffold, are alone sufficient to render\r\nthe memory of this monarch forever infamous.  It is a marvel,\r\nindeed, that with James the First upon the throne, and popular\r\nfreedom in such a low state throughout his immediate realm, that\r\nso large a measure of liberty should have been conceded to the\r\ndistant colony.  The achievement is the enduring evidence of\r\nunsurpassed courage in the men in whose immediate keeping were the\r\nearly fortunes of the Virginia colony, and sheds unfading lustre\r\nupon their memories.\r\n\r\n\"Nor can it be forgotten that from the masterful hour that witnessed\r\nthe assembling of the first House of Burgesses until the abdication\r\nof James the Second, the welfare of the Virginia colony was in\r\nlarge measure in the iron grasp of stern antagonists to all that\r\npertained to liberty of conscience and to popular rule.  Whatever there\r\nwas of progress during the seventy years--barring the brief period\r\nof the Commonwealth--that immediately preceded the historic English\r\nRevolution, and the crowning of William and Mary, was despite\r\nthe untiring hostility of the Stuart Dynasty.  During this period the\r\nlives of Englishmen at home were as the dust in the balance.  It\r\nwitnessed the very heyday of the infamous Star Chamber.  It was of\r\nStrafford, the bloody instrument (though wearing judicial ermine) of\r\nCharles the First, that Macaulay said:  'If justice, in the whole\r\nrange of its wide armory, contained one weapon which could pierce him,\r\nthat weapon his pursuers were bound, before God and man, to employ.'\r\n\r\n\"And for all time, the Stuart Dynasty itself remains impaled by\r\nthe pen of the same master:\r\n\r\n\"'Then came those days never to be recalled without a blush--the\r\ndays of servitude without loyalty, and sensuality without love, of\r\ndwarfish talents and gigantic vices, the paradise of cold hearts\r\nand narrow minds, the golden age of the coward, the bigot, and the\r\nslave.  The principles of liberty were the scoff of every grinning\r\ncourtier, and the _anathema maranatha_ of every fawning dean.\r\nIn every high place worship was paid to Charles and James--Belial and\r\nMoloch,--and England propitiated those obscene and cruel idols with\r\nthe blood of her best and bravest children.  Crime succeeded to\r\ncrime and disgrace to disgrace, until the race, accursed of God\r\nand man, was a second time driven forth to wander on the face of\r\nthe earth, and to be a byword and a shaking of the head to the\r\nnations.'\r\n\r\n\"It is our pleasing task to turn now from the dark annals of our\r\nEnglish forebears to the stupendous events of which that we to-day\r\ncelebrate in the historical forecast.  With the passing years, a\r\ncontinuing tide of emigration was setting in from the Old to the\r\nNew World.  Additional settlements had sprung into being, and\r\nthe Plantation in its distinctive sense had given way to the Colony,\r\nto be succeeded yet later by the State.  The glory of Jamestown\r\nhad measurably departed, and to Williamsburg, and yet later to the\r\nnow splendid city upon the James, had been transferred the seat of\r\nVirginia authority.  New England, despite natural obstacles and\r\nconstant peril, was surely working out her large place in history.\r\nPuritan, Quaker, Dutchman, Cavalier, Scotch-Irish, and Huguenot\r\n--'building better than they knew'--had established permanent\r\nhabitations from Plymouth Rock to Savannah.  Brave men from the\r\nearly fringe of settlements upon the Atlantic--regardless of\r\nobstacle and danger--had pushed their way westward, and laid the\r\nsure foundations of future commonwealths.  From New Hampshire to\r\nGeorgia, thirteen English-speaking colonies, with a population\r\naggregating near two millions, had attained to a large measure\r\nof the dignity of distinctive States.  Their allegiance, meanwhile,\r\nto the mother country had been unfaltering, and in her fierce\r\nstruggle with France for the mastery of the continent, America had\r\nsealed her loyalty with the best blood of her sons.\r\n\r\n\"The successors to the first House of Burgesses had learned well\r\nthe lessons gleaned from the scant pages of their earliest history.\r\nAttempts to tax the unrepresented colonies soon encountered concerted\r\nhostility.  'No taxation without representation' became the universal\r\nslogan.  The words spoken in the British Parliament by Barre--worthy\r\ncomrade of the gallant Wolfe on the Heights of Abraham--near a\r\ncentury and a half after the event we now celebrate, will quicken the\r\npulse of all coming generations of American patriots.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"'Your oppressions planted them in America.  They fled from your\r\ntyranny to a then uncultivated, unhospitable country where they\r\nexposed themselves to almost all the hardships to which human nature\r\nis liable, among others to the cruelties of a savage foe; they grew\r\nby your neglect of them.  As soon as you began to care for them,\r\nthat care was exercised in sending persons to rule them, to spy\r\nout their liberties, to misrepresent their actions and to prey upon\r\nthem; men whose behavior on many occasions has caused the blood of\r\nthose sons of liberty to recoil within them; men promoted to the\r\nhighest seats of justice, some who, to my knowledge, were glad, by\r\ngoing to a foreign country, to escape being brought to the bar of a\r\ncourt of justice in their own.  The colonists have nobly taken\r\nup arms in your defence; have asserted a valor amid their constant\r\nand laborious industry for the defence of a country whose frontier\r\nwas drenched in blood.  And, believe me--remember, I warn you--the\r\nsame spirit of freedom which actuated that people at first will\r\naccompany them still.'\r\n\r\n\"And how prophetic now seem the words of Burke in the same great\r\ndebate:\r\n\r\n\"'There is America, which at this day serves for little more than to\r\namuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners, yet shall,\r\nbefore you taste of death, show itself equal to the whole of\r\nthat commerce which now attracts the envy of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"Standing at his hour almost within hailing distance of the spot\r\nthat witnessed the surrender of Cornwallis and the termination\r\nof the War of the Revolution, it would be passing strange if we\r\nshould fail to catch something of the inspiration of the impassioned\r\nwords of Barre and of Burke, and their wondrous associations.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that in Venice there is sacredly preserved a letter\r\nwritten by Columbus a few hours before he sailed from Palos.  With\r\nreverent expression of trust in God--humbly but with unfaltering\r\nfaith--he spoke of his past voyage to 'that famous land.'  His\r\ndream while a suppliant in the outer chambers of kings, and\r\nwhile keeping lonely vigil upon the deep, was the discovery of a\r\nnew pathway to the Indies.  Yet who can doubt that to his prophetic\r\nsoul was even then fore-shadowed something of 'that famous land'\r\nwith the warp and woof of whose history, tradition, and song his\r\nname and fame are linked for all time.  Can it not truly be said\r\nof the members of the first House of Burgesses, as was said of\r\nColumbus and his compeers, 'They were pioneers in the march to\r\nindependence--precursors in the only progress of freedom which was\r\nto have no backward steps?'  They only 'opened the gates' and\r\nlo! there came in the builders of a new and mighty nation.\r\n\r\n\"Had it been given to the Virginia--the American--legislators whose\r\nmemories we honor this day, 'to look into the seeds of time,' what\r\nmighty events, with the rolling years and centuries, would have\r\npassed before their visions.  They would have seen the colony they\r\nhad planted in the wilderness, day by day strengthening its cords,\r\nenlarging its borders, and with firm tread advancing steadily to\r\nrecognized place among the nations.  They would have beheld the\r\nsavage foe--giving way before the inexorable advance of the hated\r\n'pale face'--sadly retreating toward the ever-receding western\r\nverge of civilization.  It would have been theirs to witness the\r\nsymbols of French and Spanish authority disappear forever from\r\nmainland and island of the New World.  Following the sun a thousand\r\nmiles toward his setting, their eyes would have been gladdened\r\nby the great river flowing unvexed from northern lake to southern sea\r\nthrough a mighty realm that knew no allegiance other than to the\r\ngovernment that here had its feeble beginning.  They would--near a\r\ncentury and a half later than the meeting of the first House of\r\nBurgesses--have beheld their descendants listening in rapt attention\r\nto the impassioned denunciation by Patrick Henry of the tyranny of\r\nthe royal successor of James the First; the thirteen colonies arming\r\nfor the seven years' struggle with the most powerful of nations;\r\nthe presentation, by a Virginian, in the wondrous assemblage at\r\nPhiladelphia of the Declaration of Independence; under the matchless\r\nleadership of a Virginian yet more illustrious than Jefferson, the\r\nColonial army, with decimated ranks and tattered standards,\r\nwould have passed in review--all past suffering, sacrifice,\r\nhumiliation, and defeat forgotten in the hour of splendid triumph.\r\nYet later, and in the great convention over which Washington\r\npresided, and in which Madison was the chief factor, they would\r\nhave witnessed the deathless principles of the historic Declaration\r\ncrystallized into the Federal compact, which was destined forever to\r\nhold States and people in fraternal union.  They would have seen\r\na gallant people of the Old World--catching inspiration from the\r\nNew--casting off the oppression of centuries and, through baptism of\r\nblood, fashioning a Republic upon that whose liberties they had so\r\nsignally aided to establish.  Yet later, and not France alone, but\r\nMexico and States extending far to the southward, substituting for\r\nmonarchical rule that of the people under written Constitutions\r\nmodeled after that of the great American Republic.  And yet more\r\nmarvellous, in Great Britain the divine right of kings an exploded\r\ndogma; the royal successor to the Stuarts and George the Third only\r\na ceremonial figurehead in government; the House of Lords in its\r\ndeath struggle; all real political power centred in the Commons,\r\nand England--though still under the guise of monarchy--essentially\r\na republic.\r\n\r\n\"And what a grand factor Virginia has been in all that pertains to\r\nhuman government in this Western world during the past three\r\ncenturies.  From the pen of one of her illustrious sons, George\r\nMason, came the 'Bill of Rights'--now in its essentials embedded\r\nby the early amendments into our Federal Constitution; from that\r\nof another, not alone the great Declaration, but the statutes\r\nsecuring for his own State religious freedom, and the abolition of\r\nprimogeniture--the detested legacy of British ancestors.  His sword\r\nreturned to its scabbard with the achievement of the independence of\r\nthe colonies, and the mission of Washington was yet but half\r\naccomplished.  To garner up the fruits of successful revolution by\r\nensuring stable government was the task demanding the loftiest\r\nstatesmanship.  The five years immediately succeeding our first\r\ntreaty of peace with Great Britain have been truly defined, 'our\r\nperiod of greatest peril.'  It was fortunate, indeed, that Washington\r\nwas called to preside over the historic convention of '87, and that\r\nhis spirit--a yearning for an indissoluble union of the States--\r\npermeated all its deliberations.  Fortunate, indeed, that in its\r\ncouncils was his colleague and friend, the constructive statesman,\r\nJames Madison.  Inseparably associated for all time with the\r\nformulation and interpretation of the great covenant are the names\r\nof two illustrious Virginians--for all the ages illustrious Americans\r\n--Madison, the father, and Marshall, the expounder of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"It remained to another son of this first commonwealth, from the\r\nhigh place to which he had been chosen, to enunciate in trenchant words,\r\nat a crucial moment, a national policy which, under the designation\r\nof 'the Monroe doctrine,' has been the common faith of three\r\ngenerations of his countrymen and is to remain the enduring bar to\r\nthe establishment of monarchial government upon this western\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\n\"Four decades later, at the striking of the hour that noted the\r\ninevitable 'breaking with the past,' it remained to still\r\nanother illustrious successor of Jefferson--alike of Virginian\r\nancestry, and born within her original domain--by authoritative\r\nproclamation to liberate a race, and thereby, for all time, to give\r\nenlarged and grander meaning to our imperishable declaration of\r\nhuman rights.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen, the little settlement planted just three centuries\r\nago near the spot upon which we have to-day assembled has under\r\ndivine guidance grown into a mighty nation.  Eighty millions of\r\npeople, proud of local traditions and achievements, yet looking\r\nbeyond the mere confines of their distinctive commonwealths,\r\nfind their chief glory in being citizens of the great Republic.\r\nThe mantle of peace is over our own land, and our accredited\r\nrepresentatives in the world's conference, at this auspicious hour,\r\nare outlining a policy that looks to the establishment of enduring\r\npeace among all the nations.  To-day, inspired by the sublime\r\nlessons of the event we celebrate and with hearts of gratitude\r\nto God for all he hath vouchsafed to our fathers and to us in\r\nthe past, let us take courage, and turn our faces hopefully,\r\nreverently, trustingly to the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\nA NEW DAY ADDED TO THE CALENDAR\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH CHARACTER OF STERLING MORTON AS A MAN AND A PUBLIC SERVANT\r\n--HONORED BY CLEVELAND--ORIGINATOR OF ARBOR DAY.\r\n\r\nI recall with pleasure years of close personal friendship with\r\nJ. Sterling Morton.  He was a gentleman of lofty character and\r\nrecognized ability.  Much of his life was given to the public\r\nservice.  As Secretary of Agriculture he was in close touch with\r\nPresident Cleveland during his last official term.\r\n\r\nAt the dedication of the monument erected to his memory at his\r\nhome, Nebraska City, October 28, 1905, I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I count it high privilege to speak a few words upon an occasion\r\nso fraught with interest to this State, and to the entire country.\r\nI gladly bear my humble tribute to the man whom I honored in life,\r\nand whose memory I cherish.  A manlier man than Sterling Morton,\r\none more thoughtful, kind, considerate, self-reliant, hopeful, I\r\nhave not known.  Truly--\r\n\r\n  'A man he seemed, of cheerful yesterdays,\r\n  And confident to-morrows.'\r\n\r\nOf few men could it more truly be said, 'He took counsel ever of\r\nhis courage--never of his fears.'  With firm convictions upon\r\npending vital issues, he did not shrink from the conflict.  His\r\nantagonist he met in the open.  In the words of Lord Brougham, 'His\r\nweapons were ever those of the warrior--never of the assassin.'\r\n\r\n\"This, is indeed no ordinary occasion.  Here and now, we unveil\r\na monument erected in honor of the memory of one who, alike in\r\nprivate life and in public station, illustrated the noblest\r\ncharacteristics of the American citizen.  Something of his life\r\nand achievements we have heard with profound interest from the lips\r\nof the chosen orator of this great occasion, ex-President Cleveland\r\n--one indeed eminently fitted for the task.  The orator was worthy\r\nthe subject; the subject--honoring the memory of one of the\r\nbenefactors of his age--worthy the orator.\r\n\r\n\"In all the relations of life, the man whose memory we honor this day\r\nwas worthy the emulation of the young men who succeed him upon the\r\nstage of the world.  With clear brain and clean hands he ably\r\nand faithfully administered high public trusts.  He was in the\r\nloftiest sense worthy the personal and official association of the\r\neminent Chief Magistrate at whose Council Board he sat, and\r\nwhose confidence he fully shared.\r\n\r\n\"Fortune, indeed, came with both hands full to Nebraska, when J.\r\nSterling Morton, in early manhood, selected this struggling frontier\r\nState for his home.  How well, and with what large interest, he\r\nrepaid Nebraska for a confidence that knew no abatement, this noble\r\nmonument is the enduring witness.\r\n\r\n\"Under his guiding hand, a new day was added to the calendar.  The\r\nglory is his of having called Arbor Day into being.  Touched by\r\nhis magic wand, millions of trees now beautify and adorn this\r\nmagnificent State.  It is no mere figure of speech to say that the\r\nwilderness--by transition almost miraculous--has become a garden, the\r\ndesolate places been made to blossom as the rose.  'Tree-planting\r\nday' is now one of the sacred days of this commonwealth.  Henceforth,\r\nupon its annual recurrence, ordinary avocations are to be suspended,\r\nand this day wholly set apart to pursuits which tend to beautify\r\nthe home, make glorious the landscape, and gladden the hearts of\r\nall the people.  Inseparably associated in all the coming years\r\nwith this day and its memories will be the name of J. Sterling\r\nMorton.  That he was its inspiration, is his abiding fame.\r\n\r\n\"In other times, monuments have been erected to men whose chief\r\ndistinction was, that desolation and human slaughter had marked\r\ntheir pathways.  The hour has struck, and a new era dawned.  The\r\nmonument we now unveil is to one whose name brings no thoughts\r\nof decimated ranks, or of desolated provinces, no memories of\r\nbeleaguered cities, of starving peoples, or of orphans' tears.  In\r\nall the years, it will be associated with glorious peace.  Peace, 'that\r\nhath her victories no less renowned than war'; peace, in whose\r\ntrain are happy homes, songs of rejoicing, the glad laughter of\r\nchildren, the planting of trees, and the golden harvest.\r\n\r\n  'Soft peace she brings; wherever she arrives,\r\n  She builds our quiet as she forms our lives;\r\n  Lays the rough paths of peevish nature even,\r\n  And opens in each heart a little heaven.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\nA MOUNTAIN COLLEGE\r\n\r\nSUCH INSTITUTIONS VALUABLE FOR MOULDING CHARACTER--MR. SCOTT\r\nBOTH HONORABLE AND PRUDENT IN BUSINESS--HIS GREATNESS AS AN\r\nAGRICULTURIST--HIS AVOIDANCE OF PUBLIC LIFE--HIS SOCIAL AND DOMESTIC\r\nVIRTUES--DEPENDENCE OF THE NATION ON THE CHARACTER OF ITS LITERARY\r\nINSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, Mrs. Julia Green Scott, of Bloomington, Illinois, established\r\na college in the mountains of Kentucky in honor of the memory of\r\nher husband.  He was a native of Kentucky, and the institution\r\nbears his honored name.\r\n\r\nUpon the occasion of the dedication I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The dedication of the Matthew T. Scott, Jr., Collegiate Institute\r\nmarks an important epoch in the history of central eastern Kentucky.\r\nIt cannot be doubted that this institution will be potent for good\r\nin moulding the character and fitting the youth of this and succeeding\r\ngenerations for the important duties that pertain to citizenship\r\nin a great Republic.  Is it too much to believe that this may be\r\nreckoned as one of the many agencies in this land, that in the\r\noutstretched years will inspire our youth with yet higher ideals of\r\nduties that await them in life?  Would that the words I now repeat\r\nof one of England's great statesmen could be indelibly impressed\r\nupon the memory of all who may hereafter pass out from these walls:\r\n'Be inspired with the belief that life is a great and noble calling;\r\nnot a mean and grovelling thing that we are to shuffle through\r\nas we can, but an elevated and lofty destiny.'\r\n\r\n\"It is eminently fitting to this occasion, that I recall something\r\nof the man whose honored name has been appropriately given to this\r\ninstitution.  And yet, I am not unmindful of the fact that if in\r\nlife he would shrink from public mention of his name, or of\r\naught associated with it in the way of benefactions.  He was a\r\nnative of Kentucky--born in Fayette County, February 4, 1828.  His\r\nfather, of the same name, was an honored citizen of Lexington, and\r\nfor many years the leading banker of the State.  The son inherited\r\nthe high sense of personal honor, and the splendid capacity for\r\nbusiness, that for a lifetime so eminently characterized his father.\r\nA graduate of Centre College at the age of eighteen, his fortunes\r\nwere soon cast in Central Illinois, where his remaining years were\r\nspent, and where his ashes now repose.  During his early residence\r\nin Illinois Mr. Scott realized--as few men did fully at that day\r\n--the marvellous prosperity that surely awaited the development of\r\nthe resources of that great State.  It was the day of golden\r\nopportunity for the man of wise forecast.  His investments were\r\ntimely; his business methods all upon the highest plane.  He became\r\nin time a large landed proprietor, and stood in the van of the\r\nadvanced agriculturists of his day.  He formulated enduring systems\r\nof tilling the soil, and making sure the munificent reward of labor\r\nwisely bestowed upon this, the primal calling of man.  His methods\r\nwere in large measure adopted by others, and have proved no\r\nunimportant factor in the development and prosperity of the\r\ngreat agricultural interests of the State.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Scott was in the largest sense a man of affairs.  He was ever\r\nthe safe counsellor in the many business enterprises of which he\r\nwas the founder.  It were scant praise to say he was possessed\r\nof the highest integrity.  His was indeed an integrity that could know\r\nno temptation.  Faithful to every obligation, he was incapable\r\nof an ignoble act.  He was eminently a just man, possessing in a\r\nmarked degree the sturdy characteristics of his Scotch-Irish\r\nancestors.  His principle in action was:\r\n\r\n  'For justice all place a temple,\r\n  And all season Summer.'\r\n\r\n\"He was in no sense a self-seeker.  Deeply interested in public\r\naffairs, and having the courage of his convictions upon the exciting\r\nquestions of the day, he was never a candidate for public office.\r\nDeclining the nomination tendered him by his party for Congress,\r\nhe chose the quiet of home rather than the turmoil of public life.\r\nIn the advocacy, however, of what he believed to be for the public weal,\r\n'he took counsel ever of his courage, never of his fears.'  That he\r\npossessed the ability to have acquitted himself with honor in\r\nresponsible positions of public trust, no one who knew him could doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Courteous to all with whom he came in contact, he was the highest\r\ntype of the old-school gentleman.  He exemplified in his daily life\r\nthe truth of the poet's words:\r\n\r\n  'That best portion of a good man's life,\r\n  His little, nameless, unremembered acts\r\n  Of kindness and of love.'\r\n\r\n\"No man ever had a loftier appreciation of what was due to woman.\r\nThere was in very truth a relish of old-time chivalry in his bearing\r\nin the presence of ladies.  He was never happier than when surrounded\r\nby children, by whom he was ever trusted and loved.\r\n\r\n\"No higher tribute could be paid him than by the words spoken with\r\nequal truth of another:  'With him the assured guardian of my\r\nchildren, I could have pillowed my head in peace.'\r\n\r\n\"Holding steadily, and without reservation, to the Presbyterian\r\nfaith of his fathers, he was none the less imbued with a true\r\ncatholic spirit, and gave where needed, liberally of his abundance.\r\nHe was deeply touched by every tale of human sorrow,\r\n\r\n  'His hand open as day to melting charity.'\r\n\r\n\"I may be pardoned for adding that Mr. Scott was supremely happy\r\nin his domestic ties.  Blessed in all who gathered about his\r\nhearthstone, his cup of happiness was full to overflowing.  All\r\nwho crossed his threshold felt that they were indeed in the sunshine\r\nof the perfect home.  He sleeps in the beautiful cemetery near the\r\ncity he loved, his grave covered with flowers by those to whom\r\nin life he had been a benefactor and friend.  To those to whom his\r\ntoils and cares were given, to kindred and friends, his memory will\r\never be a precious heritage.  Truly,\r\n\r\n  'the just\r\n  Keeps something of his glory, in his dust.'\r\n\r\n\"I know of no words more fitting with which to close this poor\r\ntribute to the man I honored and loved, than those of Dr. Craig in\r\nhis beautiful eulogy upon the Rev. Dr. Lewis W. Green, father of\r\nMrs. Julia G. Scott, the noble and gifted woman whose generosity\r\nhas made possible the founding of the Institution we now dedicate:\r\n\r\n\"'Society at large felt the impress of his noble character, his\r\npolished breeding, and his widespread beneficence.  His determination\r\nto excel, and that by means of faithful diligence and laborious\r\napplications, should arouse our young men to like fidelity to their\r\nincreasing opportunities.  He was the most unselfish of men, the\r\nmost affectionate of friends, the humblest of Christians.  He owed\r\nmuch to the soil from which he sprang.  He repaid that much, and\r\nwith large interest.'\r\n\r\n\"The Institution we now dedicate is just upon the threshold of what\r\nwe trust will prove an abundantly useful and honorable career.\r\nAnd while we may not 'look into the seeds of time and say which\r\ngrain will grow and which will not,' yet we may well believe\r\nthat under judicious management, already assured, this will prove a\r\npotent agency in the great work of education.\r\n\r\n\"In this connection the words of a former President of Transylvania\r\nUniversity, and of Centre College, Dr. Green, possess to-day as\r\ndeep significance as when uttered almost a half-century ago:\r\n\r\n\"'But it may be truly said, that no domestic instruction, however wise,\r\nno political institution, however free, no social organization,\r\nhowever perfect, no discoveries of science, however rapid or sublime,\r\nno activity of the press--pouring forth with prolific abundance\r\nits multitudinous publications--no accumulation of ancient learning\r\nin stately libraries, no one, nor all of these together, can\r\nsupersede the education of the school; nay, all of them derive\r\ntheir noblest elements and highest life from the instruction of\r\nthe living teacher.  The intelligence of families, the wisdom of\r\nGovernments, the freedom of nations, the progress of science itself,\r\nand of all our useful arts, is measured by the condition and\r\ncharacter of our literary institutions. . . . It is from such as\r\nthese, that the world's great men have sprung.  It is from the\r\ndeep, granite foundations of society that the materials are gathered\r\nto rear a superstructure of massive grandeur and enduring strength.\r\nThe God of nature has scattered broadcast over all our land and\r\nour mountain heights, in our secluded valleys, and in many a forest\r\nhome, the choicest elements of genius; invaluable means of intellectual\r\nwealth, the noblest treasures of the State.'\r\n\r\n\"The hour has struck, and the Matthew T. Scott, Jr., Collegiate\r\nInstitution enters now upon its sacred mission.\r\n\r\n\"May we not believe that here will be realized in full fruition\r\nthe fond hopes of those who have given it being? that as the years\r\ncome and go, there will pass out from its walls those who by diligent\r\napplication are fitted for the responsible duties that await them in\r\nlife, well equipped, it may be, to acquit themselves with honor,\r\nin the high places of school, of church, or of State?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\nDEDICATION OF A NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nCHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK DEDICATED BY ACT OF CONGRESS--THE SURVIVORS\r\nOF THE GREAT BATTLE NOW BUT FEW--THE REAL CONSECRATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED\r\nBY THE HEROES OF THE FIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe Chickamauga National Park was by act of Congress dedicated\r\nSeptember 19, 1895.  Senators Palmer, of Illinois, and Gordon,\r\nof Georgia, were the orators of the occasion.  The immense audience\r\nassembled included the Governors of twenty States and committees\r\nof both Houses of Congress.  I presided on the occasion, and\r\ndelivered the following address:\r\n\r\n\"I am honored by being called to preside over the ceremonies of\r\nthis day.  By solemn decree of the representatives of the American\r\npeople, this magnificent Park, with its wondrous associations\r\nand memories, is now to be dedicated for all time to national\r\nand patriotic purposes.\r\n\r\n\"This is the fitting hour for the august ceremonies we now inaugurate.\r\nTo-day, by act of the Congress of the United States, the Chickamauga\r\nand Chattanooga National Military Park is forever set apart from\r\nall common uses, solemnly dedicated for all the ages to all the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\n\"The day is auspicious.  It notes the anniversary of one of the\r\ngreatest battles known to history.  Here, in the dread tribunal of\r\nlast resort, valor contended against valor.  Here brave men struggled\r\nand died for the right, 'as God gave them to see the right.'\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-two years have passed, and the few survivors of that\r\nmasterful day--victors and vanquished alike--again meet upon\r\nthis memorable field.  Alas, the splendid armies which rendezvoused\r\nthere are now little more than a procession of shadows.\r\n\r\n  \"'On fame's eternal camping-ground,\r\n  Their silent tents are spread.'\r\n\r\n\"Our eyes now behold the sublime spectacle of the honored survivors\r\nof the great battle coming together upon these heights once more.\r\nThey meet, not in deadly conflict, but as brothers, under one flag,\r\nfellow-citizens of a common country, all grateful to God, that\r\nin the supreme struggle, the Government of our fathers--our common\r\nheritage--was triumphant, and that to all the coming generations\r\nof our countrymen, it will remain 'an indivisible union of\r\nindestructible States.'\r\n\r\n\"Our dedication to-day is but a ceremony.  In the words of the\r\nimmortal Lincoln at Gettysburg:  'But in a larger sense, we cannot\r\ndedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.  The\r\nbrave men living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it\r\nfar above our power to add or detract.'\r\n\r\n\"I will detain you no longer from listening to the eloquent words of\r\nthose who were participants in the bloody struggle--the sharers\r\nalike in its danger and its glory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\nA BAR MEETING STILL IN SESSION\r\n\r\nAPPOINTMENT OF A COMMITTEE TO FORMULATE RULES FOR COURT PROCEDURE--\r\nSOME MEMBERS AGREE TO VOTE DOWN THE MOTION TO ADJOURN--THE\r\nMOTION REJECTED THREE TIMES--INDIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nA Bar meeting recalled by the mention of Mr. Ingersoll would be\r\nworth while if it could only be described as it actually occurred.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the December term of the Circuit Court in Woodford\r\nin the year of grace 'fifty-nine, John Clark, Esq., announced that\r\na meeting of the Bar would be held at the courthouse at \"early\r\ncandle-lighting\" on that very evening, for the purpose of formulating\r\nrules to be presented to the Court for its government during the\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour, the lawyers, \"home and foreign,\" being\r\npromptly in attendance and the court-room crowded, an organization\r\nwas duly effected by the election of Colonel Shope, an able and\r\ndignified barrister of the old school, as President.  As undisputed\r\nspokesman of the occasion, Mr. Clark, at once moved the appointment\r\nof a committee of five to prepare the aforementioned rules.  The\r\nmotion prevailing, _nem. con.,_ in accordance with the time-honored\r\nusage, the mover of the resolution was duly appointed Chairman,\r\nwith Ingersoll, Shaw, Ewing, and the chronicler of these important\r\nevents as his coadjutors.  Upon the retirement of the committee,\r\nthe rules already prepared by Clark were read and promptly approved,\r\nand that gentleman instructed to present them to the Bar meeting\r\n--then in patient waiting.\r\n\r\nAs the recognized parliamentarian of the occasion--with the proposed\r\nrules in safe keeping--was in the van, upon the return to the\r\ncourt-room Ingersoll quietly proposed to his three untitled associates\r\nthat, after the adoption of the resolutions, we should _vote\r\ndown Clark's motion to adjourn_ and thereby remain all night in\r\nsession.  In approved form, and with a dignity that would have done\r\nno discredit to a high-church bishop, the rules were read off by\r\nthe Chairman and agreed to without a dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief silence, Mr. Clark arose and said:  \"Mr. President,\r\nif there is no further business before this meeting, I move we\r\ndo now adjourn.\"  The motion was duly seconded by Welcome P. Brown,\r\nwho had been Probate Judge of McLean County far back in the thirties,\r\nand postmaster of the struggling village of Bloomington when Jackson\r\nwas President.  President Shope promptly arose and in the blandest\r\npossible terms submitted:  \"Gentlemen of the Bar, all who are in\r\nfavor of the motion to adjourn will please say, Aye.\"  Clark, Brown,\r\nand a half-a-dozen others at once voted, \"Aye.\"  \"Those opposed to\r\nthe motion to adjourn will please say, No,\" was the alternative\r\nthen submitted by the impartial presiding officer.  Ingersoll, his\r\nconfederates, and a sufficient contingent won over quietly voted, \"No.\"\r\n\"The motion is lost,\" observed the President, resuming his seat.\r\n\"What is the further pleasure of the meeting?\"  The silence of the\r\ngrave for a time prevailed.  Ingersoll and his followers deporting\r\nthemselves with a solemnity well befitting an occasion for prayer.\r\nAgain arising, the chairman of the committee--in a voice less rotund\r\nthan before--said:  \"Well, Mr. President, if there is no _further_\r\nbusiness before this meeting, I move we do now adjourn.\"  Duly\r\nseconded, the motion was again put, Clark and half a dozen\r\nothers voting as before.  \"Those opposed,\" remarked the President--\r\nin tones perceptibly less conciliatory than an hour earlier--\"will\r\nsay, No.\"  The scarcely audible, but none the less effective \"no\"\r\nprevailed, the leader meanwhile giving no sign and apparently rapt\r\nas if unravelling the mysteries beyond the veil.\r\n\r\nA silence that could be felt now in very truth fell upon the meeting\r\nin the old courthouse assembled.  Even the bystanders seemed\r\nimpressed that something far out of the ordinary was happening.\r\n\r\nReceiving little in the way of encouragement, the Chairman of\r\nthe late committee, as he dubiously looked around upon the forms\r\nof the silent majority--each of whom sat apparently buried in\r\nthought that touched the very depths,--again and for the last time\r\naddressed the presiding officer:\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. President, I move _that we adjourn.\"_\r\n\r\nConclusions being again tried in wonted parliamentary form between\r\nthe opposing forces, with like result as before, the venerable\r\npresident,--by way of prelude first giving full vent to an exclamation\r\nnowhere to be found in the Methodist \"book of discipline,\"--at once\r\nindignantly vacated the chair, and literally shook the dust of the\r\ncourt-room from his feet.  The others \"stood not upon the order of\r\ntheir going,\" and although fifty years have come and gone, that\r\nidentical Bar meeting in the old courthouse at Metamora _is still in\r\nsession,_--never having been officially adjourned even to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\nTHE HAYNE-WEBSTER DEBATE RECALLED\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC CAREER OF LYMAN TRUMBULL--HE HEARS CALHOUN MAKE A MASTERLY\r\nSPEECH IN HIS OWN DEFENCE--TARIFF LAW THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION\r\n--MR. HAYNE'S REPLY.\r\n\r\nEx-Senator Lyman Trumbull called upon me at the Vice-President's\r\nChamber a few months before his death.  It was upon the occasion\r\nof his last visit to Washington.  He pointed out to me with much\r\ninterest the seat he had occupied for many years in the Senate.\r\nThe Senators to whom I introduced him had all come in since his\r\nday.  His associates in that chamber, with three or four exceptions,\r\nhad passed beyond the veil.\r\n\r\nThe public career of Mr. Trumbull began nearly two-thirds of a\r\ncentury ago.  He was distinguished as a judge, and later as an able\r\nand active participant in exciting debates in the Senate, extending\r\nfrom the repeal of the Missouri Compromise to the impeachment of\r\nPresident Johnson.  He was a member when the sessions of the Senate\r\nwere held in the old chamber, and Cass, Crittenden, Douglas, Tombs,\r\nand Jefferson Davis were among his early official associates.\r\nAs Chairman of the Judiciary Committee he had reported the\r\nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my conversation with him upon the occasion\r\nfirst mentioned, I inquired whether he had ever met either Webster,\r\nClay, or Calhoun.  He replied that it was a matter of deep regret to\r\nhim that he had never seen either Clay or Webster, but that he had\r\nin his early manhood heard a masterful speech from Mr. Calhoun.\r\nMr. Trumbull had then just been graduated from an eastern college;\r\nand on his way to Greenville, Georgia, to take charge of a school,\r\nhe spent a few days in Charleston, South Carolina.  This was in\r\n1833, and the speech of Mr. Calhoun was in vindication of his course\r\nin the Senate in voting for the Compromise Bill of Mr. Clay, which\r\nprovided for the gradual reduction of the tariff.  The alleged\r\ninjustice of the tariff law then in force had been the prime cause\r\nof the \"nullification\" excitement precipitated by South Carolina\r\nat that eventful period.  The proclamation of President Jackson,\r\nit will be remembered, proved the death-blow, and the nullification\r\nexcitement soon thereafter subsided.  Mr. Trumbull told me that he\r\ndistinctly recalled John C. Calhoun, his commanding presence and\r\nsplendid argument, as he addressed the large assemblage.  As a\r\nclear-brained logician--whose statement alone was almost unanswerable\r\nargument--he thought Mr. Calhoun unsurpassed by any statesman\r\nour country had known.  Mr. Trumbull added that at the close of\r\nMr. Calhoun's speech before mentioned, amid great enthusiasm,\r\n\"Hayne! Hayne!\" was heard from every part of the vast assemblage.\r\nFor an hour or more he then listened spell-bound to Robert Y. Hayne,\r\nthe formidable antagonist even of Webster in a debate now historic.\r\nMr. Trumbull said that of the two generations of public men he had\r\nheard, he had never listened to one more eloquent than Hayne.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\nIN THE HIGHLANDS\r\n\r\nTHE WRITER THE GUEST OF A GENTLEMAN IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS--\r\nDUNSTAFFNAGE CASTLE--IONA AND SAINT COLUMBA--SENATOR BECK AND\r\nMR. SMITH BOTH DEVOTEES OF BURNS.\r\n\r\nDuring a sojourn of some weeks on the western coast of Scotland,\r\nI was the guest for a time of Mr. Stewart, the head of what remained\r\nof a once powerful clan in the Highlands.  My host was a distinguished\r\nmember of the London Bar, but spent his Summers at the home of his\r\nancestors a few miles out from Alpin.  Here, in as romantic a\r\nlocality as is known even to the Highlands, with his kindred about\r\nhim he enjoyed a full measure of repose from the distracting cares\r\nof the great metropolis.  At the time of my visit his brother,\r\nan officer of the British army, just returned from India, was with\r\nhim.  Both gentlemen wore kilts for the time; and all the appointments\r\nof the house were reminders of bygone centuries when border warfare\r\nwas in full flower, forays upon the Lowlands of constant occurrence,\r\nand the principle of the clans in action,\r\n\r\n  \"Let him take who has the power\r\n  And let him hold who can.\"\r\n\r\nAt the bountifully furnished board of my Highland host there was\r\nmuch \"upon the plain highway of talk\" I will not soon forget.  And\r\nthen, with the gathering shadows in the ancestral hall, with the\r\nrude weapons of past generations hanging upon every wall, and\r\nthe stirring strains of the bagpipe coming from the distance, it\r\nwas worth while to listen to the Highland legends that had been\r\nhanded down from sire to son.\r\n\r\nNot far away was the old castle of Dunstaffnage, which in its prime\r\nhad been the scene of innumerable tournaments and battles that have\r\nadded many pages to Scottish annals.  Within the enclosure of\r\nthe old castle sleeps the dust of long ago kings--the veritable\r\ngrave of Macbeth being readily pointed out to inquiring travellers.\r\n\r\nThe conversation around the hearthstone of my host turned to the\r\nfamous island of the Inner Hebrides, Iona, with its wonderful\r\nhistory reaching back to the sixth century.  The ruins of the\r\nold monastery, built fourteen hundred years ago by the fugitive\r\nSaint, Columba, are well worth visiting.  The dust of the early\r\nkings of Norway, Ireland, and Scotland rest within these ancient\r\nwalls, and it is gratifying to know that here even the ill-fated\r\nDuncan\r\n\r\n  \"After life's fitful fever sleeps well.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been passing strange, with host and guests all of\r\nScottish lineage, if there had been no mention of Robbie Burns,\r\nfor in old Scotia, whether in palace or hovel, the one subject that\r\nnever tires is the \"ploughman poet of Ayr.\"  A little incident\r\nof slightly American relish which I related the evening of my\r\ndeparture needed no \"surgical operation\" to find appropriate\r\nlodgment.\r\n\r\nSenator Beck of Kentucky was a Scotchman.  He was in the highest\r\nsense a typical Scotchman--lacking nothing, either of the brawn,\r\nbrain, or brogue, of the most gifted of that race.  It is needless\r\nto say he was a lover of Burns.  From \"Tam O'Shanter\" to \"Mary\r\nin Heaven,\" all were safely garnered in his memory--to be rolled\r\nout in rich, melodious measure at the opportune moment.  The close\r\nfriend and associate of Senator Beck, when the cares of State were\r\nfor a time in abeyance, and the fishing season at its best, was\r\n\"old Smith,\" superintendent of the Botanical Gardens, also a\r\nScotchman, and likewise in intense degree a devotee of Burns.  The\r\nbond of union between the man of flowers and the Kentucky statesman\r\nwas complete.\r\n\r\nNow, it so fell out that a newly elected member of the House, from\r\nthe Green River district, one day called upon his distinguished\r\ncolleague of the Senate, and requested a note of introduction to\r\nthe superintendent of the Botanical Gardens, as he wished to procure\r\nsome flowers to send a lady constituent then in the city.  \"Certainly,\r\ncertainly,\" replied the ever-obliging statesman:  \"I will give you\r\na line to old Smith.\"  Just as the delighted member was departing\r\nwith the letter in hand, Senator Beck remarked, in his peculiarly\r\nsnappy Scotch accent, \"Now, Tom, if you will only tell old Smith\r\nthat you are a great admirer of his countryman, Robbie Burns, he\r\nwill give you all the flowers in the conservatory.\"  The member,\r\nwho knew as little of Burns as he did of the \"thirty-nine articles,\"\r\ndeparted in high feather.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately thereafter, presenting his letter, he was received\r\nwith great cordiality by the superintendent and assured that any\r\nrequest of Senator Beck would be cheerfully granted.  Just as he\r\nwas reaching out for the fragrant bouquet the superintendent was\r\ngraciously presenting, the closing words of the Senator were\r\nindistinctly recalled, and in a manner indicating no small measure\r\nof self-confidence, the member remarked, \"By the way, Mr. Smith,\r\nI am a great admirer of your countryman, _Jimmy_ Burns.\"  \"Jimmy\r\nBurns!  Jimmy Burns!  Jimmy Burns!\" exclaimed the overwhelmingly\r\nindignant Scotchman, _\"Jimmy_ Burns!  _Depart instantly, sir!\"_\r\n\r\nThe member from Green River district _departed_ as bidden, taking no\r\nthought of the flowers; delighted--as he often asservated--to have\r\nescaped even with his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX\r\nANECDOTES OF LAWYERS\r\n\r\nJUDGE BALDWIN'S BOOK, \"THE FLUSH TIMES\"--DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL ASKS ONE\r\nQUESTION TOO MANY--CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AGAINST A CARD-PLAYER\r\n--JOHN RANDOLPH'S REVENGE--HORACE GREELEY NOT A MINISTER OF THE\r\nGOSPEL--A CANDIDATE'S QUALIFICATIONS FOR SCHOOL-TEACHING--THE AUTHOR\r\nOF \"DON'T YOU REMEMBER SWEET ALICE, BEN BOLT?\"--A CANDIDATE'S\r\nPOSITION WITH REGARD TO THE MAINE LAW--GOVERNOR TILDEN'S POPULARITY\r\n--MR. TRAVERS MISSES A PORTRAIT--A CANDIDATE FOR HOLY ORDERS TELLS\r\nA BIBLE STORY.\r\n\r\nNo better place can be found for studying that most interesting of\r\nall subjects, Man, than in our courts of justice.  Indeed, what a\r\nreadable book that would be which related the best things which\r\nhave occurred at the bar!\r\n\r\nJudge Baldwin conferred an inestimable blessing upon our profession\r\nwhen he wrote \"The Flush Times,\" a book that will hold a place\r\nin our literature as long as there is a lawyer left on earth.\r\nTo two generations of our craft this book has furnished agreeable and\r\ndelightful entertainment.  To the practitioner \"shattered with the\r\ncontentions of the great hall,\" its pages have been as refreshing as\r\nthe oasis to the travel-stained pilgrim.\r\n\r\nThe late Justice Field, long his associate upon the supreme bench of\r\nCalifornia, told me that Judge Baldwin was one of the most genial and\r\ndelightful men he had ever known, and certainly he must have been to\r\nhave written \"Cave Burton,\" \"My First Appearance at the Bar,\" \"A\r\nHung Court,\" and \"Ovid Bolus, Esq., Attorney-at-law and Solicitor in\r\nChancery.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost every Bar has some tradition or incident worth preserving\r\n--something in the way of brilliant witticisms or repartee that\r\nshould not be wholly lost.  Of the race of old-time lawyers--of\r\nwhich Mr. Lincoln was the splendid type--but few remain.  Of the\r\nsurvivors, I know of no better representative than Proctor Knott\r\nof Kentucky.  The possessor of ability of the highest order, and\r\nof splendid attainments as well, he is of all men the best story-teller\r\nthis country of ours has known.  Among his delighted auditors in\r\nand out of Congress have been men from every section and of exalted\r\npublic station.  For some of the incidents to be related I am\r\nindebted to Governor Knott.  The obligation would be much greater if\r\nthe stories could be retold in manner and form as in the days gone\r\nby, and upon occasions never to be forgotten when they fell from\r\nhis own lips.\r\n\r\nIf, however, even fairly well I might garner up and hand down some\r\nof the experiences of the generation of lawyers now passing, I\r\nwould feel that I had, in some humble measure, discharged that\r\nobligation that Lord Bacon says, \"every man owes to his profession.\"\r\n\r\nONE QUESTION TOO MANY\r\n\r\nWhat lawyer has not, at some time, in the trial of a case asked\r\njust _one question_ too many?  I know of nothing better along that\r\nline of inquiry than the following related by Governor Knott.\r\nHe was attending the Circuit Court in one of the Green River counties\r\nin Kentucky, when the case of the \"Commonwealth _versus_ William\r\nJenkins\" was called for trial.  The aforesaid William was under\r\nindictment for having bitten off the ear of the prosecuting witness.\r\nFairly strong but by no means conclusive testimony against the\r\ndefendant had been given when the State \"rested.\"\r\n\r\nA lawyer of the old school, who still carried his green bag into\r\nCourt, and who never wearied of telling of his conflicts at the\r\nbar with Grundy, Holt, and Ben Hardin, in their palmiest days, was\r\nretained for the defence.  His chief witness was Squire Barnhouse,\r\nwho lived over on the \"Rolling Fork.\"  He was the magistrate for\r\nhis precinct, deacon in the church, and the recognized oracle\r\nfor the neighborhood.  Upon direct examination, in the case _at\r\nbar,_ he testified that \"he knowed the defendant William Jenkins; had\r\nknowed him thirty year or more; knowed his father and mother afore\r\nhim.\"  Inquired of then as to the general reputation of the defendant,\r\nas to his being \"a peaceable and law-abiding citizen,\" he was found\r\nto be all that could be reasonably desired.\r\n\r\nSquire Barnhouse was then asked whether he was present at the Caney\r\nFork muster, where it was alleged that the defendant had bitten\r\noff the ear of the prosecuting witness.  It turned out that he was\r\npresent.  Further questioned as to whether he had paid particular\r\nattention to the fight, he replied that he did; that he \"had never\r\nseed Billy in a fout before, and he had a kind of family pride in\r\nseein' how _he would handle himself.\"_  Further questioned as to\r\nwhether he saw the defendant bite off the ear of the prosecuting\r\nwitness he replied, \"No, sir, nothin' uv the kind, nothin' uv the kind.\"\r\nThis was followed by the inquiry as to whether his opportunities were\r\nsuch that he would most probably have seen it, if it had occurred.\r\n\"In course I would, in course I would,\" was the emphatic reply.\r\n\r\nThe witness was here turned over to the Commonwealth's attorney,\r\nwho declined to cross-examine, and Squire Barnhouse was in the act\r\nof leaving the stand when in an evil hour it occurred to defendant's\r\ncounsel to ask one question more.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Squire, _just one more question,_ just where you stand;\r\nnow I understood you to say\"--repeating the answers already given;\r\n\"now just this question, did you see anything occur while the fight\r\nwas going on, or after it was over, that would lead you to believe\r\nthat this defendant had bitten off the ear of the prosecuting\r\nwitness?\"\r\n\r\nThe Squire, half down the witness stand, answered, \"No, sir, nothing\r\nuv the kind,\" then, slowly and thoughtfully, \"nothing uv the kind.\"\r\nA moment's pause.  \"Well, since you mention it, I do remember that\r\njust as Billy rizened up offen him the last time, I seed him spit out\r\na piece of ear, _but whose ear it was,_ I don't pertend to know.\"\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE\r\n\r\nIn the good County of Scotland, in the State of Missouri, back\r\nin the ante-bellum days there lived one Solomon Davis, whose chronic\r\nhorror was card-playing.  The evils of this life were in his judgment\r\nlargely to be attributed to this terrible habit.  It was his belief\r\nthat if the Grand Jury would only take hold of the matter in the\r\nright spirit, a stop could be put to the \"nefarious habit of\r\n_card-playing,_ which was ruining the morals of so many young men in\r\nScotland County.\"  This was the burden of his discourse in and out\r\nof season.  His ardent desire that he himself should be called\r\non the Grand Jury to the accomplishment of the end mentioned was\r\nat length gratified.  At a certain term of court he was not only\r\nsummoned upon the Grand Jury, but duly appointed its foreman.\r\n\r\nUpon the adjournment of court for dinner, immediately thereafter, one\r\nBen Mason, the wit of the bar,--and not himself wholly _unacquainted_\r\nwith the pastime that involved spades, kings, and even queens,--\r\nardently congratulated the new foreman upon his appointment, assuring\r\nhim that now his opportunity had come to put to an end, by the\r\nomnipotent power of the Grand Jury, \"to the nefarious habit of\r\ncard-playing which was ruining the morals of so many young men in\r\nScotland County.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, Squire,\" continued Ben, \"I can give you the name of a\r\ngentleman who doesn't play himself, but is always around where\r\nplaying is going on, and he can tell you who plays, where they\r\nplay, how much is bet, and all about it.\"\r\n\r\nDelighted at this apparently providential revelation, the Squire\r\nhad a subpoena forthwith issued for the witness mentioned, one\r\nRanzey Sniffle, a half-witted fellow who had never taken or expected\r\nto take a part in the game himself, but whose cup of happiness was\r\nfull to the brim when, in return for punching up the fires, mixing\r\nthe drinks, and snuffing the candle, he was permitted _to see\r\nthe play actually going on._\r\n\r\nTrembling with apprehension at the dread summons to appear before the\r\n\"Grand Inquest\"--if it had been three centuries earlier at Saragossa\r\nit could scarcely have appeared more alarming--the witness was\r\nushered into the immediate presence of the awful tribunal over\r\nwhich Squire Davis was now presiding.  After taking the customary oath,\r\nand telling his name, age, and where he lived, Mr. Sniffle was\r\nquestioned by the foreman as to his personal knowledge of any game\r\nor games of cards being played for money, or any valuable thing,\r\nwithin one year last past, within the said County of Scotland, and\r\nsolemnly warned, if he had any such knowledge, to proceed in his\r\nown way, and tell all about it; to tell when and where it was, _who\r\nwere present,_ and what amount, if any, was bet.\r\n\r\nRecovering himself a little by this time, the witness began:\r\n\r\n\"The last time I seed them playin', Squire, was at Levi Myers's\r\nsto'; they sot in about sundown last Saturday night, and never\r\nloosened their grip until Monday mornin' about daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Sniffle,\" interrupted the Squire with great dignity,\r\n\"will you proceed in your own way, to give to the gentlemen of this\r\nGrand Jury _the names_ of the persons who were thus engaged not\r\nonly in violating the statute law of Missouri, but in violating\r\nthe law of God by desecrating the holy Sabbath?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Squire,\" continued the witness, slowly counting off on\r\nhis fingers, \"thar was Levi Myers, Sammy Hocum, Moss Johnson, Josiah\r\nDavis,\"--\"Suspend, Mr. Sniffle, _suspend,\"_ commanded the Squire\r\nwith great indignation, and turning to his official associates, he\r\ncontinued, \"I am aware, gentlemen of the Grand Jury, that my son\r\nJosiah is sometimes present when cards are being played, but he\r\nassures me on his honor as a gentleman, that he never _takes part,_\r\nand doesn't even know one card from another.  Now, Mr. Witness, do\r\nyou undertake, under the solemn sanction of an oath, to say that\r\nmy son Josiah was _engaged_ in the game?  By the way, Mr. Sniffle,\r\ndo you understand the nature of an oath?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Squire,\" slowly replied the witness, \"I dun know as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know _what will become of you,_ Ranze, if you swear to a\r\nlie?\" quickly asked a juryman from a back seat.\r\n\r\n\"Yas, in course, if I swar to a lie, they'll send me to the\r\npenitentiary, and then I'll go to hell afterwards,\" replied Mr.\r\nSniffle.\r\n\r\nThe _competency_ of the witness thus appearing, the foreman\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Sniffle, do you, under the solemn sanction of an oath,\r\nundertake to say that my son Josiah was _engaged_ in that game?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dun know as I adzackly understand the meanin' of bein' engaged in\r\nthe game; but I seed Josiah a-dealin' the papes, when his time come\r\nto fling a card he flung it, and uv'ry now and then, _he rech\r\nout and drug in the chicerokum._  I dun know as I adzackly understand\r\n'bout bein' engaged in the game, but if _that_ were bein' engaged,\r\nthen Josiah were _engaged!\"_\r\n\r\nJOHN RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE\r\n\r\nSeldom have more significant words been uttered than those of John\r\nRandolph of Roanoke, when told that a certain man had been denouncing\r\nhim.  \"Denouncing me,\" replied Randolph, with astonishment, \"that is\r\nstrange, _I never did him a favor.\"_\r\n\r\nThe voice of but one John Randolph of Roanoke has mingled in the\r\ncontentions of the Great Hall.  That was no cause for regret, as\r\nfor a lifetime he was the dread of political foes and friends alike.\r\n\r\nA colleague from \"the valley\" probably remembered him well to\r\nthe last.  That colleague, recently elected to fill a vacancy caused\r\nby the death of a member of long service, signalized his entrance into\r\nthe House by an unprovoked attack upon Mr. Randolph.  The latter, from\r\nhis seat near by, listened with apparent unconcern to the fierce\r\npersonal assault.  To the surprise of all, no immediate reply\r\nwas made to the speech, and the new member flattered himself, no\r\ndoubt, that the \"grim sage\" was for once completely unhorsed.\r\n\r\nA few days later, however, Randolph, while discussing a bill of\r\nlocal importance, casually remarked:  \"This bill, Mr. Speaker, lost\r\nits ablest advocate in the death of my lamented colleague, _whose seat\r\nis still vacant!\"_\r\n\r\nHORACE GREELEY\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the will of Stephen Girard of Philadelphia,\r\nafter a splendid bequest for the establishment of the great University\r\nwhich bears his name, provided that no minister of the Gospel should\r\never be permitted to enter the grounds of the institution.\r\n\r\nIt so happened upon a time, that Horace Greeley, wearing white hat\r\nand cravat, and with his ministerial cast of countenance well in\r\nevidence, sauntered up to the gate of the Girard institution and\r\nwas about to enter.  He was instantly stopped by the keeper, who\r\nbluntly told him that he could not enter.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell is the reason I can't?\" demanded Greeley.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I beg your pardon,\" apologized the astonished gate-keeper,\r\n_\"walk right in, sir; you can.\"_\r\n\r\nPATRIOTIC TO THE CORE\r\n\r\nJudge Allen of southern Illinois, a leading member of Congress a\r\nhalf-century ago, during a recent address to the old settlers of\r\nMcLean County related an incident of early days on the Wabash.\r\nPopulation was sparse, and the common school was yet far in the\r\nfuture.  The teacher who could read, write, and \"cipher\" to the\r\n\"single rule of three\" was well equipped for his noble calling.\r\nLamentable failures upon the part of aspirants to attain even\r\nthe modest standard indicated, were by no means of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nBack in the thirties, an individual of by no means prepossessing\r\nappearance presented himself to Judge Allen's father, the Magistrate,\r\nRuling Elder, and _ex-officio_ school director for his precinct,\r\nand asked permission \"to keep school.\"  Being interrogated as to\r\nwhat branches he could teach, the three R's--readin', 'ritin', and\r\n'rithmetic--were, with apparent confidence, at once put in\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever taught geography and English grammar?\"  was the next\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nWith a much less confident tone, as he had probably never heard of\r\neither, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have teached geography some, but as for English grammar, I wouldn't\r\n'low one of 'em to come into my school-house.  _'Merican grammar\r\nis good enough for me!\"_\r\n\r\n\"SWEET ALICE, BEN BOLT\"\r\n\r\nA touching scene occurred in the House of Representatives a number\r\nof years ago, when an aged member from New Jersey arose, and for\r\nthe first time addressed the Speaker.  All eyes were turned in his\r\ndirection as he stood calmly awaiting recognition.  He was tall,\r\nspare, and erect.  His venerable appearance and kindly expression,\r\ncoupled with most courteous manners, at once commanded attention.\r\nAs in husky tones he again said, \"Mr. Speaker!\" there came from the\r\nfarthest end of the Great Hall in a whisper but distinctly heard\r\nby all, the word, \"Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt.\"  A moment later, and\r\nfrom the floor and gallery many voices blended in the familiar\r\nrefrain, \"Don't you remember sweet Alice Ben Bolt?\"\r\n\r\nThe ovation which immediately followed was such as is rarely\r\nwitnessed in the Great Hall.  Business was suspended for the moment,\r\nand the hand of the new member warmly grasped by the chosen\r\nrepresentatives of all parties and sections.  It was an inspiring tribute,\r\none worthily bestowed.  The member was Thomas Dunn English, author\r\nof the little poem, sung in palace and cottage, which has found\r\nits way into all languages, and touched all hearts.\r\n\r\nTHE MAINE LAW\r\n\r\nThe mention of the \"Maine Law\" recalls a little episode that occurred\r\nin the early days in the good county of McLean.  One Duncan--no\r\nkinsman to him who had been\r\n\r\n  \"So clear in his great office\"--\r\n\r\nwas again a candidate for the Legislature.  The temperance question,\r\nin some of its many phases, was then giving much trouble to aspirants\r\nto public place.  In the midst of his opening speech at the old\r\ncourthouse, the candidate was interrupted by one of the inquisitive\r\nmen who always appear when least wanted, with the question:\r\n\"Mr. Duncan, are you _in favor_ of the Maine Law?\"  \"Yes, yes,\"\r\nquickly replied the candidate, \"I am coming to that very soon.\"\r\nShying off to the tariff, the improvement of Western rivers, and\r\nthe necessity of rigid economy in all public expenditures, our\r\ncandidate was about to close when the same troublesome inquiry,\r\n\"Mr. Duncan, _are you in favor_ of the Maine Law?\"  again greeted his\r\nunwilling ears.  \"Oh, yes,\" exclaimed the orator, in tone and manner\r\nindicating much thankfulness.  \"I am glad you called my attention to\r\nhis subject; I was about to forget it.  My fellow-citizens have\r\na right to know my views upon all public questions, and I have\r\nnothing to conceal.  I have no respect for candidates who attempt to\r\ndodge any of these great questions.  I have given you fully, my\r\nviews upon the tariff, upon a general system of internal improvements,\r\nand something of my own services in the past; and now thanking you\r\nfor your attention, will ----\"  \"Mr. Duncan, are you _in favor of\r\nthe Maine Law?\"_ were the words that again escaped the lips of the\r\nimportunate inquisitor.\r\n\r\nFully appreciating his dilemma--with constituents about equally\r\ndivided upon the dangerous question--the candidate at once\r\nnerved himself for the answer upon which hung his hopes and fears and\r\nboldly replied;  \"Yes, sir, I am in favor of the law, but _everlastingly\r\nopposed to its enforcement!\"_\r\n\r\nHOW HE GOT HIS MAJORITY\r\n\r\nOne of the candidates upon the ticket with Mr. Tilden when he\r\nwas elected Governor of New York, was the late William Dorshemer.\r\nJudge Maynard told me that he was present in the library of Mr.\r\nTilden when Dorshemer called, immediately after the full election returns\r\nhad been received.  Tilden's popularity at the time was very great\r\n--growing out of his successful prosecution of the noted Canal\r\nring,--and resulted in the triumph of the ticket of which he was\r\nthe head.  Mr. Dorshemer, the Lieutenant-Governor elect, was greatly\r\ndelighted that his own majority exceeded that of the more distinguished\r\ncandidate for the Chief Executive office.  During the conversation,\r\nDorshemer remarked to Tilden:  \"Your majority is only fifty thousand,\r\nwhile mine is fifty-one thousand, five hundred.\"  \"Yes, yes,\"\r\nquickly remarked Tilden; \"you got the fifteen hundred; _I gave you\r\nthe fifty thousand!\"_\r\n\r\nWILLIAM R. TRAVERS\r\n\r\nThe generation now passing has known no man of keener wit than the\r\nlate William R. Travers, of New York.  An impediment of speech not\r\ninfrequently gave zest and vim to his words, when they finally\r\nfound utterance.  He was for a lifetime steeped in affairs of great\r\nconcern and among his associates were prominent factors in the\r\ncommercial and political world.\r\n\r\nOn his revisiting Baltimore some years after his removal to New\r\nYork, an old acquaintance remarked, \"You seem to stutter more in\r\nNew York than you did here, Mr. Travers.\"  To this the brief reply\r\nat length came, \"Have to--_it's a bigger place.\"_\r\n\r\nBack in the days when Gould and Fisk were names to conjure with in\r\nthe mart and on the board; when railroads and gold mines were\r\nbut pawns upon the chessboard of \"money changers and those who sold\r\ndoves\"; when \"Black Friday\" was still fresh in the memories of\r\nthousands, this incident is said to have occurred.\r\n\r\nTo weightier belongings, Gould and Fisk had added by way of pastime\r\na splendid steamer to ply between Fall River and New York.  Upon\r\nits trial voyage, Travers was the guest of its owners.  The\r\nappointments of the vessel were gorgeous in the extreme, and in\r\nthe large saloon were suspended life-size portraits of Gould and\r\nof Fisk.  After a promenade of an hour in company with the originals,\r\nTravers suddenly paused in front of the portraits, gazed earnestly\r\nat each in turn, and then--with eyes fixed on the intervening space\r\n--slowly ejaculated:  _\"Where's Christ?\"_\r\n\r\nTOLD BY COLONEL W. D. HAYNIE\r\n\r\nThe following, told with happy effect by Colonel W. D. Haynie of\r\nthe Chicago Bar, probably has no parallel in theological literature.\r\nA colored brother who felt called upon to preach, applied to the\r\nBishop of his church for license to exercise the sacred office.\r\nThe Bishop, far from being favorably impressed by the appearance\r\nof the candidate, earnestly inquired whether he had read the Bible,\r\nand was familiar with appropriate stories to relate, as occasion\r\nmight require, to his Sunday school and congregation.  The answer was,\r\n\"Boss, I has read dat book from led to led.\"  In response to the\r\nrequest of the good Bishop that he would repeat a Bible story, the\r\napplicant for Holy Orders began:\r\n\r\n\"One time dar wus a wicked ole King, an' his name was Ahab; an' he\r\nlive in Babylon; an' he wus a mighty warrior; an' one day he wuz\r\nmarchin' along at de head uv his army fru de streets of Babylon,\r\nan' he seed Bersheby standin' up on de house-top; an' he said to\r\nhis soldiers, 'Bring me Bersheby fur my wife'; an' day brung him\r\nBersheby fur his wife.  An' ole Ahab he march a long ways off, and\r\nfit a big battle, an' tuk a hull lot of prisoners; an' cum\r\na-marchin' back fru de streets of Babylon, wid de brass bans\r\na-playin', and de stars an' stripes a-floatin'; an' Bersheby she wuz\r\na-standin' on de house-top, and she holler out,\r\n\r\n\"'How did you cum out wid' em, old Ahab?'\r\n\r\n\"An' it make him powerful mad you know, an he say to his soldiers,\r\n'Frow her down to me.'  And dey frowd her down to him; and den\r\nhe say, 'Frow her down to me _seven_ times'; and dey frowd her down\r\nseven times; and den he say, 'Frow her down to me _seventy times\r\nseven times!'_ and dey frowed her down to him seventy times\r\nseven times; an' po' ole Bersheby, she crawl away and lay down\r\nat de rich man's gate, and de dogs come and lick her wouns, and\r\nwhen dey gevered he up, dar was 'leven basketfuls left, an' _whose\r\nwife will she be in de resurrection?\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nL\r\nOUR NOBLE CALLING\r\n\r\nTHE LEGAL PROFESSION--TAKEN BY SURPRISE--MISSING THE POINT OF\r\nTHE JOKE--A REMARKABLE INCIDENT--A JUDICIAL DECISION ON BAPTISM--A\r\nDOUBTFUL COMPLIMENT--STRONG PERSONAL ATTACHMENT--IRISH WIT--ENGLISH\r\nJOKES ABOUT LAWYERS--GREATNESS UNAPPRECIATED--ALL IN HIS WIFE'S\r\nNAME--A RETORT BY CURRAN--REMITTING A FINE--A CASE \"ON ALL-FOURS\"--\r\n\"GOING OUT WITH THE TIDE.\"\r\n\r\nAs we well know, lawyers generally entertain an exceedingly exalted\r\nopinion of their profession.  Textbooks, opinions of courts,\r\naddresses innumerable to graduating students, all bear witness\r\nto the fact that our noble profession is the most honorable of\r\nhuman callings, the safeguard of society, the palladium of our\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nTrue, some uncharitable layman has suggested:  \"Yes, all this, and\r\nmore, has been said a thousand times, _but always by lawyers.\"_\r\n\r\nThere are persons yet in life, who, practically at least, hold with\r\nAaron Burr, that \"law is that which is boldly asserted and plausibly\r\nmaintained,\" and that lawyers, like the Roman augurs of old, always\r\nsmile when they meet one another on the street.  The by no means\r\nexalted opinion of two men as to \"our noble profession\" will appear\r\nfrom the following.\r\n\r\nA few days after Knott was admitted to the bar, he was sitting\r\nalone in his office, waiting for clients, when a one-gallowsed,\r\nawkward-looking fellow from the \"brush\" walked in without ceremony,\r\ndropped into the only vacant chair, and inquired:  \"Air you a\r\nlawyer, mister?\"  Assuming the manner of one of the regulars, Knott\r\nunhesitatingly answered that he was.  \"Well,\" said the visitor, \"I\r\nthought I would drap in and git you to fetch a few suits for me.\"\r\nPicking up his pen with the air of a man with whom suing people\r\nwas an everyday, matter-of-course sort of affair, Knott said:  \"Who\r\ndid you wish to sue?\"  To which--with a prolonged yawn--the\r\nprospective client drawled out:  \"I ain't particular, Mister, I\r\njest thought I'd get you to pick out a few skerry fellows _that\r\nwould complemise easy!\"_\r\n\r\nThe remaining incident is an experience of my own, when, at the\r\nage of twenty-two, I had hung out my sign in the then county-seat of\r\nOld Woodford.\r\n\r\nMy first client had retained me to obtain a divorce because of\r\nabandonment during the two years last past by the sometime partner\r\nof his joys and sorrows.  The bill for divorce was duly filed; but\r\non \"the coming in of the answer,\" a continuance of the suit, for\r\ncause shown, was granted to the defendant.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour on the morning thereafter, my client called, and I\r\nsoon discovered he was in a frame of mind by no means joyous.  The\r\ndisappointment he expressed at the continuance of his suit was\r\nevidently sincere.  My explanation of the impossibility of preventing\r\nit, and the confident hope I held out that he would certainly\r\nget his divorce at the next term, evidently gave him little relief.\r\nHe at length intimated a desire to have a confidential talk with\r\nme.  I took him into my \"private office\" (that has a professional\r\nsound, but as a matter of fact my office had but one room, and that\r\nwas \"open as day\" to everybody) and assured him that whatever he\r\nsaid to me would be in the strictest confidence.  Feeling that I\r\nwas on safe ground, I now spoke in a lofty tone of the sacred\r\nrelation existing between counsel and client, and that any\r\ncommunication he desired to make would be as safe as within his\r\nown bosom, \"or words to that effect.\"  Relieved, apparently, by\r\nthe atmosphere of profound secrecy that now enveloped us, he\r\n\"unfolded himself\" to the effect that some years before he had been\r\ndeeply in love with an excellent young lady in his neighborhood,\r\nbut for some trifling cause he could now hardly explain, he had in\r\na pique suddenly turned his attentions to another to whom he was\r\nsoon united in the holy bonds that he was now so anxious to have\r\nsundered by the strong arm of the law.\r\n\r\nA deeply drawn sigh was here the prelude to the startling revelation,\r\nthat since his present sea of troubles had encompassed him about\r\nthe old flame had been rekindled in his heart.  I now candidly\r\ninformed him that I was wholly inexperienced in such matters, but as\r\nhis counsel I would take the liberty to advise him of the monstrous\r\nimpropriety of any visible manifestation or expression of the newly\r\nrevived attachment.  This was followed by the comforting assurance\r\nupon my part, however, that when divorced, he would be lawfully\r\nentitled to re-enter the matrimonial lists in such direction, and at\r\nwhatever gait seemed to him best.  The sigh to which the above was\r\nthe prelude, hardly prepared me for the startling revelation\r\nthat another fellow was now actually keeping company with the young\r\nlady.  My client's feelings here overcame him for a moment, and he\r\ncomplained bitterly of his hard fate in being \"tied up,\" while the\r\ncoast was clear to his competitor.  After a moment of deep study,\r\nhe expressed the opinion in substance, that if his rival could only\r\nbe held in check until the divorce was granted, he was confident\r\nall would be well.\r\n\r\nI here told him that this was all beyond my depth, and along a line\r\nwhere it would be impossible for me to render him any service.\r\nHitching his chair up a little closer, and looking at me earnestly\r\nhe said:  \"You are a good-looking young fellow, and rather a\r\nglib talker, and I will give you this hundred dollars if you will cut\r\nthat fellow out until I get my divorce!\"  Declining with some show\r\nof indignation, as well as surprise--for I was _young_ then in the\r\npractice--I assured him that his proposal was out of the domain of\r\nprofessional service, and could not be thought of for a moment.  In\r\na tone indicating deep astonishment, he said:  \"Why, I thought a\r\nlawyer would do anything for money!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"most anything, but this is the exception; and\r\nbesides, if the young lady is as beautiful as you say she is,\r\nyou would be _in greater danger from me_ at the end of your probation\r\nthan from the other fellow.\"  \"Oh, Lord, I hadn't thought of that,\"\r\nhe exclaimed, as he pocketed his hundred dollars, picked up his\r\nhat, and left my office.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the following term of court, as the decree was\r\nbeing signed granting the divorce aforementioned, I approached\r\nmy client as he sat solitary in the rear of the court-room, and\r\nearnestly congratulated him upon the fact that he was now free and\r\nat liberty to fight his own battles.  \"Yes,\" he replied, with a\r\ngroan that touched the heart of the tipstaff near by, \"but it's\r\ntoo late now; _she married that other fellow last Thursday.\"_\r\n\r\nTAKEN BY SURPRISE\r\n\r\nUpon a time, far back, Ballou, of happy memory, was Judge of the\r\nWoodford Circuit Court.  A young lawyer, after diligent preparation\r\nand exhaustive argument, confidently submitted his first case to\r\nthe tender mercies of the Court.  To his utter dismay, His Honor\r\npromptly rendered a decision adverse to the contention of the\r\nyouthful barrister.  Deeply humiliated by his defeat, the latter\r\nexclaimed:  \"I am _astonished_ at such a decision!\"  The admonition\r\nof a brother, to patience, failing to accomplish its charitable\r\npurpose, the irate attorney asservated more excitedly than before,\r\nhis astonishment at such a decision.  Whereupon the judge\r\nordered the clerk to enter up a fine of five dollars against the\r\noffending attorney for contempt of court.  Silence now reigned\r\nsupreme, and the victim of judicial wrath sank back into his seat,\r\nutterly dismayed.  The strain of the situation was at length\r\nrelieved in part by an old lawyer from the opposite side of the\r\ntrial table, slowly arising and solemnly remarking:  \"Something\r\nmight be said, Your Honor, in extenuation of the conduct of my\r\nyoung friend.  It is his first case, one in which he felt the\r\ndeepest interest, and upon the successful issue of which, he had\r\nfounded his fondest hopes.  I trust Your Honor, upon due reflection,\r\nwill remit this fine.  It is true, he has with much vehemence\r\nexpressed his astonishment at the decision of the Court.  But\r\nhis youth and inexperience must surely be taken into account.  Ah,\r\nYour Honor, when our young brother has practised before this court\r\nas long as some of us have, _he will not be surprised at any decision\r\nYour Honor may make!\"_\r\n\r\nTHE POINT OF THE JOKE\r\n\r\nSydney Smith is credited with saying that it required a surgical\r\noperation to get a joke into a Scotchman's head.  And not a bad\r\nreply is that of the Scotchman:  \"Yes, an _English_ joke.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, however, to cross the Atlantic in order to find\r\na few well authenticated cases where the surgical operation would have\r\nbeen required.  The Hon. Samuel H. Treat, United States Judge of\r\nSouthern Illinois, was one of the ablest and most upright of judges,\r\nand possibly--on or off the bench--the most solemn-appearing of\r\nall of the sons of men.\r\n\r\nThis little incident was related by Judge Weldon.  Soon after\r\nthe close of the War, he one day told Judge Treat a story he had\r\nheard upon a recent visit to Washington.  McDougall, formerly of\r\nIllinois, but at that time a Senator from California, had become\r\nvery dissipated near the close of his term.  At a late hour one\r\nnight a policeman on the Avenue found him in an utterly helpless\r\ncondition--literally in the gutter.  As the officer was making\r\nan ineffectual attempt to get the unfortunate statesman upon his\r\nfeet, he inquired:  \"Who are you?\"  The reply was:  \"This morning I\r\nwas Senator McDougall, but now I am _Sewered!\"_\r\n\r\nA few moments later Mr. Hay came into the office and Judge Treat\r\nsaid:  \"Hay, Weldon has just told me a good story about our old\r\nfriend McDougall.  Mac was in the gutter, and a policeman asked\r\nhim who he was, and Mac told him, 'This morning I was Senator\r\nMcDougall, but now I am the Hon. William H. Seward!'\"\r\n\r\nAN INCIDENT\r\n\r\nUpon the occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary\r\nof the organization of the City of Bloomington, the oration was\r\ndelivered by the Hon. James S. Ewing, late Minister to Belgium.\r\nIn the course of his address, he related the following incident:\r\n\r\n\"In the early history of this county, two boys one day went into\r\nthe old courthouse to hear a lawsuit tried.  There were assembled eight\r\nyoung lawyers, not all of them engaged in the trial, but giving\r\nstrict attention to the proceedings.  It was not a suit of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\"The Court was presided over by Samuel H. Treat, who afterwards\r\nbecame a United States District Judge and one of the most distinguished\r\nlawyers and jurists in the State.\r\n\r\n\"One of the lawyers was David Davis, first a noted lawyer, then\r\na circuit judge, then a judge of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, then a United States Senator and acting President of the\r\nSenate; a citizen of State and national fame whom the people of\r\nBloomington loved and delighted to honor.\r\n\r\n\"Another was John T. Stuart, a brilliant lawyer, several times a\r\nmember of Congress, and one of the most lovable of men.\r\n\r\n\"Another one was David B. Campbell, then the prosecuting attorney and\r\nafterwards a prominent lawyer and citizen of Springfield.\r\n\r\n\"Another was Edward D. Baker, who was afterwards a United State\r\nSenator from Oregon; a famous orator who immortalized himself by\r\nhis marvellous oration over Senator Broderick.\r\n\r\n\"Another was James A. McDougall, a brilliant Irishman, afterwards a\r\nUnited States Senator from the State of California.\r\n\r\n\"And Abraham Lincoln, who has passed beyond the domain of human\r\npraise into the pantheon of universal history.\r\n\r\n\"I might add that one of those boys afterwards became the Vice-President\r\nof the United States; and the other is your speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking to any audience in America, I might say in the world,\r\nI doubt if such an incident could be truthfully related of any\r\nother gathering.\"\r\n\r\nA JUDICIAL DECISION ON BAPTISM\r\n\r\nIt is rarely the case that a Court is called upon to decide questions\r\nof a purely theological character.  Of necessity, however--property\r\ninterests being involved,--controversies, measurably of a religious\r\ncharacter, sometimes arise for judicial determination.\r\n\r\nThe case to be mentioned is probably the only one where \"baptism\"--\r\nthe true mode and manner thereof--has ever come squarely before an\r\nAmerican judge.  A man under sentence of death for murder was\r\nawaiting execution in the jail of one of the counties in\r\nnorthern Kentucky.  Under the ministrations of the pastor of the\r\nBaptist Church, the prisoner at length made \"the good confession\" and\r\ndesired to be baptized.  To this end, the faithful pastor applied to\r\nthe circuit judge before whom the prisoner had been tried, for\r\npermission to have the rite observed in the Kentucky River near\r\nby.  The judge--more deeply versed in \"Blackstone\" and \"Ben Monroe\"\r\nthan in theological lore--declined to have the prisoner removed\r\nfrom the jail, but gave permission to have him baptized in the\r\ncell.  The physical impossibility of the observance of the solemn rite\r\nin the prisoner's cell was at once explained.  \"Certainly,\" said\r\nthe judge in reply, \"I know there is no room in there to baptize\r\nhim that way; but take a bowl of water and sprinkle him right where\r\nhe is confined.\"  \"But,\" earnestly interposed the man of the sacred\r\noffice, \"our church does not recognize sprinkling as valid baptism.\r\nWe hold _immersion_ to be the only Scriptural method.\"  \"Is it\r\npossible?\" exclaimed the judge, greatly surprised.  \"Well, this\r\nCourt decides that sprinkling _is_ valid baptism; and I tell you\r\nonce for all, that that infernal scoundrel will be sprinkled, _or he\r\nwill be hung without being baptized at all!\"_\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this decision has never been _overruled_ by a higher\r\ncourt, it stands as the only judicial determination of the\r\nlong-controverted question.\r\n\r\nA DOUBTFUL COMPLIMENT\r\n\r\nMr. Clark was the leader of the Metamora Bar when I located there--\r\n_and so continued._  My first case, and the compliment of somewhat\r\ndoubtful significance bestowed upon its termination, came about in\r\nthis wise.  I was retained for the plaintiff before Squire Fairchild\r\nin a suit involving the ownership of a calf of the alleged value\r\nof seven dollars.  It being my first case, and having the aforementioned\r\nleader as my professional antagonist--and what was of far greater\r\nconsequence, a contingent fee of two dollars and a half trembling in\r\nthe balance--it may well be supposed that no effort was spared upon\r\nmy part.  I won the case, of course--_what lawyer ever told about a\r\ncase that he had not won?_\r\n\r\nThe same evening a little group in the village store were discussing\r\nthe merits of the case, and comparing the forensic effort of the\r\nnew lawyer with that of the old-time leader already mentioned.  At\r\nlength one Tobias Wilson, as he slid down from his accustomed perch\r\nupon the counter, significantly observed, \"Men, you may say what\r\nyou please, but for my part, I had ruther hear Stevenson speak\r\n_two_ minutes _than to hear old Clark all day!\"_\r\n\r\nSTRONG PERSONAL ATTACHMENT\r\n\r\nMr. Clark--whose early advantages had been none of the best--was\r\nonce counsel for the proponent in a closely contested will case.\r\nThe testator, passing by the next of kin, had left his entire estate\r\nto a personal friend, a man not of his own blood.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to impress upon the jury the reasonableness of\r\nthis disposition, Clark said:  \"This, gentlemen of the jury, is\r\nanother striking illustration of the power of human friendship.\r\nAll history--sacred and profane--is full of instances of strong\r\npersonal attachments.  Who can ever forget the undying affection\r\nof David and Jonathan, of Damon and Pythias, _of Scylla and\r\nCharybdis?\"_\r\n\r\nIRISH WIT\r\n\r\nJudge Baldwin has left of record the witty reply of Jo Heyfron, an\r\nIrish lawyer, to a Mississippi judge.  The judge, having rendered a\r\nvery ridiculous decision in a cause in which Heyfron was engaged, the\r\nlatter slowly arose as if to address the Court.  The judge,\r\nexceedingly pompous and a poor lawyer withal, in imperative tone\r\nsaid:  \"Take your seat, Mr. Heyfron; you have practised at this\r\nbar long enough to know that when this Court renders a decision,\r\nits wisdom can only be called in question in a higher Court.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Your Honor plase,\" replied Jo in deprecatory tone, \"far be\r\nit from me to impugn in the slightest degray the wisdom of Your\r\nHonor's decision.  I only designed to rade a few lines from the\r\nbook I hold in my hand, in order that Your Honor might parsave _how\r\nprofoundly aignorant Sir William Blackstone was upon this subject!\"_\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, at this day, to realize that such scenes could\r\never have been enacted in an English Court, as were not infrequent\r\nduring the era embracing the celebrated \"State Trials.\"  While one\r\nof these was in progress, and Curran in the midst of his argument,\r\nthe judge contemptuously turned his back upon the advocate, and\r\nbegan fondling a favorite dog at his side.  The argument was at once\r\nsuspended.  \"Proceed, sir,\" were the words which at length broke\r\nthe stillness that had fallen upon the vast assemblage.  \"Ah!\"\r\nexclaimed Curran, \"I was only waiting for Your Lordship _to conclude\r\nyour consultation with your learned associate!\"_\r\n\r\nENGLISH JOKES ABOUT LAWYERS\r\n\r\nPossibly the most solemn book in the world, not excepting Burton's\r\n\"Anatomy of Melancholy,\" or even \"Fearne on Contingent Remainders,\"\r\nis an English publication of a half-century or so ago, entitled\r\n\"Jokes about Great Lawyers.\"\r\n\r\nOf several hundred alleged jokes, two or three will bear\r\ntransplanting.\r\n\r\n\"My Lord,\" began a somewhat pompous barrister, \"it is written\r\nthe book of nature ----\"  \"Be kind enough,\" interposed Lord\r\nEllenborough, \"to give me the _page_ from which you quote.\"\r\n\r\nTo the opening remark of an equally pompous barrister:\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, the unfortunate client for whom I appear ----\"  \"Proceed\r\nsir, proceed,\" hastily observed the judge, _\"so far the court is\r\nwith you!\"_\r\n\r\nEllenborough, when at the bar, after protracting his argument to\r\nthe hour of adjournment, said that he would conclude when it should\r\nsuit His Lordship's _pleasure_ to hear him.\r\n\r\nThe immediate reply was:  \"The Court will hear you, sir, to-morrow;\r\nbut as to the pleasure, _that_ had long been out of the question.\"\r\n\r\nGREATNESS UNAPPRECIATED\r\n\r\nGibbon has somewhere said, that one of the liveliest pleasures\r\nwhich the pride of man can enjoy is to reappear in a more splendid\r\ncondition among those who have known him in his obscurity.\r\n\r\nA case in point is a lawyer of prominence in one of the Western\r\nStates, who soon after his appointment to a seat in the Cabinet\r\nrevisited his early home.  Meeting an acquaintance upon his arrival\r\nat the railway station, the visitor, with emotions akin to those\r\ndescribed by Gibbon, ventured to inquire what his old neighbors\r\nsaid when they heard of him being appointed to a place in the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected reply was:  \"Oh, they didn't say nothin'; _they\r\njust laughed!\"_\r\n\r\nALL IN HIS WIFE'S NAME\r\n\r\nThe late Colonel Lynch was for many years the recognized wit of\r\nthe Logan County Bar.  His repeated efforts, upon a time, to collect\r\na judgment against a somewhat slippery debtor, were unavailing;\r\nthe claim of the wife of the debtor, to the property attached,\r\nin each instance proving successful.  Immeasurably disgusted at\r\nthe \"unsatisfied\" return of the third writ, the Colonel indignantly\r\nexclaimed:  \"Yes, and I suppose if he should get religion, he would\r\nhold _that, too,_ in his wife's name!\"\r\n\r\nA RETORT BY CURRAN\r\n\r\nThe stinging retort of the Irish advocate Curran is recalled.\r\nAt the close of his celebrated encounter with one of the most\r\noverbearing of English judges, the latter insultingly remarked\r\nto the somewhat diminutive advocate:  \"I could put you in my pocket,\r\nsir.\"  To which, with the quickness of a lightning flash, Curran\r\nretorted:  \"If you did, Your Lordship would have more law in\r\nyour pocket _than you ever had in your head!\"_\r\n\r\nFiercely indignant, the judge replied:  \"Another word, and I\r\nwill commit you, sir.\"  To which Curran fearlessly retorted:  \"Do,\r\nand it will be the best thing Your Lordship _has committed this\r\nterm!\"_\r\n\r\nREMITTING A FINE\r\n\r\nAbout every courthouse in the \"Blue Grass\" still linger traditions\r\nof the late Thomas F. Marshall.  For him Nature did well her part.\r\nHe was a genius if one ever walked this earth.  Tall, erect,\r\nhandsome, of commanding presence, and with intellectual endowment such\r\nas is rarely vouchsafed to man, no place seemed beyond his reach.\r\nHaving in addition the prestige of family, that counted for much, and\r\nbeing the possessor of inherited wealth, it indeed seemed that\r\nto one man \"fortune had come with both of her hands full.\"  The\r\nsuccessor of Clay and Crittenden as Representative for the Ashland\r\nDistrict, a peerless orator upon the hustings, at the bar, and\r\nin the Great Hall, his life went out in sorrow and disappointment.\r\n\r\n  \"Of all sad words of tongue or pen\r\n  The saddest are these, 'It might have been!'\"\r\n\r\nHis eulogy upon the gifted and lamented Menifee, the tribute of\r\ngenius to genius, belongs to the realm of the loftiest eloquence, and\r\nseldom have words of deeper pathos been written than his own obituary\r\n--\"Poor Tom's a-cold\"--by George D. Prentice.\r\n\r\nAs to why that which seemed so full of promise \"turned to ashes\r\nupon the lips,\" the following will explain.  Meeting his kinsman, the\r\nRev. Dr. Breckenridge, he said:  \"Bob, when you and I graduated,\r\nyou took to the pulpit and I to the bottle, and _I have stuck to\r\nmy text a good deal closer than you have to yours!\"_\r\n\r\nNot inaptly has hell been described as \"disqualification in the\r\nface of opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nBearing in mind Marshall's invariable habit of _not_ paying his\r\ndebts, the point of the closing remark of the judge in the incident\r\nto be related will appear.  Marshall was engaged in the defence of\r\na man charged with murder in a county some distance from his own\r\nhome.  Failing repeatedly in his attempt to introduce certain\r\ntestimony excluded by the Court, he at length exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"It was upon just such rulings as that that Jesus Christ was\r\nconvicted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Clerk, enter up a fine of ten dollars against Mr. Marshall\r\nfor contempt of court,\" was the prompt response of the judge.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Marshall, \"this is the first time in a Christian\r\ncountry I have ever heard of a _man being fined for abusing Pontius\r\nPilate!\"_\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Clerk,\" said the judge, with scarcely suppressed indignation,\r\n\"enter up a fine of twenty-five dollars against Mr. Marshall for\r\ncontempt of court, and the further order that he be imprisoned\r\nin the common jail of the county until the fine and costs are paid.\"\r\n\r\nThe death-like stillness that fell upon the assemblage was at length\r\nbroken by Mr. Marshall arising and gravely addressing the Court.\r\n\r\n\"If Your Honor please, I am engaged in the trial of an important\r\ncase, one where human life may depend upon my efforts.  I have just\r\nbeen fined twenty-five dollars and ordered to be imprisoned until the\r\nfine is paid.  Upon a careful examination of my pockets, I find\r\nthat I have not that amount _nor any other amount_ about my person.\r\nI am more than one hundred miles from home and among strangers.\r\nIn looking over this audience, I find but one familiar face, that of\r\nYour Honor.  I am therefore constrained to request Your Honor,\r\nas an old and cherished friend, _to lend me_ the amount necessary\r\nto discharge this fine.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the judge exclaimed:  \"Remit that fine, Mr. Clerk;\r\n_the State is more able to lose it than I am.\"_\r\n\r\nA CASE \"ON ALL-FOURS\"\r\n\r\nNear two-thirds of a century ago, one of the best-known lawyers in\r\nIllinois was Justin Butterfield.  He was one of the most eloquent of\r\nthe gifted Whig leaders of the State when the list included such\r\nnames as Lincoln, Stuart, Hardin, Browning, Baker, and Linder.  He\r\nwas the earnest champion of General Zachary Taylor for the Presidency\r\nin 1848, and his party devotion was rewarded by appointment to the\r\ncommissionership of the General Land Office.  The only appointment\r\nfor which Mr. Lincoln was ever an applicant was that given to\r\nButterfield soon after the inauguration of President Taylor.\r\n\r\nOf few lawyers have brighter things ever been told than of\r\nJustin Butterfield.  During the fierce anti-Mormon excitement--\r\nwhich resulted in the destruction of the Nauvoo Temple and the\r\nexpulsion of the Mormons from the State--the \"Prophet,\" Joseph\r\nSmith, was placed upon trial for an alleged felony.  The Hon.\r\nNathaniel Pope was the presiding judge, and Butterfield counsel\r\nfor Smith.  A large audience, including many elegantly dressed\r\nladies, was in attendance.\r\n\r\nWhen he arose to address the Court, Butterfield with great dignity\r\nbegan:\r\n\r\n\"I am profoundly impressed with the solemnity of the situation and\r\nthe awful responsibility resting upon me.  I stand in the presence\r\nof his Holiness the Pope, surrounded by angels, _to speak in defence\r\nof the Lord's anointed Prophet!\"_\r\n\r\nWhile in active practice, Butterfield was upon one occasion opposing\r\ncounsel to the Hon. David A. Smith in the Supreme Court of the\r\nState.  The latter had concluded his argument and with head resting\r\nupon the table in front, had fallen asleep while Butterfield was\r\nspeaking.  A gleam of sunlight which had found its way through the\r\nwindow opposite, had fallen upon the very bald head of Smith,\r\ncausing it to shine with unwonted brilliancy.  Suddenly pausing\r\nand with arm extended toward his sleeping antagonist, Butterfield\r\nsolemnly observed:\r\n\r\n\"The light shineth upon the darkness _and the darkness comprehendeth\r\nit not!\"_\r\n\r\nAs the Old State Bank was about to expire by reason of limitation,\r\nthe General Assembly passed a bill extending its corporate life\r\nfifteen years.  In litigation in which Butterfield was counsel,\r\nthe legal effect of the Act mentioned being involved, the opposing\r\ncounsel insisted that the legal effect of said Act was the creation\r\nof a _new_ bank.  Butterfield in reply insisted that \"a new bank\r\nhad not been created, but simply the life of the old one prolonged.\r\nA case in point, your Honor, precisely 'on all-fours' with this,\r\nis the well-authenticated one of the good Hezekiah when the Lord\r\nlengthened out his life fifteen years for meritorious conduct.\r\nNow, sir, did he thereby make a _new_ Hezekiah, _or did he leave\r\nhim just the same old Hezekiah?\"_\r\n\r\n\"GOING OUT WITH THE TIDE\"\r\n\r\nSoldier, lawyer, and wit was Colonel Phil Lee of Kentucky.  When\r\nit is borne in mind that he was of exceedingly small stature the\r\nfollowing incident--one he often related--will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon attaining his majority he was a candidate for the\r\nLegislature.  On election day he was quietly seated on a barrel in\r\nthe room where the election for his precinct was being conducted, when\r\nan old Deacon from the Tan Bark settlement came in to vote.  His\r\nchoice for the State officers and for Sheriff was called out after\r\nsome little parleying as to who were the _best men,_ and the voter\r\nwas about to retire, when one of the judges said,\r\n\r\n\"Deacon, ain't you going to vote for a candidate for the\r\nLegislature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas, of course, I like to forgot all about that; who is running\r\nfor the Legislature?\"\r\n\r\nAt which Phil, hopping down from the barrel, said, \"Deacon, I am\r\na candidate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, _you?\"_ inquired the Deacon--with half contemptuous gaze\r\nat the diminutive-looking aspirant; then turning to the judge he\r\nsaid, _\"Just put me down for the other fellow!\"_\r\n\r\nAdmitted to the bar at Shepherdsville in his native county of\r\nBullitt, when barely of age, his first appearance was as attorney for\r\nthe plaintiff in a breach-of-promise case of much local celebrity.\r\nHis speech held the jury and by-standers literally spellbound, and\r\nit was confidently asserted that the classic banks of Salt River\r\nwill probably never witness such flights of eloquence again.  At\r\nits close Phil was warmly congratulated by an old Squire from\r\nthe \"Rolling Fork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Phil, that was a mighty fine speech, a mighty fine speech, Phil, now\r\nmind, I tell you.  That speech reminded me of Henry Clay.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first mention of _that_ name, the Squire was promptly invited\r\nout to take a drink.  The first round of hospitality happily\r\nconcluded, Phil was in readiness for any additional observations\r\nfrom the Squire.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Phil, when you kinder rared back and throwed your right hand\r\nstraight up, thinks I, Henry Clay, Henry Clay!\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the Squire was without unnecessary delay invited to take\r\nanother drink.  This accomplished, the Squire still held the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Phil, yes, Phil, todes the last when you made that big swoop\r\nwith both arms and 'peared like you was gwyen right up to the\r\nrafters, thinks I, Shore 'nough, Henry Clay come back from his\r\ngrave!\"\r\n\r\nAs flesh and blood could not stand everything, the old Squire\r\nwas promptly invited to take another drink.  Number three being\r\nproperty placed to his credit, the Squire continued:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Phil, you peared to me to be Henry Clay right over again\r\n_with jist one leetle difference.\"_\r\n\r\nAt this Mr. Lee, curious to know what could be the _one_ possible little\r\ndifference, when there were so many points of resemblance between two\r\nsuch orators as himself and Henry Clay, ventured to inquire.  \"I\r\nthink,\" said the Squire, \"this, Phil,--_you peared to kinder lack his\r\nideas!\"_\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the tragic ending of a brilliant career.  Lee, while\r\nCommonwealth's attorney, was in the last stages of that dread\r\ndisease, consumption.  A murder case was on trial in which he felt\r\na deep interest.  The case was one of unusual atrocity, and the\r\naccused--a man of some local prominence--had been exceedingly\r\ndefiant towards the wan and emaciated prosecuting attorney from\r\nits beginning.  With much difficulty Colonel Lee succeeded in\r\ngetting to the court-room in order to make the closing speech to\r\nthe jury.  Utterly exhausted,--after depicting the horrible crime in\r\nall its enormity and demanding the extreme penalty of the law upon\r\nits perpetrator,--at its close, in tones that touched the hearts\r\nof all who heard him, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, I have prosecuted the pleas of this\r\nCommonwealth until the blood has dried up in my veins, and the\r\nflesh has perished from my bones!\"\r\n\r\nThese were his _last_ words--and his life went out that same night\r\njust as the clock struck twelve.  At the self-same hour the steps of\r\nthe jury were heard slowly ascending to the court-room which had\r\nwitnessed his last effort--their verdict, _\"Guilty, the penalty,\r\ndeath!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nLI\r\nTHE \"HOME-COMING\" AT BLOOMINGTON\r\n\r\nMcLEAN COUNTY'S READINESS TO WELCOME HER CHILDREN--HONOR TO THE\r\nEARLY SETTLERS--BEAUTY OF THE COUNTY--ITS PROGRESS--ITS ORGANIZATION\r\n--PRAISE OF JOHN McLEAN--HIS CAREER IN CONGRESS, IN THE ILLINOIS\r\nLEGISLATURE, AND IN THE SENATE--McLEAN COUNTY'S HEROISM--REMINISCENCES\r\nOF THE OLD COURT-HOUSE--FRENCH EXPLORERS IN THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY\r\n--MARQUETTE AND JOLIET EXPLORE THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI--LA SALLE\r\nEXPLORES THE ST.

CLARK CAPTURES KASKASKIA\r\nFROM THE BRITISH--VIRGINIA CEDES TERRITORY, INCLUDING ILLINOIS, TO\r\nTHE UNITED STATES--THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE--ILLINOIS ORGANIZED--\r\nSUMMARY OF SUCCEEDING EVENTS IN THE HISTORY OF ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\nThe McLean County (Illinois) \"Home-Coming\" of June 15, 1907, was\r\nan event of deep significance to all Central Illinois.  On that\r\noccasion I delivered the welcoming address, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"These rare days in July mark an memorable epoch in the history of\r\nthis good county.  The authoritative proclamation has gone forth\r\nthat her house has been put in order, that the latch-string is out\r\n--all things in readiness--and that McLean County would welcome\r\nthe return of all her children who have in days past gone out from\r\nher borders.\r\n\r\n\"In the same joyous and generous spirit in which the welcome was\r\nextended, it has been heeded, and from near and far, from the land\r\nof flowers and of frosts, from the valley of the Osage, the Colorado,\r\nand the Platte, from the golden shores of California, and 'where\r\nrolls the Oregon'--sons and daughters of this grand old county have\r\ngladly turned their footsteps homeward.\r\n\r\n  \"'When they heart has grown weary and thy foot has grown sore,\r\n  Remember the pathway that leads to our door.'\r\n\r\n\"As in the ancient days all roads led to Rome, so in this year\r\nof grace, and in this glorious month of June, all roads lead back to\r\nthe old home; to the hearthstones around which cling the tender\r\nmemories of childhood, and of loved ones gone--to the little mounds\r\nwhere sleep the ashes of ancestral dead.\r\n\r\n\"The 'Home-coming' to which you have been invited will leave its\r\nlasting impress upon all your hearts.  The kindly words that\r\nhave been spoken, the cordial grasp of the hand, the unbidden tear,\r\nthe hospitality extended, have all given assurance that you are\r\nwelcome.  Here, for the time, let dull care and the perplexities\r\nthat environ this mortal life be laid aside, let whatever would in\r\nthe slightest mar the delight of this joyous occasion be wholly\r\nforgotten; so that in the distant future, to those who return and to\r\nthose who stay, the recollection of these days will be one of\r\nunalloyed pleasure; and so that, when in the years to come we tell\r\nover to our children of the return to the old home, this reunion\r\nwill live in our memories as one that, like the old sun-dial,\r\n'marked only the hours which shine.'\r\n\r\n\"No place so fitting for this home-coming could have been selected\r\nas this beautiful park, where the springing grass, transparent\r\nlake, and magnificent grove--'God's first temple'--seem all to join\r\nin welcoming your return.  How, from a mere hamlet, a splendid city\r\nhas sprung into being during the years of your absence!  No longer\r\na frontier village, off the great highway of travel, with the mail\r\nreaching it semi-weekly by stage-coach or upon horseback,--as our\r\nfathers and possibly some who now hear me may have known it,--it\r\nis now 'no mean city.'  Its past is an inspiration; its future\r\nbright with promise.  It is in very truth a delightful dwelling-place\r\nfor mortals, and possibly not an unfit abiding-place for saints.\r\nWhoever has walked these streets, known kinship with this people, called\r\nthis his home--wherever upon this old earth he may since have\r\nwandered--has in his better moments felt an unconquerable yearning\r\nthat no distance or lapse of time could dispel, to retrace his\r\nfootsteps and stand once more within the sacred precincts of his\r\nearly home.  Truly has it been said:  'No man can ever get wholly\r\naway from his ancestors.'  Once a Bloomingtonian, and no art of\r\nthe enchanter can dissolve the spell.  'Once in grace, always in\r\ngrace,' whatever else may betide!  Eulogy is exhausted when I\r\nsay that this city is worthy to be the seat of justice of the grand\r\nold county of which it is a part.\r\n\r\n\"Upon occasion such as this, the spirit of the past comes over\r\nus with its mystic power.  The years roll back, and splendid farms,\r\nstately homes, magnificent churches, and the marvellous appliances\r\nof modern life are for the moment lost to view.  The blooming\r\nprairie, the log cabin nestling near the border-line of grove or\r\nforest, the old water-mill, the cross-roads store, the flintlock\r\nrifle, the mould-board plough, the dinner-horn,--with notes sweeter\r\nthan lute or harp ever knew,--are once more in visible presence.\r\nAt such an hour little stretch of the imagination is needed to\r\nrecall from the shadows forms long since vanished.  And what\r\ntime more fitting can ever come in which to speak of those who have\r\ngone before,--of the early settlers of this good county?\r\n\r\n\"It was from the beginning the fit abode for men and women of God's\r\nhighest type--and such, indeed, were the pioneers.  Their early\r\nstruggles, their sacrifices, all they suffered and endured, can\r\nnever be fully disclosed.  But to them this was truly 'the promised\r\nland'--a land they might not only view, but possess.  From New\r\nEngland, Ohio, the 'Keystone,' and the 'Empire' State, from the\r\nbeautiful valley of the Shenandoah and the Commonwealths lying\r\nwestward and to the south, came the men and women whose early homes\r\nwere near the banks of the little streams and nestled in the shades\r\nof the majestic groves.  Here they suffered the hardships and\r\nendured the privations that only the frontiersman might know.  Here\r\nbeneath humble roofs, their children were born and reared, and here\r\nfrom hearts that knew no guile ascended the incense of thanksgiving\r\nand praise.  The early settlers, the pioneers, the men who laid\r\nthe foundations of what our eyes now behold, builded wisely and\r\nwell.  Their descendants to-day are in large measure the beneficiaries\r\nof all that they so wisely planned, so patiently endured.  These\r\nnames and something of what they achieved will go down in our annals\r\nto the after times.  Peace to their ashes; to their memory all\r\nhonor!  They were the advance guard--The builders--and faithfully and\r\nwell they served their race and time.  Upon nobler men and women\r\nthe sun in all his course hath nowhere looked down.\r\n\r\n\"And where upon God's footstool can domain more magnificent than\r\nthis good county be found; one better adapted to the habitation of\r\ncivilized man?  The untrodden prairies of three-quarters of a\r\ncentury ago, as if touched by the wand of magic, have become splendid\r\nfarms.  And groves more beautiful the eye of man hath not seen.\r\n\r\n\"Containing a population of less than two thousand at the time\r\nof its organization, there are more than seventy thousand souls\r\nwithin the bounds of this good county to-day.  The log cabin has\r\ngiven way to the comfortable home.  The value of farm lands and\r\ntheir products have increased beyond human forecast or dream.\r\nAs shown by the last Governmental report, McLean County contains\r\nfour thousand eight hundred and seventy-three farms, aggregating\r\nseven hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred and seventy-eight\r\nacres.  The corn product for the year 1899 exceeded fifteen millions\r\nof bushels, being near one-twentieth of that of the entire State.\r\nIn the value of its agricultural products it is third upon the list\r\nof counties in the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The life of the farmer is no longer one of drudgery and isolation.\r\nModern conveniences and appliances have in large measure supplanted\r\nthe hard labor of human hands, lessened the hours of daily toil,\r\nand brought the occupant of the farm into closer touch with the\r\nouter world.  More than all this, our schoolhouses, universities,\r\nchurches, and institutions for the relief of the unfortunate and\r\ndependent, all bear witness to the glad fact that in our material\r\ndevelopment the claims of education, of religion, of charity, have\r\nnot been forgotten.  It is our glory, that in all that tends to human\r\nprogress, in all that ministers to human distress, in whatever appeals\r\nto and develops what is best in man, or brings contentment and happiness\r\nto the home--in a word, in the grand march of civilization--McLean\r\nCounty moves in the van.\r\n\r\n\"Possibly no occasion more fitting can arise in which briefly to\r\nspeak of the organization of McLean County, and something of\r\nimportant events of its history.  At the session of the Legislature\r\nat Vandalia in the winter of 1830-31, a petition--borne to the\r\nState capital by Thomas Orendorff and James Latta--was duly presented,\r\npraying for the organization of a new county to be taken from\r\nTazewell and Vermilion.  The territory embraced in the proposed\r\ncounty included the present limits of McLean and large portions of\r\nneighboring counties organized at a later day.  In accordance with\r\nthe petition, a bill was passed, and its approval by the Governor on\r\nthe twenty-fifth day of December, 1830, marks the beginning of the\r\nhistory of this good county.\r\n\r\n\"The name of 'McLean' was adopted upon the motion of the Hon.\r\nWilliam Lee D. Ewing, some of whose kindred have for many years\r\nbeen residents of this city.  Mr. Ewing had been the close friend of\r\nthe man whose name he thus honored, and was himself in later years\r\na distinguished Senator in Congress.\r\n\r\n\"By the terms of the bill mentioned, the seat of justice of said\r\ncounty was to be 'called and known by the name of Bloomington.'\r\nIt was further provided that until otherwise ordered the courts of\r\nsaid county should be held at the house of James Allen.  The first\r\nterm of the Circuit Court was held in April, 1831, at the place\r\nindicated, the historic 'Stipp House,' but recently standing, a\r\npathetic reminder of by-gone days.  The presiding judge of that\r\ncourt was the Hon. Samuel D. Lockwood, of Springfield--an able and\r\neminent jurist of spotless record.  By legislative enactment, five\r\ntimes since its organization, valuable portions of McLean--aggregating\r\nnearly four-sevenths of its original territory--have been carved\r\nin the formation of the counties of Logan, Livingston, Piatt,\r\nDe Witt, and Woodford.  Notwithstanding all this, McLean County yet\r\nremains--and by constitutional inhibition and the wisdom of our\r\npeople will for all time remain--the largest county in the State.\r\n\r\n\"A word now of the man whose name was upon every invitation to this\r\nhome-coming, in honor of whom this county was named, John McLean, one\r\nof the ablest and most distinguished of the first generation of\r\npublic men in Illinois.  Born in North Carolina in 1791, his early\r\nyears were spent in Kentucky.  In the last-named State he studied law\r\nand was admitted to the Bar.  He removed to Illinois in 1815 and\r\nlocated in Shawneetown upon the Ohio River for the practice of his\r\nprofession.  The county of Gallatin, his future home, was then one\r\nof the most populous in the Illinois Territory.  In fact, at the\r\ntime mentioned, and for some years after the organization of the\r\nState, there were few important settlements one hundred miles north\r\nof the Ohio River.\r\n\r\n\"In the largest degree Mr. McLean was gifted with the qualities\r\nessential to popular leadership in the new State.  He was present at\r\nall public assemblages whether convened for business or pastime,\r\nand a leading spirit in all the amusements and sports of the hour.\r\nBut 'men are as the time is.'  At all events, if the testimony\r\nof his contemporaries is to be taken, his popularity knew no bounds.\r\nThe late General McClernand, his fellow-townsman, said of Mr.\r\nMcLean:\r\n\r\n\"'His personality interested and impressed me.  The image of it\r\nstill lingers in my memory.  Physically, he was well developed,\r\ntall, strong, and stately.  Socially, he was affable and genial,\r\nand his conversation sparkled with wit and humor.'\r\n\r\n\"The following words of another contemporary, Governor Reynolds,\r\nare of interest:\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. McLean was a man of gigantic mind, of noble and manly form, and\r\nof lofty, dignified bearing.  His personality was large, and formed\r\non that natural excellence which at all times attracted the attention\r\nand admiration of all beholders.  The vigor and compass of his\r\nintellect was exceedingly great, and his eloquence flowed in\r\ntorrents, deep, strong, and almost irresistible.'\r\n\r\n\"At the election immediately succeeding the adoption of the\r\nConstitution under which Illinois was admitted into the Union, Mr.\r\nMcLean was chosen the Representative in Congress.  Soon thereafter,\r\nhe presented to the House of Representatives the State Constitution\r\nthen recently adopted at Kaskaskia; and upon its formal acceptance\r\nby that body, Mr. McLean was duly admitted to his seat as the first\r\nRepresentative from Illinois in the Congress of the United States.\r\nHe was defeated for re-election by the Hon. Daniel P. Cook, one of\r\nthe most gifted men Illinois has known at any period of her history.\r\n\r\n\"Rarely have men of greater eloquence than Cook and McLean been\r\nantagonists in debate either upon the hustings or in the halls\r\nof legislation.  With the people of the entire State for an audience,\r\nthe exciting issues of that eventful period were argued with an\r\neloquence seldom heard in forensic discussion.  In very truth, each\r\nwas the worthy antagonist of the other.  It is not too much to say\r\nthat, with the single exception of the masterful intellectual combat\r\nmore than a third of a century later between Lincoln and\r\nDouglas, Illinois has been the theatre of no greater debate.\r\n\r\n\"Upon his retirement from Congress, Mr. McLean was elected to\r\nthe Lower House of the Illinois Legislature and subsequently chosen\r\nSpeaker of that body.  The valuable service he there rendered is\r\nan important part of the early history of the State.  He resigned the\r\nspeakership in order the more effectually to lead the opposition\r\nto a bill chartering a State bank.  His predictions as to the evils\r\nto the state, of which the proposed legislation would be the sure\r\nforerunner, were more than verified by subsequent events.  More\r\nthan a decade had passed before the people were relieved of the\r\nfinancial ills which John McLean ineffectually sought to avert.\r\nNo other evidence of his statesmanship is needed than his masterly\r\nspeech in opposition to the ill-timed legislation I have indicated.\r\n\r\n\"Apart from the fact that his name is continually upon our lips,\r\nthe career of Mr. McLean is well calculated to excite our profound\r\ninterest.  During the fifteen years of his residence in Illinois, he\r\nheld the high position of Representative in Congress, Speaker of\r\nthe popular branch of the State Legislature, and was twice elected\r\nto the Senate of the United States.  At his last election he received\r\nevery vote of the joint session of the General Assembly--an honor of\r\nwhich few even of the most eminent of our statesmen have been\r\nthe recipients.\r\n\r\n\"His personal integrity was beyond question, and it may truly be\r\nsaid of him that he ably and faithfully discharged every public\r\nduty.  He died at the early age of thirty-nine, the period when,\r\nto most public men, a career of usefulness and distinction has\r\nscarcely begun.  Upon the occasion of the announcement of his death\r\nto the Senate his colleague, Senator Kane, paid an eloquent tribute\r\nto his lofty character, his ability, and his worth, and deplored\r\nthe loss his State had sustained in his early death.\r\n\r\n\"He lies buried in the State that had so signally honored him, near\r\nthe beautiful river upon whose banks he found a home when Illinois\r\nwas yet a wilderness.  Such, in brief, was the man McLean, whose\r\nhonored name this good county will hand down to the after times.\r\nNo higher tribute need be paid to his memory than to say, his name\r\nwas worthy of this magnificent domain to which it was given.\r\n\r\n\"In no part of this broad land has there been more prompt response\r\nthan in this to the authoritative call to arms.  In the largest\r\nmeasure McLean County has met every requirement that patriotism\r\ncould demand.  Full and to overflowing has been her contribution\r\nof means and men.\r\n\r\n\"In almost the last struggle with the savage foe, as he burned his\r\nwigwam and disappeared before the inexorable advance of civilized men;\r\nin the War with Mexico, by which States were added to our national\r\ndomain; in that of the great Rebellion, where the life of the nation\r\nwas at stake, and in our recent conflict with Spain--four times\r\nduring a history that spans but a single life, McLean County has\r\nsent her full quota of soldiers to the field.  Few survive of the\r\ngallant band who stood with Bissell and Hardin at Buena Vista,\r\nor followed Shields and Baker through the burning sands from the\r\nGulf to the City of Mexico.  And at each successive reunion of\r\ncomrades in the great civil strife, there are fewer, and yet fewer,\r\nresponses to the solemn roll-call.\r\n\r\n  \"'On Fame's eternal camping-ground,\r\n  Their silent tents are spread.'\r\n\r\n\"And what a record is that of this glorious county during the\r\neventful years of '61-'65!  With a population of but forty per cent\r\nof that of to-day, more than four thousand of her brave sons marched\r\ngallantly to the front.  They gathered from farm, from shop,\r\nfrom mart and hall--to die, if need be, that their country might\r\nlive.  On many fields now historic, where brave men struggled\r\nand died, soldiers from this grand county were steadily in line.\r\nAlong every pathway of danger and of glory they were to be found.\r\nIn every grade of rank were heroes as knightly as ever fought\r\nbeneath a plume.  Even to name the heroes that old McLean equipped\r\nfor the great conflict would be but to call over her muster rolls of\r\nofficers and men.\r\n\r\n\"The chords of memory are touched as the vision of the Old Courthouse\r\nrises before us.  Its walls were the silent witnesses of events\r\nthat would make resplendent the pages of history.  Here assembled lawyers,\r\norators, statesmen, whose names have been given to the ages.  Here,\r\nat a critical period in our history the great masters of debate\r\ndiscussed vital questions of state--questions that took hold of\r\nthe life of the republic.  Here, at times, debate touched the\r\nsprings of political power.  Here in the high place of authority\r\nsat one destined later to wear the ermine of the greatest court\r\nknown to men.  During his membership of that court in the eventful\r\nyears immediately following the great conflict, questions novel\r\nand far-reaching pressed for determination; questions no less\r\nimportant than those which had in the infancy of the republic\r\nexhausted the learning of Marshall and its associates.  It is\r\nour pride that our townsman, David Davis, was among the ablest\r\nof the great court, by whose adjudication renewed vigor was given to\r\nthe Constitution, and enduring safeguards established for national\r\nlife and individual liberty.\r\n\r\n\"To the Old Courthouse in the early days came the talented and\r\ngenial James A. McDougall, then just upon the threshold of a brilliant\r\ncareer, which culminated in his election as a Senator from California;\r\nalso John T. Stuart, the able lawyer and gentleman of the old\r\nschool.  He was a Representative in Congress more than two-thirds of\r\na century ago, when his district embraced all Central and Northern\r\nIllinois--extending from a line fifty miles south of Springfield to\r\nChicago and Galena.  In Congress he was the political associate\r\nand friend of Webster, of Crittenden, and of Clay.  Many years ago,\r\nupon the occasion of Mr. Stuart's last visit to Bloomington, he\r\ntold me, as we stood by the old 'Stipp' home, that he there, in\r\n1831, witnessed the beginning of the judicial history of McLean\r\nCounty, when Judge Lockwood opened its first court.  With deep\r\nemotion he added that he was probably the last survivor of those\r\nthen assembled, and that his own days were almost numbered.  His\r\nwords were prophetic, as but a few months elapsed before he,\r\ntoo, had passed beyond the veil.  There came also Edward D. Baker,\r\nRepresentative from Illinois and Senator from Oregon.  To him Nature\r\nhad been lavish with her gifts.  His eloquence cast a spell about all\r\nwho heard him.  As was said of the gifted Prentiss:  'the empyrean\r\nheight into which he soared was his home, as the upper air the\r\neagle's.'  Our language contains few gems of eloquence comparable to\r\nthis wondrous eulogy on the lamented Broderick.  His own tragic\r\ndeath in one of the early battles of the great war cast a gloom over\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n\"In his official capacity as prosecuting attorney came also to the\r\nOld Courthouse the youthful Stephen A. Douglas.  A born leader\r\nof men, with a courage and eloquence rarely equalled, he was\r\nwell equipped for the hurly-burly of our early political conflicts.\r\nSave only in his last great contest, he was a stranger to defeat.\r\nPublic Prosecutor, Member of the Legislature, and at the age of\r\ntwenty-eight Judge of the Supreme Court of the State; later a\r\nRepresentative, and at the age of thirty-three a Senator in Congress.\r\nAmid storms of passion such as, please God, we may not see again,\r\nhe there held high debate with Seward, Chase, and Sumner; and\r\nmeasured swords with Tombs, Benjamin, and Jefferson Davis upon\r\nvital issues which, transferred later from forum and from Senate, were\r\nto find bloody arbitrament by arms.  Beginning near the spot where\r\nwe have to-day assembled, the career of Douglas was indeed marvellous.\r\nDefeated for the great office which had been the goal of his\r\nambition; amid the war-clouds gathering over the nation, and the\r\nyet darker shadows falling about his couch, he aroused himself\r\nto the last supreme effort, and in words that touched millions of\r\nresponsive chords, adjured all who had followed his political\r\nfortunes to know only their country in its hour of peril.  With\r\nhis pathetic words yet lingering, and 'before manhood's morning\r\ntouched its noon,' Douglas passed to the great beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Out of the shadowy past another form is evoked, familiar once\r\nto some who hear me now.  Another name, greater than any yet spoken,\r\nis upon our lips.  Of Abraham Lincoln the words of the great orator,\r\nBossuet, when he pronounced his matchless elegy upon the Prince of\r\nConde, might truly be spoken:\r\n\r\n\"'At the moment I open my lips to celebrate the immortal glory\r\nof the Prince of Conde, I find myself equally overwhelmed by the\r\ngreatness of the theme and the needlessness of the task.  What part\r\nof the habitable globe has not heard of the wonders of his life?\r\nEverywhere they are rehearsed.  His own countrymen, in extolling\r\nthem, can give no information even to the stranger.'\r\n\r\n\"Of Lincoln no words can be uttered or withheld that could add\r\nto or detract from his imperishable fame.  His name is the\r\ncommon heritage of all people and all times.\r\n\r\n\"When in the loom of time have such words been heard above the din\r\nof fierce conflict as his sublime utterances but a brief time before\r\nhis tragic death?\r\n\r\n\"'With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness\r\nin the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to\r\nfinish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care\r\nfor him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and\r\nhis orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and\r\nlasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.'\r\n\r\n\"The men who knew Abraham Lincoln, who saw him face to face, who\r\nmet him upon our streets, and heard his voice in our public\r\nassemblages have, with few exceptions, passed to the grave.  Another\r\ngeneration is upon the busy stage.  The book has forever closed\r\nupon the dread pageant of civil strife.  Sectional animosities,\r\nthank God, belong now only to the past.  The mantle of peace is\r\nover our entire land, and prosperity within all our borders.\r\n\r\n  \"'Till the war-drum throbs no longer,\r\n  And the battle-flags are furled\r\n  In the parliament of man,\r\n  The federation of the world.'\r\n\r\n\"Through the instrumentality in no small measure of the man personally\r\nknown to some who hear me, the man McLean County delighted to honor,\r\nno less as a private citizen than as President, this Government,\r\nuntouched by the finger of time, has descended to us.  Let it never\r\nbe forgotten that the responsibility of its preservation and\r\ntransmission will rest upon the successive generations of his\r\ncountrymen, as they shall come and go.\r\n\r\n\"Truly it has been said:  'To-day is the pupil of yesterday,'\r\nand also 'History is the great teacher of human nature by means of\r\nobject-lessons drawn from the whole recorded life of human nature.'\r\nThere is, then, no dead past.  Every event is in a measure significant.\r\nThe annals of the ambitions, the crimes, the miseries, the wrongs,\r\nthe struggles, the achievements of men in the long past are fraught\r\nwith lessons of deep import to all succeeding generations.  Each\r\nage is the heir to that which preceded.  We make progress in\r\nproportion as we wisely ponder significant events.\r\n\r\n\"McLean County had its historical beginning as a dependent but\r\ndistinct political organization on the joyous Christmas Day of\r\n1830.  Stretching backward from that date, its history is bound up\r\nsolely in that of Illinois, under its various organizations and\r\nnames.  A brief time upon occasion such as this given to a hurried\r\nreview of the masterful epochs in the history of the great State\r\nof which our own county is so important a part, cannot be wholly\r\nmisspent.\r\n\r\n\"Bearing in mind that 'that which comes after ever conforms to that\r\nwhich has gone before,' significant events of the past must be\r\nknown, to the end that we intelligently comprehend the present,\r\nand are enabled, even in scant measure, to forecast the future.\r\n\r\n\"No State of the American union has a history of more intense\r\ninterest than our own.  Its early chapters, indeed, savor of the\r\nromantic rather than of the real.  I do not speak of the long-ago time\r\nwhen Illinois forest and prairie were the house and hunting-ground\r\nof the red men, and his frail bark the only craft known to its\r\nrivers.  That period belongs to the border-land age of tradition\r\nrather than of veritable history.  It is of Illinois under the\r\ndomination of civilized men I would speak.\r\n\r\n\"For near a century preceding the Treaty of Paris in 1763, 'the\r\nIllinois country' was a part of the French domain.  Inseparably\r\nlinked with that portion of its history are names that will live\r\nwith those of the Cabots and Columbus.  The great navigator in his\r\nlonely search for a new pathway to the Indies was buoyed by a\r\ncourage, a yearning for discovery, scarce greater than that which in\r\nthe heart of the new continent sustained the later voyagers and\r\ndiscoverers, Marquette, Joliet, Hennepin, and La Salle.\r\n\r\n\"America's obligation to France is enduring--for explorers in\r\nthe seventeenth century no less than for defenders in that which\r\nimmediately followed.  The historic page which tells of the\r\nlofty heroism of Lafayette has for us no deeper interest than that\r\nwhich records the daring achievements of the early French pathfinders\r\nand voyagers.  Two centuries and a half ago Marquette and\r\nJoliet, bearing the commission of the French Governor of Quebec,\r\nembarked upon their expedition for the discovery of new countries to\r\nthe southward.  Animated by the earnest desire of extending the\r\nblessings of religion no less than that of adding to the domain of\r\ntheir imperial master, they set out upon an expedition which has\r\nbecome historic.  The bare recital of what befell them would\r\nfill volumes.  Now meeting with the scattered tribes of Indians,\r\nbestowing presents and in turn sharing the hospitality offered;\r\nnow speaking words of admonition and of instruction; now gathering\r\nup the crude materials for history; now reverently setting up\r\nthe cross in the wilderness; again threading the pathless forests,\r\nor in frail barks sailing unknown waters, they pursued their perilous\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\"In time, after looking out upon the waters of Lake Michigan,\r\ncrossing Lake Winnebago, visiting the ancient villages of the\r\nKickapoos, 'with joy indescribable,' as Marquette declared, they\r\nfor the first time beheld the Mississippi.  In June, 1673, upon\r\nthe east bank of the great river, they landed upon the soil of what\r\nis now the State of Illinois.  At the little village they first\r\nvisited they received hospitable treatment.  Its inmates are known\r\nin our early history as 'the Illini'--a word signifying _men._\r\nThe euphonic termination added by the Frenchmen gives us the\r\nname Illinois.  It is related that, upon the first appearance of\r\nMarquette and Joliet at the door of the principal wigwam of the\r\nvillage, they were greeted by an aged native with the words:  'The\r\nsun is beautiful, Frenchmen, when you come to visit us; you\r\nshall enter in peace into all our cabins; it is well, my brothers,\r\nyou come.'  In the light of the marvellous results of the visit,\r\nthe words of the aged chieftain seem prophetic.  We, too, may say it\r\nwas well they came.\r\n\r\n\"The glory of having discovered the upper Mississippi and the valley\r\nwhich bears its name belongs to Marquette and Joliet.  It was theirs\r\nto add the vast domain under the name 'New France' to the empire\r\nof _le Grand Monarque._  In very truth a princely gift.  But no\r\nhistory of the great valley and the majestic river would be complete\r\nwhich failed to tell something of the priest and historian, Hennepin,\r\nand of the knightly adventures of the Chevalier La Salle.\r\n\r\n\"Much, indeed, that is romantic surrounds the entire career of\r\nLa Salle.  Severing his connection with a theological school in\r\nFrance, his fortunes were early cast in the New World.  From Quebec,\r\nthe ancient French capital of this continent, he projected an\r\nexpedition which was to add empire to his own country and to cast a\r\nglamour about his own name.  It has been said that his dream was\r\nof a western waterway to the Pacific Ocean.  In 1669, with an outfit\r\nthat had cost him his entire fortune, with a small party he ascended\r\nin canoes the St. Lawrence, and a few weeks later was upon the broad\r\nOntario.  Out of the mists and shadows that enveloped much of\r\nhis subsequent career, it were impossible at all times to gather\r\nthat which is authentic.  It is enough that, with Hennepin as one of\r\nhis fellow-voyagers, he reached the Ohio and in due time navigated\r\nthe Illinois, meantime visiting many of the ancient villages.\r\n\r\n\"But his great achievement--and that with which abides his imperishable\r\nfame--was his perilous descent of the Mississippi from the Falls\r\nof St. Anthony to the Gulf of Mexico.  On the sixth day of April, 1682,\r\nupon the east bank of the lower Mississippi, with due form and\r\nceremony and amid the solemn chanting of the _Te Deum_ and the\r\nplaudits of his comrades, La Salle took formal possession of the\r\nLouisiana country in the name of his royal master, Louis the\r\nFourteenth of France.\r\n\r\n\"For the period of ninety-two years, beginning with the discoveries\r\nof Marquette and Joliet, the Illinois country was a part of the\r\nFrench possessions.  Sovereignty over the vast domain of which\r\nit was a part was exercised by the French King through his commandant\r\nat Quebec.  But as has been truly said, 'The French sought and\r\nclaimed more than they had the ability to hold or possess.  Their line\r\nof domain extended from the St. Lawrence around the Great Lakes and\r\nthrough the valley of the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, a\r\ndistance of over three thousand miles.'  Truly a magnificent domain,\r\nbut one destined soon to pass forever from the possession of the\r\nFrench monarch and his line.\r\n\r\n\"The hour had struck, and upon the North American continent the\r\nancient struggle for supremacy between France and her traditional enemy\r\nwas to find bloody arbitrament.  Great Britain claimed as a part\r\nof her colonial possessions in the New World the territory bordering\r\nupon the Great Lakes and the rich lands of the Ohio and Mississippi\r\nvalleys.  As to the merits of the French and English contention as\r\nto superior right by discovery or conquest, it were idle now to\r\nargue.  Our concern is with the marvellous results of the long-continued\r\nstruggle which for all time determined the question of race supremacy\r\nupon this continent.\r\n\r\n\"Passing rapidly the minor incidents of the varying fortunes of\r\nthe stupendous struggle which had been transferred for the time\r\nfrom the Old World to the New, we reach the hour which was to mark\r\nan epoch in history.  The time, the thirteenth of September, 1759;\r\nthe place, the Heights of Abraham at Quebec.  There and then was\r\nfought out one of the pivotal battles of the ages.  It was the\r\nclosing act in a great drama.  The question to be determined:\r\nWhether the English-speaking race or its hereditary foe was to\r\nbe master of the continent.  It was in reality a struggle for empire\r\n--the magnificent domain stretching from the St. Lawrence to the\r\nGulf of Mexico.  The incidents of the battle need not now be told.\r\nNever were English or French soldiery led by more knightly captains.\r\nThe passing years have not dispelled the romance or dimmed the\r\nglory that gathered about the name of Wolfe and Montcalm.  Dying\r\nat the self-same moment--one amid the victors, the other amid the\r\nvanquished--their names live together in history.\r\n\r\n\"By the treaty of Paris which followed, France surrendered to\r\nher successful rival all claim to the domain east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver.  In accordance with the terms of the treaty, Gage, the\r\ncommander of the British forces in America, took formal possession\r\nof the recently conquered territory.  Proclamation of this fact\r\nwas made to the inhabitants of the Illinois country in 1764, and\r\na garrison soon thereafter established at Kaskaskia.  Here the rule\r\nof the British was for the time undisputed.  British domination in\r\nthe Mississippi Valley was, however, to be of short duration.  Soon\r\nthe events were hastening, the forces gathering, which were in turn\r\nto wrest from the crown no small part of the splendid domain won\r\nby Wolfe's brilliant victory at Quebec.\r\n\r\n\"In this hurried review I reach now an event of transcendent interest\r\nand one far-reaching in its consequences.  While our Revolutionary\r\nWar was in progress, and its glorious termination yet but dimly\r\nforeshadowed, General George Rogers Clark planned an expedition\r\nwhose successful termination has given his name to the list of\r\ngreat conquerors.  Bearing the commission of Patrick Henry, Governor\r\nof Virginia, the heroic Clark crossed the Ohio and began his\r\nperilous march.  After enduring untold hardships, the undaunted\r\nleader and his little band reached Kaskaskia.  The British commander\r\nand his garrison were surprised and quickly captured.  The British\r\nflag was lowered, and on the fourth day of July, 1778, the Illinois\r\ncountry was taken possession of in the name of the Commonwealth\r\nwhose Governor had authorized the expedition.\r\n\r\n\"Five years later occurred an event of mighty significance, and of\r\nfar-reaching consequence--one that in very truth marks the genesis\r\nof Illinois history.  I refer to the cession by Virginia of the\r\nvast area stretching to the Mississippi--of which the spot upon\r\nwhich we are now assembled is a part--to the general Government.\r\nTo the deed of cession, by which Illinois became a part of the\r\nUnited States, as commissioners upon the part of Virginia, were\r\nsigned the now historic names of Arthur Lee, James Monroe, and\r\nThomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\"The next milestone of Illinois upon the pathway to statehood\r\nwas what is so well known in our political history as the Ordinance\r\nof 1787.  Not inaptly has it been called 'the second Magna Charta,'\r\n'a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night,' in the settlement\r\nand government of the Northwestern States.  Two provisions of\r\nthe great ordinance possessed a value that cannot be measured by\r\nwords:  One, that the States to be formed out of said territory\r\nwere to remain forever parts of the United States of America;\r\nthe other, that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should\r\nexist therein, otherwise than for crime whereof the party should\r\nhave been duly convicted.\r\n\r\n\"The value of the great Ordinance to millions who have since found\r\nhomes within the limits of the vast area embraced within its\r\nprovision cannot be overstated.  Our eyes behold to-day the marvellous\r\nresults of the far-seeing statesmanship in which it was conceived.\r\n\r\n\"Momentous events now followed in rapid succession:  the disastrous\r\ndefeat of General St. Clair, first Governor of the Northwest\r\nTerritory, near the old Miami village; the appointment of General Wayne,\r\nhero of Stony Point, to the command of the Western army; his crushing\r\ndefeat of the Indian foe at the Maumee Rapids, and the treaty of\r\nGreenville, which for the time gave protection to the frontiersmen\r\nagainst the savage; the attempt of the French minister, Genet,\r\nto create discord in the western country, and in fact to establish\r\na Government in the Mississippi Valley, independent of that of the\r\nUnited States; and the threatened conflict with Spain regarding\r\nthe free navigation of the Mississippi--all possess an interest to\r\nIllinoisans which time cannot abate.\r\n\r\n\"All apprehension, however, was for the time removed by the treaty\r\nbetween our Government and Spain, by which it was provided that\r\nthe middle of the Mississippi should be our western border and that\r\nthe navigation of the entire river to the Gulf should be free to\r\nall the people of the United States.  Passing over the later\r\nfaithless attempt of Spain to abrogate this salient provision of\r\nthe treaty, it is enough that the question was forever put at rest\r\nby the purchase by our Government in 1803, for fifteen millions of\r\ndollars, from the great Napoleon, of the entire Louisiana country,\r\nstretching from the Gulf to the domain of Canada--out of which have\r\nbeen carved sixteen magnificent States, destined to abide and remain\r\nforever sovereign parts of our federal Union.\r\n\r\n\"And while Spain has sustained crushing and retributive defeat and\r\nher flag has disappeared forever from mainland and island of the\r\nwestern world, the great river, gathering its tributaries from\r\nnorthern lake to southern sea, flows unvexed through a mighty realm\r\nthat knows no symbol of authority save only our own Stars and\r\nStripes.\r\n\r\n\"Illinois was represented for the first time in a legislative\r\nchamber in the general assembly of the Northwest Territory,\r\nwhich convened in Cincinnati in 1799.  By act of Congress in\r\nMay, 1800, a new territorial organization was created, by which\r\nthe territory now embraced in the States of Indiana and Illinois\r\nwas formed, to be known as 'Indiana Territory,' and the capital\r\nlocated at Vincennes.  In February, 1809, by act of Congress,\r\nthe 'Territory of Illinois' was duly organized, its seat of government\r\nestablished at Kaskaskia.  Nine years later--December, 1818--with a\r\npopulation scarcely one-half that of McLean County to-day, it\r\nwas duly admitted a State of the federal Union.\r\n\r\n\"Beginning with Illinois at the coming of Joliet and Marquette\r\nin the seventeenth century, we have rapidly followed its thread of\r\nhistory for a century and a half, until it became a State of the\r\nAmerican Union.  We have seen it under the rule of the Frenchman, the\r\nBriton, the Virginian, under its various territorial organizations,\r\nuntil eighty-nine years ago it reached the dignity of statehood.\r\nWe have seen its seat of authority at Quebec, at New Orleans, at\r\nCincinnati, at Vincennes, and finally at Kaskaskia.  We have noted\r\nsomething of its marvellous development, of its wonderful increase\r\nin population.\r\n\r\n\"Just one hundred and seven years ago, when by act of Congress\r\nIllinois became part of the Indiana Territory, it contained a\r\npopulation of less than two thousand white persons, only eight\r\nhundred of whom were of the English-speaking race.  Less than\r\ntwo decades later, with a population of less then forty thousand, and\r\nan area greater, with a single exception, than any of the original\r\nStates, we have witnessed its admission to the Union.  How marvellous\r\nthe retrospect at this hour!  And yet, 'the pendulum of history\r\nswings in centuries in the slow but sure progress of the human race\r\nto a higher and nobler civilization.'\r\n\r\n\"Events of thrilling interest and of scarce less consequence\r\nthan those already mentioned followed the admission of the State\r\ninto the Union.  In brief summary:  The unsuccessful attempt to\r\nintroduce slavery; the fatal duel between Stewart and Bennet and\r\nthe trial and execution of the survivor for murder, thereby placing\r\nthe ban of judicial condemnation upon the barbarous practice;\r\nthe visit of Lafayette to Illinois and his brilliant entertainment\r\nby the Governor and Legislature at the old executive mansion;\r\nthe removal of the State capital from the ancient French village\r\nof Kaskaskia to Vandalia, and near two decades later to Springfield;\r\nthe memorable contest for Congress between Cook and McLean, each\r\npossessing in large measure the rare gift of eloquence, and both\r\ndying lamented in early manhood; the organization of two\r\nsplendid counties that will keep the honored names of Cook and\r\nMcLean in the memories of men to the latest posterity; the Black\r\nHawk War and the final treaty of peace which followed the defeat\r\nand capture of the renowned Sac chief; the riots at Alton and\r\nthe assassination of the heroic Lovejoy while defending the right of\r\nfree speech and of a free press; the advent of the prophet\r\nJoseph Smith, the rapid growth of the Mormon Church, its power as a\r\npolitical factor in the State, the building of the million-dollar temple\r\nat Nauvoo, the murder of the Mormon prophet, and the final exodus of\r\nhis adherents to the valley of the Wasatch and the Great Salt Lake;\r\nthe construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, the precursor\r\nof grander material achievements soon to follow; the bravery of\r\nthe Illinois troops during the war with Mexico; the wonderful tide\r\nof immigration flowing in from the older States and from Europe;\r\nthe invaluable services of Senator Douglas in securing the celebrated\r\nland grant under which the Illinois Central Railroad was\r\nconstructed, and Chicago brought into commercial touch with the\r\nRiver Ohio and the States to the southward; the dawn of the era of\r\nstupendous agricultural development, and of marvellous activity on\r\nall lines and through all channels of trade; the wonderful growth of\r\nChicago, springing with giant bound, within the span of a single\r\nlife, from a mere hamlet to be the second city upon the continent;\r\nthe unparalleled railroad construction, giving Illinois a\r\ngreater mileage than any one of her sister States; the immense\r\ndevelopment of its untold mineral resources, and the advance by\r\nleaps and bounds along all lines of manufacturing; the impetus\r\ngiven to the higher conception and purpose of human life by the\r\ncreation of a splendid system of public schools and universities; the\r\nestablishment of institutions and asylums for the considerate care\r\nand relief of the unfortunate and afflicted of our kind; the building\r\nof homes 'for him who hath borne the battle and for his orphan';\r\nthe masterful debates between Lincoln and Douglas, the prelude\r\nto events destined to give pause to the world, and to change the\r\ntrend of history.  And, to crown all, how, when the nation's life was\r\nin peril, Illinois, true to her covenant under the great Ordinance\r\nthat had given her being, gave one illustrious son to the chief\r\nmagistracy of his country, another to the captaincy of its armies,\r\nand sent her soldier heroes by myriads along every pathway of danger\r\nand of glory.\r\n\r\n\"As one standing, alas, 'upon the western slope,' let me adjure\r\nthe young men of this magnificent county--my home for more than\r\nhalf a century--to study thoroughly the history of our own State, and\r\nof the grand republic of which it is a part.  Illinois, in all that\r\nconstitutes true grandeur in a people, knows no superior among the\r\ngreat sisterhood of States.  Her pathway from the beginning has\r\nbeen luminous with noble achievement.  It is high privilege and high\r\nhonor to be a citizen of this grand republic.  It is in very truth\r\na government of the people, in an important sense a government\r\nstanding separate and apart; its foundations the morality, the\r\nintelligence, the patriotism of the people.  Never forget that\r\ncitizenship in such a government carries with it tremendous\r\nresponsibility, a responsibility that we cannot evade.  Study\r\nthoroughly how our liberties were achieved, and the benefits of\r\nstable government secured by the great compact which for more than\r\na century, in peace and during the storm and stress of war, has held\r\nStates and people in indissoluble union; and how, during the great\r\ncivil conflict--the most stupendous the world has known--human\r\nliberty, through baptism of blood, obtained a new and grander\r\nmeaning, and the Union established by our fathers was made, as\r\nwe humbly trust in God, enduring for all time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n[omitted]",
