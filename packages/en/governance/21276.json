The war of American Independence, 1775-1783, and the war of\r\n1812-1815 give their names to the book, not because of their military\r\nor naval importance, but because they mark, in each case, the outcome\r\nof successive years of unavailing efforts on the part of each country\r\nto avoid bloodshed.

The entire\r\nNorth American continent east of the Mississippi River was now under\r\nthe British flag, and four West India sugar islands were added to those\r\nalready in English hands.  In India, the rivalry of the French was\r\ndefinitely crushed and the control of the revenues and fortunes of the\r\nnative potentates was transferred to the East India Company.  Guided by\r\nthe genius of Pitt, British armies had beaten French in Germany and\r\nAmerica, and British fleets had conquered French and Spanish with\r\ncomplete ease.  The power of the Empire seemed beyond challenge.  Yet\r\nwithin this Empire itself there lay already the seeds of a discord\r\nwhich was soon {10} to develop into an irrepressible contest, leading\r\nto civil war; then, for a generation, to drive the separated parts into\r\nrenewed antagonism, and finally to cause a second war.  Between the\r\nNorth American colonies and the mother country there existed such\r\nmoral, political, and economic divergence that nothing but prudent and\r\npatient statesmanship on both sides of the Atlantic could prevent\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental source of antagonism lay in the fact that the thirteen\r\ncolonies had developed a wholly different social and political life\r\nfrom that of the mother country.  Originally, the prevailing ideas and\r\nhabits of the colonists and of the Englishmen who remained at home had\r\nbeen substantially the same.  In England, as in America, the gentry and\r\nmiddle classes played a leading part during the years from 1600 to\r\n1660.  But by 1763 England, under the Hanoverian kings, had become a\r\nstate where all political and social power had been gathered into the\r\nhands of a landed aristocracy which dominated the government, the\r\nChurch, and the professions.  In parliament, the House of Commons--once\r\nthe body which reflected the conscious strength of the gentry and\r\ncitizens,--had now fallen under the control of the peers, owing to the\r\ndecayed condition of scores of ancient parliamentary boroughs.  Nearly\r\none-third of the seats were actually {11} or substantially owned by\r\nnoblemen, and of the remainder a majority were venal, the close\r\ncorporations of Mayor and Aldermen selling freely their right to return\r\ntwo members at each parliamentary election.  In addition, the influence\r\nand prestige of the great landowners were so powerful that even in the\r\ncounties, and in those boroughs where the number of electors was\r\nconsiderable, none but members of the ruling class sought election.  So\r\nfar as the members of the middle class were concerned--the merchants,\r\nmaster weavers, iron producers, and craftsmen,--they were strong in\r\nwealth and their wishes counted heavily with the aristocracy in all\r\nlegislation of a financial or commercial nature; but of actual part in\r\nthe government they had none.  As for the lower classes,--the\r\nlabourers, tenant farmers, and shopkeepers,--they were able as a rule\r\nto influence government only by rioting and uproar.  Without the\r\nballot, they had no other way.\r\n\r\nOwing to the personal weakness of successive monarchs since the death\r\nof William III, there had grown up the cabinet system of government\r\nwhich, in 1763, meant the reduction of the King to the position of an\r\nhonorary figurehead and the actual control of officers, perquisites,\r\npatronage, and preferment, as well as the direction of public policy,\r\nby the leaders of parliamentary groups.  The King was {12} obliged to\r\nselect his ministers from among the members of noble families in the\r\nLords or Commons, who agreed among themselves after elaborate bargains\r\nand negotiations upon the formation of cabinets and the distribution of\r\nhonours.  In this way sundry great Whig family \"connections,\" as they\r\nwere called, had come to monopolize political power, excluding Tories,\r\nor adherents of the Stuarts, and treating government as solely a matter\r\nof aristocratic concern.  Into this limited circle, a poor man could\r\nrise only by making himself useful through his talents or his eloquence\r\nto one of the ruling cliques, and the goal of his career was naturally\r\na peerage.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this system of government by family connection lay in\r\nits thorough dependence upon customs of patronage and perquisite.  The\r\npublic offices were heavily burdened with lucrative sinecures, which\r\nwere used in the factional contests to buy support in Parliament, as\r\nwere also peerages, contracts, and money bribes.  When George III\r\nascended the throne, in 1760, he found the most powerful Minister in\r\nthe Cabinet to be the Duke of Newcastle, whose sole qualification,\r\napart from his birth, was his pre-eminent ability to handle patronage\r\nand purchase votes.  That such a system did not ruin England was due to\r\nthe tenacity and personal courage of this aristocracy and to {13} its\r\nuse of parliamentary methods, whereby the orderly conduct of\r\nlegislation and taxation and the habit of public attack and defence of\r\ngovernment measures furnished political training for the whole ruling\r\nclass.  Further, the absence of any sharp caste lines made it possible\r\nfor them to turn, in times of crisis, to such strong-fibred and\r\nmasterful commoners as Walpole and Pitt, each of whom, in his way,\r\nsaved the country from the incompetent hands of titled ministries.\r\n\r\nThis system, moreover, rested in 1763 on the aquiescence of practically\r\nall Englishmen.  It was accepted by middle and lower classes alike as\r\nnormal and admirable; and only a small body of radicals felt called\r\nupon to criticize the exclusion of the mass of taxpayers from a share\r\nin the government.  Pitt, in Parliament, was ready to proclaim a\r\nnational will as something distinct from the voice of the\r\nborough-owners, but he had few followers.  Only in London and a few\r\ncounties did sundry advocates of parliamentary reform strive in the\r\nyears after 1763 to emphasize these views by organizing the freemen to\r\npetition and to \"instruct\" their representatives in the Commons.  Such\r\ndesires evoked nothing but contempt and antipathy in the great majority\r\nof Englishmen.  Especially when they became audible in the mouths of\r\nrioters did they appear revolutionary and {14} obnoxious to the lovers\r\nof peace, good order, and the undisturbed collection of rents and\r\ntaxes.  Nothing but a genuine social revolution could bring such ideas\r\nto victory and that, in 1763, lay very far in the future.  For the time\r\nconservatism reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteen colonies, on the other hand, the communities of\r\nmiddle-class Englishmen who emigrated in the seventeenth century had\r\ndeveloped nothing resembling a real aristocracy.  Social distinctions,\r\nmodelled on those of the old country, remained between the men of large\r\nwealth--such as the great landed proprietors in New York and the\r\nplanters in the South, or the successful merchants in New England and\r\nthe Middle colonies--and the small farmers, shopkeepers, and fishermen,\r\nwho formed the bulk of the population; while all of these joined in\r\nregarding the outlying frontiersmen as elements of society deserving of\r\nsmall consideration.  Men of property, education, and \"position\"\r\nexercised a distinct leadership in public and private life.  Yet all\r\nthis remained purely social; in law no such thing as an aristocracy\r\ncould be found, and in government the colonies had grown to be very\r\nnearly republican.  Here lay the fundamental distinction between the\r\nEngland and the America of 1763.  In America, a title or peerage\r\nconferred no political rights {15} whatever; these were founded in\r\nevery case on law, on a royal charter or a royal commission which\r\nestablished a frame of government, and were based on moderate property\r\nqualifications which admitted a majority of adult males to the suffrage\r\nand to office.\r\n\r\nIn every colony the government consisted of a governor, a council, and\r\nan assembly representing the freemen.  This body, by charter, or royal\r\ninstructions, had the full right to impose taxes and vote laws; and,\r\nalthough its acts were liable to veto by the governor, or by the Crown\r\nthrough the Privy Council, it possessed the actual control of political\r\npower.  This it derived immediately from its constituents and not from\r\nany patrons, lords, or close corporations.  Representation and the\r\npopular will were, in fact, indissolubly united.\r\n\r\nThe governor in two colonies, Connecticut and Rhode Island, was chosen\r\nby the freemen.  Elsewhere, he was appointed by an outside authority:\r\nin Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland by the hereditary proprietor to\r\nwhom the charter had been granted, in all other colonies by the Crown.\r\nThe councillors, who commonly exercised judicial functions in addition\r\nto their duties as the governor's advisers and as the upper house of\r\nthe legislature, were appointed in all colonies except the three in New\r\nEngland; {16} and they were chosen in all cases from among the socially\r\nprominent colonists.  The judges, also, were appointed by the governor;\r\nand they, with governor and council, were supposed to represent the\r\nhome government in the colonies.\r\n\r\nBut in reality there was no effective imperial control.  The Crown, it\r\nis true, appeared to have large powers.  It granted charters,\r\nestablished provinces by commissions, exercised the right to annul laws\r\nand hear appeals from colonial decisions, exacted reports from\r\ngovernors, sent instructions, and made appointments and removals at\r\nwill.  But nearly all the colonial officials, except the few customs\r\nofficers, were paid out of colonial appropriations, and this one fact\r\nsufficed to deprive them of any independent position.  In nearly every\r\ncolony, the assembly, in the course of two-thirds of a century of\r\nincessant petty conflict, of incessant wrangling and bargaining, of\r\nincessant encroachments on the nominal legal powers of the governor,\r\nhad made itself master of the administration.  The colonists resisted\r\nall attempts to direct their military or civil policy, laid only such\r\ntaxes as they chose, raised only such troops as they saw fit, passed\r\nonly such laws as seemed to them desirable, and tied the governor's\r\nhands by every sort of device.  They usurped the {17} appointment of\r\nthe colonial treasurer, they appointed committees to oversee the\r\nexpenditure of sums voted, they systematically withheld a salary from\r\nthe governor, in order to render him dependent upon annual \"presents,\"\r\nliable to diminution or termination in case he did not satisfy the\r\nassembly's wishes.  The history of the years from 1689 to 1763 is a\r\nchronicle of continual defeat for governors who were obliged to see one\r\npower after another wrenched away from them.  Under the circumstances,\r\nthe political life of the thirteen colonies was practically republican\r\nin character, and was as marked for its absence of administrative\r\nmachinery as the home government was for its aristocracy and\r\ncentralization.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of colonial life tended to accentuate this difference.\r\nAlthough religion had ceased to be a political question, and the\r\nEnglish Church was no longer regarded, save in New England, as\r\ndangerous to liberty, the fact that the great majority of the colonists\r\nwere dissenters--Congregational, Presbyterian, or Reformed, with a\r\nconsiderable scattering of Baptists and other sects--had an effect on\r\nthe attitude of the people toward England.  In the home country, the\r\ncontrolling social classes accepted the established church as part of\r\nthe constitution; but in the colonies it had small {18} strength, and\r\neven where it was by law established it remained little more than an\r\nofficial body, the \"Governor's church.\"  This tended to widen the gap\r\nbetween the political views of the individualistic dissenting and\r\nPuritan sects in the colonies and the people at home.\r\n\r\nThe American of 1763 was thus a different kind of man from the\r\nEnglishman.  As a result of the divergent development on the two sides\r\nof the Atlantic from a common ancestry, their political habits had\r\nbecome mutually incomprehensible.  To the Englishman, the rule of the\r\nnobility was normal--the ideal political system.  He was content, if a\r\ncommoner, with the place assigned to him.  To the colonist, on the\r\nother hand, government in which the majority of adult male inhabitants\r\npossessed the chief power was the only valid form,--all others were\r\nvicious.  Patriotism meant two contradictory things.  The Englishman's\r\npatriotism was sturdy but unenthusiastic, and showed itself almost as\r\nmuch in a contempt for foreigners as in complacency over English\r\ninstitutions.  The colonist, on the contrary, had a double allegiance:\r\none conventional and traditional, to the British crown; the other a\r\nnew, intensely local and narrow attachment to his province.  England\r\nwas still the \"old home,\" looked to as the source of political\r\nauthority, of manners and literature.  It was for many of {19} the\r\nresidents their recent abode and, for all except a few of Dutch,\r\nGerman, or French extraction, their ancestral country.  But already\r\nthis \"loyalty\" on the part of the colonists was dwindling into\r\nsomething more sentimental than real.  The genuine local patriotism of\r\nthe colonists was shown by their persistent struggle against the\r\nrepresentatives of English authority in the governors' chairs.  There\r\nhad developed in America a new sort of man, an \"American,\" who wished\r\nto be as independent of government as possible, and who, while\r\nprofessing and no doubt feeling a general loyalty to England, was in\r\nfact a patriot of his own colony.\r\n\r\nThe colonists entered very slightly into the thoughts of the English\r\nnoblemen and gentry.  They were regarded in a highly practical way,\r\nwithout a trace of any sentiment, as members of the middle and lower\r\nclasses, not without a large criminal admixture, who had been helped\r\nand allowed to build up some unruly and not very admirable communities.\r\nNor did the English middle classes look upon the colonists with much\r\ninterest, or regard them as, on the whole, their equals.  The\r\nprevailing colonial political habits, as seen from England, suggested\r\nonly unwarrantable wrangling indicative of political incompetence and a\r\nspirit of disobedience.  Loyalty, to an {20} Englishman, meant\r\nsubmission to the law.  To men trained in such different schools, words\r\ndid not mean the same thing.  The time had come when the two peoples\r\nwere scarcely able to understand each other.\r\n\r\nA second cause for antagonism, scarcely less fundamental and destined\r\nto cause equal irritation, is to be found in the conflict between the\r\neconomic life of the American communities and the beliefs of the mother\r\ncountry concerning commercial and naval policy.  Great Britain, in\r\n1763, was predominantly a trading country.  Its ships carried goods for\r\nall the nations of Europe and brought imports to England from all\r\nlands.  Although the manufacturers were not yet in possession of the\r\nnew inventions which were to revolutionize the industries of the world,\r\nthey were active and prosperous in their domestic production of\r\nhardware and textiles, and they furnished cargoes for the shipowners to\r\ntransport to all quarters.  To these two great interests of the middle\r\nclasses, banking and finance were largely subsidiary.  Agriculture, the\r\nmainstay of the nobility and gentry, continued to hold first place in\r\nthe interests of the governing classes, but the importance of all\r\nsources of wealth was fully recognized.\r\n\r\nIn the colonies, on the contrary, manufacture scarcely existed beyond\r\nthe domestic {21} production of articles for local use; and the\r\ninhabitants relied on importations for nearly all finished commodities\r\nand for all luxuries.  Their products were chiefly things which Great\r\nBritain could not itself raise, such as sugar in the West Indies;\r\ntobacco from the islands and the southern mainland colonies; indigo and\r\nrice from Carolina; furs, skins, masts, pine products; and, from New\r\nEngland, above all, fish.  The natural market for these articles was in\r\nEngland or in other colonies; and in return British manufactures found\r\ntheir natural market in the new communities.  When the Economic\r\nRevolution transformed industry, and factories, driven by steam, made\r\nEngland the workshop of the world, the existing tendency for her to\r\nsupply America with manufactured products was intensified regardless of\r\nthe political separation of the two countries.  Not until later\r\neconomic changes supervened was this normal relationship altered.\r\n\r\nThe traditional British policy in 1763 was that of the so-called\r\nMercantile System, which involved a thoroughgoing application of the\r\nprinciple of protection to the British shipowner, manufacturer, and\r\ncorn-grower against any competition.  An elaborate tariff, with a\r\nsystem of prohibitions and bounties, attempted to prevent the landowner\r\nfrom being undersold by foreign corn, and the {22} manufacturer from\r\nmeeting competition from foreign producers.  Navigation Acts shut out\r\nforeign-built, -owned, or -manned ships from the carrying trade between\r\nany region but their home country and England, reserving all other\r\ncommerce for British vessels.  Into this last restriction there entered\r\nanother purely political consideration, namely, the perpetuation of a\r\nsupply of mariners for the British navy, whose importance was fully\r\nrecognized.  So far as the colonies were concerned, they were brought\r\nwithin the scope of mercantilist ideas by being considered as sources\r\nof supply for England in products not possible to raise at home, as\r\nmarkets which must be reserved for British manufacturers and traders,\r\nand as places which must not be allowed to develop any rivalry to\r\nBritish producers.  Furthermore, they were so situated that by proper\r\nregulations they might serve to encourage British shipping even if this\r\ninvolved an economic loss.\r\n\r\nThe Navigation Acts accordingly, from 1660 to 1763, were designed to\r\nput this theory into operation, and excluded all foreign vessels from\r\ntrading with the colonies, prohibited any trade to the colonies except\r\nfrom British ports and enumerated certain commodities--sugar, cotton,\r\ndye woods, indigo, rice, furs--which could be sent only to England.  To\r\nensure the carrying out of these {23} laws, an elaborate system of\r\nbonds and local duties was devised, and customs officers were\r\nappointed, resident in the colonies, while governors were obliged to\r\ntake oath to enforce the Acts.  As time revealed defects or unnecessary\r\nstringencies, the restrictions were frequently modified.  The\r\nCarolinas, for instance, were allowed to ship rice not only to England,\r\nbut to any place in Europe south of Cape Finisterre.  Bounties were\r\nestablished to aid the production of tar and turpentine; but special\r\nActs prohibited the export of hats from the colonies, or the\r\nmanufacture of rolled iron, in order to check a possible source of\r\ncompetition to British producers.  In short, the Board of Trade, the\r\nadministrative body charged with the oversight of the plantations,\r\ndevoted its energies to suggesting devices which should aid the\r\ncolonists, benefit the British consumer and producer, and increase\r\n\"navigation.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the Acts of Trade were, in general, a source of\r\nloss to the colonies.  Their vessels shared in the privileges reserved\r\nfor British-built ships.  The compulsory sending of the enumerated\r\ncommodities to England may have damaged the tobacco-growers; but in\r\nother respects it did little harm.  The articles would have gone to\r\nEngland in any case.  The restriction of importation to goods from\r\nEngland was no {24} great grievance, since British products would, in\r\nany case, have supplied the American market.  Even the effort, by an\r\nAct of 1672, to check intercolonial trade in enumerated commodities was\r\nnot oppressive, for, with one exception noted below, there was no great\r\ndevelopment of such a trade.  By 1763, according to the best evidence,\r\nthe thirteen colonies seem to have adjusted their habits to the\r\nNavigation Acts, and to have been carrying on their flourishing\r\ncommerce within these restrictions.\r\n\r\nTo this general condition, however, there were some slight exceptions,\r\nand one serious one.  The colonists undoubtedly resented the necessity\r\nof purchasing European products from English middlemen, and were\r\nespecially desirous of importing Spanish and Portuguese wines and\r\nFrench brandies directly.  Smuggling in these articles seems to have\r\nbeen steadily carried on.  Much more important--and to the American\r\nship-owners the kernel of the whole matter--was the problem of the West\r\nIndia trade.  It was proved, as the eighteenth century progressed, that\r\nthe North American colonies could balance their heavy indebtedness to\r\nthe mother country for excess of imports over exports only by selling\r\nto the French, as well as the British West Indies, barrel staves,\r\nclapboards, fish and food products.  In {25} return, they took sugar\r\nand molasses, developing in New England a flourishing rum manufacture,\r\nwhich in turn was used in the African slave trade.  By these means the\r\npeople of the New England and Middle colonies built up an active\r\ncommerce, using their profits to balance their indebtedness to England.\r\nThis \"triangular trade\" disturbed the British West India planters, who,\r\nbeing largely non-residents and very influential in London, induced\r\nParliament, in 1733, to pass an Act imposing prohibitory duties on all\r\nsugar and molasses of foreign growth.  This law, if enforced, would\r\nhave struck a damaging blow at the prosperity of the Northern colonies,\r\nmerely to benefit the West India sugar-growers by giving them a\r\nmonopoly; but the evidence goes to show that it was systematically\r\nevaded and that French sugar, together with French and Portuguese\r\nwines, was still habitually smuggled into the colonies.  Thus the\r\nNavigation Acts, in the only points where they would have been actually\r\noppressive, were not enforced.  The colonial governors saw the serious\r\nconsequences and shrank from arousing discontent.  It is significant\r\nthat the same colonists who contended with the royal governors did not\r\nhesitate to violate a parliamentary law when it ran counter to their\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe only reason why the radical difference {26} between the colonies\r\nand the home government did not cause open conflict long before 1763 is\r\nto be found in the absorption of the English ministries in\r\nparliamentary manoeuvring at home, diplomacy, and European wars.  The\r\nweakness of the imperial control was recognized and frequently\r\ncomplained of by governors, Boards of Trade, and other officials; but\r\nso long as the colonies continued to supply the sugar, furs, lumber and\r\nmasts called for by the Acts, bought largely from English shippers and\r\nmanufacturers, and stimulated the growth of British shipping, the Whig\r\nand Tory noblemen were content.  The rapidly growing republicanism of\r\nthe provincial and proprietary governments was ignored and allowed to\r\ndevelop unchecked.  A half-century of complaints from thwarted\r\ngovernors, teeming with suggestions that England ought to take the\r\ngovernment of the colonies into its own hands, produced no results\r\nbeyond creating in official circles an opinion unfavourable to the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nIn the years of the French war, 1754-1760, the utter incompatibility\r\nbetween imperial theories on the one hand and colonial political habits\r\non the other, could no longer be disregarded.  In the midst of the\r\nstruggle, the legislatures continued to wrangle with governors over\r\npoints of privilege; they were slow to vote supplies; they were {27}\r\ndilatory in raising troops; they hung back from a jealous fear that\r\ntheir neighbour colonies might fail to do their share; they were ready\r\nto let British soldiers do all the hard fighting.  Worse still, the\r\ncolonial shipowners persisted in their trade with the French and\r\nSpanish West Indies, furnishing their enemies with supplies, and buying\r\ntheir sugar and molasses as usual.  When, in Boston, writs of\r\nassistance were employed by the customs officials, in order that by a\r\ngeneral power of search they might discover such smuggled property, the\r\nmerchants protested in the courts, and James Otis, a fiery young\r\nlawyer, boldly declared the writs an infringement of the rights of the\r\ncolonists, unconstitutional, and beyond the power of Parliament to\r\nauthorize.  To Ministers engaged in a tremendous war for the overthrow\r\nof France, the behaviour of the colonies revealed a spirit scarcely\r\nshort of disloyalty, and a weakness of government no longer to be\r\ntolerated.  The Secretaries, the Board of Trade, the customs officials,\r\narmy officers, naval commanders, colonial governors, and judges all\r\nagreed that the time had come for a thorough and drastic reform.  They\r\napproached the task purely and simply as members of the English\r\ngoverning classes, ignorant of the colonists' political ideas and\r\ntotally indifferent to their views; and their measures were framed in\r\nthe spirit {28} of unquestioning acceptance of the principles of the\r\nActs of Trade as a fundamental national policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CONTEST OVER PARLIAMENTARY TAXATION, 1763-1773\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister responsible for the new colonial policy was George\r\nGrenville, who assumed his position in May, 1763, shortly after the\r\nfinal treaty of Paris.  Every other member of his Cabinet was a\r\nnobleman, Grenville himself was brother of an earl, and most of them\r\nhad had places in preceding Ministries.  It was a typical\r\nadministration of the period, completely aristocratic in membership and\r\nspirit, quite indifferent to colonial views, and incapable of\r\ncomprehending colonial ideals even if they had known them.  To them the\r\nbusiness in hand was a purely practical one; and with confident energy\r\nGrenville pushed through a series of measures, which had been carefully\r\nworked out, of course, by minor officials unknown to fame, during the\r\npreceding months, {29} but which were destined to produce results\r\nundreamed of by any one in England.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there were a number of measures to strengthen and\r\nrevivify the Acts of Trade.  Colonists were given new privileges in the\r\nwhale fishery, hides and skins were \"enumerated,\" and steps were taken\r\nto secure a more rigorous execution of the Acts by the employment of\r\nnaval vessels against smuggling.  A new Sugar Act reduced the tariff on\r\nforeign sugar to such a point that it would be heavily protective\r\nwithout being prohibitive, and at the same time imposed special duties\r\non Portuguese wines, while providing additional machinery for\r\ncollecting customs.  This was clearly aimed at the weak point in the\r\nexisting navigation system; but it introduced a new feature, for the\r\nsugar duties, unlike previous ones, were intended to raise a revenue,\r\nand this, it was provided in the Act, should be used to pay for the\r\ndefence of America.\r\n\r\nA second new policy was inaugurated in a proclamation of October, 1763,\r\nwhich made Florida and Canada despotically governed provinces, and set\r\noff all the land west of the head-waters of the rivers running into the\r\nAtlantic as an Indian reservation.  No further land grants were to be\r\nmade in that region, nor was any trade to be permitted with the Indians\r\nsave by royal licence.  The {30} Imperial government thus assumed\r\ncontrol of Indian policy, and endeavoured to check any further growth\r\nof the existing communities to the West.  Such a scheme necessitated\r\nthe creation of a royal standing army in America on a larger scale than\r\nthe previous garrisons; and this plan led to the third branch of the\r\nnew policy, which contemplated the positive interposition of Parliament\r\nto remedy the shortcomings of colonial assemblies.  An Act of 1764\r\nprohibited the future issue of any paper money by any colony, thus\r\nterminating one of the chief grievances of British governors and\r\nmerchants.  But still more striking was an Act of 1765, which provided\r\nwith great elaboration for the collection of a stamp tax in the\r\ncolonies upon all legal documents, newspapers, and pamphlets.  The\r\nproceeds were to be used to pay about one-third of the cost of the new\r\nstanding army, which was to consist of ten thousand men.  Taken in\r\nconnection with the announced intention of using the revenue from the\r\nSugar Act for the same purpose, it is obvious that Grenville's measures\r\nwere meant to relieve the Imperial government from the necessity of\r\ndepending in future upon the erratic and unmanageable colonial\r\nlegislatures.  They were parts of a general political and financial\r\nprogramme.  There is not the slightest evidence that Grenville or his\r\nassociates dreamed {31} that they were in any way affecting the\r\ncolonists' rights or restricting their liberties.  Grenville did\r\nconsult the colonial agents--individuals authorized to represent the\r\ncolonial assemblies in England--but simply with a view to meeting\r\npractical objections.  The various proclamations or orders were issued\r\nwithout opposition, and the bills passed Parliament almost unnoticed.\r\nThe British governing class was but slightly concerned with colonial\r\nreform: the Board of Trade, the colonial officials, and the responsible\r\nMinisters were the only people interested.\r\n\r\nTo the astonishment of the Cabinet and of the English public, the new\r\nmeasures, especially the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act, raised a storm of\r\nopposition in the colonies unlike anything in their history.  The\r\nreasons are obvious.  If the new Sugar Act was to be enforced, it meant\r\nthe end of the flourishing French West India intercourse and the death\r\nof the \"triangular\" trade.  Every distiller, shipowner, and exporter of\r\nfish, timber, or grain, felt himself threatened with ruin.  If the\r\nStamp Act were enforced, it meant the collection of a tax from\r\ncommunities already in debt from the French wars, which were in future\r\nto be denied the facile escape from heavy taxes hitherto afforded by\r\nbills of credit.  But the economic burdens threatened were almost lost\r\nsight of in the political {32} dangers.  If England meant to impose\r\ntaxes by parliamentary vote for military purposes, instead of calling\r\nupon the colonists to furnish money and men, it meant a deadly blow to\r\nthe importance of the assemblies.  They could no longer exercise\r\ncomplete control over their property and their finances.  They would\r\nsink to the status of mere municipal bodies.  So far as the Americans\r\nof 1765 were concerned, the feeling was universal that such a change\r\nwas intolerable, that if they ceased to have the full power to give or\r\nwithhold taxes at their discretion they were practically slaves.\r\n\r\nIn every colony there sprang to the front leaders who voiced these\r\nsentiments in impassioned speeches and pamphlets; for the most part\r\nyoung men, many of them lawyers accustomed to look for popular approval\r\nin resisting royal governors.  Such men as James Otis and Samuel Adams\r\nin Massachusetts, William Livingston in New York, Patrick Henry in\r\nVirginia, Christopher Gadsden in South Carolina denounced the Stamp Act\r\nas tyrannous, unconstitutional, and an infringement of the liberties of\r\nthe colonists.  Popular anger rose steadily until, in the autumn, when\r\nthe stamps arrived, the people of the thirteen colonies had nerved\r\nthemselves to the pitch of refusing to obey the Act.  Under pressure\r\nfrom crowds of angry men, {33} every distributor was compelled to\r\nresign, the stamps were in some cases destroyed, and in Boston the\r\nhouses of unpopular officials were mobbed and sacked.  Before the\r\nexcitement, the governors stood utterly helpless.  They could do\r\nnothing to carry out the Act.\r\n\r\nIn October, delegates representing nearly all the colonies met at New\r\nYork, and drafted resolutions expressing their firm belief that no tax\r\ncould legally be levied upon them but by their own consent, given\r\nthrough their legislatures.  It was the right of Englishmen not to be\r\ntaxed without their consent.  Petitions in respectful but determined\r\nlanguage were sent to the King and to Parliament, praying for the\r\nrepeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.  For the first time in their\r\nhistory, the colonies stood together in full harmony to denounce and\r\nreject an Act passed by Parliament.  As a social and political fact,\r\nthis unanimous demonstration of colonial feeling was of profound\r\nsignificance.  The ease and ability with which the lawyers, planters,\r\nfarmers, or merchants directed the popular excitement into effective\r\nchannels showed the widespread political education of the Americans.  A\r\nnot dissimilar excitement in London in the same years found no other\r\nmeans of expressing itself than bloody rioting.  It was American {34}\r\nrepublicanism showing its strongest aspect in political resistance.\r\n\r\nThe issue thus presented to the British government was one demanding\r\nthe most careful consideration and far-seeing wisdom in its treatment.\r\nGrenville's measures, however admirable and reasonable in themselves,\r\nhad stirred the bitter opposition of all the colonists, and the\r\nenforcement or modification of them called for steadiness and courage.\r\nWere the English governing noblemen of the day ready to persist in the\r\nnew policy?  If so, it meant violent controversy and possibly colonial\r\ninsurrection; but the exertion of British authority, if coupled with\r\nstrong naval pressure, ought to prevail.  Angry as the colonists were,\r\ntheir language indicates that revolution was not in their thoughts;\r\nand, if there was one quality beyond all others in which the British\r\naristocracy excelled, it was an inflexible tenacity when once a policy\r\nwas definitely embraced.  Unfortunately for both sides, the clear-cut\r\nissue thus raised was obscured and distorted by the presence on the\r\nthrone of an ambitious young prince with a policy which threw British\r\ndomestic affairs into unexampled confusion.\r\n\r\nGeorge III, obstinate, narrow-minded, and determined to make his own\r\nwill felt in the choice of Ministers and the direction of affairs, had\r\nsucceeded his grandfather in 1760.  Too {35} astute to violate the\r\nfast-bound tradition of the British constitution that he must govern\r\nonly through Ministers, he saw that to have his own way he must secure\r\npolitical servants who, while acting as Cabinet Ministers, should take\r\ntheir orders from him.  He also saw that to destroy the hold of the\r\nWhig family cliques he must enter politics himself and buy, intimidate,\r\nand cajole in order to win a following for his Ministers in parliament.\r\nWith this ideal in view, he subordinated all other considerations to\r\nthe single one of getting subservient Ministers, and fought or\r\nintrigued against any Cabinet which did not accept his direction,\r\nuntil, in 1770, he finally triumphed.  In the meantime he had kept\r\nEngland under a fluctuating succession of Ministries which forbade the\r\nmaintenance of any coherent or authoritative colonial policy such as\r\nalone could have prevented disaster.\r\n\r\nIn 1761 George III tried to induce Parliament to accept the leadership\r\nof the Earl of Bute, his former tutor, who had never held public\r\noffice; but his rapid rise to the Premiership aroused such jealousy\r\namong the nobility and such unpopularity among the people that the\r\nunfortunate Scot quailed before the storm of ridicule and abuse.  He\r\nresigned in 1763, and was succeeded by Grenville, who instantly showed\r\nGeorge III that he would take no dictation.  On the contrary, {36} he\r\ndrove the King to the point of fury by his masterfulness.  In\r\ndesperation, George then turned to the Marquis of Rockingham who, if\r\nequally determined to decline royal dictation, was personally less\r\noffensive to him; and there came in a Ministry of the usual type, all\r\nnoblemen but two minor members, and all belonging to \"connections\"\r\ndifferent from those of the Grenville Ministry.  Thus it was that, when\r\nthe unanimous defiance of the Americans reached England, the Ministers\r\nresponsible for the colonial reforms were out of office, and the\r\nRockingham Whigs had assumed control, feeling no obligation to continue\r\nanything begun by their predecessors.  George III's interposition was\r\nresponsible for this situation.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met in January, 1766, the colonists received powerful\r\nallies, first in the British merchants, who petitioned against the Act\r\nas causing the practical stoppage of American purchases, and second in\r\nWilliam Pitt, who, in a burning speech, embraced in full the colonists'\r\nposition, and declared that a parliamentary tax upon the plantations\r\nwas absolutely contrary to the rights of Englishmen.  He \"rejoiced that\r\nAmerica has resisted.\"  This radical position found few followers; but\r\nthe Whig Ministry, after some hesitation, decided to grant the colonial\r\ndemands while insisting {37} on the imperial rights of Parliament.\r\nThis characteristically English action was highly distasteful to the\r\nmajority in the House of Lords, who voted to execute the law, and to\r\nGeorge III, who disliked to yield to mutinous subjects; but they were\r\nforced to give way.  The Stamp Act was repealed, and the sugar duties\r\nwere reduced to a low figure.  At the same time a Declaratory Act was\r\npassed, asserting that Parliament had full power to bind the colonies\r\n\"in all cases whatsoever.\"  Thus the Americans had their way in part,\r\nwhile submitting to seeing their arguments rejected.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this unfortunate affair were to bring into sharp\r\ncontrast the British and the American views of the status of the\r\ncolonies.  The former considered them as parts of the realm, subject\r\nlike any other part to the legislative authority of King, Lords, and\r\nCommons.  The contention of the colonists, arising naturally from the\r\ntrue situation in each colonial government, that the rights of\r\nEnglishmen guaranteed their freedom from taxation without\r\nrepresentation, was answered by the perfectly sound legal assertion\r\nthat the colonists, like all the people of England, were \"virtually\"\r\nrepresented in the House of Commons.  The words, in short, meant one\r\nthing in England, another thing in America.  English speakers {38} and\r\nwriters pointed to the scores of statutes affecting the colonies,\r\ncalling attention especially to the export duties of the Navigation Act\r\nof 1672, and the import duties of the Act of 1733, not to mention its\r\nrevision of 1764.  Further, Parliament had regulated provincial coinage\r\nand money, had set up a postal service, and established rates.\r\nAlthough Parliament had not imposed any such tax as the Stamp Act, it\r\nhad, so far as precedent showed, exercised financial powers on many\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nTo meet the British appeal to history, the colonists developed the\r\ntheory that commercial regulation, including the imposition of customs\r\nduties, was \"external\" and hence lay naturally within the scope of\r\nimperial legislation, but that \"internal\" taxation was necessarily in\r\nthe hands of the colonial assemblies.  There was sufficient\r\nplausibility in this claim to commend it to Pitt, who adopted it in his\r\nspeeches, and to Benjamin Franklin, the agent for Pennsylvania, already\r\nwell known as a \"philosopher,\" who expounded it confidently when he was\r\nexamined as an expert on American affairs at the bar of the Commons.\r\nIt was, however, without any clear legal justification, and, as English\r\nspeakers kept pointing out, it was wholly incompatible with the\r\nexistence of a genuine imperial government.  That it was {39} a\r\nperfectly practical distinction, in keeping with English customs, was\r\nalso true; but that was not to be realized until three-quarters of a\r\ncentury later.\r\n\r\nWith the repeal of the objectionable law the uproar in America ceased,\r\nand, amid profuse expressions of gratitude to Pitt, the Ministry, and\r\nthe King, the colonists returned to their normal activities.  The other\r\nparts of the Grenville programme were not altered, and it was now\r\npossible for English Ministers, by a wise and steady policy, to improve\r\nthe weak spots in the colonial system without giving undue offence to a\r\npopulation whose sensitiveness and obstinate devotion to entire\r\nself-government had been so powerfully shown.  Unfortunately, the King\r\nagain interposed his influence in such wise as to prevent any rational\r\ncolonial policy.  In the summer of 1766, tiring of the Rockingham\r\nMinistry, he managed to bring together an odd coalition of political\r\ngroups under the nominal headship of the Duke of Grafton.  Pitt, who\r\ndisliked the family cliques, accepted office and the title of Earl of\r\nChatham, hoping to lead a national Ministry.  The other elements were\r\nin part Whig, and in part representatives of the so-called \"King's\r\nFriends\"--a growing body of more or less venal politicians who clung to\r\nGeorge's support for the sake of the patronage to be {40} gained--and\r\nseveral genuine Tories who looked to a revived royal power to end the\r\nWhig monopoly.  From such a Cabinet no consistent policy was to be\r\nexpected, save under leadership of a man like Pitt.  Unfortunately the\r\nlatter was immediately taken with an illness which kept him out of\r\npublic life for two years; and Grafton, the nominal Prime Minister, was\r\nutterly unable to hold his own against the influence and intrigues of\r\nthe King.  From the start, accordingly, the Ministry proved weak and\r\nunstable, and it allowed a new set of colonial quarrels to develop.\r\n\r\nCharles Townshend, Chancellor of the Exchequer, one of the originators\r\nof the new colonial policy under the Bute Ministry, was so ill-advised\r\nas to renew the attempt to raise a colonial revenue by parliamentary\r\ntaxation.  His manner of proposing the measure gave the impression that\r\nit was a piece of sheer bravado on his part, intended to regain the\r\nprestige which he had lost by failing to carry all of his first budget;\r\nbut the nature of the scheme indicates its close connection with the\r\nGrenville ideals.  Avoiding the appearance of a direct internal tax, he\r\ncaused the imposition of duties on glass, painters' colours, paper, and\r\ntea, without any pretence of regulating commerce, but for the announced\r\npurpose of defraying the expenses {41} of governors and judges in the\r\ncolonies.  Another measure established an American Board of\r\nCommissioners for customs.  Still another punished the province of New\r\nYork for failing to comply with an Act of 1765 authorizing quartering\r\nof troops in the colonies.  The assembly was forbidden to pass any law\r\nuntil it should make provision for the soldiers in question.\r\nEx-governor Pownall of Massachusetts, now in Parliament, did not fail\r\nto warn the House of the danger into which it was running; but his\r\nwords were unheeded, and the Bills passed promptly.\r\n\r\nThe result of these measures was inevitable.  Every political leader in\r\nthe colonies--nay, every voter--saw that the Townshend duties, while in\r\nform \"external,\" were pure revenue measures, unconnected with the Acts\r\nof Trade, and intended to strike at colonial independence in a vital\r\npoint.  If Great Britain undertook henceforward to pay the salaries of\r\nroyal officials, one of the principal sources of power would be taken\r\naway from the assemblies.  Instantly the distinction of \"external\" and\r\n\"internal\" taxation was abandoned; and from end to end of the Atlantic\r\nseaboard a cry went up that the duties were an insidious attack on the\r\nliberties of the Americans, an outrageous taking of their property\r\nwithout their consent, and a wanton interference with their {42}\r\ngovernments.  Not merely agitators such as the shrewd Samuel Adams and\r\nthe eloquent Patrick Henry uttered these views, but men of far more\r\nconsiderable property and station--such as John Jay and New York\r\nlandowners and importers, John Dickinson and the Philadelphia\r\nmerchants, George Washington and the Virginia planters.  While no\r\ngeneral Congress was summoned, the legislatures of the colonies adopted\r\nelaborate resolutions, pamphleteers issued a stream of denunciations,\r\nand, most important of all, a concerted effort was made to break down\r\nthe Acts by abstaining from any importations, not only of the taxed\r\ncommodities, but, so far as possible, of any British products.\r\nCommercial boycott, it was hoped, would have the same effect as at the\r\ntime of the Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nBy this time the colonial argument had come to assume a much broader\r\ncharacter, for, in order to deny the validity of the New York Assembly\r\nAct and the Townshend duties, it became necessary to assert that\r\nParliament, according to \"natural rights,\" had no legislative authority\r\nover the internal affairs of a colony.  This was vested, by the\r\nconstitution of each province or chartered colony, in the Crown and the\r\ncolonial legislature.  Such a theory reduced the imperial tie to little\r\nmore than a personal union through the monarch, coupled with the {43}\r\nadmitted power of Parliament to regulate commerce and navigation.\r\nEvidently, as in all such cases, the theory was framed to justify a\r\nparticular desire, namely, to keep things where they had been prior to\r\n1763.  The sole question at issue was, in reality, one of power, not of\r\nabstract or legal right.  Once more it was clear to men of penetrating\r\nvision that the American colonies needed extremely careful handling.\r\nWhether their arguments were sound or fallacious, loyal or seditious,\r\nit was significant that the whole continent spoke with one voice and\r\nfelt but one desire--to be allowed to exercise complete financial\r\ndiscretion and to retain full control over governors and judges.\r\nUnfortunately the condition of things in England was such that a cool\r\nor steady treatment of the question was becoming impossible.  In the\r\nfirst place, the Grafton Ministry was reconstituted in 1768, the\r\n\"Pittite\" elements withdrawing, and being replaced by more King's\r\nFriends and Tories, while George III's influence grew predominant.\r\nTownshend died in September, 1767, but his place was taken by Lord\r\nNorth, a Tory and especially subservient to the King.  A new\r\nsecretaryship for the colonies was given to Lord Hillsborough, who had\r\nbeen in the Board of Trade in the Grenville Ministry, and represented\r\nhis views.  Neither of these {44} men was inclined to consider colonial\r\nclamour in any other light than as unpardonable impudence and sedition.\r\nIn the second place, the old Whig family groups were fast assuming an\r\nattitude of bitter opposition to the new Tories, and by 1768 were\r\nprepared to use the American question as a convenient weapon to\r\ndiscredit the Ministry.  They were quite as aristocratic in temper as\r\nthe ministerial party, but advocated forbearance, conciliation, and\r\ncalmness in dealing with the Americans, in speeches as remarkable for\r\ntheir political good sense as for their ferocity toward North,\r\nHillsborough, and the rest.  While the Ministry drew its views of the\r\nAmerican situation from royal governors and officials, the Whigs\r\nhabitually consulted with Franklin and the other colonial agents, who\r\noccupied a quasi-diplomatic position.  Thus the American question\r\nbecame a partisan battleground.  The Tories, attacked by the Whigs,\r\ndeveloped a stubborn obstinacy in holding to a \"firm\" colonial policy,\r\nand exhibited a steady contempt and anger toward their American\r\nadversaries which was in no small degree due to the English party\r\nantagonism.\r\n\r\nStill further to confuse the situation, there occurred at this time the\r\ncontest of John Wilkes, backed by the London mob, against the Grafton\r\nMinistry.  This demagogue, able {45} and profligate, had already come\r\ninto conflict with the Grenville Ministry in 1765, and had been driven\r\ninto exile.  Now, in 1768, he returned and was repeatedly elected to\r\nthe Commons, and as often unseated by the vindictive ministerial\r\nmajority.  Riots and bloodshed accompanied the agitation; and Wilkes\r\nand his supporters, backed by the parliamentary Whigs, habitually\r\nproclaimed the same doctrines of natural rights which were universally\r\nasserted in America.  To the King and his Cabinet, Wilkes and the\r\nAmerican leaders appeared indistinguishable.  They were all brawling,\r\ndisorderly, and dangerous demagogues, deserving of no consideration.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the complaints of the colonists, although\r\nsupported by the Whigs and by Chatham, received scant courtesy in\r\nEngland.  The Grafton Ministry showed nothing but an irritated\r\nintention to maintain imperial supremacy by insisting on the taxes and\r\ndemanding submissiveness on the part of the assemblies.  A series of\r\n\"firm\" instructions was sent out by Hillsborough, typical of which was\r\nan order that the Massachusetts legislature must rescind its circular\r\nletter of protest under threat of dissolution, and that the other\r\nassemblies must repudiate the letter under a similar menace.  The sole\r\nresult was a series of embittered wrangles, dissolutions, protests,\r\n{46} and quarrels which left the colonists still more inflamed.  Then,\r\nat the suggestion of the Commissioners of Customs, two regiments of\r\ntroops were sent to Boston to over-awe that particularly defiant\r\ncolony.  There being no legislature in session, the Massachusetts towns\r\nsent delegates to a voluntary convention which drafted a protest.\r\nImmediately, this action was denounced by Hillsborough as seditious and\r\nwas censured by Parliament; while the Duke of Bedford moved that an old\r\nstatute of Henry VIII, by which offenders outside the realm could be\r\nbrought to England for trial, should be put into operation against the\r\ncolonial agitators.  When the Virginia legislature protested against\r\nthis step, it was dissolved.  Hillsborough and North acted as though\r\nthey believed that a policy of scolding and nagging, if made\r\nsufficiently disagreeable, would bring the colonists to their senses.\r\nThat the Whigs did not cease to pour contempt and ridicule on the folly\r\nof such behaviour was probably one reason why the government persisted\r\nin its course.  The American question was coming to be beyond the reach\r\nof reason.\r\n\r\nYet in 1769 the Ministry could not avoid recognizing that as financial\r\nmeasures the Townshend duties were a hopeless failure, since their net\r\nproceeds were less than 300 pounds and the increased military expenses\r\nwere {47} declared by Pownall to be over 170,000 pounds.  On May 1,\r\n1769, the Cabinet voted to repeal the taxes on glass, colours, and\r\npaper, but by a majority of one determined to keep the tea duty.  This\r\ndecision was due to the complaisance of Lord North, who saw the\r\nunwisdom of the step, but yielded to the King's wish to retain one tax\r\nin order to assert the principle of parliamentary supremacy.  A year\r\nlater, the Grafton Ministry finally broke up; and Lord North assumed\r\ncontrol, with a Cabinet composed wholly of Tories and supported by\r\nGeorge III to the full extent of his power, through patronage, bribes,\r\nsocial pressure, and political proscription.  North himself was\r\ninclined to moderation in colonial matters.  He carried the promised\r\nrepeal of all the duties but the tea tax, and in 1772 replaced the\r\narrogant and quarrelsome Hillsborough with the more amiable Lord\r\nDartmouth.  It looked for a while as though the political skies might\r\nclear, for the American merchants, tired of their self-imposed\r\nhardships, began to weaken in opposition.  In 1769 the New York\r\nassembly voted to accept the parliamentary terms; and in 1770 the\r\nmerchants of that colony voted to abandon general non-importation,\r\nkeeping only the boycott on tea.  This led to the general collapse of\r\nthe non-importation agreements; but the colonial temper continued to be\r\ndefiant and {48} suspicious, and wrangling with governors was incessant.\r\n\r\nOccasional cases of violence confirmed the English Tories in their low\r\nview of the Americans.  In March, 1770, a riot in Boston between town\r\nrowdies and the soldiers brought on a shooting affray in which five\r\ncitizens were killed.  This created intense indignation throughout the\r\ncolonies, regardless of the provocation received by the soldiers, and\r\nled to an annual commemoration of the \"Boston Massacre,\" marked by\r\ninflammatory speeches.  The soldiers, however, when tried for murder in\r\nthe local courts, were defended by prominent counsel, notably John\r\nAdams, and were acquitted.  Two years later, on June 9, 1772, the\r\n_Gaspee_, a naval schooner, which had been very active in chasing\r\nsmugglers in Rhode Island waters, was burned by a mob, and its captain\r\ntaken prisoner.  The utmost efforts of the home government failed to\r\nsecure the detection or punishment of any one of the perpetrators.\r\n\r\nFinally, in December, 1773, a still more serious explosion occurred.\r\nThe North Ministry, desirous of assisting the East India Company, which\r\nwas burdened with debt, removed practically all restrictions on the\r\nexportation of tea to America in hopes of increasing the sale by\r\nreducing the price.  To the colonial leaders, now in a state of {49}\r\nchronic irritation, this measure seemed an insulting and insidious\r\nattempt to induce the Americans to forget their principles and buy the\r\ntea because it was cheap.  It was denounced from end to end of the\r\ncountry in burning rhetoric; and when the cargoes of tea arrived their\r\nsale was completely prevented by the overwhelming pressure of public\r\nopinion.  Consignees, waited on by great crowds, hastened to resign;\r\nand the tea was either seized for nonpayment of duties and allowed to\r\nspoil, or was sent back.  In Boston, however, the Governor, Hutchinson,\r\nstiffly refused to let the tea ships depart without landing the tea,\r\nwhereat the exasperated citizens watched an organized mob of disguised\r\nmen board the ships and throw the tea into the harbour.  Once more the\r\nunanimous voice of the colonies defied a parliamentary Act.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation in 1773.  Thirteen groups of British colonists,\r\nobstinately local in their interests, narrowly insistent on\r\nself-government, habituated to an antagonistic attitude toward royal\r\ngovernors, but, after all has been said, unquestionably loyal to the\r\nCrown and the home country, had been transformed into communities on\r\nthe verge of permanent insubordination.  Incapable of changing all\r\ntheir political habits, they could see in the British policy only a\r\npurpose {50} to deprive them of that self-government which was\r\ninseparable from liberty.  The Crown Ministers, on the other hand,\r\nunable to discover anything illegal, oppressive, or unreasonable in any\r\nof their measures, found no explanation of the extravagant\r\ndenunciations of the colonial radicals other than a determination to\r\nfoment every possible difficulty with a view to throwing off all\r\nobedience.  While Adams, Dickinson, Henry, Gadsden and the rest\r\ndemanded their \"rights,\" and protested against \"incroachments\" on their\r\nliberties, Bedford, Hillsborough, North, and Dartmouth insisted on the\r\n\"indecency,\" \"insolence,\" and \"disloyalty\" shown by the Americans.  The\r\ncolonial republicans and the British noblemen were unable to speak the\r\nsame language.  Yet the time had come to face the situation, and it was\r\nthe duty of the Ministers to assume the task with something more\r\nserious than reproofs and legal formulae.  The contest for power now\r\nbegun must lead, unless terminated, straight to a disruption of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{51}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DISRUPTION OF THE EMPIRE, 1773-1776\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached England that the people of the town of Boston had\r\nthrown the tea of the East India Company into the harbour, the patience\r\nof the North ministry, already severely strained, reached an end.  Its\r\nmembers felt--and most of the English people felt with them--that to\r\nsubmit to such an act of violence was impossible.  Every consideration\r\nof national dignity demanded that Boston and its rioters should be\r\npunished, and that the outrage done to the East India Company should\r\nreceive atonement.  Hitherto, they said, the contumacious colonists had\r\nbeen dealt with chiefly by arguments, reproofs, and, as it seemed to\r\nmost Englishmen, with concessions and kindnesses which had won only\r\ninsult and violence.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to make an example of the delinquent community; and the\r\nfirst step was to humiliate its representative, Benjamin Franklin.\r\nEver since 1765 he had been residing in England, respected as a\r\nphilosopher and admired as a wit, bearing a sort of diplomatic\r\ncharacter through his position as agent for the assemblies of\r\nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.  In close {52} association\r\nwith the Whig opposition, he was undoubtedly the best-known American,\r\nand among the most influential.  Now, in 1774, having to present a\r\npetition from Massachusetts to the Privy Council for the removal of\r\nLieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, Franklin found it an awkward feature of\r\nthe case that the colony's charges were based on private letters which\r\nhe himself had in some way acquired and sent to Boston.  The Court\r\nparty determined to crush him, and at the hearing put forward\r\nWedderburn, the Solicitor-General--a typical King's Friend--who passed\r\nover the subject of the petition to brand Franklin in virulent\r\ninvective as a thief and scoundrel.  Amidst general applause, the\r\npetition was rejected as false and scandalous, and Franklin was\r\ndismissed from his position of colonial Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met, it was instantly made clear that the sole idea\r\ncontrolling King, Cabinet, and the majority of Members was to bring the\r\nMassachusetts colonists to their senses by severe punitive legislation.\r\nThe Whig opposition did not attempt to defend the destruction of the\r\ntea; but it spared no effort to make the Ministers see the folly of\r\nstriking at effects and ignoring causes.  In a masterly speech of April\r\n19, 1774, Burke showed that the insistence on submission regardless of\r\nthe grievances and of the nature {53} of the colonists was a dangerous\r\nand absurd policy, and Pownall and Chatham repeated his arguments, but\r\nwithout avail.  The Ministerial party saw no danger, and felt nothing\r\nbut the contempt of an irritated aristocracy.  The original ideals of a\r\ngeneral colonial reform were now lost sight of; the men responsible for\r\nthem had all passed off the stage; Grenville, Townshend, and Halifax\r\nwere dead, and North, careless and subservient to George III,\r\nHillsborough, Suffolk, Sandwich, and Rochford--all noblemen, and in\r\nmany cases inefficient--did not see beyond the problem of coercing\r\nnoisy and troublesome rioters, indistinguishable from the followers of\r\nWilkes.  Over and over again they reiterated that the colonists'\r\nresentment was not to be feared, that they would submit to genuine\r\nfirmness, that they were all cowardly and dared not resist a few\r\nregular troops.  Lord George Germaine earned the thanks of Lord North\r\nby declaring that the colonists were only \"a tumultuous and noisy\r\nrabble,\" men who ought to be \"following their mercantile employment and\r\nnot attempting to govern.\"  Not a gleam of any other statesmanship\r\nappears in any of the Ministerial speeches than that displayed in the\r\ndetermination to exact complete submission.\r\n\r\nThere were passed, accordingly, by the full Ministerial majority, five\r\nmeasures known as {54} the Coercive Acts, or, in America, as the Five\r\nIntolerable Acts.  The first one punished Boston by closing the port to\r\nall trade until the offending town should recompense the East India\r\nCompany for the tea destroyed.  The next altered the government of\r\nMassachusetts Bay by making the councillors appointive instead of\r\nelective, by placing the appointment and removal of all judicial\r\nofficers entirely in the hands of the governor, by placing the\r\nselection of jurors in the hands of the sheriffs and prohibiting\r\ntown-meetings--apart from the annual one to elect officers--without the\r\ngovernor's permission.  A third Act authorized the transfer to England\r\nfor trial of British officers charged with murder committed while in\r\ndischarge of their duties.  A fourth Act re-established the system of\r\nquartering troops.\r\n\r\nThe fifth Act reorganized the province of Quebec, whose government,\r\nunder the Proclamation of 1763, had proved defective in several\r\nrespects.  The legal institutions of the new colony were not well\r\nadapted to the mixed French and British inhabitants, and the religious\r\nsituation needed definition.  The Quebec Act altered the government of\r\nthe province by the creation of an appointive council, authorized the\r\nCatholic Church to collect tithes, and allow the French to substitute\r\nan oath of allegiance for the oath of {55} supremacy.  Moreover, French\r\ncivil law was permitted to exist.  At the same time the boundaries of\r\nthe province were extended into the region west of the mountains so as\r\nto include the lands north of the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of these Acts, the original causes for antagonism were\r\nsuperseded.  The commissioners of customs might have enforced the\r\nNavigation Acts indefinitely; the objectionable Tea Act might have\r\nstood permanently on the statute-book; but, without a more tangible\r\ngrievance, it is not easy to conceive of the colonists actually\r\nbeginning a revolution.  The time had now come when a more serious\r\nissue was raised than the right of Parliament to collect a revenue by a\r\ntariff in the colonies.  If Parliament was to be allowed to crush the\r\nprosperity of a colonial seaport, to centralize a hitherto democratic\r\ngovernment created by a royal charter, and to remove royal officers\r\nfrom the scope of colonial juries, it was clear that the end of all the\r\npowers and privileges wrung from royal or proprietary governors by\r\ngenerations of struggle was at hand.  Yet the striking feature in this\r\npunitive legislation was that the North Ministry expected it to meet no\r\nresistance, although its execution, so far as the government of\r\nMassachusetts was concerned, rested on the consent of the colonists.\r\nThere was, under the British {56} system, no administrative body\r\ncapable of carrying out these laws, no military force except the few\r\nregiments in Boston, and no naval force beyond a few frigates and\r\ncruisers.  The mere passage of the laws, according to North and to Lord\r\nMansfield, was sufficient to bring submission.\r\n\r\nNothing more clearly shows the profound ignorance of the Tory Ministry\r\nthan this expectation, for it was instantly disappointed.  At the news\r\nof the Acts, the response from America was unanimous.  Already the\r\ncolonial Whigs were well organized in committees of correspondence, and\r\nnow they acted not merely in Massachusetts but in every colony.  The\r\ntown of Boston refused to vote compensation, and was immediately closed\r\nunder the terms of the Port Act.  Expressions of sympathy and gifts of\r\nprovisions came pouring into the doomed community; while public\r\nmeetings, legislatures, political leaders and clergymen, in chorus\r\ndenounced the Acts as unconstitutional, cruel, and tyrannous.  The\r\nQuebec Act, extending the Catholic religion and French law into the\r\ninterior valley under despotic government, was regarded as scarcely\r\nless sinister than the Regulating Act itself.\r\n\r\nUnder the efficient organization of the leaders a Continental Congress\r\nmet in Philadelphia in October, 1774, to make united {57} protest.\r\nThis body, comprising without exception the most influential men in the\r\ncolonies, presented a clear contrast to Parliament in that every man\r\nwas the representative of a community of freemen, self-governing and\r\nequal before the law.  The leaders did not regard themselves in any\r\nsense as revolutionaries.  They were simply delegates from the separate\r\ncolonies, met to confer on their common dangers.  Their action\r\nconsisted in the preparation of a petition to the King, addresses to\r\nthe people of England, the people of Quebec, and the people of the\r\ncolonies, but not to Parliament, since they denied its right to pass\r\nany such laws as those under complaint.  The Congress further drew up a\r\ndeclaration of rights which stated sharply the colonial claims, namely,\r\nthat Parliament had no right to legislate for the internal affairs of\r\nthe separate colonies.  It also adopted a plan for putting commercial\r\npressure on England by forming an Association whose members pledged\r\nthemselves to consume no English products, and organize committees in\r\nevery colony to enforce this boycott.  The leaders in the body were\r\ndestined to long careers of public prominence--such men as George\r\nWashington, Lee, and Patrick Henry of Virginia, Rutledge of South\r\nCarolina, Dickinson of Pennsylvania, Jay of New York, Samuel and John\r\nAdams of {58} Massachusetts.  They differed considerably in their\r\ntemper, the Massachusetts men being far more ready for drastic words\r\nand deeds than the others; but they held together admirably.  If such\r\nprotests as theirs could not win a hearing in England, it was hardly\r\nconceivable that any could.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the situation gave signs of being more explosive in reality\r\nthan the respectful words of the Congress implied.  In Massachusetts,\r\nthe town of Boston showed no sign of submitting, and endured distress\r\nand actual starvation, although much cheered by gifts of food from all\r\nparts of the continent.  The new government under the Regulating Act\r\nproved impossible to put into operation, for the popular detestation\r\nwas visited in such insulting and menacing forms that the new\r\ncouncillors and judges dared not serve.  More radical action followed.\r\nWhen Gage, having caused the election of a legislature, prorogued it\r\nbefore it had assembled, the members none the less gathered.  Declaring\r\nthat the Regulating Act was invalid, they elected a council, appointed\r\na committee of safety, and named a receiver of taxes.  On February 1,\r\n1775, a second Provincial Congress was chosen by the towns, which had\r\nnot even a nominal sanction by the governor.  The colony was, in fact,\r\nin peaceful revolution, for Gage found himself unable to collect {59}\r\ntaxes or to make his authority respected as governor beyond the range\r\nof his bayonets.  Equally significant was it that in several other\r\ncolonies, where the governors failed to call the legislatures,\r\nprovincial congresses or conventions were spontaneously elected to\r\nsupervise the situation and choose delegates to the Continental\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nSo deep was the popular anger in Massachusetts Bay that the collection\r\nof arms and powder and the organization of militia were rapidly begun.\r\nClearly, the Massachusetts leaders were preparing to persist to the\r\nverge of civil war.  But by this time there began to be felt in the\r\ncolonies a countercurrent of protest.  As the situation grew darker,\r\nand men talked openly of possible separation unless the intolerable\r\nwrongs were redressed, all those whose interests or whose loyalty\r\nrevolted at the idea of civil war became alarmed at the danger.  Soon\r\nmen of such minds began to print pamphlets, according to the fashion of\r\nthe time, and to attempt to prevent the radicals from pushing the\r\ncolonies into seditious courses.  But the position of these\r\nconservatives was exceedingly difficult, for they were obliged to\r\napologize for the home country at a time when every act on the part of\r\nthat country indicated a complete indifference to colonial prejudices.\r\nTheir arguments against {60} revolution or independence left, after\r\nall, no alternative except submission.  Denounced as Tories by the\r\nhotter radicals, they found themselves at once more and more alarmed by\r\nthe daring actions of the Whigs, and more detested by the excited\r\npeople of their communities.\r\n\r\nThe action of the British government after these events showed no\r\ncomprehension of the critical situation into which they were rushing.\r\nGeorge III and North secured in the election of 1774 a triumphant\r\nmajority of the Commons, and felt themselves beyond reach of danger at\r\nhome.  The arguments of the colonists, the protests of the Continental\r\nCongress, fell upon indifferent ears.  Although Burke and Chatham\r\nexerted themselves with astonishing eloquence in the session of\r\nParliament which began in November 1774, the Whig motions for\r\nconciliation were voted down by the full Ministerial majority.\r\nPetitions from merchants, who felt the pressure of the Non-importation\r\nAssociation, were shelved.  So far as the policy of the Ministry may be\r\ndescribed, it consisted of legislation to increase the punishment of\r\nMassachusetts Bay and extend it to other colonies, and to offer a\r\nconditional exemption from Parliamentary taxation.  Both houses of\r\nParliament declared Massachusetts Bay to be in rebellion, and voted to\r\n{61} crush all resistance.  An Act was passed on March 30, to restrain\r\nthe trade of New England, shutting off all colonial vessels from the\r\nfisheries, and forbidding them to trade with any country but England or\r\nIreland.  By a second Act, in April, this restriction was extended to\r\nall the colonies except New York and Georgia.  The only purpose of this\r\nAct was punitive.  Every step was fought by the Whig opposition, now\r\nthoroughly committed to the cause of the colonists, but their arguments\r\nhad the inherent weakness of offering only a surrender to the\r\ncolonists' position which the parliamentary majority was in no mood to\r\nconsider.  In fact it was only with great difficulty and after a stormy\r\nscene that North induced his party to vote a so-called conciliatory\r\nproposition offering to abstain from taxing any colony which should\r\nmake such a fixed provision for civil and judicial officers as would\r\nsatisfy Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few days after the passage of the restraining Acts by\r\nParliament that the long-threatened civil war actually broke out in\r\nMassachusetts.  General Gage, aware of the steady gathering of powder\r\nand war material by the revolutionary committee of safety, finally came\r\nto the conclusion that his position required him to break up these\r\nthreatening bases of supplies.  On April 19, 1775, he sent out a force\r\nof 800 men to {62} Lexington and Concord--towns a few miles from\r\nBoston--with orders to seize or destroy provisions and arms.  They\r\naccomplished their purpose, after dispersing with musketry a squad of\r\nfarmers at Lexington, but were hunted back to Boston by many times\r\ntheir number of excited \"minute men,\" who from behind fences and at\r\nevery crossroad harassed their retreat.  A reinforcement of 1500 men\r\nenabled the raiding party to escape, but they lost over 800 men, and\r\ninflicted a total loss of only 90 in their flight.\r\n\r\nThus began the American Revolution, for the news of this day of bloody\r\nskirmishing, as it spread, started into flame the excitement of the\r\ncolonial Whigs.  From the other New England colonies men sprang to\r\narms, and companies marched to Boston, where they remained in rude\r\nblockade outside the town, unprovided with artillery or military\r\norganization, but unwilling to return to their homes.  From the\r\nhill-towns, a band of men surprised Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain,\r\ntaking the cannon for use around Boston.  In every other colony militia\r\nwere organized, officers chosen and arms collected, and almost\r\neverywhere, except in Quaker Pennsylvania and in proprietary Maryland,\r\nthe governors and royal officials fled to the seacoast to take refuge\r\nin royal ships of war, or resigned their positions at the command {63}\r\nof crowds of armed \"minute men.\"  Conventions and congresses, summoned\r\nby committees of safety, were elected by the Whigs and assumed control\r\nof the colonies, following the example of Massachusetts.  The British\r\ncolonial government, in short, crumbled to nothing in the spring of\r\n1775.  Only Gage's force of a few regiments, shut up in Boston, and a\r\nfew naval vessels, represented the authority of England in America.\r\n\r\nAgain there met a Continental Congress at Philadelphia, whose duty it\r\nwas to unify colonial action and to give the colonial answer to the\r\nlate parliamentary acts.  Once more the ablest men of the colonies were\r\npresent, now gravely perturbed over the situation, and divided into two\r\ncamps.  On the one hand, most of the New Englanders, led by Samuel\r\nAdams and John Adams, his cousin, felt that the time for parley was at\r\nan end, that nothing was to be hoped for from the North Ministry, and\r\nthat the only reasonable step was to declare independence.  Others\r\nstill hoped that George III would realize the extent of the crisis and\r\nbe moved to concessions, while yet others, who hoped little, thought\r\nthat one more effort should be made to avoid revolution.  But none\r\ndreamed of surrender.  Of the growing number of Americans who recoiled\r\nin horror from {64} the possibility of independence, and were beginning\r\nto show their dread in every way, not one was in this body.  It\r\nrepresented only the radicals in the several colonies.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has been charged with inconsistency, for some of its\r\nmeasures were impelled by the most radical members, others by the\r\nconservatives.  On the one hand, it declined to adopt a form of\r\nfederation suggested by Franklin, and authorized Dickinson to draw up a\r\nfinal, respectful, almost obsequious petition to the King to avoid\r\nwar--a document called the \"Olive Branch\"; but, on the other hand, it\r\nappointed Washington to command the troops near Boston as a Continental\r\ncommander, adopted a report censuring the conciliatory proposition in\r\nbold language, and issued an address justifying with extravagant\r\nrhetoric the taking up of arms.  Still more daring, it went so far as\r\nto arrange to pay the so-called \"Continental army\" by means of bills of\r\ncredit, redeemable by the united colonies.  Later, in 1775, it\r\nappointed a secret committee to correspond with friends abroad, and\r\nundertook extensive measures for raising troops and accumulating\r\nmilitary stores.  To the revolted colonies, who found themselves with\r\nno legal authorities, it gave the advice to form such governments as\r\nwould secure peace and good order during the continuance {65} of the\r\nexisting dispute, a step which was promptly taken by several.\r\n\r\nFighting meanwhile went on.  General Gage, on June 17, undertook to\r\ndrive from Charlestown, across the harbour from Boston, a body of about\r\n1,500 provincial troops who had intrenched themselves on Breed's Hill.\r\nIn all, about 3,000 British were brought to the attack, while gunboats\r\nraked the peninsula between Charlestown and the mainland, hindering the\r\narrival of reinforcements.  With true British contempt for their\r\nadversaries, the lines of red-uniformed troops marched under the hot\r\nsun up the hill, to be met with a merciless fire at short range from\r\nthe rifles, muskets, and fowling pieces of the defenders.  Two frontal\r\nattacks were thus repelled with murderous slaughter; but a third\r\nattack, delivered over the same ground, was pushed home, and the\r\ndefenders were driven from their redoubt.  Never was a victory more\r\nhandsomely won or more dearly bought.  The assailants lost not less\r\nthan 1,000 out of 3,000 engaged, including 92 officers.  The Americans\r\nlost only 450, but that was almost as large a proportion.  It was\r\nobvious to any intelligent officer that the Americans might have been\r\ncut off from behind and compelled to surrender without being attacked;\r\nbut Gage and his subordinates were anxious to teach the rebels a\r\nlesson.  The {66} result of this action, known in history as \"Bunker\r\nHill,\" was to render him and nearly all the officers who served against\r\nAmericans unwilling ever again to storm intrenchments.  They discovered\r\nthat, as Putnam, who commanded part of the forces, observed, the\r\nmilitia would fight well if their legs were covered.  They were later\r\nto discover the converse, that with no protection militia were almost\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nFrom this time the British force remained quietly in Boston, fed and\r\nsupplied from England at immense cost, and making no effort to attack\r\nthe miscellaneous levies which General Washington undertook to form\r\ninto an army during the summer and autumn.  Nothing but the inaction of\r\nthe British made it possible for Washington's command to remain, for\r\nthey lacked powder, bayonets, horses and, most serious of all, they\r\nlacked all military conceptions.  The elementary idea of obedience was\r\ninconceivable to them.  Washington's irritation over the perfectly\r\nunconcerned democracy of the New Englanders was extreme; but he showed\r\na wonderful patience and tenacity, and by sheer persistence began to\r\ncreate something like a military organization.  Yet, even after months\r\nof drill and work the army remained little more than an armed mob.  At\r\nlength, in March, 1776, Washington managed to {67} place a force on\r\nDorchester heights, which commanded the harbour from the south.  At\r\nfirst Gage had some idea of attacking, but storms intervened; and\r\nfinally, without another blow, he evacuated the city and sailed with\r\nall his force to Halifax.  So ended a siege which ought never to have\r\nlasted a month had the British generals been seriously minded to break\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nOther military events consisted of a few skirmishes in Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina, where the governors managed to raise small forces of\r\nloyalists, who were thoroughly defeated by the Whig militia, and of a\r\ngallant but hopeless attempt by the rebels to capture Canada.  After\r\nsome futile efforts on the part of Congress to induce the French to\r\nrevolt, two bodies of men, in the autumn of 1775, made their way across\r\nthe border.  One, entering Canada by way of Lake Champlain, occupied\r\nMontreal, and then advanced against Quebec, where it was joined by the\r\nother, which, with great hardships, had penetrated through the\r\nwilderness of northern Maine.  The commanders, Richard Montgomery,\r\nBenedict Arnold, and Daniel Morgan of Virginia, were men of daring, but\r\ntheir force, numbering not more than 1,000, was inadequate; and, after\r\nthe failure of an effort to carry the place by surprise on the night of\r\nDecember 31--in which Montgomery was {68} killed and Morgan\r\ncaptured--they were unable to do more than maintain a blockade outside\r\nthe fortress.\r\n\r\nThe action of the North Ministry during these months showed no\r\ndeviation from its policy of enforcing submission.  The Olive Branch\r\npetition was refused a reception, and a proclamation was issued\r\ndeclaring the colonies in rebellion and warning all subjects against\r\ntraitorous correspondence.  When Parliament met in November, 1775, the\r\nopposition, led as usual by Burke, made one more effort to avoid civil\r\nwar; but the Ministerial party rejected all proposals for conciliation,\r\nand devoted itself to preparing to crush the rebellion.  On December\r\n22, an Act became law which, if enforced, would have been a sentence of\r\ndeath to all colonial economic life.  It superseded the Boston Port Act\r\nand the restraining Acts, absolutely prohibited all commerce with the\r\nrevolted colonies, and authorized the impressment into the navy of all\r\nseamen found on vessels captured under the Act.\r\n\r\nMilitary and naval preparations were slow and costly.  The Admiralty\r\nand War Office, unprepared for a general war, had insufficient troops\r\nand sailors, and had to collect or create supplies and equipment.  The\r\nEarl of Sandwich showed activity but slight capacity as First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty.  Viscount {69} Barrington had been Secretary at War\r\nunder Pitt during the French war, but he lacked force and influence.\r\nHence, although Parliament voted 50,000 troops, there was confusion and\r\ndelay.  To secure a prompt supply of men, the Ministry took the step of\r\nhiring German mercenaries from the lesser Rhine princes--Hesse,\r\nWaldeck, and others,--at a rate per head with a fixed sum for deaths.\r\nThis practice was customary in wars when England was obliged to protect\r\nHanover from the French; but to use the same method against their own\r\nkindred in America was looked upon with aversion by many English, and\r\naroused ungovernable indignation in all Americans.  It seemed to show a\r\ncallousness toward all ties of blood and speech which rendered any hope\r\nof reconciliation futile.  The war was not, in fact, popular in\r\nEngland.  The task of conquering rebels was not relished by many, and\r\nofficers and noblemen of Whig connections in some cases resigned their\r\ncommissions rather than serve.  The parliamentary opposition denounced\r\nthe war with fiery zeal as an iniquity and a scandal.  Nevertheless,\r\nthe general opinion in England supported the Ministry in its\r\ndetermination to assert the national strength; for the colonial\r\nbehaviour seemed to the average Englishman as nothing more or less than\r\nimpudent sedition, to yield to which would be disgrace.\r\n\r\n{70}\r\n\r\nTo the Americans, the British action in 1776 showed that the only\r\nalternatives were submission or fighting; and, if the latter must be\r\nchosen, then it was the feeling of a growing number that independence\r\nwas the only outcome.  There now went on a contest between\r\nconservatives, including on one side those who opposed all civil war,\r\nthose who were willing to fight to defend rights but who were unwilling\r\nto abandon hopes of forcing England to surrender its claims, and those\r\nwhose businesses and connections were closely interwoven with the\r\nmother country and all the radicals on the other.  Unfortunately for\r\nthe conservatives they had only fear, or sentiment, for arguments,\r\nsince the North Ministry gave them nothing to urge upon doubtful men.\r\nStill more unfortunately, they were, as a rule, outside the\r\nrevolutionary organizations of conventions and committees, and were\r\nthemselves without means of co-operating.\r\n\r\nIn the excitement and tension of the time, the ruder and rougher\r\nclasses tended to regard all reluctance to join in the revolution as\r\nequivalent to upholding the North policy, and to attack as Tories all\r\nwho did not heartily support the revolutionary cause.  Violence and\r\nintimidation rapidly made themselves felt.  Loyalists were threatened,\r\nforced by mobs to sign the Association; their houses {71} were defiled,\r\ntheir movements watched.  Then [Transcriber's note: Their?] arms were\r\ntaken from them, and if they showed anger or temper they were\r\noccasionally whipped or even tarred and feathered.  In this way a\r\ndetermined minority backed by the poorer and rougher classes, overrode\r\nall opposition and swelled a rising cry for independence.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was slow, for it felt the need of unanimity; and such\r\ncolonies as New York and Pennsylvania were controlled by moderates.\r\nBut at length, in June, 1776, spurred on by the Virginia delegates and\r\nby the tireless urgings of the Massachusetts leaders, the body acted.\r\nAlready some of the colonies had adopted constitutions whose language\r\nindicated their independence.  Now the Continental Congress, after a\r\nfinal debate, adopted a Declaration of Independence, drafted by\r\nJefferson of Virginia and supported by the eloquence of John Adams and\r\nthe influence of Franklin.  Basing their position on the doctrines of\r\nthe natural right of men to exercise full self-government and to change\r\ntheir form of government when it became oppressive, the colonies, in\r\nthis famous document, imitated the English Declaration of Rights of\r\n1689 in drawing up a bill of indictment against George III's\r\ngovernment.  In this can be discovered every cause of resentment and\r\nevery variety of {72} complaint which the thirteen colonies were ready\r\nto put forward.  Practically all were political.  There were allusions\r\nin plenty to the wrangles between governors and assemblies,\r\ndenunciations of the parliamentary taxes and the coercing Acts, but no\r\nreference to the Acts of Trade.  To the end, the colonists, even in the\r\nact of declaring independence, found their grievances in the field of\r\ngovernment and not in economic regulation.  What they wanted was the\r\nunrestricted power to legislate for themselves and to tax or refrain\r\nfrom taxing themselves.  When these powers were diminished, their whole\r\npolitical ideal was ruined, and they preferred independence to what\r\nthey considered servitude.  Such ideas were beyond the comprehension of\r\nmost Englishmen, to whom the whole thing was plain disloyalty, however\r\ncloaked in specious words and glittering generalities.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the rupture was due to a spirit of independence\r\nin America which, in spite of all disclaimers, was determined to be\r\nentirely free from the mother country.  Such was the assertion of the\r\nTories and officials of the time, and the same idea is not infrequently\r\nrepeated at the present day.  But the truth is that the colonists would\r\nhave been contented to remain indefinitely in union with England,\r\nsubjects of the British {73} crown, sharers of the British commercial\r\nempire, provided they could have been sure of complete local\r\nself-government.  The independence they demanded was far less than that\r\nnow enjoyed by the great colonial unions of Canada, Australia, and\r\nSouth Africa.  It may be assumed, of course, that unless Parliament\r\nexercised complete authority over internal as well as external\r\nmatters--to employ the then customary distinction--there was no real\r\nimperial bond.  Such was the position unanimously taken by the North\r\nMinistry and the Tories in 1776.  But in view of the subsequent history\r\nof the English colonies it seems hardly deniable that some relationship\r\nsimilar to the existing colonial one might have been perpetuated had\r\nthe Whig policy advocated by Burke been adopted, and the right of\r\nParliament \"to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever\" been allowed\r\nto drop, in practice.  The obstinate localism of the colonies was such\r\nthat not until a generation after the Revolution did a genuine American\r\nnational sentiment appear.  The colonies were driven to act together in\r\n1774-1776, but not to fuse, by a danger not to national but to local\r\nindependence.  This fact indicates how sharply defined was the field\r\nwhich the Americans insisted on having free from parliamentary\r\ninvasion.  Had it been possible for England {74} to recognize this\r\nfact, there would have been no revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, obvious that the traditional American view of the\r\nRevolution as caused by tyranny and oppression is symbolical, if not\r\nfictitious.  The British government, in all its measures, from 1763 to\r\n1774, was moderate, hesitating, and at worst irritating.  Its action\r\nthreatened to destroy the practical independence of the colonial\r\nassemblies; but the danger was political.  Even the five \"intolerable\r\nActs\" inflicted hardship on the town of Boston alone.  It was not until\r\nthe year 1775, when Parliament imposed severe commercial restrictions,\r\nthat anything resembling actual oppression began; but by that time the\r\ncolonies were in open revolt.\r\n\r\nThis fact only emphasizes, as Burke pointed out, the criminal folly of\r\nthe North Ministry in allowing the situation to become dangerous.  It\r\nwas the misfortune of the British people in the eighteenth century\r\nthat, in the critical years after 1767, George III and his Ministers\r\nwere unable to conceive of any value in colonies which were not in the\r\nfull sense dependencies, and were narrowly limited by the economic\r\nideas of their time and the social conventions of their class.  Since\r\nthe colonies had developed, unchecked, their own political life under\r\nBritish government, it was not their duty humbly to {75} surrender all\r\nthat had come to be identical with liberty in their eyes.  It was the\r\nduty of British statesmen to recognize the situation and deal with it.\r\nThis they failed to do, and the result was revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR IN THE EMPIRE, 1776-1778\r\n\r\nIn the war which now began, the military situation was such that\r\nneither side could look forward to an easy victory.  Great Britain\r\noutweighed the colonies in population by three or four to one, and in\r\nevery element of military strength to a much greater degree.  There was\r\na standing army, an ample sufficiency of professional officers, the\r\nmost powerful navy in the world, the full machinery of financial\r\nadministration, abundant credit, and wealthy manufacturing and\r\nagricultural classes which has already shown their power to carry the\r\nburdens of a world contest without flinching.  With a powerful party\r\nMinistry endowed with full discretion in the ordering of military\r\naffairs, there was little danger of divided {76} councils or of\r\ninability to secure responsible direction.  North, Sandwich at the\r\nAdmiralty, Barrington as Secretary at War, Germaine as Secretary for\r\nthe Colonies, could command the active support of the King, the\r\nParliament, and, it appeared, of the people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was necessary to carry on war at 3,000 miles\r\ndistance from the base of supplies, and to feed and clothe the armies\r\nentirely from home.  The cost was certain to be extremely heavy, and\r\nthe practical difficulties of management arising from the distance were\r\nsure to be great, unless a competent commander were to be given\r\ncomplete authority in the colonies.  Then, too, the problem was not one\r\nof conquering cities or single strategic points, or of defeating a\r\nrival state, but of so thoroughly beating down resistance as to lead\r\nthe Americans to abandon their revolution and submit to the extinction\r\nof their new-formed confederation.  Armies must operate inland from a\r\nseacoast where landing was easy in hundreds of places, but where almost\r\nevery step took them into a rough country, ill-provided with roads and\r\nlacking in easily collected supplies.  In spite of all advantages of\r\nmilitary power, the problem before the British government was one\r\ncalling for the highest forms of military capacity, and this, by an\r\nunexplained ill-fortune, was conspicuously {77} lacking.  Not a British\r\ngeneral who commanded in America failed to show fighting ability and\r\ntactical sense, but not one of them possessed the kind of genius which\r\ngrasps the true military ends of any campaign and ignores minor points\r\nfor the sake of winning decisive advantages.  Perhaps it would be\r\nunjust to apply to the British forces in this war the designation won\r\nin 1774--\"armies of lions led by asses\"; but the analogy is at least\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nStill more serious was the fact that the North Ministry was chosen\r\nmainly on the basis of the willingness of its members to execute the\r\nKing's orders and use their influence and parliamentary power and\r\nconnections in his behalf.  North himself, able as a parliamentarian,\r\nwas irresolute in policy, ignorant of war, and careless in\r\nadministration; Weymouth and Suffolk, the Secretaries, were of slight\r\nability; Lord George Germaine, Secretary for the Colonies, was\r\narrogant, careless, and lacking in military insight; Barrington,\r\nSecretary at War, possessed administrative ability, but was without\r\npersonal weight in the cabinet; Sandwich at the Admiralty was grossly\r\ninefficient.  There was not a single member of the Cabinet fitted to\r\ncarry on war, or able to influence George III.  For such a body of men\r\nto undertake to direct the operations in America {78} at the distance\r\nof 3,000 miles was a worse blunder than it would have been to commit\r\nthe conduct of the war to any one of the generals in the field, however\r\ncommonplace his abilities.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the colonists, the problem of fighting the full power of\r\nEngland was apparently a desperate one.  The militia, with superior\r\nnumbers, had chased the British from Concord, and had made a stubborn\r\ndefence at Bunker Hill; but the British were about to move with\r\noverwhelming strength.  To raise, equip, clothe, and feed armies was\r\nthe task of a strong administration, and there was nothing of the kind\r\nin America.  The ex-colonists not only had never known efficient\r\nadministration; they had fought against any and all administration for\r\ngenerations, and their leaders had won their fame as opponents of all\r\nexecutive power.  To thunder against royal oppression won applause, but\r\nindicated no ability at raising money and organizing such things as\r\ncommissariat, artillery, or a navy; and it may be said of such men as\r\nSamuel Adams, Robert Morris, Roger Sherman, John Rutledge, Patrick\r\nHenry, and Thomas Jefferson that their administrative training was as\r\nfar below that of their enemies in the North Ministry as their\r\npolitical capacity was, in general, superior.\r\n\r\n{79}\r\n\r\nThe Continental Congress, moreover, which assumed responsibility for\r\nthe army, could only recommend measures to the States, and call upon\r\nthem to furnish troops and money.  In contrast to the States, which\r\nderived their powers unquestionably from the voters within their\r\nboundaries and could command their obedience, the Congress had no legal\r\nor constitutional basis, and was nothing more than the meeting place of\r\ndelegates from voluntary allies.  Such military authority as it\r\nexercised rested entirely upon the general agreement of the States.\r\nNational government, in short, did not exist.  Still more serious was\r\nthe fact that there were very few trained officers in America.  The\r\nAmerican military leaders, such as Washington, Greene, Wayne, Sullivan,\r\nwere distinctly inferior in soldiership to their antagonists, although\r\nWashington and Greene developed greater strategic ability after many\r\nblunders.  It was only through sundry military adventurers, some\r\nEnglish--such as Montgomery, Gates, Lee, Conway,--others European--such\r\nas De Kalb, Steuben, Pulaski--that something of the military art could\r\nbe acquired.\r\n\r\nMost serious of all, there were no troops in America who comprehended\r\nthe nature of military discipline.  The conception of obedience to\r\norders, of military duty, of the {80} absolute necessity of holding\r\nsteady, was beyond the range of most Americans.  They regarded war as\r\nsomething to be carried on in their own neighbourhoods, and resisted\r\nobstinately being drawn outside their own States.  They refused to\r\nenlist for longer than a few months, since they felt it imperative to\r\nreturn to look after their farms.  They had little regard for men from\r\ndifferent districts, distrusted commanders from any State but their\r\nown, and had no loyalty of any description to the Continental Congress.\r\nThey were, in short, still colonists, such as generations of training\r\nhad made them; very angry with Great Britain, infuriated at Tories, and\r\nglad to be independent, but unable to realize the meaning of it all\r\neven under the terrible stress of war.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, the task of the men to whose lot it fell to\r\nlead the American forces was such as to tax to the utmost not only\r\ntheir military skill, but their ability to control, inspire, and\r\npersuade the most refractory and unreliable of material.  When to this\r\nwere added the facts that the colonies were almost wholly lacking in\r\nmanufactures except of the most rudimentary sort, that they had little\r\ncapital except in the form of land, buildings, vessels, and crops, and\r\nthat whatever revenue they had been in the habit of deriving from\r\ncommerce was {81} liable to be destroyed by the British naval\r\nsupremacy, it is easily seen that the disadvantages of the home country\r\nwere actually counterbalanced by the still more crushing disadvantages\r\nof the revolting colonies.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1776, the British advanced from two quarters.  In the\r\nnorth, as soon as navigation opened, men-of-war sailed up the St.\r\nLawrence and brought reinforcements to Quebec.  The relics of the\r\nAmerican force, unable to maintain themselves in Canada, abandoned\r\ntheir conquests without a blow, and retreated into the Lake Champlain\r\nregion, there intending to hold the forts at Crown Point and\r\nTiconderoga.  Col. Guy Carleton, the new commander, was soon able to\r\nmove southward with overwhelming numbers; but, after reaching the\r\nnorthern end of Lake Champlain, he found that body of water commanded\r\nby a small squadron of gunboats under Benedict Arnold, and, deeming it\r\nimpossible to advance, delayed all summer in order to construct a rival\r\nfleet.  Meanwhile, all operations came to a standstill in that region.\r\nEleven thousand men, chiefly regular troops, were thus kept inactive\r\nfor months.\r\n\r\nThe principal British force gathered at Halifax, and sailed directly\r\nagainst New York.  It was there joined by the remains of a naval\r\nexpedition which had endeavoured in June, {82} 1776, to capture\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, but had suffered severely in an attempt to\r\nbombard Fort Moultrie and been compelled to withdraw.  This success,\r\nwhich raised the spirits of the rebels, was, however, the last they\r\nwere to enjoy for many months.  The main British expedition was\r\nexpected to overpower all colonial resistance, for it comprised a fleet\r\nof men-of-war, and an army of no less than 81,000 men, including German\r\nmercenaries, fully equipped, drilled, and provisioned.  The admiral in\r\ncommand, Lord Howe, a Whig, was authorized to issue pardons in return\r\nfor submission, and evidently expected the mere presence of so powerful\r\nan armament to cause the collapse of all resistance.  His brother, Sir\r\nWilliam Howe, who commanded the army, was a good officer in actual\r\nfighting, but a man of little energy or activity, and unwilling,\r\napparently, to cause the revolted colonies any more suffering than was\r\nnecessary.  He was, moreover, quite without military insight of the\r\nlarger kind, failing to recognize the peculiar character of the war\r\nupon which he was entering and acting, when pushing on a campaign,\r\nprecisely as though he were operating against a European army in west\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all deficiencies, it seemed as though Howe could not fail\r\nto crush the {83} undisciplined collection of 17,000 militia and minute\r\nmen with which Washington endeavoured to meet him at New York.\r\nControlling the harbour and the rivers with his fleet, he could move\r\nanywhere and direct superior numbers against any American position.\r\nThe first blow, struck after futile efforts at negotiation, was aimed\r\nat an American force which held Brooklyn Heights on Long Island.  About\r\n20,000 British and Hessian troops were landed on August 22; and five\r\ndays later they outflanked and crushed a body of Americans placed to\r\nobstruct their advance.  There remained the American intrenchments,\r\nwhich were weak and ill-defended; but Howe refused to attack, probably\r\nwith memories of Bunker Hill in his mind.  Washington managed, owing to\r\nfavourable rainy weather, to remove his beaten force by night on August\r\n29, but only the inaction of Howe enabled them to escape capture.\r\n\r\nThere followed a delay of two weeks, during which Admiral Howe\r\ntried to secure an interview with American leaders, in hopes of\r\ninducing the rebels to submit; but, finding Franklin, Adams and\r\nRutledge--commissioners named by Congress--immovably committed to\r\nindependence, he was compelled to renew hostilities.  There ensued a\r\nslow campaign in which General Howe easily {84} forced Washington to\r\nevacuate New York, to retreat northward, and after various skirmishes\r\nto withdraw over the Hudson River into New Jersey.  At no time did\r\nWashington risk a general engagement; at no time did he inflict any\r\nsignificant loss upon his antagonist or hinder his advance.  The\r\nmilitia were, in fact, almost useless in the open field, and only dared\r\nlinger before the oncoming redcoats when intrenched or when behind\r\nwalls and fences.  Many of them from New England grew discouraged and\r\nhomesick, and left the moment their short enlistments expired; so that\r\nwithout any serious battles Washington's so-called army dwindled week\r\nby week.  On November 16, a severe loss was incurred through the effort\r\nof General Greene to hold Fort Washington, which commanded the Hudson\r\nRiver from the heights at the northern end of Manhattan Island.  This\r\nstronghold, besieged by Howe, made a fair defence, but was taken by\r\nstorm, and the whole garrison captured.  The American army then, in two\r\ndetachments under Washington and Lee respectively, was obliged to\r\nretreat across New Jersey, followed by the British under Cornwallis,\r\nuntil, by December 8, the remnant was at Philadelphia in a state of\r\ngreat discouragement and demoralization.  The Continental Congress,\r\nfearing capture, fled to Baltimore and, moved to {85} desperate\r\nmeasures, passed a resolution, giving Washington for six months\r\nunlimited authority to raise recruits, appoint and dismiss officers,\r\nimpress provisions, and arrest loyalists.  Howe felt that the rebellion\r\nwas at an end.  On November 30 he issued a proclamation offering pardon\r\nto all who would take the oath of allegiance within sixty days; and\r\nfarmers in New Jersey took it by hundreds, securing in return a\r\ncertificate of loyalty.  The rebels' cause seemed lost.  But at the\r\nmoment when, if ever, it was worth while to push pursuit to the\r\nuttermost, with the prospect of reducing three colonies and breaking up\r\nall show of resistance, Howe, satisfied with his campaign, began to\r\nprepare winter quarters.\r\n\r\nTo the northward, a similar fatality seemed to prevent full British\r\nsuccess.  During the summer, General Guy Carleton waited at the\r\nnorthern end of Lake Champlain while his carpenters built gunboats.\r\nMonth after month went by until, on October 11, the British vessels\r\nengaged Arnold's inferior flotilla.  Two days of hot fighting with\r\nmusketry and cannon resulted in the destruction of the American\r\nsquadron, so that the way seemed clear for Carleton to advance; but the\r\nseason was late, the difficulties of getting provisions from Canada\r\nseemed excessive, and on November 2 the British {86} withdrew.  Here\r\nagain only extreme caution and slowness permitted the colonial army to\r\nhold its ground.  Yet it seemed doubtful whether the American cause\r\nmight not collapse even without further pressure, for the \"armies\" were\r\nalmost gone by sheer disintegration.  General Schuyler had a scanty\r\n3,000 near Lake Champlain; Washington could not muster over 6,000 at\r\nPhiladelphia, and these were on the points of going home.  The attempt\r\nto carry on the war by voluntary militia fighting was a visible failure.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the darkest hour, Washington, who had never dared to\r\nrisk a battle, took the bold step of re-crossing the Delaware with part\r\nof his half-starved and shivering troops, and captured nearly all of a\r\nHessian encampment at Trenton on December 25.  Further, he drew on\r\nCornwallis to advance against him, skirmished successfully on January\r\n2, and then, moving by a night march to the British rear, defeated a\r\nregiment at Princeton.  Cornwallis, with 7,000 men, was out-generalled\r\nby Washington in this affair, which was the first really aggressive\r\nblow struck by the Americans.  The result was to lead Howe to abandon\r\nthe effort to hold all of New Jersey; while Washington was able to post\r\nhis men in winter quarters at Morristown, where he could watch every\r\nBritish move.  This masterly {87} little campaign, carried on under\r\nevery disadvantage, made Washington's fame secure, and undoubtedly\r\nsaved the American revolution from breaking down.  It revived the\r\nfighting spirit, encouraged the Congress and the people, and created a\r\nfaith in Washington on the part of the soldiers and farmers which was\r\ndestined to grow steadily into love and veneration.  With no particular\r\nmilitary insight beyond common sense and the comprehension of military\r\nvirtues, he was a man of iron will, extreme personal courage, and a\r\npatience and tenacity which had no limit.\r\n\r\nCongress now showed that its members realized in part the military\r\nlesson, for it authorized a standing regular army, and gave Washington\r\npower to establish it and appoint lower officers.  It was a hard task\r\nto induce any Americans to enlist in such an organization; but little\r\nby little there were collected \"Continental troops\" who did not rush\r\nback to their family duties at the end of three months, but stayed and\r\ngrew in discipline and steadiness.  Yet Washington could never count on\r\nmore than a few thousand such; Americans in general simply would not\r\nfight except under pressure of invasion and in defence of their homes.\r\n\r\nDuring 1776-7, the revolted communities assumed something of the\r\nappearance of settled governments.  The States replaced {88} their\r\nrevolutionary conventions with constitutions closely modelled upon\r\ntheir provincial institutions, but with elective governors, and, to\r\nsafeguard liberty, full control over legislation, taxation, and most\r\noffices placed in the hands of the legislatures.  Executive power was\r\nconfined mainly to military matters.  The Continental Congress\r\ncontinued to act as a grand committee of safety, framing\r\nrecommendations and requests to the States, and issuing paper money on\r\nthe credit of its constituents.  Military administration proved a task\r\nbeyond the capacity of the new governments, even for such diminutive\r\narmies as those which guarded the northern frontier and New Jersey, and\r\nthe forces suffered from lack of food, covering, and powder.  The\r\ncountry had few sources of supplies and wretched roads.\r\n\r\nIn 1777, when spring opened, the British armies slowly prepared to push\r\nmatters to a definite conclusion.  The North Cabinet, especially Lord\r\nGeorge Germaine, had no single coherent plan of operations beyond\r\ncontinuing the lines laid down in 1776.  It was early planned to have\r\nthe Canadian force march southward and join Howe, collecting supplies\r\nand gathering recruits as it traversed New York.  Howe was told that he\r\nwas expected to co-operate, but was not prevented from substituting a\r\nplan of his {89} own which involved capturing Philadelphia, the chief\r\nAmerican town and, as the seat of the Continental Congress, the \"rebel\r\ncapital.\"  Germaine merely intimated that Howe ought to make such\r\nspeedy work as to return in time to meet the Canadian force, but did\r\nnot give him any positive order, so Howe considered his plan approved.\r\nIn leisurely fashion he tried twice to march across New Jersey in June;\r\nbut, although he had 17,000 to Washington's 8,000, he would not risk\r\nleaving the latter in his rear and withdrew.  He next determined to\r\nmove by water, and began the sea journey on July 5.  This process\r\noccupied not less than six weeks, since he first tried to sail up the\r\nDelaware, only to withdraw from before the American forts; and it was\r\nnot until August 22 that he finally landed his men at the head of\r\nChesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Burgoyne, a man of fashion as well as an officer,\r\nhad begun his march southward from Lake Champlain with 7,500 men and\r\nsome Indian allies, forced the Americans to evacuate Fort Ticonderoga\r\nwithout a blow, and chased the garrison to the southward and eastward.\r\nPushing forward in spite of blocked roads and burned bridges, he\r\nreached the Hudson River on August 1 without mishap, and there halted\r\nto collect provisions and await {90} reinforcements from Tories and\r\nfrom a converging expedition under St. Leger, which was to join him by\r\nway of Lake Ontario and the Mohawk Valley.  Up to this time the\r\nAmerican defence had been futile.  It seemed as though nothing could\r\nstop Burgoyne's advance.  Congress now appointed a new general, Gates,\r\nto whom Washington sent General Morgan with some of his best troops.\r\nWhile Burgoyne waited, the militia of New England began collecting, and\r\npresently, on August 15 and 16, two detachments of the British sent to\r\nseize stores at Bennington were surrounded and captured.  St. Leger,\r\nunable to manage his Indian allies, or force the surrender of the\r\nAmerican Fort Stanwix, was obliged, on August 22, to retreat.\r\nBurgoyne, with diminishing numbers and no hope of reinforcement, found\r\nhimself confronted by rapidly growing swarms of enemies.  At the moment\r\nwhen his need of co-operation from Howe became acute, the latter\r\ngeneral was two hundred miles away in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, the two campaigns worked themselves out to\r\nindependent conclusions.  In Pennsylvania, Washington boldly marched\r\nhis summer army with its nucleous of veterans out to meet the British,\r\nand challenged a battle along the banks of the Brandywine creek.  On\r\nSeptember 11, Howe, with 18,000 men, methodically attacked {91}\r\nWashington, who had not over 11,000, sent a flanking column around his\r\nright wing, and after a stiff resistance pushed the Americans from the\r\nfield.  There was no pursuit; and four days later Washington was\r\nprevented only by bad weather from risking another fight.  He did not\r\nfeel able to prevent Howe from entering Philadelphia on September 27;\r\nbut on October 3, taking advantage of a division of the British army,\r\nhe assumed the offensive at Germantown and brought his unsteady forces\r\ninto action, only to suffer another defeat.  With this Washington was\r\nforced to abandon operations in the field and to go into winter\r\nquarters at Valley Forge, not far from the city; while Howe besieged\r\nand on November 2 took the American forts on the Delaware.  The British\r\ncampaign was successful; Philadelphia was theirs, and they had won\r\nevery engagement.  But nothing shows more clearly Washington's ability\r\nas a fighter and leader than his stubborn contest against odds in this\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Northern campaign came to its conclusion.  By September,\r\nGates, the new commander, found himself at the head of nearly 20,000\r\nmen, and Burgoyne's case grew desperate.  He made two efforts to break\r\nthrough to the southward, at Freeman's Farm, and again at Bemis\r\nHeights, but was {92} met by superior numbers and overwhelmed, in spite\r\nof the gallantry of his troops.  Forced back to Saratoga on the Hudson\r\nRiver, he was surrounded and at length compelled to surrender, on\r\nOctober 17.  Sir Henry Clinton, who commanded the British garrison of\r\nNew York in Howe's absence, sent a small expedition up the Hudson; but\r\nit did not penetrate nearer than sixty miles from the spot where\r\nBurgoyne stood at bay, and it achieved nothing more than a raid.  So\r\nthe northern British force, sent to perform an impossible task, was\r\ndestroyed solely because neither Howe nor his superiors realized the\r\nnecessity of providing for certain co-operation from the southward.\r\nThe prisoners, according to the terms of the surrender, were to be\r\nreturned to England; but Congress, owing in part to some complaints of\r\nBurgoyne, chose to violate the agreement, and the captive British and\r\nHessians were retained.  Burgoyne himself returned to England, burning\r\nwith anger against Howe and the North Ministry.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1777-8 found the two British armies comfortably housed in\r\nNew York and Philadelphia, and Washington, with his handful of\r\nmiserably equipped men, presenting the skeleton of an army at Valley\r\nForge.  Congress, now manned by less able leaders than at first, was\r\nalmost won over to {93} displacing the unsuccessful commander by Gates,\r\nthe victor of Saratoga; and it did go so far as to commit the\r\nadministration of the army to a cabal of Gates's friends, who carried\r\non a campaign of depreciation and backbiting against Washington.  But\r\nthe whole unworthy plot broke down under a few vigorous words from the\r\nlatter, the would-be rival quailing before the Virginian's personal\r\nauthority.  He was not a safe man to bait.  The military headship\r\nremained securely with the one general capable of holding things\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1778, however, a new element entered the game, namely,\r\nthe possibility of French intervention.  From the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution, very many Americans saw that their former deadly enemy,\r\nFrance, would be likely to prove an ally against England; and as early\r\nas 1776 American emissaries began to sound the court of Versailles.  In\r\nMarch, 1776, Silas Deane was regularly commissioned by the Continental\r\nCongress, and in the autumn he was followed by no less a person than\r\nBenjamin Franklin.  It was the duty of these men to get whatever aid\r\nthey could, especially to seek an alliance.  The young king, Louis XVI,\r\nwas not a man of any independent statecraft; but his ministers, above\r\nall Vergennes, in charge of foreign affairs, were anxious to secure\r\nrevenge {94} upon England for the damage done by Pitt, and the tone of\r\nthe French court was emphatically warlike.  The financial weakness of\r\nthe French government, destined shortly to pave the way for the\r\nRevolution, was clearly visible to Turgot, the Minister of Finances,\r\nand he with a few others protested against the expense of a foreign\r\nwar; but Vergennes carried the day.\r\n\r\nAs early as the summer of 1776, French arms and munitions were being\r\nsecretly supplied, while the Foreign Minister solemnly assured the\r\nwatchful Lord Stormont, the English Ambassador, of his government's\r\nperfect neutrality.  Thousands of muskets, hundreds of cannon, and\r\nquantities of clothes were thus shipped, and sums of money were also\r\nturned over to Franklin.  Beaumarchais, the playwright and adventurer,\r\nacted with gusto the part of intermediary; and the lords and ladies of\r\nthe French court, amusing themselves with \"philosophy\" and speculative\r\nliberalism, made a pet of the witty and sagacious Franklin.  His\r\npopularity actually rivalled that of Voltaire when the latter, in 1778,\r\nreturned to see Paris and die.  But not until the colonies had proved\r\nthat they could meet the English in battle with some prospect of\r\nsuccess would the French commit themselves openly; and during 1776 and\r\n1777 the tide ran too steadily against {95} the insurgents.  Finally,\r\nin December, when the anxieties of Franklin and his associates were\r\nalmost unendurable, the news of Burgoyne's surrender was brought to\r\nParis.  The turning-point was reached.  Vergennes immediately led the\r\nFrench King to make two treaties, one for commercial reciprocity, the\r\nother a treaty of military alliance, recognizing the independence of\r\nthe United States, and pledging the countries to make no separate\r\npeace.  In the spring of 1778 the news reached America; and the war now\r\nentered upon a second stage.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that under abler commanders the British\r\narmies might have crushed out all armed resistance in the middle\r\ncolonies.  In spite of all drawbacks, the trained British soldiers and\r\nofficers were so superior in the field to the American levies on every\r\noccasion where the forces were not overwhelmingly unequal that it is\r\nimpossible for any but the most bigoted American partisan to deny this\r\npossibility.  Had there been a blockade, so that French and Dutch goods\r\nwould have been excluded; had General Howe possessed the faintest spark\r\nof energy in following up his successes; had the North Cabinet not\r\nfailed to compel Howe to co-operate with Burgoyne, the condition of\r\nthings in 1778 might well have been so serious for the colonists' cause\r\nthat {96} Vergennes would have felt a French intervention to be\r\nfruitless.  In that case, it is hard to see how the rebellion could\r\nhave failed to be crushed in the next year.  As it was, the Americans,\r\nby luck and by the tenacity of Washington and a few other leaders, had\r\nwon the first victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFRENCH INTERVENTION AND BRITISH FAILURE, 1778-1781\r\n\r\nDuring the two years of fighting, the party situation in England had\r\ngrown increasingly bitter.  The Whigs, joined now by young Charles Fox,\r\nunremittingly denounced the war as a crime, sympathized with the\r\nrebels, and execrated the cruelty of the Ministers while deriding their\r\nabilities.  Parliament rang with vituperation; personal insults flew\r\nback and forth.  From time to time Chatham took part in the attack,\r\njoining Burke and Fox in an opposition never surpassed for oratorical\r\npower.  But the Ministerial party, secure in its strength, pushed on\r\nits way.  The King now regarded the war as the issue {97} upon which he\r\nhad staked his personal honour, and would tolerate no faltering.  Yet\r\nin the winter of 1778 the rumours of a French alliance thickened; and,\r\nwhen the probability seemed to be a certainty, North made a desperate\r\neffort to end the war through a policy of granting everything except\r\nindependence.  In a speech of incredible assurance, he observed that he\r\nhad never favoured trying to tax America, and brought in a Bill by\r\nwhich every parliamentary measure complained of by the Americans was\r\nrepealed, and the right of internal taxation was expressly renounced.\r\nAmid the dejection of the Tories and the sneers of the Whigs, this\r\nmeasure became law, March 2, 1778; and commissioners, empowered to\r\ngrant general amnesty, were sent with it to the United States.\r\n\r\nAt no other time in English history would it have been possible for a\r\nMinistry thus utterly to reverse its policy and remain in office; but\r\nNorth's tenure depended on influences outside the House of Commons, and\r\nhe continued in his place.  So severe was the crisis that an effort was\r\nmade to arrange a coalition Ministry, with the aged Chatham at its\r\nhead; George III, however, positively refused to permit North to\r\nsurrender the first place.  He would consent to Whigs entering the\r\nCabinet only in subordinate positions.  This {98} obstinacy and the\r\nsudden death of Chatham blocked all coalition proposals, and left the\r\nwar to continue as a party measure, not national in its character--the\r\n\"King's war.\"\r\n\r\nIn America, the task of the commissioners proved hopeless.  The men now\r\nin control of the Continental Congress and the State governments were\r\npledged to independence from the bottom of their souls; and in the\r\ncourse of months of appeals, and attempts at negotiations, the\r\ncommissioners failed to secure even a hearing.  Congress ratified the\r\nFrench treaties with enthusiasm.  That their proposal if made before\r\nthe Declaration would have been successful can scarcely be doubted.  It\r\nmight even have produced an effect after 1776 had it been made by a\r\nWhig Ministry, headed by Chatham.  But coming in 1778, after three\r\nyears of war, when every vestige of the former sentiment of loyalty was\r\ndead, and offered by the same North Ministry which had brought on the\r\nrevolution, it was foredoomed to defeat.\r\n\r\nThe war now entered upon a second phase, in which England found itself\r\nharder pressed than at any time in its history.  It had not an ally in\r\nthe world, and could count on no Rhine campaigns to exhaust French\r\nresources.  For the first time England engaged France in a purely naval\r\nwar; and for the only time France was sufficiently strong in\r\nsail-of-the-line {99} to meet England on equal terms.  The French\r\nfleet, rebuilt since 1763, was in excellent condition; the British\r\nnavy, on the contrary, under the slack administration of Lord Sandwich,\r\nwas worse off in equipment, repairs, number of sailors, and _esprit de\r\ncorps_ than at any time in the century.  The French were able to send\r\nfleets unhindered wherever they wished; and when Spain entered as an\r\nally, in 1779, their combined navies swept the Channel, driving the\r\nhumiliated British fleet into port.  England was called upon to make\r\ndefensive war at home, at Gibraltar, in the West Indies, and finally in\r\nIndia, at a time when the full strength of the country was already\r\noccupied with the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis led to an alteration of military methods in America.  The policy\r\nof moving heavy armies was abandoned; and the British, forced to\r\nwithdraw troops to garrison the West Indies and Florida, began the\r\npractice of wearing down the revolted colonies by raids and destruction\r\nof property.  George III especially approved this punitive policy.  As\r\na first step, the army in Philadelphia marched back to New York,\r\nattacked on its retreat by Washington at Monmouth on June 27, 1778.\r\nThe American advance was badly handled by General Lee, and fell back\r\nbefore the British; but Washington in person rallied his men, resumed\r\nthe attack, and held his position.  {100} Clinton, who succeeded Howe,\r\ncontinued his march, and the British army now settled down in New York,\r\nnot to depart from its safe protection except on raids.\r\n\r\nWashington accordingly posted his forces, as in 1777, outside the city,\r\nand awaited events.  He could assume the offensive only in case a\r\nFrench fleet should assist him, and this happened but twice, in 1778,\r\nand not again for three years.  The first time, Admiral D'Estaing with\r\na strong fleet menaced New York and then Newport, the latter in\r\nconjunction with an American land force.  But before each port he was\r\nfoiled by the superior skill of Admiral Howe; and he finally withdrew\r\nwithout risking a battle, to the intense disgust of the Americans.  For\r\nthe rest, the war in the northern States dwindled to raids by the\r\nBritish along the Connecticut coast and into New Jersey, and outpost\r\naffairs on the Hudson, in some of which Washington's Continental troops\r\nshowed real brilliancy in attack.  But with the British in command of\r\nthe sea little could be done to meet the raids, and southern\r\nConnecticut was ravaged with fire and sword.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the States suffered the horrors of Indian war, since\r\nthe Tories and British from Canada utilized the Iroquois and the Ohio\r\nValley Indians as allies.  The New York frontier was in continual\r\ndistress; {101} and the Pennsylvania and Maryland and Virginia\r\nsettlements felt the scalping knife and torch.  Hamilton, the British\r\ncommander at the post of Detroit, paid a fixed price for scalps, and\r\nwas known as \"the hair buyer.\"  Against the Iroquois, Sullivan led an\r\nexpedition in 1779 which could not bring the savages to a decisive\r\nbattle, although he ravaged their lands and crippled their resources.\r\nAgainst the north-western Indians, a daring Virginian, George Rogers\r\nClark, led a counter-raid which captured several posts in the territory\r\nnorth of the Ohio River, and finally took Hamilton himself prisoner at\r\nVincennes.  In every such war the sufferings of the settlers\r\noutnumbered a hundred-fold all that they could inflict in return, and\r\nthis consciousness burned into their souls a lasting hatred of England,\r\nthe ally of the murdering, torturing devils from the forests.\r\n\r\nWhile the British fleets fought indecisive actions in European waters,\r\nor near the West Indies, the British raiding policy was transferred to\r\na new region, namely, the southern States, which thus far had known\r\nlittle of the severities of war.  In December, 1778, an expedition\r\nunder Prevost easily occupied Savannah, driving the Georgia militia\r\naway.  The next year an effort was made by an American force, in\r\ncombination with the French fleet under D'Estaing, who returned from\r\n{102} the West Indies, to recapture the place.  The siege was formed,\r\nand there appeared some prospects of a successful outcome, but the\r\nFrench admiral, too restless to wait until the completion of siege\r\noperations, insisted on trying to take the city by storm on October 9.\r\nThe result was a complete repulse, after which D'Estaing sailed away,\r\nand the American besiegers were obliged to withdraw.  The real\r\ninterests of the French were, in fact, in the West Indies, where they\r\nwere gradually capturing English islands; their contributions so far to\r\nthe American cause consisted in gifts of munitions and loans of money,\r\ntogether with numerous adventurous officers who aspired to lead the\r\nAmerican armies.  The most amiable and attractive of these was the\r\nyoung Marquis de Lafayette, owing largely to whose influence a force of\r\nFrench soldiers under de Rochambeau was sent in 1780 to America.  But\r\nfor months this force was able to do no more than remain in camp at\r\nNewport, Rhode Island, blockaded by the English fleet.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, the British raiding policy was resumed in the southern States\r\nand achieved a startling success.  In January, Clinton sailed from New\r\nYork with a force of 8,000 men, and after driving the American levies\r\ninto the city of Charleston, South Carolina, besieged and took it on\r\nMay 12, with all its {103} defenders.  He then returned to New York,\r\nleaving Lord Cornwallis with a few troops to complete the conquest of\r\nthe State.  Congress now sent General Gates southward to repeat the\r\ntriumph of Saratoga.  At Camden, on August 16, 1780, the issue was\r\ndecided.  The American commander, with only 3,000 men, encountered\r\nCornwallis, who had about 2,200, and, as usual, the militia, when\r\nattacked by British in the open field, fled for their lives at the\r\nfirst charge of the redcoats, leaving the few continentals to be\r\noutnumbered and crushed.\r\n\r\nFor a period of several weeks all organized American resistance\r\ndisappeared.  Only bands of guerillas, or \"partisans,\" as they were\r\ncalled, kept the field.  Clinton had issued a proclamation calling all\r\nloyalists to join the ranks; and Cornwallis made a systematic effort to\r\ncompel the enrolment of Tory militia.  The plan bore fruit in an\r\napparent large increase of British numbers, but also in the outbreak of\r\na murderous civil war.  Raiding parties on both sides took to\r\nambuscades, nocturnal house-burning, hanging of prisoners, and\r\ndownright massacres.  Pre-eminent for his success was the British\r\nColonel Tarleton, who with a body of light troops swept tirelessly\r\naround, breaking up rebel bands, riding down militia, and rendering his\r\ncommand a terror to the {104} State.  Marion, Sumter, and other\r\nAmericans struggled vainly to equal his exploits.\r\n\r\nOccasional American successes could not turn back the tide.  On October\r\n18, 1780, a band of Tories under General Ferguson ventured too far to\r\nthe westward, and at King's Mountain were surrounded and shot or taken\r\nprisoners by a general uprising of the frontiersmen.  General Greene,\r\nwho replaced Gates in December, managed to rally a few men, but dared\r\nnot meet Cornwallis in the field.  His lieutenant, Morgan, when pursued\r\nby Tarleton, turned on him at the Cowpens, and on January 17 managed to\r\ninflict a severe defeat.  The forces were diminutive--less than a\r\nthousand on each side--but the battle was skilfully fought.  After it,\r\nhowever, both Morgan and Greene were forced to fly northward, and did\r\nnot escape Cornwallis's pursuit until they were driven out of North\r\nCarolina.  The State seemed lost, and on February 23, Cornwallis issued\r\na proclamation calling upon all loyalists to join the royal forces.\r\nMeanwhile, encouraged by the striking successes in the Carolinas,\r\nClinton sent a force under Arnold to Virginia, which marched unopposed\r\nthrough the seaboard counties of that State in the winter of 1781.  It\r\nseemed as though the new British policy were on the verge of a great\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n{105}\r\n\r\nBy this time it was becoming a grave question whether the American\r\nrevolution was not going to collapse from sheer weakness.  The\r\nconfederation, as a general government, seemed to be on the verge of\r\nbreaking down.  The State governments, although badly hampered wherever\r\nBritish raids took place, were operating regularly and steadily, but\r\nthe only common government continued to be the voluntary Continental\r\nCongress, whose powers were entirely undefined, and rested, in fact, on\r\nsufferance.  In 1776 a committee, headed by John Dickinson, drafted\r\nArticles of Confederation which, if adopted promptly, would have\r\nprovided a regular form of government; but, although these were\r\nsubmitted in 1777 for ratification, inter-state jealousy sufficed to\r\nblock their acceptance.  It was discovered that all those States which,\r\nby their original charters, were given no definite western boundaries,\r\nwere disposed to claim an extension of their territory to the\r\nMississippi River.  Virginia, through her general, Clark, actually\r\noccupied part of the region claimed by her, and assumed to grant lands\r\nthere.  The representatives of Maryland in Congress declared such\r\ninequality a danger to the union, and refused to sign the Articles\r\nunless the land claims west of the mountains were surrendered to the\r\ngeneral government.  {106} This determination was formally approved by\r\nthe Maryland legislature in February, 1779, and matters remained at a\r\nstandstill.  At last, in 1780, Congress offered to hold any lands which\r\nmight be granted to it, with the pledge to form them into States, and,\r\nfollowing this, New York, and Virginia intimated a willingness to make\r\nthe required cessions.  Then Maryland yielded and ratified the\r\nArticles, so that they came into operation on March 2, 1781.\r\n\r\nThe self-styled \"United States\" had now travelled so far on the road to\r\nbankruptcy that the adoption of the \"Articles of Perpetual Union\"\r\nseemed scarcely more than an empty form.  In the first place, the\r\nfederal finances were prostrate.  The device of issuing paper money had\r\nproved fatal, for, after a brief period, in 1775, the excessive issues\r\ndepreciated in spite of every effort to hinder their decline by\r\nproclamations, price conventions, and political pressure.  The only way\r\nof sustaining such notes, namely, the furnishing by the States of a\r\nfull and sufficient revenue, was never attempted; for the States\r\nthemselves preferred to issue notes, rather than to tax, and when\r\ncalled upon by the Continental Congress for requisitions they turned\r\nover such amounts of paper as they saw fit.  By 1780, the \"continental\r\ncurrency\" was {107} practically worthless.  Congress could rely only\r\nupon such small sums of money as it could raise by foreign loans\r\nthrough Franklin and by the contributions of a few patriotic people,\r\nnotably Robert Morris.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the army exhausted the resources of Congress, and\r\nevery winter saw the story of Valley Forge repeated.  To secure\r\nsupplies, Congress was driven to authorize seizure and impressment of\r\nfood and payment in certificates of indebtedness.  It was for this\r\nreason, as well as from the unwillingness of the Americans to enlist\r\nfor the war, that the Continental forces dwindled to diminutive numbers\r\nin 1781.  Nothing but Washington's tireless tenacity and loyalty held\r\nthe army together, and kept the officers from resigning in disgust.\r\nYet it seemed impossible that Washington himself could carry the burden\r\nmuch longer.  The general government appeared to be on the point of\r\ndisintegrating, leaving to the separate States the task of defending\r\nthemselves.  Everywhere lassitude, preoccupation with local matters, a\r\ndisposition to leave the war to the French, a willingness to let other\r\nStates bear the burdens, replaced the fervour of 1776.  In other words,\r\nthe old colonial habits were reasserting themselves, and the separate\r\nStates, reverting to their former accustomed negative politics, were\r\n{108} behaving toward the Continental Congress precisely as they had\r\ndone toward England itself during the French wars.  With hundreds of\r\nthousands of men of fighting age in America it was impossible, in 1781,\r\nto collect more than a handful for service away from their homes.  The\r\nessentially unmilitary nature of the Americans was not to be changed.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the rebels, the policy of Great Britain was such as to\r\ngive them a lease of hope.  In spite of the great British naval power\r\nduring the first two years of the war, no blockade had been attempted;\r\nand after 1778 the British fleets were thoroughly occupied in following\r\nand foiling the French.  The result was that commerce of a sort\r\ncontinued throughout the war, armed privateers and merchantmen\r\nventuring from the New England and other ports, and trading with\r\nFrance, Spain and the West Indies.  Hundreds were taken by British\r\ncruisers, but hundreds more continued their dangerous trade, and so\r\nAmerica continued to receive imports.  The Dutch, especially, supplied\r\nthe revolted colonies with some of the commodities which their\r\nexclusion from British ports rendered scarce.  So, except for paper\r\nmoney, there was no economic distress.\r\n\r\nIn 1781, when if ever the British might hope to reduce the colonies,\r\nthe Empire was itself in sore straits for men to fill its ships and\r\n{109} garrison its forts.  This made it difficult for England to send\r\nany reinforcements to America, and left Clinton and Cornwallis with\r\nabout 27,000 men to complete their raiding campaign.  The task proved\r\nexcessive.  In March, 1781, Greene, having assembled a small force,\r\ngave battle to Cornwallis at Guilford Court House.  The little army of\r\nBritish veterans, only 2,219 in all, drove Greene from the field after\r\na stiff fight, but were so reduced in numbers that Cornwallis felt\r\nobliged to retreat to Wilmington on the coast, where he was entirely\r\nout of the field of campaign.  On April 25 he marched northward into\r\nVirginia to join the force which had been there for several months,\r\ntook command, and continued the policy of marching and destroying.\r\nBefore his arrival, Washington had tried to use the French force at\r\nNewport against the Virginia raiders; but the French squadron, although\r\nit ventured from port in March, 1781, and had a successful encounter\r\nwith a British fleet, declined to push on into the Chesapeake, and the\r\nplan was abandoned.  Cornwallis was able to march unhindered by any\r\nFrench danger during the summer of 1781.\r\n\r\nBut while the British were terrifying Virginia and chasing militia, the\r\nforces left in the Carolinas were being worn down by {110} Greene and\r\nhis \"partisan\" allies.  On April 25, at Hobkirk's Hill, Rawdon, the\r\nBritish commander defeated Greene, and then, with reduced ranks,\r\nretreated.  During the summer, further sieges and raids recaptured\r\nBritish posts, and on September 8 another battle took place at Eutaw\r\nSprings.  This resulted, as usual, in a British success on the\r\nbattlefield and a retreat afterwards.  By October, the slender British\r\nforces in the southernmost States were cooped up in Charleston and\r\nSavannah, and a war of extermination was stamping out all organized\r\nTory resistance.  The raiding policy had failed through weakness of\r\nnumbers.  The superior fighting ability and tactical skill of\r\nCornwallis, Rawdon, Stuart, and Tarleton were as obvious as the courage\r\nand steadiness of their troops; but their means were pitifully\r\ninadequate to the task assigned them.\r\n\r\nFurther north, a still greater failure took place.  Washington was not\r\ndeterred by the futile outcome of his previous attempts to use French\r\nco-operation from making a patient and urgent effort to induce De\r\nGrasse, the French admiral in the West Indies, to come north and join\r\nwith him and Rochambeau in an attack on Cornwallis in Virginia.  He was\r\nat last successful; and on August 28 the wished-for fleet, {111} a\r\npowerful collection of twenty-eight sail-of-the-line, with frigates,\r\nreached Chesapeake Bay.  Already the French troops from Newport, and\r\npart of the American army from outside New York, had begun their\r\nsouthward march, carefully concealing their purposes from Clinton, and\r\nwere moving through Pennsylvania.  As a third part of the combination,\r\nthe French squadron from Newport put to sea, bringing eight more\r\nsail-of-the-line, which, added to De Grasse's, would overmatch any\r\nBritish fleet on the western side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe one disturbing possibility was that the British West India fleet,\r\nwhich very properly had sailed in pursuit, might defeat the two French\r\nfleets singly.  This chance was put to the test on September 5.  On\r\nthat day Admiral Graves, with nineteen men-of-war, attacked De Grasse,\r\nwho brought twenty-four into line outside Chesapeake Bay; and the\r\ndecisive action of the Revolution took place.  Seldom has a greater\r\nstake been played for by a British fleet, and seldom has a naval battle\r\nbeen less successfully managed.  Graves may have intended to\r\nconcentrate upon part of the French line, but his subordinates\r\ncertainly failed to understand any such purpose; and the outcome was\r\nthat the head of the British column, approaching the French line at\r\n{112} an angle, was severely handled, while the rear took no part in\r\nthe battle.  The fleets separated without decisive result, and the\r\nBritish, after cruising a few days irresolutely, gave up and returned\r\nto New York.  The other French squadron had meanwhile arrived, and the\r\nallied troops had come down the Chesapeake.  Cornwallis, shut up in\r\nYorktown by overwhelming forces, defended himself until October 17, and\r\nthen surrendered with 8,000 men to the man who had beaten him years\r\nbefore at Trenton and Princeton.  Clinton, aware at last of his danger,\r\nsailed with every vessel he could scrape together, and approached the\r\nbay on October 24 with twenty-five sail-of-the-line and 7,000 men; but\r\nit was too late.  He could only retreat to New York, where he remained\r\nin the sole British foothold north of Charleston and Savannah.\r\n\r\nWashington would have been glad to retain De Grasse and undertake\r\nfurther combined manoeuvres; but the French admiral was anxious to\r\nreturn to the West Indies, and so the military operations of the year\r\nended.  More was in reality unnecessary, for the collapse of the\r\nBritish military policy was manifest, and the surrender of Cornwallis\r\nwas a sufficiently striking event to bring the war to a close.\r\nWashington had not won the last fight with his own {113} Continentals.\r\nThe co-operation not only of the French fleet but of the French troops\r\nunder Rochambeau had played the decisive part.  Yet it was his\r\nplanning, his tenacity, his personal authority with French and\r\nAmericans that determined the combined operation and made it\r\nsuccessful.  In the midst of a half-starved, ill-equipped army, a\r\ndisintegrating, bankrupt government, and a people whose fighting spirit\r\nwas rapidly dwindling, it was he with his officers who had saved the\r\nRevolution at the last gasp.\r\n\r\nIt was no less the British mismanagement which made this possible, for\r\nhad not Howe, by delays, thrown away his chances; had not Howe and\r\nBurgoyne and Clinton and Cornwallis, by their failures to co-operate,\r\nmade it possible for their armies to be taken separately; had not the\r\nnavy omitted to apply a blockade; had not the Ministry, in prescribing\r\na raiding policy, failed to strain every nerve to furnish an adequate\r\nsupply of men, the outcome would have been different.  As it was, the\r\nBritish defeat could no longer be concealed by the end of 1781.  The\r\nattempt to conquer America had failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{114}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBRITISH PARTIES AND AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, 1778-1783\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown reached\r\nEngland, it was recognized by Whigs and Tories alike that the time had\r\ncome to admit the failure of the war.  The loss of 7,000 troops was not\r\nin itself a severe blow, at a time when England had over 200,000 men\r\nunder arms in various parts of the world; but it actually marked the\r\nbreakdown of the American campaign, and, what was still more\r\nsignificant, the political bankruptcy of the North Ministry.  Ever\r\nsince 1778, the tide had been rising against the royal policy.  At\r\nfirst, when the French war began, the nation rallied against the\r\nancient foe and there was some enthusiasm displayed in recruiting and\r\nfurnishing supplies; but, as general after general returned from\r\nAmerica--first Burgoyne, then Howe and his brother, the admiral,--to\r\nrise in Parliament and denounce the administrative incompetence which\r\nhad foiled their efforts; as month after month passed and no victory\r\neither in America or Europe came to cheer the public; worst of all,\r\nwhen, in 1779, and again in 1780, combined French and Spanish fleets\r\nswept the Channel {115} in overpowering numbers, driving the English\r\nfleet into Torbay harbour--the war spirit dwindled, and bitter\r\ncriticism took its place.\r\n\r\nThe Whig Opposition, no longer hampered by having the defence of the\r\nrevolted colonists as their sole issue, denounced in unmeasured\r\nlanguage the incompetence, corruption, and despotism of the North\r\nMinistry, singling out Sandwich, at the Admiralty, and Germaine,\r\nSecretary for the Colonies, as objects for especial invective.  Party\r\nhatred festered in army and navy, Whig and Tory admirals distrusting\r\neach other and engaging in bitter quarrels, Whig and Tory generals\r\ncriticizing one another's plans and motives.  On his part, Lord North\r\nfelt, as early as 1779, that his task was hopeless, and sought\r\nrepeatedly to resign; but in spite of secessions from the Ministry, in\r\nspite of defeats and humiliations such as the control by the allies of\r\nthe Channel, nothing could shake George's determination.  He would\r\nnever consent to abandon the colonies or permit North to surrender to\r\nthe detested Whigs.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, the Opposition, led by Fox and Burke, began to direct its fire\r\nat the King himself; and finally, in March of that year, they had the\r\nsatisfaction of carrying in the Commons, by votes of men who once had\r\nbeen on the administration side, a resolution to the effect that \"the\r\npower of the Crown {116} has increased, is increasing, and ought to be\r\ndiminished.\"  This was carried, by 283 votes to 215, in a House where\r\nfour years before the total Opposition mustered only a hundred.\r\nMeasures to cut down sinecures, to limit the secret service fund, to\r\ntake away opportunities for royal corruption, were introduced by Burke\r\nand, although defeated, drew large votes.\r\n\r\nThe tenacious politician who wore the crown was not yet beaten.  In the\r\nsummer of 1780, the disgraceful Gordon riots broke out in London; and\r\nthe King, by his courageous personal bearing and bold direction of\r\naffairs, won momentary prestige.  The news from America, moreover, was\r\nbrighter than for a long time, and the British defence of Gibraltar was\r\nunshaken.  Suddenly dissolving Parliament, the King employed every\r\nresource of influence or pressure, and managed to secure once more a\r\nmajority in the House of Commons.  During the year 1781, the North\r\nMinistry breathed more freely, and was able to repel Whig attacks by\r\nsafe majorities.  But the respite was short.\r\n\r\nIn the winter session of 1782, the news of Yorktown shook the Ministry\r\nto its centre, and on top of that came the reports of the surrender of\r\nMinorca, St. Kitts, and Nevis.  Held together only by the inflexible\r\ndetermination of George III never to yield American {117} independence\r\nor \"stoop to opposition,\" the Ministers fought bitterly though\r\ndespairingly against a succession of Whig motions, censuring the\r\nAdmiralty, demanding the withdrawal of the troops, and finally\r\ncensuring the Ministry.  Majorities dwindled as rats began to leave the\r\nsinking ship.  On March 8, North escaped censure by ten votes only.\r\nThe King made repeated efforts to induce members of the Opposition to\r\ncome into some sort of coalition, but the hatred was too fierce, the\r\ndivergence of principle too wide.  Rockingham would accept only\r\nabsolute surrender.  On March 15, a resolution of want of confidence\r\nwas lost by nine only.\r\n\r\nFive days later, in face of a renewed motion of the same kind, North\r\nannounced his resignation.  The end had come.  The system of George III\r\nhad broken down, ruined by the weaknesses of the Tory Cabinet in\r\nadministration, in war, and in diplomacy, the most disastrous Ministry\r\nin the history of England.  There was no possible doubt as to the\r\nsignificance of the collapse, for Lord Rockingham took office with a\r\nWhig Cabinet, containing Shelburne and Fox, steadfast friends of\r\nAmerica, as Secretaries of State, and with the avowed purpose of\r\nconceding independence to the former colonies, while maintaining the\r\ncontest with Spain and France.\r\n\r\n{118}\r\n\r\nInterest now shifted from the battlefield to the regions of diplomacy,\r\nwhere the situation was complicated and delicate, owing to the unusual\r\nrelations of the parties involved.  The United States and France were\r\nin alliance, each pledged not to make a separate peace.  Spain was in\r\nalliance with France for the purpose of recovering Gibraltar, Minorca,\r\nand Florida, but was not in any alliance with the United States.  The\r\nFrench government, tied thus to two allies, recognized the possible\r\ncontingency of diverging interests between Spain and the United States,\r\nand exerted all the influence it could to keep diplomatic control in\r\nits own hands.  This it accomplished through its representatives in\r\nAmerica, especially de la Luzerne, who wielded an immense prestige with\r\nthe members of the Continental Congress, not only through his position\r\nas representative of the power whose military, naval, and financial aid\r\nwas absolutely indispensable, but also by means of personal intrigues\r\nof a type hitherto more familiar in European courts than in simple\r\nAmerica.  Under his direction, Congress authorized its European\r\nrepresentatives, Franklin, Jay, and Adams, accredited to France, Spain,\r\nand the Netherlands respectively, to act as peace commissioners and to\r\nbe guided in all things by the advice and consent of the French\r\nMinister, {119} Vergennes.  Their instructions designated boundaries,\r\nindemnity for ravages and for the taking of slaves, and a possible\r\ncession of Canada, but all were made subject to French approval.  When,\r\naccordingly, in 1781, both Shelburne and Fox of the Rockingham Ministry\r\nsought to open negotiations with the American representatives, while\r\npushing on vigorously the war against France and Spain, they\r\ninterjected an embarrassing element into the situation.  Vergennes\r\ncould not prohibit American negotiation, but he relied upon the\r\ninstructions of the commissioners to enable him to prevent the making\r\nof any separate peace, contrary to the treaty of 1778.\r\n\r\nThe first steps were taken by Franklin and Shelburne, who opened\r\nunofficial negotiations through Richard Oswald, a friend of America.\r\nIt seems to have been Shelburne's plan to avoid the preliminary\r\nconcession of independence, hoping to retain some form of connection\r\nbetween America and England, or at least to use independence as a\r\nmake-weight in the negotiations.  Hence Oswald, his agent, was not\r\ncommissioned to deal with the United States as such.  Fox, Secretary\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, felt, on the other hand, that the negotiation\r\nbelonged to his field, and he sent Thomas Grenville to Paris,\r\nauthorized to deal with France {120} and, indirectly, with the United\r\nStates.  Over this difference in the Cabinet, and over other matters,\r\nan acute personal rivalry developed between Fox and Shelburne, which\r\nculminated when Rockingham died in July, 1782.  George III, who much\r\npreferred Shelburne to Fox, asked him to form a Ministry, and upon his\r\nacceptance Fox, absolutely refusing to serve under him, withdrew from\r\nthe Cabinet, carrying his friends with him.  Thus the triumphant Whig\r\nparty was split within a few months after its victory.  The whole\r\nresponsibility now rested on Shelburne.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a new situation had developed in Paris, for Jay and Adams,\r\nthe other two commissioners, had brought about a change in the American\r\npolicy.  Franklin, deeply indebted to the French court and on the best\r\nof terms with Vergennes, was willing to credit him with good intentions\r\nand was ready to accept his advice to negotiate with England under the\r\nvague terms of Oswald's commission; but Jay, who had had a mortifying\r\nexperience in Spain, suspected treachery and insisted that England\r\nmust, in opening negotiations, fully recognize American independence.\r\nHe was sure that Spain would gladly see the United States shut in to\r\nthe Atlantic coast away from Spanish territory, and he felt certain\r\n{121} that Vergennes was under Spanish influence.  Adams, who knew\r\nnothing of Spain, but distrusted the French on general principles,\r\nsided with Jay; and Franklin, submitting to his colleagues, agreed to a\r\ncurious diplomatic manoeuvre.  Jay sent to Shelburne a secret message,\r\nurging him to deal separately with the United States under a proper\r\ncommission and not seek to play into the hands of Spain and France.  He\r\nknew that a French emissary had visited Shelburne, and he dreaded\r\nFrench double-dealing, especially on the question of boundaries and\r\nfishery rights.\r\n\r\nThe British Prime Minister was in the odd position of being appealed to\r\nby one of the three hostile powers to save it from the other two; but\r\nunderlying the situation was the fact that Shelburne, as a Whig since\r\nthe beginning of the American quarrel, was committed to a friendly\r\npolicy toward America.  He knew, moreover, that when Parliament should\r\nmeet he must expect trouble from Fox and the dissatisfied Whigs, as\r\nwell as the Tories, and he was anxious to secure a treaty as soon as\r\npossible.  So yielding, on September 27, he gave Oswald the required\r\ncommission, but, suspecting that he was rather too complaisant, sent\r\nHenry Strachey to assist him.  During the summer, Franklin and Oswald,\r\nin informal {122} discussions, had already eliminated various matters,\r\nso that when negotiations formally opened it took not over five weeks\r\nto agree upon a draft treaty.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the Americans violated their instructions by\r\nfailing to consult Vergennes.  Here Franklin was again overruled by Jay\r\nand Adams, whose antipathy to French and Spanish influence was\r\ninsuperable.  It does not appear that Vergennes had any definite\r\nintention to work against American boundaries or fishery rights; but\r\nthere can be no doubt that Rayneval and Marbois, two of his agents,\r\ncommitted themselves openly in a sense unfavourable to American claims,\r\nand it is likely that, had the negotiations taken place under his\r\ncontrol, the outcome would have been delayed in every way in order to\r\nallow France to keep its contract with Spain, whose attacks on\r\nGibraltar were pushed all through the summer.  As it was, the\r\nnegotiators managed to agree on a treaty of peace which reflected the\r\nWhig principles of Shelburne and the skill and pertinacity of the three\r\nAmericans.  Little trouble was encountered over boundaries, Shelburne\r\nceding everything east of the Mississippi and north of Florida, and\r\ndesignating as a boundary between the United States and Canada in part\r\nthe same line as that in the Proclamation of 1763, from the {123} St.\r\nCroix River to the eastward of Maine, to the Great Lakes and thence\r\nwestward by a system of waterways to the headwaters of the Mississippi.\r\nAt the especial urgence of Adams, whose Massachusetts constituents drew\r\nmuch of their wealth from the Newfoundland fisheries, the right of\r\ncontinuing this pursuit was comprised in the treaty, together with the\r\nright to land and dry fish on unoccupied territories in Labrador and\r\nNova Scotia.  As a possible make-weight, the navigation of the\r\nMississippi was guaranteed to citizens of both the United States and\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty arose over the question of the treatment of\r\nAmerican loyalists and the payment of British debts which had been\r\nconfiscated in every colony.  Shelburne insisted that there must be\r\nrestoration of civil rights, compensation for damages, and a pledge\r\nagainst any future confiscations or disfranchisements for loyalists,\r\nand also demanded a provision for the payment of all debts due to\r\nBritish creditors.  Here the negotiation hung in a long deadlock, for\r\nFranklin, Adams, and Jay were unanimously determined to concede no\r\ncompensation for individuals whom they hated as traitors; while the\r\nBritish negotiators felt bound in honour not to abandon the men who had\r\nlost all and suffered every indignity and {124} humiliation as a\r\npenalty for their loyalty.  At length, progress was made when Adams\r\nsuggested that the question of British debts be separated from that of\r\nTory compensation; so a clause was agreed upon guaranteeing the full\r\npayment of bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\r\n\r\nFinally, after Franklin had raised a counter-claim for damages due to\r\nwhat he called the \"inhuman burnings\" of the British raids since 1778,\r\nit was agreed to insert a clause against any future confiscations or\r\nprosecutions of loyalists and to add that Congress should \"earnestly\r\nrecommend\" to the States the restoration of loyalists' estates and the\r\nrepealing of all laws against them.  At the time the commissioners drew\r\nup this article, they must have known that the Congress of the United\r\nStates had no power to enforce the treaty, and that any such\r\nrecommendations, however \"earnest,\" would carry no weight with the\r\nthirteen communities controlled by embittered rebels, who remembered\r\nevery Tory, alive or dead, with execration.  Nevertheless, it offered a\r\nway of escape, and the British representative signed, on November 30,\r\n1782.  The great contest was at an end.\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin revealed to Vergennes that, unknown to the French court,\r\nthe American commissioners had agreed on a {125} draft treaty, the\r\nFrench minister was somewhat indignant at the trick, and communicated\r\nhis displeasure to his agent in America.  This induced the easily\r\nworried Congress to instruct Livingston, the Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, to write a letter censuring the commissioners; but, although\r\nJay and Adams were hotly indignant at such servility, the matter ended\r\nthen and there.  Vergennes's displeasure was momentary, and the French\r\npolicy continued as before.  The European war was, in fact, wearing to\r\nits end.  Already, in April, 1782, Admiral Rodney had inflicted a sharp\r\ndefeat on De Grasse, capturing five of his vessels, including the\r\nflagship with the admiral himself.  This, together with the extreme\r\ninefficiency of the Spanish fleet, put an end to the hope of further\r\nFrench gains in the West Indies.  Before Gibraltar, also, the allied\r\nfleet of forty-eight vessels did not dare to risk a general engagement\r\nwith a British relieving fleet of thirty, and when in September, 1782,\r\na final bombardment was attempted, the batteries from the fort proved\r\ntoo strong for their assailants.  The allies felt that they had\r\naccomplished all they could hope to, and agreed to terms of peace on\r\nJanuary 20, 1783.  France gained little beyond sundry West India\r\nIslands, but Spain profited to the extent of {126} regaining Minorca\r\nand also Florida.  It was at best a defeat for England, and the Whig\r\nMinistry, which carried it through, was unable to prevent such an\r\noutcome.\r\n\r\nThe American peace was made the pretext for Shelburne's fall, since a\r\ncoalition of dissatisfied Whigs and Tories united in March, 1783, to\r\ncensure it, thereby turning out the Ministry.  But, although Fox\r\nregained control of diplomatic matters and made some slight moves\r\ntoward reopening negotiations, he had no serious intention of\r\ndisturbing Shelburne's work, and the provisional treaty was made\r\ndefinitive on September 3, 1783--the day on which the French treaty was\r\nsigned.  Thus the Americans technically kept to the terms of their\r\nalliance with France in agreeing not to make a separate peace, but as a\r\nmatter of fact hostilities had entirely ceased in America since\r\nJanuary, 1783, and practically since the fall of the North Ministry.\r\nThe British had remained quietly in New York and Charleston,\r\nwithdrawing from all other points, and Washington with his small army\r\nstood at Newburg-on-the-Hudson.  In October, 1783, the last British\r\nwithdrew, taking with them into exile thousands of Tories who did not\r\ndare to remain to test the value of the clauses in the treaty of peace\r\nintended to protect them.  So the last traces of the long contest\r\ndisappeared, {127} and the United States entered upon its career.\r\n\r\nThe treaty, as must have been foreseen by the commissioners themselves,\r\nremained a dead letter so far as the Tories were concerned.  Congress\r\nperformed its part and gave the promised recommendation, but the States\r\npaid no heed.  The loyalists were not restored to civil or property\r\nrights.  The plain provision of the treaty prohibiting further\r\nlegislation against loyalists was defied in several States, and\r\nadditional disqualifications were placed upon those who dared to remain\r\nin the country.  The provision regarding the payment of debts remained\r\nunfulfilled, since there was no mechanism provided in the treaty\r\nthrough which the article could be enforced.  Only from the British\r\ngovernment could the Tories receive any recompense for their\r\nsufferings, and there they were in part relieved.  Very many received\r\ngrants of land in Canada, where they formed a considerable part of the\r\npopulation in several districts.  More went to New Brunswick and Nova\r\nScotia to receive similar grants.  Others spent their days in England\r\nas unhappy pensioners, forgotten victims of a war which all Englishmen\r\nsought to bury in oblivion.  Those who remained in the United States\r\nultimately regained standing and fared better than the exiles, but not\r\nuntil new {128} domestic issues had arisen to obliterate the memory of\r\nrevolutionary antagonisms.\r\n\r\nWith the Treaty of 1782, the mother country and the former colonies\r\ndefinitely started on separate paths, recognizing the fundamental\r\ndifferences which for fifty years had made harmonious co-operation\r\nimpossible.  England remained as before, aristocratic in social\r\nstructure, oligarchic in government, military and naval in temper--a\r\nland of strongly fixed standards of religious and political life, a\r\ncountry where society looked to a narrow circle for leadership.  Its\r\ncommercial and economic ideals, unaltered by defeat, persisted to guide\r\nnational policy in peace and war for two more generations.  The sole\r\nresult of the war for England was to render impossible in future any\r\nsuch perversion of Cabinet government as that which George III, by\r\nintimidation, fraud, and political management, had succeeded for a\r\ndecade in establishing.  Never again would the country tolerate royal\r\ndictation of policies and leaders.  England became what it had been\r\nbefore 1770, a country where parliamentary groups and leaders bore the\r\nresponsibility and gained the glory or discredit, while the outside\r\npublic approved or protested without seeking in any other manner to\r\ncontrol the destinies of the State.  While the English thus sullenly\r\nfell back into their {129} accustomed habits, the former Colonies, now\r\nrelieved from the old-time subordination, were turned adrift to solve\r\nproblems of a wholly different sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE UNITED STATES, 1781-1798\r\n\r\nThe British colonists, who assumed independent legal existence with the\r\nadoption of Articles of Confederation in 1781, had managed to carry\r\nthrough a revolution and emerge into the light of peace.  They were now\r\nrequired to learn, in the hard school of experience, those necessary\r\nfacts of government which they had hitherto ignored, and which, even in\r\nthe agonies of civil war, they had refused to recognize.\r\n\r\nProbably with three-quarters of the American people, the prevailing\r\npolitical sentiment was that of aversion to any governmental control,\r\ncoupled with a deep-rooted jealousy and distrust of all officials, even\r\nthose chosen by and dependent upon themselves.  Their political ideals\r\ncontemplated {130} the government of each colony chiefly by the elected\r\nrepresentatives of the voters, who should meet annually to legislate\r\nand tax, and then, having defined the duties of the few permanent\r\nofficers in such a way as to leave them little or no discretion, should\r\ndissolve, leaving the community to run itself until the next annual\r\nsession.  Authority of any kind was to them an object of traditional\r\ndread, even when exercised by their own agents.  The early State\r\nconstitutions concentrated all power in the legislature, leaving the\r\nexecutive and judicial officials little to do but execute the laws.\r\nThe only discretionary powers enjoyed by governors were in connection\r\nwith military affairs.\r\n\r\nIn establishing the Articles of Confederation the statesmen of the\r\nContinental Congress had no intention of creating in any sense a\r\ngoverning body.  All that the Congress could do was to decide upon war\r\nand peace, make treaties, decide upon a common military establishment,\r\nand determine the sums to be contributed to the common treasury.  These\r\nmatters, moreover, called for an affirmative vote of nine States in\r\neach case.  There was no federal executive or judiciary, nor any\r\nprovision for enforcing the votes of the Congress.  To carry out any\r\nsingle thing committed by the Articles to the Congress, and duly voted,\r\nrequired the {131} positive co-operation of the State legislatures, who\r\nwere under no other compulsion than their sense of what the situation\r\ncalled for and of what they could afford to do.\r\n\r\nThings were, in short, just where the colonists would have been glad to\r\nhave them before the Revolution--with the objectionable provincial\r\nexecutives removed, all coercive authority in the central government\r\nabolished, and the legislatures left to their own absolute discretion.\r\nIn other words, the average American farmer or trader of the day felt\r\nthat the Revolution had been fought to get rid of all government but\r\none directly under the control of the individual voters of the States.\r\nTypical of such were men like Samuel Adams of Massachusetts and Patrick\r\nHenry of Virginia.  They had learned their politics in the period\r\nbefore the Revolution, and clung to the old colonial spirit, which\r\nregarded normal politics as essentially defensive and anti-governmental.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were a good many individuals in the country\r\nwho recognized that the triumph of the colonial ideal was responsible\r\nfor undeniable disasters.  Such men were found, especially, among the\r\narmy officers and among those who had tried to aid the cause in\r\ndiplomatic or civil office during the Revolution.  Experience made them\r\nrealize that the practical abolition of all {132} executive authority\r\nand the absence of any real central government had been responsible for\r\nchronic inefficiency.  The financial collapse, the lack of any power on\r\nthe part of Congress to enforce its laws or resolutions, the visible\r\ndanger that State legislatures might consult their own convenience in\r\nsupporting the common enterprises or obligations--all these\r\nshortcomings led men like Washington, Hamilton, Madison, Webster, a\r\npamphleteer of New England, to urge even before 1781 that a genuine\r\ngovernment should be set up to replace the mere league.  Their\r\nsupporters were, however, few, and confined mainly to those merchants\r\nor capitalists who realized the necessity of general laws and a general\r\nauthority.  It is scarcely conceivable that the inherited prejudices of\r\nmost Americans in favour of local independence could have been\r\noverborne had not the Revolution been followed by a series of public\r\ndistresses, which drove to the side of the strong-government\r\nadvocates--temporarily, as it proved--a great number of American voters.\r\n\r\nWhen hostilities ended, the people of the United States entered upon a\r\nperiod of economic confusion.  In the first place, trade was\r\ndisorganized, since the old West India markets were lost and the\r\nprivileges formerly enjoyed under the Navigation Acts were terminated\r\nby the separation of the {133} countries.  American shippers could not\r\nat once discover in French or other ports an equivalent for the former\r\ntriangular trade.  In the second place, British manufacturers and\r\nexporters rushed to recover their American market, and promptly put out\r\nof competition the American industries which had begun to develop\r\nduring the war.  Specie, plentiful for a few months, now flowed rapidly\r\nout of the country, since American merchants were no longer able to buy\r\nBritish goods by drawing on West India credits.  At the same time, with\r\nthe arrival of peace, the State courts resumed their functions, and\r\ngeneral liquidation began; while the State legislatures, in the effort\r\nto adjust war finances, imposed what were felt to be high taxes.  The\r\nresult was a general complaint of hard times, poverty, and insufficient\r\nmoney.  Some States made efforts to retaliate against Great Britain by\r\ntariffs and navigation laws, but this only damaged their own ports by\r\ndriving British Trade to their neighbours'.  Congress could afford no\r\nhelp, since it had no power of commercial regulation.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the working of the Confederation showed that a majority\r\nof Americans had learned nothing from all their experiences, for the\r\nState legislatures declined to furnish to the central government any\r\n{134} more money than they felt to be convenient, regardless of the\r\nfact that without their regular support the United States was certain\r\nto become bankrupt.  Robert Morris was appointed Financier in 1871, and\r\ntook energetic steps to introduce order into the mass of loan\r\ncertificates, foreign loans, certificates of indebtedness, and\r\nmountains of paper currency; but one unescapable fact stood in his way,\r\nthat the States felt under no obligation to pay their quotas of\r\nexpenses.  In spite of his urgent appeals, backed by resolutions of\r\nCongress, the government revenues remained too scanty to pay even the\r\ninterest on the debt.  Morris resigned in disgust in 1784; and his\r\nsuccessors, a committee of Congress, found themselves able to do\r\nnothing more than confess bankruptcy.  The people of the States felt\r\ntoo poor to support their federal government, and, what was more, felt\r\nno responsibility for its fate.\r\n\r\nWithout revenue, it naturally followed that the Congress of the\r\nConfederation accomplished practically nothing.  As will be shown\r\nlater, it could secure no treaties of any importance, since its\r\nimpotence to enforce them was patent.  It managed to disband the\r\nremaining troops with great difficulty and only under the danger of\r\nmutiny, a danger so great that it took all of {135} Washington's\r\npersonal influence to prevent an uprising at Newburg in March, 1783.\r\nFor the rest, its leaders, men often of high ability--Hamilton,\r\nMadison, King of Massachusetts, Sherman of Connecticut--found\r\nthemselves helpless.  Naturally they appealed to the States for\r\nadditional powers and submitted no less than three amendments: first,\r\nin 1781, a proposal to permit Congress to levy and collect a five per\r\ncent. duty on imports; then, in 1783, a plan by which certain specific\r\nduties were to be collected by State officers and turned over to the\r\ngovernment; and finally, in 1784, a request that Congress be given\r\npower to exclude vessels of nations which would not make commercial\r\ntreaties.  No one of these succeeded, although the first plan failed of\r\nunanimous acceptance by one State only.  The legislatures recognized\r\nthe need, but dreaded to give any outside power whatever authority\r\nwithin their respective boundaries.  While those who advocated these\r\namendments kept reiterating the positive necessity for some means to\r\navert national disgrace and bankruptcy, their opponents, reverting to\r\nthe language of 1775, declared it incompatible with \"liberty\" that any\r\nauthority other than the State's should be exercised in a State's\r\nterritory.  By 1787, it was clear that any hope of specific amendments\r\nwas vain.  Unanimity from {136} thirteen legislatures was not to be\r\nlooked for.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where the States chose to act they produced\r\nimportant results.  The cessions of western lands, which had been\r\nexacted by Maryland as her price for ratifying the Articles, were\r\ncarried out by New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia until\r\nthe title to all territory west of Pennsylvania and north of the Ohio\r\nwas with the Confederation.  Then, although nothing in the Articles\r\nauthorized such action, Congress, in 1787, adopted an Ordinance\r\nestablishing a plan for settling the new lands.  After a period of\r\nprovincial government, substantially identical with that of the\r\ncolonies, the region was to be divided into States and admitted into\r\nthe union, under the terms of an annexed \"compact\" which prohibited\r\nslavery and guaranteed civil rights.  But where the States did not\r\nco-operate, confusion reigned.  Legislatures imposed such tariffs as\r\nthey saw fit, which led to actual inter-State commercial\r\ndiscriminations between New York and its neighbours.  Connecticut and\r\nPennsylvania wrangled over land claims.  The inhabitants of the\r\nterritory west of New Hampshire set up a State government under the\r\nname of Vermont, and successfully maintained themselves against the\r\nState of New York, {137} which had a legal title to the soil, while the\r\nfrontier settlers in North Carolina were prevented only by inferior\r\nnumbers from carrying through a similar secession.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the years 1785-7, the number of those who found the\r\nunrestrained self-government of the separate States another name for\r\nanarchy was enormously increased by a sudden craze for paper money,\r\n\"tender\" laws, and \"stay\" laws which swept the country.  The poorer\r\nclasses, especially the farmers, denounced the courts as agents of the\r\nrich, clamoured for more money to permit the easy payment of\r\nobligations, and succeeded in compelling more than half of the States\r\nto pass laws hindering the collection of debts and emitting bills of\r\ncredit, which promptly depreciated.  Worse remained.  In New Hampshire,\r\narmed bands tried to intimidate the legislature; and in Massachusetts\r\nthe rejection of such laws brought on actual insurrection.  Farmers\r\nassembled under arms, courts were broken up, and a sharp little civil\r\nwar, known as Shays' Rebellion, was necessary before the State\r\ngovernment could re-establish order.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, a sudden strong reaction against mob rule and\r\nuntrammelled democracy ran through the country, swinging all men of\r\nproperty and law-abiding habits powerfully in favour of the demand\r\n{138} for a new, genuinely authoritative, national government, able to\r\ncompel peace and good order.  So the leaders of the reform party\r\nstruck; and at a meeting of Annapolis in October, 1786, summoned\r\noriginally to discuss the problem of navigating the Potomac River, they\r\nissued a call for a convention of delegates from all the States to meet\r\nat Philadelphia in May, 1787, for the purpose of recommending\r\nprovisions \"intended to render the federal government adequate to the\r\nexigencies of the Union.\"  This movement, reversing the current of\r\nAmerican history, gained impetus in the winter of 1787.  Congress\r\nseconded the call; and, after Virginia had shown the way by nominating\r\nits foremost men as delegates, the other States fell into line and sent\r\nrepresentatives--all but Rhode Island, which was the scene of an orgy\r\nof paper-money tyranny, and would take no part in any such meeting.\r\n\r\nOf the fifty-five men present at the Philadelphia convention, not more\r\nthan half-a-dozen were of the old colonial type, which clung to\r\nindividual State independence as the palladium of liberty.  All the\r\nothers felt that the time had come to lay the most thoroughgoing\r\nlimitations upon the States, with the express purpose of preventing any\r\nfuture repetition of the existing inter-State wrangles, and especially\r\nof the financial {139} abuses of the time; and they were ready to gain\r\nthis end by entrusting large powers to the central government.  They\r\ndivided sharply, however, on one important point, namely, whether the\r\nincreased powers were to be exercised by a government similar to the\r\nexisting one, or by something wholly new and far more centralized; and\r\nover this question the convention ran grave danger of breaking up.\r\n\r\nDiscussion began in June, 1787, behind closed doors, with a draft plan\r\nagreed upon by the Virginia members as the working project.  This was a\r\nbold scheme, calling for the creation of a single great State, relying\r\non the people for its authority, superior to the existing States, and\r\nable, if necessary, to coerce them; in reality, a fusion of the United\r\nStates into a single commonwealth.  In opposition to this, the\r\nrepresentatives of the smaller States--Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland\r\nand Connecticut--aided by the conservative members from New York,\r\nannounced that they would never consent to any plan which did not\r\nsafeguard the individuality and equality of their States; and, although\r\nthe Virginia plan commanded a majority of those present, its supporters\r\nwere obliged to permit a compromise in order to prevent an angry\r\ndissolution of the convention.  In keeping with a suggestion of the\r\n{140} Connecticut members, it was agreed that one House of the proposed\r\nlegislature should contain an equal representation of the States, while\r\nthe other should be based on population.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of this compromise put an end to the danger of disruption,\r\nfor all but a few irreconcilables were now ready to co-operate; and in\r\nthe course of a laborious session a final draft was hammered out, with\r\npatchings, changes, and additional compromises to safeguard the\r\ninterests of the plantation States in the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention adjourned, it placed before the people of America a\r\ndocument which was a novelty in the field of government.  In part, it\r\naimed to establish a great State, on the model of the American States,\r\nwhich in turn derived their features from the colonial governments.  It\r\nhad a Congress of two Houses, an executive with independent powers, and\r\na judiciary authorized to enforce the laws of the United States.\r\nCongress was given full and exclusive power over commerce, currency,\r\nwar and peace, and a long list of enumerated activities involving\r\ninter-State questions, and was authorized to pass all laws necessary\r\nand proper to the carrying out of any of the powers named in the\r\nconstitution.  Further, the constitution, the federal laws, and\r\ntreaties were declared to be the supreme {141} law of the land,\r\nanything in a State law or constitution notwithstanding.  In addition,\r\nthe States were expressly forbidden to enter the fields reserved to the\r\nfederal government, and were prohibited from infringing the rights of\r\nproperty.  On the other hand, the new government could not exist\r\nwithout the co-operation of the States in providing for the election of\r\nelectors,--to choose a president--of senators, and of congressmen.  It\r\nwas a new creation, a federal State.\r\n\r\nThere now followed a sharp and decisive contest to gain the necessary\r\nratification by nine commonwealths.  At first, the advocates of strong\r\ngovernment, by a rapid campaign, secured the favourable votes of\r\nhalf-a-dozen States in quick succession; but when it came the turn of\r\nNew York, Massachusetts, and Virginia, the conservative, localistic\r\ninstincts of the farmers and older people were roused to make a\r\nstrenuous resistance.  The \"Federalists,\" as the advocates of the new\r\ngovernment termed themselves, had to meet charges that the proposed\r\nscheme would crush the liberties of the State, reduce them to ciphers,\r\nand set up an imitation of the British monarchy.  But, by the eager\r\nurging of the foremost lawyers and most influential men of the day, the\r\ntide was turned and ratification carried, although with the utmost\r\ndifficulty, and usually with {142} the recommendation of amendments to\r\nperfect the constitution.  In June, 1788, the contest ended; and,\r\nalthough Rhode Island and North Carolina remained unreconciled, the\r\nother eleven States proceeded to set up the new government.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1789, in accordance with a vote of the Congress of the\r\nConfederation, the States chose electors and senators, and the people\r\nvoted for representatives.  But one possible candidate existed for the\r\npresidency, namely, the hero of the Revolutionary War; and accordingly\r\nWashington received the unanimous vote of the whole electoral college.\r\nWith him, John Adams was chosen vice-president, by a much smaller\r\nmajority.  The Congress, which slowly assembled, was finally able to\r\ncount and declare the votes, the two officers were inaugurated, and the\r\nnew government was ready to assume its functions.\r\n\r\nThere followed a period of rapid and fundamental legislation.  In the\r\nnew Congress were a body of able men, by far the greater number of them\r\nzealous to establish a strong authoritative government, and to complete\r\nthe victory of the Federalists.  The defeated States' Rights men now\r\nstood aside, watching their conquerors carry their plan to its\r\nconclusion.  Led for the most part by James Madison of the House, {143}\r\nCongress passed Acts creating executive departments with federal\r\nofficials; establishing a full independent federal judiciary, resident\r\nin every State, with a supreme court above all; imposing a tariff for\r\nrevenue and for protection to American industries, and appropriating\r\nmoney to settle the debts of the late confederation.  In addition, it\r\nframed and submitted to the States a series of constitutional\r\namendments whose object was to meet Anti-federalist criticisms by\r\nsecuring the individual against oppression from the federal government.\r\nWhen Congress adjourned in September, 1789, after its first session, it\r\nhad completed a thoroughgoing political revolution.  In place of a\r\nloose league of entirely independent States, there now existed a\r\ngenuine national government, able to enforce its will upon individuals\r\nand to perform all the functions of any State.\r\n\r\nThat the American people, with their political inheritance, should have\r\nconsented even by a small majority to abandon their traditional lax\r\ngovernment, remains one of the most remarkable political decisions in\r\nhistory.  It depended upon the concurrence of circumstances which, for\r\nthe moment, forced all persons of property and law-abiding instincts to\r\njoin together in all the States to remedy an intolerable situation.\r\n{144} The leaders, as might be expected, were a different race of\r\nstatesmen, on the whole, from those who had directed events prior to\r\n1776.  Washington and Franklin favoured the change; but Richard Henry\r\nLee and Patrick Henry were eager opponents, Samuel Adams was\r\nunfriendly, and Thomas Jefferson, in Paris, was unenthusiastic.  The\r\nmain work was done by Hamilton, Madison, John Marshall, Gouverneur\r\nMorris, Fisher Ames--men who were children in the days of the Stamp\r\nAct.  The old agitators and revolutionists were superseded by a new\r\ntype of politicians, whose interests lay in government, not opposition.\r\n\r\nBut the fundamental American instincts were not in reality changed;\r\nthey had only ebbed for the moment.  No sooner did Congress meet in its\r\nsecond session in January, 1790, and undertake the task of reorganizing\r\nthe chaotic finances of the country, than political unanimity vanished,\r\nand new sectional and class antagonisms came rapidly to the front in\r\nwhich could be traced the return of the old-time colonial habits.  The\r\ncentral figure was no longer Madison, but Hamilton, Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, who aspired to be a second William Pitt, and submitted an\r\nelaborate scheme for refunding the entire American debt.  In addition,\r\nhe called for an excise tax, and {145} later recommended the chartering\r\nof a National Bank to serve the same function in America that the Bank\r\nof England performed in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nDaring, far-sighted, based on the methods of English financiers,\r\nHamilton's plans bristled with points certain to arouse antagonism.  He\r\nproposed to refund and pay the debt at its face value to actual\r\nholders, regardless of the fact that the nearly worthless federal stock\r\nand certificates of indebtedness had fallen into the hands of\r\nspeculators; he recommended that the United States should assume, fund,\r\nand pay the war debt of the States, disregarding the fact that, while\r\nsome States were heavily burdened, others had discharged their\r\nobligations.  He urged an excise tax on liquors, although such an\r\ninternal tax was an innovation in America and was certain to stir\r\nintense opposition; he suggested the chartering of a powerful bank, in\r\nspite of the absence of any clause in the constitution authorizing such\r\naction.  Hamilton was, in fact, a great admirer of the English\r\nconstitution and political system, and he definitely intended to\r\nstrengthen the new government by making it the supreme financial power\r\nand enlisting in its support all the moneyed interests of the country.\r\nProperty, as in England, must be the basis of government.\r\n\r\n{146}\r\n\r\nAgainst his schemes, there immediately developed a rising opposition\r\nwhich made itself felt in Congress, in State legislatures, in the\r\nnewspapers, and finally in Washington's own Cabinet.  All the farmer\r\nand debtor elements in the country disliked and dreaded the financial\r\nmanipulations of the brilliant secretary; and the Virginian planters,\r\nuniversally borrowers, who had been the strongest single power in\r\nestablishing the new constitution, now swung into opposition to the\r\nadministration.  Madison led the fight in the House against Hamilton's\r\nmeasures; and Jefferson, in the Cabinet, laid down, in a memorandum of\r\nprotest against the proposed bank, the doctrine of \"strict\r\nconstruction\" of the constitution according to which the powers granted\r\nto the federal government ought to be narrowly construed in order to\r\npreserve the State governments, the source of liberty, from\r\nencroachment.  He denounced the bank, accordingly, as unwarranted by\r\nthe constitution, corrupt, and dangerous to the safety of the country.\r\nIn the congressional contest Hamilton was successful, for all his\r\nrecommendations were adopted, but at the cost of creating a lasting\r\nantagonism in the southern States and in the western regions.\r\n\r\nIn 1791, Jefferson and Madison co-operated to establish a newspaper at\r\nPhiladelphia whose sole occupation consisted in denouncing {147} the\r\ncorrupt and monarchical Secretary of the Treasury.  Hamilton retorted\r\nby publishing letters charging Jefferson with responsibility for it;\r\nand Washington, who steadily approved Hamilton's  policies, found his\r\nCabinet splitting into two factions.  By the year 1792, when the second\r\npresidential election took place, the opposition, styling itself\r\n\"Republican,\" was sufficiently well organized to run George Clinton,\r\nformerly the Anti-federalist leader of New York, for the\r\nVice-Presidency against the \"monarchical\" Adams.  Washington was not\r\nopposed, but no other one of the Hamiltonian supporters escaped attack.\r\nThere was, in short, the beginning of the definite formation of\r\npolitical parties on lines akin to those which existed in the period\r\nbefore 1787.  Behind Jefferson and Madison were rallying all the\r\ncolonial-minded voters, to whom government was at best an evil and to\r\nwhom, under any circumstances, strong authority and elaborate finance\r\nwere utterly abhorrent.  Around Hamilton gathered the men whose\r\ninterests lay in building up a genuine, powerful, national\r\ngovernment--the merchants, shipowners, moneyed men and creditors\r\ngenerally in the northern States--and, of course, all Tories.\r\n\r\nUp to 1793, the Federalist administration successfully maintained its\r\nground; and, when {148} the Virginian group tried in the House to prove\r\nlaxity and mismanagement against Hamilton, he was triumphantly\r\nvindicated.  Had the United States been allowed to develop in\r\ntranquillity and prosperity for a generation, it is not unlikely that\r\nthe Federalist party might have struck its roots so deeply as to be\r\nimpervious to attacks.  But it needed time, for in contrast to the\r\nJeffersonian party, whose origin is manifestly in the old-time colonial\r\npolitical habits of democracy, local independence, and love of lax\r\nfinance, the Federalist party was a new creation, with no traditions to\r\nfall back upon.  Reflecting in some respects British views, notably in\r\nits distrust of the masses and its respect for property and wealth, it\r\nfar surpassed any English party of the period, except the small group\r\nled by William Pitt, in its demand for progressive and vigorous\r\nlegislation.  In 1793, when matters were in this situation, the state\r\nof European and British politics suddenly brought the United States\r\ninto the current of world politics, and subjected the new\r\nadministration to difficulties, which were ultimately to cause its\r\ndownfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{149}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PERIOD OF COMMERCIAL ANTAGONISM, 1783-1795\r\n\r\nWhile the United States had been undergoing the important changes of\r\nthe period, 1783-1793, England had passed through an almost equally\r\nsignificant political transformation, in course of which the two\r\ncountries entered upon a long history of difficult and unfriendly\r\ndiplomatic relations.  The treaty of peace ended the political union of\r\nthe two communities, but it left the nature of their commercial\r\nrelations to be settled; and this, for the United States, was a problem\r\nsecond only in importance to that of federal government.  If the\r\nprosperity of the thirteen States was to be restored, the old-time\r\ntrade routes of the colonial days must be re-established.  The West\r\nIndia market for fish, grain, and lumber, the British or European\r\nmarket for plantation products must be replaced on a profitable basis,\r\nand the United States must be prepared to purchase these privileges by\r\nwhatever concessions lay in its power to grant.  It rested chiefly with\r\nEngland to decide whether to permit the former colonies to resume their\r\nearlier commercial system or begin a new policy, for it was with\r\nBritain and the British colonies {150} that seven-eighths of American\r\ncommerce naturally was carried on.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the people of the United States, and unfortunately\r\nfor the harmony of the two countries, the prevailing beliefs of English\r\nmerchants, shipowners, naval authorities, and, in general, the official\r\nclasses were such as to render a complete resumption of the former\r\ntrade relations almost impossible.  According to the political and\r\neconomic doctrines underlying the Acts of Trade, the moment that the\r\ntwo countries became separated their interests automatically became\r\nantagonistic.  American shipping, formerly fostered when under the\r\nflag, now assumed the aspect of a formidable rival to the British\r\nmerchant marine and, as such, ought to be prevented from taking any\r\nprofit which by any device could be turned toward British ships.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace had scarcely been signed when there appeared a\r\npamphlet by Lord Sheffield, early in 1783, which won instant success,\r\npassing through several editions.  This announced that henceforward it\r\nwas the duty of the British government to discourage and crush American\r\nnavigation to the extent of its power in order to check a dangerous\r\nrival, taking especial care to reserve the West Indies for exclusive\r\nBritish control.  At the possibility of losing the {151} profitable\r\nAmerican market through retaliatory measures, Sheffield laughed in\r\nscorn.  \"We might as reasonably dread the effect of combinations among\r\nthe German as among the American States,\" he sneered, \"and deprecate\r\nthe resolves of the Diet as those of Congress.\"  There were elements,\r\nof course, to whom these arguments of Sheffield were unwelcome,\r\nparticularly the West India planters themselves, and to a degree the\r\nBritish manufacturers, who would gladly have resumed the trade of the\r\nyears before 1776; but, so far as the great majority of Englishmen was\r\nconcerned, it seems impossible to doubt that Lord Sheffield was a true\r\nspokesman of their convictions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the economic theories of the time, the temper of the\r\nBritish people was sullen, hostile, and contemptuous toward the former\r\ncolonies.  The bulk of the nation had come to condemn the policy of the\r\nNorth Ministry which had led to the loss of the plantations, but they\r\ndid not love the Americans any the more for that.  The sharp social\r\ndistinctions, which prior to 1776 had rendered the nobility, the\r\ngentry, the clergy, and the professions contemptuous toward the\r\ncolonists, still reigned unchecked; and the Tories and most of the\r\nruling classes, regarding the Americans as a set of ungrateful and\r\nspiteful people, whom it was well {152} to have lost as subjects,\r\nceased to take any interest in their existence.  The United States was\r\ndropped, as an unpleasant subject is banished from conversation; and\r\nthe relations of the two countries became a matter of national concern\r\nonly when the interests of shipowners, merchants, or naval authorities\r\nwere sufficiently strong to compel attention from the governing classes.\r\n\r\nThe Whig leaders should, of course, be excepted from this general\r\nstatement, for they and their followers--both their parliamentary\r\ncoterie and their middle-class adherents outside--retained a friendly\r\nattitude, and tried to treat the United States with a consideration\r\nwhich usually had no place in Tory manners.  But Whigs as well as\r\nTories held the prevailing conceptions of naval and economic\r\nnecessities, and only scattered individuals, like William Pitt, were\r\naffected by the new doctrines of Adam Smith.  Their commercial policy\r\ntended to differ only in degree from that of the more rigid Tories.\r\n\r\nTo make it certain that the United States should fail to secure\r\nfavourable commercial rights, the ascendancy of the Whigs came to a\r\nsudden end within a year from its beginning.  The Shelburne Ministry,\r\nwhich made the peace, had to meet the opposition not only of the Tories\r\nbut of the group led by Fox.  In the session of 1783, the Whig party\r\n{153} was thus openly split, and presently all England was scandalized\r\nto see Fox enter into a coalition with no less a person than Lord North\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining office.  Shelburne resigned on February\r\n24, after the passage of a resolution of censure on the Peace; and\r\nGeorge III, after trying every expedient to avoid what he considered a\r\npersonal disgrace, was forced, on April 2, to admit Fox and North as\r\nMinisters under the nominal headship of the Duke of Portland.  So\r\nTories were restored to a share in the government, since nearly half of\r\nthe coalition majority depended upon Tory votes.  In December, 1783,\r\nthe King, by a direct exercise of his influence, caused the Lords to\r\nthrow out a Ministerial bill for the government of India and,\r\ndismissing the coalition Ministers, he appealed to William Pitt.  That\r\nyouthful politician, who had first entered office as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer under Shelburne, succeeded, after a sharp parliamentary\r\ncontest, in breaking down the opposition majority in the House, and in\r\na general election in March, 1784, won a great victory.  Then, at the\r\nhead of a mixed Cabinet, supported by Tories and King's Friends as well\r\nas by his own followers from among the Whigs, Pitt maintained himself,\r\nsecure in the support of George III, but in no sense his agent or tool.\r\nIn the {154} next few years, he made his hold secure by his skill in\r\nparliamentary leadership and his success in carrying financial and\r\nadministrative reforms.  This was the first peace Ministry since that\r\nof Pelham, 1746-1754, which won prestige through efficient government.\r\nIt was, however, mainly Tory in temper, and as such distinctly cold and\r\nunfriendly toward America.  Pitt himself was undoubtedly in favour of\r\nliberal commercial relations; but in that respect, as in the question\r\nof parliamentary reform, he followed the opinions of his supporters and\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nThe British policy toward the United States, under the circumstances,\r\nwas dictated by a strict adherence to the principles set forth by Lord\r\nSheffield.  Pitt, while Chancellor of the Exchequer under Shelburne,\r\nintroduced a very liberal Bill, which, if enacted, would have secured\r\nfull commercial reciprocity, including the West India trade.  This\r\nfailed to pass, however, and was abandoned when Pitt left office in\r\nApril, 1783.  The Fox-North Ministry followed a different plan by\r\ncausing Parliament to pass a Bill authorizing the Crown to regulate the\r\ntrade with the West Indies.  They then, by proclamation, allowed the\r\nislands to import certain articles from the United States, not\r\nincluding fish or lumber, and {155} only in British bottoms.  It was\r\nhoped that Canada would take the place of the United States in\r\nsupplying the West India colonies, and that British vessels would\r\nmonopolize the carrying.  In 1787 this action was ratified by\r\nParliament, and the process of discouraging American shipping was\r\nadopted as a national policy.  American vessels henceforward came under\r\nthe terms of the Navigation Acts, and could take part only in the\r\ndirect trade between their own country and England.  When John Adams,\r\nin 1785, arrived at London as Minister, and tried to open the subject\r\nof a commercial treaty, he was unable to secure the slightest attention\r\nto the American requests and felt himself to be in an atmosphere of\r\nhostility and social contempt.  The British policy proved in a few\r\nyears fairly successful.  It reduced American shipping trading with\r\nEngland, it drove American vessels from the British West Indies, and,\r\nowing to the impossibility of the States retaliating separately, it did\r\nnot diminish the British market in America.  Up to 1789, when the first\r\nCongress of the United States passed a navigation act and adopted\r\ndiscriminating duties, America remained commercially helpless.  The\r\nprofit went to British shipowners and merchants.\r\n\r\nThe American government naturally {156} turned to the other powers\r\nhaving American possessions, France and Spain, hoping to secure from\r\nthem compensating advantages.  So far as France was concerned, the\r\ngovernment of Louis XVI was friendly; but its finances were in such\r\nconfusion and its administration so unsteady after 1783 that Jefferson,\r\nMinister to France, could secure no important concessions save one.  In\r\n1784, as though to step into the place left vacant by the English, the\r\nFrench crown, by royal order, permitted direct trade between the United\r\nStates and the French West Indies in vessels of less than sixty tons\r\nburden.  The result was striking.  In a few years the American molasses\r\ntrade, driven from the British islands, took refuge at San Domingo,\r\nbuilding up a tremendous sugar export and more than filling the place\r\nof the British trade.  In 1790 the commerce of San Domingo surpassed\r\nthat of all the British Islands together.  Here again, French\r\nfriendship shone in contrast to English antagonism.  Every American\r\nshipowner felt the difference, and remembered it.\r\n\r\nWith Spain the United States was less successful.  Jay, Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs, undertook negotiations through Diego Gardoqui, a\r\nSpaniard who, during the Revolution, had furnished many cargoes of\r\nsupplies.  He {157} found that country sharply dissatisfied over the\r\nboundary assigned to the United States.  The British, in ceding Florida\r\nto Spain, had not turned over all of their province of 1763, but had\r\nhanded that part of it north of thirty-two degrees to the United\r\nStates, and, further, had granted the latter the free navigation of the\r\nMississippi, through Spanish territory.  Gardoqui offered in substance\r\nto make a commercial treaty provided the United States would surrender\r\nthe claim to navigate the Mississippi for twenty years.  Jay, to whose\r\nmind the interests of the seaboard shipowners and producers far\r\noutweighed the desires of the few settlers of the interior waters, was\r\nwilling to make the agreement.  But an angry protest went up from the\r\nsouthern States, whose land claims stretched to the Mississippi, and he\r\ncould secure, in 1787, a vote of only seven States to five in Congress.\r\nSince all treaties required the consent of nine States, this vote\r\nkilled the negotiations.  Spain remained unfriendly, and continued to\r\nintrigue with the Indian tribes in the south-western United States with\r\na view to retaining their support.\r\n\r\nFurther north, the United States found itself mortified and helpless\r\nbefore British antagonism.  After 1783 the country had Canada on its\r\nnorthern border as a small but actively hostile neighbour, for there\r\n{158} thousands of proscribed and ruined Tories had taken refuge.  The\r\ngovernors of Canada, Carlton and Simcoe, as well as the men commanding\r\nthe frontier posts, had served against the Americans and regarded them\r\nas rivals.  To secure the western fur trade and to retain a hold over\r\nthe western Indians was recognized as the correct and necessary policy\r\nfor Canada; and the British government, in response to Canadian\r\nsuggestions, decided to retain their military posts along the Great\r\nLakes within the boundaries of the United States.  To justify them in\r\nso doing, they pointed with unanswerable truth to the fact that the\r\nUnited States had not carried out the provisions of the Treaty of 1783\r\nregarding British debts, and that Tories, contrary to the letter and\r\nspirit of that treaty, were still proscribed by law.  The State courts\r\nfelt in no way bound to enforce the treaty, nor did State legislatures\r\nchoose to carry it out.  British debts remained uncollectible, and the\r\nBritish therefore retained their western posts and through them plied a\r\nlucrative trade with the Indians to the south of the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nIn the years after the war, a steady flow of settlers entered the Ohio\r\nvalley, resuming the movement begun before the Revolution, and took up\r\nland in Kentucky and the Northwest territory.  By 1792 Kentucky {159}\r\nwas ready to be admitted as a State, and Tennessee and Ohio were\r\norganized as territories.  These settlers naturally found the Indians\r\nopposing their advance, and the years 1783-1794 are a chronicle of\r\nsmouldering border warfare, broken by intermittent truces.  During all\r\nthis time it was the firm belief of the frontiersmen that the Indian\r\nhostility was stimulated by the British posts, and hatred of England\r\nand the English grew into an article of faith on their part.\r\nUltimately, the new government under Washington undertook a decisive\r\ncampaign.  At first, in 1791, General St. Clair, invading Ohio with raw\r\ntroops, was fearfully defeated, with butchery and mutilation of more\r\nthan two-thirds of his force; but in 1794 General Wayne, with a more\r\ncarefully drilled body, compelled the Indians to retreat.  Yet with the\r\nBritish posts still there, a full control was impossible.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution, which gave the United States ample powers of\r\nenforcing treaties and making commercial discriminations, did not at\r\nonce produce any alteration in the existing unsatisfactory situation.\r\nSpain remained steadily indifferent and unfriendly.  France, undergoing\r\nthe earlier stages of her own revolution, was incapable of carrying out\r\nany consistent action.  The Pitt Ministry, absorbed in the game of\r\nEuropean politics and in internal {160} legislation, sent a Minister,\r\nHammond, but was content to let its commercial and frontier policies\r\ncontinue.  But when, in 1792, the French Revolution took a graver\r\ncharacter, with the overthrow of the monarchy, and when in 1793 England\r\njoined the European powers in the war against France, while all Europe\r\nwatched with horror and panic the progress of the Reign of Terror in\r\nthe French Republic, the situation of the United States was suddenly\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1793 there came the news of the war between England\r\nand France, and, following it by a few days only, an emissary from the\r\nFrench Republic, One and Indivisible, \"Citizen Edmond Genet,\" arrived\r\nat Charleston, South Carolina, April 15.  There now exploded a sudden\r\noverwhelming outburst of sympathy and enthusiasm for the French nation\r\nand the French cause.  All the remembered help of the days of Yorktown,\r\nall the tradition of British oppression and ravages, all the recent\r\nirritation at the British trade discrimination and Indian policy\r\ncoupled with appreciation of French concessions, swept crowds in every\r\nState and every town into a tempest of welcome to Genet.  Shipowners\r\nrushed to apply for privateers' commissions, crowds adopted French\r\ndemocratic jargon and manners.  Democratic clubs were formed on the\r\nmodel of the Jacobin {161} society, and \"Civic Feasts,\" at which Genet\r\nwas present, made the country resound.  It looked as though the United\r\nStates were certain to enter the European war as an ally of France out\r\nof sheer gratitude, democratic sympathy, and hatred for England.  The\r\nFrench Minister, feeling the people behind him, hastened to send out\r\nprivateers and acted as though the United States were already in open\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\nIt now fell to the Washington administration to decide a momentous\r\nquestion.  Regardless of the past, regardless of the British policy\r\nsince the peace, was it worth while to allow the country to become\r\ninvolved in war at this juncture?  Decidedly not.  Before Genet had\r\npresented his credentials, Washington and Jefferson had framed and\r\nissued a declaration of neutrality forbidding American citizens to\r\nviolate the law of nations by giving aid to either side.  It was not\r\nmerely caution which led to this step.  The Federalist leaders and most\r\nof their followers--men of property, standing, and law-abiding\r\nhabits--were distinctly shocked at the horrors of the Reign of Terror,\r\nand felt with Burke, their old friend and defender in Revolutionary\r\ndays, that such liberty as the French demanded was something altogether\r\nalien to that known in the United States or in England.  And as the\r\n{162} news became more and more ghastly, the Federalists grew rapidly\r\nto regard England, with all its unfriendliness, with all its commercial\r\nselfishness, as the saving power of civilization, and France as the\r\nchief enemy on earth of God and man.  The result was to precipitate the\r\nUnited States into a new contest, a struggle on the part of the\r\nFederalist administration, led by Hamilton and Washington, to hold back\r\nthe country from being hurled into alliance with France or into war\r\nwith England.  In this, they had to meet the attack of the already\r\norganizing Republican party, and of many new adherents who flocked to\r\nit during the years of excitement.\r\n\r\nThe first contest was a short one.  Genet, his head turned by his\r\nreception, resented the strict neutrality enforced by the\r\nadministration, tried to compel it to recede, endeavoured to secure the\r\nexit of privateersmen in spite of their prohibition, and ultimately in\r\nfury appealed to the people against their government.  This conduct\r\nlost him the support of even the most sanguine democrats, and, when the\r\nadministration asked for his recall, he fell from his prominence\r\nunregretted.  But his successor, Fauchet, a less extreme man, was\r\nwarmly welcomed by the opposition leaders, including Madison and\r\nRandolph, Jefferson's {163} successor as Secretary of State, and was\r\nadmitted into the inmost councils of the party.\r\n\r\nHardly was Genet disposed of when a more dangerous crisis arose, caused\r\nby the naval policy of England.  When war broke out, the British\r\ncruisers, as was their custom, fell upon French commerce, and\r\nespecially upon such neutral commerce as could, under the then\r\nannounced principles of international law, be held liable to capture.\r\nConsequently, American vessels, plying their lucrative trade with the\r\nFrench West Indies, were seized and condemned by British West India\r\nprize courts.  It was a British dogma, known as the Rule of 1756, that\r\nif trade by a neutral with enemies' colonies had been prohibited in\r\npeace, it became contraband in time of war, otherwise belligerents, by\r\nsimply opening their ports, could employ neutrals to do their trading\r\nfor them.  In this case, the trade between the French West Indies and\r\nAmerica had not been prohibited in peace, but the seizures were made\r\nnone the less, causing a roar of indignation from the entire American\r\nseacoast.  Late in 1793, the British Ministry added fresh fuel to the\r\nfire by declaring provisions taken to French territory to be contraband\r\nof war.  If an intention to force the United States into alliance with\r\nFrance had been guiding the {164} Pitt Ministry, no better steps could\r\nhave been devised to accomplish the end.  As a matter of fact, the Pitt\r\nMinistry thought very little about it in the press of the tremendous\r\nEuropean cataclysm.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December, 1793, the old questions of Hamilton's\r\nmeasures and the \"monarchism\" of the administration were forgotten in\r\nthe new crisis.  Apparently a large majority in the House, led by\r\nMadison, were ready to sequester British debts, declare an embargo,\r\nbuild a navy, and in general prepare for a bitter contest; but by great\r\nexertions the administration managed to stave off these drastic steps\r\nby promising to send a special diplomatic mission to prevent war.\r\nDuring the summer the excitement grew, for it was in this year that\r\nWayne's campaign against the western Indians took place, which was\r\ngenerally believed to be rendered necessary by the British retention of\r\nthe posts; and also in this same summer the inhabitants of western\r\nPennsylvania broke into insurrection against the hated excise tax.\r\nThis lawlessness was attributed by the Federalists, including\r\nWashington himself, to the demoralizing influence of the French\r\nRevolution, and was therefore suppressed by no less than 15,000\r\nmilitia, an action denounced by the Republicans--as Randolph confided\r\nto the French Minister--as an example of {165} despotic brutality.  Men\r\nwere fast coming to be incapable of cool thought on party questions.\r\n\r\nThe special mission to England was undertaken by the Chief Justice,\r\nJay, the most experienced diplomat in America since the death of\r\nFranklin.  Upon arriving in England, he found the country wild with\r\nexcitement and horror over the French Revolution, and with all its\r\ninterest concentrated upon the effort to carry on war by land and sea.\r\nThe Pitt Ministry was now supported by all Tories, representing the\r\nland-holding classes, the clergy, and the professions, and by nearly\r\nall the aristocratic Whigs.  Burke, one-time defender of the American\r\nRevolution, was exhausting his energies in eloquent and extravagant\r\ndenunciations of the French.  Only a handful of radicals, led by Fox,\r\nSheridan, and Camden, and representing a few constituents, still dared\r\nto proclaim liberal principles.  In all other classes of society,\r\ndemocracy was regarded as synonymous with bestial anarchy and\r\ninfidelity.  Clearly the United States, from its very nature as a\r\nrepublic, could hope for no favour, in spite of the noticeably English\r\nprepossessions of Hamilton's party.\r\n\r\nJay dealt directly and informally with William Grenville, the Secretary\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, and seems rapidly to have come to {166} the\r\nconclusion that it was for the interest of the United States to get\r\nwhatever it could, rather than to endeavour to haggle over details with\r\nan immovable and indifferent Ministry, thereby hazarding all success.\r\nOn his part, Grenville clearly did his best to establish a practicable\r\nworking arrangement, agreeing with Jay in so framing the treaty as to\r\nwaive \"principles\" and \"claims\" and to include precise provisions.  The\r\nup-shot was that when Jay finished his negotiations he had secured a\r\ntreaty which for the first time established a definite basis for\r\ncommercial dealings and removed most of the dangerous outstanding\r\ndifficulties.  British debts were to be adjusted by a mixed commission,\r\nand American claims for unjust seizures in the West Indies were to be\r\ndealt with in similar fashion.  The British were to evacuate the\r\nnorth-western military posts, and, while they did not withdraw or\r\nmodify the so-called \"rule of 1756,\" they agreed to a clear definition\r\nof contraband of war.  They were also ready to admit American vessels\r\nof less than seventy tons to the British West Indies, provided the\r\nUnited States agreed not to export West India products for ten years.\r\nHere Jay, as in his dealings with Gardoqui, showed a willingness to\r\nmake a considerable sacrifice in order to gain a definite small point.\r\nOn the whole, the treaty {167} comprised all that the Pitt Ministry,\r\nengaged in a desperate war with the French Republic, was likely to\r\nconcede.\r\n\r\nThe treaty left England in the winter of 1795 and reached America after\r\nthe adjournment of Congress.  Although it fell far short of what was\r\nhoped for, it still seemed to Washington wholly advisable to accept it\r\nunder the circumstances as an alternative to further wrangling and\r\nprobable war.  Sent under seal of secrecy to the Senate, in special\r\nsession, its contents were none the less revealed by an opposition\r\nsenator, and a tempest of disappointment and anger swept the country.\r\nIn every seaport Jay was execrated as a fool and traitor and burned in\r\neffigy.  Washington watched unmoved.  The Senate voted ratification by\r\na bare two-thirds, but struck out the West India article, preferring to\r\nretain the power of re-exporting French West India produce rather than\r\nto acquire the direct trade with the English islands.  Washington added\r\nhis signature, the British government accepted the amendment, and the\r\ntreaty came into effect.  The West India privilege was, in fact,\r\ngranted by the Pitt Ministry, as in the treaty, owing to the demands of\r\nthe West India planters.  In America the storm blew itself out in a few\r\nweeks of noise and anger, and the country settled down to make the best\r\nof the privileges {168} gained, which, however incomplete, were well\r\nworth the effort.\r\n\r\nSo the Federalist administration kept the United States neutral, and\r\ngave it at last a definite commercial status with England.  It did\r\nmore, for in August, 1795, the north-western Indians, beaten in battle\r\nand deprived of the presence of their protectors, made a treaty\r\nabandoning all claims to the region south of Lake Erie.  The Spanish\r\ngovernment, on hearing of the Jay treaty, came to terms in October,\r\n1795, agreeing to the boundaries of 1783, granting a \"right of deposit\"\r\nto American trades down the Mississippi at or near New Orleans, and\r\npromising to abandon Indian intrigues.  The diplomatic campaign of the\r\nFederalists seemed to be crowned with general success.\r\n\r\nBut in the process the passions of the American people had become\r\ndeeply stirred, and by the end of 1795 the Federalist party could no\r\nlonger, as at the outset, count on the support of all the mercantile\r\nelements and all the townspeople, for, by their policy toward France\r\nand England, Washington, Hamilton, and their associates had set\r\nthemselves against the underlying prejudices and beliefs of the voters.\r\nThe years of the strong government reaction were at an end.  The time\r\nhad come to fight for party existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{169}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY IN THE UNITED STATES, 1795-1805\r\n\r\nWith the temporary shelving of British antagonism, the Federalist\r\nadministration passed its second great crisis; but it was immediately\r\ncalled upon to face new and equally serious differences with France\r\nwhich were ultimately to prove the cause of its downfall.  The\r\nfundamental difficulty in the political situation in America was that\r\nthe two parties were now so bitterly opposed as to render every\r\ngovernmental act a test of party strength.  The Republicans, who\r\naccepted the leadership of Jefferson or of Clinton of New York,\r\ncomprised all who favoured democracy in any sense--whether that of\r\nhuman equality, or local self-government, or freedom from taxes, or\r\nsympathy with France--and all who had any grievance against the\r\nadministration, from frontiersmen whose cabins had not been protected\r\nagainst Indians or who had been forced to pay a whisky tax, to seamen\r\nwhose ships had not been protected by the Jay treaty.  In short, all in\r\nwhom still persisted the deep-rooted colonial traditions of opposition\r\nto strong government and dislike of any but local authorities were\r\n{170} summoned to oppose an administration on the familiar ground that\r\nit was working against their liberties by corruption, usurpation,\r\nfinancial burdens, and gross partisanship for England and against\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the Federalists were rapidly acquiring a state of\r\nmind substantially Tory in character.  They were coming to dread and\r\ndetest \"democracy\" as dangerous to the family and to society as well as\r\nto government, and to identify it with the guillotine and the\r\nblasphemies of the Worship of Reason.  In the furious attacks which,\r\nafter the fashion of the day, the opposition papers hurled against\r\nevery act of the Federalist leaders, and which aimed as much to defile\r\ntheir characters as to discredit their policies, they saw a pit of\r\nanarchy yawning.  Between parties so constituted, no alternative\r\nremained but a fight to a finish; and, from the moment the Federalists\r\nbecame genuinely anti-democratic, they were doomed.  Only accident or\r\nconspicuous success on the part of their leaders could delay their\r\ndestruction.  A single false step on their part meant ruin.\r\n\r\nWith the ratification of the Jay treaty, a long period of peaceful\r\nrelations began between England and the United States.  The American\r\nshipowners quickly adapted themselves to the situation, and were soon\r\n{171} prosperously occupied in neutral commerce.  In England, American\r\naffairs dropped wholly out of public notice during the exciting and\r\nanxious years of the war of the second coalition.  The Pitt Ministry\r\nended, leaving the country under the grip of a rigid repression of all\r\nliberal thought or utterance, and was followed by the commonplace\r\nToryism of Addington and his colleagues.  Then came the Treaty of\r\nAmiens with France, the year of peace, the renewed war in 1803, and,\r\nafter an interval of confused parliamentary wranglings, the return to\r\npower of Pitt in 1804, called by the voice of the nation to meet the\r\ncrisis of the threatened French invasion.  The United States was\r\nforgotten, diplomatic relations sank to mere routine.  Such were the\r\nunquestionable benefits of the execrated treaty made by Jay and\r\nGrenville.\r\n\r\nWith France, however, American relations became suddenly strained, as a\r\nresult of the same treaty.  The French Republic, in the year 1795, was\r\nfinally reorganized under a definite constitution as a Directorate--a\r\nrepublic with a plural executive of five.  This government, ceasing to\r\nbe merely a revolutionary body, undertook to play the game of grand\r\npolitics and compelled all the neighbouring smaller States to submit to\r\ndemocratic revolutions, accept a constitution on the French model, and\r\nbecome {172} dependent allies of the French Republic.  The local\r\ndemocratic faction, large or small, was in each case utilized to carry\r\nthrough this programme, which was always accompanied with corruption\r\nand plunder to swell the revenues of France and fill the pockets of the\r\ndirectors and their agents.  Such a policy the Directorate now\r\nendeavoured, as a matter of course, to carry out with the United\r\nStates, expecting to ally themselves with the Jeffersonian party and to\r\nbribe or bully the American Republic into a lucrative alliance.  The\r\nway was prepared by the infatuation with which Randolph, Jefferson,\r\nMadison, and other Republican leaders had unbosomed themselves to\r\nFauchet, and also by an unfortunate blunder which had led Washington to\r\nsend James Monroe as Minister to France in 1794.  This man was known to\r\nbe an active sympathizer with France, and it was hoped that his\r\ninfluence would assist in keeping friendly relations; but his conduct\r\nwas calculated to do nothing but harm.  When the news of the Jay treaty\r\ncame to France, the Directorate chose to regard it as an unfriendly\r\nact, and Monroe, sharing their feelings, exerted himself rather to\r\nmollify their resentment than to justify his country.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 a new Minister, Adet, was sent to the United States to remain\r\nonly in case {173} the government should adopt a just policy toward\r\nFrance.  This precipitated a party contest squarely on the issue of\r\nFrench relations.  In the first place Congress, after a bitter struggle\r\nand by a bare majority, voted to appropriate the money to carry the Jay\r\ntreaty into effect.  This was a defeat for the French party.  In the\r\nsecond place, in spite of a manifesto issued by Adet, threatening\r\nFrench displeasure, the presidential electors gave a majority of three\r\nvotes for Adams over Jefferson to succeed Washington.  The election had\r\nbeen a sharp party struggle, the whole theory of a deliberate choice by\r\nelectors vanishing in the stress of partisan excitement.  After this\r\nsecond defeat, the French Minister withdrew, severing diplomatic\r\nrelations; and French vessels began to capture American merchantmen, to\r\nimpress the country with the serious results of French irritation.  The\r\nWashington administration now recalled Monroe and sent C. C. Pinckney\r\nto replace him, but the Directory, while showering compliments upon\r\nMonroe, refused to receive Pinckney at all and virtually expelled him\r\nfrom the country.  In the midst of these annoying events, Washington's\r\nterm closed, and the sorely tried man, disgusted with party abuse and\r\nwhat he felt to be national ingratitude, retired to his Virginia\r\nestates, no longer {174} the president of the whole country, but the\r\nleader of a faction.  His Farewell Address showed, under its stately\r\nphrases, his detestation of party controversy and his fears for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWashington's successor, Adams, was a man of less calmness and\r\nsteadiness of soul; independent, but with a somewhat petulant habit of\r\nmind, and nervously afraid of ceasing to be independent; a man of sound\r\nsense, yet of a too great personal vanity.  His treatment of the French\r\nsituation showed national pride and dignity as well as an adherence to\r\nthe traditional Federalist policy of avoiding war.  Unfortunately, his\r\nhandling of the party leaders was so deficient in tact as to assist in\r\nbringing quick and final defeat upon himself and upon them.\r\n\r\nThe relations with France rapidly developed into an international\r\nscandal.  Adams, supported by his party, determined to send a mission\r\nof three, including Pinckney, in order to restore friendly relations,\r\nas well as to protest against depredations and seizures which the few\r\nFrench cruisers at sea were now beginning to make.  In the spring of\r\n1798, however, the commission reported that its efforts had failed, and\r\nAdams was obliged to lay its correspondence before Congress.  This\r\nshowed that the great obstacle in the way of carrying on {175}\r\nnegotiations with the French had been the persistent demands on the\r\npart of Talleyrand--the French Minister of Foreign Affairs--for a\r\npreliminary money payment, either under the form of a so-called \"loan\"\r\nor as a bribe outright.  Such a revelation of venality struck dumb the\r\nRepublican leaders who had kept asserting their distrust of Adams's\r\nsincerity and accusing the administration of injustice toward France.\r\nIt took all heart out of the opposition members of Congress, and\r\nencouraged the Federalists to commit the government to actual\r\nhostilities with the hated Democrats and Jacobins.  Declaring the\r\ntreaties of 1778 to be abrogated, Congress authorized naval reprisals,\r\nvoted money and a loan, and so began what was called a \"quasi-war,\"\r\nsince neither side made a formal declaration.  Adams, riding on the\r\ncrest of a brief wave of popularity, declared in a message to Congress\r\nthat he would never send another Minister to France without receiving\r\nassurances that he would be received as \"befitted the representative of\r\na great, free, powerful, and independent nation.\"  \"Millions for\r\ndefence, but not a cent for tribute!\" became the Federalist watch-word;\r\nand, when the little navy of a few frigates and sloops began to bring\r\nin French men-of-war and privateers as prizes, the country actually\r\nfelt a thrill of pride and {176} manhood.  For the moment, the United\r\nStates stood side by side with England in fighting the dangerous enemy\r\nof civilization.  American Federalist and British Tory were at one;\r\nAdams and Pitt were carrying on the same war.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Federalists, they failed to appreciate the\r\nfundamental differences between the situation in England and in the\r\nUnited States, for they went on to imitate the mother country not\r\nmerely in fighting the French, but in seeking to suppress what they\r\nfelt to be dangerous \"Jacobinical\" features of American politics.  In\r\nthe summer of 1798, three laws were enacted which have become\r\nsynonymous with party folly.  Two--the Alien Acts--authorized the\r\nPresident at his discretion to imprison or deport any alien, friend or\r\nenemy; the third--the Sedition Act--punished by fine and imprisonment\r\nany utterance or publication tending to cause opposition to a federal\r\nlaw or to bring into contempt the federal government or any of its\r\nofficers.  Such statutes had stood in England since 1793 and were used\r\nto suppress democratic assailants of the monarchy; but such a law in\r\nthe United States could mean nothing more than the suppression by\r\nFederalist courts of criticisms upon the administration made by\r\nRepublican newspapers.  {177} It furnished every opposition agitator\r\nwith a deadly weapon for use against the administration; and when the\r\nSedition Law was actually enforced, and a half-dozen Republican editors\r\nwere subjected to fine or imprisonment for scurrilous but scarcely\r\ndangerous utterances, the demonstration of the inherently tyrannical\r\nnature of the Federalists seemed to be complete.  It was an\r\nunpardonable political blunder.\r\n\r\nEqually damaging to the prosperity of the Federalist party was the fact\r\nthat the French Republic, instead of accepting the issue, showed a\r\ncomplete unwillingness to fight, and protested in public that it was\r\nhaving a war forced upon it.  Talleyrand showered upon the United\r\nStates, through every channel, official or unofficial, assurances of\r\nkindly feelings, and, so soon as he learned of Adams's demand for a\r\nsuitable reception for an American Minister, gave the required\r\nassurance in his exact words.  Under the circumstances, the war\r\npreparations of the Federalists became visibly superfluous, especially\r\na provisional army which Congress had authorized under Hamilton as\r\nactive commander.  The opposition press  and speakers denounced this as\r\na Federalist army destined to act against the liberties of the people;\r\nand the administration could point to no real danger to justify its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n{178}\r\n\r\nSo high ran party spirit that the Virginian leaders thought or affected\r\nto think it necessary to prepare for armed resistance to Federalist\r\noppression; and Madison and Jefferson, acting through the State\r\nlegislatures of Virginia and Kentucky respectively, caused the adoption\r\nof two striking series of resolutions stating the crisis in Republican\r\nphraseology.  In each case, after denouncing the Alien and Sedition\r\nlaws as unconstitutional, the legislatures declared that the\r\nconstitution was nothing more than a compact between sovereign States;\r\nthat the Federal government, the creature of the compact, was not the\r\nfinal judge of its powers, and that in case of a palpable usurpation of\r\npowers by the Federal government it was the duty of the States to\r\n\"interpose,\" in the words of Madison, or to \"nullify\" the Federal law,\r\nas Jefferson phrased it.  Such language seemed to Washington, Adams,\r\nand their party to signify that the time was coming when they must\r\nfight for national existence; but to the opposition it seemed no more\r\nthan a restatement of time-hallowed American principles of government,\r\nnecessary to save liberty from a reactionary faction.  Party hatred now\r\nrivalled that between revolutionary Whigs and Tories.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the election of 1800 took place.  The\r\nFederalist party {179} leaders, feeling the ground quaking under them,\r\nclung the more desperately to the continuance of the French \"quasi-war\"\r\nas their sole means for rallying popular support.  But at this stage\r\nPresident Adams, seeing the folly of perpetuating a sham war for mere\r\nparty advantage, determined to reopen negotiations.  This precipitated\r\na bitter quarrel, for the members of his Cabinet and the leading\r\ncongressmen still regarded Hamilton, now a private citizen in New York,\r\nas the real leader, and followed him in urging the continuance of\r\nhostilities.  Adams, unable to manage his party opponents openly, took\r\nrefuge in sudden, secret, and, as they felt, treacherous conduct and\r\nsent nominations for a new French mission without consulting his\r\nadvisers.  The Federalist Senate, raging at Adams's stupidity, could\r\nnot refuse to ratify the appointments, and so in 1799 the new mission\r\nsailed, was respectfully received by Bonaparte, and was promptly\r\nadmitted to negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe Federalist party now ran straight toward defeat; for, while the\r\nleaders could not avoid supporting Adams for a second term, they hated\r\nhim as a blunderer and marplot.  On his part, his patience exhausted,\r\nAdams dismissed two of his secretaries, in a passion, in 1800.  Later,\r\nthrough the wiles of Aaron Burr, Republican leader in New {180} York, a\r\npamphlet, written by Hamilton to prove Adams's utter unfitness for the\r\nPresidency, was brought to light and circulated.  Against this\r\ndiscredited and disorganized party, the Republicans, supporting\r\nJefferson again for the Presidency and thundering against the Sedition\r\nLaw, triumphantly carried a clear majority of electoral votes in the\r\nautumn; but by a sheer oversight they gave an equal number for\r\nJefferson and for Burr, who was only intended for Vice-president.\r\nHence under the terms of the constitution it became necessary for the\r\nHouse of Representatives to make the final selection, voting by States.\r\nIt fell thus to the lot of the Federalist House of 1800-1801 to choose\r\nthe next President, and for a while the members showed an inclination\r\nto support Burr, as at least a Northerner, rather than Jefferson.  But\r\nbetter judgments ruled, and finally Jefferson was awarded the place\r\nwhich he had in fairness won.  The last weeks of Federalist rule was\r\nfilled with a discreditable effort to save what was possible from the\r\nwreck.  New offices were established, including a whole system of\r\ncircuit judgeships; and Adams spent his time up to the last hour of his\r\nterm in signing commissions, stealing away in the early morning in\r\norder not to see the inauguration of his rival.\r\n\r\n{181}\r\n\r\nSo fell the Federalist party from power.  It had a brilliant record in\r\nlegislation and administration; it had created a new United States; it\r\nhad shown a statesmanship never equalled before or since on the\r\nAmerican continent; but it ruined itself by endeavouring openly to\r\nestablish a system of government founded on distrust of the people, and\r\nmodelled after British precedents.  For a few years, England and the\r\nUnited States approached nearer in government and policy than at any\r\nother time.  But, while in England a large part of society--the\r\nnobility, gentry, middle classes, the professions, the church, and all\r\nstrong political elements--supported Pitt in suppressing free speech\r\nand individual liberty, the Federalists represented only a minority,\r\nand their social principles were abhorrent to the vast majority of the\r\ninhabitants of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party, which conquered by what Jefferson considered to\r\nbe a revolution no less important than that of 1776, represented a\r\nreaction to the old ideals of government traditional in colonial\r\ntimes,--namely as little taxation as possible, as much local\r\nindependence as could exist, and the minimum of Federal authority.\r\nJefferson professed to believe that the conduct of foreign relations\r\nwas the only important function of the central government, {182} all\r\nelse properly belonging to the States.  So complete was the Republican\r\nvictory that the party had full power to put its principles into\r\neffect.  It controlled both Houses of Congress, and was blessed with\r\nfour years of peace and prosperity.  Thomas Jefferson, for all his\r\nradicalism in language, was a shrewd party leader, whose actions were\r\nuniformly cautious and whose entire habit of mind favoured avoidance of\r\nany violent change.  \"Scientific\" with the general interests of a\r\nFrench eighteenth-century \"philosopher,\" he was limited in his views of\r\npublic policy by his education as a Virginia planter, wholly out of\r\nsympathy with finance, commerce, or business.  Under his guidance,\r\naccordingly, the United States government was subjected to what he\r\ncalled \"a chaste reformation,\" rather than to a general overturning.\r\n\r\nAll expenses were cut down, chiefly at the cost of the army and navy;\r\nall appropriations were rigorously diminished, and all internal taxes\r\nwere swept away.  Since commerce continued active, there still remained\r\na surplus revenue, and this Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\napplied to extinguishing the debt.  A few of the more important Federal\r\noffices were taken from embittered Federalists and given to\r\nRepublicans, but there was no general {183} proscription of\r\noffice-holders.  The only action at all radical in character was the\r\nrepeal of the law establishing new circuit judgeships, a step which\r\nlegislated a number of Federalists out of office.  The repeal was\r\ndenounced by fervid Federalist orators as a violation of the\r\nconstitution and a death-blow to the Union; but the appointments under\r\nthe law itself had been so grossly partisan that the country was\r\nunalarmed.  With these steps the Republican reaction ended.  Jefferson\r\nand his party carried through no alteration of the central departments;\r\nthey abandoned no Federal power except that of imposing an excise; they\r\ndid not even repeal the charter of the National Bank.  The real change\r\nlay in the more strictly economical finances and in the general spirit\r\nof government.  The Federalist opposition, criticizing every act with\r\nbitterness and continually predicting ruin, found that under the\r\n\"Jacobins\" the country remained contented and prosperous and was in no\r\nmore danger of atheism or the guillotine than it had been under Adams.\r\nSo matters went on, year after year, the Federal government playing its\r\npart quietly and the American people carrying on their vocations in\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\n\r\nJefferson's general theory of foreign affairs was based on the idea\r\nthat diplomacy was {184} mainly a matter of bargain and sale, with\r\nnational commerce as the deciding factor.  He believed so firmly that\r\nnational self-interest would lead all European powers to make suitable\r\ntreaties with the United States that he considered the navy as wholly\r\nsuperfluous, and would have been glad to sell it.  But when\r\ncircumstances arose calling for a different sort of diplomacy, he was\r\nready to modify his methods; and he so far recognized the unsuitability\r\nof peaceful measures in dealing with the Barbary corsairs as to permit\r\nthe small American navy to carry on extensive operations during 1801-3,\r\nwhich ended in the submission of Tripoli and Algiers.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Jefferson was brought face to face with a diplomatic\r\ncrisis, arising from the peculiar actions of his old ally, France.  At\r\nthe outset of his administration, he found the treaty made by Adams's\r\ncommissioners in 1800 ready for ratification, and thus began his career\r\nwith all questions settled, thanks to his predecessor.  But he had been\r\nin office only a few months when the behaviour of the Spanish officials\r\nat New Orleans gave cause for alarm; for they suddenly terminated the\r\nright of deposit, granted in 1795.  It was quickly rumoured that the\r\nreason was to be found in the fact that France, now under the First\r\nConsul, Napoleon, {185} had regained Louisiana.  It was, in fact, true.\r\nBonaparte overthrew the Directory in 1799 and established himself,\r\nunder the thin disguise of \"First Consul,\" as practical military despot\r\nin France.  He had immediately embraced the idea of establishing a\r\nwestern colonial empire, which should be based on San Domingo, now\r\ncontrolled by insurgent negroes, and which should include Louisiana.\r\nBy a treaty of October 1, 1800, he compelled Spain to retrocede the\r\nformer French province in return for a promise to establish a kingdom\r\nof \"Etruria\" for a Spanish prince.  During 1802 large armaments sailed\r\nto San Domingo and began the process of reconquest.  It needed only the\r\ncompletion of that task for Napoleon to be ready to take over\r\nLouisiana, and thereby to gain absolute control over the one outlet\r\nfrom the interior territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nJefferson at once recognized the extreme gravity of the situation.\r\nDuring the years after the English, Spanish, and Indian treaties,\r\nemigrants had steadily worked their way into the inner river valleys.\r\nWestern New York and Pennsylvania were rapidly filling, Ohio was\r\nsettled up to the Indian treaty line, Kentucky and Tennessee were\r\ndoubling in population, and fringes of pioneer communities stretched\r\nalong the Ohio and {186} Mississippi rivers.  In 1796 Tennessee was\r\nadmitted as a State, and Ohio was now, in 1801, on the point of asking\r\nadmission.  For France to shut the only possible outlet for these\r\ncommunities would be a sentence of economic death; and Jefferson was so\r\ndeeply moved as to write to Livingston, his Minister to France, that if\r\nthe rumour of the cession were true, \"We must marry ourselves to the\r\nBritish fleet and nation.\"  The United States must fight rather than\r\nsubmit.  He sent Monroe to France, instructed to buy an outlet, but the\r\nlatter only arrived in time to join with Livingston in signing a treaty\r\nfor the purchase of the whole of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThis startling event was the result of the failure of Napoleon's forces\r\nto reconquer San Domingo.  Foreseeing the loss of Louisiana in case of\r\nthe probable renewal of war with England, and desirous of money for\r\nimmediate use, the Corsican adventurer suddenly threw Louisiana into\r\nthe astonished hands of Livingston and Monroe.  He had never, it is\r\ntrue, given Spain the promised compensation; he had never taken\r\npossession, and he had promised not to sell it; but such trifles never\r\nimpeded Napoleon, nor, in this case, did they hinder Jefferson.  When\r\nthe treaty came to America, Congress was quickly convened, the Senate\r\nvoted to ratify, the money was appropriated, and the whole {187} vast\r\nregion was bought for the sum of sixty million francs.  Jefferson\r\nhimself, the apostle of a strict construction of the constitution,\r\ncould not discover any clause authorizing such a purchase; but his\r\nparty was undisturbed, and the great annexation was carried through,\r\nJefferson acquiescing in the inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe chagrin of the Federalists at this enormous south-westward\r\nextension of the country was exceeded only by their alarm when an\r\nattempt was made to eject certain extremely partisan judges from their\r\noffices in Pennsylvania and on the Federal bench by the process of\r\nimpeachment.  In the first two cases the effort was successful, one\r\nPennsylvania judge and one Federal district judge being ejected; but\r\nwhen, in 1805, the attack was aimed at the Pennsylvania supreme\r\njustices and at Justice Chase of the United States Supreme Court, the\r\nprocess broke down.  The defence of the accused judges was legally too\r\nstrong to be overcome, and each impeachment failed.  With this the last\r\necho of the party contest seemed to end, for by this time the\r\nFederalists were too discredited and too weak to make a political\r\nstruggle.  Their membership in Congress had shrunk to small figures,\r\nthey had lost State after State, and in 1804 they practically let\r\nJefferson's re-election go by default.  He received all but fourteen\r\n{188} electoral votes, out of 176.  Some of the New England leaders\r\nplotted secession, but they were not strong enough for that.  The party\r\nseemed dead.  In 1804 its ablest mind, Hamilton, was killed in a duel\r\nwith Burr, the Vice-president, and nobody remained capable of national\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nSo the year 1805 opened in humdrum prosperity and national\r\nself-satisfaction.  Jefferson could look upon a country in which he\r\nheld a position rivalled only by that of a European monarch or an\r\nEnglish prime minister.  The principles of Republican equality, of\r\nStates' rights, of economy and retrenchment, of peace and local\r\nself-government seemed triumphant beyond reach of attack.  While Europe\r\nresounded with battles and marches, America lived in contented\r\nisolation, free from the cares of unhappy nations living under the\r\nancient ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{189}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PERIOD OF COMMERCIAL ANTAGONISM, 1805-1812\r\n\r\nIn the year 1805, the happy era of Republican prosperity and complacency\r\ncame suddenly and violently to an end, for by this time forces were in\r\noperation which drew the United States, in utter disregard of Jefferson's\r\ntheories, into the sweep of the tremendous political cyclone raging in\r\nEurope.  In 1803, Napoleon forced England into renewed war, and for two\r\nyears endeavoured by elaborate naval manoeuvres to secure control of the\r\nChannel for a sufficient time to permit him to transport his \"Grand Army\"\r\nto the British shore.  In 1805, however, these plans broke down; and the\r\ncrushing defeat of the allied French and Spanish navies at Trafalgar\r\nmarked the end of any attempt to challenge British maritime supremacy.\r\nThe great military machine of the French army was then turned eastward\r\nagainst the armies of the coalition which England, under Pitt, was\r\nforming; and in a series of astonishing campaigns it was used to beat\r\ndown the Austrians in 1805 at Austerlitz; to overwhelm the Prussians in\r\n1806 at Jena and Auerstadt; and to force the Russians, after {190} a\r\nsevere winter campaign in East Prussia, to come to terms in 1807.\r\nNapoleon and the Tsar, Alexander, meeting on the bridge at Tilsit, July\r\n7, divided Europe between them by agreeing upon a policy of spheres of\r\ninterest, which left Turkey and the Orient for Russian expansion and all\r\nthe beaten western monarchies for French domination.  The Corsican\r\ncaptain, trampling on the ruins both of the French monarchy and the\r\nFrench Republic, stood as the most terrible and astounding figure in the\r\nworld, invincible by land, the master of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut the withdrawal of the French from any attempt to contest the sea left\r\nEngland the equally undisputed master of all oceans, and rendered the\r\nFrench wholly dependent upon neutral nations for commerce.  As French\r\nconquests led to annexations of territory in Italy and in Germany, these\r\nregions also found themselves unable to import with their own vessels,\r\nand so neutral commerce found ever-increasing markets dependent upon its\r\nactivity.  Now the most energetic maritime neutral power was the United\r\nStates, whose merchantmen hastened to occupy the field left vacant by the\r\npractical extinction of the French carrying trade.  Until 1807 they\r\nshared this with the Scandinavian countries; but after that year\r\nNapoleon, by threats and the terror {191} of his name, forced an\r\nunwelcome alliance upon all the States of Europe, and the United States\r\nbecame the sole important neutral.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, the merchant shipping of the United States\r\nflourished enormously, the more especially since, by importing and\r\nimmediately re-exporting West India products from the French islands,\r\nYankee skippers were able to avoid the dangerous \"Rule of 1756,\" and to\r\nsend sugar and cocoa from French colonies to Europe and England under the\r\nguise of American produce.  By 1805, the whole supply of European sugar\r\nwas carried in American bottoms, to the enormous profit of the United\r\nStates.  American ships also shared largely in the coasting trade of\r\nEurope, carrying goods between ports where British ships were naturally\r\nexcluded.  In fact, the great prosperity and high customs receipts to\r\nwhich the financial success of the Jeffersonians was due depended to a\r\ngreat extent on the fortunate neutral situation of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy 1805, the British shipowners felt that flesh and blood could not\r\nendure the situation.  Here were France and her allies easily escaping\r\nthe hardships of British naval pressure by employing neutrals to carry on\r\ntheir trade.  Worse still, the Americans, by the device of entering and\r\nclearing {192} French sugar at an American port, were now able calmly to\r\ntake it to England and undersell the West Indian planters in their own\r\nhome markets.  Pamphleteers began to criticize the government for\r\npermitting such unfair competition, Lord Sheffield, as in 1783, leading\r\nthe way.  In October, 1805, James Stephen, a far abler writer, summed up\r\nthe anger of the British ship-owners and naval officers in a pamphlet\r\nentitled, \"War in disguise, or the Frauds of the Neutral Trade.\"  He\r\nasserted that the whole American neutral commerce was nothing more or\r\nless than an evasion of the Rule of 1756 for the joint benefit of France\r\nand the United States, and he called upon the government to put a stop to\r\nthis practical alliance of America with Napoleon.  This utterance seems\r\nto have made a profound impression; for a time Stephen's views became the\r\nfixed beliefs of influential public men as well as of the naval and\r\nshipowning interests.\r\n\r\nThe first steps indicating British restlessness were taken by the Pitt\r\nMinistry, which began, in 1804, a policy of rigid naval search for\r\ncontraband cargoes, largely carried on off American ports.  Whatever\r\nfriendly views Pitt may once have entertained toward the Americans, his\r\nMinistry now had for its sole object the contest with {193} France and\r\nthe protection of British interests.  In July, 1805, a severe blow was\r\nsuddenly struck by Sir William Scott, who as chief Admiralty judge\r\nrendered a decision to the effect that French sugar, entered at an\r\nAmerican custom-house and re-exported with a rebate of the duty, was good\r\nprize under the Rule of 1756.  This placed all American re-exportation of\r\nFrench West Indian produce at the mercy of British cruisers; and the\r\nsummer of 1805 saw a sudden descent of naval officers upon their prey,\r\ncausing an outcry of anger from every seaport between Maine and Maryland.\r\nThe day of reckoning had come, and Jefferson and Madison, his Secretary\r\nof State, were compelled to meet the crisis.  Fortunately, as it\r\nappeared, for the United States, the Pitt Ministry ended with the death\r\nof its leader on January 23, 1806, and was succeeded by a coalition in\r\nwhich Lord Grenville, author of the Jay treaty, was prime Minister, and\r\nFox, an avowed friend of America, was Foreign Secretary.  While it was\r\nnot reasonably to be expected that any British Ministry would throw over\r\nthe traditional naval policy of impressments or venture to run directly\r\ncounter to shipping interests, it was open to anticipation that some such\r\ncompromise as the Jay treaty might be agreed upon, which would relieve\r\nthe United {194} States from arbitrary exactions during the European war.\r\nThe Grenville Ministry showed its good intentions by abandoning the\r\npolicy of captures authorized by Scott, and substituting, on May 16,\r\n1806, a blockade of the French coast from Ostend to the Seine.  This\r\nanswered the purpose of hindering trade with France without raising\r\ntroublesome questions, and actually allowed American vessels to take\r\nsugar to Northern Europe.\r\n\r\nBetween 1804 and 1806, Jefferson had brought the United States to the\r\nverge of war with Spain through insisting that Napoleon's cession of\r\nLouisiana had included West Florida.  At the moment when British seizures\r\nbegan, he was attempting at once to frighten Spain by warlike words and,\r\nby a payment of two million dollars, to induce France to compel Spain to\r\nacknowledge the American title to the disputed territory.  For a number\r\nof years, therefore, and until the scheme fell through, Jefferson\r\ncultivated especially friendly relations with the government of Napoleon,\r\nnot from any of the former Republican enthusiasm, but solely on\r\ndiplomatic grounds.  Hence, although nominally neutral in the great war,\r\nhe bore the appearance of a French partisan.\r\n\r\nJefferson felt that he had in his possession a thoroughly adequate means\r\nto secure {195} favourable treatment from England, by simply threatening\r\ncommercial retaliation.  The American trade, he believed, was so\r\nnecessary to the prosperity of England that for the sake of retaining it\r\nthat country would make any reasonable concession.  That there was a\r\nbasis of truth in this belief it would be impossible to deny; for England\r\nconsumed American cotton and exported largely to American markets.  With\r\nthis trade cut off, manufacturers and exporters would suffer, as they had\r\nsuffered in the revolutionary period.  But Jefferson ignored what every\r\nAmerican merchant knew, that military and naval considerations weighed\r\nfully as heavily with England as mercantile needs, and that a country\r\nwhich had neither a ship-of-the-line, nor a single army corps in\r\nexistence, commanded, in an age of world warfare, very slight respect.\r\nJefferson's prejudice against professional armed forces and his ideal of\r\nwar as a purely voluntary matter, carried on as in colonial times, was\r\nsufficiently proclaimed by him to be well understood across the Atlantic.\r\nOpenly disbelieving in war, avowedly determined not to fight, he\r\napproached a nation struggling for life with the greatest military power\r\non earth, and called upon it to come to terms for business reasons.\r\n\r\nHis first effort was made by causing {196} Congress to pass a\r\nNon-importation Act, excluding certain British goods, which was not to go\r\ninto effect until the end of 1806.  With this as his sole weapon, he sent\r\nMonroe to make a new treaty, demanding free commerce and the cessation of\r\nthe impressment of seamen from American vessels in return for the\r\ncontinued non-enforcement of the Non-importation Act.  Such a task was\r\nmore difficult than that laid upon Jay twelve years before; and Monroe,\r\nin spite of the fact that he was dealing with the same Minister, failed\r\nto accomplish even so much as his predecessor.  From August to December\r\nhe negotiated, first with Lord Holland, then, after Fox's death, with\r\nLord Howick; but the treaty which he signed on December 1, 1806,\r\ncontained not one of the points named in his instructions.  Monroe found\r\nthe British willing to make only an agreement like the Jay treaty which,\r\nwhile containing special provisions to render the situation tolerable,\r\nshould refuse to yield any British contentions.  That was the Whig policy\r\nas much in 1806 as it had been in 1766.  The concessions were slight; and\r\nthe chief one, regarding the re-exportation of French West Indian\r\nproduce, permitted it only on condition that the goods were bona fide of\r\nAmerican ownership, and had paid in the United States a duty of at least\r\ntwo per cent.  Jefferson {197} did not even submit the treaty to the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nAfter this failure, the situation grew graver.  Napoleon, in December,\r\n1806, issued from Berlin a decree declaring that, in retaliation for the\r\naggressions of England upon neutral commerce, the British Isles were in\r\nblockade and all trade with them was forbidden.  British goods were to be\r\nabsolutely excluded from the continent.  The reply of the Grenville\r\nMinistry to this was an Order in Council, January, 1807, prohibiting\r\nneutral vessels from trading between the ports of France or her allies;\r\nbut this was denounced as utterly weak by Perceval and Canning in\r\nopposition.  In April, 1807, the Grenville Ministry, turned out of office\r\nby the half insane George III, was replaced by a thoroughly Tory cabinet,\r\nunder the Duke of Portland, whose chief members in the Commons were\r\nGeorge Canning and Spencer Perceval, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer respectively.  The United States was now to undergo\r\ntreatment of a new kind at the hands of Tories who despised its\r\ninstitutions, felt only contempt for the courage of its government, and\r\nwere guided as regards American commerce by the doctrines of Lord\r\nSheffield and James Stephen.\r\n\r\nAn Order in Council of November 11, {198} 1807, drafted by Perceval and\r\nendorsed by all the rest of the Cabinet, declared that no commerce with\r\nFrance or her allies was henceforward to be permitted unless it had\r\npassed through English ports.  To this Napoleon retorted by the Milan\r\nDecree of December, 1807, proclaiming that all vessels which had been\r\nsearched by British, or which came by way of England, were good prize.\r\nHenceforth, then, neutral commerce was positively prohibited.  The\r\nmerchantmen of the United States could continue to trade at all only by\r\ndefinitely siding with one power or the other.  The object of the British\r\norder was declared to be retaliation on Napoleon.  Its actual effect was\r\nto place American trade once more under the rule of the Navigation Acts.\r\nAs in the days before 1776, American vessels must make England their\r\n\"staple\" or \"entrepôt,\" and could go only where permitted to by British\r\norders under penalty of forfeiture.  This measure was sharply attacked in\r\nParliament by the Whigs, especially by Grenville and Howick, of the late\r\nMinistry, but was triumphantly sustained by the Tories.\r\n\r\nAt this time the chronic grievance of the impressment of seamen from\r\nAmerican vessels grew suddenly acute.  In the years of the great war, the\r\nAmerican merchant marine, {199} with its safe voyages and good pay,\r\noffered a highly attractive prospect for English sailors, who dreaded the\r\ndanger, the monotony, and the severe discipline of British men-of-war.\r\nThey swarmed by thousands into American service, securing as rapidly as\r\npossible, not infrequently by fraudulent means, the naturalization papers\r\nby which they hoped to escape the press-gang.  Ever since 1793 British\r\nnaval officers, recognizing no right of expatriation, had systematically\r\nimpressed British seamen found on American ships and, owing to the\r\ndifficulty in distinguishing the two peoples, numerous natives of New\r\nEngland and the middle States found themselves imprisoned on the\r\n\"floating hell\" of a British ship-of-the-line in an epoch when brutality\r\ncharacterized naval discipline.  In August, 1807, the United States was\r\nstirred to fury over the forcible seizure by the British _Leopard_ of\r\nthree Englishmen from the U.S.S. _Chesapeake_, which, unprepared for\r\ndefence, had to suffer unresisting.  So hot was the general anger that\r\nJefferson could easily have led Congress into hostile measures, if not an\r\nactual declaration of war, over the multiplied seizures and this last\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nBut Jefferson clung to peace, and satisfied himself by ordering British\r\nmen-of-war out of American ports and sending a {200} demand for\r\nreparation, with which he linked a renunciation of the right of\r\nimpressment.  When Congress met in December, he induced it to pass a\r\ngeneral embargo, positively prohibiting the departure of American vessels\r\nto foreign ports.  Since at the same time the Non-importation Act came\r\ninto effect, all imports and exports were practically suspended.  His\r\nidea was that the total cessation of American commerce would inflict such\r\ndiscomfort upon British and French consumers that each country would be\r\nforced to abandon its oppressive measures.\r\n\r\nRarely has a country, at the instance of one man, inflicted a severer\r\nstrain upon its citizens.  The ravages of French and English together,\r\nsince the outbreak of war in 1793, did not do so much damage as the\r\nembargo did in one year, for it threatened ruin to every shipowner,\r\nimporter, and exporter in the United States.  Undoubtedly Jefferson and\r\nhis party had in mind the success of the non-importation agreements\r\nagainst the Stamp Act and the Townshend duties, but what was then the\r\nvoluntary action of a great majority was now a burden imposed by one part\r\nof the country upon another.  The people of New York and New England\r\nsimply would not obey the Act.  To enforce it against Canada became an\r\nimpossibility, and to prevent vessels from escaping a {201} matter of\r\ngreat difficulty.  Jefferson persisted doggedly, and induced Congress to\r\npass laws giving revenue collectors extraordinary powers of search and\r\nseizure, but without results.\r\n\r\nUnder this intolerable grievance, the people of the oppressed regions\r\nrapidly lost their enthusiasm for the Democratic administration.  Turning\r\nonce more to the Federalist party, which had seemed practically extinct,\r\nthey threw State after State into its hands, and actually threatened the\r\nRepublican control in the Presidential election of 1808.  Had a coalition\r\nbeen arranged between the disgusted Republican factions of New York and\r\nPennsylvania and the Federalists of New England, Delaware, and Maryland,\r\nJames Madison might well have been beaten for successor to Jefferson.\r\nBut worse remained behind.  The outraged New Englanders, led by Timothy\r\nPickering and others, began to use again, in town-meetings and\r\nlegislatures, the old-time language of 1774, once employed against the\r\nFive Intolerable Acts, and to threaten secession.  As Jefferson said\r\nlater, \"I felt the foundations of the government shaken under my feet by\r\nthe New England townships.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time, it was definitely proved that as a means of coercion the\r\nembargo was worthless.  English manufacturers and their {202} workmen\r\ncomplained, but English ship-owners profited, and crowds of British\r\nseamen returned perforce to their home, even at times into the royal\r\nnavy.  Canning, for the Portland Ministry, sarcastically declined to be\r\nmoved, observing that the embargo, whatever its motives, was practically\r\nthe same as Napoleon's system, and England could not submit to being\r\ndriven to surrender to France even to regain the American market or\r\nrelieve the Americans from their self-inflicted sufferings.  Napoleon now\r\ngave an interesting taste of his peculiar methods, for on April 17, 1808,\r\nhe issued the Bayonne Decree, ordering the confiscation of all American\r\nvessels found in French ports, on the ground that, since the embargo\r\nprohibited the exit of American ships, these must, in reality, be\r\nEnglish!  Thus he gathered in about eight million dollars' worth.  The\r\npolicy had to be abandoned, and in the utmost ill-humour Congress\r\nrepealed the embargo, on March 1, 1809, substituting non-intercourse with\r\nEngland and France.  Thus Jefferson left office under the shadow of a\r\nmonumental failure.  His theory of commercial coercion had completely\r\nbroken down; and he had damaged his own and his party's prestige to such\r\nan extent that the moribund Federalist organization had sprung to life\r\nand threatened the existence of the Union.\r\n\r\n{203}\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward, the New Englanders assumed the character of\r\nultra-admirers of Great Britain.  True, their vessels suffered from\r\nBritish seizures; but no British confiscations had done them such harm as\r\nthe embargo, or taken such discreditable advantage of a transparent\r\npretext as the Bayonne Decree.  Belonging to the wealthy classes, they\r\nadmired and respected England as defender of the world's civilization\r\nagainst Napoleon, and they detested Jefferson and Madison as tools of the\r\nenemy of mankind.  They justified impressments, spoke respectfully of the\r\nBritish doctrines of trade, and corresponded freely with British public\r\nmen.  They stood, in short, exactly where the Republicans had stood in\r\n1793, supporters of a foreign power with which the Federal administration\r\nwas in controversy.  In Congress and outside, they made steady, bitter\r\nmenacing attacks on the integrity and honesty of the Republicans.\r\n\r\nUnder Jefferson's successor, the policy of commercial pressure was\r\ncarried to its impotent conclusion.  At first the action of the British\r\ngovernment seemed to crown Madison with triumph.  In the winter of 1809,\r\nthe majority in Congress had talked freely of substituting war for the\r\nembargo; and at the same time the Whigs in Parliament, led by Grenville,\r\nhad attacked Canning for his {204} insolence toward the United States as\r\nlikely to cause war.  Whitbread called attention to the similarity\r\nbetween the conditions in 1809 and 1774, when \"the same infatuation\r\nseemed to prevail,\" the same certainty existed that the Americans would\r\nnot fight, and the same confident assertions were made that they could\r\nnot do without England.  The comparison possessed much truth, for the\r\nTories of 1809 were as indifferent to American feelings as those of 1774,\r\nand pushed their commercial policy just as North had done his political\r\nsystem, in the same contemptuous certainty that the Americans would never\r\nfight.  Yet Canning showed sufficient deference to his assailants to\r\ninstruct Erskine, British Minister at Washington, to notify Madison that\r\nthe Orders would be withdrawn in case the United States kept its\r\nnon-intercourse with France, recognized the Rule of 1756, and authorized\r\nBritish men-of-war to enforce the Non-intercourse Act.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result was surprising, for Erskine, eager to restore\r\nharmony, did not disclose or carry out his instructions, but accepted the\r\ncontinuance by the United States of non-intercourse against France as a\r\nsufficient concession.  He announced that the Orders in Council would be\r\nwithdrawn on June 10; Madison in turn promptly issued a proclamation\r\nreopening trade, and {205} swarms of American vessels rushed across the\r\nAtlantic.  But Canning, in harsh language, repudiated the arrangement of\r\nhis over-sanguine agent, and Madison was forced to the mortifying step of\r\nreimposing non-intercourse by a second proclamation.  Still worse\r\nremained, for when F. J. Jackson, the next British Minister, arrived, the\r\nPresident had to undergo the insult of being told that he had connived\r\nwith Erskine in violating his instructions.  The refusal to hold further\r\nrelations with the blunt emissary was a poor satisfaction.  All this\r\ntime, moreover, reparation for the _Chesapeake_ affair was blocked, since\r\nit had been coupled with a demand for the renunciation of impressments,\r\nsomething that no British Ministry would have dared to yield.\r\n\r\nOn the part of Napoleon, the Non-intercourse Act offered another\r\nopportunity for plunder.  When he first heard of Erskine's concessions,\r\nhe was on the point of meeting them, but on learning of their failure he\r\nchanged about, commanded the sequestration of all American vessels\r\nentering European ports, and in May, 1810, by the Rambouillet Decree, he\r\nordered their confiscation and sale.  The ground assigned was that the\r\nNon-intercourse Act forbade any French or English vessel to enter\r\nAmerican ports under penalty of confiscation.  {206} None had been\r\nconfiscated, but they might be.  Hence he acted.  Incidentally he helped\r\nto fill his treasury, and seized about ten millions of American property.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clear to most Americans that, however unfriendly the\r\nBritish policy, it was honesty itself compared to that of the Emperor,\r\nwhose sole aim seemed to be to ensnare American vessels for the purpose\r\nof seizing them.  The Federalists in Congress expatiated on his perfidy\r\nand bare-faced plunder, but nothing could shake the intention of Madison\r\nto stick to commercial bargaining.  Congress now passed another Act,\r\ndestined to be the last effort at peaceful coercion.  Trade was opened,\r\nbut the President was authorized to reimpose non-intercourse with either\r\nnation if the other would withdraw its decrees.  This Act, known always\r\nas the Macon Bill No. 2, became law in May, 1810, and Napoleon\r\nimmediately seized the occasion for further sharp practice.  He caused an\r\nunofficial, unsigned letter to be shown to the American Minister at Paris\r\nstating that the French decrees would be withdrawn on November 2, 1810,\r\n\"it being understood that the English should withdraw theirs by that time\r\nor the United States should cause its rights to be respected by England.\"\r\nMadison accordingly reimposed non-intercourse with {207} England on the\r\ndate named, and considered the French decrees withdrawn.  The situation\r\nwas regarded by him as though he had entered into a contract with\r\nNapoleon, which compelled him to assert that the decrees were at an end,\r\nalthough he had no other evidence than the existence of the situation\r\narising from the Macon Bill.\r\n\r\nThere followed a period during which the American Minister at London,\r\nWilliam Pinkney, endeavoured without success to convince the British\r\ngovernment that the decrees actually were withdrawn.  The Portland\r\nMinistry had fallen in 1809, and the sharp-tongued Canning was replaced\r\nin the Foreign Office by the courteous Marquess Wellesley; but Spencer\r\nPerceval, author of the Orders in Council, was Prime Minister and stiffly\r\ndetermined to adhere to his policy.  James Stephen and George Rose, in\r\nParliament, stood ready to defend them, and the Tory party as a whole\r\naccepted their necessity.  When, therefore, Pinkney presented his request\r\nto Wellesley, the latter naturally demanded something official from\r\nNapoleon, which neither Pinkney nor Madison could supply.  Finally, in\r\nFebruary, 1811, Pinkney broke off diplomatic relations and returned home,\r\nhaving played his difficult part with dignity.  To aggravate the\r\nsituation Napoleon's cruisers continued, {208} whenever they had a\r\nchance, to seize and burn American vessels bound for England, and his\r\nport authorities to sequester vessels arriving from England.  The decrees\r\nwere not in fact repealed.\r\n\r\nMadison had committed himself, however, to upholding the honour of\r\nNapoleon--a task from which any other man would have recoiled--and the\r\nUnited States continued to insist on a fiction.  Madison's conduct in\r\nthis affair was that of a shrewd lawyer-like man who tried to carry on\r\ndiplomacy between two nations fighting to the death as though it were a\r\nmatter of contracts, words and phrases of legal meaning.  To Napoleon,\r\nlegality was an incomprehensible idea.  To the Tory ministries,\r\nstruggling to maintain their country against severe economic pressure,\r\nfacts, not words, counted, and facts based on naval force.  Upon the\r\nJeffersonian and Madisonian attempts at peaceful coercion they looked\r\nwith mingled annoyance and contempt, believing, as they did, that the\r\nwhole American policy was that of a weak and cowardly nation trying by\r\npettifogging means to secure favourable trade conditions.  The situation\r\nhad reached a point where the United States had nothing to hope from\r\neither contestant, by continuing this policy.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a new political force {209} appeared.  By 1811 the\r\nold-time Republican leaders, trained in the school of Jeffersonian\r\nideals, were practically bankrupt.  Faction paralyzed government, and\r\nCongress seemed, by its timid attitude, to justify the taunt of Quincy of\r\nMassachusetts that the Republican party could not be kicked into a war.\r\nBut there appeared on the stage a new sort of Republican.  In the western\r\ncounties of the older States and in the new territories beyond the\r\nmountains, the frontier element, once of small account in the country and\r\nwholly disregarded under the Federalists, was multiplying, forming\r\ncommunities and governments, where the pioneer habits had created a\r\ndemocracy that was distinctly pugnacious.  Years of danger from Indians,\r\nof rivalry with white neighbours over land titles, of struggle with the\r\nwilderness, had produced a half-lawless and wholly self-assertive type of\r\nman, as democratic as Jefferson himself, but with a perfect willingness\r\nto fight and with a great respect for fighters.  To these men, the\r\ntameness with which the United States had submitted to insults and\r\nplundering was growing to be unendurable.  Plain masculine anger began to\r\nobscure other considerations.\r\n\r\nThese Western men, moreover, had a special cause for indignation with\r\nEngland, {210} which was ignored by the sea-coast communities, in the\r\nclose connection which they firmly believed to exist between the British\r\nadministration of upper Canada and the north-western Indians.  In the\r\nyears after 1809, the Indian question again began to assume a dangerous\r\nform.  Settlers were coming close to the treaty lines, and, to satisfy\r\ntheir demands for the bottom lands along the Wabash River, Governor\r\nHarrison of Indiana Territory made an extensive series of land purchases\r\nfrom the small tribes on the coveted territory.\r\n\r\nBut there now appeared two remarkable Indians, Tecumseh and his brother,\r\nthe Prophet, of the Shawnee tribe, who saw in the occupation of the red\r\nmen's hunting lands and the inroads of frontier corn whiskey the death of\r\nall their race.  These leaders began to hold their own tribe together\r\nagainst the purchase of whiskey or the sale of lands; then, with wider\r\nvision, they tried to organize an alliance of all the north-western\r\nIndians to prevent further white advance.  They even went so far as to\r\nvisit the south-western Indians, Creeks and Cherokees, to induce them to\r\njoin in the grand league.  The very statesmanship involved in this vast\r\nscheme rendered it dangerous in the eyes of all Westerners, who were\r\nfirmly convinced that the backing of {211} this plan came from the\r\nBritish posts in Canada.  There was, in reality, a good understanding\r\nbetween the Canadian officers and the Shawnee chiefs.  In 1811\r\nhostilities broke out at Tippecanoe, where Governor Harrison had a sharp\r\nbattle with the Shawnees; but Tecumseh exerted himself to restore\r\npeaceful relations, although the frontier was in great excitement.\r\n\r\nFrom the States of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, and from the inner\r\ncounties of the southern States there came to the first session of the\r\nEleventh Congress, in December, 1811, a group of young politicians--Henry\r\nClay, John Calhoun, Langdon Cheves, Felix Grundy--who felt that the time\r\nfor talk was at an end.  Unless England immediately revoked its decrees,\r\nceased impressing seamen, and refrained from instigating Indian plots\r\nthere must be war.  Assuming control of the House, with Clay in the\r\nSpeaker's chair, they transformed the Republican party and the policy of\r\nthe country.  They pushed through measures for raising troops, arming\r\nships, and borrowing money.  Congress rang with fiery speeches, as month\r\nafter month went by and the Perceval Ministry obstinately refused to stir\r\nfrom its commercial policy.\r\n\r\nYet the feeling of the English public was already undergoing a change.\r\nBy 1812 the {212} pretence that the Orders in Council were maintained for\r\nthe purpose of starving out France was growing transparent when thousands\r\nof licences, granted freely to British vessels, permitted a vast fleet to\r\ncarry on the supposedly forbidden trade.  Although Perceval and Canning\r\nstill insisted in Parliament that the Orders were retaliatory, the fact\r\nwas patent that their only serious effect was to cause the loss of the\r\nAmerican trade and the American market.  At the threat of war, the\r\nexporters of England, suffering severely from glutted markets, began a\r\nvigorous agitation against Perceval's policy and bombarded the Ministry,\r\nthrough Henry Brougham, with petitions, memorials, and motions which put\r\nthe Tories on the defensive.  Speakers like Alexander Baring held up the\r\nsystem of Orders in Council as riddled with corruption, and only the\r\npersonal authority of Perceval and Castlereagh kept the majority firm.\r\nAt the height of this contest, Perceval was assassinated, on May 11,\r\n1812; and it was not until June 8 that hope of a new coalition was\r\nabandoned, and the Tory Cabinet was definitely reorganized under Lord\r\nLiverpool.  Almost the first act of that Ministry was to bow before the\r\nstorm of petitions, criticisms, and complaints, and to announce on June\r\n16 that they had decided to suspend the Orders.  {213} Thus the very\r\ncontingency upon which Jefferson and Madison had counted came to pass.\r\nThe British government, at the instance of the importing and\r\nmanufacturing classes, yielded to the pressure of American commercial\r\nrestrictions.  It was true that the danger of war weighed far more,\r\napparently, than the Non-intercourse Act; but had there been an Atlantic\r\ncable, or even a steam transit, at that time, or had the Liverpool\r\nMinistry been formed a little earlier, the years 1807-1812 might have\r\npassed into history as a triumphant vindication of Jefferson's theories.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late.  Madison, seeing, apparently, that his plans were a\r\nfailure, fell in with the new majority, and after deliberate preparation\r\nsent a message to Congress in June, 1812, which was practically an\r\ninvitation to declare war.  In spite of the bitter opposition of all\r\nFederalists and many eastern Republicans, Congress, by the votes of the\r\nsouthern and western members, adopted a declaration of war on June 18,\r\ncommitting the United States to a contest with the greatest naval power\r\nin the world on the grounds of the Orders in Council, the impressment of\r\nseamen, and the intrigues with the north-western Indians.  At the moment\r\nwhen Napoleon, invading Russia, began his last stroke for universal\r\nempire, the United {214} States entered the game as his virtual ally.\r\nThis was something the Federalists could not forgive.  They returned to\r\ntheir homes, execrating the war as waged in behalf of the arch-enemy of\r\nGod and man, as the result of a pettifogging bit of trickery on the part\r\nof Napoleon.  They denounced the ambitions of Clay and the Westerners,\r\nwho predicted an easy conquest of Canada, as merely an expression of a\r\npirate's desire to plunder England of its colonies, and they announced\r\ntheir purpose to do nothing to assist the unrighteous conflict.  In their\r\nanger at Madison, they were even willing to vote for De Witt Clinton of\r\nNew York, who ran for President in 1812 as an Independent Republican; and\r\nthe coalition carried the electoral vote of every State north of Maryland\r\nexcept Pennsylvania and Vermont.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the repeal of the Orders in Council crossed the\r\nAtlantic, some efforts were made by the governor-general of Canada to\r\narrange an armistice, hoping to prevent hostilities.  But Madison does\r\nnot seem to have seriously considered abandoning the war, even though the\r\noriginal cause had been removed.  Feeling the irresistible pressure of\r\nthe southern and western Democrats behind him, he announced that the\r\ncontest must go on until England should {215} abandon the practice of\r\nimpressment.  So the last hope of peace disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe war thus begun need never have taken place, had the Tory Ministries\r\nof Portland or Perceval cared to avert it.  The United States only lashed\r\nitself into a war-like mood after repeated efforts to secure concessions,\r\nand after years of submission to British rough handling.  During all this\r\ntime, either Madison or Jefferson would gladly have accepted any sort of\r\ncompromise which did not shut American vessels wholly out from some form\r\nof independent trade.  But the enmity of the British shipowners and naval\r\nleaders and the traditional British commercial policy joined with\r\ncontempt for the spiritless nation to prevent any such action until the\r\nfitting time had gone by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE WAR FOR \"SAILORS' RIGHTS\" AND WESTWARD EXPANSION, 1812-1815\r\n\r\nThe second war between the United States and the mother country, unlike\r\nthe first, was scarcely more than a minor {216} annoyance to the\r\nstronger party.  In the years 1812-1814, England was engaged in\r\nmaintaining an army in Spain, in preying on French commerce by blockade\r\nand cruising, and was spending immense sums to subsidize the European\r\nnations in their final struggle against Napoleon.  The whole military\r\nand financial strength of the country, the whole political and\r\ndiplomatic interest were absorbed in the tremendous European contest.\r\nWhig and Tory, landowner, manufacturer, and labourer were united in\r\nunbending determination to destroy the power of the Corsican.  The\r\nLiverpool Ministry contained little of talent, and no genius, but the\r\nmembers possessed certain traits which sufficed to render others\r\nunnecessary, namely, an unshakable tenacity and steady hatred of the\r\nFrench.  The whole country stood behind them on that score.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, the English, when obliged to fight the United\r\nStates, were at liberty to send an overwhelming naval force to blockade\r\nor destroy American commerce, but were in great straits to provide men\r\nto defend Canada.  It was not until a full year after the declaration\r\nof war that any considerable force of regular troops could be collected\r\nand sent there, and not for two years that anything approaching a\r\ngenuine army could be directed against America.  {217} The defence of\r\nCanada had to be left to the efforts of some few officers and men and\r\nsuch local levies as could be assembled.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the United States, the war was bound to take the form of\r\nan effort to capture all or part of Canada, for that was the only\r\nvulnerable British possession.  On the sea the United States could hope\r\nat most to damage British commerce by means of the few national\r\ncruisers and such privateers as the shipowners of the country could\r\nsend out.  Without a single ship-of-the-line and with only five\r\nfrigates, there existed no possibility of actually fighting the British\r\nnavy.  But on land it seemed as though a country with a population of\r\nover seven millions ought to be able to raise armies of such size as to\r\noverrun, by mere numbers, the slender resources of Canada; and it was\r\nthe confident expectation of most of the western leaders that within a\r\nshort time the whole region would be in American hands.  \"The\r\nacquisition of Canada this year,\" wrote Jefferson, \"as far as the\r\nneighbourhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will\r\ngive us experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and the final\r\nexpulsion of England from the American continent.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the success of these dreams, the policy of the\r\nRepublican administrations had been such as to set up {218} insuperable\r\ndifficulties.  The regular army, reduced under Jefferson's \"passion for\r\npeace\" to a bare minimum, was scattered in a few posts; the War\r\nDepartment was without means for equipping, feeding, and transporting\r\nbodies of troops; the whole mechanism of war administration had to be\r\ncreated.  Further, the Secretary of the Army and nearly all the\r\ngenerals were elderly men, veterans of the Revolutionary Army, who had\r\nlost whatever energy they once possessed.  The problem of war finances\r\nwas rendered serious by the fact that revenue from the tariff, the sole\r\nimportant source of income, was sure to be cut off by the British naval\r\npower.  The National Bank had been refused a new charter in 1811, and\r\nthe government, democratic in its finances as in other matters, relied\r\nupon a hundred odd State banks of every degree of solvency for aid in\r\ncarrying on financial operations.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the American people was exactly what it had been in\r\ncolonial days.  They regarded war as a matter to be carried on at the\r\nconvenience of farmers and others, who were willing to serve in defence\r\nof their homes, but strongly objected to enlisting for any length of\r\ntime.  On the more pugnacious frontier, the prevailing military ideal\r\nwas that of the armed mob or crowd--a body of fighters following a\r\nchosen leader against Indians.  {219} Everywhere the elementary\r\nconceptions of obedience and duty were unknown.  The very men who\r\nwished for war were unwilling to fight except on their own terms.\r\n\r\nStill more fatal to military efficiency was the fact that the\r\nFederalists, and many of the northern Republicans, inhabiting the\r\nregions abutting on Canada, were violently opposed to the war, wished\r\nto see it fail, and were firmly resolved to do nothing to aid the\r\nadministration.  The utmost the Federalists would do was to defend\r\nthemselves if attacked, but they would do that on their own\r\nresponsibility and not under federal orders.\r\n\r\nThe only exception to this prevailing unmilitary condition was to be\r\nfound in the navy, where, through cruising and through actual service\r\nagainst the Barbary corsairs, a genuinely trained body of officers and\r\nmen had been created.  Unable to do more than give a good account of\r\nthemselves on the ocean in single combats, these officers found a\r\nchance on the northern lakes to display a fighting power and skill\r\nwhich is one of the few redeeming features of the war on the American\r\nside.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 hostilities began with a feeble attempt on the part of the\r\nUnited States to invade Canada, an effort whose details are of interest\r\nonly in showing how impossible {220} it is for an essentially\r\nunmilitary people to improvise warfare.  Congress had authorized a\r\nloan, the construction of vessels, and the enlistment of an army of\r\n36,000 men; but the officers appointed to assemble a military force\r\nfound themselves unable, after months of recruiting and working, to\r\ngather more than half that number of raw troops, with a fluctuating\r\nbody of State militia.  With these rudiments of a military force,\r\nattempts to \"invade\" Canada were made in three directions--from\r\nDetroit, from the Niagara River, and from the northern end of Lake\r\nChamplain.\r\n\r\nTo meet these movements, there were actually less than 2,800 British\r\nsoldiers west of Montreal; but fortunately they were commanded by Isaac\r\nBrock, an officer of daring and an aggressive temper.  He at once\r\nentered into alliance with Tecumseh and the western Indians, and thus\r\nbrought to the British assistance a force of hundreds of warriors along\r\nthe Ohio and Kentucky frontier.  While General Hull, with about 2,000\r\ntroops, mainly volunteers from the West, marched under orders to\r\nDetroit and then, in July, invaded upper Canada, the outlying American\r\nposts at Chicago and Mackinac were either captured or destroyed by the\r\nIndians.  Brock, gathering a handful of men, marched against Hull,\r\nterrified him for the safety of {221} his communications with the\r\nUnited States, forced the old man to retreat to Detroit, and finally,\r\nby advancing boldly against the slight fortifications of the post,\r\nfrightened him into surrender.  Hull had been set an impossible task,\r\nto conquer upper Canada with no sure means of getting reinforcements or\r\nsupplies through a region swarming with Indians; but his conduct\r\nindicated no spark of pugnacity, and his surrender caused the loss of\r\nthe entire north-west.  Tecumseh and his warriors now advanced against\r\nthe Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio frontiers; and the nameless horrors of\r\nIndian massacre and torture surged along the line of settlements.  The\r\nfrontiersmen flew to arms.  General Harrison, with a commission from\r\nKentucky, headed a large expedition to regain lost ground; but he only\r\nsucceeded in building forts in north-western Ohio and waging a\r\ndefensive war against the raids of Tecumseh and the British general,\r\nProctor, Brock's successor.\r\n\r\nAt Niagara, no move was made until the late autumn, when two American\r\ngenerals in succession--Van Rensselaer and Smyth--tried to lead a\r\nmotley array of militia and regulars across the river.  Brock met the\r\nfirst detachment and was killed in a skirmish, but his men were able to\r\nannihilate the main attack, on the brink of the river, while several\r\nthousand American militia, {222} refusing, on constitutional grounds,\r\nto serve outside the jurisdiction of their state, watched safely from\r\nthe eastern  bank.  The second effort in November, under General Smyth,\r\nproved an even worse fiasco.  Meanwhile General Dearborn, the supreme\r\ncommander, tried to invade near Lake Champlain;  but, after he had\r\nmarched his troops to the Canadian border, the militia refused to leave\r\nthe soil of the United States, and so the campaign had to be abandoned.\r\nThe military efforts of the United States were, as the Canadian\r\nhistorian phrases it, \"beneath criticism.\"\r\n\r\nThe only redeeming feature of the year was the record of the little\r\nAmerican navy and the success of the privateers, who rushed to prey\r\nupon British commerce.  Upwards of two hundred British vessels were\r\ncaptured, while all but about seventy American ships reached home\r\nsafely.  The British sent squadrons of cruisers, but were unable to\r\nbegin a blockade.  Their aim was to capture American men-of-war as\r\nrapidly as possible, to prevent their doing damage, so they\r\nunhesitatingly attacked American vessels whenever they met them,\r\nregardless of slight differences in size or gun-power.  The British\r\nsea-captain of the day had a hearty contempt for Americans, and never\r\ndreamed that their navy could be any more dangerous than the {223}\r\nFrench.  To the unlimited delight of the American public, and the\r\nstupefaction of England, five American cruisers in succession captured\r\nor sank five British in the autumn of 1812, utilizing superior weight\r\nof broadside and more accurate gunnery with merciless severity.  These\r\nblows did no actual damage to a navy which comprised several hundred\r\nfrigates and sloops, but the moral effect was great.  It had been\r\nproved that Americans, after all, could fight.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 there was a change in administrative officers.  Doctor Eustis\r\nwas replaced in the War Department by John Armstrong, who had served in\r\nthe Revolution, and William Jones of Philadelphia succeeded Paul\r\nHamilton as Secretary of the Navy.  Congress authorized more men, to\r\nthe number of 58,000, and more ships, and voted more loans.  Finally,\r\nin the summer it was actually driven to impose internal taxes like\r\nthose which, when imposed by Federalists, had savoured of tyranny.\r\n\r\nOn the northern frontier, renewed efforts were made to collect a real\r\narmy, and, with late comprehension of the necessities of the case,\r\nnaval officers were sent to build flotillas to control Erie, Ontario,\r\nand Champlain.  On their part, the British Ministry sent out a few\r\ntroops and officers to Canada, but {224} relied this year chiefly upon\r\na strict blockade, which was proclaimed first in December, 1812, and\r\nwas extended, before the end of the year, to cover the entire coast,\r\nexcept New England.  Ships-of-the-line, frigates, and sloops patrolled\r\nthe entrances to all the seaports, terminating not only foreign but\r\ncoastwise commerce.\r\n\r\nThings went little if any better for the United States.  The army was\r\non paper 58,000 men; but the people of the north and west would not\r\nenlist.  The utmost efforts at recruiting did not succeed in bringing\r\none-half the nominal force into the field.  The people would not take\r\nthe war seriously, and the administration was helpless.  To make\r\nmatters worse, not only did the north-western frontier agonize under\r\nIndian warfare, but the south-west became involved, when, in August,\r\n1813, the Creek Indians, affected by Tecumseh's influence, rose and\r\nbegan a war in Tennessee and Georgia.  For months Andrew Jackson,\r\nGeneral of Tennessee militia, with other local commanders, carried on\r\nan exhausting and murderous conflict in the swamps and woods of the\r\nsouth-west.  The war was now assuming the character of the last stand\r\nof the Indians before the oncoming whites.\r\n\r\nIn the north-west, decisive blows were struck in this year by General\r\nHarrison and {225} Commander Perry.  The latter built a small fleet of\r\nboats, carrying in all fifty-four guns, and sailed out to contest the\r\ncontrol of Lake Erie.  Captain Barclay, the British commander, with\r\nscantier resources, constructed a weaker fleet, with sixty-three\r\nlighter guns, and gallantly awaited the Americans on September 9.  In a\r\ndesperately fought battle, Perry's sloop, the _Lawrence_, was\r\npractically destroyed by the concentrated fire of the British; but the\r\ngreater gun-power of the Americans told, and the entire British\r\nflotilla was compelled to surrender.  This enabled Harrison, who had\r\nbeen waiting for months in his fortifications, to advance and pursue\r\nProctor into upper Canada.  On October 5 he brought him to action near\r\nthe river Thames, winning a complete victory and killing Tecumseh.  The\r\nAmericans then returned to Detroit, and the Indian war gradually\r\nsimmered down, until in August, 1814, the leading tribes made peace.\r\nTo the eastward no such decisive action took place.  Sir James Yeo and\r\nCommodore Chauncey, commanding the British and American vessels\r\nrespectively on Lake Ontario, were each unwilling to risk a battle\r\nwithout a decisive superiority; and the result was that no serious\r\nengagement occurred.  This rendered it impossible for either side to\r\nattain any military success in that region; and so the year 1813 {226}\r\nshows only a succession of raids, a species of activity in which the\r\nBritish proved much the more daring and efficient.  During one of these\r\naffairs, General Dearborn occupied the Canadian town of York, now\r\nToronto, and burned the public buildings--an act of needless\r\ndestruction for which the United States was destined to pay heavily.\r\nFurther eastward, General Wilkinson and General Hampton began a joint\r\ninvasion of lower Canada, Wilkinson leading a force of over 6,000 men\r\ndown the St. Lawrence, Hampton advancing with 4,000 from Lake Champlain\r\ntoward the same goal, Montreal.  But at Chrystler's Farm, on November\r\n11, the rearguard of Wilkinson's army suffered a thorough defeat at the\r\nhands of a small pursuing force; and Hampton underwent a similar\r\nrepulse from an inferior body of French-Canadians under Colonel de\r\nSalaberry, at Chateauguy, on October 25.  Finally, Hampton, suspecting\r\nthat Armstrong and Wilkinson intended in case of any failure to throw\r\nthe blame on him, decided to withdraw, November 11, and Wilkinson\r\nfollowed.  The whole invasion came to an inglorious conclusion.\r\n\r\nAt sea the uniform success of American cruisers came to a stop, for,\r\nout of four naval duels, two were British victories, notably the taking\r\nof the unlucky _Chesapeake_ by the {227} _Shannon_.  Only where\r\nprivateers and sloops swept West Indian waters and hung about British\r\nconvoys was there much to satisfy American feelings; and all the while\r\nthe blockading squadrons cruised at their ease in Chesapeake and\r\nDelaware bays and Long Island Sound.  The country was now subjected to\r\nincreasing distress from the stoppage of all commerce; not only was the\r\nFederal government sorely pinched from loss of tariff revenue, but the\r\nNew England towns suffered from starvation prices for food products,\r\nwhile in the middle and southern States grain was used to feed the\r\ncattle or allowed to rot.\r\n\r\nFor the season of 1814, it was necessary again to try to build up\r\narmies; and now the time was growing short during which the United\r\nStates could hope to draw advantage from the preoccupation of England\r\nin the European struggle.  During the winter of 1814, the final\r\ncrushing of Napoleon took place, ending with his abdication and the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons.  Simultaneously, the British campaign in\r\nSpain was carried to its triumphant conclusion, and after April British\r\narmies had no further European occupation.  Unless peace were made, or\r\nunless the United States gained such advantages in Canada as to render\r\nthe British ready to treat, it was practically certain that the {228}\r\nsummer would find the full power of the British army, as well as the\r\nnavy, in a position to be directed against the American frontier and\r\nthe American sea-coast.\r\n\r\nCongress, however, did nothing new.  It authorized a loan, raised the\r\nbounty for enlistments, voted a further increase of the army, and\r\nadjourned.  Armstrong, the Secretary of War, succeeded in replacing the\r\nworn-out veterans who had mismanaged the campaigns of 1812-1813 with\r\nfighting generals, younger men, such as Jacob Brown, Scott, Ripley, and\r\nJackson, the Indian fighter; but he could not induce men to enlist any\r\nmore freely, nor did he show any ability in planning operations.  So\r\nevents dragged on much as before.\r\n\r\nOn Lake Ontario, Chauncey and Yeo continued their cautious policy,\r\nbuilding vessels continually and never venturing out of port unless for\r\nthe moment in overwhelming force.  The result was that first one then\r\nthe other controlled the lake; but they never met.  The only serious\r\nfighting took place near Niagara, where General Brown, with a little\r\nforce of 2,600 men, tried to invade Canada, and was met first by\r\nGeneral Riall, and later by General Drummond, with practically equal\r\nforces.  Here the Americans actually fought, and fought hard, winning a\r\nslight success at Chippawa on July 5, and engaging {229} in a drawn\r\nbattle at Lundy's Lane on July 25.  Later forced to take refuge in Fort\r\nErie, Brown made a successful defence against Drummond, and obliged him\r\nto abandon an effort at siege.  Here, as in the naval combats, the\r\nmilitary showing of the Americans was at last creditable; but the\r\ncampaign was on too trivial a scale to produce any results.  In the\r\nsouth-west this year, Jackson pushed through his attack on the Creeks\r\nto a triumphant conclusion, and in spite of mutinous militia and\r\ndifficult forests compelled the Indians on August 9, 1814, to purchase\r\npeace by large cessions of land.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the summer, however, the British were ready to lay a\r\nheavy hand on the United States and punish the insolent country for its\r\nannoying attack in the rear.  New England was now subjected to the\r\nblockade, and troops from Wellington's irresistible army were sent\r\nacross, some to the squadron in the Chesapeake, others to Canada, and\r\nlater still others in a well-equipped expedition to New Orleans to\r\nconquer the mouth of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe Chesapeake squadron, after raiding and provisioning itself at the\r\nexpense of the Virginia and Maryland farmers, made a dash at\r\nWashington, sending boats up the Patuxent and Potomac rivers, and\r\nlanding a body of about 2,000 men.  On August 24, with absurd {230}\r\nease, this force scattered in swift panic a hasty collection of\r\nmilitia, and entered Washington, sending the President and Cabinet\r\nflying into the country.  In retaliation for the damage done at York,\r\nthe British officers set fire to the capital and other public\r\nbuildings, before retreating swiftly to their ships.  A similar attack\r\non Baltimore, September 11, was better met, and, although the British\r\nrouted a force of militia, the attempt to take the city was abandoned.\r\nThe humiliation of the capture of Washington led to the downfall of\r\nArmstrong as Secretary of State, although not until after he had almost\r\nruined another campaign.\r\n\r\nWhile the British were threatening Washington, another force was\r\ngathering north of Lake Champlain, and a large frigate was being built\r\nto secure command of that lake.  By the end of August, nearly 16,000\r\nmen, most of them from Wellington's regiments, were assembled to invade\r\nNew York, probably with the intention of securing the permanent\r\noccupation of the northern part.  In the face of this, Armstrong sent\r\nmost of the American troops at Plattsburg on a useless march across New\r\nYork State, leaving a bare handful under General McComb to meet the\r\ninvasion.  When Sir George Prevost, Governor-General of Canada,\r\nadvanced to Plattsburg on September 6, he found nothing {231} but\r\nmilitia and volunteers before him.  Fortunately for the United States,\r\nPrevost was no fighter, and he declined to advance or attack unless he\r\nhad a naval control of the lake.  On September 11 the decisive contest\r\ntook place.  McDonough, the American commander, with a small squadron,\r\nentirely defeated and captured the British flotilla under Downie.  It\r\nwas Lake Erie over again, with the difference that in this battle the\r\nAmerican fleet was not superior to the British.  It was a victory due\r\nto better planning and better gunnery, and it led to the immediate\r\nretreat of Prevost, who tamely abandoned the whole campaign, to the\r\nintense mortification of his officers and men.  The remaining\r\nexpedition, under General Pakenham, comprising 16,000 Peninsular\r\nveterans, under convoy of a strong fleet, sailed to the Gulf of Mexico\r\nand advanced to capture New Orleans.  General Andrew Jackson was at\r\nhand, and with him a mass of militia and frontiersmen.  Driven by the\r\nfurious energy of the Indian fighter, the Americans showed\r\naggressiveness and courage in skirmishes and night attacks, and finally\r\nwon an astounding victory on January 8, 1815.  On that day the British\r\nforce tried to storm, by frontal attack, a line of intrenchments armed\r\nwith cannon and packed with riflemen.  In twenty-five minutes their\r\ncolumns were so badly cut up by {232} grapeshot and musketry that the\r\nwhole attack was abandoned, after Pakenham himself had been killed.\r\nThe expedition withdrew, and sailing to Mobile, a town in Spanish\r\nterritory, occupied by the Americans, retook it on February 11; but the\r\nmain purpose of their invasion was foiled.\r\n\r\nIn this year, while American land forces struggled to escape\r\ndestruction, the naval vessels were for the most part shut in by the\r\nblockade.  Occasional captures were still made in single combat; but\r\nBritish frigates were now under orders to refuse battle with the larger\r\nAmerican vessels, and the captures by sloops were counterbalanced by\r\nthe British capture of the frigate _Essex_ by two antagonists in March,\r\n1814.  Practically the only extensive operations carried on were by\r\nAmerican privateers, who now haunted the British Channel and captured\r\nmerchantmen within sight of the English coasts.  The irritation caused\r\nby these privateers was excessive, and made British shipowners and\r\nmerchants anxious for peace; but it had no effect on the military\r\nsituation.  England was not to be subdued by mere annoyance.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1814, the time seemed to be at hand when the United\r\nStates must submit to peace on such terms as England chose to dictate,\r\nor risk disruption and ruin.  The administrative weaknesses of the\r\ncountry {233} culminated in actual financial bankruptcy, which was due\r\nin no small part to the fact that Federalist financiers and bankers,\r\ndetermining to do all the damage possible, steadily refused to\r\nsubscribe to the loans or to give any assistance.  The powerful New\r\nEngland capital was entirely withheld.  The result was that the strain\r\non the rest of the banks became too great; and after the capture of\r\nWashington they all suspended specie payment, leaving the Government\r\nonly the notes of suspended banks, or its own depreciated treasury\r\nnotes for currency.  All the coin in the country steadily flowed into\r\nthe vaults of New England banks, while the Federal Treasury was\r\ncompelled, on November 9, 1814, to admit its inability to pay interest\r\non its loans.  Congress met in the autumn and endeavoured to remedy the\r\nsituation by chartering a bank; but under the general suspension of\r\nspecie payments it was impossible to start one solvent from the\r\nbeginning.  When Congress authorized one without power to suspend\r\nspecie payments, Madison vetoed it as useless.  All that could be done\r\nwas to issue more treasury notes.  As for the army, a Bill for\r\ncompulsory service was brought in, showing the enormous change in\r\nRepublican ideals; but it failed to pass.  Congress seemed helpless.\r\nThe American people would neither enlist for the war nor {234}\r\nauthorize their representatives to pass genuine war measures.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists, controlling most of the New England States, now felt\r\nthat the time had come to insist on a termination of their grievances.\r\nTheir governors had refused to allow militia to assist, their\r\nlegislatures had done nothing to aid the war; their capitalists had\r\ndeclined to subscribe, and their farmers habitually sold provisions to\r\nthe British over the Canadian boundary, actually supplying Sir George\r\nPrevost's army by contract.  There met, at Hartford, on December 14,\r\n1814, a convention of leading men, officially or unofficially\r\nrepresenting the five New England States, who agreed upon a document\r\nwhich was intended to secure the special rights of their region.  They\r\ndemanded amendments to the Constitution abolishing the reckoning of\r\nslaves as basis for congressional representation, providing for the\r\npartial distribution of government revenues among the States,\r\nprohibiting embargoes or commercial warfare, or the election of\r\nsuccessive Presidents from the same State, and requiring a two-thirds\r\nvote of Congress to admit new States or declare war.  This was meant\r\nfor an ultimatum; and it was generally understood that, if the Federal\r\ngovernment did not submit to these terms, the New England States would\r\nsecede to {235} rid themselves of what they considered the intolerable\r\noppression of Virginian misgovernment.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things in the winter of 1815.  The administration\r\nof Madison had utterly failed to secure any of the ends of the war, to\r\ninflict punishment on Great Britain, or to conquer Canada.  It had also\r\nutterly failed to maintain financial solvency, to enlist an army, to\r\ncreate a navy capable of keeping the sea, or to prevent a movement in\r\nNew England which seemed to be on the verge of breaking the country\r\ninto pieces.  But to lay this miserable failure--for such only can it\r\nbe called--to the personal discredit of Jefferson and Madison is\r\nunfair, for it was only the repetition under new governmental\r\nconditions of the old traditional colonial method of carrying on war as\r\na local matter.  The French and Indian War, the Revolution, and the War\r\nof 1812, repeated in different generations the same tale of amateur\r\nwarfare, of the occasional success and usual worthlessness of the\r\nmilitia, the same administrative inefficiency, and the same financial\r\nbreakdown.  Without authority and obedience, there can be carried on no\r\nreal war; and authority and obedience were no more known and no better\r\nappreciated in 1812 than they had been in the days of Washington.\r\nJefferson, Madison, {236} and their party had gone with the current of\r\nAmerican tradition; that was their only fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nEND OF THE ANTAGONISM: A CENTURY OF PEACE\r\n\r\nWhen the American war began, the English showed a tendency to blame the\r\nTory administration for permitting it to take place; but the chief\r\nfeeling, after all, was one of annoyance at Madison and his party for\r\nhaving decided to give their assistance to Napoleon at the crisis of\r\nhis career.  The intercourse between Englishmen and New England\r\nFederalists had given British society its understanding of American\r\npolitics and coloured its natural irritation toward the Republican\r\nadministration with something of the deeper venom of the outraged New\r\nEnglanders, who saw in Jefferson and his successors a race of\r\nhalf-Jacobins.  During 1812 and 1813, accordingly, newspapers and\r\nministerial speakers, when they referred to the contest, generally\r\nspoke of the necessity of {237} chastising an impudent and presumptuous\r\nantagonist.  A friendly party such as had defended the colonists during\r\nthe Revolution no longer existed, for the Whigs, however antagonistic\r\nto the Liverpool Ministry, were fully as firmly committed to\r\nmaintaining British naval and commercial supremacy.\r\n\r\nEngland's chief continental ally, however, the Tsar Alexander,\r\nconsidered the American war an unfortunate blunder; and, as early as\r\nSeptember, 1812, he offered his mediation through young John Quincy\r\nAdams, Minister at St. Petersburg.  The news reached America in March,\r\n1813, and Madison revealed his willingness to withdraw from a contest\r\nalready shown to be unprofitable by immediately accepting and\r\nnominating Adams, with Bayard and Gallatin, to serve as peace\r\ncommissioners.  Without waiting to hear from England, these envoys\r\nstarted for Russia, but reached there only to meet an official refusal\r\non the part of England, dated July 5, 1813.  The Liverpool Ministry did\r\nnot wish to have the American war brought within the range of European\r\nconsideration, since its settlement under such circumstances might\r\nraise questions of neutral rights which would be safer out of the hands\r\nof a Tsar whose predecessors had framed armed neutralities in 1780 and\r\n1801.  Accordingly, the British government intimated politely that\r\n{238} it would be willing to deal directly with the United States, and\r\nthus waved the unwelcome Russian mediation aside.  Madison accepted\r\nthis offer in March, 1814; but, although the American commissioners\r\nendeavoured through Alexander Baring, their friend and defender in\r\nParliament, to get the British government to appoint a time and place\r\nfor meeting, they encountered continued delays.\r\n\r\nA considerable element in the Tory party felt that the time had come to\r\ninflict a severe punishment upon the United States, and newspapers and\r\nspeakers of that connection announced freely that only by large\r\nconcessions of territory could the contemptible republic purchase\r\npeace.  When the Ministry finally sent commissioners to Ghent, on\r\nAugust 8, 1814, it was not with any expectation of coming to a prompt\r\nagreement, but merely to engage the Americans while the various\r\nexpeditions then under way took Washington and Baltimore, occupied\r\nnorthern New York, and captured New Orleans.  It was generally expected\r\nthat a few months would find large portions of the United States in\r\nBritish possession, as was in fact the sea-coast of Maine, east of\r\nPenobscot Bay, after September first.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to the British peace commissioners were based on the\r\n_uti possedetis_, {239} as the British government intended it to be by\r\nthe end of the year, when they expected to hold half of Maine, the\r\nnorthern parts of New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, the\r\nnorth-western post of Mackinnac, and possibly New Orleans and Mobile.\r\nIn addition, there was to be an Indian territory established under\r\nBritish guarantee west of the old treaty line of 1795, and all American\r\nfishing rights were to be terminated.  On the other side, the American\r\ninstructions, while hinting that England would do well to cede Canada,\r\nmade the abandonment of the alleged right of impressments by England a\r\n_sine quâ non_.  Clearly no agreement between such points of view was\r\npossible; and the outcome of the negotiation was bound to depend on the\r\ncourse of events in the United States.  The first interviews resulted\r\nin revealing that part of the British instructions related to the\r\nIndian territory with intimations of coming demands for territorial\r\ncessions.  This the Americans instantly rejected on August 25, and the\r\nnegotiation came to a standstill for several weeks.\r\n\r\nThe three British negotiators, Admiral Gambier, Henry Goulburn, and\r\nDoctor Adams were men of slight political or personal authority, and\r\ntheir part consisted chiefly in repeating their instructions and\r\nreferring American replies back to Lord Castlereagh, {240} the Foreign\r\nSecretary, or to Lord Bathurst, who acted as his substitute while he\r\nattended the Congress of Vienna.  The American commissioners, including\r\nthe three original ones, Adams, Bayard, and Gallatin, to whom Clay and\r\nRussell of Massachusetts were now added, clearly understood the\r\nsituation, and had already warned Madison that an insistence on the\r\nabandonment of impressments would result in the failure to secure any\r\ntreaty.  In October, 1814, a despatch yielded this point and left the\r\nnegotiators to make the best fight they could, unhampered by positive\r\ninstructions.  Undoubtedly they would have been compelled to submit to\r\nhard terms, in spite of their personal ability, which stood exceedingly\r\nhigh, had not news of the repulse at Baltimore, of the treaty of July,\r\n1814, by which the north-western Indians agreed to fight the English,\r\nand, on October 17, of the retreat of Sir George Prevost after the\r\ndefeat of Plattsburg, come in to change the situation.\r\n\r\nBetween August and October little had been accomplished, during a slow\r\ninterchange of notes, beyond a withdrawal by the British of their\r\ndemand for an Indian territory, and an acceptance in its place of an\r\nagreement to include the Indians in a general peace.  Then the Cabinet,\r\nseeing that after Prevost's retreat they could no longer claim the\r\n{241} territory outlined in the first instructions, authorized the\r\nnegotiators to demand only Mackinac and Niagara, with a right of way\r\nacross Maine.  The Americans, encouraged by the news from Plattsburg,\r\nreplied on October 23, refusing to treat on the _uti possedetis_, or on\r\nany terms but the _status quo ante_.  This brought the Tory government\r\nface to face with the question whether the war was to be continued for\r\nanother year for the purpose of conquering a frontier for Canada; and,\r\nbefore the prospect of continued war taxation, annoyance from\r\nprivateers, and a doubtful outcome, they hesitated.  Turning to\r\nWellington for a decision, they asked him whether he would accept the\r\ncommand in America for the purpose of conquering a peace.  His reply\r\nshowed little interest or desire to go, although he seemed confident of\r\nsuccess; but he observed that, on the basis of the military situation,\r\nthey had no right to demand any territorial cession.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry then, on November 18, definitely abandoned the claim for\r\ncompensation, and accepted as a basis for discussion a plan submitted\r\nby the American commissioners.  In the preparation of this a sharp\r\nquarrel had broken out between Clay, who insisted on terminating the\r\nBritish right to navigate the Mississippi, and Adams, who {242}\r\ndemanded the retention of the American right to fish in Canadian\r\nwaters.  Gallatin pointed out that the two privileges stood together,\r\nand with great difficulty he induced the two men to agree to the\r\nomission of both matters from the treaty, although Clay refused until\r\nthe last to sign.  So the commission presented a united front in\r\noffering to renew both rights or postpone them for discussion; and the\r\nBritish commissioners finally accepted the latter alternative.  The\r\ntreaty was then signed in the old Carthusian Convent at Ghent, on\r\nDecember 24, 1814, as a simple cessation of hostilities and return to\r\nthe _status quo ante_ as regards conquests.  Not a word related to any\r\nof the numerous causes of the war.  Impressments, blockades, Orders in\r\nCouncil, the Indian relations, the West Indian trade rights,--all were\r\nabandoned.  So far as the United States was concerned the treaty was an\r\nacknowledgment of defeat, a recognition that the war was a failure.\r\n\r\nIn view of the hopes of Canadian gains, the treaty was denounced in\r\nEngland by the Opposition journals and many of those most antagonistic\r\nto America as a cowardly surrender.  But it was none the less heartily\r\naccepted by both peoples and both governments.  It reached the United\r\nStates on February 11, was sent to the Senate on February 15, and\r\nratified unanimously the next day.  There {243} still remained various\r\nvessels at sea, and so the winter of 1815 saw not only the amazing\r\nvictory of Jackson at New Orleans, but also several naval actions, in\r\nwhich the United States frigate _President_ was taken by a squadron of\r\nBritish blockades, two American sloops in duels took two British\r\nsmaller vessels, and the American _Constitution_, in a night action,\r\ncaptured, together, two British sloops.  Then the news spread, and\r\npeace finally arrived in fact.\r\n\r\nIn England, the whole affair was quickly forgotten in the tremendous\r\nexcitement caused by the return of Napoleon from Elba, the uprising of\r\nEurope, and the dramatic meeting of the two great captains, Wellington\r\nand Napoleon, in the Waterloo campaign.  By the time the Napoleonic\r\nEmpire had finally collapsed, the story of the American war, with its\r\nmaritime losses and scanty land triumphs, was an old one, and the\r\nBritish exporters, rushing to regain their former markets, were happy\r\nin the prospect of the reopening of American ports.  By October, trade\r\nrelations were re-established and the solid intercourse of the two\r\ncountries was under way.\r\n\r\nIn America all disgraces and defeats were forgotten in the memories of\r\nNew Orleans, Plattsburg, and Chippawa, and the people at large, willing\r\nto forgive all its failures to the {244} Republican administration,\r\nresumed with entire contentment the occupations of peace.  The war\r\nfabric melted like a cloud; armies were disbanded, vessels were called\r\nhome, credit rose, prices sprang upward, importations swelled,\r\nexportation began.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the time of antagonism was at an end, for, with the European\r\npeace of 1814, the immediate cause for irritation was removed, never to\r\nreturn.  The whole structure of blockades, Orders in Council, seizures,\r\nand restrictions upon neutrals vanished; the necessity for British\r\nimpressments ceased to exist; and, since France never again came into\r\nhostility with England, none of these grievances were revived.  But in\r\na broader way the year 1815 and the decades following marked the end of\r\nnational hostility, for the fundamental antagonisms which, since 1763,\r\nhad repeatedly brought about irritation and conflict, began after this\r\ntime to die out.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the defeat of the Indians in the war allowed the\r\npeople of the United States to advance unchecked into the north-west\r\nand south-west, filling the old Indian lands, and rendering any\r\ncontinuation of the restrictive diplomacy on the part of England for\r\nthe benefit of Canadian fur traders patently futile.  The war was no\r\nsooner ended than roads, trails, and rivers swarmed {245} with\r\nwestward-moving emigrants; and within a year the territory of Indiana,\r\nwhich the British commissioners at Ghent had wished to establish as an\r\nIndian reserve, was framing a State constitution.  In 1819 Illinois\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe revulsion of temper was illustrated in the commencement at this\r\ntime of the organized movement for settled international peace, which\r\nmay be dated from the establishment of the New York and Massachusetts\r\nPeace Societies in 1815, and the London Peace Society in the following\r\nyear.  But its most signal expression came in the remarkable agreement\r\nby which the Canadian-American frontier has been, for nearly a century,\r\nunfortified, and yet completely peaceful.  On November 16, 1815, State\r\nSecretary Monroe instructed Adams to propose to the British Government\r\nthat--as, \"if each party augments its force there with a view to\r\nobtaining the ascendancy over the other, vast expense will be incurred\r\nand the danger of collision augmented in like degree\"--such military\r\npreparations should be suspended on both sides.  The smaller the number\r\nof the armed forces agreed upon, he said, the better; \"or to abstain\r\naltogether from an armed force beyond that used for the revenue.\"\r\nAfter some suspicious hesitation, Lord Castlereagh accepted this novel\r\nproposal; and it was {246} given effect to by an exchange of notes,\r\nsigned by Mr. Bagot, British Minister at Washington, and Mr. Rush\r\n(Monroe's successor) on April 28 and 29, 1817, approved by the Senate a\r\nyear later, and proclaimed by the President on April 28, 1818.  By\r\nRush-Bagot Agreement, the naval force of each Government was limited to\r\none small gun-boat of each power on Champlain and Ontario, and two on\r\nthe upper lakes, an arrangement of immense value to both Canada and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe old-time commercial antagonism was also destined to disappear in a\r\nfew years after the close of the war.  At first England clung to the\r\ntime-honoured West Indian policy, and, when in 1815 the two countries\r\nadjusted their commercial relations, American vessels were still\r\nexcluded, although given the right to trade directly with the East\r\nIndies.  But already the new economic thought, which regarded\r\ncompetition and reciprocal trade as the ideal, instead of legal\r\ndiscriminations and universal protectionism, was gaining ground, as\r\nEngland became more and more the manufacturing centre of the world.\r\nUnder Huskisson, in 1825, reciprocity was definitely substituted for\r\nexclusion; and a few years later, under Peel and Russell, and within\r\nthe lifetime of men who had maintained the Orders in Council, the whole\r\n{247} elaborate system of laws backed by the logic of Lord Sheffield\r\nand James Stephen was cast away and fell into disrepute and oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn America, it should be added, the rush of settlers into the West and\r\nthe starting of manufactures served, within a few years from the end of\r\nthe War of 1812, to alter largely the former dependence of the United\r\nStates upon foreign commerce.  By the time that England was ready to\r\nabandon its restrictive policy, the United States was beginning to be a\r\nmanufacturing nation with its chief wealth in its great internal trade,\r\nand the ancient interest in the West Indies was fast falling into\r\ninsignificance.  The same men who raged against the Jay treaty and the\r\nOrders in Council lived to forget that they had ever considered the\r\nWest India trade important.  So, on both sides, the end of commercial\r\nantagonism was soon to follow on the Treaty of Ghent.\r\n\r\nFinally, and more slowly, the original political and social antagonism\r\nceased to be active, and ultimately died out.  So far as the United\r\nStates was concerned, the change was scarcely visible until\r\nthree-quarters of a century after the Treaty of Ghent.  The temper of\r\nthe American people, formed by Revolutionary traditions and nourished\r\non memories of battle and injuries, remained {248} steadily\r\nantagonistic toward England; and the triumph of western social ideals\r\nserved to emphasize the distinction between the American democrat and\r\nthe British aristocrat, until dislike became a tradition and a\r\npolitical and literary convention.  But the emptiness of this normal\r\nnational hatred of John Bull was shown in 1898, when, at the first\r\ndistinct sign of friendliness on the part of the British government and\r\npeople, the whole American anglophobia vanished, and the people of the\r\ncontinent realized that the time had come for a recognition of the\r\nessential and normal harmony of the ancient enemies.\r\n\r\nIn England, the change began somewhat earlier, for within less than a\r\ngeneration after the Treaty of Ghent the exclusive Tory control\r\ncollapsed, and the Revolution of 1832 gave the middle classes a share\r\nof political power.  A few years later the Radicals, representing the\r\nworking-men, became a distinct force in Parliament, and to middle class\r\nand Radicals there was nothing abhorrent in the American Republic.\r\nAristocratic society continued, of course, as in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, to regard the United States with scant respect, and those\r\nmembers of the upper middle classes who took their social tone from the\r\naristocracy commonly reflected their prejudices.  But the masses of\r\n{249} the British people--whose relatives emigrated steadily to the\r\nwestern land of promise--felt a genuine sympathy and interest in the\r\nsuccess of the great democratic experiment, a sympathy which was far\r\ndeeper and more effective than had been that of the eighteenth-century\r\nWhigs.  From the moment that these classes made their weight felt in\r\ngovernment, the time was at hand when the old social antagonism was to\r\ndie out, and with it the deep political antipathy which, since the days\r\nof 1793, had tinged the official British opinion of a democratic state.\r\nThe last evidence of the Tory point of view came when, in 1861, the\r\nAmerican Civil War brought out the unconcealed aversion of the British\r\nnobility and aristocracy for the northern democracy; but on the\r\noccasion the equally unconcealed sense of political and social sympathy\r\nmanifested by the British middle and working classes served to prevent\r\nany danger to the United States, and to keep England from aiding in the\r\ndisruption of the Union.\r\n\r\nThus the Treaty of Ghent, marking the removal of immediate causes of\r\nirritation, was the beginning of a period in which the under-lying\r\nelements of antagonism between England and the United States were\r\ndefinitely to cease.  When every discount is made, the celebration,\r\nheartily supported by the national leaders on {250} both sides, of a\r\ncentury of peace between the British, Canadian, and American peoples,\r\ndoes exhibit, in Sir Wilfred Laurier's words, \"a spectacle to astound\r\nthe world by its novelty and grandeur.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{251}\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nThe references to the epoch covered in this volume may be rather\r\nsharply divided into those which deal with the years before 1783, and\r\nthose which relate to the subsequent period.  In the first group, there\r\nare both British and American works of high excellence, but in the\r\nsecond there are practically none but American authorities, owing to\r\nthe preoccupation of British writers with the more dramatic and\r\nimportant French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, of the events of\r\nparliamentary politics.\r\n\r\nFor the years 1763-1783 the best American history is E. CHANNING,\r\n_History of the United States_, vol. iii (1912), distinctly\r\nindependent, thorough, and impartial.  S. G. FISHER, _The Struggle for\r\nAmerican Independence_, 2 vols. (1908), is cynically critical and\r\nunconventional.  Three volumes of the _American Nation_ series,--G. E.\r\nHOWARD, _Preliminaries of the Revolution_; C. H. VAN TYNE, _The\r\nAmerican Revolution_; and A. C. McLAUGHLIN, _The Confederation and the\r\nConstitution_ (1905), are equally scholarly and less detailed.  The\r\nolder American works, exhibiting the traditional \"patriotic\" view, are\r\nbest represented by J. FISKE, _American Revolution_, 2 vols. (1891);\r\nand G. BANCROFT, _History of the United States_, 6 vols. (ed.\r\n1883-1885).\r\n\r\nOn the English side the most valuable study is in W. E. H. LECKY,\r\n_England in the Eighteenth Century_, vols. iii, iv (1878), a\r\npenetrating and impartial analysis.  The Whig view appears in SIR G. O.\r\nTREVELYAN, _The American Revolution_, 3 vols. (1899-1907); LORD MAHON,\r\n_England in the Eighteenth Century_, vols. v-vii (1853-1854); and M.\r\nMARKS, _England and America_, 2 vols. (1907), while W. HUNT, _Political\r\nHistory_, 1760-1801 (1905), alone of recent writers, presents a Tory\r\nversion of events.\r\n\r\nSpecial works of value are C. STEDMAN, _The American War_, 2 vols.\r\n(1794), the authoritative English contemporary account of military\r\nevents, and, among recent studies, J. W. FORTESCUE, _History of the\r\nBritish Army_, vol. iii (1902), which should be compared with H. B.\r\nCARRINGTON, _Battles of the Revolution_ (1876); E. MCCRADY, _South\r\nCarolina in the Revolution_, 2 vols. (1901-2); E. J. LOWELL, _The\r\nHessians in the {252} Revolution_ (1884); J. B. PERKINS, _France in the\r\nAmerican Revolution_ (1911); C. H. VAN TYNE, _The Loyalists_ (1902),\r\nand W. HERTZ, _The Old Colonial System_ (1905).  Of especial value are\r\nthe destructive criticisms in C. F. ADAMS, _Studies Military and\r\nDiplomatic_ (1911).  The authoritative treatment of naval history is\r\nfound in A. T. MAHAN, _Influence of Sea Power_ (1890), and in the\r\nchapter by the same writer in W. L. CLOWES, _History of the Royal\r\nNavy_, vols. iii, iv (1898-1899).\r\n\r\nAmong leading biographies are those of Washington by H. C. LODGE (2\r\nvols. 1890), by W. C. FORD (2 vols.  1900), and by GEN. B. T. JOHNSON\r\n(1894); of Franklin by J. PARTON (2 vols. 1864), by J. BIGELOW (3 vols.\r\n1874), and by J. T. MORSE (1889); of Henry by M. C. TYLER (1887); of\r\nSamuel Adams by J. K. HOSMER (1885); of Robert Morris by E. P.\r\nOBERHOLZER (1903), and of Steuben by F. KAPP (1869).  On the English\r\nside the _Memoirs of Horace Walpole_ (1848); the _Correspondence of\r\nGeorge III with Lord North_, ed. by W. B. DONNE (1867), are valuable\r\nand interesting, and some material may be found in the lives of Burke\r\nby T. McNIGHT (2 vols. 1858); of Shelburne by E. G. FITZMAURICE (2\r\nvols. 1875); of Chatham by F. HARRISON (1905) and A. VON RUVILLE (3\r\nvols. 1907); and of Fox by LORD JOHN RUSSELL (3 vols. 1859).  The\r\nbiographies of two governors of Massachusetts, C. A. POWNALL, _Thomas\r\nPownall_ (1908), and J. K. HOSMER, _Thomas Hutchinson_ (1896), are of\r\nvalue as presenting the colonial Tory point of view.\r\n\r\nFor the period after 1783, the best reference book and the only one\r\nwhich attempts to trace in detail the motives of British as well as\r\nAmerican statesmen is HENRY ADAMS, _History of the United States_, 9\r\nvols. (1891).  It is impartially critical, in a style of sustained and\r\ncaustic vivacity.  Almost equally valuable is A. T. MAHAN, _Sea Power\r\nin Relation to the War of 1812_, 2 vols. (1905), which contains the\r\nonly sympathetic analysis of British naval and commercial policy,\r\n1783-1812, beside being the authoritative work on naval events.  The\r\nstandard American works are J. SCHOULER, _History of the United\r\nStates_, vols. i, ii (1882); J. B. MCMASTER, _History of the People of\r\nthe United States_, vols. i-iv (1883-1895); R. HILDRETH, _History of\r\nthe United States_, vols. ii-vi (1849-1862), and three volumes of the\r\n_American Nation Series_, J. S. BASSETT, _The Federalist System_; E.\r\nCHANNING, _The Jeffersonian System_, and K. C. BABCOCK, _Rise of\r\nAmerican Nationality_ (1906).  On the English side there is little in\r\nthe general histories beyond a chapter on American relations in A.\r\nALISON, _Modern Europe_, vol. iv (1848), which accurately represents\r\nthe extreme Tory contempt for the United States, but has no other\r\nmerit.  Works on Canadian history fill this {253} gap to a certain\r\nextent, such as W. KINGSFORD, _History of Canada_, vol. viii (1895).\r\n\r\nBeside the work of Mahan (as above) the War of 1812 is dealt with by W.\r\nJAMES, _Naval History of Great Britain_, vols. v-vi (1823), a work of\r\naccuracy as to British facts, but of violent anti-American temper; and\r\non the other side by J. F. COOPER, _Naval History_ (1856), and T.\r\nROOSEVELT, _Naval War of 1812_ (1883).  Sundry special works dealing\r\nwith economic and social questions involved in international relations\r\nare T. ROOSEVELT, _Winning of the West_, 4 vols. (1899-1902); W.\r\nCUNNINGHAM, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, vol. iii (1893),\r\nand W. SMART, _Economic Annals of the Nineteenth Century_ (1910).\r\nBiographical material is to be found, in the lives of Washington (as\r\nabove); of Jefferson by J. SCHOULER, (1897), and by J. T. MORSE (1883);\r\nof Hamilton by J. T. MORSE (1882), and F. S. OLIVER (1907); of Gallatin\r\nby H. ADAMS (1879); of Madison by G. HUNT (1903); of Josiah Quincy by\r\nE. QUINCY (1869).  There is some biographical material to be found in\r\nBROUGHAM'S _Life and Times of Lord Brougham_, vol. iii (1872), and in\r\nS. WALPOLE, _Life of Spencer Perceval_, 2 vols. (1874), but for the\r\nmost part the British version of relations with America after 1783 is\r\nstill to be discovered only in the contemporary sources such as the\r\n_Parliamentary History_ and _Debates_, the _Annual Register_, and the\r\npartly published papers of such leaders as Pitt, Fox, Grenville,\r\nCanning, Castlereagh and Perceval.\r\n\r\nA useful sketch, giving prominence to the Treaty of Ghent and the\r\nRush-Bagot Agreement, and summarizing earlier and later events, is _A\r\nShort History of Anglo-American Relations and of the Hundred Years'\r\nPeace_, by H. S. PERRIS.\r\n\r\nDocuments and other contemporary material for the whole period may be\r\nconveniently found in W. MACDONALD, _Select Charters_ (1904) and\r\n_Select Documents_ (1898); in G. CALLENDER, _Economic History of the\r\nUnited States_ (1909), and A. B. HART, _American History told by\r\nContemporaries_, vols. ii, iii (1898, 1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  {254}\r\n\r\n  INDEX\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, in Revolution, 48, 57, 63, 71, 118-125;\r\n    after 1783, 142, 147, 155, 173-180\r\n  Adams, John Quincy, 237-241\r\n  Adams, Samuel, 32, 42, 50, 57, 63, 78, 131, 144\r\n  Adet, P.
