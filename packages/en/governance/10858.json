Richardson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Jackson was born in the Waxhaw Settlement, North or South\r\nCarolina, on the 15th of March, 1767. He was a son of Andrew Jackson, an\r\nIrishman, who emigrated to America in 1765 and died in 1767. The name of\r\nhis mother was Elizabeth Hutchinson. There is little definite\r\ninformation about the schools that he attended. According to Parton, \"He\r\nlearned to read, to write, and cast accounts--little more.\" Having taken\r\narms against the British in 1781, he was captured, and afterwards\r\nwounded by an officer because he refused to clean the officer's boots.\r\nAbout 1785 he began to study law at Salisbury, N.C. In 1788 removed to\r\nNashville, Tenn., where he began to practice law. About 1791 he married\r\nRachel Robards, originally Rachel Donelson, whose first husband was\r\nliving and had taken preliminary measures to obtain a divorce, which was\r\nlegally completed in 1793. The marriage ceremony was again performed in\r\n1794. He was a member of the convention which framed the constitution of\r\nTennessee in 1796, and in the autumn of that year was elected\r\nRepresentative to Congress by the people of Tennessee, which State was\r\nthen entitled to only one member. Supported Thomas Jefferson in the\r\nPresidential election of 1796. In 1797 became a Senator of the United\r\nStates for the State of Tennessee. Resigned his seat in the Senate in\r\n1798; was a judge of the supreme court of Tennessee from 1798 till 1804.\r\nAfter war had been declared against Great Britain, General Jackson (who\r\nseveral years before had been appointed major-general of militia)\r\noffered his services and those of 2,500 volunteers in June, 1812. He was\r\nordered to New Orleans, and led a body of 2,070 men in that direction;\r\nbut at Natchez he received an order, dated February 6, 1813, by which\r\nhis troops were dismissed from public service. In October, 1813, he took\r\nthe field against the Creek Indians, whom he defeated at Talladega in\r\nNovember. By his services in this Creek war, which ended in 1814, he\r\nacquired great popularity, and in May, 1814, was appointed a\r\nmajor-general in the Regular Army; was soon afterwards ordered to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, to oppose an expected invasion of the British. In\r\nNovember he seized Pensacola, which belonged to Spain, but was used by\r\nthe British as a base of operations. About the 1st of December he moved\r\nhis army to New Orleans, where he was successful in two engagements with\r\nthe British, and afterwards gained his famous victory on January 8,\r\n1815. This was the last battle of the war, a treaty of peace having been\r\nsigned on December 24, 1814. In 1817-18 he waged a successful war\r\nagainst the Seminoles in Florida, seized Pensacola, and executed\r\nArbuthnot and Ambrister, two British subjects, accused of inciting the\r\nsavages to hostile acts against the Americans. He was appointed governor\r\nof Florida in 1821. In 1823 was elected a Senator of the United States,\r\nand nominated as candidate for the Presidency by the legislature of\r\nTennessee. His competitors were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and\r\nWilliam H. Crawford. Jackson received 99 electoral votes, Adams 84,\r\nCrawford 41, and Clay 37. As no candidate had a majority, the election\r\ndevolved on the House of Representatives, and it resulted in the choice\r\nof Mr. Adams. In 1828 Jackson was elected President, receiving 178\r\nelectoral votes, while Adams received 83; was reelected in 1832,\r\ndefeating Henry Clay. Retired to private life March 4, 1837. He died at\r\nthe Hermitage on the 8th of June, 1845, and was buried there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT ELECT.\r\n\r\nCITY OF WASHINGTON, _March 2, 1829._\r\nJ.C. CALHOUN,\r\n_Vice-President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSir: Through you I beg leave to inform the Senate that on Wednesday, the\r\n4th instant, at 12 o'clock, I shall be ready to take the oath prescribed\r\nby the Constitution previously to entering on a discharge of my official\r\nduties, and at such place as the Senate may think proper to designate.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens: About to undertake the arduous duties that I have been\r\nappointed to perform by the choice of a free people, I avail myself of\r\nthis customary and solemn occasion to express the gratitude which their\r\nconfidence inspires and to acknowledge the accountability which my\r\nsituation enjoins. While the magnitude of their interests convinces me\r\nthat no thanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred, it\r\nadmonishes me that the best return I can make is the zealous dedication\r\nof my humble abilities to their service and their good.\r\n\r\nAs the instrument of the Federal Constitution it will devolve on me for\r\na stated period to execute the laws of the United States, to superintend\r\ntheir foreign and their confederate relations, to manage their revenue,\r\nto command their forces, and, by communications to the Legislature, to\r\nwatch over and to promote their interests generally. And the principles\r\nof action by which I shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duties\r\nit is now proper for me briefly to explain.\r\n\r\nIn administering the laws of Congress I shall keep steadily in view the\r\nlimitations as well as the extent of the Executive power, trusting\r\nthereby to discharge the functions of my office without transcending its\r\nauthority. With foreign nations it will be my study to preserve peace\r\nand to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms, and in the\r\nadjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the\r\nforbearance becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility\r\nbelonging to a gallant people.\r\n\r\nIn such measures as I may be called on to pursue in regard to the rights\r\nof the separate States I hope to be animated by a proper respect for\r\nthose sovereign members of our Union, taking care not to confound the\r\npowers they have reserved to themselves with those they have granted to\r\nthe Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe management of the public revenue--that searching operation in all\r\ngovernments--is among the most delicate and important trusts in ours,\r\nand it will, of course, demand no inconsiderable share of my official\r\nsolicitude. Under every aspect in which it can be considered it would\r\nappear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and\r\nfaithful economy. This I shall aim at the more anxiously both because it\r\nwill facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt, the unnecessary\r\nduration of which is incompatible with real independence, and because it\r\nwill counteract that tendency to public and private profligacy which a\r\nprofuse expenditure of money by the Government is but too apt to\r\nengender. Powerful auxiliaries to the attainment of this desirable end\r\nare to be found in the regulations provided by the wisdom of Congress\r\nfor the specific appropriation of public money and the prompt\r\naccountability of public officers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view\r\nto revenue, it would seem to me that the spirit of equity, caution, and\r\ncompromise in which the Constitution was formed requires that the great\r\ninterests of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures should be equally\r\nfavored, and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist\r\nin the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may\r\nbe found essential to our national independence.\r\n\r\nInternal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge, so far as they can\r\nbe promoted by the constitutional acts of the Federal Government, are of\r\nhigh importance.\r\n\r\nConsidering standing armies as dangerous to free governments in time of\r\npeace, I shall not seek to enlarge our present establishment, nor\r\ndisregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teaches\r\nthat the military should be held subordinate to the civil power. The\r\ngradual increase of our Navy, whose flag has displayed in distant climes\r\nour skill in navigation and our fame in arms; the preservation of our\r\nforts, arsenals, and dockyards, and the introduction of progressive\r\nimprovements in the discipline and science of both branches of our\r\nmilitary service are so plainly prescribed by prudence that I should be\r\nexcused for omitting their mention sooner than for enlarging on their\r\nimportance. But the bulwark of our defense is the national militia,\r\nwhich in the present state of our intelligence and population must\r\nrender us invincible. As long as our Government is administered for the\r\ngood of the people, and is regulated by their will; as long as it\r\nsecures to us the rights of person and of property, liberty of\r\nconscience and of the press, it will be worth defending; and so long as\r\nit is worth defending a patriotic militia will cover it with an\r\nimpenetrable aegis. Partial injuries and occasional mortifications we\r\nmay be subjected to, but a million of armed freemen, possessed of the\r\nmeans of war, can never be conquered by a foreign foe. To any just\r\nsystem, therefore, calculated to strengthen this natural safeguard of\r\nthe country I shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power.\r\n\r\nIt will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the Indian\r\ntribes within our limits a just and liberal policy, and to give that\r\nhumane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which\r\nis consistent with the habits of our Government and the feelings of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on the list of\r\nExecutive duties, in characters too legible to be overlooked, the task\r\nof _reform_, which will require particularly the correction of those\r\nabuses that have brought the patronage of the Federal Government into\r\nconflict with the freedom of elections, and the counteraction of those\r\ncauses which have disturbed the rightful course of appointment and have\r\nplaced or continued power in unfaithful or incompetent hands.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of a task thus generally delineated I shall endeavor\r\nto select men whose diligence and talents will insure in their\r\nrespective stations able and faithful cooperation, depending for the\r\nadvancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the\r\npublic officers than on their numbers.\r\n\r\nA diffidence, perhaps too just, in my own qualifications will teach me\r\nto look with reverence to the examples of public virtue left by my\r\nillustrious predecessors, and with veneration to the lights that flow\r\nfrom the mind that founded and the mind that reformed our system. The\r\nsame diffidence induces me to hope for instruction and aid from the\r\ncoordinate branches of the Government, and for the indulgence and\r\nsupport of my fellow-citizens generally. And a firm reliance on the\r\ngoodness of that Power whose providence mercifully protected our\r\nnational infancy, and has since upheld our liberties in various\r\nvicissitudes, encourages me to offer up my ardent supplications that He\r\nwill continue to make our beloved country the object of His divine care\r\nand gracious benediction.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 6, 1829_.\r\n_the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The Executive nominations made during the past session of\r\nCongress, and which remain unacted on by the Senate, I hereby withdraw\r\nfrom their consideration.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 6, 1829_.\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty of commerce and navigation concluded at Washington on the 1st\r\nof May, 1828, between the United States and the King of Prussia, was\r\nlaid before the Senate, who, by their resolution of the 14th of that\r\nmonth, advised and consented to its ratification by the President.\r\n\r\nBy the sixteenth article of that treaty it was agreed that the exchange\r\nof ratifications should be made within nine months from its date.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th day of February last, being fifteen days after the time\r\nstipulated for the exchange by the terms of the treaty, the chargé\r\nd'affaires of the King of Prussia informed the Secretary of State that\r\nhe had received the Prussian ratification and was ready to exchange it\r\nfor that of the United States. In reply he was informed of the intention\r\nof the President, my late predecessor, not to proceed to the exchange in\r\nconsequence of the expiration of the time within which it was to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have thought it my duty, in order to avoid\r\nall future questions, to ask the advice and consent of the Senate to\r\nmake the proposed exchange.\r\n\r\nI send you the original of the treaty, together with a printed copy of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 11, 1829_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Brevet rank for ten years' faithful service has produced much\r\nconfusion in the Army. For this reason the discretion vested in the\r\nPresident of the United States on this subject would not be exercised by\r\nany submission of those cases to the Senate but that it has been\r\nheretofore the practice to do so. They are accordingly submitted, with\r\nother nominations, to fill the offices respectively annexed to their\r\nnames in the inclosed lists,[1] for the consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\nBy the President of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 7th of\r\nJanuary, 1824, entitled \"An act concerning discriminating duties of\r\ntonnage and impost,\" it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence\r\nbeing given to the President of the United States by the government of\r\nany foreign nation that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost\r\nare imposed or levied within the ports of the said nation upon vessels\r\nbelonging wholly to citizens of the United States, or upon merchandise\r\nthe produce or manufacture thereof imported in the same, the President\r\nis thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the\r\nforeign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United\r\nStates are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects\r\nthe vessels of the said nation and the merchandise of its produce or\r\nmanufacture imported into the United States in the same, the said\r\nsuspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given\r\nto the President of the United States and to continue so long as the\r\nreciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United\r\nStates, and merchandise, as aforesaid, therein laden, shall be\r\ncontinued, and no longer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has been received by me from His Imperial\r\nMajesty the Emperor of Austria, through the Baron de Lederer, his\r\nconsul-general in the United States, that vessels wholly belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States are not, nor shall be, on their entering\r\nany Austrian port, from and after the 1st day of January last, subject\r\nto the payment of higher duties of tonnage than are levied on Austrian\r\nships:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts\r\nimposing duties on the tonnage of ships arriving in the United States as\r\nimposed a discriminating duty between the vessels of the Empire of\r\nAustria and vessels of the United States are suspended and discontinued,\r\nthe said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned and to\r\ncontinue henceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels\r\nof the United States shall be continued in the ports of the imperial\r\ndominions of Austria.\r\n\r\n(SEAL.)\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 11th day of May,\r\nA.D. 1829, and the fifty-second[2] of the Independence of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\nM. Van Buren,\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Should be \"third\" instead of \"second.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of\r\nMay, 1828, entitled \"An act in addition to an act entitled 'An act\r\nconcerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost,' and to equalize\r\nthe duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes,\" it is provided that\r\nupon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United\r\nStates by the government of any foreign nation that no discriminating\r\nduties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the\r\nsaid nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United\r\nStates, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in\r\nthe same from the United States or from any foreign country, the\r\nPresident is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that\r\nthe foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the\r\nUnited States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as\r\nrespects the vessels of the said foreign nation and the produce,\r\nmanufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States in the same\r\nfrom the said foreign nation or from any other foreign country, the said\r\nsuspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given\r\nto the President of the United States and to continue so long as the\r\nreciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United\r\nStates, and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no\r\nlonger; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me from His\r\nImperial Majesty the Emperor of Austria, through an official\r\ncommunication of the Baron de Lederer, his consul-general in the United\r\nStates, under date of the 29th of May, 1829, that no other or higher\r\nduties of tonnage and impost are imposed or levied since the 1st day of\r\nJanuary last in the ports of Austria upon vessels wholly belonging to\r\ncitizens of the United States and upon the produce, manufactures, or\r\nmerchandise imported in the same from the United States and from any\r\nforeign country whatever than are levied on Austrian ships and their\r\ncargoes in the same ports under like circumstances:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several acts\r\nimposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United\r\nStates are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects\r\nthe vessels of Austria and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise\r\nimported into the United States in the same from the dominions of\r\nAustria and from any other foreign country whatever, the said suspension\r\nto take effect from the day above mentioned and to continue\r\nthenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the\r\nUnited States and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported\r\ninto the dominions of Austria in the same, as aforesaid, shall be\r\ncontinued on the part of the Government of His Imperial Majesty the\r\nEmperor of Austria.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 3d day of June,\r\nA.D. 1829, and the fifty-third of the Independence of the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\nM. VAN BUREN,\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\nIn all applications by any invalid to obtain a pension in consequence of\r\nany disability incurred, no payment therefor shall commence until proof\r\nshall be filed in the Department and the decision of the Secretary had\r\nthereon; and no pension will be allowed to anyone while acting as an\r\nofficer of the Army except in cases which have been heretofore adjudged.\r\n\r\nApproved, 8th April, 1829.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt affords me pleasure to tender my friendly greetings to you on the\r\noccasion of your assembling at the seat of Government to enter upon the\r\nimportant duties to which you have been called by the voice of our\r\ncountrymen. The task devolves on me, under a provision of the\r\nConstitution, to present to you, as the Federal Legislature of\r\ntwenty-four sovereign States and 12,000,000 happy people, a view of our\r\naffairs, and to propose such measures as in the discharge of my official\r\nfunctions have suggested themselves as necessary to promote the objects\r\nof our Union.\r\n\r\nIn communicating with you for the first time it is to me a source of\r\nunfeigned satisfaction, calling for mutual gratulation and devout thanks\r\nto a benign Providence, that we are at peace with all mankind, and that\r\nour country exhibits the most cheering evidence of general welfare and\r\nprogressive improvement. Turning our eyes to other nations, our great\r\ndesire is to see our brethren of the human race secured in the blessings\r\nenjoyed by ourselves, and advancing in knowledge, in freedom, and in\r\nsocial happiness.\r\n\r\nOur foreign relations, although in their general character pacific and\r\nfriendly, present subjects of difference between us and other powers of\r\ndeep interest as well to the country at large as to many of our\r\ncitizens. To effect an adjustment of these shall continue to be the\r\nobject of my earnest endeavors, and notwithstanding the difficulties of\r\nthe task, I do not allow myself to apprehend unfavorable results.\r\nBlessed as our country is with everything which constitutes national\r\nstrength, she is fully adequate to the maintenance of all her interests.\r\nIn discharging the responsible trust confided to the Executive in this\r\nrespect it is my settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly\r\nright and to submit to nothing that is wrong; and I flatter myself that,\r\nsupported by the other branches of the Government and by the\r\nintelligence and patriotism of the people, we shall be able, under the\r\nprotection of Providence, to cause all our just rights to be respected.\r\n\r\nOf the unsettled matters between the United States and other powers, the\r\nmost prominent are those which have for years been the subject of\r\nnegotiation with England, France, and Spain. The late periods at which\r\nour ministers to those Governments left the United States render it\r\nimpossible at this early day to inform you of what has been done on the\r\nsubjects with which they have been respectively charged. Relying upon\r\nthe justice of our views in relation to the points committed to\r\nnegotiation and the reciprocal good feeling which characterizes our\r\nintercourse with those nations, we have the best reason to hope for a\r\nsatisfactory adjustment of existing differences.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain, alike distinguished in peace and war, we may look\r\nforward to years of peaceful, honorable, and elevated competition.\r\nEverything in the condition and history of the two nations is calculated\r\nto inspire sentiments of mutual respect and to carry conviction to the\r\nminds of both that it is their policy to preserve the most cordial\r\nrelations. Such are my own views, and it is not to be doubted that such\r\nare also the prevailing sentiments of our constituents. Although neither\r\ntime nor opportunity has been afforded for a full development of the\r\npolicy which the present cabinet of Great Britain designs to pursue\r\ntoward this country, I indulge the hope that it will be of a just and\r\npacific character; and if this anticipation be realized we may look with\r\nconfidence to a speedy and acceptable adjustment of our affairs.\r\n\r\nUnder the convention for regulating the reference to arbitration of the\r\ndisputed points of boundary under the fifth article of the treaty of\r\nGhent, the proceedings have hitherto been conducted in that spirit of\r\ncandor and liberality which ought ever to characterize the acts of\r\nsovereign States seeking to adjust by the most unexceptionable means\r\nimportant and delicate subjects of contention. The first statements of\r\nthe parties have been exchanged, and the final replication on our part\r\nis in a course of preparation. This subject has received the attention\r\ndemanded by its great and peculiar importance to a patriotic member of\r\nthis Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe exposition of our rights already made is such as, from the high\r\nreputation of the commissioners by whom it has been prepared, we had a\r\nright to expect. Our interests at the Court of the Sovereign who has\r\nevinced his friendly disposition by assuming the delicate task of\r\narbitration have been committed to a citizen of the State of Maine,\r\nwhose character, talents, and intimate acquaintance with the subject\r\neminently qualify him for so responsible a trust. With full confidence\r\nin the justice of our cause and in the probity, intelligence, and\r\nuncompromising independence of the illustrious arbitrator, we can have\r\nnothing to apprehend from the result.\r\n\r\nFrom France, our ancient ally, we have a right to expect that justice\r\nwhich becomes the sovereign of a powerful, intelligent, and magnanimous\r\npeople. The beneficial effects produced by the commercial convention of\r\n1822, limited as are its provisions, are too obvious not to make a\r\nsalutary impression upon the minds of those who are charged with the\r\nadministration of her Government. Should this result induce a\r\ndisposition to embrace to their full extent the wholesome principles\r\nwhich constitute our commercial policy, our minister to that Court will\r\nbe found instructed to cherish such a disposition and to aid in\r\nconducting it to useful practical conclusions. The claims of our\r\ncitizens for depredations upon their property, long since committed\r\nunder the authority, and in many instances by the express direction, of\r\nthe then existing Government of France, remain unsatisfied, and must\r\ntherefore continue to furnish a subject of unpleasant discussion and\r\npossible collision between the two Governments. I cherish, however, a\r\nlively hope, founded as well on the validity of those claims and the\r\nestablished policy of all enlightened governments as on the known\r\nintegrity of the French Monarch, that the injurious delays of the past\r\nwill find redress in the equity of the future. Our minister has been\r\ninstructed to press these demands on the French Government with all the\r\nearnestness which is called for by their importance and irrefutable\r\njustice, and in a spirit that will evince the respect which is due to\r\nthe feelings of those from whom the satisfaction is required.\r\n\r\nOur minister recently appointed to Spain has been authorized to assist\r\nin removing evils alike injurious to both countries, either by\r\nconcluding a commercial convention upon liberal and reciprocal terms or\r\nby urging the acceptance in their full extent of the mutually beneficial\r\nprovisions of our navigation acts. He has also been instructed to make a\r\nfurther appeal to the justice of Spain, in behalf of our citizens, for\r\nindemnity for spoliations upon our commerce committed under her\r\nauthority--an appeal which the pacific and liberal course observed on\r\nour part and a due confidence in the honor of that Government authorize\r\nus to expect will not be made in vain.\r\n\r\nWith other European powers our intercourse is on the most friendly\r\nfooting. In Russia, placed by her territorial limits, extensive\r\npopulation, and great power high in the rank of nations, the United\r\nStates have always found a steadfast friend. Although her recent\r\ninvasion of Turkey awakened a lively sympathy for those who were exposed\r\nto the desolations of war, we can not but anticipate that the result\r\nwill prove favorable to the cause of civilization and to the progress of\r\nhuman happiness. The treaty of peace between these powers having been\r\nratified, we can not be insensible to the great benefit to be derived by\r\nthe commerce of the United States from unlocking the navigation of the\r\nBlack Sea, a free passage into which is secured to all merchant vessels\r\nbound to ports of Russia under a flag at peace with the Porte. This\r\nadvantage, enjoyed upon conditions by most of the powers of Europe, has\r\nhitherto been withheld from us. During the past summer an antecedent but\r\nunsuccessful attempt to obtain it was renewed under circumstances which\r\npromised the most favorable results. Although these results have\r\nfortunately been thus in part attained, further facilities to the\r\nenjoyment of this new field for the enterprise of our citizens are, in\r\nmy opinion, sufficiently desirable to insure to them our most zealous\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nOur trade with Austria, although of secondary importance, has been\r\ngradually increasing, and is now so extended as to deserve the fostering\r\ncare of the Government. A negotiation, commenced and nearly completed\r\nwith that power by the late Administration, has been consummated by a\r\ntreaty of amity, navigation, and commerce, which will be laid before the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nDuring the recess of Congress our diplomatic relations with Portugal\r\nhave been resumed. The peculiar state of things in that country caused a\r\nsuspension of the recognition of the representative who presented\r\nhimself until an opportunity was had to obtain from our official organ\r\nthere information regarding the actual and, as far as practicable,\r\nprospective condition of the authority by which the representative in\r\nquestion was appointed. This information being received, the application\r\nof the established rule of our Government in like cases was no longer\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\nConsiderable advances have been made during the present year in the\r\nadjustment of claims of our citizens upon Denmark for spoliations, but\r\nall that we have a right to demand from that Government in their behalf\r\nhas not yet been conceded. From the liberal footing, however, upon which\r\nthis subject has, with the approbation of the claimants, been placed by\r\nthe Government, together with the uniformly just and friendly\r\ndisposition which has been evinced by His Danish Majesty, there is a\r\nreasonable ground to hope that this single subject of difference will\r\nspeedily be removed.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Barbary Powers continue, as they have long been,\r\nof the most favorable character. The policy of keeping an adequate force\r\nin the Mediterranean, as security for the continuance of this\r\ntranquillity, will be persevered in, as well as a similar one for the\r\nprotection of our commerce and fisheries in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe southern Republics of our own hemisphere have not yet realized all\r\nthe advantages for which they have been so long struggling. We trust,\r\nhowever, that the day is not distant when the restoration of peace and\r\ninternal quiet, under permanent systems of government, securing the\r\nliberty and promoting the happiness of the citizens, will crown with\r\ncomplete success their long and arduous efforts in the cause of\r\nself-government, and enable us to salute them as friendly rivals in all\r\nthat is truly great and glorious.\r\n\r\nThe recent invasion of Mexico, and the effect thereby produced upon her\r\ndomestic policy, must have a controlling influence upon the great\r\nquestion of South American emancipation. We have seen the fell spirit of\r\ncivil dissension rebuked, and perhaps forever stifled, in that Republic\r\nby the love of independence. If it be true, as appearances strongly\r\nindicate, that the spirit of independence is the master spirit, and if a\r\ncorresponding sentiment prevails in the other States, this devotion to\r\nliberty can not be without a proper effect upon the counsels of the\r\nmother country. The adoption by Spain of a pacific policy toward her\r\nformer colonies--an event consoling to humanity, and a blessing to the\r\nworld, in which she herself can not fail largely to participate--may be\r\nmost reasonably expected.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens upon the South American Governments generally\r\nare in a train of settlement, while the principal part of those upon\r\nBrazil have been adjusted, and a decree in council ordering bonds to be\r\nissued by the minister of the treasury for their amount has received the\r\nsanction of His Imperial Majesty. This event, together with the exchange\r\nof the ratifications of the treaty negotiated and concluded in 1828,\r\nhappily terminates all serious causes of difference with that power.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to place our commercial relations with Peru\r\nupon a better footing than that upon which they have hitherto rested,\r\nand if met by a proper disposition on the part of that Government\r\nimportant benefits may be secured to both countries.\r\n\r\nDeeply interested as we are in the prosperity of our sister Republics,\r\nand more particularly in that of our immediate neighbor, it would be\r\nmost gratifying to me were I permitted to say that the treatment which\r\nwe have received at her hands has been as universally friendly as the\r\nearly and constant solicitude manifested by the United States for her\r\nsuccess gave us a right to expect. But it becomes my duty to inform you\r\nthat prejudices long indulged by a portion of the inhabitants of Mexico\r\nagainst the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States have had an unfortunate influence upon the affairs of the\r\ntwo countries, and have diminished that usefulness to his own which was\r\njustly to be expected from his talents and zeal. To this cause, in a\r\ngreat degree, is to be imputed the failure of several measures equally\r\ninteresting to both parties, but particularly that of the Mexican\r\nGovernment to ratify a treaty negotiated and concluded in its own\r\ncapital and under its own eye. Under these circumstances it appeared\r\nexpedient to give to Mr. Poinsett the option either to return or not, as\r\nin his judgment the interest of his country might require, and\r\ninstructions to that end were prepared; but before they could be\r\ndispatched a communication was received from the Government of Mexico,\r\nthrough its chargé d'affaires here, requesting the recall of our\r\nminister. This was promptly complied with, and a representative of a\r\nrank corresponding with that of the Mexican diplomatic agent near this\r\nGovernment was appointed. Our conduct toward that Republic has been\r\nuniformly of the most friendly character, and having thus removed the\r\nonly alleged obstacle to harmonious intercourse, I can not but hope that\r\nan advantageous change will occur in our affairs.\r\n\r\nIn justice to Mr. Poinsett it is proper to say that my immediate\r\ncompliance with the application for his recall and the appointment of a\r\nsuccessor are not to be ascribed to any evidence that the imputation of\r\nan improper interference by him in the local politics of Mexico was well\r\nfounded, nor to a want of confidence in his talents or integrity, and to\r\nadd that the truth of that charge has never been affirmed by the federal\r\nGovernment of Mexico in its communications with this.\r\n\r\nI consider it one of the most urgent of my duties to bring to your\r\nattention the propriety of amending that part of our Constitution which\r\nrelates to the election of President and Vice-President. Our system of\r\ngovernment was by its framers deemed an experiment, and they therefore\r\nconsistently provided a mode of remedying its defects.\r\n\r\nTo the people belongs the right of electing their Chief Magistrate; it\r\nwas never designed that their choice should in any case be defeated,\r\neither by the intervention of electoral colleges or by the agency\r\nconfided, under certain contingencies, to the House of Representatives.\r\nExperience proves that in proportion as agents to execute the will of\r\nthe people are multiplied there is danger of their wishes being\r\nfrustrated. Some may be unfaithful; all are liable to err. So far,\r\ntherefore, as the people can with convenience speak, it is safer for\r\nthem to express their own will.\r\n\r\nThe number of aspirants to the Presidency and the diversity of the\r\ninterests which may influence their claims leave little reason to expect\r\na choice in the first instance, and in that event the election must\r\ndevolve on the House of Representatives, where it is obvious the will of\r\nthe people may not be always ascertained, or, if ascertained, may not be\r\nregarded. From the mode of voting by States the choice is to be made by\r\n24 votes, and it may often occur that one of these will be controlled by\r\nan individual Representative. Honors and offices are at the disposal of\r\nthe successful candidate. Repeated ballotings may make it apparent that\r\na single individual holds the cast in his hand. May he not be tempted to\r\nname his reward? But even without corruption, supposing the probity of\r\nthe Representative to be proof against the powerful motives by which it\r\nmay be assailed, the will of the people is still constantly liable to be\r\nmisrepresented. One may err from ignorance of the wishes of his\r\nconstituents; another from a conviction that it is his duty to be\r\ngoverned by his own judgment of the fitness of the candidates; finally,\r\nalthough all were inflexibly honest, all accurately informed of the\r\nwishes of their constituents, yet under the present mode of election a\r\nminority may often elect a President, and when this happens it may\r\nreasonably be expected that efforts will be made on the part of the\r\nmajority to rectify this injurious operation of their institutions. But\r\nalthough no evil of this character should result from such a perversion\r\nof the first principle of our system--_that the majority is to\r\ngovern_--it must be very certain that a President elected by a minority\r\ncan not enjoy the confidence necessary to the successful discharge of\r\nhis duties.\r\n\r\nIn this as in all other matters of public concern policy requires that\r\nas few impediments as possible should exist to the free operation of the\r\npublic will. Let us, then, endeavor so to amend our system that the\r\noffice of Chief Magistrate may not be conferred upon any citizen but in\r\npursuance of a fair expression of the will of the majority.\r\n\r\nI would therefore recommend such an amendment of the Constitution as may\r\nremove all intermediate agency in the election of the President and\r\nVice-President. The mode may be so regulated as to preserve to each\r\nState its present relative weight in the election, and a failure in the\r\nfirst attempt may be provided for by confining the second to a choice\r\nbetween the two highest candidates. In connection with such an amendment\r\nit would seem advisable to limit the service of the Chief Magistrate to\r\na single term of either four or six years. If, however, it should not be\r\nadopted, it is worthy of consideration whether a provision disqualifying\r\nfor office the Representatives in Congress on whom such an election may\r\nhave devolved would not be proper.\r\n\r\nWhile members of Congress can be constitutionally appointed to offices\r\nof trust and profit it will be the practice, even under the most\r\nconscientious adherence to duty, to select them for such stations as\r\nthey are believed to be better qualified to fill than other citizens;\r\nbut the purity of our Government would doubtless be promoted by their\r\nexclusion from all appointments in the gift of the President, in whose\r\nelection they may have been officially concerned. The nature of the\r\njudicial office and the necessity of securing in the Cabinet and in\r\ndiplomatic stations of the highest rank the best talents and political\r\nexperience should, perhaps, except these from the exclusion.\r\n\r\nThere are, perhaps, few men who can for any great length of time enjoy\r\noffice and power without being more or less under the influence of\r\nfeelings unfavorable to the faithful discharge of their public duties.\r\nTheir integrity may be proof against improper considerations immediately\r\naddressed to themselves, but they are apt to acquire a habit of looking\r\nwith indifference upon the public interests and of tolerating conduct\r\nfrom which an unpracticed man would revolt. Office is considered as a\r\nspecies of property, and government rather as a means of promoting\r\nindividual interests than as an instrument created solely for the\r\nservice of the people. Corruption in some and in others a perversion of\r\ncorrect feelings and principles divert government from its legitimate\r\nends and make it an engine for the support of the few at the expense of\r\nthe many. The duties of all public officers are, or at least admit of\r\nbeing made, so plain and simple that men of intelligence may readily\r\nqualify themselves for their performance; and I can not but believe that\r\nmore is lost by the long continuance of men in office than is generally\r\nto be gained by their experience. I submit, therefore, to your\r\nconsideration whether the efficiency of the Government would not be\r\npromoted and official industry and integrity better secured by a general\r\nextension of the law which limits appointments to four years.\r\n\r\nIn a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the\r\npeople no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than\r\nanother. Offices were not established to give support to particular men\r\nat the public expense. No individual wrong is, therefore, done by\r\nremoval, since neither appointment to nor continuance in office is\r\nmatter of right. The incumbent became an officer with a view to public\r\nbenefits, and when these require his removal they are not to be\r\nsacrificed to private interests. It is the people, and they alone, who\r\nhave a right to complain when a bad officer is substituted for a good\r\none. He who is removed has the same means of obtaining a living that are\r\nenjoyed by the millions who never held office. The proposed limitation\r\nwould destroy the idea of property now so generally connected with\r\nofficial station, and although individual distress may be sometimes\r\nproduced, it would, by promoting that rotation which constitutes a\r\nleading principle in the republican creed, give healthful action to the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nNo very considerable change has occurred during the recess of Congress\r\nin the condition of either our agriculture, commerce, or manufactures.\r\nThe operation of the tariff has not proved so injurious to the two\r\nformer or as beneficial to the latter as was anticipated. Importations\r\nof foreign goods have not been sensibly diminished, while domestic\r\ncompetition, under an illusive excitement, has increased the production\r\nmuch beyond the demand for home consumption. The consequences have been\r\nlow prices, temporary embarrassment, and partial loss. That such of our\r\nmanufacturing establishments as are based upon capital and are prudently\r\nmanaged will survive the shock and be ultimately profitable there is no\r\ngood reason to doubt.\r\n\r\nTo regulate its conduct so as to promote equally the prosperity of these\r\nthree cardinal interests is one of the most difficult tasks of\r\nGovernment; and it may be regretted that the complicated restrictions\r\nwhich now embarrass the intercourse of nations could not by common\r\nconsent be abolished, and commerce allowed to flow in those channels to\r\nwhich individual enterprise, always its surest guide, might direct it.\r\nBut we must ever expect selfish legislation in other nations, and are\r\ntherefore compelled to adapt our own to their regulations in the manner\r\nbest calculated to avoid serious injury and to harmonize the conflicting\r\ninterests of our agriculture, our commerce, and our manufactures. Under\r\nthese impressions I invite your attention to the existing tariff,\r\nbelieving that some of its provisions require modification.\r\n\r\nThe general rule to be applied in graduating the duties upon articles of\r\nforeign growth or manufacture is that which will place our own in fair\r\ncompetition with those of other countries; and the inducements to\r\nadvance even a step beyond this point are controlling in regard to those\r\narticles which are of primary necessity in time of war. When we reflect\r\nupon the difficulty and delicacy of this operation, it is important that\r\nit should never be attempted but with the utmost caution. Frequent\r\nlegislation in regard to any branch of industry, affecting its value,\r\nand by which its capital may be transferred to new channels, must always\r\nbe productive of hazardous speculation and loss.\r\n\r\nIn deliberating, therefore, on these interesting subjects local feelings\r\nand prejudices should be merged in the patriotic determination to\r\npromote the great interests of the whole. All attempts to connect them\r\nwith the party conflicts of the day are necessarily injurious, and\r\nshould be discountenanced. Our action upon them should be under the\r\ncontrol of higher and purer motives. Legislation subjected to such\r\ninfluences can never be just, and will not long retain the sanction of a\r\npeople whose active patriotism is not bounded by sectional limits nor\r\ninsensible to that spirit of concession and forbearance which gave life\r\nto our political compact and still sustains it. Discarding all\r\ncalculations of political ascendency, the North, the South, the East,\r\nand the West should unite in diminishing any burthen of which either may\r\njustly complain.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural interest of our country is so essentially connected\r\nwith every other and so superior in importance to them all that it is\r\nscarcely necessary to invite to it your particular attention. It is\r\nprincipally as manufactures and commerce tend to increase the value of\r\nagricultural productions and to extend their application to the wants\r\nand comforts of society that they deserve the fostering care of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the period, not far distant, when a sinking fund will\r\nno longer be required, the duties on those articles of importation which\r\ncan not come in competition with our own productions are the first that\r\nshould engage the attention of Congress in the modification of the\r\ntariff. Of these, tea and coffee are the most prominent. They enter\r\nlargely into the consumption of the country, and have become articles of\r\nnecessity to all classes. A reduction, therefore, of the existing duties\r\nwill be felt as a common benefit, but like all other legislation\r\nconnected with commerce, to be efficacious and not injurious it should\r\nbe gradual and certain.\r\n\r\nThe public prosperity is evinced in the increased revenue arising from\r\nthe sales of the public lands and in the steady maintenance of that\r\nproduced by imposts and tonnage, notwithstanding the additional duties\r\nimposed by the act of 19th May, 1828, and the unusual importations in\r\nthe early part of that year.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on January 1, 1829, was $5,972,435.81. The\r\nreceipts of the current year are estimated at $24,602,230 and the\r\nexpenditures for the same time at $26,164,595, leaving a balance in the\r\nTreasury on the 1st of January next of $4,410,070.81.\r\n\r\nThere will have been paid on account of the public debt during the\r\npresent year the sum of $12,405,005.80, reducing the whole debt of the\r\nGovernment on the 1st of January next to $48,565,406.50, including seven\r\nmillions of 5 per cent stock subscribed to the Bank of the United\r\nStates. The payment on account of public debt made on the 1st of July\r\nlast was $8,715,462.87. It was apprehended that the sudden withdrawal of\r\nso large a sum from the banks in which it was deposited, at a time of\r\nunusual pressure in the money market, might cause much injury to the\r\ninterests dependent on bank accommodations. But this evil was wholly\r\naverted by an early anticipation of it at the Treasury, aided by the\r\njudicious arrangements of the officers of the Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\nThis state of the finances exhibits the resources of the nation in an\r\naspect highly flattering to its industry and auspicious of the ability\r\nof Government in a very short time to extinguish the public debt. When\r\nthis shall be done our population will be relieved from a considerable\r\nportion of its present burthens, and will find not only new motives to\r\npatriotic affection, but additional means for the display of individual\r\nenterprise. The fiscal power of the States will also be increased, and\r\nmay be more extensively exerted in favor of education and other public\r\nobjects, while ample means will remain in the Federal Government to\r\npromote the general weal in all the modes permitted to its authority.\r\n\r\nAfter the extinction of the public debt it is not probable that any\r\nadjustment of the tariff upon principles satisfactory to the people of\r\nthe Union will until a remote period, if ever, leave the Government\r\nwithout a considerable surplus in the Treasury beyond what may be\r\nrequired for its current service. As, then, the period approaches when\r\nthe application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease, the\r\ndisposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious\r\ndeliberation of Congress; and it may be fortunate for the country that\r\nit is yet to be decided. Considered in connection with the difficulties\r\nwhich have heretofore attended appropriations for purposes of internal\r\nimprovement, and with those which this experience tells us will\r\ncertainly arise whenever power over such subjects may be exercised by\r\nthe General Government, it is hoped that it may lead to the adoption of\r\nsome plan which will reconcile the diversified interests of the States\r\nand strengthen the bonds which unite them. Every member of the Union, in\r\npeace and in war, will be benefited by the improvement of inland\r\nnavigation and the construction of highways in the several States. Let\r\nus, then, endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be\r\nsatisfactory to all. That hitherto adopted has by many of our\r\nfellow-citizens been deprecated as an infraction of the Constitution,\r\nwhile by others it has been viewed as inexpedient. All feel that it has\r\nbeen employed at the expense of harmony in the legislative councils.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these evils it appears to me that the most safe, just, and\r\nfederal disposition which could be made of the surplus revenue would be\r\nits apportionment among the several States according to their ratio of\r\nrepresentation, and should this measure not be found warranted by the\r\nConstitution that it would be expedient to propose to the States an\r\namendment authorizing it. I regard an appeal to the source of power in\r\ncases of real doubt, and where its exercise is deemed indispensable to\r\nthe general welfare, as among the most sacred of all our obligations.\r\nUpon this country more than any other has, in the providence of God,\r\nbeen cast the special guardianship of the great principle of adherence\r\nto written constitutions. If it fail here, all hope in regard to it will\r\nbe extinguished. That this was intended to be a government of limited\r\nand specific, and not general, powers must be admitted by all, and it is\r\nour duty to preserve for it the character intended by its framers. If\r\nexperience points out the necessity for an enlargement of these powers,\r\nlet us apply for it to those for whose benefit it is to be exercised,\r\nand not undermine the whole system by a resort to overstrained\r\nconstructions. The scheme has worked well. It has exceeded the hopes of\r\nthose who devised it, and become an object of admiration to the world.\r\nWe are responsible to our country and to the glorious cause of\r\nself-government for the preservation of so great a good. The great mass\r\nof legislation relating to our internal affairs was intended to be left\r\nwhere the Federal Convention found it--in the State governments. Nothing\r\nis clearer, in my view, than that we are chiefly indebted for the\r\nsuccess of the Constitution under which we are now acting to the\r\nwatchful and auxiliary operation of the State authorities. This is not\r\nthe reflection of a day, but belongs to the most deeply rooted\r\nconvictions of my mind. I can not, therefore, too strongly or too\r\nearnestly, for my own sense of its importance, warn you against all\r\nencroachments upon the legitimate sphere of State sovereignty. Sustained\r\nby its healthful and invigorating influence the federal system can never\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of the revenue the long credits authorized on goods\r\nimported from beyond the Cape of Good Hope are the chief cause of the\r\nlosses at present sustained. If these were shortened to six, nine, and\r\ntwelve months, and warehouses provided by Government sufficient to\r\nreceive the goods offered in deposit for security and for debenture, and\r\nif the right of the United States to a priority of payment out of the\r\nestates of its insolvent debtors were more effectually secured, this\r\nevil would in a great measure be obviated. An authority to construct\r\nsuch houses is therefore, with the proposed alteration of the credits,\r\nrecommended to your attention.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that the laws for the collection and security of\r\nthe revenue arising from imposts were chiefly framed when the rates of\r\nduties on imported goods presented much less temptation for illicit\r\ntrade than at present exists. There is reason to believe that these laws\r\nare in some respects quite insufficient for the proper security of the\r\nrevenue and the protection of the interests of those who are disposed to\r\nobserve them. The injurious and demoralizing tendency of a successful\r\nsystem of smuggling is so obvious as not to require comment, and can not\r\nbe too carefully guarded against. I therefore suggest to Congress the\r\npropriety of adopting efficient measures to prevent this evil, avoiding,\r\nhowever, as much as possible, every unnecessary infringement of\r\nindividual liberty and embarrassment of fair and lawful business.\r\n\r\nOn an examination of the records of the Treasury I have been forcibly\r\nstruck with the large amount of public money which appears to be\r\noutstanding. Of the sum thus due from individuals to the Government a\r\nconsiderable portion is undoubtedly desperate, and in many instances has\r\nprobably been rendered so by remissness in the agents charged with its\r\ncollection. By proper exertions a great part, however, may yet be\r\nrecovered; and whatever may be the portions respectively belonging to\r\nthese two classes, it behooves the Government to ascertain the real\r\nstate of the fact. This can be done only by the prompt adoption of\r\njudicious measures for the collection of such as may be made available.\r\nIt is believed that a very large amount has been lost through the\r\ninadequacy of the means provided for the collection of debts due to the\r\npublic, and that this inadequacy lies chiefly in the want of legal skill\r\nhabitually and constantly employed in the direction of the agents\r\nengaged in the service. It must, I think, be admitted that the\r\nsupervisory power over suits brought by the public, which is now vested\r\nin an _accounting_ officer of the Treasury, not selected with a view to\r\nhis legal knowledge, and encumbered as he is with numerous other duties,\r\noperates unfavorably to the public interest.\r\n\r\nIt is important that this branch of the public service should be\r\nsubjected to the supervision of such professional skill as will give it\r\nefficiency. The expense attendant upon such a modification of the\r\nexecutive department would be justified by the soundest principles of\r\neconomy. I would recommend, therefore, that the duties now assigned to\r\nthe agent of the Treasury, so far as they relate to the superintendence\r\nand management of legal proceedings on the part of the United States, be\r\ntransferred to the Attorney-General, and that this officer be placed on\r\nthe same footing in all respects as the heads of the other Departments,\r\nreceiving like compensation and having such subordinate officers\r\nprovided for his Department as may be requisite for the discharge of\r\nthese additional duties.\r\n\r\nThe professional skill of the Attorney-General, employed in directing\r\nthe conduct of marshals and district attorneys, would hasten the\r\ncollection of debts now in suit and hereafter save much to the\r\nGovernment. It might be further extended to the superintendence of all\r\ncriminal proceedings for offenses against the United States. In making\r\nthis transfer great care should be taken, however, that the power\r\nnecessary to the Treasury Department be not impaired, one of its\r\ngreatest securities consisting in a control over all accounts until they\r\nare audited or reported for suit.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing views I would suggest also an inquiry\r\nwhether the provisions of the act of Congress authorizing the discharge\r\nof the persons of debtors to the Government from imprisonment may not,\r\nconsistently with the public interest, be extended to the release of the\r\ndebt where the conduct of the debtor is wholly exempt from the\r\nimputation of fraud. Some more liberal policy than that which now\r\nprevails in reference to this unfortunate class of citizens is certainly\r\ndue to them, and would prove beneficial to the country. The continuance\r\nof the liability after the means to discharge it have been exhausted can\r\nonly serve to dispirit the debtor; or, where his resources are but\r\npartial, the want of power in the Government to compromise and release\r\nthe demand instigates to fraud as the only resource for securing a\r\nsupport to his family. He thus sinks into a state of apathy, and becomes\r\na useless drone in society or a vicious member of it, if not a feeling\r\nwitness of the rigor and inhumanity of his country. All experience\r\nproves that oppressive debt is the bane of enterprise, and it should be\r\nthe care of a republic not to exert a grinding power over misfortune and\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nSince the last session of Congress numerous frauds on the Treasury have\r\nbeen discovered, which I thought it my duty to bring under the\r\ncognizance of the United States court for this district by a criminal\r\nprosecution. It was my opinion and that of able counsel who were\r\nconsulted that the cases came within the penalties of the act of the\r\nSeventeenth Congress approved 3d March, 1823, providing for the\r\npunishment of frauds committed on the Government of the United States.\r\nEither from some defect in the law or in its administration every\r\neffort, to bring the accused to trial under its provisions proved\r\nineffectual, and the Government was driven to the necessity of resorting\r\nto the vague and inadequate provisions of the common law. It is\r\ntherefore my duty to call your attention to the laws which have been\r\npassed for the protection of the Treasury. If, indeed, there be no\r\nprovision by which those who may be unworthily intrusted with its\r\nguardianship can be punished for the most flagrant violation of duty,\r\nextending even to the most fraudulent appropriation of the public funds\r\nto their own use, it is time to remedy so dangerous an omission; or if\r\nthe law has been perverted from its original purposes, and criminals\r\ndeserving to be punished under its provisions have been rescued by legal\r\nsubtleties, it ought to be made so plain by amendatory provisions as to\r\nbaffle the arts of perversion and accomplish the ends of its original\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nIn one of the most flagrant cases the court decided that the prosecution\r\nwas barred by the statute which limits prosecutions for fraud to two\r\nyears. In this case all the evidences of the fraud, and, indeed, all\r\nknowledge that a fraud had been committed, were in possession of the\r\nparty accused until after the two years had elapsed. Surely the statute\r\nought not to run in favor of any man while he retains all the evidences\r\nof his crime in his own possession, and least of all in favor of a\r\npublic officer who continues to defraud the Treasury and conceal the\r\ntransaction for the brief term of two years. I would therefore recommend\r\nsuch an alteration of the law as will give the injured party and the\r\nGovernment two years after the disclosure of the fraud or after the\r\naccused is out of office to commence their prosecution.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I invite the attention of Congress to a\r\ngeneral and minute inquiry into the condition of the Government, with a\r\nview to ascertain what offices can be dispensed with, what expenses\r\nretrenched, and what improvements may be made in the organization of its\r\nvarious parts to secure the proper responsibility of public agents and\r\npromote efficiency and justice in all its operations.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War will make you acquainted with the\r\ncondition of our Army, fortifications, arsenals, and Indian affairs. The\r\nproper discipline of the Army, the training and equipment of the\r\nmilitia, the education bestowed at West Point, and the accumulation of\r\nthe means of defense applicable to the naval force will tend to prolong\r\nthe peace we now enjoy, and which every good citizen, more especially\r\nthose who have felt the miseries of even a successful warfare, must\r\nardently desire to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nThe returns from the subordinate branches of this service exhibit a\r\nregularity and order highly creditable to its character. Both officers\r\nand soldiers seem imbued with a proper sense of duty, and conform to the\r\nrestraints of exact discipline with that cheerfulness which becomes the\r\nprofession of arms. There is need, however, of further legislation to\r\nobviate the inconveniences specified in the report under consideration,\r\nto some of which it is proper that I should call your particular\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of the 2d March, 1821, to reduce and fix the\r\nmilitary establishment, remaining unexecuted as it regards the command\r\nof one of the regiments of artillery, can not now be deemed a guide to\r\nthe Executive in making the proper appointment. An explanatory act,\r\ndesignating the class of officers out of which this grade is to be\r\nfilled--whether from the military list as existing prior to the act of\r\n1821 or from it as it has been fixed by that act--would remove this\r\ndifficulty. It is also important that the laws regulating the pay and\r\nemoluments of officers generally should be more specific than they now\r\nare. Those, for example, in relation to the Paymaster and Surgeon\r\nGeneral assign to them an annual salary of $2,500, but are silent as to\r\nallowances which in certain exigencies of the service may be deemed\r\nindispensable to the discharge of their duties. This circumstance has\r\nbeen the authority for extending to them various allowances at different\r\ntimes under former Administrations, but no uniform rule has been\r\nobserved on the subject. Similar inconveniences exist in other cases, in\r\nwhich the construction put upon the laws by the public accountants may\r\noperate unequally, produce confusion, and expose officers to the odium\r\nof claiming what is not their due.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your fostering care, as one of our safest means of\r\nnational defense, the Military Academy. This institution has already\r\nexercised the happiest influence upon the moral and intellectual\r\ncharacter of our Army; and such of the graduates as from various causes\r\nmay not pursue the profession of arms will be scarcely less useful as\r\ncitizens. Their knowledge of the military art will be advantageously\r\nemployed in the militia service, and in a measure secure to that class\r\nof troops the advantages which in this respect belong to standing\r\narmies.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest a review of the pension law, for the purpose of\r\nextending its benefits to every Revolutionary soldier who aided in\r\nestablishing our liberties, and who is unable to maintain himself in\r\ncomfort. These relics of the War of Independence have strong claims upon\r\ntheir country's gratitude and bounty. The law is defective in not\r\nembracing within its provisions all those who were during the last war\r\ndisabled from supporting themselves by manual labor. Such an amendment\r\nwould add but little to the amount of pensions, and is called for by the\r\nsympathies of the people as well as by considerations of sound policy.\r\nIt will be perceived that a large addition to the list of pensioners has\r\nbeen occasioned by an order of the late Administration, departing\r\nmaterially from the rules which had previously prevailed. Considering it\r\nan act of legislation, I suspended its operation as soon as I was\r\ninformed that it had commenced. Before this period, however,\r\napplications under the new regulation had been preferred to the number\r\nof 154, of which, on the 27th March, the date of its revocation, 87 were\r\nadmitted. For the amount there was neither estimate nor appropriation;\r\nand besides this deficiency, the regular allowances, according to the\r\nrules which have heretofore governed the Department, exceed the estimate\r\nof its late Secretary by about $50,000, for which an appropriation is\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nYour particular attention is requested to that part of the report of the\r\nSecretary of War which relates to the money held in trust for the Seneca\r\ntribe of Indians. It will be perceived that without legislative aid the\r\nExecutive can not obviate the embarrassments occasioned by the\r\ndiminution of the dividends on that fund, which originally amounted to\r\n$100,000, and has recently been invested in United States 3 per cent\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe condition and ulterior destiny of the Indian tribes within the\r\nlimits of some of our States have become objects of much interest and\r\nimportance. It has long been the policy of Government to introduce among\r\nthem the arts of civilization, in the hope of gradually reclaiming them\r\nfrom a wandering life. This policy has, however, been coupled with\r\nanother wholly incompatible with its success. Professing a desire to\r\ncivilize and settle them, we have at the same time lost no opportunity\r\nto purchase their lands and thrust them farther into the wilderness. By\r\nthis means they have not only been kept in a wandering state, but been\r\nled to look upon us as unjust and indifferent to their fate. Thus,\r\nthough lavish in its expenditures upon the subject, Government has\r\nconstantly defeated its own policy, and the Indians in general, receding\r\nfarther and farther to the west, have retained their savage habits. A\r\nportion, however, of the Southern tribes, having mingled much with the\r\nwhites and made some progress in the arts of civilized life, have lately\r\nattempted to erect an independent government within the limits of\r\nGeorgia and Alabama. These States, claiming to be the only sovereigns\r\nwithin their territories, extended their laws over the Indians, which\r\ninduced the latter to call upon the United States for protection.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the question presented was whether the General\r\nGovernment had a right to sustain those people in their pretensions. The\r\nConstitution declares that \"no new State shall be formed or erected\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of any other State\" without the consent of its\r\nlegislature. If the General Government is not permitted to tolerate the\r\nerection of a confederate State within the territory of one of the\r\nmembers of this Union against her consent, much less could it allow a\r\nforeign and independent government to establish itself there. Georgia\r\nbecame a member of the Confederacy which eventuated in our Federal Union\r\nas a sovereign State, always asserting her claim to certain limits,\r\nwhich, having been originally defined in her colonial charter and\r\nsubsequently recognized in the treaty of peace, she has ever since\r\ncontinued to enjoy, except as they have been circumscribed by her own\r\nvoluntary transfer of a portion of her territory to the United States in\r\nthe articles of cession of 1802. Alabama was admitted into the Union on\r\nthe same footing with the original States, with boundaries which were\r\nprescribed by Congress. There is no constitutional, conventional, or\r\nlegal provision which allows them less power over the Indians within\r\ntheir borders than is possessed by Maine or New York. Would the people\r\nof Maine permit the Penobscot tribe to erect an independent government\r\nwithin their State? And unless they did would it not be the duty of the\r\nGeneral Government to support them in resisting such a measure? Would\r\nthe people of New York permit each remnant of the Six Nations within her\r\nborders to declare itself an independent people under the protection of\r\nthe United States? Could the Indians establish a separate republic on\r\neach of their reservations in Ohio? And if they were so disposed would\r\nit be the duty of this Government to protect them in the attempt? If the\r\nprinciple involved in the obvious answer to these questions be\r\nabandoned, it will follow that the objects of this Government are\r\nreversed, and that it has become a part of its duty to aid in destroying\r\nthe States which it was established to protect.\r\n\r\nActuated by this view of the subject, I informed the Indians inhabiting\r\nparts of Georgia and Alabama that their attempt to establish an\r\nindependent government would not be countenanced by the Executive of the\r\nUnited States, and advised them to emigrate beyond the Mississippi or\r\nsubmit to the laws of those States.\r\n\r\nOur conduct toward these people is deeply interesting to our national\r\ncharacter. Their present condition, contrasted with what they once were,\r\nmakes a most powerful appeal to our sympathies. Our ancestors found them\r\nthe uncontrolled possessors of these vast regions. By persuasion and\r\nforce they have been made to retire from river to river and from\r\nmountain to mountain, until some of the tribes have become extinct and\r\nothers have left but remnants to preserve for awhile their once terrible\r\nnames. Surrounded by the whites with their arts of civilization, which\r\nby destroying the resources of the savage doom him to weakness and\r\ndecay, the fate of the Mohegan, the Narragansett, and the Delaware is\r\nfast overtaking the Choctaw, the Cherokee, and the Creek. That this fate\r\nsurely awaits them if they remain within the limits of the States does\r\nnot admit of a doubt. Humanity and national honor demand that every\r\neffort should be made to avert so great a calamity. It is too late to\r\ninquire whether it was just in the United States to include them and\r\ntheir territory within the bounds of new States, whose limits they could\r\ncontrol. That step can not be retraced. A State can not be dismembered\r\nby Congress or restricted in the exercise of her constitutional power.\r\nBut the people of those States and of every State, actuated by feelings\r\nof justice and a regard for our national honor, submit to you the\r\ninteresting question whether something can not be done, consistently\r\nwith the rights of the States, to preserve this much-injured race.\r\n\r\nAs a means of effecting this end I suggest for your consideration the\r\npropriety of setting apart an ample district west of the Mississippi,\r\nand without the limits of any State or Territory now formed, to be\r\nguaranteed to the Indian tribes as long as they shall occupy it, each\r\ntribe having a distinct control over the portion designated for its use.\r\nThere they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own\r\nchoice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as\r\nmay be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the\r\nseveral tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts\r\nof civilization, and, by promoting union and harmony among them, to\r\nraise up an interesting commonwealth, destined to perpetuate the race\r\nand to attest the humanity and justice of this Government.\r\n\r\nThis emigration should be voluntary, for it would be as cruel as unjust\r\nto compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek\r\na home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if\r\nthey remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to\r\ntheir laws. In return for their obedience as individuals they will\r\nwithout doubt be protected in the enjoyment of those possessions which\r\nthey have improved by their industry. But it seems to me visionary to\r\nsuppose that in this state of things claims can be allowed on tracts of\r\ncountry on which they have neither dwelt nor made improvements, merely\r\nbecause they have seen them from the mountain or passed them in the\r\nchase. Submitting to the laws of the States, and receiving, like other\r\ncitizens, protection in their persons and property, they will ere long\r\nbecome merged in the mass of our population.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of the Navy will make you\r\nacquainted with the condition and useful employment of that branch of\r\nour service during the present year. Constituting as it does the best\r\nstanding security of this country against foreign aggression, it claims\r\nthe especial attention of Government. In this spirit the measures which\r\nsince the termination of the last war have been in operation for its\r\ngradual enlargement were adopted, and it should continue to be cherished\r\nas the offspring of our national experience. It will be seen, however,\r\nthat notwithstanding the great solicitude which has been manifested for\r\nthe perfect organization of this arm and the liberality of the\r\nappropriations which that solicitude has suggested, this object has in\r\nmany important respects not been secured.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace we have need of no more ships of war than are requisite\r\nto the protection of our commerce. Those not wanted for this object must\r\nlay in the harbors, where without proper covering they rapidly decay,\r\nand even under the best precautions for their preservation must soon\r\nbecome useless. Such is already the case with many of our finest\r\nvessels, which, though unfinished, will now require immense sums of\r\nmoney to be restored to the condition in which they were when committed\r\nto their proper element. On this subject there can be but little doubt\r\nthat our best policy would be to discontinue the building of ships of\r\nthe first and second class, and look rather to the possession of ample\r\nmaterials, prepared for the emergencies of war, than to the number of\r\nvessels which we can float in a season of peace, as the index of our\r\nnaval power. Judicious deposits in navy-yards of timber and other\r\nmaterials, fashioned under the hands of skillful workmen and fitted for\r\nprompt application to their various purposes, would enable us at all\r\ntimes to construct vessels as fast as they can be manned, and save the\r\nheavy expense of repairs, except to such vessels as must be employed in\r\nguarding our commerce. The proper points for the establishment of these\r\nyards are indicated with so much force in the report of the Navy Board\r\nthat in recommending it to your attention I deem it unnecessary to do\r\nmore than express my hearty concurrence in their views. The yard in this\r\nDistrict, being already furnished with most of the machinery necessary\r\nfor shipbuilding, will be competent to the supply of the two selected by\r\nthe Board as the best for the concentration of materials, and, from the\r\nfacility and certainty of communication between them, it will be useless\r\nto incur at those depots the expense of similar machinery, especially\r\nthat used in preparing the usual metallic and wooden furniture of\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be effected by dispensing altogether with the\r\nNavy Board as now constituted, and substituting in its stead bureaus\r\nsimilar to those already existing in the War Department. Each member of\r\nthe Board, transferred to the head of a separate bureau charged with\r\nspecific duties, would feel in its highest degree that wholesome\r\nresponsibility which can not be divided without a far more than\r\nproportionate diminution of its force. Their valuable services would\r\nbecome still more so when separately appropriated to distinct portions\r\nof the great interests of the Navy, to the prosperity of which each\r\nwould be impelled to devote himself by the strongest motives. Under such\r\nan arrangement every branch of this important service would assume a\r\nmore simple and precise character, its efficiency would be increased,\r\nand scrupulous economy in the expenditure of public money promoted.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend that the Marine Corps be merged in the artillery\r\nor infantry, as the best mode of curing the many defects in its\r\norganization. But little exceeding in number any of the regiments of\r\ninfantry, that corps has, besides its lieutenant-colonel commandant,\r\nfive brevet lieutenant-colonels, who receive the full pay and emoluments\r\nof their brevet rank, without rendering proportionate service. Details\r\nfor marine service could as well be made from the artillery or infantry,\r\nthere being no peculiar training requisite for it.\r\n\r\nWith these improvements, and such others as zealous watchfulness and\r\nmature consideration may suggest, there can be little doubt that under\r\nan energetic administration of its affairs the Navy may soon be made\r\neverything that the nation wishes it to be. Its efficiency in the\r\nsuppression of piracy in the West India seas, and wherever its squadrons\r\nhave been employed in securing the interests of the country, will appear\r\nfrom the report of the Secretary, to which I refer you for other\r\ninteresting details. Among these I would bespeak the attention of\r\nCongress for the views presented in relation to the inequality between\r\nthe Army and Navy as to the pay of officers. No such inequality should\r\nprevail between these brave defenders of their country, and where it\r\ndoes exist it is submitted to Congress whether it ought not to be\r\nrectified.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster General is referred to as exhibiting a\r\nhighly satisfactory administration of that Department. Abuses have been\r\nreformed, increased expedition in the transportation of the mail\r\nsecured, and its revenue much improved. In a political point of view\r\nthis Department is chiefly important as affording the means of diffusing\r\nknowledge. It is to the body politic what the veins and arteries are to\r\nthe natural--conveying rapidly and regularly to the remotest parts of\r\nthe system correct information of the operations of the Government, and\r\nbringing back to it the wishes and feelings of the people. Through its\r\nagency we have secured to ourselves the full enjoyment of the blessings\r\nof a free press.\r\n\r\nIn this general survey of our affairs a subject of high importance\r\npresents itself in the present organization of the judiciary. An uniform\r\noperation of the Federal Government in the different States is certainly\r\ndesirable, and existing as they do in the Union on the basis of perfect\r\nequality, each State has a right to expect that the benefits conferred\r\non the citizens of others should be extended to hers. The judicial\r\nsystem of the United States exists in all its efficiency in only fifteen\r\nmembers of the Union; to three others the circuit courts, which\r\nconstitute an important part of that system, have been imperfectly\r\nextended, and to the remaining six altogether denied. The effect has\r\nbeen to withhold from the inhabitants of the latter the advantages\r\nafforded (by the Supreme Court) to their fellow-citizens in other States\r\nin the whole extent of the criminal and much of the civil authority of\r\nthe Federal judiciary. That this state of things ought to be remedied,\r\nif it can be done consistently with the public welfare, is not to be\r\ndoubted. Neither is it to be disguised that the organization of our\r\njudicial system is at once a difficult and delicate task. To extend the\r\ncircuit courts equally throughout the different parts of the Union, and\r\nat the same time to avoid such a multiplication of members as would\r\nencumber the supreme appellate tribunal, is the object desired. Perhaps\r\nit might be accomplished by dividing the circuit judges into two\r\nclasses, and providing that the Supreme Court should be held by these\r\nclasses alternately, the Chief Justice always presiding.\r\n\r\nIf an extension of the circuit-court system to those States which do not\r\nnow enjoy its benefits should be determined upon, it would of course be\r\nnecessary to revise the present arrangement of the circuits; and even if\r\nthat system should not be enlarged, such a revision is recommended.\r\n\r\nA provision for taking the census of the people of the United States\r\nwill, to insure the completion of that work within a convenient time,\r\nclaim the early attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe great and constant increase of business in the Department of State\r\nforced itself at an early period upon the attention of the Executive.\r\nThirteen years ago it was, in Mr. Madison's last message to Congress,\r\nmade the subject of an earnest recommendation, which has been repeated\r\nby both of his successors; and my comparatively limited experience has\r\nsatisfied me of its justness. It has arisen from many causes, not the\r\nleast of which is the large addition that has been made to the family of\r\nindependent nations and the proportionate extension of our foreign\r\nrelations. The remedy proposed was the establishment of a home\r\ndepartment--a measure which does not appear to have met the views of\r\nCongress on account of its supposed tendency to increase, gradually and\r\nimperceptibly, the already too strong bias of the federal system toward\r\nthe exercise of authority not delegated to it. I am not, therefore,\r\ndisposed to revive the recommendation, but am not the less impressed\r\nwith the importance of so organizing that Department that its Secretary\r\nmay devote more of his time to our foreign relations. Clearly satisfied\r\nthat the public good would be promoted by some suitable provision on the\r\nsubject, I respectfully invite your attention to it.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the Bank of the United States expires in 1836, and its\r\nstockholders will most probably apply for a renewal of their privileges.\r\nIn order to avoid the evils resulting from precipitancy in a measure\r\ninvolving such important principles and such deep pecuniary interests, I\r\nfeel that I can not, in justice to the parties interested, too soon\r\npresent it to the deliberate consideration of the Legislature and the\r\npeople. Both the constitutionality and the expediency of the law\r\ncreating this bank are well questioned by a large portion of our\r\nfellow-citizens, and it must be admitted by all that it has failed in\r\nthe great end of establishing a uniform and sound currency.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, if such an institution is deemed essential to\r\nthe fiscal operations of the Government, I submit to the wisdom of the\r\nLegislature whether a national one, founded upon the credit of the\r\nGovernment and its revenues, might not be devised which would avoid all\r\nconstitutional difficulties and at the same time secure all the\r\nadvantages to the Government and country that were expected to result\r\nfrom the present bank.\r\n\r\nI can not close this communication without bringing to your view the\r\njust claim of the representatives of Commodore Decatur, his officers and\r\ncrew, arising from the recapture of the frigate _Philadelphia_ under the\r\nheavy batteries of Tripoli. Although sensible, as a general rule, of the\r\nimpropriety of Executive interference under a Government like ours,\r\nwhere every individual enjoys the right of directly petitioning\r\nCongress, yet, viewing this case as one of very peculiar character, I\r\ndeem it my duty to recommend it to your favorable consideration. Besides\r\nthe justice of this claim, as corresponding to those which have been\r\nsince recognized and satisfied, it is the fruit of a deed of patriotic\r\nand chivalrous daring which infused life and confidence into our infant\r\nNavy and contributed as much as any exploit in its history to elevate\r\nour national character. Public gratitude, therefore, stamps her seal\r\nupon it, and the meed should not be withheld which may hereafter operate\r\nas a stimulus to our gallant tars.\r\n\r\nI now commend you, fellow-citizens, to the guidance of Almighty God,\r\nwith a full reliance on His merciful providence for the maintenance of\r\nour free institutions, and with an earnest supplication that whatever\r\nerrors it may be my lot to commit in discharging the arduous duties\r\nwhich have devolved on me will find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom\r\nof your counsels.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\nDecember 8, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 14, 1829_.\r\n_The Vice-President of the United States and President of\r\nthe Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the resolution of the Senate of the 2d March, 1829,\r\nrequesting the President of the United States to communicate to it\r\n\"copies of the journal of the commissioners under the first article of\r\nthe treaty of Ghent for the months of October and November, 1817, or so\r\nmuch thereof as in his opinion may be safely communicated, not including\r\nthe agreement or evidence offered by the agents,\" I have the honor\r\nherewith to transmit a report from the Secretary of State, accompanying\r\nthe document referred to in said resolution.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 14, 1829_.\r\n_The Vice-President of the United States and President of\r\nthe Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their advice and consent as to the\r\nratification of it, a treaty of commerce and navigation between the\r\nUnited States of America and His Majesty the Emperor of Austria,\r\nconcluded and signed in this city on the 2d of August in the present\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 15, 1829_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nA deputation from the Passamaquoddy Indians resident within the limits\r\nof Maine have arrived in this city and presented a memorial soliciting\r\nthe aid of the Government in providing them the means of support.\r\nRecollecting that this tribe when strong and numerous fought with us for\r\nthe liberty which we now enjoy, I could not refuse to present to the\r\nconsideration of Congress their supplication for a small portion of the\r\nbark and timber of the country which once belonged to them.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that from individuals who own the lands adjoining the\r\npresent small possession of this tribe purchases can be made\r\nsufficiently extensive to secure the objects of the memorial in this\r\nrespect, as will appear from the papers herewith transmitted. Should\r\nCongress deem it proper to make them, it will be necessary to provide\r\nfor their being held in trust for the use of the tribe during its\r\nexistence as such.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 16, 1829_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to transmit herewith to the House of Representatives a\r\nreport of the Secretary of War, accompanying copies of surveys[3] made\r\nin pursuance of the acts of Congress passed the 30th of April, 1824, and\r\nthe 2d of March, 1829, and to request that the House cause them to be\r\nlaid before the Senate, as there are no duplicates prepared.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Of Deep Creek, Virginia; Pasquotank River, North Carolina;\r\nentrance of the river Teche, Louisiana; passes at mouth of the\r\nMississippi, Louisiana; water tract between Lake Pontchartrain and\r\nMobile Bay; Des Moines and Rock River rapids in the Mississippi; with a\r\nview to the location of a railroad from Charleston to Hamburg, S.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 22, 1829_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit two treaties--one concluded with the Winnebago tribe\r\nof Indians at Prairie du Chien on the 1st of August, 1829, and the other\r\nwith the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pottawattamie tribes at the same place on\r\nthe 29th of July, 1829--which, with the documents explanatory thereof,\r\nare submitted to the Senate for consideration whether they will advise\r\nand consent to their ratification.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 29, 1829_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a treaty concluded with the Delaware tribe of\r\nIndians on the 3d of August, 1829, which, with the documents explanatory\r\nthereof, is submitted to the consideration of the Senate for their\r\nadvice and consent as to the ratification of the same.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 30, 1829_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the House the report and estimate of the survey\r\nmade in pursuance of the act of the 30th April, 1824, in order to\r\nascertain the practicability of connecting the waters of the Altamaha\r\nand Tennessee rivers by a canal and railroad, and request, as there is\r\nno duplicate of the same prepared, that the House will cause it to be\r\nlaid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 4, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have been requested by the legislature of South Carolina, as will\r\nappear from the documents accompanying this communication, to submit to\r\nthe consideration of Congress certain claims against the United States\r\nfor advances made by that State during the last war. It is conceded that\r\nthe redress sought for can only be obtained through the interposition of\r\nCongress. The only agency allowed to me is to present such facts in\r\nrelation to the subject as are in the possession of the Executive, in\r\norder that the whole may be fairly considered.\r\n\r\nThis duty I perform with great pleasure, being well satisfied that no\r\ninducement will be wanting to secure to the claims of a member of the\r\nConfederacy that has under all circumstances shewn an ardent devotion to\r\nthe cause of the country the most ample justice.\r\n\r\nBy a reference to the Department of War for information as to the nature\r\nand extent of these claims it appears that they consist of--\r\n\r\nFirst. Interest upon moneys advanced for the United States which have\r\nbeen heretofore reimbursed.\r\n\r\nSecond. Certain advances which on a settlement of accounts between South\r\nCarolina and the United States were disallowed or suspended by the\r\naccounting officers of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the former, the rule hitherto adopted by Congress has been\r\nto allow to the States interest only where they had paid it on money\r\nborrowed, and had applied it to the use of the United States. The case\r\nof South Carolina does not come strictly within this rule, because\r\ninstead of borrowing, as she alleges, for the use of the United States,\r\nupon interest, she applied to the use of the United States funds for\r\nwhich she was actually receiving an interest; and she is understood to\r\ninsist that the loss of interest in both cases being equal, and the\r\nrelief afforded equally meritorious, the same principle of remuneration\r\nshould be applied.\r\n\r\nActing upon an enlightened sense of national justice and gratitude, it\r\nis confidently believed that Congress will be as mindful of this claim\r\nas it has been of others put forward by the States that in periods of\r\nextreme peril generously contributed to the service of the Union and\r\nenabled the General Government to discharge its obligations. The grounds\r\nupon which certain portions of it have been suspended or rejected will\r\nappear from the communications of the Secretary of War and Third Auditor\r\nherewith submitted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 4, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a supplement to the treaty made with the Delaware\r\ntribe on the 3d of October, 1818, which, with the accompanying papers,\r\nis submitted to the Senate for their advice and consent as to the\r\nratification of the same.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 5, 1830_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe subject of the inclosed memorial[4] having been adjudicated by the\r\ncourts of the country, and decided against the memorialists, it is\r\nrespectfully laid before Congress, the only power now to which they can\r\nappeal for relief.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Of certain purchasers of land in Louisiana from the\r\nGovernment of Spain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 5, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a report[5] from the Secretary of the Treasury, giving\r\nthe information called for by a resolution of the Senate of the 24th\r\nDecember, 1828.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Transmitting statements of moneys appropriated and lands\r\ngranted to the several States for purposes of education and construction\r\nof roads and canals, etc., since the adoption of the Constitution.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 14, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of three Indian treaties, which have been\r\nduly ratified:\r\n\r\n1. A treaty with the nation of Winnebago Indians, concluded on the 1st\r\nof August, 1829, at Prairie du Chien, in the Territory of Michigan,\r\nbetween General John McNeil, Colonel Pierre Menard, and Caleb At-water,\r\nesq., commissioners on the part of the United States, and certain chiefs\r\nand warriors on the part of the nation of Winnebago Indians.\r\n\r\n2. A treaty with the united nations of Chippewa, Ottowa, and\r\nPottawatomie Indians, concluded on the 29th of July, 1829, at Prairie du\r\nChien, between General John McNeil, Colonel Pierre Menard, and Caleb\r\nAtwater, esq., commissioners on the part of the United States, and\r\ncertain chiefs and warriors of the said united nations on the part of\r\nsaid nations.\r\n\r\n3. Articles of agreement between the United States of America and the\r\nband of Delaware Indians upon the Sandusky River, in the State of Ohio,\r\nentered into on the 3d of August, 1829, at Little Sandusky, in the State\r\nof Ohio, by John McElvain, commissioner on the part of the United\r\nStates, and certain chiefs on the part of said band of Delaware Indians.\r\n\r\nI transmit also the estimates of appropriation necessary to carry them\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 19, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The accompanying gold medal, commemorative of the delivery of\r\nthe Liberator President of the Republic of Colombia from the daggers of\r\nassassins on the night of the 25th of September last, has been offered\r\nfor my acceptance by that Government. The respect which I entertain as\r\nwell for the character of the Liberator President as for the people and\r\nGovernment over which he presides renders this mark of their regard most\r\ngratifying to my feelings; but I am prevented from complying with their\r\nwishes by the provision of our Constitution forbidding the acceptance of\r\npresents from a foreign state by officers of the United States, and it\r\nis therefore placed at the disposal of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe powerful influence in the affairs of his country which the\r\nsacrifices and heroic deeds of General Bolivar have acquired for him\r\ncreates an anxiety as to his future course in which the friends of\r\nliberal institutions throughout the world deeply participate. The\r\nfavorable estimate which I have formed of the nature of the services\r\nrendered by him, and of his personal character, impresses me with the\r\nstrongest confidence that his conduct in the present condition of his\r\ncountry will be such as may best promote her true interest and best\r\nsecure his own permanent fame.\r\n\r\nI deem the present a suitable occasion to inform you that shortly after\r\nmy communication to Congress at the opening of the session dispatches\r\nwere received from Mr. Moore, the envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States to Colombia, stating that he had\r\nsucceeded in obtaining the assent of the council of ministers to the\r\nallowance of the claims of our citizens upon that Government in the\r\ncases of the brig _Josephine_ and her cargo and the schooner _Ranger_\r\nand part of her cargo. An official copy of the convention subsequently\r\nentered into between Mr. Moore and the secretary of foreign affairs,\r\nproviding for the final settlement of those claims, has just been\r\nreceived at the Department of State. By an additional article of this\r\nconvention the claim in the case of the brig _Morris_ is suspended until\r\nfurther information is obtained by the Colombian Government from the\r\nCourt at Carracas; and Mr. Moore anticipates its early and satisfactory\r\nadjustment. The convention only waited the ratification of the Liberator\r\nPresident, who was at the time absent from Bogota, to be binding upon\r\nthe Colombian Government. Although these claims are not, comparatively,\r\nof a large amount, yet the prompt and equitable manner in which the\r\napplication of Mr. Moore in behalf of our injured citizens was met by\r\nthat Government entitles its conduct to our approbation, and promises\r\nwell for the future relations of the two countries.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to add an expression of my entire satisfaction with\r\nthe conduct of Mr. Moore since his arrival at Bogota. The judgment and\r\ndiscretion evinced by him on occasions of much interest and delicacy,\r\nthe assiduity displayed in bringing so nearly to a conclusion within\r\nfive weeks after his arrival claims which had been pending for years,\r\nand the promptitude and capacity with which he has entered upon other\r\nand more important portions of his official duty are calculated to\r\ninspire strong confidence in his future usefulness.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 20, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives._\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I respectfully submit to your consideration the accompanying\r\ncommunication from the Secretary or the Treasury, showing that according\r\nto the terms of an agreement between the United States and the United\r\nSociety of Christian Indians the latter have a claim to an annuity of\r\n$400, commencing from the 1st of October, 1826, for which an\r\nappropriation by law for this amount, as long as they are entitled to\r\nreceive it, will be proper.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 26, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress a communication from the Secretary of State,\r\ntogether with the report of the Superintendent of the Patent Office, to\r\nwhich it refers, showing the present condition of that office and\r\nsuggesting the necessity of further legislative provisions in regard to\r\nit, and I recommend the subjects it embraces to the particular attention\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that there is an unexplained deficiency in the accounts\r\nwhich have been rendered at the Treasury of the fees received at the\r\noffice, amounting to $4,290, and that precautions have been provided to\r\nguard against similar delinquencies in future. Congress will decide on\r\ntheir sufficiency and whether any legislative aid is necessary upon this\r\nbranch of the subject referred to in the report.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 26, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI find it necessary to recommend to Congress a revision of the laws\r\nrelating to the direct and contingent expenses of our intercourse with\r\nforeign nations, and particularly of the act of May 1, 1810, entitled\r\n\"An act fixing the compensation of public ministers and of consuls\r\nresiding on the coast of Barbary, and for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from the Fifth Auditor of the Treasury to the Secretary of\r\nState, herewith transmitted, which notices the difficulties incident to\r\nthe settlement of the accounts of certain diplomatic agents of the\r\nUnited States, serves to show the necessity of this revision. This\r\nbranch of the Government is incessantly called upon to sanction\r\nallowances which not unfrequently appear to have just and equitable\r\nfoundations in usage, but which are believed to be incompatible with the\r\nprovisions of the act of 1810. The letter from the Fifth Auditor\r\ncontains a description of several claims of this character which are\r\nsubmitted to Congress as the only tribunal competent to afford the\r\nrelief to which the parties consider themselves entitled.\r\n\r\nAmong the most prominent questions of this description are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_I. Claims for outfits by ministers and charges d'affaires duly\r\nappointed by the President and Senate_.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1790, regulating the expenditures for foreign intercourse,\r\nprovided \"that, exclusive of an outfit, which shall in no case exceed\r\none year's full salary to the minister plenipotentiary or chargé\r\nd'affaires to whom the same may be allowed, the President shall not\r\nallow to any minister plenipotentiary a greater sum than at the rate of\r\n$9,000 per annum as a compensation for all his personal services and\r\nother expenses, nor a greater sum for the same than $4,500 per annum to\r\na chargé d'affaires.\" By this provision the maximum of allowance only\r\nwas fixed, leaving the question as to any outfit, either in whole or in\r\npart, to the discretion of the President, to be decided according to\r\ncircumstances. Under it a variety of cases occurred, in which outfits\r\nhaving been given to diplomatic agents on their first appointment,\r\nafterwards, upon their being transferred to other courts or sent upon\r\nspecial and distinct missions, full or half outfits were again allowed.\r\n\r\nThis act, it will be perceived, although it fixes the maximum of outfit,\r\nis altogether silent as to the circumstances under which outfits might\r\nbe allowed; indeed, the authority to allow them at all is not expressly\r\nconveyed, but only incidentally adverted to in limiting the amount. This\r\nlimitation continued to be the only restriction upon the Executive until\r\n1810, the act of 1790 having been kept in force till that period by five\r\nsuccessive reenactments, in which it is either referred to by means of\r\nits title or its terms are repeated verbatim. In 1810 an act passed\r\nwherein the phraseology which had been in use for twenty years is\r\ndeparted from. Fixing the same limits precisely to the _amount_ of\r\nsalaries and outfits to ministers and chargés as had been six times\r\nfixed since 1790, it differs from preceding acts by formally conveying\r\nan authority to allow an outfit to \"a minister plenipotentiary or chargé\r\nd'affaires _on going from the United States to any foreign country_;\"\r\nand, in addition to this specification of the circumstances under which\r\nthe outfit may be allowed, it contains one of the conditions which shall\r\nbe requisite to entitle a chargé or secretary to the compensation\r\ntherein provided.\r\n\r\nUpon a view of all the circumstances connected with the subject I can\r\nnot permit myself to doubt that it was with reference to the practice of\r\nmultiplying outfits to the same person and in the intention of\r\nprohibiting it in future that this act was passed.\r\n\r\nIt being, however, frequently deemed advantageous to transfer ministers\r\nalready abroad from one court to another, or to employ those who were\r\nresident at a particular court upon special occasions elsewhere, it\r\nseems to have been considered that it was not the intention of Congress\r\nto restrain the Executive from so doing. It was further contended that\r\nthe President being left free to select for ministers citizens, whether\r\nat home or abroad, a right on the part of such ministers to the usual\r\nemoluments followed as a matter of course. This view was sustained by\r\nthe opinion of the law officer of the Government, and the act of 1810\r\nwas construed to leave the whole subject of salary and outfit where it\r\nfound it under the law of 1790; that is to say, completely at the\r\ndiscretion of the President, without any other restriction than the\r\nmaximum already fixed by that law. This discretion has from time to time\r\nbeen exercised by successive Presidents; but whilst I can not but\r\nconsider the restriction in this respect imposed by the act of 1810 as\r\ninexpedient, I can not feel myself justified in adopting a construction\r\nwhich defeats the only operation of which this part of it seems\r\nsusceptible; at least, not unless Congress, after having the subject\r\ndistinctly brought to their consideration, should virtually give their\r\nassent to that construction. Whatever may be thought of the propriety of\r\ngiving an outfit to secretaries of legation or others who may be\r\nconsidered as only temporarily charged with, the affairs intrusted to\r\nthem, I am impressed with the justice of such an allowance in the case\r\nof a citizen who happens to be abroad when first appointed, and that of\r\na minister already in place, when the public interest requires his\r\ntransfer, and, from the breaking up of his establishment and other\r\ncircumstances connected with the change, he incurs expenses to which he\r\nwould not otherwise have been subjected.\r\n\r\n_II. Claims for outfits and salaries by chargés d'affaires and\r\nsecretaries of legation who have not been appointed by the President by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nBy the second section of the act of 1810 it is provided--\r\n\r\n    That to entitle any chargé d'affaires or secretary of any legation\r\n    or embassy to any foreign country, or secretary of any minister\r\n    plenipotentiary, to the compensation hereinbefore provided they\r\n    shall respectively be appointed by the President of the United\r\n    States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; but in the\r\n    recess of the Senate the President is hereby authorized to make such\r\n    appointments, which shall be submitted to the Senate at the next\r\n    session thereafter for their advice and consent; and no compensation\r\n    shall be allowed to any chargé d'affaires or any of the secretaries\r\n    hereinbefore described who shall not be appointed as aforesaid.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the explicit language of this act, claims for outfits\r\nand salaries have been made--and allowed at the Treasury--by chargés\r\nd'affaires and secretaries of legation who had not been appointed in the\r\nmanner specified. Among the accompanying documents will be found several\r\nclaims of this description, of which a detailed statement is given in\r\nthe letter of the Fifth Auditor. The case of Mr. William B. Lawrence,\r\nlate chargé d'affaires at London, is of a still more peculiar character,\r\nin consequence of his having actually drawn his outfit and salary from\r\nthe bankers employed by the Government, and from the length of time he\r\nofficiated in that capacity. Mr. Lawrence's accounts were rendered to\r\nthe late Administration, but not settled. I have refused to sanction the\r\nallowance claimed, because the law does not authorize it, but have\r\nrefrained from directing any proceedings to compel a reimbursement of\r\nthe money thus, in my judgment, illegally received until an opportunity\r\nshould be afforded to Congress to pass upon the equity of the claim.\r\n\r\nAppropriations are annually and necessarily made \"for the contingent\r\nexpenses of all the missions abroad\" and \"for the contingent expenses of\r\nforeign intercourse,\" and the expenditure of these funds intrusted to\r\nthe discretion of the President. It is out of those appropriations that\r\nallowances of this character have been claimed, and, it is presumed,\r\nmade. Deeming, however, that the discretion thus committed to the\r\nExecutive does not extend to the allowance of charges prohibited by\r\nexpress law, I have felt it my duty to refer all existing claims to the\r\naction of Congress, and to submit to their consideration whether any\r\nalteration of the law in this respect is necessary.\r\n\r\n_III. The allowance of a quarter's salary to ministers and chargés\r\nd'affaires to defray their expenses home_.\r\n\r\nThis allowance has been uniformly made, but is without authority by law.\r\nResting in Executive discretion, it has, according to circumstances,\r\nbeen extended to cases where the ministers died abroad, to defray the\r\nreturn of his family, and was recently claimed in a case where the\r\nminister had no family, on grounds of general equity. A charge of this\r\ndescription can hardly be regarded as a contingent one, and if allowed\r\nat all must be in lieu of salary. As such it is altogether arbitrary,\r\nalthough it is not believed that the interests of the Treasury are, upon\r\nthe whole, much affected by the substitution. In some cases the\r\nallowance is for a longer period than is occupied in the return of the\r\nminister; in others, for one somewhat less; and it seems to do away all\r\ninducement to unnecessary delay. The subject is, however, susceptible of\r\npositive regulation by law, and it is, on many accounts, highly\r\nexpedient that it should be placed on that footing. I have therefore,\r\nwithout directing any alteration in the existing practice, felt it my\r\nduty to bring it to your notice.\r\n\r\n_IV. Traveling and other expenses in following the court in cases where\r\nits residence is not stationary_.\r\n\r\nThe only legations by which expenses of this description are incurred\r\nand charged are those to Spain and the Netherlands, and to them they\r\nhave on several occasions been allowed. Among the documents herewith\r\ncommunicated will be found, with other charges requiring legislative\r\ninterference, an account for traveling expenses, with a statement of the\r\ngrounds upon which their reimbursement is claimed. This account has been\r\nsuspended by the officer of the Treasury to whom its settlement belongs;\r\nand as the question will be one of frequent recurrence, I have deemed\r\nthe occasion a fit one to submit the whole subject to the revision of\r\nCongress. The justice of these charges for extraordinary expenses\r\nunavoidably incurred has been admitted by former Administrations and the\r\nclaims allowed. My difficulty grows out of the language of the act of\r\n1810, which expressly declares that the salary and outfit it authorizes\r\nto the minister and chargé d'affaires shall be \"a compensation for all\r\nhis personal services and expenses.\" The items which ordinarily form the\r\ncontingent expenses of a foreign mission are of a character distinct\r\nfrom the _personal_ expenses of the minister. The difficulty of\r\nregarding those now referred to in that light is obvious. There are\r\ncertainly strong considerations of equity in favor of a remuneration for\r\nthem at the two Courts where they are alone incurred, and if such should\r\nbe the opinion of Congress it is desirable that authority to make it\r\nshould be expressly conferred by law rather than continue to rest upon\r\ndoubtful construction.\r\n\r\n_V. Charges of consuls for discharging diplomatic functions, without\r\nappointment, during a temporary vacancy in the office of chargé\r\nd'affaires._\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes happened that consuls of the United States, upon the\r\noccurrence of vacancies at their places of residence in the diplomatic\r\noffices of the United States by the death or retirement of our minister\r\nor chargé d'affaires, have taken under their care the papers of such\r\nmissions and usefully discharged diplomatic functions in behalf of their\r\nGovernment and fellow-citizens till the vacancies were regularly filled.\r\nIn some instances this is stated to have been done to the abandonment of\r\nother pursuits and at a considerably increased expense of living. There\r\nare existing claims of this description, which can not be finally\r\nadjusted or allowed without the sanction of Congress. A particular\r\nstatement of them accompanies this communication.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this branch of the public service makes it necessary to\r\ncommit portions of the expenses incurred in it to Executive discretion;\r\nbut it is desirable that such portions should be as small as possible.\r\nThe purity and permanent success of our political institutions depend in\r\na great measure upon definite appropriations and a rigid adherence to\r\nthe enactments of the Legislature disposing of public money. My desire\r\nis to have the subject placed upon a more simple and precise, but not\r\nless liberal, footing than it stands on at present, so far as that may\r\nbe found practicable. An opinion that the salaries allowed by law to our\r\nagents abroad are in many cases inadequate is very general, and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that this impression has not been without its\r\ninfluence in the construction of the laws by which those salaries are\r\nfixed. There are certainly motives which it is difficult to resist to an\r\nincreased expense on the part of some of our functionaries abroad\r\ngreatly beyond that which would be required at home.\r\n\r\nShould Congress be of opinion that any alteration for the better can be\r\nmade, either in the rate of salaries now allowed or in the rank and\r\ngradation of our diplomatic agents, or both, the present would be a fit\r\noccasion for a revision of the whole subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I transmit herewith the annual report of the inspectors of\r\nthe penitentiary in the District of Columbia, and beg leave to recommend\r\nthe propriety of providing by law a reasonable compensation for the\r\nservice of those officers. The act of Congress under which they were\r\ncommissioned, though it imposes upon them important duties, in the\r\nperformance of which much time and labor are necessary, is silent as to\r\nthe compensation which they ought to receive.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_February 1, 1830_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 5, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith communicate to the Senate a letter from the Secretary of War,\r\nwith the papers which accompany it, in answer to the resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 2d February, requesting \"so much of a report received from\r\nthe officer of the United States Army who had command of the detachment\r\nfor the protection of the caravan of traders to Santa Fe of New Mexico\r\nduring the last summer as may be proper to be made public and material\r\nto be known, devising further means for the security of the inland trade\r\nbetween Missouri and Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 12, 1830_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI forward to the House of Representatives, for the information and\r\ndecision of Congress, a communication to me from the Secretary of War on\r\nthe subject of the continuation of the Cumberland road.\r\n\r\nThere being but one plan of the surveys made produces the necessity of\r\nmaking this communication to but one branch of the Legislature. When the\r\nquestion shall be disposed of, I request that the map may be returned to\r\nthe Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 18, 1830_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th\r\ninstant, requesting information respecting the accounts of William B.\r\nLawrence as chargé d'affaires of the United States to Great Britain, I\r\nhave the honor to communicate a report of the Secretary of State,\r\nfurnishing the desired information.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 20, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Having seen a report from the Treasury Department, just made\r\nto me, that General John Campbell, lately nominated Indian agent, stands\r\nrecorded as a public defaulter on the books of the Treasury, and being\r\nunapprised of this fact when he was nominated to the Senate, I beg leave\r\nto withdraw this nomination.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: In compliance with your resolution of the 4th ultimo,\r\nrelating to the boundary line between the United States and the Cherokee\r\nNation of Indians, I have duly examined the same, and find that the\r\nExecutive has no power to alter or correct it.\r\n\r\nI therefore return the papers, with a report from the Secretary of War\r\non the subject, for the further deliberation of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1830_.\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of Congress a letter of the governor of\r\nVirginia, transmitting two acts of the general assembly of that State,\r\nrespecting the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1830_.\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to your consideration the memorials of Francis H.

Dickson, lately nominated to be receiver of\r\npublic moneys at Mount Salus, Miss., is a defaulter, I beg leave to\r\nwithdraw his nomination, and to nominate in his place Hiram G. Rennels.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 6, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The accompanying propositions, in the form of a treaty, have\r\nbeen recently sent to me by special messenger from the Choctaw Nation of\r\nIndians, and since it was received a protest against it has been\r\nforwarded. Both evince a desire to cede to the United States all their\r\ncountry east of the Mississippi, and both are here submitted. These\r\nmeasures are the voluntary acts of the Indians themselves. The\r\nGovernment was not represented in the councils which adopted them, nor\r\nhad it any previous intimation that such steps were in contemplation.\r\nThe Indians convened of their own accord, settled and executed the\r\npropositions contained in the treaty presented to me, and agreed to be\r\nbound by them if within three months they should receive the approbation\r\nof the President and Senate. The other measure is equally their own.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly desirous, on various and very pressing accounts, as will\r\nappear from the accompanying documents, that some agreement should be\r\nconcluded with the Indians by which an object so important as their\r\nremoval beyond the territorial limits of the States may be effected. In\r\nsettling the terms of such an agreement I am disposed to exercise the\r\nutmost liberality, and to concur in any which are consistent with the\r\nConstitution and not incompatible with the interests of the United\r\nStates and their duties to the Indians. I can not, however, regard the\r\nterms proposed by the Choctaws to be in all respects of this character;\r\nbut desirous of concluding an arrangement upon such as are, I have drawn\r\nup the accompanying amendments, which I propose to offer to the Choctaws\r\nif they meet the approbation of the Senate. The conditions which they\r\noffer are such as, in my judgment, will be most likely to be acceptable\r\nto both parties and are liable to the fewest objections. Not being\r\ntenacious, though, on the subject, I will most cheerfully adopt any\r\nmodifications which on a frank interchange of opinions my constitutional\r\nadvisers may suggest and which I shall be satisfied are reconcilable\r\nwith my official duties.\r\n\r\nWith these views, I ask the opinion of the Senate upon the following\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\nWill the Senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with the Choctaw\r\nNation according to the terms which they propose? Or will the Senate\r\nadvise the conclusion of a treaty with that tribe as modified by the\r\nalterations suggested by me? If not, what further alteration or\r\nmodification will the Senate propose?\r\n\r\nI am fully aware that in thus resorting to the early practice of the\r\nGovernment, by asking the previous advice of the Senate in the discharge\r\nof this portion of my duties, I am departing from a long and for many\r\nyears an unbroken usage in similar cases. But being satisfied that this\r\nresort is consistent with the provisions of the Constitution, that it is\r\nstrongly recommended in this instance by considerations of expediency,\r\nand that the reasons which have led to the observance of a different\r\npractice, though very cogent in negotiations with foreign nations, do\r\nnot apply with equal force to those made with Indian tribes, I flatter\r\nmyself that it will not meet the disapprobation of the Senate. Among the\r\nreasons for a previous expression of the views of the Senate the\r\nfollowing are stated as most prominent:\r\n\r\n1. The Indians have requested that their propositions should be\r\nsubmitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\n2. The opinion of the Senate in relation to the terms to be proposed\r\nwill have a salutary effect in a future negotiation, if one should be\r\ndeemed proper.\r\n\r\n3. The Choctaw is one of the most numerous and powerful tribes within\r\nour borders, and as the conclusion of a treaty with them may have a\r\ncontrolling effect upon other tribes it is important that its terms\r\nshould be well considered. Those now proposed by the Choctaws, though\r\nobjectionable, it is believed are susceptible of modifications which\r\nwill leave them conformable to the humane and liberal policy which the\r\nGovernment desires to observe toward the Indian tribes, and be at the\r\nsame time acceptable to them. To be possessed of the views of the Senate\r\non this important and delicate branch of our future negotiations would\r\nenable the President to act much more effectively in the exercise of his\r\nparticular functions. There is also the best reason to believe that\r\nmeasures in this respect emanating from the united counsel of the\r\ntreaty-making power would be more satisfactory to the American people\r\nand to the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the pecuniary stipulations are large; and in\r\nbringing this subject to the consideration of the Senate I may be\r\nallowed to remark that the amount of money which may be secured to be\r\npaid should, in my judgment, be viewed as of minor importance. If a fund\r\nadequate to the object in view can be obtained from the lands which they\r\ncede, all the purposes of the Government should be regarded as answered.\r\nThe great desideratum is the removal of the Indians and the settlement\r\nof the perplexing question involved in their present location--a\r\nquestion in which several of the States of this Union have the deepest\r\ninterest, and which, if left undecided much longer, may eventuate in\r\nserious injury to the Indians.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 13, 1830_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The inclosed documents will present to Congress the necessity\r\nof some legislative provision by which to prevent the offenses to which\r\nthey refer. At present it appears there is no law existing for the\r\npunishment of persons guilty of interrupting the public surveyors when\r\nengaged in the performance of the trusts confided to them. I suggest,\r\ntherefore, for your consideration the propriety of adopting some\r\nprovision, with adequate penalties, to meet the case.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 13, 1830_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I have the honor, in compliance with a resolution of your\r\nHouse of the 10th ultimo, to transmit the inclosed documents, which\r\nfurnish all the information of the steps that have been taken and plans\r\nprocured for the erection of a radiating marine railway for the repair\r\nof sloops of war at the navy-yard at Pensacola.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 14, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I herewith transmit to Congress the report of the engineer\r\nemployed to survey the bar at the mouth of Sag Harbor, to ascertain the\r\nbest method of preventing the harbor being filled up with sand, and the\r\ncost of the same, authorized by the act of the 2d of March, 1829.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 21, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: It having been represented to me that some of the members of\r\nthe Senate voted against the confirmation of the appointment of Major\r\nM.M. Noah as surveyor of the port of New York through misapprehension,\r\nand having received the accompanying letter and memorial from a number\r\nof the most respectable merchants and citizens of that city, setting\r\nforth his fitness for the office, I therefore renominate him to the\r\nSenate as surveyor of the customs for the port of New York.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 25, 1830_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I transmit herewith, for the use of the House, the report of\r\na survey[9] made in compliance with the act of the 2d of March, 1829.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Of the harbors of Stamford and Norwalk, Conn.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 26, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I think it my duty to inform you that I am daily expecting\r\nthe definitive answer of the British Government to a proposition which\r\nhas been submitted to it by this, upon the subject of the colonial\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThis communication has been delayed by a confident belief that the\r\nanswer referred to would have been received early enough to have\r\nadmitted of its submission to you in sufficient season for the final\r\naction of Congress at its present session, and is now induced by an\r\napprehension that although the packet by which it was intended to be\r\nsent is hourly expected, its arrival may, nevertheless, be delayed until\r\nafter your adjournment.\r\n\r\nShould this branch of the negotiation committed to our minister be\r\nsuccessful, the present interdict would, nevertheless, be necessarily\r\ncontinued until the next session of Congress, as the President has in no\r\nevent authority to remove it.\r\n\r\nAlthough no decision had been made at the date of our last advices from\r\nMr. McLane, yet from the general character of the interviews between him\r\nand those of His Majesty's ministers whose particular duty it was to\r\nconfer with him on the subject there is sufficient reason to expect a\r\nfavorable result to justify me in submitting to you the propriety of\r\nproviding for a decision in the recess.\r\n\r\nThis may be done by authorizing the President, in case an arrangement\r\ncan be effected upon such terms as Congress would approve, to carry the\r\nsame into effect on our part by proclamation, or, if it should be\r\nthought advisable, to execute the views of Congress by like means in the\r\nevent of an unfavorable decision.\r\n\r\nAny information in the possession of the Executive which you may deem\r\nnecessary to guide your deliberations, and which it may, under existing\r\ncircumstances, be proper to communicate, shall be promptly laid before\r\nyou, if required.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 27, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to me to be able to communicate to the Senate before\r\nthe termination of its present session, for its advice and consent as to\r\nthe ratification of it, a convention just received at the Department of\r\nState between the United States and His Majesty the King of Denmark,\r\nwhich was negotiated on the part of the former by Mr. Henry Wheaton,\r\ntheir chargé d'affaires at the Court of Denmark, and on that of the\r\nlatter by the Sieurs Henry Count de Schemmelman, his minister of foreign\r\naffairs, and Paul Christian de Stemann, president of his chancery, and\r\nconcluded and signed by these plenipotentiaries at Copenhagen on the\r\n28th of March of the present year.\r\n\r\nThe convention provides by compromise for the adjustment and payment of\r\nindemnities to no inconsiderable amount, long sought from the Government\r\nof Denmark by that of the United States, in behalf of their citizens who\r\nhad preferred claims for the same, relating to the seizure, detention,\r\nand condemnation or confiscation of their vessels, cargoes, or property\r\nby the public armed ships or by the tribunals of Denmark or in the\r\nstates subject to the Danish scepter; and there is every reason to\r\nbelieve, as the Senate will infer from the correspondence which\r\naccompanies this communication, that the proposed arrangement will prove\r\nentirely satisfactory to them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 28, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: For the reasons expressed in the inclosed note, I renominate\r\nWharton Rector to be agent for the Shawnee and Delaware Indians.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The rejection of Colonel Rector by the Senate took place in the\r\nabsence of Mr. McLean and myself. We were both confined to our rooms by\r\nillness. Had we been present his nomination would have been confirmed. I\r\nbelieve that if he were again placed before the Senate his nomination\r\nwould be confirmed, and should therefore be pleased if he could be again\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\nJ. ROWAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 29, 1830_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Having approved and signed a resolution, originating in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, which provides \"that the pay, subsistence,\r\nemoluments, and allowances received by the officers of the Marine Corps\r\nprevious to the 1st of April, 1829, be, and the same is hereby, directed\r\nto be continued to them from that date up to the 28th of February,\r\n1831,\" it becomes my duty to call the attention of Congress to the fact\r\nthat the estimates for that branch of the public service submitted to\r\nthem at the commencement of the present session were made with reference\r\nto the pay, subsistence, emoluments, and allowances provided for by law,\r\nand excluding those which previously to the 1st of April, 1829, had been\r\nmade on the authority of the Department alone, and to suggest the\r\npropriety of an appropriation to meet the increased expenditure.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 29, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a report[10] from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ngiving the information called for by a resolution of the Senate of the\r\n3d of March, 1829.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Transmitting statements of lands appropriated by Congress\r\nfor specific objects within the several States, etc.; disbursements made\r\nwithin the several States and Territories from the commencement of the\r\nGovernment to December 31, 1828; value of exports from the commencement\r\nof the Government to September 30, 1828. ]\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 30, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: I have approved and signed the bill entitled \"An act making\r\nappropriations for examinations and surveys, and also for certain works\r\nof internal improvement,\" but as the phraseology of the section which\r\nappropriates the sum of $8,000 for the road from Detroit to Chicago may\r\nbe construed to authorize the application of the appropriation for the\r\ncontinuance of the road beyond the limits of the Territory of Michigan,\r\nI desire to be understood as having approved this bill with the\r\nunderstanding that the road authorized by this section is not to be\r\nextended beyond the limits of the said Territory.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 27, 1830_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: I have maturely considered the bill proposing to authorize \"a\r\nsubscription of stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington\r\nTurnpike Road Company,\" and now return the same to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in which it originated, with my objections to its\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nSincerely friendly to the improvement of our country by means of roads\r\nand canals, I regret that any difference of opinion in the mode of\r\ncontributing to it should exist between us; and if in stating this\r\ndifference I go beyond what the occasion may be deemed to call for, I\r\nhope to find an apology in the great importance of the subject, an\r\nunfeigned respect for the high source from which this branch of it has\r\nemanated, and an anxious wish to be correctly understood by my\r\nconstituents in the discharge of all my duties. Diversity of sentiment\r\namong public functionaries actuated by the same general motives, on the\r\ncharacter and tendency of particular measures, is an incident common to\r\nall Governments, and the more to be expected in one which, like ours,\r\nowes its existence to the freedom of opinion, and must be upheld by the\r\nsame influence. Controlled as we thus are by a higher tribunal, before\r\nwhich our respective acts will be canvassed with the indulgence due to\r\nthe imperfections of our nature, and with that intelligence and unbiased\r\njudgment which are the true correctives of error, all that our\r\nresponsibility demands is that the public good should be the measure of\r\nour views, dictating alike their frank expression and honest\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nIn the message which was presented to Congress at the opening of its\r\npresent session I endeavored to exhibit briefly my views upon the\r\nimportant and highly interesting subject to which our attention is now\r\nto be directed. I was desirous of presenting to the representatives of\r\nthe several States in Congress assembled the inquiry whether some mode\r\ncould not be devised which would reconcile the diversity of opinion\r\nconcerning the powers of this Government over the subject of internal\r\nimprovement, and the manner in which these powers, if conferred by the\r\nConstitution, ought to be exercised. The act which I am called upon to\r\nconsider has, therefore, been passed with a knowledge of my views on\r\nthis question, as these are expressed in the message referred to. In\r\nthat document the following suggestions will be found:\r\n\r\n    After the extinction of the public debt it is not probable that any\r\n    adjustment of the tariff upon principles satisfactory to the people\r\n    of the Union will until a remote period, if ever, leave the\r\n    Government without a considerable surplus in the Treasury beyond\r\n    what may be required for its current service. As, then, the period\r\n    approaches when the application of the revenue to the payment of\r\n    debt will cease, the disposition of the surplus will present a\r\n    subject for the serious deliberation of Congress; and it may be\r\n    fortunate for the country that it is yet to be decided. Considered\r\n    in connection with the difficulties which have heretofore attended\r\n    appropriations for purposes of internal improvement, and with those\r\n    which this experience tells us will certainly arise whenever power\r\n    over such subjects may be exercised by the General Government, it is\r\n    hoped that it may lead to the adoption of some plan which will\r\n    reconcile the diversified interests of the States and strengthen the\r\n    bonds which unite them. Every member of the Union, in peace and in\r\n    war, will be benefited by the improvement of inland navigation and\r\n    the construction of highways in the several States. Let us, then,\r\n    endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory\r\n    to all. That hitherto adopted has by many of our fellow-citizens\r\n    been deprecated as an infraction of the Constitution, while by\r\n    others it has been viewed as inexpedient. All feel that it has been\r\n    employed at the expense of harmony in the legislative councils.\r\n\r\nAnd adverting to the constitutional power of Congress to make what I\r\nconsidered a proper disposition of the surplus revenue, I subjoined the\r\nfollowing remarks:\r\n\r\n    To avoid these evils it appears to me that the most safe, just, and\r\n    federal disposition which could be made of the surplus revenue would\r\n    be its apportionment among the several States according to their\r\n    ratio of representation, and should this measure not be found\r\n    warranted by the Constitution that it would be expedient to propose\r\n    to the States an amendment authorizing it.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional power of the Federal Government to construct or\r\npromote works of internal improvement presents itself in two points of\r\nview--the first as bearing upon the sovereignty of the States within\r\nwhose limits their execution is contemplated, if jurisdiction of the\r\nterritory which they may occupy be claimed as necessary to their\r\npreservation and use; the second as asserting the simple right to\r\nappropriate money from the National Treasury in aid of such works when\r\nundertaken by State authority, surrendering the claim of jurisdiction.\r\nIn the first view the question of power is an open one, and can be\r\ndecided without the embarrassments attending the other, arising from the\r\npractice of the Government. Although frequently and strenuously\r\nattempted, the power to this extent has never been exercised by the\r\nGovernment in a single instance. It does not, in my opinion, possess it;\r\nand no bill, therefore, which admits it can receive my official\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\nBut in the other view of the power the question is differently situated.\r\nThe ground taken at an early period of the Government was \"that whenever\r\nmoney has been raised by the general authority and is to be applied to a\r\nparticular measure, a question arises whether the particular measure be\r\nwithin the enumerated authorities vested in Congress. If it be, the\r\nmoney requisite for it may be applied to it; if not, no such application\r\ncan be made.\" The document in which this principle was first advanced is\r\nof deservedly high authority, and should be held in grateful remembrance\r\nfor its immediate agency in rescuing the country from much existing\r\nabuse and for its conservative effect upon some of the most valuable\r\nprinciples of the Constitution. The symmetry and purity of the\r\nGovernment would doubtless have been better preserved if this\r\nrestriction of the power of appropriation could have been maintained\r\nwithout weakening its ability to fulfill the general objects of its\r\ninstitution, an effect so likely to attend its admission,\r\nnotwithstanding its apparent fitness, that every subsequent\r\nAdministration of the Government, embracing a period of thirty out of\r\nthe forty-two years of its existence, has adopted a more enlarged\r\nconstruction of the power. It is not my purpose to detain you by a\r\nminute recital of the acts which sustain this assertion, but it is\r\nproper that I should notice some of the most prominent in order that the\r\nreflections which they suggest to my mind may be better understood.\r\n\r\nIn the Administration of Mr. Jefferson we have two examples of the\r\nexercise of the right of appropriation, which in the considerations that\r\nled to their adoption and in their effects upon the public mind have had\r\na greater agency in marking the character of the power than any\r\nsubsequent events. I allude to the payment of $15,000,000 for the\r\npurchase of Louisiana and to the original appropriation for the\r\nconstruction of the Cumberland road, the latter act deriving much weight\r\nfrom the acquiescence and approbation of three of the most powerful of\r\nthe original members of the Confederacy, expressed through their\r\nrespective legislatures. Although the circumstances of the latter case\r\nmay be such as to deprive so much of it as relates to the actual\r\nconstruction of the road of the force of an obligatory exposition of the\r\nConstitution, it must, nevertheless, be admitted that so far as the mere\r\nappropriation of money is concerned they present the principle in its\r\nmost imposing aspect. No less than twenty-three different laws have been\r\npassed, through all the forms of the Constitution, appropriating upward\r\nof $2,500,000 out of the National Treasury in support of that\r\nimprovement, with the approbation of every President of the United\r\nStates, including my predecessor, since its commencement.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the sanction given to appropriations for the Cumberland\r\nand other roads and objects under this power, the Administration of Mr.\r\nMadison was characterized by an act which furnishes the strongest\r\nevidence of his opinion of its extent. A bill was passed through both\r\nHouses of Congress and presented for his approval, \"setting apart and\r\npledging certain funds for constructing roads and canals and improving\r\nthe navigation of water courses, in order to facilitate, promote, and\r\ngive security to internal commerce among the several States and to\r\nrender more easy and less expensive the means and provisions for the\r\ncommon defense.\" Regarding the bill as asserting a power in the Federal\r\nGovernment to construct roads and canals within the limits of the States\r\nin which they were made, he objected to its passage on the ground of its\r\nunconstitutionality, declaring that the assent of the respective States\r\nin the mode provided by the bill could not confer the power in question;\r\nthat the only cases in which the consent and cession of particular\r\nStates can extend the power of Congress are those specified and provided\r\nfor in the Constitution, and superadding to these avowals his opinion\r\nthat \"a restriction of the power 'to provide for the common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare' to cases which are to be provided for by the\r\nexpenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of\r\nCongress all the great and most important measures of Government, money\r\nbeing the ordinary and necessary means of carrying them into execution.\"\r\nI have not been able to consider these declarations in any other point\r\nof view than as a concession that the right of appropriation is not\r\nlimited by the power to carry into effect the measure for which the\r\nmoney is asked, as was formerly contended.\r\n\r\nThe views of Mr. Monroe upon this subject were not left to inference.\r\nDuring his Administration a bill was passed through both Houses of\r\nCongress conferring the jurisdiction and prescribing the mode by which\r\nthe Federal Government should exercise it in the case of the Cumberland\r\nroad. He returned it with objections to its passage, and in assigning\r\nthem took occasion to say that in the early stages of the Government he\r\nhad inclined to the construction that it had no right to expend money\r\nexcept in the performance of acts authorized by the other specific\r\ngrants of power, according to a strict construction of them, but that on\r\nfurther reflection and observation his mind had undergone a change; that\r\nhis opinion then was \"that Congress have an unlimited power to raise\r\nmoney, and that in its appropriation they have a discretionary power,\r\nrestricted only by the duty to appropriate it to purposes of common\r\ndefense, and of general, not local, national, not State, benefit;\" and\r\nthis was avowed to be the governing principle through the residue of his\r\nAdministration. The views of the last Administration are of such recent\r\ndate as to render a particular reference to them unnecessary. It is well\r\nknown that the appropriating power, to the utmost extent which had been\r\nclaimed for it, in relation to internal improvements was fully\r\nrecognized and exercised by it.\r\n\r\nThis brief reference to known facts will be sufficient to show the\r\ndifficulty, if not impracticability, of bringing back the operations of\r\nthe Government to the construction of the Constitution set up in 1798,\r\nassuming that to be its true reading in relation to the power under\r\nconsideration, thus giving an admonitory proof of the force of\r\nimplication and the necessity of guarding the Constitution with\r\nsleepless vigilance against the authority of precedents which have not\r\nthe sanction of its most plainly defined powers; for although it is the\r\nduty of all to look to that sacred instrument instead of the statute\r\nbook, to repudiate at all times encroachments upon its spirit, which are\r\ntoo apt to be effected by the conjuncture of peculiar and facilitating\r\ncircumstances, it is not less true that the public good and the nature\r\nof our political institutions require that individual differences should\r\nyield to a well-settled acquiescence of the people and confederated\r\nauthorities in particular constructions of the Constitution on doubtful\r\npoints. Not to concede this much to the spirit of our institutions would\r\nimpair their stability and defeat the objects of the Constitution\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe bill before me does not call for a more definite opinion upon the\r\nparticular circumstances which will warrant appropriations of money by\r\nCongress to aid works of internal improvement, for although the\r\nextension of the power to apply money beyond that of carrying into\r\neffect the object for which it is appropriated has, as we have seen,\r\nbeen long claimed and exercised by the Federal Government, yet such\r\ngrants have always been professedly under the control of the general\r\nprinciple that the works which might be thus aided should be \"of a\r\ngeneral, not local, national, not State,\" character. A disregard of this\r\ndistinction would of necessity lead to the subversion of the federal\r\nsystem. That even this is an unsafe one, arbitrary in its nature, and\r\nliable, consequently, to great abuses, is too obvious to require the\r\nconfirmation of experience. It is, however, sufficiently definite and\r\nimperative to my mind to forbid my approbation of any bill having the\r\ncharacter of the one under consideration. I have given to its provisions\r\nall the reflection demanded by a just regard for the interests of those\r\nof our fellow-citizens who have desired its passage, and by the respect\r\nwhich is due to a coordinate branch of the Government, but I am not able\r\nto view it in any other light than as a measure of purely local\r\ncharacter; or, if it can be considered national, that no further\r\ndistinction between the appropriate duties of the General and State\r\nGovernments need be attempted, for there can be no local interest that\r\nmay not with equal propriety be denominated national. It has no\r\nconnection with any established system of improvements; is exclusively\r\nwithin the limits of a State, starting at a point on the Ohio River and\r\nrunning out 60 miles to an interior town, and even as far as the State\r\nis interested conferring partial instead of general advantages.\r\n\r\nConsidering the magnitude and importance of the power, and the\r\nembarrassments to which, from the very nature of the thing, its exercise\r\nmust necessarily be subjected, the real friends of internal improvement\r\nought not to be willing to confide it to accident and chance. What is\r\nproperly _national_ in its character or otherwise is an inquiry which is\r\noften extremely difficult of solution. The appropriations of one year\r\nfor an object which is considered national may be rendered nugatory by\r\nthe refusal of a succeeding Congress to continue the work on the ground\r\nthat it is local. No aid can be derived from the intervention of\r\ncorporations. The question regards the character of the work, not that\r\nof those by whom it is to be accomplished. Notwithstanding the union of\r\nthe Government with the corporation by whose immediate agency any work\r\nof internal improvement is carried on, the inquiry will still remain. Is\r\nit national and conducive to the benefit of the whole, or local and\r\noperating only to the advantage of a portion of the Union?\r\n\r\nBut although I might not feel it to be my official duty to interpose the\r\nExecutive veto to the passage of a bill appropriating money for the\r\nconstruction of such works as are authorized by the States and are\r\nnational in their character, I do not wish to be understood as\r\nexpressing an opinion that it is expedient at this time for the General\r\nGovernment to embark in a system of this kind; and anxious that my\r\nconstituents should be possessed of my views on this as well as on all\r\nother subjects which they have committed to my discretion, I shall state\r\nthem frankly and briefly. Besides many minor considerations, there are\r\ntwo prominent views of the subject which have made a deep impression\r\nupon my mind, which, I think, are well entitled to your serious\r\nattention, and will, I hope, be maturely weighed by the people.\r\n\r\nFrom the official communication submitted to you it appears that if no\r\nadverse and unforeseen contingency happens in our foreign relations and\r\nno unusual diversion be made of the funds set apart for the payment of\r\nthe national debt we may look with confidence to its entire\r\nextinguishment in the short period of four years. The extent to which\r\nthis pleasing anticipation is dependent upon the policy which may be\r\npursued in relation to measures of the character of the one now under\r\nconsideration must be obvious to all, and equally so that the events of\r\nthe present session are well calculated to awaken public solicitude upon\r\nthe subject. By the statement from the Treasury Department and those\r\nfrom the clerks of the Senate and House of Representatives, herewith\r\nsubmitted, it appears that the bills which have passed into laws, and\r\nthose which in all probability will pass before the adjournment of\r\nCongress, anticipate appropriations which, with the ordinary\r\nexpenditures for the support of Government, will exceed considerably the\r\namount in the Treasury for the year 1830. Thus, whilst we are\r\ndiminishing the revenue by a reduction of the duties on tea, coffee, and\r\ncocoa the appropriations for internal improvement are increasing beyond\r\nthe available means of the Treasury. And if to this calculation be added\r\nthe amounts contained in bills which are pending before the two Houses,\r\nit may be safely affirmed that $10,000,000 would not make up the excess\r\nover the Treasury receipts, unless the payment of the national debt be\r\npostponed and the means now pledged to that object applied to those\r\nenumerated in these bills. Without a well-regulated system of internal\r\nimprovement this exhausting mode of appropriation is not likely to be\r\navoided, and the plain consequence must be either a continuance of the\r\nnational debt or a resort to additional taxes.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the States, with a laudable zeal and under the\r\ninfluence of an enlightened policy, are successfully applying their\r\nseparate efforts to works of this character, the desire to enlist the\r\naid of the General Government in the construction of such as from their\r\nnature ought to devolve upon it, and to which the means of the\r\nindividual States are inadequate, is both rational and patriotic, and if\r\nthat desire is not gratified now it does not follow that it never will\r\nbe. The general intelligence and public spirit of the American people\r\nfurnish a sure guaranty that at the proper time this policy will be made\r\nto prevail under circumstances more auspicious to its successful\r\nprosecution than those which now exist. But great as this object\r\nundoubtedly is, it is not the only one which demands the fostering care\r\nof the Government. The preservation and success of the republican\r\nprinciple rest with us. To elevate its character and extend its\r\ninfluence rank among our most important duties, and the best means to\r\naccomplish this desirable end are those which will rivet the attachment\r\nof our citizens to the Government of their choice by the comparative\r\nlightness of their public burthens and by the attraction which the\r\nsuperior success of its operations will present to the admiration and\r\nrespect of the world. Through the favor of an overruling and indulgent\r\nProvidence our country is blessed with general prosperity and our\r\ncitizens exempted from the pressure of taxation, which other less\r\nfavored portions of the human family are obliged to bear; yet it is true\r\nthat many of the taxes collected from our citizens through the medium of\r\nimposts have for a considerable period been onerous. In many particulars\r\nthese taxes have borne severely upon the laboring and less prosperous\r\nclasses of the community, being imposed on the necessaries of life, and\r\nthis, too, in cases where the burthen was not relieved by the\r\nconsciousness that it would ultimately contribute to make us independent\r\nof foreign nations for articles of prime necessity by the encouragement\r\nof their growth and manufacture at home. They have been cheerfully borne\r\nbecause they were thought to be necessary to the support of Government\r\nand the payment of the debts unavoidably incurred in the acquisition and\r\nmaintenance of our national rights and liberties. But have we a right to\r\ncalculate on the same cheerful acquiescence when it is known that the\r\nnecessity for their continuance would cease were it not for irregular,\r\nimprovident, and unequal appropriations of the public funds? Will not\r\nthe people demand, as they have a right to do, such a prudent system of\r\nexpenditure as will pay the debts of the Union and authorize the\r\nreduction of every tax to as low a point as the wise observance of the\r\nnecessity to protect that portion of our manufactures and labor whose\r\nprosperity is essential to our national safety and independence will\r\nallow? When the national debt is paid, the duties upon those articles\r\nwhich we do not raise may be repealed with safety, and still leave, I\r\ntrust, without oppression to any section of the country, an accumulating\r\nsurplus fund, which may be beneficially applied to some well-digested\r\nsystem of improvement.\r\n\r\nUnder this view the question as to the manner in which the Federal\r\nGovernment can or ought to embark in the construction of roads and\r\ncanals, and the extent to which it may impose burthens on the people for\r\nthese purposes, may be presented on its own merits, free of all disguise\r\nand of every embarrassment, except such as may arise from the\r\nConstitution itself. Assuming these suggestions to be correct, will not\r\nour constituents require the observance of a course by which they can be\r\neffected? Ought they not to require it? With the best disposition to\r\naid, as far as I can conscientiously, in furtherance of works of\r\ninternal improvement, my opinion is that the soundest views of national\r\npolicy at this time point to such a course. Besides the avoidance of an\r\nevil influence upon the local concerns of the country, how solid is the\r\nadvantage which the Government will reap from it in the elevation of its\r\ncharacter! How gratifying the effect of presenting to the world the\r\nsublime spectacle of a Republic of more than 12,000,000 happy people, in\r\nthe fifty-fourth year of her existence, after having passed through two\r\nprotracted wars--the one for the acquisition and the other for the\r\nmaintenance of liberty--free from debt and with all her immense\r\nresources unfettered! What a salutary influence would not such an\r\nexhibition exercise upon the cause of liberal principles and free\r\ngovernment throughout the world! Would we not ourselves find in its\r\neffect an additional guaranty that our political institutions will be\r\ntransmitted to the most remote posterity without decay? A course of\r\npolicy destined to witness events like these can not be benefited by a\r\nlegislation which tolerates a scramble for appropriations that have no\r\nrelation to any general system of improvement, and whose good effects\r\nmust of necessity be very limited. In the best view of these\r\nappropriations, the abuses to which they lead far exceed the good which\r\nthey are capable of promoting. They may be resorted to as artful\r\nexpedients to shift upon the Government the losses of unsuccessful\r\nprivate speculation, and thus, by ministering to personal ambition and\r\nself-aggrandizement, tend to sap the foundations of public virtue and\r\ntaint the administration of the Government with a demoralizing\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIn the other view of the subject, and the only remaining one which it is\r\nmy intention to present at this time, is involved the expediency of\r\nembarking in a system of internal improvement without a previous\r\namendment of the Constitution explaining and defining the precise powers\r\nof the Federal Government over it. Assuming the right to appropriate\r\nmoney to aid in the construction of national works to be warranted by\r\nthe cotemporaneous and continued exposition of the Constitution, its\r\ninsufficiency for the successful prosecution of them must be admitted by\r\nall candid minds. If we look to usage to define the extent of the right,\r\nthat will be found so variant and embracing so much that has been\r\noverruled as to involve the whole subject in great uncertainty and to\r\nrender the execution of our respective duties in relation to it replete\r\nwith difficulty and embarrassment. It is in regard to such works and the\r\nacquisition of additional territory that the practice obtained its first\r\nfooting. In most, if not all, other disputed questions of appropriation\r\nthe construction of the Constitution may be regarded as unsettled if the\r\nright to apply money in the enumerated cases is placed on the ground of\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nThis subject has been one of much, and, I may add, painful, reflection\r\nto me. It has bearings that are well calculated to exert a powerful\r\ninfluence upon our hitherto prosperous system of government, and which,\r\non some accounts, may even excite despondency in the breast of an\r\nAmerican citizen. I will not detain you with professions of zeal in the\r\ncause of internal improvements. If to be their friend is a virtue which\r\ndeserves commendation, our country is blessed with an abundance of it,\r\nfor I do not suppose there is an intelligent citizen who does not wish\r\nto see them flourish. But though all are their friends, but few, I\r\ntrust, are unmindful of the means by which they should be promoted; none\r\ncertainly are so degenerate as to desire their success at the cost of\r\nthat sacred instrument with the preservation of which is indissolubly\r\nbound our country's hopes. If different impressions are entertained in\r\nany quarter; if it is expected that the people of this country, reckless\r\nof their constitutional obligations, will prefer their local interest to\r\nthe principles of the Union, such expectations will in the end be\r\ndisappointed; or if it be not so, then indeed has the world but little\r\nto hope from the example of free government. When an honest observance\r\nof constitutional compacts can not be obtained from communities like\r\nours, it need not be anticipated elsewhere, and the cause in which there\r\nhas been so much martyrdom, and from which so much was expected by the\r\nfriends of liberty, may be abandoned, and the degrading truth that man\r\nis unfit for self-government admitted. And this will be the case if\r\n_expediency_ be made a rule of construction in interpreting the\r\nConstitution. Power in no government could desire a better shield for\r\nthe insidious advances which it is ever ready to make upon the checks\r\nthat are designed to restrain its action.\r\n\r\nBut I do not entertain such gloomy apprehensions. If it be the wish of\r\nthe people that the construction of roads and canals should be conducted\r\nby the Federal Government, it is not only highly expedient, but\r\nindispensably necessary, that a previous amendment of the Constitution,\r\ndelegating the necessary power and defining and restricting its exercise\r\nwith reference to the sovereignty of the States, should be made. Without\r\nit nothing extensively useful can be effected. The right to exercise as\r\nmuch jurisdiction as is necessary to preserve the works and to raise\r\nfunds by the collection of tolls to keep them in repair can not be\r\ndispensed with. The Cumberland road should be an instructive admonition\r\nof the consequences of acting without this right. Year after year\r\ncontests are witnessed, growing out of efforts to obtain the necessary\r\nappropriations for completing and repairing this useful work. Whilst one\r\nCongress may claim and exercise the power, a succeeding one may deny it;\r\nand this fluctuation of opinion must be unavoidably fatal to any scheme\r\nwhich from its extent would promote the interests and elevate the\r\ncharacter of the country. The experience of the past has shown that the\r\nopinion of Congress is subject to such fluctuations.\r\n\r\nIf it be the desire of the people that the agency of the Federal\r\nGovernment should be confined to the appropriation of money in aid of\r\nsuch undertakings, in virtue of State authorities, then the occasion,\r\nthe manner, and the extent of the appropriations should be made the\r\nsubject of constitutional regulation. This is the more necessary in\r\norder that they may be equitable among the several States, promote\r\nharmony between different sections of the Union and their\r\nrepresentatives, preserve other parts of the Constitution from being\r\nundermined by the exercise of doubtful powers or the too great extension\r\nof those which are not so, and protect the whole subject against the\r\ndeleterious influence of combinations to carry by concert measures\r\nwhich, considered by themselves, might meet but little countenance.\r\n\r\nThat a constitutional adjustment of this power upon equitable principles\r\nis in the highest degree desirable can scarcely be doubted, nor can it\r\nfail to be promoted by every sincere friend to the success of our\r\npolitical institutions. In no government are appeals to the source of\r\npower in cases of real doubt more suitable than in ours. No good motive\r\ncan be assigned for the exercise of power by the constituted\r\nauthorities, while those for whose benefit it is to be exercised have\r\nnot conferred it and may not be willing to confer it. It would seem to\r\nme that an honest application of the conceded powers of the General\r\nGovernment to the advancement of the common weal present a sufficient\r\nscope to satisfy a reasonable ambition. The difficulty and supposed\r\nimpracticability of obtaining an amendment of the Constitution in this\r\nrespect is, I firmly believe, in a great degree unfounded. The time has\r\nnever yet been when the patriotism and intelligence of the American\r\npeople were not fully equal to the greatest exigency, and it never will\r\nwhen the subject calling forth their interposition is plainly presented\r\nto them. To do so with the questions involved in this bill, and to urge\r\nthem to an early, zealous, and full consideration of their deep\r\nimportance, is, in my estimation, among the highest of our duties.\r\n\r\nA supposed connection between appropriations for internal improvement\r\nand the system of protecting duties, growing out of the anxieties of\r\nthose more immediately interested in their success, has given rise to\r\nsuggestions which it is proper I should notice on this occasion. My\r\nopinions on these subjects have never been concealed from those who had\r\na right to know them. Those which I have entertained on the latter have\r\nfrequently placed me in opposition to individuals as well as communities\r\nwhose claims upon my friendship and gratitude are of the strongest\r\ncharacter, but I trust there has been nothing in my public life which\r\nhas exposed me to the suspicion of being thought capable of sacrificing\r\nmy views of duty to private considerations, however strong they may have\r\nbeen or deep the regrets which they are capable of exciting.\r\n\r\nAs long as the encouragement of domestic manufactures is directed to\r\nnational ends it shall receive from me a temperate but steady support.\r\nThere is no necessary connection between it and the system of\r\nappropriations. On the contrary, it appears to me that the supposition\r\nof their dependence upon each other is calculated to excite the\r\nprejudices of the public against both. The former is sustained on the\r\ngrounds of its consistency with the letter and spirit of the\r\nConstitution, of its origin being traced to the assent of all the\r\nparties to the original compact, and of its having the support and\r\napprobation of a majority of the people, on which account it is at least\r\nentitled to a fair experiment. The suggestions to which I have alluded\r\nrefer to a forced continuance of the national debt by means of large\r\nappropriations as a substitute for the security which the system derives\r\nfrom the principles on which it has hitherto been sustained. Such a\r\ncourse would certainly indicate either an unreasonable distrust of the\r\npeople or a consciousness that the system does not possess sufficient\r\nsoundness for its support if left to their voluntary choice and its own\r\nmerits. Those who suppose that any policy thus founded can be long\r\nupheld in this country have looked upon its history with eyes very\r\ndifferent from mine. This policy, like every other, must abide the will\r\nof the people, who will not be likely to allow any device, however\r\nspecious, to conceal its character and tendency.\r\n\r\nIn presenting these opinions I have spoken with the freedom and candor\r\nwhich I thought the occasion for their expression called for, and now\r\nrespectfully return the bill which has been under consideration for your\r\nfurther deliberation and judgment.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 31, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I have considered the bill proposing \"to authorize a\r\nsubscription of stock in the Washington Turnpike Road Company,\" and now\r\nreturn the same to the Senate, in which it originated.\r\n\r\nI am unable to approve this bill, and would respectfully refer the\r\nSenate to my message to the House of Representatives on returning to\r\nthat House the bill \"to authorize a subscription of stock in the\r\nMaysville, Washington, Paris and Lexington Turnpike Road Company\" for a\r\nstatement of my objections to the bill herewith returned.

To give complete\r\neffect to the benevolent designs of said act, and that the Army may be\r\ncorrectly informed, it is hereby proclaimed that a free and full pardon\r\nis extended to those who at the date of this order stand in the\r\ncharacter of deserters. All who are under arrest for this offense at the\r\ndifferent posts and garrisons will be forthwith liberated, and return to\r\ntheir duty. Such as are roaming at large and those who are under\r\nsentence of death are discharged, and are not again to be permitted to\r\nenter the Army, nor at any time hereafter to be enlisted in the service\r\nof the country. It is desirable and highly important that the ranks of\r\nthe Army should be composed of respectable, not degraded, materials.\r\nThose who can be so lost to the obligations of a soldier as to abandon a\r\ncountry which morally they are bound to defend, and which solemnly they\r\nhave sworn to serve, are unworthy, and should be confided in no more.

JONES, _Adjutant-General._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n_December 6, 1830_.\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe pleasure I have in congratulating you upon your return to your\r\nconstitutional duties is much heightened by the satisfaction which the\r\ncondition of our beloved country at this period justly inspires. The\r\nbeneficent Author of All Good has granted to us during the present year\r\nhealth, peace, and plenty, and numerous causes for joy in the wonderful\r\nsuccess which attends the progress of our free institutions.\r\n\r\nWith a population unparalleled in its increase, and possessing a\r\ncharacter which combines the hardihood of enterprise with the\r\nconsiderateness of wisdom, we see in every section of our happy country\r\na steady improvement in the means of social intercourse, and\r\ncorrespondent effects upon the genius and laws of our extended Republic.\r\n\r\nThe apparent exceptions to the harmony of the prospect are to be\r\nreferred rather to inevitable diversities in the various interests which\r\nenter into the composition of so extensive a whole than to any want of\r\nattachment to the Union--interests whose collisions serve only in the\r\nend to foster the spirit of conciliation and patriotism so essential to\r\nthe preservation of that Union which I most devoutly hope is destined to\r\nprove imperishable.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these blessings we have recently witnessed changes in\r\nthe condition of other nations which may in their consequences call for\r\nthe utmost vigilance, wisdom, and unanimity in our councils, and the\r\nexercise of all the moderation and patriotism of our people.\r\n\r\nThe important modifications of their Government, effected with so much\r\ncourage and wisdom by the people of France, afford a happy presage of\r\ntheir future course, and have naturally elicited from the kindred\r\nfeelings of this nation that spontaneous and universal burst of applause\r\nin which you have participated. In congratulating you, my\r\nfellow-citizens, upon an event so auspicious to the dearest interests of\r\nmankind I do no more than respond to the voice of my country, without\r\ntranscending in the slightest degree that salutary maxim of the\r\nillustrious Washington which enjoins an abstinence from all interference\r\nwith the internal affairs of other nations. From a people exercising in\r\nthe most unlimited degree the right of self-government, and enjoying, as\r\nderived from this proud characteristic, under the favor of Heaven, much\r\nof the happiness with which they are blessed; a people who can point in\r\ntriumph to their free institutions and challenge comparison with the\r\nfruits they bear, as well as with the moderation, intelligence, and\r\nenergy with which they are administered--from such a people the deepest\r\nsympathy was to be expected in a struggle for the sacred principles of\r\nliberty, conducted in a spirit every way worthy of the cause, and\r\ncrowned by a heroic moderation which has disarmed revolution of its\r\nterrors. Notwithstanding the strong assurances which the man whom we so\r\nsincerely love and justly admire has given to the world of the high\r\ncharacter of the present King of the French, and which if sustained to\r\nthe end will secure to him the proud appellation of Patriot King, it is\r\nnot in his success, but in that of the great principle which has borne\r\nhim to the throne--the paramount authority of the public will--that the\r\nAmerican people rejoice.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that the anticipations which were indulged at\r\nthe date of my last communication on the subject of our foreign affairs\r\nhave been fully realized in several important particulars.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement has been effected with Great Britain in relation to the\r\ntrade between the United States and her West India and North American\r\ncolonies which has settled a question that has for years afforded matter\r\nfor contention and almost uninterrupted discussion, and has been the\r\nsubject of no less than six negotiations, in a manner which promises\r\nresults highly favorable to the parties.\r\n\r\nThe abstract right of Great Britain to monopolize the trade with her\r\ncolonies or to exclude us from a participation therein has never been\r\ndenied by the United States. But we have contended, and with reason,\r\nthat if at any time Great Britain may desire the productions of this\r\ncountry as necessary to her colonies they must be received upon\r\nprinciples of just reciprocity, and, further, that it is making an\r\ninvidious and unfriendly distinction to open her colonial ports to the\r\nvessels of other nations and close them against those of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAntecedently to 1794 a portion of our productions was admitted into the\r\ncolonial islands of Great Britain by particular concessions, limited to\r\nthe term of one year, but renewed from year to year. In the\r\ntransportation of these productions, however, our vessels were not\r\nallowed to engage, this being a privilege reserved to British shipping,\r\nby which alone our produce could be taken to the islands and theirs\r\nbrought to us in return. From Newfoundland and her continental\r\npossessions all our productions, as well as our vessels, were excluded,\r\nwith occasional relaxations, by which, in seasons of distress, the\r\nformer were admitted in British bottoms.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of 1794 she offered to concede to us for a limited time\r\nthe right of carrying to her West India possessions in our vessels not\r\nexceeding 70 tons burthen, and upon the same terms as British vessels,\r\nany productions of the United States which British vessels might import\r\ntherefrom. But this privilege was coupled with conditions which are\r\nsupposed to have led to its rejection by the Senate; that is, that\r\nAmerican vessels should land their return cargoes in the United States\r\nonly, and, moreover, that they should during the continuance of the\r\nprivilege be precluded from carrying molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa, or\r\ncotton either from those islands or from the United States to any other\r\npart of the world. Great Britain readily consented to expunge this\r\narticle from the treaty, and subsequent attempts to arrange the terms of\r\nthe trade either by treaty stipulations or concerted legislation having\r\nfailed, it has been successively suspended and allowed according to the\r\nvarying legislation of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe following are the prominent points which have in later years\r\nseparated the two Governments: Besides a restriction whereby all\r\nimportations into her colonies in American vessels are confined to our\r\nown products carried hence, a restriction to which it does not appear\r\nthat we have ever objected, a leading object on the part of Great\r\nBritain has been to prevent us from becoming the carriers of British\r\nWest India commodities to any other country than our own. On the part of\r\nthe United States it has been contended, first, that the subject should\r\nbe regulated by treaty stipulation in preference to separate\r\nlegislation; second, that our productions, when imported into the\r\ncolonies in question, should not be subject to higher duties than the\r\nproductions of the mother country or of her other colonial possessions,\r\nand, third, that our vessels should be allowed to participate in the\r\ncircuitous trade between the United States and different parts of the\r\nBritish dominions.\r\n\r\nThe first point, after having been for a long time strenuously insisted\r\nupon by Great Britain, was given up by the act of Parliament of July,\r\n1825, all vessels suffered to trade with the colonies being permitted to\r\nclear from thence with any articles which British vessels might export\r\nand proceed to any part of the world, Great Britain and her dependencies\r\nalone excepted. On our part each of the above points had in succession\r\nbeen explicitly abandoned in negotiations preceding that of which the\r\nresult is now announced.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement secures to the United States every advantage asked by\r\nthem, and which the state of the negotiation allowed us to insist upon.\r\nThe trade will be placed upon a footing decidedly more favorable to this\r\ncountry than any on which it ever stood, and our commerce and navigation\r\nwill enjoy in the colonial ports of Great Britain every privilege\r\nallowed to other nations.\r\n\r\nThat the prosperity of the country so far as it depends on this trade\r\nwill be greatly promoted by the new arrangement there can be no doubt.\r\nIndependently of the more obvious advantages of an open and direct\r\nintercourse, its establishment will be attended with other consequences\r\nof a higher value. That which has been carried on since the mutual\r\ninterdict under all the expense and inconvenience unavoidably incident\r\nto it would have been insupportably onerous had it not been in a great\r\ndegree lightened by concerted evasions in the mode of making the\r\ntrans-shipments at what are called the neutral ports. These indirections\r\nare inconsistent with the dignity of nations that have so many motives\r\nnot only to cherish feelings of mutual friendship, but to maintain such\r\nrelations as will stimulate their respective citizens and subjects to\r\nefforts of direct, open, and honorable competition only, and preserve\r\nthem from the influence of seductive and vitiating circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen your preliminary interposition was asked at the close of the last\r\nsession, a copy of the instructions under which Mr. McLane has acted,\r\ntogether with the communications which had at that time passed between\r\nhim and the British Government, was laid before you. Although there has\r\nnot been anything in the acts of the two Governments which requires\r\nsecrecy, it was thought most proper in the then state of the negotiation\r\nto make that communication a confidential one. So soon, however, as the\r\nevidence of execution on the part of Great Britain is received the whole\r\nmatter shall be laid before you, when it will be seen that the\r\napprehension which appears to have suggested one of the provisions of\r\nthe act passed at your last session, that the restoration of the trade\r\nin question might be connected with other subjects and was sought to be\r\nobtained at the sacrifice of the public interest in other particulars,\r\nwas wholly unfounded, and that the change which has taken place in the\r\nviews of the British Government has been induced by considerations as\r\nhonorable to both parties as I trust the result will prove beneficial.\r\n\r\nThis desirable result was, it will be seen, greatly promoted by the\r\nliberal and confiding provisions of the act of Congress of the last\r\nsession, by which our ports were upon the reception and annunciation by\r\nthe President of the required assurance on the part of Great Britain\r\nforthwith opened to her vessels before the arrangement could be carried\r\ninto effect on her part, pursuing in this act of prospective legislation\r\na similar course to that adopted by Great Britain in abolishing, by her\r\nact of Parliament in 1825, a restriction then existing and permitting\r\nour vessels to clear from the colonies on their return voyages for any\r\nforeign country whatever before British vessels had been relieved from\r\nthe restriction imposed by our law of returning directly from the United\r\nStates to the colonies, a restriction which she required and expected\r\nthat we should abolish. Upon each occasion a limited and temporary\r\nadvantage has been given to the opposite party, but an advantage of no\r\nimportance in comparison with the restoration of mutual confidence and\r\ngood feeling, and the ultimate establishment of the trade upon fair\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIt gives me unfeigned pleasure to assure you that this negotiation has\r\nbeen throughout characterized by the most frank and friendly spirit on\r\nthe part of Great Britain, and concluded in a manner strongly indicative\r\nof a sincere desire to cultivate the best relations with the United\r\nStates. To reciprocate this disposition to the fullest extent of my\r\nability is a duty which I shall deem it a privilege to discharge.\r\n\r\nAlthough the result is itself the best commentary on the services\r\nrendered to his country by our minister at the Court of St. James, it\r\nwould be doing violence to my feelings were I to dismiss the subject\r\nwithout expressing the very high sense I entertain of the talent and\r\nexertion which have been displayed by him on the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe injury to the commerce of the United States resulting from the\r\nexclusion of our vessels from the Black Sea and the previous footing of\r\nmere sufferance upon which even the limited trade enjoyed by us with\r\nTurkey has hitherto been placed have for a long time been a source of\r\nmuch solicitude to this Government, and several endeavors have been made\r\nto obtain a better state of things. Sensible of the importance of the\r\nobject, I felt it my duty to leave no proper means unemployed to acquire\r\nfor our flag the same privileges that are enjoyed by the principal\r\npowers of Europe. Commissioners were consequently appointed to open a\r\nnegotiation with the Sublime Porte. Not long after the member of the\r\ncommission who went directly from the United States had sailed, the\r\naccount of the treaty of Adrianople, by which one of the objects in view\r\nwas supposed to be secured, reached this country. The Black Sea was\r\nunderstood to be opened to us. Under the supposition that this was the\r\ncase, the additional facilities to be derived from the establishment of\r\ncommercial regulations with the Porte were deemed of sufficient\r\nimportance to require a prosecution of the negotiation as originally\r\ncontemplated. It was therefore persevered in, and resulted in a treaty,\r\nwhich will be forthwith laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nBy its provisions a free passage is secured, without limitation of time,\r\nto the vessels of the United States to and from the Black Sea, including\r\nthe navigation thereof, and our trade with Turkey is placed on the\r\nfooting of the most favored nation. The latter is an arrangement wholly\r\nindependent of the treaty of Adrianople, and the former derives much\r\nvalue, not only from the increased security which under any\r\ncircumstances it would give to the right in question, but from the fact,\r\nascertained in the course of the negotiation, that by the construction\r\nput upon that treaty by Turkey the article relating to the passage of\r\nthe Bosphorus is confined to nations having treaties with the Porte. The\r\nmost friendly feelings appear to be entertained by the Sultan, and an\r\nenlightened disposition is evinced by him to foster the intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries by the most liberal arrangements. This\r\ndisposition it will be our duty and interest to cherish.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Russia are of the most stable character. Respect for\r\nthat Empire and confidence in its friendship toward the United States\r\nhave been so long entertained on our part and so carefully cherished by\r\nthe present Emperor and his illustrious predecessor as to have become\r\nincorporated with the public sentiment of the United States. No means\r\nwill be left unemployed on my part to promote these salutary feelings\r\nand those improvements of which the commercial intercourse between the\r\ntwo countries is susceptible, and which have derived increased\r\nimportance from our treaty with the Sublime Porte.\r\n\r\nI sincerely regret to inform you that our minister lately commissioned\r\nto that Court, on whose distinguished talents and great experience in\r\npublic affairs I place great reliance, has been compelled by extreme\r\nindisposition to exercise a privilege which, in consideration of the\r\nextent to which his constitution had been impaired in the public\r\nservice, was committed to his discretion--of leaving temporarily his\r\npost for the advantage of a more genial climate.\r\n\r\nIf, as it is to be hoped, the improvement of his health should be such\r\nas to justify him in doing so, he will repair to St. Petersburg and\r\nresume the discharge of his official duties. I have received the most\r\nsatisfactory assurances that in the meantime the public interest in that\r\nquarter will be preserved from prejudice by the intercourse which he\r\nwill continue through the secretary of legation with the Russian\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nYou are apprised, although the fact has not yet been officially\r\nannounced to the House of Representatives, that a treaty was in the\r\nmonth of March last concluded between the United States and Denmark, by\r\nwhich $650,000 are secured to our citizens as an indemnity for\r\nspoliations upon their commerce in the years 1808, 1809, 1810, and 1811.\r\nThis treaty was sanctioned by the Senate at the close of its last\r\nsession, and it now becomes the duty of Congress to pass the necessary\r\nlaws for the organization of the board of commissioners to distribute\r\nthe indemnity among the claimants. It is an agreeable circumstance in\r\nthis adjustment that the terms are in conformity with the previously\r\nascertained views of the claimants themselves, thus removing all\r\npretense for a future agitation of the subject in any form.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations in regard to such points in our foreign relations as\r\nremain to be adjusted have been actively prosecuted during the recess.\r\nMaterial advances have been made, which are of a character to promise\r\nfavorable results. Our country, by the blessing of God, is not in a\r\nsituation to invite aggression, and it will be our fault if she ever\r\nbecomes so. Sincerely desirous to cultivate the most liberal and\r\nfriendly relations with all; ever ready to fulfill our engagements with\r\nscrupulous fidelity; limiting our demands upon others to mere justice;\r\nholding ourselves ever ready to do unto them as we would wish to be done\r\nby, and avoiding even the appearance of undue partiality to any nation,\r\nit appears to me impossible that a simple and sincere application of our\r\nprinciples to our foreign relations can fail to place them ultimately\r\nupon the footing on which it is our wish they should rest.\r\n\r\nOf the points referred to, the most prominent are our claims upon France\r\nfor spoliations upon our commerce; similar claims upon Spain, together\r\nwith embarrassments in the commercial intercourse between the two\r\ncountries which ought to be removed; the conclusion of the treaty of\r\ncommerce and navigation with Mexico, which has been so long in suspense,\r\nas well as the final settlement of limits between ourselves and that\r\nRepublic, and, finally, the arbitrament of the question between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain in regard to the northeastern boundary.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with France has been conducted by our minister with zeal\r\nand ability, and in all respects to my entire satisfaction. Although the\r\nprospect of a favorable termination was occasionally dimmed by counter\r\npretensions to which the United States could not assent, he yet had\r\nstrong hopes of being able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with\r\nthe late Government. The negotiation has been renewed with the present\r\nauthorities, and, sensible of the general and lively confidence of our\r\ncitizens in the justice and magnanimity of regenerated France, I regret\r\nthe more not to have it in my power yet to announce the result so\r\nconfidently anticipated. No ground, however, inconsistent with this\r\nexpectation has yet been taken, and I do not allow myself to doubt that\r\njustice will soon be done us. The amount of the claims, the length of\r\ntime they have remained unsatisfied, and their incontrovertible justice\r\nmake an earnest prosecution of them by this Government an urgent duty.\r\nThe illegality of the seizures and confiscations out of which they have\r\narisen is not disputed, and whatever distinctions may have heretofore\r\nbeen set up in regard to the liability of the existing Government it is\r\nquite clear that such considerations can not now be interposed.\r\n\r\nThe commercial intercourse between the two countries is susceptible of\r\nhighly advantageous improvements, but the sense of this injury has had,\r\nand must continue to have, a very unfavorable influence upon them. From\r\nits satisfactory adjustment not only a firm and cordial friendship, but\r\na progressive development of all their relations, may be expected. It\r\nis, therefore, my earnest hope that this old and vexatious subject of\r\ndifference may be speedily removed.\r\n\r\nI feel that my confidence in our appeal to the motives which should\r\ngovern a just and magnanimous nation is alike warranted by the character\r\nof the French people and by the high voucher we possess for the enlarged\r\nviews and pure integrity of the Monarch who now presides over their\r\ncouncils, and nothing shall be wanting on my part to meet any\r\nmanifestation of the spirit we anticipate in one of corresponding\r\nfrankness and liberality.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of difference with Spain have been brought to the view of\r\nthat Government by our minister there with much force and propriety, and\r\nthe strongest assurances have been received of their early and favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe steps which remained to place the matter in controversy between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States fairly before the arbitrator have\r\nall been taken in the same liberal and friendly spirit which\r\ncharacterized those before announced. Recent events have doubtless\r\nserved to delay the decision, but our minister at the Court of the\r\ndistinguished arbitrator has been assured that it will be made within\r\nthe time contemplated by the treaty.\r\n\r\nI am particularly gratified in being able to state that a decidedly\r\nfavorable, and, as I hope, lasting, change has been effected in our\r\nrelations with the neighboring Republic of Mexico. The unfortunate and\r\nunfounded suspicions in regard to our disposition which it became my\r\npainful duty to advert to on a former occasion have been, I believe,\r\nentirely removed, and the Government of Mexico has been made to\r\nunderstand the real character of the wishes and views of this in regard\r\nto that country. The consequence is the establishment of friendship and\r\nmutual confidence. Such are the assurances I have received, and I see no\r\ncause to doubt their sincerity.\r\n\r\nI had reason to expect the conclusion of a commercial treaty with Mexico\r\nin season for communication on the present occasion. Circumstances which\r\nare not explained, but which I am persuaded are not the result of an\r\nindisposition on her part to enter into it, have produced the delay.\r\n\r\nThere was reason to fear in the course of the last summer that the\r\nharmony of our relations might be disturbed by the acts of certain\r\nclaimants, under Mexican grants, of territory which had hitherto been\r\nunder our jurisdiction. The cooperation of the representative of Mexico\r\nnear this Government was asked on the occasion and was readily afforded.\r\nInstructions and advice have been given to the governor of Arkansas and\r\nthe officers in command in the adjoining Mexican State by which it is\r\nhoped the quiet of that frontier will be preserved until a final\r\nsettlement of the dividing line shall have removed all ground of\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of ratifications of the treaty concluded last year with\r\nAustria has not yet taken place. The delay has been occasioned by the\r\nnonarrival of the ratification of that Government within the time\r\nprescribed by the treaty. Renewed authority has been asked for by the\r\nrepresentative of Austria, and in the meantime the rapidly increasing\r\ntrade and navigation between the two countries have been placed upon the\r\nmost liberal footing of our navigation acts.\r\n\r\nSeveral alleged depredations have been recently committed on our\r\ncommerce by the national vessels of Portugal. They have been made the\r\nsubject of immediate remonstrance and reclamation. I am not yet\r\npossessed of sufficient information to express a definitive opinion of\r\ntheir character, but expect soon to receive it. No proper means shall be\r\nomitted to obtain for our citizens all the redress to which they may\r\nappear to be entitled.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the moment of the adjournment of your last session two\r\nbills--the one entitled \"An act for making appropriations for building\r\nlight-houses, light-boats, beacons, and monuments, placing buoys, and\r\nfor improving harbors and directing surveys,\" and the other \"An act to\r\nauthorize a subscription for stock in the Louisville and Portland Canal\r\nCompany\"--were submitted for my approval. It was not possible within the\r\ntime allowed me before the close of the session to give to these bills\r\nthe consideration which was due to their character and importance, and I\r\nwas compelled to retain them for that purpose. I now avail myself of\r\nthis early opportunity to return them to the Houses in which they\r\nrespectively originated with the reasons which, after mature\r\ndeliberation, compel me to withhold my approval.\r\n\r\nThe practice of defraying out of the Treasury of the United States the\r\nexpenses incurred by the establishment and support of light-houses,\r\nbeacons, buoys, and public piers within the bays, inlets, harbors, and\r\nports of the United States, to render the navigation thereof safe and\r\neasy, is coeval with the adoption of the Constitution, and has been\r\ncontinued without interruption or dispute.\r\n\r\nAs our foreign commerce increased and was extended into the interior of\r\nthe country by the establishment of ports of entry and delivery upon our\r\nnavigable rivers the sphere of those expenditures received a\r\ncorresponding enlargement. Light-houses, beacons, buoys, public piers,\r\nand the removal of sand bars, sawyers, and other partial or temporary\r\nimpediments in the navigable rivers and harbors which were embraced in\r\nthe revenue districts from time to time established by law were\r\nauthorized upon the same principle and the expense defrayed in the same\r\nmanner. That these expenses have at times been extravagant and\r\ndisproportionate is very probable. The circumstances under which they\r\nare incurred are well calculated to lead to such a result unless their\r\napplication is subjected to the closest scrutiny. The local advantages\r\narising from the disbursement of public money too frequently, it is to\r\nbe feared, invite appropriations for objects of this character that are\r\nneither necessary nor useful.\r\n\r\nThe number of light-house keepers is already very large, and the bill\r\nbefore me proposes to add to it fifty-one more of various descriptions.\r\nFrom representations upon the subject which are understood to be\r\nentitled to respect I am induced to believe that there has not only been\r\ngreat improvidence in the past expenditures of the Government upon these\r\nobjects, but that the security of navigation has in some instances been\r\ndiminished by the multiplication of light-houses and consequent change\r\nof lights upon the coast. It is in this as in other respects our duty to\r\navoid all unnecessary expense, as well as every increase of patronage\r\nnot called for by the public service. But in the discharge of that duty\r\nin this particular it must not be forgotten that in relation to our\r\nforeign commerce the burden and benefit of protecting and accommodating\r\nit necessarily go together, and must do so as long as the public revenue\r\nis drawn from the people through the custom-house. It is indisputable\r\nthat whatever gives facility and security to navigation cheapens\r\nimports, and all who consume them are alike interested in whatever\r\nproduces this effect. If they consume, they ought, as they now do, to\r\npay; otherwise they do not pay. The consumer in the most inland State\r\nderives the same advantage from every necessary and prudent expenditure\r\nfor the facility and security of our foreign commerce and navigation\r\nthat he does who resides in a maritime State. Local expenditures have\r\nnot of themselves a corresponding operation.\r\n\r\nFrom a bill making _direct_ appropriations for such objects I should not\r\nhave withheld my assent. The one now returned does so in several\r\nparticulars, but it also contains appropriations for surveys of a local\r\ncharacter, which I can not approve. It gives me satisfaction to find\r\nthat no serious inconvenience has arisen from withholding my approval\r\nfrom this bill; nor will it, I trust, be cause of regret that an\r\nopportunity will be thereby afforded for Congress to review its\r\nprovisions under circumstances better calculated for full investigation\r\nthan those under which it was passed.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of direct appropriations I mean not to include a practice\r\nwhich has obtained to some extent, and to which I have in one instance,\r\nin a different capacity, given my assent--that of subscribing to the\r\nstock of private associations. Positive experience and a more thorough\r\nconsideration of the subject have convinced me of the impropriety as\r\nwell as inexpediency of such investments. All improvements effected by\r\nthe funds of the nation for general use should be open to the enjoyment\r\nof all our fellow-citizens, exempt from the payment of tolls or any\r\nimposition of that character. The practice of thus mingling the concerns\r\nof the Government with those of the States or of individuals is\r\ninconsistent with the object of its institution and highly impolitic.\r\nThe successful operation of the federal system can only be preserved by\r\nconfining it to the few and simple, but yet important, objects for which\r\nit was designed.\r\n\r\nA different practice, if allowed to progress, would ultimately change\r\nthe character of this Government by consolidating into one the General\r\nand State Governments, which were intended to be kept forever distinct.\r\nI can not perceive how bills authorizing such subscriptions can be\r\notherwise regarded than as bills for revenue, and consequently subject\r\nto the rule in that respect prescribed by the Constitution. If the\r\ninterest of the Government in private companies is subordinate to that\r\nof individuals, the management and control of a portion of the public\r\nfunds is delegated to an authority unknown to the Constitution and\r\nbeyond the supervision of our constituents; if superior, its officers\r\nand agents will be constantly exposed to imputations of favoritism and\r\noppression. Direct prejudice to the public interest or an alienation of\r\nthe affections and respect of portions of the people may, therefore, in\r\naddition to the general discredit resulting to the Government from\r\nembarking with its constituents in pecuniary stipulations, be looked for\r\nas the probable fruit of such associations. It is no answer to this\r\nobjection to say that the extent of consequences like these can not be\r\ngreat from a limited and small number of investments, because experience\r\nin other matters teaches us--and we are not at liberty to disregard its\r\nadmonitions--that unless an entire stop be put to them it will soon be\r\nimpossible to prevent their accumulation until they are spread over the\r\nwhole country and made to embrace many of the private and appropriate\r\nconcerns of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe power which the General Government would acquire within the several\r\nStates by becoming the principal stockholder in corporations,\r\ncontrolling every canal and each 60 or 100 miles of every important\r\nroad, and giving a proportionate vote in all their elections, is almost\r\ninconceivable, and in my view dangerous to the liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nThis mode of aiding such works is also in its nature deceptive, and in\r\nmany cases conducive to improvidence in the administration of the\r\nnational funds. Appropriations will be obtained with much greater\r\nfacility and granted with less security to the public interest when the\r\nmeasure is thus disguised than when definite and direct expenditures of\r\nmoney are asked for. The interests of the nation would doubtless be\r\nbetter served by avoiding all such indirect modes of aiding particular\r\nobjects. In a government like ours more especially should all public\r\nacts be, as far as practicable, simple, undisguised, and intelligible,\r\nthat they may become fit subjects for the approbation or animadversion\r\nof the people. The bill authorizing a subscription to the Louisville and\r\nPortland Canal affords a striking illustration of the difficulty of\r\nwithholding additional appropriations for the same object when the first\r\nerroneous step has been taken by instituting a partnership between the\r\nGovernment and private companies. It proposes a third subscription on\r\nthe part of the United States, when each preceding one was at the time\r\nregarded as the extent of the aid which Government was to render to that\r\nwork; and the accompanying bill for light-houses, etc., contains an\r\nappropriation for a survey of the bed of the river, with a view to its\r\nimprovement by removing the obstruction which the canal is designed to\r\navoid. This improvement, if successful, would afford a free passage of\r\nthe river and render the canal entirely useless. To such improvidence is\r\nthe course of legislation subject in relation to internal improvements\r\non local matters, even with the best intentions on the part of Congress.\r\n\r\nAlthough the motives which have influenced me in this matter may be\r\nalready sufficiently stated, I am, nevertheless, induced by its\r\nimportance to add a few observations of a general character.\r\n\r\nIn my objections to the bills authorizing subscriptions to the Maysville\r\nand Rockville road companies I expressed my views fully in regard to the\r\npower of Congress to construct roads and canals within a State or to\r\nappropriate money for improvements of a local character. I at the same\r\ntime intimated my belief that the right to make appropriations for such\r\nas were of a national character had been so generally acted upon and so\r\nlong acquiesced in by the Federal and State Governments and the\r\nconstituents of each as to justify its exercise on the ground of\r\ncontinued and uninterrupted usage, but that it was, nevertheless, highly\r\nexpedient that appropriations even of that character should, with the\r\nexception made at the time, be deferred until the national debt is paid,\r\nand that in the meanwhile some general rule for the action of the\r\nGovernment in that respect ought to be established.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions were not necessary to the decision of the question\r\nthen before me, and were, I readily admit, intended to awake the\r\nattention and draw forth the opinions and observations of our\r\nconstituents upon a subject of the highest importance to their\r\ninterests, and one destined to exert a powerful influence upon the\r\nfuture operations of our political system. I know of no tribunal to\r\nwhich a public man in this country, in a case of doubt and difficulty,\r\ncan appeal with greater advantage or more propriety than the judgment of\r\nthe people; and although I must necessarily in the discharge of my\r\nofficial duties be governed by the dictates of my own judgment, I have\r\nno desire to conceal my anxious wish to conform as far as I can to the\r\nviews of those for whom I act.\r\n\r\nAll irregular expressions of public opinion are of necessity attended\r\nwith some doubt as to their accuracy, but making full allowances on that\r\naccount I can not, I think, deceive myself in believing that the acts\r\nreferred to, as well as the suggestions which I allowed myself to make\r\nin relation to their bearing upon the future operations of the\r\nGovernment, have been approved by the great body of the people. That\r\nthose whose immediate pecuniary interests are to be affected by proposed\r\nexpenditures should shrink from the application of a rule which prefers\r\ntheir more general and remote interests to those which are personal and\r\nimmediate is to be expected. But even such objections must from the\r\nnature of our population be but temporary in their duration, and if it\r\nwere otherwise our course should be the same, for the time is yet, I\r\nhope, far distant when those intrusted with power to be exercised for\r\nthe good of the whole will consider it either honest or wise to purchase\r\nlocal favors at the sacrifice of principle and general good.\r\n\r\nSo understanding public sentiment, and thoroughly satisfied that the\r\nbest interests of our common country imperiously require that the course\r\nwhich I have recommended in this regard should be adopted, I have, upon\r\nthe most mature consideration, determined to pursue it.\r\n\r\nIt is due to candor, as well as to my own feelings, that I should\r\nexpress the reluctance and anxiety which I must at all times experience\r\nin exercising the undoubted right of the Executive to withhold his\r\nassent from bills on other grounds than their constitutionality. That\r\nthis right should not be exercised on slight occasions all will admit.\r\nIt is only in matters of deep interest, when the principle involved may\r\nbe justly regarded as next in importance to infractions of the\r\nConstitution itself, that such a step can be expected to meet with the\r\napprobation of the people. Such an occasion do I conscientiously believe\r\nthe present to be. In the discharge of this delicate and highly\r\nresponsible duty I am sustained by the reflection that the exercise of\r\nthis power has been deemed consistent with the obligation of official\r\nduty by several of my predecessors, and by the persuasion, too, that\r\nwhatever liberal institutions may have to fear from the encroachments of\r\nExecutive power, which has been everywhere the cause of so much strife\r\nand bloody contention, but little danger is to be apprehended from a\r\nprecedent by which that authority denies to itself the exercise of\r\npowers that bring in their train influence and patronage of great\r\nextent, and thus excludes the operation of personal interests,\r\neverywhere the bane of official trust. I derive, too, no small degree of\r\nsatisfaction from the reflection that if I have mistaken the interests\r\nand wishes of the people the Constitution affords the means of soon\r\nredressing the error by selecting for the place their favor has bestowed\r\nupon me a citizen whose opinions may accord with their own. I trust, in\r\nthe meantime, the interests of the nation will be saved from prejudice\r\nby a rigid application of that portion of the public funds which might\r\notherwise be applied to different objects to that highest of all our\r\nobligations, the payment of the public debt, and an opportunity be\r\nafforded for the adoption of some better rule for the operations of the\r\nGovernment in this matter than any which has hitherto been acted upon.\r\n\r\nProfoundly impressed with the importance of the subject, not merely as\r\nrelates to the general prosperity of the country, but to the safety of\r\nthe federal system, I can not avoid repeating my earnest hope that all\r\ngood citizens who take a proper interest in the success and harmony of\r\nour admirable political institutions, and who are incapable of desiring\r\nto convert an opposite state of things into means for the gratification\r\nof personal ambition, will, laying aside minor considerations and\r\ndiscarding local prejudices, unite their honest exertions to establish\r\nsome fixed general principle which shall be calculated to effect the\r\ngreatest extent of public good in regard to the subject of internal\r\nimprovement, and afford the least ground for sectional discontent.\r\n\r\nThe general grounds of my objection to local appropriations have been\r\nheretofore expressed, and I shall endeavor to avoid a repetition of what\r\nhas been already urged--the importance of sustaining the State\r\nsovereignties as far as is consistent with the rightful action of the\r\nFederal Government, and of preserving the greatest attainable harmony\r\nbetween them. I will now only add an expression of my conviction--a\r\nconviction which every day's experience serves to confirm--that the\r\npolitical creed which inculcates the pursuit of those great objects as a\r\nparamount duty is the true faith, and one to which we are mainly\r\nindebted for the present success of the entire system, and to which we\r\nmust alone look for its future stability.\r\n\r\nThat there are diversities in the interests of the different States\r\nwhich compose this extensive Confederacy must be admitted. Those\r\ndiversities arising from situation, climate, population, and pursuits\r\nare doubtless, as it is natural they should be, greatly exaggerated by\r\njealousies and that spirit of rivalry so inseparable from neighboring\r\ncommunities. These circumstances make it the duty of those who are\r\nintrusted with the management of its affairs to neutralize their effects\r\nas far as practicable by making the beneficial operation of the Federal\r\nGovernment as equal and equitable among the several States as can be\r\ndone consistently with the great ends of its institution.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to refer to undoubted facts to see how far the past\r\nacts of the Government upon the subject under consideration have fallen\r\nshort of this object. The expenditures heretofore made for internal\r\nimprovements amount to upward of $5,000,000, and have been distributed\r\nin very unequal proportions amongst the States. The estimated expense of\r\nworks of which surveys have been made, together with that of others\r\nprojected and partially surveyed, amounts to more than $96,000,000.\r\n\r\nThat such improvements, on account of particular circumstances, may be\r\nmore advantageously and beneficially made in some States than in others\r\nis doubtless true, but that they are of a character which should prevent\r\nan equitable distribution of the funds amongst the several States is not\r\nto be conceded. The want of this equitable distribution can not fail to\r\nprove a prolific source of irritation among the States.\r\n\r\nWe have it constantly before our eyes that professions of superior zeal\r\nin the cause of internal improvement and a disposition to lavish the\r\npublic funds upon objects of this character are daily and earnestly put\r\nforth by aspirants to power as constituting the highest claims to the\r\nconfidence of the people. Would it be strange, under such circumstances,\r\nand in times of great excitement, that grants of this description should\r\nfind their motives in objects which may not accord with the public good?\r\nThose who have not had occasion to see and regret the indication of a\r\nsinister influence in these matters in past times have been more\r\nfortunate than myself in their observation of the course of public\r\naffairs. If to these evils be added the combinations and angry\r\ncontentions to which such a course of things gives rise, with their\r\nbaleful influences upon the legislation of Congress touching the leading\r\nand appropriate duties of the Federal Government, it was but doing\r\njustice to the character of our people to expect the severe condemnation\r\nof the past which the recent exhibitions of public sentiment has\r\nevinced.\r\n\r\nNothing short of a radical change in the action of the Government upon\r\nthe subject can, in my opinion, remedy the evil. If, as it would be\r\nnatural to expect, the States which have been least favored in past\r\nappropriations should insist on being redressed in those hereafter to be\r\nmade, at the expense of the States which have so largely and\r\ndisproportionately participated, we have, as matters now stand, but\r\nlittle security that the attempt would do more than change the\r\ninequality from one quarter to another.\r\n\r\nThus viewing the subject, I have heretofore felt it my duty to recommend\r\nthe adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus funds,\r\nwhich may at any time remain in the Treasury after the national debt\r\nshall have been paid, among the States, in proportion to the number of\r\ntheir Representatives, to be applied by them to objects of internal\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nAlthough this plan has met with favor in some portions of the Union, it\r\nhas also elicited objections which merit deliberate consideration. A\r\nbrief notice of these objections here will not, therefore, I trust, be\r\nregarded as out of place.\r\n\r\nThey rest, as far as they have come to my knowledge, on the following\r\ngrounds: First, an objection to the ratio of distribution; second, an\r\napprehension that the existence of such a regulation would produce\r\nimprovident and oppressive taxation to raise the funds for distribution;\r\nthird, that the mode proposed would lead to the construction of works of\r\na local nature, to the exclusion of such as are general and as would\r\nconsequently be of a more useful character; and, last, that it would\r\ncreate a discreditable and injurious dependence on the part of the State\r\ngovernments upon the Federal power. Of those who object to the ratio of\r\nrepresentation as the basis of distribution, some insist that the\r\nimportations of the respective States would constitute one that would be\r\nmore equitable; and others again, that the extent of their respective\r\nterritories would furnish a standard which would be more expedient and\r\nsufficiently equitable. The ratio of representation presented itself to\r\nmy mind, and it still does, as one of obvious equity, because of its\r\nbeing the ratio of contribution, whether the funds to be distributed be\r\nderived from the customs or from direct taxation. It does not follow,\r\nhowever, that its adoption is indispensable to the establishment of the\r\nsystem proposed. There may be considerations appertaining to the subject\r\nwhich would render a departure, to some extent, from the rule of\r\ncontribution proper. Nor is it absolutely necessary that the basis of\r\ndistribution be confined to one ground. It may, if in the judgment of\r\nthose whose right it is to fix it be deemed politic and just to give\r\nit that character, have regard to several.\r\n\r\nIn my first message I stated it to be my opinion that \"it is not\r\nprobable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principles satisfactory\r\nto the people of the Union will until a remote period, if ever, leave\r\nthe Government without a considerable surplus in the Treasury beyond\r\nwhat may be required for its current service.\" I have had no cause to\r\nchange that opinion, but much to confirm it. Should these expectations\r\nbe realized, a suitable fund would thus be produced for the plan under\r\nconsideration to operate upon, and if there be no such fund its adoption\r\nwill, in my opinion, work no injury to any interest; for I can not\r\nassent to the justness of the apprehension that the establishment of the\r\nproposed system would tend to the encouragement of improvident\r\nlegislation of the character supposed. Whatever the proper authority in\r\nthe exercise of constitutional power shall at any time hereafter decide\r\nto be for the general good will in that as in other respects deserve and\r\nreceive the acquiescence and support of the whole country, and we have\r\nample security that every abuse of power in that regard by agents of the\r\npeople will receive a speedy and effectual corrective at their hands.\r\nThe views which I take of the future, founded on the obvious and\r\nincreasing improvement of all classes of our fellow-citizens in\r\nintelligence and in public and private virtue, leave me without much\r\napprehension on that head.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that those who come after us will be as much alive as we\r\nare to the obligation upon all the trustees of political power to exempt\r\nthose for whom they act from all unnecessary burthens, and as sensible\r\nof the great truth that the resources of the nation beyond those\r\nrequired for immediate and necessary purposes of Government can nowhere\r\nbe so well deposited as in the pockets of the people.\r\n\r\nIt may sometimes happen that the interests of particular States would\r\nnot be deemed to coincide with the general interest in relation to\r\nimprovements within such States. But if the danger to be apprehended\r\nfrom this source is sufficient to require it, a discretion might be\r\nreserved to Congress to direct to such improvements of a general\r\ncharacter as the States concerned might not be disposed to unite in, the\r\napplication of the quotas of those States, under the restriction of\r\nconfining to each State the expenditure of its appropriate quota. It\r\nmay, however, be assumed as a safe general rule that such improvements\r\nas serve to increase the prosperity of the respective States in which\r\nthey are made, by giving new facilities to trade, and thereby augmenting\r\nthe wealth and comfort of their inhabitants, constitute the surest mode\r\nof conferring permanent and substantial advantages upon the whole. The\r\nstrength as well as the true glory of the Confederacy is founded on the\r\nprosperity and power of the several independent sovereignties of which\r\nit is composed and the certainty with which they can be brought into\r\nsuccessful active cooperation through the agency of the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, within the knowledge of such as are at all conversant\r\nwith public affairs that schemes of internal improvement have from time\r\nto time been proposed which, from their extent and seeming magnificence,\r\nwere readily regarded as of national concernment, but which upon fuller\r\nconsideration and further experience would now be rejected with great\r\nunanimity.\r\n\r\nThat the plan under consideration would derive important advantages from\r\nits certainty, and that the moneys set apart for these purposes would be\r\nmore judiciously applied and economically expended under the direction\r\nof the State legislatures, in which every part of each State is\r\nimmediately represented, can not, I think, be doubted. In the new States\r\nparticularly, where a comparatively small population is scattered over\r\nan extensive surface, and the representation in Congress consequently\r\nvery limited, it is natural to expect that the appropriations made by\r\nthe Federal Government would be more likely to be expended in the\r\nvicinity of those members through whose immediate agency they were\r\nobtained than if the funds were placed under the control of the\r\nlegislature, in which every county of the State has its own\r\nrepresentative. This supposition does not necessarily impugn the motives\r\nof such Congressional representatives, nor is it so intended. We are all\r\nsensible of the bias to which the strongest minds and purest hearts are,\r\nunder such circumstances, liable. In respect to the last objection--its\r\nprobable effect upon the dignity and independence of State\r\ngovernments--it appears to me only necessary to state the case as it is,\r\nand as it would be if the measure proposed were adopted, to show that\r\nthe operation is most likely to be the very reverse of that which the\r\nobjection supposes.\r\n\r\nIn the one case the State would receive its quota of the national\r\nrevenue for domestic use upon a fixed principle as a matter of right,\r\nand from a fund to the creation of which it had itself contributed its\r\nfair proportion. Surely there could be nothing derogatory in that. As\r\nmatters now stand the States themselves, in their sovereign character,\r\nare not unfrequently petitioners at the bar of the Federal Legislature\r\nfor such allowances out of the National Treasury as it may comport with\r\ntheir pleasure or sense of duty to bestow upon them. It can not require\r\nargument to prove which of the two courses is most compatible with the\r\nefficiency or respectability of the State governments.\r\n\r\nBut all these are matters for discussion and dispassionate\r\nconsideration. That the desired adjustment would be attended with\r\ndifficulty affords no reason why it should not be attempted. The\r\neffective operation of such motives would have prevented the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution under which we have so long lived and under the benign\r\ninfluence of which our beloved country has so signally prospered. The\r\nframers of that sacred instrument had greater difficulties to overcome,\r\nand they did overcome them. The patriotism of the people, directed by a\r\ndeep conviction of the importance of the Union, produced mutual\r\nconcession and reciprocal forbearance. Strict right was merged in a\r\nspirit of compromise, and the result has consecrated their disinterested\r\ndevotion to the general weal. Unless the American people have\r\ndegenerated, the same result can be again effected whenever experience\r\npoints out the necessity of a resort to the same means to uphold the\r\nfabric which their fathers have reared. It is beyond the power of man to\r\nmake a system of government like ours or any other operate with precise\r\nequality upon States situated like those which compose this Confederacy;\r\nnor is inequality always injustice. Every State can not expect to shape\r\nthe measures of the General Government to suit its own particular\r\ninterests. The causes which prevent it are seated in the nature of\r\nthings, and can not be entirely counteracted by human means. Mutual\r\nforbearance becomes, therefore, a duty obligatory upon all, and we may,\r\nI am confident, count upon a cheerful compliance with this high\r\ninjunction on the part of our constituents. It is not to be supposed\r\nthat they will object to make such comparatively inconsiderable\r\nsacrifices for the preservation of rights and privileges which other\r\nless favored portions of the world have in vain waded through seas of\r\nblood to acquire.\r\n\r\nOur course is a safe one if it be but faithfully adhered to.\r\nAcquiescence in the constitutionally expressed will of the majority, and\r\nthe exercise of that will in a spirit of moderation, justice, and\r\nbrotherly kindness, will constitute a cement which would forever\r\npreserve our Union. Those who cherish and inculcate sentiments like\r\nthese render a most essential service to their country, while those who\r\nseek to weaken their influence are, however conscientious and\r\npraiseworthy their intentions, in effect its worst enemies.\r\n\r\nIf the intelligence and influence of the country, instead of laboring to\r\nfoment sectional prejudices, to be made subservient to party warfare,\r\nwere in good faith applied to the eradication of causes of local\r\ndiscontent, by the improvement of our institutions and by facilitating\r\ntheir adaptation to the condition of the times, this task would prove\r\none of less difficulty. May we not hope that the obvious interests of\r\nour common country and the dictates of an enlightened patriotism will in\r\nthe end lead the public mind in that direction?\r\n\r\nAfter all, the nature of the subject does not admit of a plan wholly\r\nfree from objection. That which has for some time been in operation is,\r\nperhaps, the worst that could exist, and every advance that can be made\r\nin its improvement is a matter eminently worthy of your most deliberate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that one better calculated to effect the objects in\r\nview may yet be devised. If so, it is to be hoped that those who\r\ndisapprove the past and dissent from what is proposed for the future\r\nwill feel it their duty to direct their attention to it, as they must be\r\nsensible that unless some fixed rule for the action of the Federal\r\nGovernment in this respect is established the course now attempted to be\r\narrested will be again resorted to. Any mode which is calculated to give\r\nthe greatest degree of effect and harmony to our legislation upon the\r\nsubject, which shall best serve to keep the movements of the Federal\r\nGovernment within the sphere intended by those who modeled and those who\r\nadopted it, which shall lead to the extinguishment of the national debt\r\nin the shortest period and impose the lightest burthens upon our\r\nconstituents, shall receive from me a cordial and firm support.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of great national concern I can not omit to press\r\nagain upon your attention that part of the Constitution which regulates\r\nthe election of President and Vice-President. The necessity for its\r\namendment is made so clear to my mind by observation of its evils and by\r\nthe many able discussions which they have elicited on the floor of\r\nCongress and elsewhere that I should be wanting to my duty were I to\r\nwithhold another expression of my deep solicitude on the subject. Our\r\nsystem fortunately contemplates a recurrence to first principles,\r\ndiffering in this respect from all that have preceded it, and securing\r\nit, I trust, equally against the decay and the commotions which have\r\nmarked the progress of other governments. Our fellow-citizens, too, who\r\nin proportion to their love of liberty keep a steady eye upon the means\r\nof sustaining it, do not require to be reminded of the duty they owe to\r\nthemselves to remedy all essential defects in so vital a part of their\r\nsystem. While they are sensible that every evil attendant upon its\r\noperation is not necessarily indicative of a bad organization, but may\r\nproceed from temporary causes, yet the habitual presence, or even a\r\nsingle instance, of evils which can be clearly traced to an organic\r\ndefect will not, I trust, be overlooked through a too scrupulous\r\nveneration for the work of their ancestors. The Constitution was an\r\nexperiment committed to the virtue and intelligence of the great mass of\r\nour countrymen, in whose ranks the framers of it themselves were to\r\nperform the part of patriotic observation and scrutiny, and if they have\r\npassed from the stage of existence with an increased confidence in its\r\ngeneral adaptation to our condition we should learn from authority so\r\nhigh the duty of fortifying the points in it which time proves to be\r\nexposed rather than be deterred from approaching them by the suggestions\r\nof fear or the dictates of misplaced reverence.\r\n\r\nA provision which does not secure to the people a direct choice of their\r\nChief Magistrate, but has a tendency to defeat their will, presented to\r\nmy mind such an inconsistency with the general spirit of our\r\ninstitutions that I was induced to suggest for your consideration the\r\nsubstitute which appeared to me at the same time the most likely to\r\ncorrect the evil and to meet the views of our constituents. The most\r\nmature reflection since has added strength to the belief that the best\r\ninterests of our country require the speedy adoption of some plan\r\ncalculated to effect this end. A contingency which sometimes places it\r\nin the power of a single member of the House of Representatives to\r\ndecide an election of so high and solemn a character is unjust to the\r\npeople, and becomes when it occurs a source of embarrassment to the\r\nindividuals thus brought into power and a cause of distrust of the\r\nrepresentative body. Liable as the Confederacy is, from its great\r\nextent, to parties founded upon sectional interests, and to a\r\ncorresponding multiplication of candidates for the Presidency, the\r\ntendency of the constitutional reference to the House of Representatives\r\nis to devolve the election upon that body in almost every instance, and,\r\nwhatever choice may then be made among the candidates thus presented to\r\nthem, to swell the influence of particular interests to a degree\r\ninconsistent with the general good. The consequences of this feature of\r\nthe Constitution appear far more threatening to the peace and integrity\r\nof the Union than any which I can conceive as likely to result from the\r\nsimple legislative action of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nIt was a leading object with the framers of the Constitution to keep as\r\nseparate as possible the action of the legislative and executive\r\nbranches of the Government. To secure this object nothing is more\r\nessential than to preserve the former from all temptations of private\r\ninterest, and therefore so to direct the patronage of the latter as not\r\nto permit such temptations to be offered. Experience abundantly\r\ndemonstrates that every precaution in this respect is a valuable\r\nsafeguard of liberty, and one which my reflections upon the tendencies\r\nof our system incline me to think should be made still stronger. It was\r\nfor this reason that, in connection with an amendment of the\r\nConstitution removing all intermediate agency in the choice of the\r\nPresident, I recommended some restrictions upon the reeligibility of\r\nthat officer and upon the tenure of offices generally. The reason still\r\nexists, and I renew the recommendation with an increased confidence that\r\nits adoption will strengthen those checks by which the Constitution\r\ndesigned to secure the independence of each department of the Government\r\nand promote the healthful and equitable administration of all the trusts\r\nwhich it has created. The agent most likely to contravene this design of\r\nthe Constitution is the Chief Magistrate. In order, particularly, that\r\nhis appointment may as far as possible be placed beyond the reach of any\r\nimproper influences; in order that he may approach the solemn\r\nresponsibilities of the highest office in the gift of a free people\r\nuncommitted to any other course than the strict line of constitutional\r\nduty, and that the securities for this independence may be rendered as\r\nstrong as the nature of power and the weakness of its possessor will\r\nadmit, I can not too earnestly invite your attention to the propriety of\r\npromoting such an amendment of the Constitution as will render him\r\nineligible after one term of service.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to announce to Congress that the benevolent policy\r\nof the Government, steadily pursued for nearly thirty years, in relation\r\nto the removal of the Indians beyond the white settlements is\r\napproaching to a happy consummation. Two important tribes have accepted\r\nthe provision made for their removal at the last session of Congress,\r\nand it is believed that their example will induce the remaining tribes\r\nalso to seek the same obvious advantages.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of a speedy removal will be important to the United\r\nStates, to individual States, and to the Indians themselves. The\r\npecuniary advantages which it promises to the Government are the least\r\nof its recommendations. It puts an end to all possible danger of\r\ncollision between the authorities of the General and State Governments\r\non account of the Indians. It will place a dense and civilized\r\npopulation in large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage\r\nhunters. By opening the whole territory between Tennessee on the north\r\nand Louisiana on the south to the settlement of the whites it will\r\nincalculably strengthen the southwestern frontier and render the\r\nadjacent States strong enough to repel future invasions without remote\r\naid. It will relieve the whole State of Mississippi and the western part\r\nof Alabama of Indian occupancy, and enable those States to advance\r\nrapidly in population, wealth, and power. It will separate the Indians\r\nfrom immediate contact with settlements of whites; free them from the\r\npower of the States; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way\r\nand under their own rude institutions; will retard the progress of\r\ndecay, which is lessening their numbers, and perhaps cause them\r\ngradually, under the protection of the Government and through the\r\ninfluence of good counsels, to cast off their savage habits and become\r\nan interesting, civilized, and Christian community. These consequences,\r\nsome of them so certain and the rest so probable, make the complete\r\nexecution of the plan sanctioned by Congress at their last session an\r\nobject of much solicitude.\r\n\r\nToward the aborigines of the country no one can indulge a more friendly\r\nfeeling than myself, or would go further in attempting to reclaim them\r\nfrom their wandering habits and make them a happy, prosperous people. I\r\nhave endeavored to impress upon them my own solemn convictions of the\r\nduties and powers of the General Government in relation to the State\r\nauthorities. For the justice of the laws passed by the States within the\r\nscope of their reserved powers they are not responsible to this\r\nGovernment. As individuals we may entertain and express our opinions of\r\ntheir acts, but as a Government we have as little right to control them\r\nas we have to prescribe laws for other nations.\r\n\r\nWith a full understanding of the subject, the Choctaw and the Chickasaw\r\ntribes have with great unanimity determined to avail themselves of the\r\nliberal offers presented by the act of Congress, and have agreed to\r\nremove beyond the Mississippi River. Treaties have been made with them,\r\nwhich in due season will be submitted for consideration. In negotiating\r\nthese treaties they were made to understand their true condition, and\r\nthey have preferred maintaining their independence in the Western\r\nforests to submitting to the laws of the States in which they now\r\nreside. These treaties, being probably the last which will ever be made\r\nwith them, are characterized by great liberality on the part of the\r\nGovernment. They give the Indians a liberal sum in consideration of\r\ntheir removal, and comfortable subsistence on their arrival at their new\r\nhomes. If it be their real interest to maintain a separate existence,\r\nthey will there be at liberty to do so without the inconveniences and\r\nvexations to which they would unavoidably have been subject in Alabama\r\nand Mississippi.\r\n\r\nHumanity has often wept over the fate of the aborigines of this country,\r\nand Philanthropy has been long busily employed in devising means to\r\navert it, but its progress has never for a moment been arrested, and one\r\nby one have many powerful tribes disappeared from the earth. To follow\r\nto the tomb the last of his race and to tread on the graves of extinct\r\nnations excite melancholy reflections. But true philanthropy reconciles\r\nthe mind to these vicissitudes as it does to the extinction of one\r\ngeneration to make room for another. In the monuments and fortresses of\r\nan unknown people, spread over the extensive regions of the West, we\r\nbehold the memorials of a once powerful race, which was exterminated or\r\nhas disappeared to make room for the existing savage tribes. Nor is\r\nthere anything in this which, upon a comprehensive view of the general\r\ninterests of the human race, is to be regretted. Philanthropy could not\r\nwish to see this continent restored to the condition in which it was\r\nfound by our forefathers. What good man would prefer a country covered\r\nwith forests and ranged by a few thousand savages to our extensive\r\nRepublic, studded with cities, towns, and prosperous farms, embellished\r\nwith all the improvements which art can devise or industry execute,\r\noccupied by more than 12,000,000 happy people, and filled with all the\r\nblessings of liberty, civilization, and religion?\r\n\r\nThe present policy of the Government is but a continuation of the same\r\nprogressive change by a milder process. The tribes which occupied the\r\ncountries now constituting the Eastern States were annihilated or have\r\nmelted away to make room for the whites. The waves of population and\r\ncivilization are rolling to the westward, and we now propose to acquire\r\nthe countries occupied by the red men of the South and West by a fair\r\nexchange, and, at the expense of the United States, to send them to a\r\nland where their existence may be prolonged and perhaps made perpetual.\r\nDoubtless it will be painful to leave the graves of their fathers; but\r\nwhat do they more than our ancestors did or than our children are now\r\ndoing? To better their condition in an unknown land our forefathers left\r\nall that was dear in earthly objects. Our children by thousands yearly\r\nleave the land of their birth to seek new homes in distant regions. Does\r\nHumanity weep at these painful separations from everything, animate and\r\ninanimate, with which the young heart has become entwined? Far from it.\r\nIt is rather a source of joy that our country affords scope where our\r\nyoung population may range unconstrained in body or in mind, developing\r\nthe power and faculties of man in their highest perfection. These remove\r\nhundreds and almost thousands of miles at their own expense, purchase\r\nthe lands they occupy, and support themselves at their new homes from\r\nthe moment of their arrival. Can it be cruel in this Government when, by\r\nevents which it can not control, the Indian is made discontented in his\r\nancient home to purchase his lands, to give him a new and extensive\r\nterritory, to pay the expense of his removal, and support him a year in\r\nhis new abode? How many thousands of our own people would gladly embrace\r\nthe opportunity of removing to the West on such condition! If the offers\r\nmade to the Indians were extended to them, they would be hailed with\r\ngratitude and joy.\r\n\r\nAnd is it supposed that the wandering savage has a stronger attachment\r\nto his home than the settled, civilized Christian? Is it more afflicting\r\nto him to leave the graves of his fathers than it is to our brothers and\r\nchildren? Rightly considered, the policy of the General Government\r\ntoward the red man is not only liberal, but generous. He is unwilling to\r\nsubmit to the laws of the States and mingle with their population. To\r\nsave him from this alternative, or perhaps utter annihilation, the\r\nGeneral Government kindly offers him a new home, and proposes to pay the\r\nwhole expense of his removal and settlement.\r\n\r\nIn the consummation of a policy originating at an early period, and\r\nsteadily pursued by every Administration within the present century--so\r\njust to the States and so generous to the Indians--the Executive feels\r\nit has a right to expect the cooperation of Congress and of all good and\r\ndisinterested men. The States, moreover, have a right to demand it. It\r\nwas substantially a part of the compact which made them members of our\r\nConfederacy. With Georgia there is an express contract; with the new\r\nStates an implied one of equal obligation. Why, in authorizing Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi, and Alabama to form\r\nconstitutions and become separate States, did Congress include within\r\ntheir limits extensive tracts of Indian lands, and, in some instances,\r\npowerful Indian tribes? Was it not understood by both parties that the\r\npower of the States was to be coextensive with their limits, and that\r\nwith all convenient dispatch the General Government should extinguish\r\nthe Indian title and remove every obstruction to the complete\r\njurisdiction of the State governments over the soil? Probably not one of\r\nthose States would have accepted a separate existence--certainly it\r\nwould never have been granted by Congress--had it been understood that\r\nthey were to be confined forever to those small portions of their\r\nnominal territory the Indian title to which had at the time been\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, a duty which this Government owes to the new States to\r\nextinguish as soon as possible the Indian title to all lands which\r\nCongress themselves have included within their limits. When this is done\r\nthe duties of the General Government in relation to the States and the\r\nIndians within their limits are at an end. The Indians may leave the\r\nState or not, as they choose. The purchase of their lands does not alter\r\nin the least their personal relations with the State government. No act\r\nof the General Government has ever been deemed necessary to give the\r\nStates jurisdiction over the persons of the Indians. That they possess\r\nby virtue of their sovereign power within their own limits in as full a\r\nmanner before as after the purchase of the Indian lands; nor can this\r\nGovernment add to or diminish it.\r\n\r\nMay we not hope, therefore, that all good citizens, and none more\r\nzealously than those who think the Indians oppressed by subjection to\r\nthe laws of the States, will unite in attempting to open the eyes of\r\nthose children of the forest to their true condition, and by a speedy\r\nremoval to relieve them from all the evils, real or imaginary, present\r\nor prospective, with which they may be supposed to be threatened.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous causes of congratulation the condition of our impost\r\nrevenue deserves special mention, inasmuch as it promises the means of\r\nextinguishing the public debt sooner than was anticipated, and furnishes\r\na strong illustration of the practical effects of the present tariff\r\nupon our commercial interests.\r\n\r\nThe object of the tariff is objected to by some as unconstitutional, and\r\nit is considered by almost all as defective in many of its parts.\r\n\r\nThe power to impose duties on imports originally belonged to the several\r\nStates. The right to adjust those duties with a view to the\r\nencouragement of domestic branches of industry is so completely\r\nincidental to that power that it is difficult to suppose the existence\r\nof the one without the other. The States have delegated their whole\r\nauthority over imports to the General Government without limitation or\r\nrestriction, saving the very inconsiderable reservation relating to\r\ntheir inspection laws. This authority having thus entirely passed from\r\nthe States, the right to exercise it for the purpose of protection does\r\nnot exist in them, and consequently if it be not possessed by the\r\nGeneral Government it must be extinct. Our political system would thus\r\npresent the anomaly of a people stripped of the right to foster their\r\nown industry and to counteract the most selfish and destructive policy\r\nwhich might be adopted by foreign nations. This surely can not be the\r\ncase. This indispensable power thus surrendered by the States must be\r\nwithin the scope of the authority on the subject expressly delegated to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn this conclusion I am confirmed as well by the opinions of Presidents\r\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, who have each repeatedly\r\nrecommended the exercise of this right under the Constitution, as by the\r\nuniform practice of Congress, the continued acquiescence of the States,\r\nand the general understanding of the people.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of a more expedient adjustment of the present tariff,\r\nalthough great, are far from being insurmountable. Some are unwilling to\r\nimprove any of its parts because they would destroy the whole; others\r\nfear to touch the objectionable parts lest those they approve should be\r\njeoparded. I am persuaded that the advocates of these conflicting views\r\ndo injustice to the American people and to their representatives. The\r\ngeneral interest is the interest of each, and my confidence is entire\r\nthat to insure the adoption of such modifications of the tariff as the\r\ngeneral interest requires it is only necessary that that interest should\r\nbe understood.\r\n\r\nIt is an infirmity of our nature to mingle our interests and prejudices\r\nwith the operation of our reasoning powers, and attribute to the objects\r\nof our likes and dislikes qualities they do not possess and effects they\r\ncan not produce. The effects of the present tariff are doubtless\r\noverrated, both in its evils and in its advantages. By one class of\r\nreasoners the reduced price of cotton and other agricultural products is\r\nascribed wholly to its influence, and by another the reduced price of\r\nmanufactured articles. The probability is that neither opinion\r\napproaches the truth, and that both are induced by that influence of\r\ninterests and prejudices to which I have referred. The decrease of\r\nprices extends throughout the commercial world, embracing not only the\r\nraw material and the manufactured article, but provisions and lands. The\r\ncause must therefore be deeper and more pervading than the tariff of the\r\nUnited States. It may in a measure be attributable to the increased\r\nvalue of the precious metals, produced by a diminution of the supply and\r\nan increase in the demand, while commerce has rapidly extended itself\r\nand population has augmented. The supply of gold and silver, the general\r\nmedium of exchange, has been greatly interrupted by civil convulsions in\r\nthe countries from which they are principally drawn. A part of the\r\neffect, too, is doubtless owing to an increase of operatives and\r\nimprovements in machinery. But on the whole it is questionable whether\r\nthe reduction in the price of lands, produce, and manufactures has been\r\ngreater than the appreciation of the standard of value.\r\n\r\nWhile the chief object of duties should be revenue, they may be so\r\nadjusted as to encourage manufactures. In this adjustment, however, it\r\nis the duty of the Government to be guided by the general good. Objects\r\nof national importance alone ought to be protected. Of these the\r\nproductions of our soil, our mines, and our workshops, essential to\r\nnational defense, occupy the first rank. Whatever other species of\r\ndomestic industry, having the importance to which I have referred, may\r\nbe expected, after temporary protection, to compete with foreign labor\r\non equal terms merit the same attention in a subordinate degree.\r\n\r\nThe present tariff taxes some of the comforts of life unnecessarily\r\nhigh; it undertakes to protect interests too local and minute to justify\r\na general exaction, and it also attempts to force some kinds of\r\nmanufactures for which the country is not ripe. Much relief will be\r\nderived in some of these respects from the measures of your last\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nThe best as well as fairest mode of determining whether from any just\r\nconsiderations a particular interest ought to receive protection would\r\nbe to submit the question singly for deliberation. If after due\r\nexamination of its merits, unconnected with extraneous considerations--\r\nsuch as a desire to sustain a general system or to purchase support for\r\na different interest--it should enlist in its favor a majority of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, there can be little danger of wrong or\r\ninjury in adjusting the tariff with reference to its protective effect.\r\nIf this obviously just principle were honestly adhered to, the branches\r\nof industry which deserve protection would be saved from the prejudice\r\nexcited against them when that protection forms part of a system by\r\nwhich portions of the country feel or conceive themselves to be\r\noppressed. What is incalculably more important, the vital principle of\r\nour system--that principle which requires acquiescence in the will of\r\nthe majority--would be secure from the discredit and danger to which it\r\nis exposed by the acts of majorities founded not on identity of\r\nconviction, but on combinations of small minorities entered into for the\r\npurpose of mutual assistance in measures which, resting solely on their\r\nown merits, could never be carried.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this is a subject of so much delicacy, on account\r\nof the extended interests it involves, as to require that it should be\r\ntouched with the utmost caution, and that while an abandonment of the\r\npolicy in which it originated--a policy coeval with our Government, and\r\npursued through successive Administrations--is neither to be expected or\r\ndesired, the people have a right to demand, and have demanded, that it\r\nbe so modified as to correct abuses and obviate injustice.\r\n\r\nThat our deliberations on this interesting subject should be\r\nuninfluenced by those partisan conflicts that are incident to free\r\ninstitutions is the fervent wish of my heart. To make this great\r\nquestion, which unhappily so much divides and excites the public mind,\r\nsubservient to the short sighted views of faction must destroy all hope\r\nof settling it satisfactorily to the great body of the people and for\r\nthe general interest. I can not, therefore, in taking leave of the\r\nsubject, too earnestly for my own feelings or the common good warn you\r\nagainst the blighting consequences of such a course.\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimates at the Treasury Department, the receipts in\r\nthe Treasury during the present year will amount to $24,161,018, which\r\nwill exceed by about $300,000 the estimate presented in the last annual\r\nreport of the Secretary of the Treasury. The total expenditure during\r\nthe year, exclusive of public debt, is estimated at $13,742,311, and the\r\npayment on account of public debt for the same period will have been\r\n$11,354,630, leaving a balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January,\r\n1831, of $4,819,781.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the condition of our finances, it affords me pleasure\r\nto remark that judicious and efficient arrangements have been made by\r\nthe Treasury Department for securing the pecuniary responsibility of the\r\npublic officers and the more punctual payment of the public dues. The\r\nRevenue-Cutter Service has been organized and placed on a good footing,\r\nand aided by an increase of inspectors at exposed points, and\r\nregulations adopted under the act of May, 1830, for the inspection and\r\nappraisement of merchandise, has produced much improvement in the\r\nexecution of the laws and more security against the commission of frauds\r\nupon the revenue. Abuses in the allowances for fishing bounties have\r\nalso been corrected, and a material saving in that branch of the service\r\nthereby effected. In addition to these improvements the system of\r\nexpenditure for sick seamen belonging to the merchant service has been\r\nrevised, and being rendered uniform and economical the benefits of the\r\nfund applicable to this object have been usefully extended.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of our country is also further evinced by the increased\r\nrevenue arising from the sale of public lands, as will appear from the\r\nreport of the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the documents\r\naccompanying it, which are herewith transmitted. I beg leave to draw\r\nyour attention to this report, and to the propriety of making early\r\nappropriations for the objects which it specifies.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again invited to the subjects connected with that\r\nportion of the public interests intrusted to the War Department. Some of\r\nthem were referred to in my former message, and they are presented in\r\ndetail in the report of the Secretary of War herewith submitted. I refer\r\nyou also to the report of that officer for a knowledge of the state of\r\nthe Army, fortifications, arsenals, and Indian affairs, all of which it\r\nwill be perceived have been guarded with zealous attention and care. It\r\nis worthy of your consideration whether the armaments necessary for the\r\nfortifications on our maritime frontier which are now or shortly will be\r\ncompleted should not be in readiness sooner than the customary\r\nappropriations will enable the Department to provide them. This\r\nprecaution seems to be due to the general system of fortification which\r\nhas been sanctioned by Congress, and is recommended by that maxim of\r\nwisdom which tells us in peace to prepare for war.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy for a highly\r\nsatisfactory account of the manner in which the concerns of that\r\nDepartment have been conducted during the present year. Our position in\r\nrelation to the most powerful nations of the earth, and the present\r\ncondition of Europe, admonish us to cherish this arm of our national\r\ndefense with peculiar care. Separated by wide seas from all those\r\nGovernments whose power we might have reason to dread, we have nothing\r\nto apprehend from attempts at conquest. It is chiefly attacks upon our\r\ncommerce and harassing inroads upon our coast against which we have to\r\nguard. A naval force adequate to the protection of our commerce, always\r\nafloat, with an accumulation of the means to give it a rapid extension\r\nin case of need, furnishes the power by which all such aggressions may\r\nbe prevented or repelled. The attention of the Government has therefore\r\nbeen recently directed more to preserving the public vessels already\r\nbuilt and providing materials to be placed in depot for future use than\r\nto increasing their number. With the aid of Congress, in a few years the\r\nGovernment will be prepared in case of emergency to put afloat a\r\npowerful navy of new ships almost as soon as old ones could be repaired.\r\n\r\nThe modifications in this part of the service suggested in my last\r\nannual message, which are noticed more in detail in the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, are again recommended to your serious attention.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General in like manner exhibits a\r\nsatisfactory view of the important branch of the Government under his\r\ncharge. In addition to the benefits already secured by the operations of\r\nthe Post-Office Department, considerable improvements within the present\r\nyear have been made by an increase in the accommodation afforded by\r\nstage coaches, and in the frequency and celerity of the mail between\r\nsome of the most important points of the Union.\r\n\r\nUnder the late contracts improvements have been provided for the\r\nsouthern section of the country, and at the same time an annual saving\r\nmade of upward of $72,000. Notwithstanding the excess of expenditure\r\nbeyond the current receipts for a few years past, necessarily incurred\r\nin the fulfillment of existing contracts and in the additional expenses\r\nbetween the periods of contracting to meet the demands created by the\r\nrapid growth and extension of our nourishing country, yet the\r\nsatisfactory assurance is given that the future revenue of the\r\nDepartment will be sufficient to meet its extensive engagements. The\r\nsystem recently introduced that subjects its receipts and disbursements\r\nto strict regulation has entirely fulfilled its designs. It gives full\r\nassurance of the punctual transmission, as well as the security of the\r\nfunds of the Department. The efficiency and industry of its officers and\r\nthe ability and energy of contractors justify an increased confidence in\r\nits continued prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress was called on a former occasion to the\r\nnecessity of such a modification in the office of Attorney-General of\r\nthe United States as would render it more adequate to the wants of the\r\npublic service. This resulted in the establishment of the office of\r\nSolicitor of the Treasury, and the earliest measures were taken to give\r\neffect to the provisions of the law which authorized the appointment of\r\nthat officer and defined his duties. But it is not believed that this\r\nprovision, however useful in itself, is calculated to supersede the\r\nnecessity of extending the duties and powers of the Attorney-General's\r\nOffice. On the contrary, I am convinced that the public interest would\r\nbe greatly promoted by giving to that officer the general\r\nsuperintendence of the various law agents of the Government, and of all\r\nlaw proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which the United States\r\nmay be interested, allowing him at the same time such a compensation as\r\nwould enable him to devote his undivided attention to the public\r\nbusiness. I think such a provision is alike due to the public and to the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nOccasions of reference from the different Executive Departments to the\r\nAttorney-General are of frequent occurrence, and the prompt decision of\r\nthe questions so referred tends much to facilitate the dispatch of\r\nbusiness in those Departments. The report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury hereto appended shows also a branch of the public service not\r\nspecifically intrusted to any officer which might be advantageously\r\ncommitted to the Attorney-General. But independently of those\r\nconsiderations this office is now one of daily duty. It was originally\r\norganized and its compensation fixed with a view to occasional service,\r\nleaving to the incumbent time for the exercise of his profession in\r\nprivate practice. The state of things which warranted such an\r\norganization no longer exists. The frequent claims upon the services of\r\nthis officer would render his absence from the seat of Government in\r\nprofessional attendance upon the courts injurious to the public service,\r\nand the interests of the Government could not fail to be promoted by\r\ncharging him with the general superintendence of all its legal concerns.\r\n\r\nUnder a strong conviction of the justness of these suggestions, I\r\nrecommend it to Congress to make the necessary provisions for giving\r\neffect to them, and to place the Attorney-General in regard to\r\ncompensation on the same footing with the heads of the several Executive\r\nDepartments. To this officer might also be intrusted a cognizance of the\r\ncases of insolvency in public debtors, especially if the views which I\r\nsubmitted on this subject last year should meet the approbation of\r\nCongress--to which I again solicit your attention.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the situation of the District\r\nof Columbia. Placed by the Constitution under the exclusive jurisdiction\r\nand control of Congress, this District is certainly entitled to a much\r\ngreater share of its consideration than it has yet received. There is a\r\nwant of uniformity in its laws, particularly in those of a penal\r\ncharacter, which increases the expense of their administration and\r\nsubjects the people to all the inconveniences which result from the\r\noperation of different codes in so small a territory. On different sides\r\nof the Potomac the same offense is punishable in unequal degrees, and\r\nthe peculiarities of many of the early laws of Maryland and Virginia\r\nremain in force, notwithstanding their repugnance in some cases to the\r\nimprovements which have superseded them in those States.\r\n\r\nBesides a remedy for these evils, which is loudly called for, it is\r\nrespectfully submitted whether a provision authorizing the election of a\r\ndelegate to represent the wants of the citizens of this District on the\r\nfloor of Congress is not due to them and to the character of our\r\nGovernment. No portion of our citizens should be without a practical\r\nenjoyment of the principles of freedom, and there is none more important\r\nthan that which cultivates a proper relation between the governors and\r\nthe governed. Imperfect as this must be in this case, yet it is believed\r\nthat it would be greatly improved by a representation in Congress with\r\nthe same privileges that are allowed to the other Territories of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe penitentiary is ready for the reception of convicts, and only awaits\r\nthe necessary legislation to put it into operation, as one object of\r\nwhich I beg leave to recall your attention to the propriety of providing\r\nsuitable compensation for the officers charged with its inspection.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the principles involved in the inquiry whether it will\r\nbe proper to recharter the Bank of the United States requires that I\r\nshould again call the attention of Congress to the subject. Nothing has\r\noccurred to lessen in any degree the dangers which many of our citizens\r\napprehend from that institution as at present organized. In the spirit\r\nof improvement and compromise which distinguishes our country and its\r\ninstitutions it becomes us to inquire whether it be not possible to\r\nsecure the advantages afforded by the present bank through the agency of\r\na Bank of the United States so modified in its principles and structure\r\nas to obviate constitutional and other objections.\r\n\r\nIt is thought practicable to organize such a bank with the necessary\r\nofficers as a branch of the Treasury Department, based on the public and\r\nindividual deposits, without power to make loans or purchase property,\r\nwhich shall remit the funds of the Government, and the expense of which\r\nmay be paid, if thought advisable, by allowing its officers to sell\r\nbills of exchange to private individuals at a moderate premium. Not\r\nbeing a corporate body, having no stockholders, debtors, or property,\r\nand but few officers, it would not be obnoxious to the constitutional\r\nobjections which are urged against the present bank; and having no means\r\nto operate on the hopes, fears, or interests of large masses of the\r\ncommunity, it would be shorn of the influence which makes that bank\r\nformidable. The States would be strengthened by having in their hands\r\nthe means of furnishing the local paper currency through their own\r\nbanks, while the Bank of the United States, though issuing no paper,\r\nwould check the issues of the State banks by taking their notes in\r\ndeposit and for exchange only so long as they continue to be redeemed\r\nwith specie. In times of public emergency the capacities of such an\r\ninstitution might be enlarged by legislative provisions.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are made not so much as a recommendation as with a\r\nview of calling the attention of Congress to the possible modifications\r\nof a system which can not continue to exist in its present form without\r\noccasional collisions with the local authorities and perpetual\r\napprehensions and discontent on the part of the States and the people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, fellow-citizens, allow me to invoke in behalf of your\r\ndeliberations that spirit of conciliation and disinterestedness which is\r\nthe gift of patriotism. Under an overruling and merciful Providence the\r\nagency of this spirit has thus far been signalized in the prosperity and\r\nglory of our beloved country. May its influence be eternal.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 9, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: I transmit herewith a treaty concluded by commissioners duly\r\nauthorized on the part of the United States with the Choctaw tribe of\r\nIndians, which, with explanatory documents, is submitted to the Senate\r\nfor their advice and consent as to the ratification of the same.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _December 10, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate printed copies of the convention between the\r\nUnited States and His Majesty the King of Denmark, concluded at\r\nCopenhagen on the 28th March, 1830, and ratified by and with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n(The same message was sent to the House of Representatives.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _December 10, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI submit for the consideration of the Senate a treaty of commerce and\r\nnavigation, together with a separate and secret article, concluded at\r\nConstantinople on the 7th day of May last, and signed by Charles Rhind,\r\nJames Biddle, and David Offley as commissioners on the part of the\r\nUnited States, and by Mahommed Hamed, reis effendi, on the part of the\r\nSublime Porte.\r\n\r\nThe French versions herewith transmitted, and accompanied by copies and\r\nEnglish translations of the same, are transcripts of the original\r\ntranslations from the Turkish, signed by the commissioners of the United\r\nStates and delivered to the Government of the Sublime Porte.\r\n\r\nThe paper in Turkish is the original signed by the Turkish\r\nplenipotentiary and delivered by him to the American commissioners. Of\r\nthis a translation into the English language, and believed to be\r\ncorrect, is like-wise transmitted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _December 15, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives._\r\n\r\nGentlemen: From information received at the Department of State it is\r\nascertained that owing to unforeseen circumstances several of the\r\nmarshals have been unable to complete the enumeration of the inhabitants\r\nof the United States within the time prescribed by the act of the 23d\r\nMarch, 1830, viz, by the 1st day of the present month.\r\n\r\nAs the completion of the Fifth Census as respects several of the States\r\nof the Union will have been defeated unless Congress, to whom the case\r\nis submitted, shall by an act of the present session allow further time\r\nfor making the returns in question, the expediency is suggested of\r\nallowing such an act to pass at as early a day as possible.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 20, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 14th instant,\r\ncalling for copies of any letters or other communications which may have\r\nbeen received at the Department of War from the chiefs and headmen, or\r\nany of them, of the Choctaw tribe of Indians since the treaty entered\r\ninto by the commissioners on the part of the United States with that\r\ntribe of Indians at Dancing Rabbit Creek, and also for information\r\nshowing the number of Indians belonging to that tribe who have emigrated\r\nto the country west of the Mississippi, etc., I submit herewith a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of War, containing the information requested.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _December 20, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 16th instant,\r\ncalling for certain papers relative to the negotiation of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Turkey now before the Senate, I\r\ncommunicate the inclosed report of the Secretary of State, accompanied\r\nby the documents and containing the information requested.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 29, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of the Senate two treaties--one of peace,\r\nthe other of cession--concluded at Prairie du Chien on the 10th and 15th\r\nJuly, 1830, by commissioners duly authorized on the part of the United\r\nStates and by deputations of the confederated tribes of Indians residing\r\non the Upper Mississippi.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 30, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States:_\r\n\r\nA vacancy having arisen in the office of brigadier in consequence of the\r\nremoval of General John Nicks from the Territory of Arkansas to\r\nCantonment Gibson, I nominated at your last session William Montgomery\r\nto be general of the second brigade of militia of said Territory. By\r\nthis communication I desire to correct the Journal of the Senate and my\r\nmessage of the 22d of April, 1830, so as to exclude the idea that\r\nGeneral Nicks was removed from office.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _December 31, 1830_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to Congress a copy of a correspondence which lately\r\npassed between Major-General Von Scholten, His Danish Majesty's\r\ngovernor-general of his West India possessions and special minister to\r\nthe United States, and Mr. Van Buren, Secretary of State, concerning the\r\nregulation of the commercial intercourse between those possessions and\r\nthe United States, which comprehends the propositions that General Von\r\nScholten made to this Government in behalf of his Sovereign upon that\r\nsubject and the answers of the Secretary of State to the same, the last\r\nshowing the grounds upon which this Government declined acceding to the\r\novertures of the Danish envoy.\r\n\r\nThis correspondence is now submitted to the two Houses of Congress in\r\ncompliance with the wish and request of General Von Scholten himself,\r\nand under the full persuasion upon my part that it will receive all the\r\nattention and consideration to which the very friendly relations that\r\nhave so long subsisted between the United States and the King of Denmark\r\nespecially entitle it in the councils of this Union.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 3, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSince my message of the 20th of December last, transmitting to the\r\nSenate a report from the Secretary of War, with information requested by\r\nthe resolution of the Senate of the 14th December, in relation to the\r\ntreaty concluded at Dancing Rabbit Creek with the Choctaw Indians, I\r\nhave received the two letters which are herewith inclosed, containing\r\nfurther information on the subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _January 3, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress the papers relating to the recent arrangement\r\nwith Great Britain with respect to the trade between her colonial\r\npossessions and the United States, to which reference was made in my\r\nmessage at the opening of the present session.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from those documents that owing to the omission in the\r\nact of the 29th of May last of a clause expressly restricting\r\nimportations into the British colonies in American vessels to the\r\nproductions of the United States, to the amendment engrafted upon that\r\nact in the House Of Representatives, providing that when the trade with\r\nthe West India colonies should be opened the commercial intercourse of\r\nthe United States with all other parts of the British dominions or\r\npossessions should be left on a footing not less favorable to the United\r\nStates than it now is, and to the act not specifying the terms upon\r\nwhich British vessels coming from the northern colonies should be\r\nadmitted to entry into the ports of the United States, an apprehension\r\nwas entertained by the Government of Great Britain that under the\r\ncontemplated arrangement claims might be set up on our part inconsistent\r\nwith the propositions submitted by our minister and with the terms to\r\nwhich she was willing to agree, and that this circumstance led to\r\nexplanations between Mr. McLane and the Earl of Aberdeen respecting the\r\nintentions of Congress and the true construction to be given to the act\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nTo the interpretation given by them to that act I did not hesitate to\r\nagree. It was quite clear that in adopting the amendment referred to\r\nCongress could not have intended to preclude future alterations in the\r\nexisting intercourse between the United States and other parts of the\r\nBritish dominions; and the supposition that the omission to restrict in\r\nterms the importations to the productions of the country to which the\r\nvessels respectively belong was intentional was precluded by the\r\npropositions previously made by this Government to that of Great\r\nBritain, and which were before Congress at the time of the passage of\r\nthe act; by the principles which govern the maritime legislation of the\r\ntwo countries and by the provisions of the existing commercial treaty\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nActuated by this view of the subject, and convinced that it was in\r\naccordance with the real intentions of Congress, I felt it my duty to\r\ngive effect to the arrangement by issuing the required proclamation, of\r\nwhich a copy is likewise herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 5, 1831_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n17th of December last, calling for information on the subject of\r\ninternal improvement, I submit herewith a report from the Secretaries of\r\nWar and Treasury, containing the information required.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 7, 1831_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the accompanying report\r\nfrom the Navy Department, upon the state of the accounts of the Navy in\r\nthe office of the Fourth Auditor, and to suggest the necessity of\r\ncorrecting the evils complained of by early legislation.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _January 11, 1831_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report of the Secretary of State, with the\r\nreport to him from the Patent Office which accompanied it, in relation\r\nto the concerns of that office, and recommend the whole subject to early\r\nand favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n(The same message was sent to the Senate.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 15, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 23d ultimo,\r\nrequesting to be informed of the quantity of live-oak timber in the\r\nUnited States, where it is, and what means are employed to preserve it,\r\nI present herewith a report of the Secretary of the Navy, containing the\r\ninformation required,\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 15, 1831_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of Congress the accompanying report and\r\ndocuments from the Navy Department, in relation to the capture of the\r\nSpanish slave vessel called _The Fenix_, and recommend that suitable\r\nlegislative provision be made for the maintenance of the unfortunate\r\ncaptives pending the legislation which has grown out of the case.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 24, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, containing the\r\ninformation requested by the resolution of the Senate of the 21st\r\ninstant, in relation to \"the state of the British establishments in the\r\nvalley of the Columbia and the state of the fur trade as carried on by\r\nthe citizens of the United States and the Hudsons Bay Company.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 25, 1831_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the inclosed\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of the Navy, in relation to the pay and\r\nother allowances of the officers of the Marine Corps, and to recommend\r\nthe adoption of the legislative provisions suggested in it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, D.C., _January 26, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the advice and consent of the Senate as expressed in\r\ntheir resolution of the 10th February, 1830, the treaty of commerce and\r\nnavigation between the United States and Austria concluded in this city\r\non the 27th of August, 1829, was duly ratified by this Government on the\r\n11th day of the same month of February; but the treaty itself containing\r\na stipulation that the ratifications of the two parties to it should be\r\nexchanged within twelve months from the date of its signature, and that\r\nof the Austrian Government not having been received here till after the\r\nexpiration of the time limited, I have not thought myself at liberty\r\nunder these circumstances, without the additional advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate, to authorize that ceremony on the part of this Government.\r\nInformation having been received at the Department of State from the\r\nAustrian representative in the United States that he is prepared to\r\nproceed to the exchange of the ratifications of his Government for that\r\nof this, the question is therefore submitted to the Senate for their\r\nadvice and consent upon the occasion.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 3, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI respectfully submit to the Senate, in answer to their legislative\r\nresolution of the 20th ultimo, in relation to the sales of land at the\r\nCrawfordsville land office in November last, reports from the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and the Commissioner of the General Land Office.\r\n\r\nConcurring with the Secretary of the Treasury in the views he has taken\r\nof the treaties and act of Congress touching the subject, I can not\r\ndiscover that the President is invested with any power under the\r\nConstitution or laws to withhold a patent from a purchaser who has given\r\na fair and valuable consideration for land, and thereby acquired a\r\nvested right to the same; nor do I perceive that the sole legislative\r\nresolution of the Senate can confer such a power, or suspend the right\r\nof the citizens to enter the lands that have been offered for sale in\r\nsaid district and remain unsold, so long as the law authorizing the same\r\nremains unrepealed.\r\n\r\nI beg leave, therefore, to present the subject to the reconsideration of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _February 3, 1831_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Treasury\r\nDepartment, in compliance with the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 3d ultimo, calling for the correspondence in\r\nrelation to locating a cession of lands made or intended to be made by\r\nthe Pottawattamie tribe of Indians for the benefit of the State of\r\nIndiana, etc.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the House of Representatives, in compliance with their\r\nresolution of the 29th of January last, calling for information and\r\npapers respecting the seizure of American vessels by the naval forces of\r\nPortugal forming the blockade of the island of Terceira, a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, which, with the documents accompanying it,\r\ncontains the information in his Department upon that subject, and avail\r\nmyself of the occasion further to inform the House of Representatives\r\nthat orders had before the introduction of the resolution referred to\r\nbeen given to fit out a ship of war for the more effectual protection of\r\nour commerce in that quarter.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_February 16, 1831_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _February 19, 1831._\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI present for the consideration of Congress a report from the Secretary\r\nof War, relative to a compromise of title of the island on which Fort\r\nDelaware has been constructed.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n(The same message was sent to the Senate.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 22, 1831_.\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a letter from Mr. Rhind, stating the\r\ncircumstances under which he received the four Arabian horses that were\r\nbrought by him to the United States from Turkey. His letter will enable\r\nCongress to decide what ought to be done with them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 22, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received your resolution of the 15th instant, requesting me \"to\r\ninform the Senate whether the provisions of the act entitled 'An act to\r\nregulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve\r\npeace on the frontiers,' passed the 30th of March, 1802, have been fully\r\ncomplied with on the part of the United States Government, and if they\r\nhave not that he inform the Senate of the reasons that have induced the\r\nGovernment to decline the enforcement of said act,\" and I now reply to\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nAccording to my views of the act referred to, I am not aware of any\r\nomission to carry into effect its provisions in relation to trade and\r\nintercourse with the Indian tribes so far as their execution depended on\r\nthe agency confided to the Executive.\r\n\r\nThe numerous provisions of that act designed to secure to the Indians\r\nthe peaceable possession of their lands may be reduced, substantially,\r\nto the following: That citizens of the United States are restrained\r\nunder sufficient penalties from entering upon the lands for the purpose\r\nof hunting thereon, or of settling them, or of giving their horses and\r\ncattle the benefit of a range upon them, or of traveling through them\r\nwithout a written permission; and that the President of the United\r\nStates is authorized to employ the military force of the country to\r\nsecure the observance of these provisions. The authority to the\r\nPresident, however, is not imperative. The language is:\r\n\r\n    It shall be lawful for the President to take such measures and to\r\n    employ such military force as he may judge necessary to remove from\r\n    lands belonging to or secured by treaty to any Indian tribe any\r\n    citizen who shall make a settlement thereon.\r\n\r\nBy the nineteenth section of this act it is provided that nothing in it\r\n\"shall be construed to prevent any trade or intercourse with Indians\r\nliving on lands surrounded by settlements of citizens of the United\r\nStates and being within the ordinary jurisdiction of any of the\r\nindividual States.\" This provision I have interpreted as being\r\nprospective in its operation and as applicable not only to Indian tribes\r\nwhich at the date of its passage were subject to the jurisdiction of any\r\nState, but to such also as should thereafter become so. To this\r\nconstruction of its meaning I have endeavored to conform, and have taken\r\nno step inconsistent with it. As soon, therefore, as the sovereign power\r\nof the State of Georgia was exercised by an extension of her laws\r\nthroughout her limits, and I had received information of the same,\r\norders were given to withdraw from the State the troops which had been\r\ndetailed to prevent intrusion upon the Indian lands within it, and these\r\norders were executed. The reasons which dictated them shall be frankly\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nThe principle recognized in the section last quoted was not for the\r\nfirst time then avowed. It is conformable to the uniform practice of the\r\nGovernment before the adoption of the Constitution, and amounts to a\r\ndistinct recognition by Congress at that early day of the doctrine that\r\nthat instrument had not varied the powers of the Federal Government over\r\nIndian affairs from what they were under the Articles of Confederation.\r\nIt is not believed that there is a single instance in the legislation of\r\nthe country in which the Indians have been regarded as possessing\r\npolitical rights independent of the control and authority of the States\r\nwithin the limits of which they resided. As early as the year 1782 the\r\nJournals of Congress will show that no claim of such a character was\r\ncountenanced by that body. In that year the application of a tribe of\r\nIndians residing in South Carolina to have certain tracts of land which\r\nhad been reserved for their use in that State secured to them free from\r\nintrusion, and without the right of alienating them even with their own\r\nconsent, was brought to the consideration of Congress by a report from\r\nthe Secretary of War. The resolution which was adopted on that occasion\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Resolved_, That it be recommended to the legislature of South\r\n    Carolina to take such measures for the satisfaction and security of\r\n    said tribes as the said legislature in their wisdom may think fit.\r\n\r\nHere is no assertion of the right of Congress under the Articles of\r\nConfederation to interfere with the jurisdiction of the States over\r\nIndians within their limits, but rather a negation of it. They refused\r\nto interfere with the subject, and referred it under a general\r\nrecommendation back to the State, to be disposed of as her wisdom might\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\nIf in addition to this act and the language of the Articles of\r\nConfederation anything further can be wanting to show the early views of\r\nthe Government on the subject, it will be found in the proclamation\r\nissued by Congress in 1783. It contains this language:\r\n\r\n    The United States in Congress assembled have thought proper to issue\r\n    their proclamation, and they do hereby prohibit and forbid all\r\n    persons from making settlements on lands inhabited or claimed by\r\n    Indians without the limits or jurisdiction of any particular State.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    _Resolved_, That the preceding measures of Congress relative to\r\n    Indian affairs shall not be construed to affect the territorial\r\n    claims of any of the States or their legislative rights within their\r\n    respective limits.\r\n\r\nIt was not then pretended that the General Government had the power in\r\ntheir relations with the Indians to control or oppose the internal\r\npolity of the individual States of this Union, and if such was the case\r\nunder the Articles of Confederation the only question on the subject\r\nsince must arise out of some more enlarged power or authority given to\r\nthe General Government by the present Constitution. Does any such exist?\r\n\r\nAmongst the enumerated grants of the Constitution that which relates to\r\nthis subject is expressed in these words: \"Congress shall have power to\r\nregulate commerce with the Indian tribes.\" In the interpretation of this\r\npower we ought certainly to be guided by what had been the practice of\r\nthe Government and the meaning which had been generally attached to the\r\nresolves of the old Congress if the words used to convey it do not\r\nclearly import a different one, as far as it affects the question of\r\njurisdiction in the individual States. The States ought not to be\r\ndivested of any part of their antecedent jurisdiction by implication or\r\ndoubtful construction. Tested by this rule it seems to me to be\r\nunquestionable that the jurisdiction of the States is left untouched by\r\nthis clause of the Constitution, and that it was designed to give to the\r\nGeneral Government complete control over the trade and intercourse of\r\nthose Indians only who were not within the limits of any State.\r\n\r\nFrom a view of the acts referred to and the uniform practice of the\r\nGovernment it is manifest that until recently it has never been\r\nmaintained that the right of jurisdiction by a State over Indians within\r\nits territory was subordinate to the power of the Federal Government.\r\nThat doctrine has not been enforced nor even asserted in any of the\r\nStates of New England where tribes of Indians have resided, and where a\r\nfew of them yet remain. These tribes have been left to the undisturbed\r\ncontrol of the States in which they were found, in conformity with the\r\nview which has been taken of the opinions prevailing up to 1789 and the\r\nclear interpretation of the act of 1802. In the State of New York, where\r\nseveral tribes have resided, it has been the policy of the Government to\r\navoid entering into quasi treaty engagements with them, barely\r\nappointing commissioners occasionally on the part of the United States\r\nto facilitate the objects of the State in its negotiations with them.\r\nThe Southern States present an exception to this policy. As early as\r\n1784 the settlements within the limits of North Carolina were advanced\r\nfarther to the west than the authority of the State to enforce an\r\nobedience of its laws. Others were in a similar condition. The\r\nnecessities, therefore, and not the acknowledged principles, of the\r\nGovernment must have suggested the policy of treating with the Indians\r\nin that quarter as the only practicable mode of conciliating their good\r\nwill. The United States at that period had just emerged from a\r\nprotracted war for the achievement of their independence. At the moment\r\nof its conclusion many of these tribes, as powerful as they were\r\nferocious in their mode of warfare, remained in arms, desolating our\r\nfrontier settlements. Under these circumstances the first treaties, in\r\n1785 and 1790, with the Cherokees, were concluded by the Government of\r\nthe United States, and were evidently sanctioned as measures of\r\nnecessity adapted to the character of the Indians and indispensable to\r\nthe peace and security of the western frontier. But they can not be\r\nunderstood as changing the political relations of the Indians to the\r\nStates or to the Federal Government. To effect this would have required\r\nthe operation of quite a different principle and the intervention of a\r\ntribunal higher than that of the treaty-making power.\r\n\r\nTo infer from the assent of the Government to this deviation from the\r\npractice which had before governed its intercourse with the Indians, and\r\nthe accidental forbearance of the States to assert their right of\r\njurisdiction over them, that they had surrendered this portion of their\r\nsovereignty, and that its assumption now is usurpation, is conceding too\r\nmuch to the necessity which dictated those treaties, and doing violence\r\nto the principles of the Government and the rights of the States without\r\nbenefiting in the least degree the Indians. The Indians thus situated\r\ncan not be regarded in any other light than as members of a foreign\r\ngovernment or of that of the State within whose chartered limits they\r\nreside. If in the former, the ordinary legislation of Congress in\r\nrelation to them is not warranted by the Constitution, which was\r\nestablished for the benefit of our own, not of a foreign people. If in\r\nthe latter, then, like other citizens or people resident within the\r\nlimits of the States, they are subject to their jurisdiction and\r\ncontrol. To maintain a contrary doctrine and to require the Executive to\r\nenforce it by the employment of a military force would be to place in\r\nhis hands a power to make war upon the rights of the States and the\r\nliberties of the country--a power which should be placed in the hands of\r\nno individual.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, the Indians are to be regarded as people possessing rights\r\nwhich they can exercise independently of the States, much error has\r\narisen in the intercourse of the Government with them. Why is it that\r\nthey have been called upon to assist in our wars without the privilege\r\nof exercising their own discretion? If an independent people, they\r\nshould as such be consulted and advised with; but they have not been. In\r\nan order which was issued to me from the War Department in September,\r\n1814, this language is employed:\r\n\r\n    All the friendly Indians should be organized and prepared to\r\n    cooperate with your other forces. There appears to be some\r\n    dissatisfaction among the Choctaws; their friendship and services\r\n    should be secured without delay. The friendly Indians must be fed\r\n    and paid, and _made to fight when_ and _where their services may be\r\n    required_.\r\n\r\nTo an independent and foreign people this would seem to be assuming, I\r\nshould suppose, rather too lofty a tone--one which the Government would\r\nnot have assumed if they had considered them in that light. Again, by\r\nthe Constitution the power of declaring war belongs exclusively to\r\nCongress. We have been often engaged in war with the Indian tribes\r\nwithin our limits, but when have these hostilities been preceded or\r\naccompanied by an act of Congress declaring war against the tribe which\r\nwas the object of them? And was the prosecution of such hostilities an\r\nusurpation in each case by the Executive which conducted them of the\r\nconstitutional power of Congress? It must have been so, I apprehend, if\r\nthese tribes are to be considered as foreign and independent nations.\r\n\r\nThe steps taken to prevent intrusion upon Indian lands had their origin\r\nwith the commencement of our Government, and became the subject of\r\nspecial legislation in 1802, with the reservations which have been\r\nmentioned in favor of the jurisdiction of the States. With the exception\r\nof South Carolina, who has uniformly regulated the Indians within her\r\nlimits without the aid of the General Government, they have been felt\r\nwithin all the States of the South without being understood to affect\r\ntheir rights or prevent the exercise of their jurisdiction, whenever\r\nthey were in a situation to assume and enforce it. Georgia, though\r\nmaterially concerned, has on this principle forborne to spread her\r\nlegislation farther than the settlements of her own white citizens,\r\nuntil she has recently perceived within her limits a people claiming to\r\nbe capable of self-government, sitting in legislative council,\r\norganizing courts and administering justice. To disarm such an anomalous\r\ninvasion of her sovereignty she has declared her determination to\r\nexecute her own laws throughout her limits--a step which seems to have\r\nbeen anticipated by the proclamation of 1783, and which is perfectly\r\nconsistent with the nineteenth section of the act of 1802. According to\r\nthe language and reasoning of that section, the tribes to the South and\r\nthe Southwest are not only \"surrounded by settlements of the citizens of\r\nthe United States,\" but are now also \"within the ordinary jurisdiction\r\nof the individual States.\" They became so from the moment the laws of\r\nthe State were extended over them, and the same result follows the\r\nsimilar determination of Alabama and Mississippi. These States have each\r\na right to claim in behalf of their position now on this question the\r\nsame respect which is conceded to the other States of the Union.\r\n\r\nToward this race of people I entertain the kindest feelings, and am not\r\nsensible that the views which I have taken of their true interests are\r\nless favorable to them than those which oppose their emigration to the\r\nWest. Years since I stated to them my belief that if the States chose to\r\nextend their laws over them it would not be in the power of the Federal\r\nGovernment to prevent it. My opinion remains the same, and I can see no\r\nalternative for them but that of their removal to the West or a quiet\r\nsubmission to the State laws. If they prefer to remove, the United\r\nStates agree to defray their expenses, to supply them the means of\r\ntransportation and a year's support after they reach their new homes--a\r\nprovision too liberal and kind to deserve the stamp of injustice. Either\r\ncourse promises them peace and happiness, whilst an obstinate\r\nperseverance in the effort to maintain their possessions independent of\r\nthe State authority can not fail to render their condition still more\r\nhelpless and miserable. Such an effort ought, therefore, to be\r\ndiscountenanced by all who sincerely sympathize in the fortunes of this\r\npeculiar people, and especially by the political bodies of the Union, as\r\ncalculated to disturb the harmony of the two Governments and to endanger\r\nthe safety of the many blessings which they enable us to enjoy.\r\n\r\nAs connected with the subject of this inquiry, I beg leave to refer to\r\nthe accompanying letter from the Secretary of War, inclosing the orders\r\nwhich proceeded from that Department, and a letter from the governor of\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _February 26, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe inclosed report[11] of the Secretary of War is herewith inclosed in\r\nanswer to the resolution of the Senate of yesterday's date.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Relative to the expenditure of appropriations for\r\nimproving the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI present for the consideration of the Senate articles of agreement\r\nentered into and concluded by commissioners duly appointed on the part\r\nof the United States and the chiefs of the Menominee tribe of Indians at\r\nGreen Bay. Various attempts were made to reconcile the conflicting\r\ninterests of the New York Indians, but without success, as will appear\r\nby the report made by the Secretary of War. No stipulation in their\r\nfavor could be introduced into the agreement without the consent of the\r\nMenominees, and that consent could not be obtained to any greater extent\r\nthan the articles show.\r\n\r\nCongress only is competent now to adjust and arrange these differences\r\nand satisfy the demands of the New York Indians. The whole matter is\r\nrespectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_February 28, 1831_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of the Senate of the United States\r\narticles of agreement and convention concluded this day between the\r\nUnited States, by a commissioner duly authorized, and the Seneca tribe\r\nof Indians resident in the State of Ohio.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_February 28, 1831_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 28, 1831_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the House of Representatives a treaty recently concluded\r\nwith the Choctaw tribe of Indians, that provision may be made for\r\ncarrying the same into effect agreeably to the estimate heretofore\r\npresented by the Secretary of War to the Committee of Ways and Means. It\r\nis a printed copy as it passed the Senate, no amendment having been made\r\nexcept to strike out the preamble. I also communicate a letter from the\r\nSecretary of War on this subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the use of the Senate, printed copies of the\r\ntreaties which have been lately ratified between the United States and\r\nthe Choctaw Indians and between the United States and the confederated\r\ntribes of the Sacs and Foxes and other tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n(The same message was sent to the House of Representatives.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a treaty of commerce and navigation between\r\nthe United States and the Emperor of Austria, concluded in this city on\r\nthe 28th March, 1830, the ratifications of which were exchanged on the\r\n10th of February last.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 2, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nJohn H. Clack, a master commandant in the Navy of the United States,\r\nhaving rank as such from the 24th April, 1828, was on the sentence of a\r\ncourt-martial, which was approved by me, ordered to be dismissed from\r\nthe service. On a reexamination of the record of the trial I am\r\nsatisfied that the proceeding was illegal in substance, and therefore\r\nthat the sentence was void.\r\n\r\nTo restore the party to the rights of which he was deprived by the\r\nenforcement of a sentence which was in law erroneous and void, I\r\nnominate the said John H. Clack to be a master commandant in the Navy of\r\nthe United States, to take rank as such from the 24th April, 1828.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been transmitted to the President of the United\r\nStates by the governor of the Territory of Arkansas that certain persons\r\npretending to act under the authority of the Mexican Government, and\r\nwithout any lawful right or power derived from that of the United\r\nStates, have attempted to and do survey, for sale and settlement, a\r\nportion of the public lands in said Territory, and particularly in the\r\ncounties of Lafayette, Sevier, and Miller, and have presumed to and do\r\nadminister to the citizens residing in said counties the oath of\r\nallegiance to the said Mexican Government; and\r\n\r\nWhereas such acts and practices are contrary to the law of the land and\r\nthe provisions of the act of Congress approved the 3d day of March, A.D.\r\n1807, and are offenses against the peace and public tranquillity of the\r\nsaid Territory and the inhabitants thereof:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Jackson, President of the\r\nUnited States, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me in and\r\nby the said act of Congress, do issue this my proclamation, commanding\r\nand strictly enjoining all persons who have unlawfully entered upon,\r\ntaken possession of, or made any settlement on the public lands in the\r\nsaid counties of Lafayette, Sevier, or Miller, or who may be in the\r\nunlawful occupation or possession of the same, or any part thereof,\r\nforthwith to depart and remove therefrom; and I do hereby command and\r\nrequire the marshal of the said Territory of Arkansas, or other officer\r\nor officers acting as such marshal, from and after the 15th day of April\r\nnext to remove or cause to be removed all persons who may then\r\nunlawfully be upon, in possession of, or who may unlawfully occupy any\r\nof the public lands in the said counties of Lafayette, Sevier, or\r\nMiller, or who may be surveying or attempting to survey the same without\r\nany authority therefor from the Government of the United States; and to\r\nexecute and carry into effect this proclamation I do hereby authorize\r\nthe employment of such military force as may be necessary pursuant to\r\nthe act of Congress aforesaid, and warn all offenders in the premises\r\nthat they will be prosecuted and punished in such other way and manner\r\nas may be consistent with the provisions and requisitions of the law in\r\nsuch case made and provided.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this 10th day of February, A.D. 1831,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States of America the fifty-fifth.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\nBy the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDER.\r\n\r\nWashington, _August 6, 1831_.\r\n_Acting Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSir: You will, after the receipt of this, report to the President for\r\ndismissal every clerk in your office who shall avail himself of the\r\nbenefit of the insolvent debtors' act for debts contracted during my\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n(The same order was addressed to the Secretary of the Navy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n_December 6, 1831_.\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe representation of the people has been renewed for the twenty-second\r\ntime since the Constitution they formed has been in force. For near half\r\na century the Chief Magistrates who have been successively chosen have\r\nmade their annual communications of the state of the nation to its\r\nrepresentatives. Generally these communications have been of the most\r\ngratifying nature, testifying an advance in all the improvements of\r\nsocial and all the securities of political life. But frequently and\r\njustly as you have been called on to be grateful for the bounties of\r\nProvidence, at few periods have they been more abundantly or extensively\r\nbestowed than at the present; rarely, if ever, have we had greater\r\nreason to congratulate each other on the continued and increasing\r\nprosperity of our beloved country.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, the first and most important occupation of man, has\r\ncompensated the labors of the husbandman with plentiful crops of all the\r\nvaried products of our extensive country. Manufactures have been\r\nestablished in which the funds of the capitalist find a profitable\r\ninvestment, and which give employment and subsistence to a numerous and\r\nincreasing body of industrious and dexterous mechanics. The laborer is\r\nrewarded by high wages in the construction of works of internal\r\nimprovement, which are extending with unprecedented rapidity. Science is\r\nsteadily penetrating the recesses of nature and disclosing her secrets,\r\nwhile the ingenuity of free minds is subjecting the elements to the\r\npower of man and making each new conquest auxiliary to his comfort. By\r\nour mails, whose speed is regularly increased and whose routes are every\r\nyear extended, the communication of public intelligence and private\r\nbusiness is rendered frequent and safe; the intercourse between distant\r\ncities, which it formerly required weeks to accomplish, is now effected\r\nin a few days; and in the construction of railroads and the application\r\nof steam power we have a reasonable prospect that the extreme parts of\r\nour country will be so much approximated and those most isolated by the\r\nobstacles of nature rendered so accessible as to remove an apprehension\r\nsometimes entertained that the great extent of the Union would endanger\r\nits permanent existence.\r\n\r\nIf from the satisfactory view of our agriculture, manufactures, and\r\ninternal improvements we turn to the state of our navigation and trade\r\nwith foreign nations and between the States, we shall scarcely find less\r\ncause for gratulation. A beneficent Providence has provided for their\r\nexercise and encouragement an extensive coast, indented by capacious\r\nbays, noble rivers, inland seas; with a country productive of every\r\nmaterial for shipbuilding and every commodity for gainful commerce, and\r\nfilled with a population active, intelligent, well-informed, and\r\nfearless of danger. These advantages are not neglected, and an impulse\r\nhas lately been given to commercial enterprise, which fills our\r\nshipyards with new constructions, encourages all the arts and branches\r\nof industry connected with them, crowds the wharves of our cities with\r\nvessels, and covers the most distant seas with our canvas.\r\n\r\nLet us be grateful for these blessings to the beneficent Being who has\r\nconferred them, and who suffers us to indulge a reasonable hope of their\r\ncontinuance and extension, while we neglect not the means by which they\r\nmay be preserved. If we may dare to judge of His future designs by the\r\nmanner in which His past favors have been bestowed, He has made our\r\nnational prosperity to depend on the preservation of our liberties, our\r\nnational force on our Federal Union, and our individual happiness on the\r\nmaintenance of our State rights and wise institutions. If we are\r\nprosperous at home and respected abroad, it is because we are free,\r\nunited, industrious, and obedient to the laws. While we continue so we\r\nshall by the blessing of Heaven go on in the happy career we have begun,\r\nand which has brought us in the short period of our political existence\r\nfrom a population of three to thirteen millions; from thirteen separate\r\ncolonies to twenty-four united States; from weakness to strength; from a\r\nrank scarcely marked in the scale of nations to a high place in their\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThis last advantage is one that has resulted in a great degree from the\r\nprinciples which have guided our intercourse with foreign powers since\r\nwe have assumed an equal station among them, and hence the annual\r\naccount which the Executive renders to the country of the manner in\r\nwhich that branch of his duties has been fulfilled proves instructive\r\nand salutary.\r\n\r\nThe pacific and wise policy of our Government kept us in a state of\r\nneutrality during the wars that have at different periods since our\r\npolitical existence been carried on by other powers; but this policy,\r\nwhile it gave activity and extent to our commerce, exposed it in the\r\nsame proportion to injuries from the belligerent nations. Hence have\r\narisen claims of indemnity for those injuries. England, France, Spain,\r\nHolland, Sweden, Denmark, Naples, and lately Portugal had all in a\r\ngreater or less degree infringed our neutral rights. Demands for\r\nreparation were made upon all. They have had in all, and continue to\r\nhave in some, cases a leading influence on the nature of our relations\r\nwith the powers on whom they were made.\r\n\r\nOf the claims upon England it is unnecessary to speak further than to\r\nsay that the state of things to which their prosecution and denial gave\r\nrise has been succeeded by arrangements productive of mutual good\r\nfeeling and amicable relations between the two countries, which it is\r\nhoped will not be interrupted. One of these arrangements is that\r\nrelating to the colonial trade which was communicated to Congress at the\r\nlast session; and although the short period during which it has been in\r\nforce will not enable me to form an accurate judgment of its operation,\r\nthere is every reason to believe that it will prove highly beneficial.\r\nThe trade thereby authorized has employed to the 30th September last\r\nupward of 30,000 tons of American and 15,000 tons of foreign shipping in\r\nthe outward voyages, and in the inward nearly an equal amount of\r\nAmerican and 20,000 only of foreign tonnage. Advantages, too, have\r\nresulted to our agricultural interests from the state of the trade\r\nbetween Canada and our Territories and States bordering on the St.\r\nLawrence and the Lakes which may prove more than equivalent to the loss\r\nsustained by the discrimination made to favor the trade of the northern\r\ncolonies with the West Indies.\r\n\r\nAfter our transition from the state of colonies to that of an\r\nindependent nation many points were found necessary to be settled\r\nbetween us and Great Britain. Among them was the demarcation of\r\nboundaries not described with sufficient precision in the treaty of\r\npeace. Some of the lines that divide the States and Territories of the\r\nUnited States from the British Provinces have been definitively fixed.\r\nThat, however, which separates us from the Provinces of Canada and New\r\nBrunswick to the north and the east was still in dispute when I came\r\ninto office, but I found arrangements made for its settlement over which\r\nI had no control. The commissioners who had been appointed under the\r\nprovisions of the treaty of Ghent having been unable to agree, a\r\nconvention was made with Great Britain by my immediate predecessor in\r\noffice, with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which it was\r\nagreed \"that the points of difference which have arisen in the\r\nsettlement of the boundary line between the American and British\r\ndominions, as described in the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent,\r\nshall be referred, as therein provided, to some friendly sovereign or\r\nState, who shall be invited to investigate and make a decision upon such\r\npoints of difference;\" and the King of the Netherlands having by the\r\nlate President and His Britannic Majesty been designated as such\r\nfriendly sovereign, it became my duty to carry with good faith the\r\nagreement so made into full effect. To this end I caused all the\r\nmeasures to be taken which were necessary to a full exposition of our\r\ncase to the sovereign arbiter, and nominated as minister plenipotentiary\r\nto his Court a distinguished citizen of the State most interested in the\r\nquestion, and who had been one of the agents previously employed for\r\nsettling the controversy. On the 10th day of January last His Majesty\r\nthe King of the Netherlands delivered to the plenipotentiaries of the\r\nUnited States and of Great Britain his written opinion on the case\r\nreferred to him. The papers in relation to the subject will be\r\ncommunicated by a special message to the proper branch of the Government\r\nwith the perfect confidence that its wisdom will adopt such measures as\r\nwill secure an amicable settlement of the controversy without infringing\r\nany constitutional right of the States immediately interested.\r\n\r\nIt affords me satisfaction to inform you that suggestions made by my\r\ndirection to the chargé d'affaires of His Britannic Majesty to this\r\nGovernment have had their desired effect in producing the release of\r\ncertain American citizens who were imprisoned for setting up the\r\nauthority of the State of Maine at a place in the disputed territory\r\nunder the actual jurisdiction of His Britannic Majesty. From this and\r\nthe assurances I have received of the desire of the local authorities to\r\navoid any cause of collision I have the best hopes that a good\r\nunderstanding will be kept up until it is confirmed by the final\r\ndisposition of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe amicable relations which now subsist between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, the increasing intercourse between their citizens, and\r\nthe rapid obliteration of unfriendly prejudices to which former events\r\nnaturally gave rise concurred to present this as a fit period for\r\nrenewing our endeavors to provide against the recurrence of causes of\r\nirritation which in the event of war between Great Britain and any other\r\npower would inevitably endanger our peace. Animated by the sincerest\r\ndesire to avoid such a state of things, and peacefully to secure under\r\nall possible circumstances the rights and honor of the country, I have\r\ngiven such instructions to the minister lately sent to the Court of\r\nLondon as will evince that desire, and if met by a correspondent\r\ndisposition, which we can not doubt, will put an end to causes of\r\ncollision which, without advantage to either, tend to estrange from each\r\nother two nations who have every motive to preserve not only peace, but\r\nan intercourse of the most amicable nature.\r\n\r\nIn my message at the opening of the last session of Congress I expressed\r\na confident hope that the justice of our claims upon France, urged as\r\nthey were with perseverance and signal ability by our minister there,\r\nwould finally be acknowledged. This hope has been realized. A treaty has\r\nbeen signed which will immediately be laid before the Senate for its\r\napprobation, and which, containing stipulations that require legislative\r\nacts, must have the concurrence of both Houses before it can be carried\r\ninto effect. By it the French Government engage to pay a sum which, if\r\nnot quite equal to that which may be found due to our citizens, will\r\nyet, it is believed, under all circumstances, be deemed satisfactory by\r\nthose interested. The offer of a gross sum instead of the satisfaction\r\nof each individual claim was accepted because the only alternatives were\r\na rigorous exaction of the whole amount stated to be due on each claim,\r\nwhich might in some instances be exaggerated by design, in others\r\noverrated through error, and which, therefore, it would have been both\r\nungracious and unjust to have insisted on; or a settlement by a mixed\r\ncommission, to which the French negotiators were very averse, and which\r\nexperience in other cases had shewn to be dilatory and often wholly\r\ninadequate to the end. A comparatively small sum is stipulated on our\r\npart to go to the extinction of all claims by French citizens on our\r\nGovernment, and a reduction of duties on our cotton and their wines has\r\nbeen agreed on as a consideration for the renunciation of an important\r\nclaim for commercial privileges under the construction they gave to the\r\ntreaty for the cession of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nShould this treaty receive the proper sanction, a source of irritation\r\nwill be stopped that has for so many years in some degree alienated from\r\neach other two nations who, from interest as well as the remembrance of\r\nearly associations, ought to cherish the most friendly relations; an\r\nencouragement will be given for perseverance in the demands of justice\r\nby this new proof that if steadily pursued they will be listened to, and\r\nadmonition will be offered to those powers, if any, which may be\r\ninclined to evade them that they will never be abandoned; above all, a\r\njust confidence will be inspired in our fellow-citizens that their\r\nGovernment will exert all the powers with which they have invested it in\r\nsupport of their just claims upon foreign nations; at the same time that\r\nthe frank acknowledgment and provision for the payment of those which\r\nwere addressed to our equity, although unsupported by legal proof,\r\naffords a practical illustration of our submission to the divine rule of\r\ndoing to others what we desire they should do unto us.\r\n\r\nSweden and Denmark having made compensation for the irregularities\r\ncommitted by their vessels or in their ports to the perfect satisfaction\r\nof the parties concerned, and having renewed the treaties of commerce\r\nentered into with them, our political and commercial relations with\r\nthose powers continue to be on the most friendly footing.\r\n\r\nWith Spain our differences up to the 22d of February, 1819, were settled\r\nby the treaty of Washington of that date, but at a subsequent period our\r\ncommerce with the States formerly colonies of Spain on the continent of\r\nAmerica was annoyed and frequently interrupted by her public and private\r\narmed ships. They captured many of our vessels prosecuting a lawful\r\ncommerce and sold them and their cargoes, and at one time to our demands\r\nfor restoration and indemnity opposed the allegation that they were\r\ntaken in the violation of a blockade of all the ports of those States.\r\nThis blockade was declaratory only, and the inadequacy of the force to\r\nmaintain it was so manifest that this allegation was varied to a charge\r\nof trade in contraband of war. This, in its turn, was also found\r\nuntenable, and the minister whom I sent with instructions to press for\r\nthe reparation that was due to our injured fellow-citizens has\r\ntransmitted an answer to his demand by which the captures are declared\r\nto have been legal, and are justified because the independence of the\r\nStates of America never having been acknowledged by Spain she had a\r\nright to prohibit trade with them under her old colonial laws. This\r\nground of defense was contradictory, not only to those which had been\r\nformerly alleged, but to the uniform practice and established laws of\r\nnations, and had been abandoned by Spain herself in the convention which\r\ngranted indemnity to British subjects for captures made at the same\r\ntime, under the same circumstances, and for the same allegations with\r\nthose of which we complain.\r\n\r\nI, however, indulge the hope that further reflection will lead to other\r\nviews, and feel confident that when His Catholic Majesty shall be\r\nconvinced of the justice of the claims his desire to preserve friendly\r\nrelations between the two countries, which it is my earnest endeavor to\r\nmaintain, will induce him to accede to our demand. I have therefore\r\ndispatched a special messenger with instructions to our minister to\r\nbring the case once more to his consideration, to the end that if (which\r\nI can not bring myself to believe) the same decision (that can not but\r\nbe deemed an unfriendly denial of justice) should be persisted in the\r\nmatter may before your adjournment be laid before you, the\r\nconstitutional judges of what is proper to be done when negotiation for\r\nredress of injury fails.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of a treaty for indemnity with France seemed to present a\r\nfavorable opportunity to renew our claims of a similar nature on other\r\npowers, and particularly in the case of those upon Naples, more\r\nespecially as in the course of former negotiations with that power our\r\nfailure to induce France to render us justice was used as an argument\r\nagainst us. The desires of the merchants, who were the principal\r\nsufferers, have therefore been acceded to, and a mission has been\r\ninstituted for the special purpose of obtaining for them a reparation\r\nalready too long delayed. This measure having been resolved on, it was\r\nput in execution without waiting for the meeting of Congress, because\r\nthe state of Europe created an apprehension of events that might have\r\nrendered our application ineffectual.\r\n\r\nOur demands upon the Government of the Two Sicilies are of a peculiar\r\nnature. The injuries on which they are founded are not denied, nor are\r\nthe atrocity and perfidy under which those injuries were perpetrated\r\nattempted to be extenuated. The sole ground on which indemnity has been\r\nrefused is the alleged illegality of the tenure by which the monarch who\r\nmade the seizures held his crown. This defense, always unfounded in any\r\nprinciple of the law of nations, now universally abandoned, even by\r\nthose powers upon whom the responsibility for acts of past rulers bore\r\nthe most heavily, will unquestionably be given up by His Sicilian\r\nMajesty, whose counsels will receive an impulse from that high sense of\r\nhonor and regard to justice which are said to characterize him; and I\r\nfeel the fullest confidence that the talents of the citizen commissioned\r\nfor that purpose will place before him the just claims of our injured\r\ncitizens in such a light as will enable me before your adjournment to\r\nannounce that they have been adjusted and secured. Precise instructions\r\nto the effect of bringing the negotiation to a speedy issue have been\r\ngiven, and will be obeyed.\r\n\r\nIn the late blockade of Terceira some of the Portuguese fleet captured\r\nseveral of our vessels and committed other excesses, for which\r\nreparation was demanded, and I was on the point of dispatching an armed\r\nforce to prevent any recurrence of a similar violence and protect our\r\ncitizens in the prosecution of their lawful commerce when official\r\nassurances, on which I relied, made the sailing of the ships\r\nunnecessary. Since that period frequent promises have been made that\r\nfull indemnity shall be given for the injuries inflicted and the losses\r\nsustained. In the performance there has been some, perhaps unavoidable,\r\ndelay; but I have the fullest confidence that my earnest desire that\r\nthis business may at once be closed, which our minister has been\r\ninstructed strongly to express, will very soon be gratified. I have the\r\nbetter ground for this hope from the evidence of a friendly disposition\r\nwhich that Government has shown by an actual reduction in the duty on\r\nrice the produce of our Southern States, authorizing the anticipation\r\nthat this important article of our export will soon be admitted on the\r\nsame footing with that produced by the most favored nation.\r\n\r\nWith the other powers of Europe we have fortunately had no cause of\r\ndiscussions for the redress of injuries. With the Empire of the Russias\r\nour political connection is of the most friendly and our commercial of\r\nthe most liberal kind. We enjoy the advantages of navigation and trade\r\ngiven to the most favored nation, but it has not yet suited their\r\npolicy, or perhaps has not been found convenient from other\r\nconsiderations, to give stability and reciprocity to those privileges by\r\na commercial treaty. The ill health of the minister last year charged\r\nwith making a proposition for that arrangement did not permit him to\r\nremain at St. Petersburg, and the attention of that Government during\r\nthe whole of the period since his departure having been occupied by the\r\nwar in which it was engaged, we have been assured that nothing could\r\nhave been effected by his presence. A minister will soon be nominated,\r\nas well to effect this important object as to keep up the relations of\r\namity and good understanding of which we have received so many\r\nassurances and proofs from His Imperial Majesty and the Emperor his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Austria is opening to us an important trade with the\r\nhereditary dominions of the Emperor, the value of which has been\r\nhitherto little known, and of course not sufficiently appreciated. While\r\nour commerce finds an entrance into the south of Germany by means of\r\nthis treaty, those we have formed with the Hanseatic towns and Prussia\r\nand others now in negotiation will open that vast country to the\r\nenterprising spirit of our merchants on the north--a country abounding\r\nin all the materials for a mutually beneficial commerce, filled with\r\nenlightened and industrious inhabitants, holding an important place in\r\nthe politics of Europe, and to which we owe so many valuable citizens.\r\nThe ratification of the treaty with the Porte was sent to be exchanged\r\nby the gentleman appointed our chargé d'affaires to that Court. Some\r\ndifficulties occurred on his arrival, but at the date of his last\r\nofficial dispatch he supposed they had been obviated and that there was\r\nevery prospect of the exchange being speedily effected.\r\n\r\nThis finishes the connected view I have thought it proper to give of our\r\npolitical and commercial relations in Europe. Every effort in my power\r\nwill be continued to strengthen and extend them by treaties founded on\r\nprinciples of the most perfect reciprocity of interest, neither asking\r\nnor conceding any exclusive advantage, but liberating as far as it lies\r\nin my power the activity and industry of our fellow-citizens from the\r\nshackles which foreign restrictions may impose.\r\n\r\nTo China and the East Indies our commerce continues in its usual extent,\r\nand with increased facilities which the credit and capital of our\r\nmerchants afford by substituting bills for payments in specie. A daring\r\noutrage having been committed in those seas by the plunder of one of our\r\nmerchantmen engaged in the pepper trade at a port in Sumatra, and the\r\npiratical perpetrators belonging to tribes in such a state of society\r\nthat the usual course of proceedings between civilized nations could not\r\nbe pursued, I forthwith dispatched a frigate with orders to require\r\nimmediate satisfaction for the injury and indemnity to the sufferers.\r\n\r\nFew changes have taken place in our connections with the independent\r\nStates of America since my last communication to Congress. The\r\nratification of a commercial treaty with the United Republics of Mexico\r\nhas been for some time under deliberation in their Congress, but was\r\nstill undecided at the date of our last dispatches. The unhappy civil\r\ncommotions that have prevailed there were undoubtedly the cause of the\r\ndelay, but as the Government is now said to be tranquillized we may hope\r\nsoon to receive the ratification of the treaty and an arrangement for\r\nthe demarcation of the boundaries between us. In the meantime, an\r\nimportant trade has been opened with mutual benefit from St. Louis, in\r\nthe State of Missouri, by caravans to the interior Provinces of Mexico.\r\nThis commerce is protected in its progress through the Indian countries\r\nby the troops of the United States, which have been permitted to escort\r\nthe caravans beyond our boundaries to the settled part of the Mexican\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nFrom Central America I have received assurances of the most friendly\r\nkind and a gratifying application for our good offices to remove a\r\nsupposed indisposition toward that Government in a neighboring State.\r\nThis application was immediately and successfully complied with. They\r\ngave us also the pleasing intelligence that differences which had\r\nprevailed in their internal affairs had been peaceably adjusted. Our\r\ntreaty with this Republic continues to be faithfully observed, and\r\npromises a great and beneficial commerce between the two countries--a\r\ncommerce of the greatest importance if the magnificent project of a ship\r\ncanal through the dominions of that State from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific Ocean, now in serious contemplation, shall be executed.\r\n\r\nI have great satisfaction in communicating the success which has\r\nattended the exertions of our minister in Colombia to procure a very\r\nconsiderable reduction in the duties on our flour in that Republic.\r\nIndemnity also has been stipulated for injuries received by our\r\nmerchants from illegal seizures, and renewed assurances are given that\r\nthe treaty between the two countries shall be faithfully observed.\r\n\r\nChili and Peru seem to be still threatened with civil commotions, and\r\nuntil they shall be settled disorders may naturally be apprehended,\r\nrequiring the constant presence of a naval force in the Pacific Ocean to\r\nprotect our fisheries and guard our commerce.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances that took place in the Empire of Brazil previously to\r\nand immediately consequent upon the abdication of the late Emperor\r\nnecessarily suspended any effectual application for the redress of some\r\npast injuries suffered by our citizens from that Government, while they\r\nhave been the cause of others, in which all foreigners seem to have\r\nparticipated. Instructions have been given to our minister there to\r\npress for indemnity due for losses occasioned by these irregularities,\r\nand to take care that our fellow-citizens shall enjoy all the privileges\r\nstipulated in their favor by the treaty lately made between the two\r\npowers, all which the good intelligence that prevails between our\r\nminister at Rio Janeiro and the Regency gives us the best reason to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nI should have placed Buenos Ayres in the list of South American powers\r\nin respect to which nothing of importance affecting us was to be\r\ncommunicated but for occurrences which have lately taken place at the\r\nFalkland Islands, in which the name of that Republic has been used to\r\ncover with a show of authority acts injurious to our commerce and to the\r\nproperty and liberty of our fellow-citizens. In the course of the\r\npresent year one of our vessels, engaged in the pursuit of a trade which\r\nwe have always enjoyed without molestation, has been captured by a band\r\nacting, as they pretend, under the authority of the Government of Buenos\r\nAyres. I have therefore given orders for the dispatch of an armed vessel\r\nto join our squadron in those seas and aid in affording all lawful\r\nprotection to our trade which shall be necessary, and shall without\r\ndelay send a minister to inquire into the nature of the circumstances\r\nand also of the claim, if any, that is set up by that Government to\r\nthose islands. In the meantime, I submit the case to the consideration\r\nof Congress, to the end that they may clothe the Executive with such\r\nauthority and means as they may deem necessary for providing a force\r\nadequate to the complete protection of our fellow-citizens fishing and\r\ntrading in those seas.\r\n\r\nThis rapid sketch of our foreign relations, it is hoped,\r\nfellow-citizens, may be of some use in so much of your legislation as\r\nmay bear on that important subject, while it affords to the country at\r\nlarge a source of high gratification in the contemplation of our\r\npolitical and commercial connection with the rest of the world. At peace\r\nwith all; having subjects of future difference with few, and those\r\nsusceptible of easy adjustment; extending our commerce gradually on all\r\nsides and on none by any but the most liberal and mutually beneficial\r\nmeans, we may, by the blessing of Providence, hope for all that national\r\nprosperity which can be derived from an intercourse with foreign\r\nnations, guided by those eternal principles of justice and reciprocal\r\ngood will which are binding as well upon States as the individuals of\r\nwhom they are composed.\r\n\r\nI have great satisfaction in making this statement of our affairs,\r\nbecause the course of our national policy enables me to do it without\r\nany indiscreet exposure of what in other governments is usually\r\nconcealed from the people. Having none but a straightforward, open\r\ncourse to pursue, guided by a single principle that will bear the\r\nstrongest light, we have happily no political combinations to form, no\r\nalliances to entangle us, no complicated interests to consult, and in\r\nsubjecting all we have done to the consideration of our citizens and to\r\nthe inspection of the world we give no advantage to other nations and\r\nlay ourselves open to no injury.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to add that to preserve this state of things and\r\ngive confidence to the world in the integrity of our designs all our\r\nconsular and diplomatic agents are strictly enjoined to examine well\r\nevery cause of complaint preferred by our citizens, and while they urge\r\nwith proper earnestness those that are well founded, to countenance none\r\nthat are unreasonable or unjust, and to enjoin on our merchants and\r\nnavigators the strictest obedience to the laws of the countries to which\r\nthey resort, and a course of conduct in their dealings that may support\r\nthe character of our nation and render us respected abroad.\r\n\r\nConnected with this subject, I must recommend a revisal of our consular\r\nlaws. Defects and omissions have been discovered in their operation that\r\nought to be remedied and supplied. For your further information on this\r\nsubject I have directed a report to be made by the Secretary of State,\r\nwhich I shall hereafter submit to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe internal peace and security of our confederated States is the next\r\nprincipal object of the General Government. Time and experience have\r\nproved that the abode of the native Indian within their limits is\r\ndangerous to their peace and injurious to himself. In accordance with my\r\nrecommendation at a former session of Congress, an appropriation of half\r\na million of dollars was made to aid the voluntary removal of the\r\nvarious tribes beyond the limits of the States. At the last session I\r\nhad the happiness to announce that the Chickasaws and Choctaws had\r\naccepted the generous offer of the Government and agreed to remove\r\nbeyond the Mississippi River, by which the whole of the State of\r\nMississippi and the western part of Alabama will be freed from Indian\r\noccupancy and opened to a civilized population. The treaties with these\r\ntribes are in a course of execution, and their removal, it is hoped,\r\nwill be completed in the course of 1832.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the authorities of Georgia the registration of\r\nCherokee Indians for emigration has been resumed, and it is confidently\r\nexpected that one-half, if not two-thirds, of that tribe will follow the\r\nwise example of their more westerly brethren. Those who prefer remaining\r\nat their present homes will hereafter be governed by the laws of\r\nGeorgia, as all her citizens are, and cease to be the objects of\r\npeculiar care on the part of the General Government.\r\n\r\nDuring the present year the attention of the Government has been\r\nparticularly directed to those tribes in the powerful and growing State\r\nof Ohio, where considerable tracts of the finest lands were still\r\noccupied by the aboriginal proprietors. Treaties, either absolute or\r\nconditional, have been made extinguishing the whole Indian title to the\r\nreservations in that State, and the time is not distant, it is hoped,\r\nwhen Ohio will be no longer embarrassed with the Indian population. The\r\nsame measures will be extended to Indiana as soon as there is reason to\r\nanticipate success. It is confidently believed that perseverance for a\r\nfew years in the present policy of the Government will extinguish the\r\nIndian title to all lands lying within the States composing our Federal\r\nUnion, and remove beyond their limits every Indian who is not willing to\r\nsubmit to their laws. Thus will all conflicting claims to jurisdiction\r\nbetween the States and the Indian tribes be put to rest. It is pleasing\r\nto reflect that results so beneficial, not only to the States\r\nimmediately concerned, but to the harmony of the Union, will have been\r\naccomplished by measures equally advantageous to the Indians. What the\r\nnative savages become when surrounded by a dense population and by\r\nmixing with the whites may be seen in the miserable remnants of a few\r\nEastern tribes, deprived of political and civil rights, forbidden to\r\nmake contracts, and subjected to guardians, dragging out a wretched\r\nexistence, without excitement, without hope, and almost without thought.\r\n\r\nBut the removal of the Indians beyond the limits and jurisdiction of the\r\nStates does not place them beyond the reach of philanthropic aid and\r\nChristian instruction. On the contrary, those whom philanthropy or\r\nreligion may induce to live among them in their new abode will be more\r\nfree in the exercise of their benevolent functions than if they had\r\nremained within the limits of the States, embarrassed by their internal\r\nregulations. Now subject to no control but the superintending agency of\r\nthe General Government, exercised with the sole view of preserving\r\npeace, they may proceed unmolested in the interesting experiment of\r\ngradually advancing a community of American Indians from barbarism to\r\nthe habits and enjoyments of civilized life.\r\n\r\nAmong the happiest effects of the improved relations of our Republic has\r\nbeen an increase of trade, producing a corresponding increase of revenue\r\nbeyond the most sanguine anticipations of the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nThe state of the public finances will be fully shown by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury in the report which he will presently lay before you. I\r\nwill here, however, congratulate you upon their prosperous condition.\r\nThe revenue received in the present year will not fall short of\r\n$27,700,000, and the expenditures for all objects other than the public\r\ndebt will not exceed $14,700,000. The payment on account of the\r\nprincipal and interest of the debt during the year will exceed\r\n$16,500,000, a greater sum than has been applied to that object out of\r\nthe revenue in any year since the enlargement of the sinking fund except\r\nthe two years following immediately thereafter. The amount which will\r\nhave been applied to the public debt from the 4th of March, 1829, to the\r\n1st of January next, which is less than three years since the\r\nAdministration has been placed in my hands, will exceed $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nFrom the large importations of the present year it may be safely\r\nestimated that the revenue which will be received into the Treasury from\r\nthat source during the next year, with the aid of that received from the\r\npublic lands, will considerably exceed the amount of the receipts of the\r\npresent year; and it is believed that with the means which the\r\nGovernment will have at its disposal from various sources, which will be\r\nfully stated by the proper Department, the whole of the public debt may\r\nbe extinguished, either by redemption or purchase, within the four years\r\nof my Administration. We shall then exhibit the rare example of a great\r\nnation, abounding in all the means of happiness and security, altogether\r\nfree from debt.\r\n\r\nThe confidence with which the extinguishment of the public debt may be\r\nanticipated presents an opportunity for carrying into effect more fully\r\nthe policy in relation to import duties which has been recommended in my\r\nformer messages. A modification of the tariff which shall produce a\r\nreduction of our revenue to the wants of the Government and an\r\nadjustment of the duties on imports with a view to equal justice in\r\nrelation to all our national interests and to the counteraction of\r\nforeign policy so far as it may be injurious to those interests, is\r\ndeemed to be one of the principal objects which demand the consideration\r\nof the present Congress. Justice to the interests of the merchant as\r\nwell as the manufacturer requires that material reductions in the import\r\nduties be prospective; and unless the present Congress shall dispose of\r\nthe subject the proposed reductions can not properly be made to take\r\neffect at the period when the necessity for the revenue arising from\r\npresent rates shall cease. It is therefore desirable that arrangements\r\nbe adopted at your present session to relieve the people from\r\nunnecessary taxation after the extinguishment of the public debt. In the\r\nexercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which has\r\ndistinguished the friends of our Union in all great emergencies, it is\r\nbelieved that this object may be effected without injury to any national\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message of December, 1829, I had the honor to recommend the\r\nadoption of a more liberal policy than that which then prevailed toward\r\nunfortunate debtors to the Government, and I deem it my duty again to\r\ninvite your attention to this subject.\r\n\r\nActuated by similar views, Congress at their last session passed an act\r\nfor the relief of certain insolvent debtors of the United States, but\r\nthe provisions of that law have not been deemed such as were adequate to\r\nthat relief to this unfortunate class of our fellow-citizens which may\r\nbe safely extended to them. The points in which the law appears to be\r\ndefective will be particularly communicated by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and I take pleasure in recommending such an extension of its\r\nprovisions as will unfetter the enterprise of a valuable portion of our\r\ncitizens and restore to them the means of usefulness to themselves and\r\nthe community. While deliberating on this subject I would also recommend\r\nto your consideration the propriety of so modifying the laws for\r\nenforcing the payment of debts due either to the public or to\r\nindividuals suing in the courts of the United States as to restrict the\r\nimprisonment of the person to cases of fraudulent concealment of\r\nproperty. The personal liberty of the citizen seems too sacred to be\r\nheld, as in many cases it now is, at the will of a creditor to whom he\r\nis willing to surrender all the means he has of discharging his debt.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the Secretaries of the War and Navy Departments and\r\nfrom the Postmaster-General, which accompany this message, present\r\nsatisfactory views of the operations of the Departments respectively\r\nunder their charge, and suggest improvements which are worthy of and to\r\nwhich I invite the serious attention of Congress. Certain defects and\r\nomissions having been discovered in the operation of the laws respecting\r\npatents, they are pointed out in the accompanying report from the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution\r\ngiving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and\r\nlimiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I\r\nconsider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in\r\naccordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the\r\nconsideration of a new Congress. For my views more at large, as well in\r\nrelation to these points as to the disqualification of members of\r\nCongress to receive an office from a President in whose election they\r\nhave had an official agency, which I proposed as a substitute, I refer\r\nyou to my former messages.\r\n\r\nOur system of public accounts is extremely complicated, and it is\r\nbelieved may be much improved. Much of the present machinery and a\r\nconsiderable portion of the expenditure of public money may be dispensed\r\nwith, while greater facilities can be afforded to the liquidation of\r\nclaims upon the Government and an examination into their justice and\r\nlegality quite as efficient as the present secured. With a view to a\r\ngeneral reform in the system, I recommend the subject to the attention\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty again to call your attention to the condition of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. It was doubtless wise in the framers of our\r\nConstitution to place the people of this District under the jurisdiction\r\nof the General Government, but to accomplish the objects they had in\r\nview it is not necessary that this people should be deprived of all the\r\nprivileges of self-government. Independently of the difficulty of\r\ninducing the representatives of distant States to turn their attention\r\nto projects of laws which are not of the highest interest to their\r\nconstituents, they are not individually, nor in Congress collectively,\r\nwell qualified to legislate over the local concerns of this District.\r\nConsequently its interests are much neglected, and the people are almost\r\nafraid to present their grievances, lest a body in which they are not\r\nrepresented and which feels little sympathy in their local relations\r\nshould in its attempt to make laws for them do more harm than good.\r\nGoverned by the laws of the States whence they were severed, the two\r\nshores of the Potomac within the 10 miles square have different penal\r\ncodes--not the present codes of Virginia and Mary land, but such as\r\nexisted in those States at the time of the cession to the United States.\r\nAs Congress will not form a new code, and as the people of the District\r\ncan not make one for themselves, they are virtually under two\r\ngovernments. Is it not just to allow them at least a Delegate in\r\nCongress, if not a local legislature, to make laws for the District,\r\nsubject to the approval or rejection of Congress? I earnestly recommend\r\nthe extension to them of every political right which their interests\r\nrequire and which may be compatible with the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the judiciary system of the United States is deemed to\r\nbe one of the duties of Government. One-fourth of the States in the\r\nUnion do not participate in the benefits of a circuit court. To the\r\nStates of Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, and\r\nLouisiana, admitted into the Union since the present judicial system was\r\norganized, only a district court has been allowed. If this be\r\nsufficient, then the circuit courts already existing in eighteen States\r\nought to be abolished; if it be not sufficient, the defect ought to be\r\nremedied, and these States placed on the same footing with the other\r\nmembers of the Union. It was on this condition and on this footing that\r\nthey entered the Union, and they may demand circuit courts as a matter\r\nnot of concession, but of right. I trust that Congress will not adjourn\r\nleaving this anomaly in our system.\r\n\r\nEntertaining the opinions heretofore expressed in relation to the Bank\r\nof the United States as at present organized, I felt it my duty in my\r\nformer messages frankly to disclose them, in order that the attention of\r\nthe Legislature and the people should be seasonably directed to that\r\nimportant subject, and that it might be considered and finally disposed\r\nof in a manner best calculated to promote the ends of the Constitution\r\nand subserve the public interests. Having thus conscientiously\r\ndischarged a constitutional duty, I deem it proper on this occasion,\r\nwithout a more particular reference to the views of the subject then\r\nexpressed, to leave it for the present to the investigation of an\r\nenlightened people and their representatives.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion permit me to invoke that Power which superintends all\r\ngovernments to infuse into your deliberations at this important crisis\r\nof our history a spirit of mutual forbearance and conciliation. In that\r\nspirit was our Union formed, and in that spirit must it be preserved.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _December 6, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their advice with regard to its\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States and France, signed at\r\nParis by the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on the 4th of\r\nJuly, 1831.\r\n\r\nWith the treaty are also transmitted the dispatch which accompanied it,\r\nand two others on the same subject received since.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 7, 1831_.\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn my public message to both Houses of Congress I communicated the state\r\nin which I had found the controverted claims of Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States in relation to our northern and eastern boundary, and the\r\nmeasures which since my coming into office I had pursued to bring it to\r\na close, together with the fact that on the 10th day of January last the\r\nsovereign arbiter had delivered his opinion to the plenipotentiaries of\r\nthe United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI now transmit to you that opinion for your consideration, that you may\r\ndetermine whether you will advise submission to the opinion delivered by\r\nthe sovereign arbiter and consent to its execution.\r\n\r\nThat you may the better be enabled to judge of the obligation as well as\r\nthe expediency of submitting to or rejecting the decision of the\r\narbiter, I herewith transmit--\r\n\r\n1. A protest made by the minister plenipotentiary of the United States\r\nafter receiving the opinion of the King of the Netherlands, on which\r\npaper it may be necessary to remark that I had always determined,\r\nwhatever might have been the result of the examination by the sovereign\r\narbiter, to have submitted the same to the Senate for their advice\r\nbefore I executed or rejected it. Therefore no instructions were given\r\nto the ministers to do any act that should commit the Government as to\r\nthe course it might deem proper to pursue on a full consideration of all\r\nthe circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n2. The dispatches from our minister at The Hague accompanying the\r\nprotest, as well as those previous and subsequent thereto, in relation\r\nto the subject of the submission.\r\n\r\n3. Communications between the Department of State and the governor of\r\nthe State of Maine in relation to this subject.\r\n\r\n4. Correspondence between the chargé d'affaires of His Britannic Majesty\r\nand the Department of State in relation to the arrest of certain persons\r\nat Madawasca under the authority of the British Government at New\r\nBrunswick.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that in addition to the evidence derived from Mr.\r\nTreble's dispatches of the inclination of the British Government to\r\nabide by the award, assurances to the same effect have been uniformly\r\nmade to our minister at London, and that an official communication on\r\nthat subject may very soon be expected.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington City, _December 7, 1831_.\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, two letters from\r\nthe Secretary of State, accompanied by statements from that Department\r\nshowing the progress which has been made in taking the Fifth Census of\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States, and also by a printed copy of the\r\nrevision of the statements heretofore transmitted to Congress of all\r\nformer enumerations of the population of the United States and their\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _December 13, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying papers show the situation of extreme peril from which\r\nmore than sixty of our fellow-citizens have been rescued by the courage\r\nand humanity of the master and crew of a Spanish brig. As no property\r\nwas saved, there were no means of making pecuniary satisfaction for the\r\nrisk and loss incurred in performing this humane and meritorious\r\nservice. Believing, therefore, that the obligation devolved upon the\r\nnation, but having no funds at my disposal which I could think\r\nconstitutionally applicable to the case, I have thought honor as well as\r\njustice required that the facts should be submitted to the consideration\r\nof Congress, in order that they might provide not only a just indemnity\r\nfor the losses incurred, but some compensation adequate to the merits of\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 13, 1831_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, in obedience to a resolution of the Senate of the\r\n8th December, 1831, all the information in the possession of the\r\nExecutive relative to the capture, abduction, and imprisonment of\r\nAmerican citizens by the provincial authorities of New Brunswick, and\r\nthe measures which, in consequence thereof, have been adopted by the\r\nExecutive of the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 21, 1831_.\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, a report of the\r\nSecretary of State, respecting tonnage duties levied at Martinique and\r\nGuadaloupe on American vessels and on French vessels from those islands\r\nto the United States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 21, 1831_.\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nSince my message of the 7th instant, transmitting the award of the King\r\nof the Netherlands, I have received the official communication, then\r\nexpected, of the determination of the British Government to abide by the\r\naward. This communication is now respectfully laid before you for the\r\npurpose of aiding your deliberations on the same subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 29, 1831_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n19th instant, requesting the President of the United States to\r\ncommunicate to it \"the correspondence between the governor of Georgia\r\nand any Department of this Government, in the years 1830 and 1831, in\r\nrelation to the boundary line between the State of Georgia and the\r\nTerritory of Florida,\" I transmit herewith a communication from the\r\nSecretary of State, with copies of the papers referred to. It is proper\r\nto add, as the resolutions on this subject from the governor and\r\nlegislature of Georgia were received after the adjournment of the last\r\nCongress, and as that body, after having the same subject under\r\nconsideration, had failed to authorize the President to take any steps\r\nin relation to it, that it was my intention to present it in due time to\r\nthe attention of the present Congress by special message. This\r\ndetermination has been hastened by the call of the House for the\r\ninformation now communicated, and it only remains for me to await the\r\naction of Congress upon the subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for their advice and consent as to the\r\nratification of the same, a treaty between the United States and the\r\nprincipal chiefs and warriors of the mixed band of Seneca and Shawnee\r\nIndians living on the waters of the Great Miami and within the\r\nterritorial limits of the county of Logan, in the State of Ohio, entered\r\ninto on the 30th day of July, 1831; and also a treaty between the United\r\nStates and the chiefs, headmen, and warriors of the band of Ottaway\r\nIndians residing within the State of Ohio, entered into on the 30th of\r\nAugust, 1831.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 10, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report made by the Secretary of State on the\r\nsubject of a commercial arrangement with the Republic of Colombia, which\r\nrequires legislative action to carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for their advice and consent as to the\r\nratification of the same, a treaty made on the 8th of August last with\r\nthe Shawnee Indians.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 18, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, in answer to the\r\nresolution of the Senate of the 3d instant, and accompanied by copies of\r\nthe instructions and correspondence relative to the late treaty with\r\nFrance, called for by that resolution.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1832_.\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI respectfully invite the attention of Congress to the propriety of\r\ncompromising the title of the islands on which Fort Delaware stands in\r\nthe manner pointed out by the accompanying report from the War\r\nDepartment. This subject was presented to Congress during the last\r\nsession, but for want of time, it is believed, did not receive its\r\naction.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a copy of a\r\ncorrespondence between the late minister of Great Britain and the late\r\nSecretary of State of the United States on the subject of a claim of\r\nCyrenius Hall, a British subject and an inhabitant of Upper Canada, for\r\nthe loss which he alleges to have sustained in consequence of the\r\nimputed seizure of a schooner (his property) by the collector of the\r\ncustoms at Venice, in Sandusky Bay, in the year 1821, and the subsequent\r\nneglect of that officer in relation to the said schooner, together with\r\ncopies of the documents adduced in support of the claim, that such\r\nlegislative provision may be made in behalf of the claimant as shall\r\nappear just and proper in the case.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 24, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n20th instant, I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of War,\r\ncontaining all the information in possession of the Executive required\r\nby that resolution.\r\n\r\nFor the reason assigned by the Secretary in his report I have to request\r\nthat the abstracts of the Choctaw reservations may be returned to the\r\nWar Department when the House shall no longer require them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 26, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith reports from the Secretaries of the War and Navy\r\nDepartments, containing the information required by the resolution of\r\nthe House of the 5th instant, in regard to the expenditures on\r\nbreakwaters since 1815.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 18th instant, I\r\nherewith transmit a report[12] of the Secretary of State, which,\r\ntogether with the letter of His Britannic Majesty's chargé d'affaires\r\nheretofore communicated, demanding the execution of the opinion\r\ndelivered by the sovereign arbiter, contains all the information\r\nrequested by the said resolution, omitting nothing that may enable the\r\nSenate to give the advice requested by my message of the 7th of December\r\nlast, on the question of carrying into effect the opinion of the King of\r\nthe Netherlands.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Relating to the northeastern boundary of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 27, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSince the dismission of Lieutenant Hampton Westcott for participating as\r\nsecond in a duel in March, A.D. 1830, a more particular investigation of\r\nthe circumstances has resulted in exonerating him from having instigated\r\nthe fatal meeting, and the said Westcott, on a trial by a jury, has been\r\nacquitted of all legal guilt in the transaction.\r\n\r\nI therefore nominate the said Hampton Westcott to be a lieutenant in the\r\nNavy of the United States from the 17th of May, 1828, his former date,\r\nand to take rank next after Richard R. McMullin.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 3, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the documents relating to the settlement of the\r\nnortheastern boundary of the United States now in possession of the\r\nSenate, I have just received certain proceedings and resolutions of the\r\nlegislature of the State of Maine on the subject, which are herewith\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d March, 1831, I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State\r\non the subject of the regulations of England, France, and the\r\nNetherlands respecting their fisheries.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON; _February 7, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA convention having been entered into between the United States and the\r\nKing of the French, it has been ratified with the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate; and my ratification having been exchanged in due form on the\r\n2d of February, 1832, by the Secretary of State and the envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the King of the French, it\r\nis now communicated to you for consideration in your legislative\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that some important conditions can not be carried into\r\nexecution but with the aid of the Legislature, and that the proper\r\nprovisions for that purpose seem to be required without delay.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA treaty of commerce and navigation having been entered into between the\r\nUnited States and the Sublime Porte, it has been ratified with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate; and my ratification having been\r\nexchanged in due form on the 5th October, 1831, by our chargé d'affaires\r\nat Constantinople and that Government, it is now communicated to both\r\nHouses of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of the Senate, a report from\r\nthe Department of War, showing the situation of the country at Green Bay\r\nceded for the benefit of the New York Indians, and also the proceedings\r\nof the commissioner, who has lately had a meeting with them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of War, made in compliance\r\nwith a resolution of the Senate of March 2, 1831, requesting the\r\nPresident of the United States \"to cause to be collected and reported to\r\nthe Senate at the commencement of the next stated session of Congress\r\nthe most authentic information which can be obtained of the number and\r\nnames of the American citizens who have been killed or robbed while\r\nengaged in the fur trade or the inland trade to Mexico since the late\r\nwar with Great Britain, the amount of the robberies committed, and at\r\nwhat places and by what tribes; also the number of persons who annually\r\nengage in the fur trade and inland trade to Mexico, the amount of\r\ncapital employed, and the annual amount of the proceeds in furs, robes,\r\npeltries, money, etc.; also the disadvantages, if any, which these\r\nbranches of trade labor under, and the means for their relief and\r\nprotection.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 10, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n3d March, 1831, I herewith transmit a report of the Secretary of War \"of\r\nthe survey of the Savannah and Tennessee rivers made in 1828.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of State, containing the\r\ninformation and documents[13] called for by a resolution of the Senate\r\nof the 9th instant.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Dispatch of Mr. Gallatin transmitting the convention of\r\nSeptember 29, 1827, and report of an exploring survey from the Sebois\r\nRiver to the head waters of the Penobscot River, made in 1829.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 15, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBeing more and more convinced that the destiny of the Indians within the\r\nsettled portion of the United States depends upon their entire and\r\nspeedy migration to the country west of the Mississippi set apart for\r\ntheir permanent residence, I am anxious that all the arrangements\r\nnecessary to the complete execution of the plan of removal and to the\r\nultimate security and improvement of the Indians should be made without\r\nfurther delay. Those who have already removed and are removing are\r\nsufficiently numerous to engage the serious attention of the Government,\r\nand it is due not less to them than to the obligation which the nation\r\nhas assumed that every reasonable step should be taken to fulfill the\r\nexpectations that have been held out to them. Many of those who yet\r\nremain will no doubt within a short period become sensible that the\r\ncourse recommended is the only one which promises stability or\r\nimprovement, and it is to be hoped that all of them will realize this\r\ntruth and unite with their brethren beyond the Mississippi. Should they\r\ndo so, there would then be no question of jurisdiction to prevent the\r\nGovernment from exercising such a general control over their affairs as\r\nmay be essential to their interest and safety. Should any of them,\r\nhowever, repel the offer of removal, they are free to remain, but they\r\nmust remain with such privileges and disabilities as the respective\r\nStates within whose jurisdiction they live may prescribe.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, which presents a\r\ngeneral outline of the progress that has already been made in this work\r\nand of all that remains to be done. It will be perceived that much\r\ninformation is yet necessary for the faithful performance of the duties\r\nof the Government, without which it will be impossible to provide for\r\nthe execution of some of the existing stipulations, or make those\r\nprudential arrangements upon which the final success of the whole\r\nmovement, so far as relates to the Indians themselves, must depend.\r\n\r\nI recommend the subject to the attention of Congress in the hope that\r\nthe suggestions in this report may be found useful and that provision\r\nmay be made for the appointment of the commissioners therein referred to\r\nand for vesting them with such authority as may be necessary to the\r\nsatisfactory performance of the important duties proposed to be\r\nintrusted to them.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 20, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate._\r\n\r\nI nominate Charles Ellery to be a lieutenant in the Navy of the United\r\nStates, to take rank as if appointed the 29th of April, 1826.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the above nomination the President submits to the\r\nSenate the following facts:\r\n\r\nCharles Ellery was originally appointed a lieutenant in the Navy the\r\n13th of January, 1825, and was dismissed from the service the 24th of\r\nNovember, 1830. The dismissal was in pursuance of the sentence of the\r\nsame court-martial which tried Master Commandant Clack in September,\r\n1830; but it is thought no technical objections to the legality of the\r\nproceedings can be found so well sustained as they were in the case of\r\nMaster Commandant Clack before the Senate at their last session, and it\r\nis supposed that Lieutenant Ellery has no claim for restoration to his\r\nformer rank except on the ground of great severity in the sentence,\r\nfounded on unfavorable impressions as to his conduct, which his prior\r\nand subsequent behavior, as manifested in the documents hereto annexed,\r\nprove to have been in some degree erroneous. The charges were\r\nintemperance and sleeping on his post. His departures from strict\r\ntemperance were only in a few instances, and seem to have arisen from\r\ndomestic calamity and never to have grown into a habit; and the only\r\ninstance testified to in support of the other charge seems now at least\r\ndoubtful, and if sustained at all to be imputable to the same cause.\r\n\r\nUnder these views of the case, which a charitable consideration of the\r\nproceedings and of his character as fully developed in the annexed\r\ndocuments appears fully to justify, his punishment ought, in my opinion,\r\nto be mitigated. He is therefore nominated so as to restore him to the\r\nservice, with loss of pay and rank for about the time elapsed since his\r\nlast dismission.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the court-martial and the testimonials referred to\r\nare inclosed, numbered from 1 to 10.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 24, 1832_.\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you, for your consideration and advice, a treaty of limits\r\nbetween the United States of America and the Republic of Mexico,\r\nconcluded at Mexico on the 12th day of January, 1828, and a\r\nsupplementary article

considerations which in his\r\nopinion render it proper that the United States should be represented by\r\na chargé d àffaires to the King of the Belgians at this time, I transmit\r\nherewith a report from the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of Congress the accompanying report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, showing the propriety of making some change by\r\nlaw in the duty on the red wines imported into the United States from\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nANDREW

1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n7th instant, requesting the President of the United States to inform

the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, containing the\r\ninformation called for by the resolution of the House of the 26th\r\nJanuary last, in

_consideration_ to be paid to Maine, and, if so,\r\nwhat consideration was proposed, so far as the same may not be\r\ninconsistent with the public interest,\" I transmit herewith a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 2, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 17th of the last\r\nmonth, requesting the President to obtain and communicate to it as soon\r\nas may be practicable information \"whether possession has been taken of\r\nany part of the territory of the United States on the Pacific Ocean by\r\nthe subjects of any foreign power, with any other information relative\r\nto the condition and character of the said territory,\" I transmit\r\nherewith reports from the Secretaries of the State and Navy Departments,\r\nfrom which it will appear that there is no satisfactory information on\r\nthe subject now in possession of the Executive, and that none is likely\r\nto be obtained but at an expense which can not be incurred without the\r\nauthority of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 4, 1832_.\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to Congress a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nshowing the circumstances under which refuge was given on board the\r\nUnited States ship _St. Louis_, Captain Sloat, to the vice-president of\r\nthe Republic of Peru and to General Miller, and the expense thereby\r\nincurred by Captain Sloat, for the payment of which there is no fund\r\napplicable to the case.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress that provision be made for this and similar\r\ncases that may occur in future.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 4, 1832_.\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith to the consideration of Congress a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, showing the necessity of providing additional\r\naccommodations for the Patent Office, and proposing the purchase of a\r\nsuitable building, which has been offered to the Government for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 4, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, made in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the Senate which requests the\r\nPresident to communicate to the Senate, if not incompatible with the\r\npublic interest, that portion of the correspondence between Mr. McLane,\r\nwhile minister at London, and the Secretary of State, and also between\r\nour said minister and the British Government, respecting the colonial\r\ntrade, which may not have been communicated with his message to Congress\r\nof the 3d January, 1831.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 6, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI nominate William P. Zantzinger, of Pennsylvania, to be a purser in the\r\nNavy of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn submitting the above nomination it is deemed proper to give some\r\ndetail of the peculiar circumstances of the case. Mr. Zantzinger was\r\nformerly a purser, and after a trial by a court-martial in January,\r\n1830, was dismissed from the naval service. The record is inclosed,\r\nmarked A. In July, 1830, verbally, afterwards in writing early in 1831,\r\nhe applied for restoration to his former situation and date on the\r\nassumed ground that the proceedings in his trial were illegal and void,\r\nand he fortified himself by the many numerous certificates and opinions\r\nherewith forwarded, marked B.\r\n\r\nThese have been carefully examined, and though failing to convince me of\r\nthe correctness of his position in respect to the nullity of those\r\nproceedings, I am satisfied that under all the circumstances of the case\r\na mitigation of his sentence can be justified on both public and\r\npersonal grounds.\r\n\r\nWith the loss of his former date and of his pay since his dismission, I\r\nhave therefore submitted his nomination to take effect like an original\r\nentry into the service, only from its confirmation by the Senate. There\r\nis now one vacancy in the corps of pursers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 9, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution requesting the President to transmit\r\nto the Senate \"Lord Aberdeen's letter in answer to Mr. Barbour's of the\r\n27th November, 1828, and also so much of a letter of the 22d April,\r\n1831, from Mr. McLane to Mr. Van Buren as relates to the proposed duty\r\non cotton,\" I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State,\r\ncommunicating copies of the letters referred to.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 13, 1832_.\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nApproving the suggestions expressed by the Secretary of State in regard\r\nto the propriety of exempting Portuguese vessels entering the ports of\r\nthe United States from the payment of the duties on tonnage, in\r\nconsequence of a like exemption being extended to those of the United\r\nStates, I transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, his\r\nletter on the subject.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 18, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report[14] from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ncontaining the information called for by the resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe 3d instant.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Relating to trade with the European possessions of Great\r\nBritain for the year ending September 30, 1831.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 19, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith printed copies of each of the treaties between the\r\nUnited States and the Indian tribes that have been ratified during the\r\npresent session of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 20, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 9th instant,\r\nrequesting the President \"to communicate to the Senate all the\r\ninstructions given by this Government to our ministers to Great Britain\r\nand all the correspondence of our ministers on the subject of the\r\ncolonial and West India trade since the 3d of March, 1825, not\r\nheretofore communicated, so far as the public interest will, in his\r\njudgment, permit,\" I transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of\r\nState, containing the information required.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 23, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, suggesting the propriety of passing a law making\r\nit criminal within the limits of the United States to counterfeit the\r\ncurrent coin of any foreign nation.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 23, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ncontaining the information called for by the resolution of the 26th of\r\nMarch last, in which the President is requested to communicate to the\r\nSenate--\r\n\r\nFirst.

The letters expressing this\r\nrequest are herewith respectfully inclosed for the consideration of the\r\nSenate.

Having considered it with that\r\nsolemn regard to the principles of the Constitution which the day was\r\ncalculated to inspire, and come to the conclusion that it ought not to\r\nbecome a law, I herewith return it to the Senate, in which it\r\noriginated, with my objections.\r\n\r\nA bank of the United States is in many respects convenient for the\r\nGovernment and useful to the people. Entertaining this opinion, and\r\ndeeply impressed with the belief that some of the powers and privileges\r\npossessed by the existing bank are unauthorized by the Constitution,\r\nsubversive of the rights of the States, and dangerous to the liberties\r\nof the people, I felt it my duty at an early period of my Administration\r\nto call the attention of Congress to the practicability of organizing an\r\ninstitution combining all its advantages and obviating these objections.\r\nI sincerely regret that in the act before me I can perceive none of\r\nthose modifications of the bank charter which are necessary, in my\r\nopinion, to make it compatible with justice, with sound policy, or with\r\nthe Constitution of our country.\r\n\r\nThe present corporate body, denominated the president, directors, and\r\ncompany of the Bank of the United States, will have existed at the time\r\nthis act is intended to take effect twenty years. It enjoys an exclusive\r\nprivilege of banking under the authority of the General Government, a\r\nmonopoly of its favor and support, and, as a necessary consequence,\r\nalmost a monopoly of the foreign and domestic exchange. The powers,\r\nprivileges, and favors bestowed upon it in the original charter, by\r\nincreasing the value of the stock far above its par value, operated as a\r\ngratuity of many millions to the stockholders.\r\n\r\nAn apology may be found for the failure to guard against this result in\r\nthe consideration that the effect of the original act of incorporation\r\ncould not be certainly foreseen at the time of its passage. The act\r\nbefore me proposes another gratuity to the holders of the same stock,\r\nand in many cases to the same men, of at least seven millions more. This\r\ndonation finds no apology in any uncertainty as to the effect of the\r\nact. On all hands it is conceded that its passage will increase at least\r\n20 or 30 per cent more the market price of the stock, subject to the\r\npayment of the annuity of $200,000 per year secured by the act, thus\r\nadding in a moment one-fourth to its par value. It is not our own\r\ncitizens only who are to receive the bounty of our Government. More than\r\neight millions of the stock of this bank are held by foreigners. By this\r\nact the American Republic proposes virtually to make them a present of\r\nsome millions of dollars. For these gratuities to foreigners and to some\r\nof our own opulent citizens the act secures no equivalent whatever. They\r\nare the certain gains of the present stockholders under the operation of\r\nthis act, after making full allowance for the payment of the bonus.\r\n\r\nEvery monopoly and all exclusive privileges are granted at the expense\r\nof the public, which ought to receive a fair equivalent. The many\r\nmillions which this act proposes to bestow on the stockholders of the\r\nexisting bank must come directly or indirectly out of the earnings of\r\nthe American people. It is due to them, therefore, if their Government\r\nsell monopolies and exclusive privileges, that they should at least\r\nexact for them as much as they are worth in open market. The value of\r\nthe monopoly in this case may be correctly ascertained. The twenty-eight\r\nmillions of stock would probably be at an advance of 50 per cent, and\r\ncommand in market at least $42,000,000, subject to the payment of the\r\npresent bonus. The present value of the monopoly, therefore, is\r\n$17,000,000, and this the act proposes to sell for three millions,\r\npayable in fifteen annual installments of $200,000 each.\r\n\r\nIt is not conceivable how the present stockholders can have any claim to\r\nthe special favor of the Government. The present corporation has enjoyed\r\nits monopoly during the period stipulated in the original contract. If\r\nwe must have such a corporation, why should not the Government sell out\r\nthe whole stock and thus secure to the people the full market value of\r\nthe privileges granted? Why should not Congress create and sell\r\ntwenty-eight millions of stock, incorporating the purchasers with all\r\nthe powers and privileges secured in this act and putting the premium\r\nupon the sales into the Treasury?\r\n\r\nBut this act does not permit competition in the purchase of this\r\nmonopoly. It seems to be predicated on the erroneous idea that the\r\npresent stockholders have a prescriptive right not only to the favor but\r\nto the bounty of Government. It appears that more than a fourth part of\r\nthe stock is held by foreigners and the residue is held by a few hundred\r\nof our own citizens, chiefly of the richest class. For their benefit\r\ndoes this act exclude the whole American people from competition in the\r\npurchase of this monopoly and dispose of it for many millions less than\r\nit is worth. This seems the less excusable because some of our citizens\r\nnot now stockholders petitioned that the door of competition might be\r\nopened, and offered to take a charter on terms much more favorable to\r\nthe Government and country.\r\n\r\nBut this proposition, although made by men whose aggregate wealth is\r\nbelieved to be equal to all the private stock in the existing bank, has\r\nbeen set aside, and the bounty of our Government is proposed to be again\r\nbestowed on the few who have been fortunate enough to secure the stock\r\nand at this moment wield the power of the existing institution. I can\r\nnot perceive the justice or policy of this course. If our Government\r\nmust sell monopolies, it would seem to be its duty to take nothing less\r\nthan their full value, and if gratuities must be made once in fifteen or\r\ntwenty years let them not be bestowed on the subjects of a foreign\r\ngovernment nor upon a designated and favored class of men in our own\r\ncountry. It is but justice and good policy, as far as the nature of the\r\ncase will admit, to confine our favors to our own fellow citizens, and\r\nlet each in his turn enjoy an opportunity to profit by our bounty. In\r\nthe bearings of the act before me upon these points I find ample reasons\r\nwhy it should not become a law.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged as an argument in favor of rechartering the present\r\nbank that the calling in its loans will produce great embarrassment and\r\ndistress. The time allowed to close its concerns is ample, and if it has\r\nbeen well managed its pressure will be light, and heavy only in case its\r\nmanagement has been bad. If, therefore, it shall produce distress, the\r\nfault will be its own, and it would furnish a reason against renewing a\r\npower which has been so obviously abused. But will there ever be a time\r\nwhen this reason will be less powerful? To acknowledge its force is to\r\nadmit that the bank ought to be perpetual, and as a consequence the\r\npresent stockholders and those inheriting their rights as successors be\r\nestablished a privileged order, clothed both with great political power\r\nand enjoying immense pecuniary advantages from their connection with the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe modifications of the existing charter proposed by this act are not\r\nsuch, in my view, as make it consistent with the rights of the States or\r\nthe liberties of the people. The qualification of the right of the bank\r\nto hold real estate, the limitation of its power to establish branches,\r\nand the power reserved to Congress to forbid the circulation of small\r\nnotes are restrictions comparatively of little value or importance. All\r\nthe objectionable principles of the existing corporation, and most of\r\nits odious features, are retained without alleviation.\r\n\r\nThe fourth section provides \"that the notes or bills of the said\r\ncorporation, although the same be, on the faces thereof, respectively\r\nmade payable at one place only, shall nevertheless be received by the\r\nsaid corporation at the bank or at any of the offices of discount and\r\ndeposit thereof if tendered in liquidation or payment of any balance or\r\nbalances due to said corporation or to such office of discount and\r\ndeposit from any other incorporated bank.\" This provision secures to the\r\nState banks a legal privilege in the Bank of the United States which is\r\nwithheld from all private citizens. If a State bank in Philadelphia owe\r\nthe Bank of the United States and have notes issued by the St. Louis\r\nbranch, it can pay the debt with those notes, but if a merchant,\r\nmechanic, or other private citizen be in like circumstances he can not\r\nby law pay his debt with those notes, but must sell them at a discount\r\nor send them to St. Louis to be cashed. This boon conceded to the State\r\nbanks, though not unjust in itself, is most odious because it does not\r\nmeasure out equal justice to the high and the low, the rich and the\r\npoor. To the extent of its practical effect it is a bond of union among\r\nthe banking establishments of the nation, erecting them into an interest\r\nseparate from that of the people, and its necessary tendency is to unite\r\nthe Bank of the United States and the State banks in any measure which\r\nmay be thought conducive to their common interest.\r\n\r\nThe ninth section of the act recognizes principles of worse tendency\r\nthan any provision of the present charter.\r\n\r\nIt enacts that \"the cashier of the bank shall annually report to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury the names of all stockholders who are not\r\nresident citizens of the United States, and on the application of the\r\ntreasurer of any State shall make out and transmit to such treasurer a\r\nlist of stockholders residing in or citizens of such State, with the\r\namount of stock owned by each.\" Although this provision, taken in\r\nconnection with a decision of the Supreme Court, surrenders, by its\r\nsilence, the right of the States to tax the banking institutions created\r\nby this corporation under the name of branches throughout the Union, it\r\nis evidently intended to be construed as a concession of their right to\r\ntax that portion of the stock which may be held by their own citizens\r\nand residents. In this light, if the act becomes a law, it will be\r\nunderstood by the States, who will probably proceed to levy a tax equal\r\nto that paid upon the stock of banks incorporated by themselves. In some\r\nStates that tax is now 1 per cent, either on the capital or on the\r\nshares, and that may be assumed as the amount which all citizen or\r\nresident stockholders would be taxed under the operation of this act. As\r\nit is only the stock _held_ in the States and not that _employed_ within\r\nthem which would be subject to taxation, and as the names of foreign\r\nstockholders are not to be reported to the treasurers of the States, it\r\nis obvious that the stock held by them will be exempt from this burden.\r\nTheir annual profits will therefore be 1 per cent more than the citizen\r\nstockholders, and as the annual dividends of the bank may be safely\r\nestimated at 7 per cent, the stock will be worth 10 or 15 per cent more\r\nto foreigners than to citizens of the United States. To appreciate the\r\neffects which this state of things will produce, we must take a brief\r\nreview of the operations and present condition of the Bank of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBy documents submitted to Congress at the present session it appears\r\nthat on the 1st of January, 1832, of the twenty-eight millions of\r\nprivate stock in the corporation, $8,405,500 were held by foreigners,\r\nmostly of Great Britain. The amount of stock held in the nine Western\r\nand Southwestern States is $140,200, and in the four Southern States is\r\n$5,623,100, and in the Middle and Eastern States is about $13,522,000.\r\nThe profits of the bank in 1831, as shown in a statement to Congress,\r\nwere about $3,455,598; of this there accrued in the nine Western States\r\nabout $1,640,048; in the four Southern States about $352,507, and in the\r\nMiddle and Eastern States about $1,463,041. As little stock is held in\r\nthe West, it is obvious that the debt of the people in that section to\r\nthe bank is principally a debt to the Eastern and foreign stockholders;\r\nthat the interest they pay upon it is carried into the Eastern States\r\nand into Europe, and that it is a burden upon their industry and a drain\r\nof their currency, which no country can bear without inconvenience and\r\noccasional distress. To meet this burden and equalize the exchange\r\noperations of the bank, the amount of specie drawn from those States\r\nthrough its branches within the last two years, as shown by its official\r\nreports, was about $6,000,000. More than half a million of this amount\r\ndoes not stop in the Eastern States, but passes on to Europe to pay the\r\ndividends of the foreign stockholders. In the principle of taxation\r\nrecognized by this act the Western States find no adequate compensation\r\nfor this perpetual burden on their industry and drain of their currency.\r\nThe branch bank at Mobile made last year $95,140, yet under the\r\nprovisions of this act the State of Alabama can raise no revenue from\r\nthese profitable operations, because not a share of the stock is held by\r\nany of her citizens. Mississippi and Missouri are in the same condition\r\nin relation to the branches at Natchez and St. Louis, and such, in a\r\ngreater or less degree, is the condition of every Western State. The\r\ntendency of the plan of taxation which this act proposes will be to\r\nplace the whole United States in the same relation to foreign countries\r\nwhich the Western States now bear to the Eastern. When by a tax on\r\nresident stockholders the stock of this bank is made worth 10 or 15 per\r\ncent more to foreigners than to residents, most of it will inevitably\r\nleave the country.\r\n\r\nThus will this provision in its practical effect deprive the Eastern as\r\nwell as the Southern and Western States of the means of raising a\r\nrevenue from the extension of business and great profits of this\r\ninstitution. It will make the American people debtors to aliens in\r\nnearly the whole amount due to this bank, and send across the Atlantic\r\nfrom two to five millions of specie every year to pay the bank\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\nIn another of its bearings this provision is fraught with danger. Of the\r\ntwenty-five directors of this bank five are chosen by the Government and\r\ntwenty by the citizen stockholders. From all voice in these elections\r\nthe foreign stockholders are excluded by the charter. In proportion,\r\ntherefore, as the stock is transferred to foreign holders the extent of\r\nsuffrage in the choice of directors is curtailed. Already is almost a\r\nthird of the stock in foreign hands and not represented in elections. It\r\nis constantly passing out of the country, and this act will accelerate\r\nits departure. The entire control of the institution would necessarily\r\nfall into the hands of a few citizen stockholders, and the ease with\r\nwhich the object would be accomplished would be a temptation to\r\ndesigning men to secure that control in their own hands by monopolizing\r\nthe remaining stock. There is danger that a president and directors\r\nwould then be able to elect themselves from year to year, and without\r\nresponsibility or control manage the whole concerns of the bank during\r\nthe existence of its charter. It is easy to conceive that great evils to\r\nour country and its institutions might flow from such a concentration of\r\npower in the hands of a few men irresponsible to the people.\r\n\r\nIs there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its\r\nnature has so little to bind it to our country? The president of the\r\nbank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance.\r\nShould its influence become concentered, as it may under the operation\r\nof such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose\r\ninterests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will\r\nthere not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace\r\nand for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be\r\ngreat whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were\r\nregularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by\r\nthemselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to\r\ninfluence elections or control the affairs of the nation. But if any\r\nprivate citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its\r\npowers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it can not be doubted\r\nthat he would be made to feel its influence.\r\n\r\nShould the stock of the bank principally pass into the hands of the\r\nsubjects of a foreign country, and we should unfortunately become\r\ninvolved in a war with that country, what would be our condition? Of the\r\ncourse which would be pursued by a bank almost wholly owned by the\r\nsubjects of a foreign power, and managed by those whose interests, if\r\nnot affections, would run in the same direction there can be no doubt.\r\nAll its operations within would be in aid of the hostile fleets and\r\narmies without. Controlling our currency, receiving our public moneys,\r\nand holding thousands of our citizens in dependence, it would be more\r\nformidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIf we must have a bank with private stockholders, every consideration of\r\nsound policy and every impulse of American feeling admonishes that it\r\nshould be _purely American_. Its stockholders should be composed\r\nexclusively of our own citizens, who at least ought to be friendly to\r\nour Government and willing to support it in times of difficulty and\r\ndanger. So abundant is domestic capital that competition in subscribing\r\nfor the stock of local banks has recently led almost to riots. To a bank\r\nexclusively of American stockholders, possessing the powers and\r\nprivileges granted by this act, subscriptions for $200,000,000 could be\r\nreadily obtained. Instead of sending abroad the stock of the bank in\r\nwhich the Government must deposit its funds and on which it must rely to\r\nsustain its credit in times of emergency, it would rather seem to be\r\nexpedient to prohibit its sale to aliens under penalty of absolute\r\nforfeiture.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained by the advocates of the bank that its constitutionality\r\nin all its features ought to be considered as settled by precedent and\r\nby the decision of the Supreme Court. To this conclusion I can not\r\nassent. Mere precedent is a dangerous source of authority, and should\r\nnot be regarded as deciding questions of constitutional power except\r\nwhere the acquiescence of the people and the States can be considered as\r\nwell settled. So far from this being the case on this subject, an\r\nargument against the bank might be based on precedent. One Congress, in\r\n1791, decided in favor of a bank; another, in 1811, decided against it.\r\nOne Congress, in 1815, decided against a bank; another, in 1816, decided\r\nin its favor. Prior to the present Congress, therefore, the precedents\r\ndrawn from that source were equal. If we resort to the States, the\r\nexpressions of legislative, judicial, and executive opinions against the\r\nbank have been probably to those in its favor as 4 to 1. There is\r\nnothing in precedent, therefore, which, if its authority were admitted,\r\nought to weigh in favor of the act before me.\r\n\r\nIf the opinion of the Supreme Court covered the whole ground of this\r\nact, it ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this\r\nGovernment. The Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each for\r\nitself be guided by its own opinion of the Constitution. Each public\r\nofficer who takes an oath to support the Constitution swears that he\r\nwill support it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by\r\nothers. It is as much the duty of the House of Representatives, of the\r\nSenate, and of the President to decide upon the constitutionality of any\r\nbill or resolution which may be presented to them for passage or\r\napproval as it is of the supreme judges when it may be brought before\r\nthem for judicial decision. The opinion of the judges has no more\r\nauthority over Congress than the opinion of Congress has over the\r\njudges, and on that point the President is independent of both. The\r\nauthority of the Supreme Court must not, therefore, be permitted to\r\ncontrol the Congress or the Executive when acting in their legislative\r\ncapacities, but to have only such influence as the force of their\r\nreasoning may deserve.\r\n\r\nBut in the case relied upon the Supreme Court have not decided that all\r\nthe features of this corporation are compatible with the Constitution.\r\nIt is true that the court have said that the law incorporating the bank\r\nis a constitutional exercise of power by Congress; but taking into view\r\nthe whole opinion of the court and the reasoning by which they have come\r\nto that conclusion, I understand them to have decided that inasmuch as a\r\nbank is an appropriate means for carrying into effect the enumerated\r\npowers of the General Government, therefore the law incorporating it is\r\nin accordance with that provision of the Constitution which declares\r\nthat Congress shall have power \"to make all laws which shall be\r\nnecessary and proper for carrying those powers into execution.\" Having\r\nsatisfied themselves that the word \"_necessary_\" in the Constitution\r\nmeans \"_needful,\" \"requisite,\" \"essential,\" \"conducive to_,\" and that \"a\r\nbank\" is a convenient, a useful, and essential instrument in the\r\nprosecution of the Government's \"fiscal operations,\" they conclude that\r\nto \"use one must be within the discretion of Congress\" and that \"the act\r\nto incorporate the Bank of the United States is a law made in pursuance\r\nof the Constitution;\" \"but,\" say they, \"_where the law is not prohibited\r\nand is really calculated to effect any of the objects intrusted to the\r\nGovernment, to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its\r\nnecessity would be to pass the line which circumscribes the judicial\r\ndepartment and to tread on legislative ground_.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle here affirmed is that the \"degree of its necessity,\"\r\ninvolving all the details of a banking institution, is a question\r\nexclusively for legislative consideration. A bank is constitutional, but\r\nit is the province of the Legislature to determine whether this or that\r\nparticular power, privilege, or exemption is \"necessary and proper\" to\r\nenable the bank to discharge its duties to the Government, and from\r\ntheir decision there is no appeal to the courts of justice. Under the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court, therefore, it is the exclusive province\r\nof Congress and the President to decide whether the particular features\r\nof this act are _necessary_ and _proper_ in order to enable the bank to\r\nperform conveniently and efficiently the public duties assigned to it as\r\na fiscal agent, and therefore constitutional, or _unnecessary_ and\r\n_improper_, and therefore unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nWithout commenting on the general principle affirmed by the Supreme\r\nCourt, let us examine the details of this act in accordance with the\r\nrule of legislative action which they have laid down. It will be found\r\nthat many of the powers and privileges conferred on it can not be\r\nsupposed necessary for the purpose for which it is proposed to be\r\ncreated, and are not, therefore, means necessary to attain the end in\r\nview, and consequently not justified by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe original act of incorporation, section 21, enacts \"that no other\r\nbank shall be established by any future law of the United States during\r\nthe continuance of the corporation hereby created, for which the faith\r\nof the United States is hereby pledged: _Provided_, Congress may renew\r\nexisting charters for banks within the District of Columbia not\r\nincreasing the capital thereof, and may also establish any other bank or\r\nbanks in said District with capitals not exceeding in the whole\r\n$6,000,000 if they shall deem it expedient.\" This provision is continued\r\nin force by the act before me fifteen years from the 3d of March, 1836.\r\n\r\nIf Congress possessed the power to establish one bank, they had power to\r\nestablish more than one if in their opinion two or more banks had been\r\n\"necessary\" to facilitate the execution of the powers delegated to them\r\nin the Constitution. If they possessed the power to establish a second\r\nbank, it was a power derived from the Constitution to be exercised from\r\ntime to time, and at any time when the interests of the country or the\r\nemergencies of the Government might make it expedient. It was possessed\r\nby one Congress as well as another, and by all Congresses alike, and\r\nalike at every session. But the Congress of 1816 have taken it away from\r\ntheir successors for twenty years, and the Congress of 1832 proposes to\r\nabolish it for fifteen years more. It can not be \"_necessary_\" or\r\n\"_proper_\" for Congress to barter away or divest themselves of any of\r\nthe powers vested in them by the Constitution to be exercised for the\r\npublic good. It is not \"_necessary_\" to the efficiency of the bank, nor\r\nis it \"_proper_\" in relation to themselves and their successors. They\r\nmay _properly_ use the discretion vested in them, but they may not limit\r\nthe discretion of their successors. This restriction on themselves and\r\ngrant of a monopoly to the bank is therefore unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIn another point of view this provision is a palpable attempt to amend\r\nthe Constitution by an act of legislation. The Constitution declares\r\nthat \"the Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in\r\nall cases whatsoever\" over the District of Columbia. Its constitutional\r\npower, therefore, to establish banks in the District of Columbia and\r\nincrease their capital at will is unlimited and uncontrollable by any\r\nother power than that which gave authority to the Constitution. Yet this\r\nact declares that Congress shall _not_ increase the capital of existing\r\nbanks, nor create other banks with capitals exceeding in the whole\r\n$6,000,000. The Constitution declares that Congress _shall_ have power\r\nto exercise exclusive legislation over this District \"_in all cases\r\nwhatsoever_,\" and this act declares they shall not. Which is the supreme\r\nlaw of the land? This provision can not be \"_necessary_\" or \"_proper_\"\r\nor _constitutional_ unless the absurdity be admitted that whenever it be\r\n\"necessary and proper\" in the opinion of Congress they have a right to\r\nbarter away one portion of the powers vested in them by the Constitution\r\nas a means of executing the rest.\r\n\r\nOn two subjects only does the Constitution recognize in Congress the\r\npower to grant exclusive privileges or monopolies. It declares that\r\n\"Congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful\r\narts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the\r\nexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" Out of\r\nthis express delegation of power have grown our laws of patents and\r\ncopyrights. As the Constitution expressly delegates to Congress the\r\npower to grant exclusive privileges in these cases as the means of\r\nexecuting the substantive power \"to promote the progress of science and\r\nuseful arts,\" it is consistent with the fair rules of construction to\r\nconclude that such a power was not intended to be granted as a means of\r\naccomplishing any other end. On every other subject which comes within\r\nthe scope of Congressional power there is an ever-living discretion in\r\nthe use of proper means, which can not be restricted or abolished\r\nwithout an amendment of the Constitution. Every act of Congress,\r\ntherefore, which attempts by grants of monopolies or sale of exclusive\r\nprivileges for a limited time, or a time without limit, to restrict or\r\nextinguish its own discretion in the choice of means to execute its\r\ndelegated powers is equivalent to a legislative amendment of the\r\nConstitution, and palpably unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThis act authorizes and encourages transfers of its stock to foreigners\r\nand grants them an exemption from all State and national taxation. So\r\nfar from being \"_necessary and proper_\" that the bank should possess\r\nthis power to make it a safe and efficient agent of the Government in\r\nits fiscal operations, it is calculated to convert the Bank of the\r\nUnited States into a foreign bank, to impoverish our people in time of\r\npeace, to disseminate a foreign influence through every section of the\r\nRepublic, and in war to endanger our independence.\r\n\r\nThe several States reserved the power at the formation of the\r\nConstitution to regulate and control titles and transfers of real\r\nproperty, and most, if not all, of them have laws disqualifying aliens\r\nfrom acquiring or holding lands within their limits. But this act, in\r\ndisregard of the undoubted right of the States to prescribe such\r\ndisqualifications, gives to aliens stockholders in this bank an interest\r\nand title, as members of the corporation, to all the real property it\r\nmay acquire within any of the States of this Union. This privilege\r\ngranted to aliens is not \"_necessary_\" to enable the bank to perform its\r\npublic duties, nor in any sense \"_proper_\" because it is vitally\r\nsubversive of the rights of the States.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States have no constitutional power to\r\npurchase lands within the States except \"for the erection of forts,\r\nmagazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings,\" and even\r\nfor these objects only \"by the consent of the legislature of the State\r\nin which the same shall be.\" By making themselves stockholders in the\r\nbank and granting to the corporation the power to purchase lands for\r\nother purposes they assume a power not granted in the Constitution and\r\ngrant to others what they do not themselves possess. It is not\r\n_necessary_ to the receiving, safe-keeping, or transmission of the funds\r\nof the Government that the bank should possess this power, and it is not\r\n_proper_ that Congress should thus enlarge the powers delegated to them\r\nin the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe old Bank of the United States possessed a capital of only\r\n$11,000,000, which was found fully sufficient to enable it with dispatch\r\nand safety to perform all the functions required of it by the\r\nGovernment. The capital of the present bank is $35,000,000--at least\r\ntwenty-four more than experience has proved to be _necessary_ to enable\r\na bank to perform its public functions. The public debt which existed\r\nduring the period of the old bank and on the establishment of the new\r\nhas been nearly paid off, and our revenue will soon be reduced. This\r\nincrease of capital is therefore not for public but for private\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe Government is the only \"_proper_\" judge where its agents should\r\nreside and keep their offices, because it best knows where their\r\npresence will be \"_necessary_.\" It can not, therefore, be \"_necessary_\"\r\nor \"_proper_\" to authorize the bank to locate branches where it pleases\r\nto perform the public service, without consulting the Government, and\r\ncontrary to its will. The principle laid down by the Supreme Court\r\nconcedes that Congress can not establish a bank for purposes of private\r\nspeculation and gain, but only as a means of executing the delegated\r\npowers of the General Government. By the same principle a branch bank\r\ncan not constitutionally be established for other than public purposes.\r\nThe power which this act gives to establish two branches in any State,\r\nwithout the injunction or request of the Government and for other than\r\npublic purposes, is not \"_necessary_\" to the due _execution_ of the\r\npowers delegated to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe bonus which is exacted from the bank is a confession upon the face\r\nof the act that the powers granted by it are greater than are\r\n\"_necessary_\" to its character of a fiscal agent. The Government does\r\nnot tax its officers and agents for the privilege of serving it. The\r\nbonus of a million and a half required by the original charter and that\r\nof three millions proposed by this act are not exacted for the privilege\r\nof giving \"the necessary facilities for transferring the public funds\r\nfrom place to place within the United States or the Territories thereof,\r\nand for distributing the same in payment of the public creditors without\r\ncharging commission or claiming allowance on account of the difference\r\nof exchange,\" as required by the act of incorporation, but for something\r\nmore beneficial to the stockholders. The original act declares that it\r\n(the bonus) is granted \"in consideration of the exclusive privileges and\r\nbenefits conferred by this act upon the said bank,\" and the act before\r\nme declares it to be \"in consideration of the exclusive benefits and\r\nprivileges continued by this act to the said corporation for fifteen\r\nyears, as aforesaid.\" It is therefore for \"exclusive privileges and\r\nbenefits\" conferred for their own use and emolument, and not for the\r\nadvantage of the Government, that a bonus is exacted. These surplus\r\npowers for which the bank is required to pay can not surely be\r\n\"_necessary_\" to make it the fiscal agent of the Treasury. If they were,\r\nthe exaction of a bonus for them would not be \"_proper_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is maintained by some that the bank is a means of executing the\r\nconstitutional power \"to coin money and regulate the value thereof.\"\r\nCongress have established a mint to coin money and passed laws to\r\nregulate the value thereof. The money so coined, with its value so\r\nregulated, and such foreign coins as Congress may adopt are the only\r\ncurrency known to the Constitution. But if they have other power to\r\nregulate the currency, it was conferred to be exercised by themselves,\r\nand not to be transferred to a corporation. If the bank be established\r\nfor that purpose, with a charter unalterable without its consent,\r\nCongress have parted with their power for a term of years, during which\r\nthe Constitution is a dead letter. It is neither necessary nor proper to\r\ntransfer its legislative power to such a bank, and therefore\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nBy its silence, considered in connection with the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court in the case of McCulloch against the State of Maryland,\r\nthis act takes from the States the power to tax a portion of the banking\r\nbusiness carried on within their limits, in subversion of one of the\r\nstrongest barriers which secured them against Federal encroachments.\r\nBanking, like farming, manufacturing, or any other occupation or\r\nprofession, is _a business_, the right to follow which is not originally\r\nderived from the laws. Every citizen and every company of citizens in\r\nall of our States possessed the right until the State legislatures\r\ndeemed it good policy to prohibit private banking by law. If the\r\nprohibitory State laws were now repealed, every citizen would again\r\npossess the right. The State banks are a qualified restoration of the\r\nright which has been taken away by the laws against banking, guarded by\r\nsuch provisions and limitations as in the opinion of the State\r\nlegislatures the public interest requires. These corporations, unless\r\nthere be an exemption in their charter, are, like private bankers and\r\nbanking companies, subject to State taxation. The manner in which these\r\ntaxes shall be laid depends wholly on legislative discretion. It may be\r\nupon the bank, upon the stock, upon the profits, or in any other mode\r\nwhich the sovereign power shall will.\r\n\r\nUpon the formation of the Constitution the States guarded their taxing\r\npower with peculiar jealousy. They surrendered it only as it regards\r\nimports and exports. In relation to every other object within their\r\njurisdiction, whether persons, property, business, or professions, it\r\nwas secured in as ample a manner as it was before possessed. All\r\npersons, though United States officers, are liable to a poll tax by the\r\nStates within which they reside. The lands of the United States are\r\nliable to the usual land tax, except in the new States, from whom\r\nagreements that they will not tax unsold lands are exacted when they are\r\nadmitted into the Union. Horses, wagons, any beasts or vehicles, tools,\r\nor property belonging to private citizens, though employed in the\r\nservice of the United States, are subject to State taxation. Every\r\nprivate business, whether carried on by an officer of the General\r\nGovernment or not, whether it be mixed with public concerns or not, even\r\nif it be carried on by the Government of the United States itself,\r\nseparately or in partnership, falls within the scope of the taxing power\r\nof the State. Nothing comes more fully within it than banks and the\r\nbusiness of banking, by whomsoever instituted and carried on. Over this\r\nwhole subject-matter it is just as absolute, unlimited, and\r\nuncontrollable as if the Constitution had never been adopted, because in\r\nthe formation of that instrument it was reserved without qualification.\r\n\r\nThe principle is conceded that the States can not rightfully tax the\r\noperations of the General Government. They can not tax the money of the\r\nGovernment deposited in the State banks, nor the agency of those banks\r\nin remitting it; but will any man maintain that their mere selection to\r\nperform this public service for the General Government would exempt the\r\nState banks and their ordinary business from State taxation? Had the\r\nUnited States, instead of establishing a bank at Philadelphia, employed\r\na private banker to keep and transmit their funds, would it have\r\ndeprived Pennsylvania of the right to tax his bank and his usual banking\r\noperations? It will not be pretended. Upon what principle, then, are the\r\nbanking establishments of the Bank of the United States and their usual\r\nbanking operations to be exempted from taxation? It is not their public\r\nagency or the deposits of the Government which the States claim a right\r\nto tax, but their banks and their banking powers, instituted and\r\nexercised within State jurisdiction for their private emolument--those\r\npowers and privileges for which they pay a bonus, and which the States\r\ntax in their own banks. The exercise of these powers within a State, no\r\nmatter by whom or under what authority, whether by private citizens in\r\ntheir original right, by corporate bodies created by the States, by\r\nforeigners or the agents of foreign governments located within their\r\nlimits, forms a legitimate object of State taxation. From this and like\r\nsources, from the persons, property, and business that are found\r\nresiding, located, or carried on under their jurisdiction, must the\r\nStates, since the surrender of their right to raise a revenue from\r\nimports and exports, draw all the money necessary for the support of\r\ntheir governments and the maintenance of their independence. There is no\r\nmore appropriate subject of taxation than banks, banking, and bank\r\nstocks, and none to which the States ought more pertinaciously to cling.\r\n\r\nIt can not be _necessary_ to the character of the bank as a fiscal agent\r\nof the Government that its private business should be exempted from that\r\ntaxation to which all the State banks are liable, nor can I conceive it\r\n\"_proper_\" that the substantive and most essential powers reserved by\r\nthe States shall be thus attacked and annihilated as a means of\r\nexecuting the powers delegated to the General Government. It may be\r\nsafely assumed that none of those sages who had an agency in forming or\r\nadopting our Constitution ever imagined that any portion of the taxing\r\npower of the States not prohibited to them nor delegated to Congress was\r\nto be swept away and annihilated as a means of executing certain powers\r\ndelegated to Congress.\r\n\r\nIf our power over means is so absolute that the Supreme Court will not\r\ncall in question the constitutionality of an act of Congress the subject\r\nof which \"is not prohibited, and is really calculated to effect any of\r\nthe objects intrusted to the Government,\" although, as in the case\r\nbefore me, it takes away powers expressly granted to Congress and rights\r\nscrupulously reserved to the States, it becomes us to proceed in our\r\nlegislation with the utmost caution. Though not directly, our own powers\r\nand the rights of the States may be indirectly legislated away in the\r\nuse of means to execute substantive powers. We may not enact that\r\nCongress shall not have the power of exclusive legislation over the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, but we may pledge the faith of the United States\r\nthat as a means of executing other powers it shall not be exercised for\r\ntwenty years or forever. We may not pass an act prohibiting the States\r\nto tax the banking business carried on within their limits, but we may,\r\nas a means of executing our powers over other objects, place that\r\nbusiness in the hands of our agents and then declare it exempt from\r\nState taxation in their hands. Thus may our own powers and the rights of\r\nthe States, which we can not directly curtail or invade, be frittered\r\naway and extinguished in the use of means employed by us to execute\r\nother powers. That a bank of the United States, competent to all the\r\nduties which may be required by the Government, might be so organized as\r\nnot to infringe on our own delegated powers or the reserved rights of\r\nthe States I do not entertain a doubt. Had the Executive been called\r\nupon to furnish the project of such an institution, the duty would have\r\nbeen cheerfully performed. In the absence of such a call it was\r\nobviously proper that he should confine himself to pointing out those\r\nprominent features in the act; presented which in his opinion make it\r\nincompatible with the Constitution and sound policy. A general\r\ndiscussion will now take place, eliciting new light and settling\r\nimportant principles; and a new Congress, elected in the midst of such\r\ndiscussion, and furnishing an equal representation of the people\r\naccording to the last census, will bear to the Capitol the verdict of\r\npublic opinion, and, I doubt not, bring this important question to a\r\nsatisfactory result.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the bank comes forward and asks a renewal of\r\nits charter for a term of fifteen years upon conditions which not only\r\noperate as a gratuity to the stockholders of many millions of dollars,\r\nbut will sanction any abuses and legalize any encroachments.\r\n\r\nSuspicions are entertained and charges are made of gross abuse and\r\nviolation of its charter. An investigation unwillingly conceded and so\r\nrestricted in time as necessarily to make it incomplete and\r\nunsatisfactory discloses enough to excite suspicion and alarm. In the\r\npractices of the principal bank partially unveiled, in the absence of\r\nimportant witnesses, and in numerous charges confidently made and as yet\r\nwholly uninvestigated there was enough to induce a majority of the\r\ncommittee of investigation--a committee which was selected from the most\r\nable and honorable members of the House of Representatives--to recommend\r\na suspension of further action upon the bill and a prosecution of the\r\ninquiry. As the charter had yet four years to run, and as a renewal now\r\nwas not necessary to the successful prosecution of its business, it was\r\nto have been expected that the bank itself, conscious of its purity and\r\nproud of its character, would have withdrawn its application for the\r\npresent, and demanded the severest scrutiny into all its transactions.\r\nIn their declining to do so there seems to be an additional reason why\r\nthe functionaries of the Government should proceed with less haste and\r\nmore caution in the renewal of their monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe bank is professedly established as an agent of the executive branch\r\nof the Government, and its constitutionality is maintained on that\r\nground. Neither upon the propriety of present action nor upon the\r\nprovisions of this act was the Executive consulted. It has had no\r\nopportunity to say that it neither needs nor wants an agent clothed with\r\nsuch powers and favored by such exemptions. There is nothing in its\r\nlegitimate functions which makes it necessary or proper. Whatever\r\ninterest or influence, whether public or private, has given birth to\r\nthis act, it can not be found either in the wishes or necessities of the\r\nexecutive department, by which present action is deemed premature, and\r\nthe powers conferred upon its agent not only unnecessary, but dangerous\r\nto the Government and country.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts\r\nof government to their selfish purposes. Distinctions in society will\r\nalways exist under every just government. Equality of talents, of\r\neducation, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions. In\r\nthe full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior\r\nindustry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to\r\nprotection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural\r\nand just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles,\r\ngratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the\r\npotent more powerful, the humble members of society--the farmers,\r\nmechanics, and laborers--who have neither the time nor the means of\r\nsecuring like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the\r\ninjustice of their Government. There are no necessary evils in\r\ngovernment. Its evils exist only in its abuses. If it would confine\r\nitself to equal protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its\r\nfavors alike on the high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be\r\nan unqualified blessing. In the act before me there seems to be a wide\r\nand unnecessary departure from these just principles.\r\n\r\nNor is our Government to be maintained or our Union preserved by\r\ninvasions of the rights and powers of the several States. In thus\r\nattempting to make our General Government strong we make it weak. Its\r\ntrue strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as\r\npossible to themselves--in making itself felt, not in its power, but in\r\nits beneficence; not in its control, but in its protection; not in\r\nbinding the States more closely to the center, but leaving each to move\r\nunobstructed in its proper orbit.\r\n\r\nExperience should teach us wisdom. Most of the difficulties our\r\nGovernment now encounters and most of the dangers which impend over our\r\nUnion have sprung from an abandonment of the legitimate objects of\r\nGovernment by our national legislation, and the adoption of such\r\nprinciples as are embodied in this act. Many of our rich men have not\r\nbeen content with equal protection and equal benefits, but have besought\r\nus to make them richer by act of Congress. By attempting to gratify\r\ntheir desires we have in the results of our legislation arrayed section\r\nagainst section, interest against interest, and man against man, in a\r\nfearful commotion which threatens to shake the foundations of our Union.\r\nIt is time to pause in our career to review our principles, and if\r\npossible revive that devoted patriotism and spirit of compromise which\r\ndistinguished the sages of the Revolution and the fathers of our Union.\r\nIf we can not at once, in justice to interests vested under improvident\r\nlegislation, make our Government what it ought to be, we can at least\r\ntake a stand against all new grants of monopolies and exclusive\r\nprivileges, against any prostitution of our Government to the\r\nadvancement of the few at the expense of the many, and in favor of\r\ncompromise and gradual reform in our code of laws and system of\r\npolitical economy.\r\n\r\nI have now done my duty to my country. If sustained by my fellow\r\ncitizens, I shall be grateful and happy; if not, I shall find in the\r\nmotives which impel me ample grounds for contentment and peace. In the\r\ndifficulties which surround us and the dangers which threaten our\r\ninstitutions there is cause for neither dismay nor alarm. For relief and\r\ndeliverance let us firmly rely on that kind Providence which I am sure\r\nwatches with peculiar care over the destinies of our Republic, and on\r\nthe intelligence and wisdom of our countrymen. Through _His_ abundant\r\ngoodness and _their_ patriotic devotion our liberty and Union will be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n_December 4, 1832_.\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to congratulate you upon your return to the seat of\r\nGovernment for the purpose of discharging your duties to the people of\r\nthe United States. Although the pestilence which had traversed the Old\r\nWorld has entered our limits and extended its ravages over much of our\r\nland, it has pleased Almighty God to mitigate its severity and lessen\r\nthe number of its victims compared with those who have fallen in most\r\nother countries over which it has spread its terrors. Notwithstanding\r\nthis visitation, our country presents on every side marks of prosperity\r\nand happiness unequaled, perhaps, in any other portion of the world. If\r\nwe fully appreciate our comparative condition, existing causes of\r\ndiscontent will appear unworthy of attention, and, with hearts of\r\nthankfulness to that divine Being who has filled our cup of prosperity,\r\nwe shall feel our resolution strengthened to preserve and hand down to\r\nposterity that liberty and that union which we have received from our\r\nfathers, and which constitute the sources and the shield of all our\r\nblessings.\r\n\r\nThe relations of our country continue to present the same picture of\r\namicable intercourse that I had the satisfaction to hold up to your view\r\nat the opening of your last session. The same friendly professions, the\r\nsame desire to participate in our flourishing commerce, the same\r\ndisposition to refrain from injuries unintentionally offered, are, with\r\nfew exceptions, evinced by all nations with whom we have any\r\nintercourse. This desirable state of things may be mainly ascribed to\r\nour undeviating practice of the rule which has long guided our national\r\npolicy, to require no exclusive privileges in commerce and to grant\r\nnone. It is daily producing its beneficial effect in the respect shown\r\nto our flag, the protection of our citizens and their property abroad,\r\nand in the increase of our navigation and the extension of our\r\nmercantile operations. The returns which have been made out since we\r\nlast met will show an increase during the last preceding year of more\r\nthan 80,000 tons in our shipping and of near $40,000,000 in the\r\naggregate of our imports and exports.\r\n\r\nNor have we less reason to felicitate ourselves on the position of our\r\npolitical than of our commercial concerns. They remain in the state in\r\nwhich they were when I last addressed you--a state of prosperity and\r\npeace, the effect of a wise attention to the parting advice of the\r\nrevered Father of his Country on this subject, condensed into a maxim\r\nfor the use of posterity by one of his most distinguished successors--to\r\ncultivate free commerce and honest friendship with all nations, but to\r\nmake entangling alliances with none. A strict adherence to this policy\r\nhas kept us aloof from the perplexing questions that now agitate the\r\nEuropean world and have more than once deluged those countries with\r\nblood. Should those scenes unfortunately recur, the parties to the\r\ncontest may count on a faithful performance of the duties incumbent on\r\nus as a neutral nation, and our own citizens may equally rely on the\r\nfirm assertion of their neutral rights.\r\n\r\nWith the nation that was our earliest friend and ally in the infancy of\r\nour political existence the most friendly relations have subsisted\r\nthrough the late revolutions of its Government, and, from the events of\r\nthe last, promise a permanent duration. It has made an approximation in\r\nsome of its political institutions to our own, and raised a monarch to\r\nthe throne who preserves, it is said, a friendly recollection of the\r\nperiod during which he acquired among our citizens the high\r\nconsideration that could then have been produced by his personal\r\nqualifications alone.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with that nation is gradually assuming a mutually\r\nbeneficial character, and the adjustment of the claims of our citizens\r\nhas removed the only obstacle there was to an intercourse not only\r\nlucrative, but productive of literary and scientific improvement.\r\n\r\nFrom Great Britain I have the satisfaction to inform you that I continue\r\nto receive assurances of the most amicable disposition, which have on my\r\npart on all proper occasions been promptly and sincerely reciprocated.\r\nThe attention of that Government has latterly been so much engrossed by\r\nmatters of a deeply interesting domestic character that we could not\r\npress upon it the renewal of negotiations which had been unfortunately\r\nbroken off by the unexpected recall of our minister, who had commenced\r\nthem with some hopes of success. My great object was the settlement of\r\nquestions which, though now dormant, might hereafter be revived under\r\ncircumstances that would endanger the good understanding which it is the\r\ninterest of both parties to preserve inviolate, cemented as it is by a\r\ncommunity of language, manners, and social habits, and by the high\r\nobligations we owe to our British ancestors for many of our most\r\nvaluable institutions and for that system of representative government\r\nwhich has enabled us to preserve and improve them.\r\n\r\nThe question of our northeastern boundary still remains unsettled. In my\r\nlast annual message I explained to you the situation in which I found\r\nthat business on my coming into office, and the measures I thought it my\r\nduty to pursue for asserting the rights of the United States before the\r\nsovereign who had been chosen by my predecessor to determine the\r\nquestion, and also the manner in which he had disposed of it. A special\r\nmessage to the Senate in their executive capacity afterwards brought\r\nbefore them the question whether they would advise a submission to the\r\nopinion of the sovereign arbiter. That body having considered the award\r\nas not obligatory and advised me to open a further negotiation, the\r\nproposition was immediately made to the British Government, but the\r\ncircumstances to which I have alluded have hitherto prevented any answer\r\nbeing given to the overture. Early attention, however, has been promised\r\nto the subject, and every effort on my part will be made for a\r\nsatisfactory settlement of this question, interesting to the Union\r\ngenerally, and particularly so to one of its members.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens on Spain are not yet acknowledged. On a\r\ncloser investigation of them than appears to have heretofore taken place\r\nit was discovered that some of these demands, however strong they might\r\nbe upon the equity of that Government, were not such as could be made\r\nthe subject of national interference; and faithful to the principle of\r\nasking nothing but what was clearly right, additional instructions have\r\nbeen sent to modify our demands so as to embrace those only on which,\r\naccording to the laws of nations, we had a strict right to insist. An\r\ninevitable delay in procuring the documents necessary for this review of\r\nthe merits of these claims retarded this operation until an unfortunate\r\nmalady which has afflicted His Catholic Majesty prevented an examination\r\nof them. Being now for the first time presented in an unexceptionable\r\nform, it is confidently hoped that the application will be successful.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the application I directed to\r\nbe made for the delivery of a part of the archives of Florida, which had\r\nbeen carried to The Havannah, has produced a royal order for their\r\ndelivery, and that measures have been taken to procure its execution.\r\n\r\nBy the report of the Secretary of State communicated to you on the 25th\r\nJune last you were informed of the conditional reduction obtained by the\r\nminister of the United States at Madrid of the duties on tonnage levied\r\non American shipping in the ports of Spain. The condition of that\r\nreduction having been complied with on our part by the act passed the\r\n13th of July last, I have the satisfaction to inform you that our ships\r\nnow pay no higher nor other duties in the continental ports of Spain\r\nthan are levied on their national vessels.\r\n\r\nThe demands against Portugal for illegal captures in the blockade of\r\nTerceira have been allowed to the full amount of the accounts presented\r\nby the claimants, and payment was promised to be made in three\r\ninstallments. The first of these has been paid; the second, although\r\ndue, had not at the date of our last advices been received, owing, it\r\nwas alleged, to embarrassments in the finances consequent on the civil\r\nwar in which that nation is engaged.\r\n\r\nThe payments stipulated by the convention with Denmark have been\r\npunctually made, and the amount is ready for distribution among the\r\nclaimants as soon as the board, now sitting, shall have performed their\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nI regret that by the last advices from our chargé d'affaires at Naples\r\nthat Government had still delayed the satisfaction due to our citizens,\r\nbut at that date the effect of the last instructions was not known.\r\nDispatches from thence are hourly expected, and the result will be\r\ncommunicated to you without delay.\r\n\r\nWith the rest of Europe our relations, political and commercial, remain\r\nunchanged. Negotiations are going on to put on a permanent basis the\r\nliberal system of commerce now carried on between us and the Empire of\r\nRussia. The treaty concluded with Austria is executed by His Imperial\r\nMajesty with the most perfect good faith, and as we have no diplomatic\r\nagent at his Court he personally inquired into and corrected a\r\nproceeding of some of his subaltern officers to the injury of our consul\r\nin one of his ports.\r\n\r\nOur treaty with the Sublime Porte is producing its expected effects on\r\nour commerce. New markets are opening for our commodities and a more\r\nextensive range for the employment of our ships. A slight augmentation\r\nof the duties on our commerce, inconsistent with the spirit of the\r\ntreaty, had been imposed, but on the representation of our charge\r\nd'affaires it has been promptly withdrawn, and we now enjoy the trade\r\nand navigation of the Black Sea and of all the ports belonging to the\r\nTurkish Empire and Asia on the most perfect equality with all foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nI wish earnestly that in announcing to you the continuance of friendship\r\nand the increase of a profitable commercial intercourse with Mexico,\r\nwith Central America, and the States of the South I could accompany it\r\nwith the assurance that they all are blessed with that internal\r\ntranquillity and foreign peace which their heroic devotion to the cause\r\nof their independence merits. In Mexico a sanguinary struggle is now\r\ncarried on, which has caused some embarrassment to our commerce, but\r\nboth parties profess the most friendly disposition toward us. To the\r\ntermination of this contest we look for the establishment of that secure\r\nintercourse so necessary to nations whose territories are contiguous.\r\nHow important it will be to us we may calculate from the fact that even\r\nin this unfavorable state of things our maritime commerce has increased,\r\nand an internal trade by caravans from St. Louis to Santa Fe, under the\r\nprotection of escorts furnished by the Government, is carried on to\r\ngreat advantage and is daily increasing. The agents provided for by the\r\ntreaty, with this power to designate the boundaries which it\r\nestablished, have been named on our part, but one of the evils of the\r\ncivil war now raging there has been that the appointment of those with\r\nwhom they were to cooperate has not yet been announced to us.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Central America has expelled from its territory the\r\nparty which some time since disturbed its peace. Desirous of fostering a\r\nfavorable disposition toward us, which has on more than one occasion\r\nbeen evinced by this interesting country, I made a second attempt in\r\nthis year to establish a diplomatic intercourse with them; but the death\r\nof the distinguished citizen whom I had appointed for that purpose has\r\nretarded the execution of measures from which I hoped much advantage to\r\nour commerce. The union of the three States which formed the Republic of\r\nColombia has been dissolved, but they all, it is believed, consider\r\nthemselves as separately bound by the treaty which was made in their\r\nfederal capacity. The minister accredited to the federation continues in\r\nthat character near the Government of New Granada, and hopes were\r\nentertained that a new union would be formed between the separate\r\nStates, at least for the purposes of foreign intercourse. Our minister\r\nhas been instructed to use his good offices, whenever they shall be\r\ndesired, to produce the reunion so much to be wished for, the domestic\r\ntranquillity of the parties, and the security and facility of foreign\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nSome agitations naturally attendant on an infant reign have prevailed in\r\nthe Empire of Brazil, which have had the usual effect upon commercial\r\noperations, and while they suspended the consideration of claims created\r\non similar occasions, they have given rise to new complaints on the part\r\nof our citizens. A proper consideration for calamities and difficulties\r\nof this nature has made us less urgent and peremptory in our demands for\r\njustice than duty to our fellow-citizens would under other circumstances\r\nhave required. But their claims are not neglected, and will on all\r\nproper occasions be urged, and it is hoped with effect.\r\n\r\nI refrain from making any communication on the subject of our affairs\r\nwith Buenos Ayres, because the negotiation communicated to you in my\r\nlast annual message was at the date of our last advices still pending\r\nand in a state that would render a publication of the details\r\ninexpedient.\r\n\r\nA treaty of amity and commerce has been formed with the Republic of\r\nChili, which, if approved by the Senate, will be laid before you. That\r\nGovernment seems to be established, and at peace with its neighbors; and\r\nits ports being the resorts of our ships which are employed in the\r\nhighly important trade of the fisheries, this commercial convention can\r\nnot but be of great advantage to our fellow-citizens engaged in that\r\nperilous but profitable business.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with the neighboring State of Peru, owing to the onerous\r\nduties levied on our principal articles of export, has been on the\r\ndecline, and all endeavors to procure an alteration have hitherto proved\r\nfruitless. With Bolivia we have yet no diplomatic intercourse, and the\r\ncontinual contests carried on between it and Peru have made me defer\r\nuntil a more favorable period the appointment of any agent for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAn act of atrocious piracy having been committed on one of our trading\r\nships by the inhabitants of a settlement on the west coast of Sumatra, a\r\nfrigate was dispatched with orders to demand satisfaction for the injury\r\nif those who committed it should be found to be members of a regular\r\ngovernment, capable of maintaining the usual relations with foreign\r\nnations; but if, as it was supposed and as they proved to be, they were\r\na band of lawless pirates, to inflict such a chastisement as would deter\r\nthem and others from like aggressions. This last was done, and the\r\neffect has been an increased respect for our flag in those distant seas\r\nand additional security for our commerce.\r\n\r\nIn the view I have given of our connection with foreign powers allusions\r\nhave been made to their domestic disturbances or foreign wars, to their\r\nrevolutions or dissensions. It may be proper to observe that this is\r\ndone solely in cases where those events affect our political relations\r\nwith them, or to show their operation on our commerce. Further than this\r\nit is neither our policy nor our right to interfere. Our best wishes on\r\nall occasions, our good offices when required, will be afforded to\r\npromote the domestic tranquillity and foreign peace of all nations with\r\nwhom we have any intercourse. Any intervention in their affairs further\r\nthan this, even by the expression of an official opinion, is contrary to\r\nour principles of international policy, and will always be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe report which the Secretary of the Treasury will in due time lay\r\nbefore you will exhibit the national finances in a highly prosperous\r\nstate. Owing to the continued success of our commercial enterprise,\r\nwhich has enabled the merchants to fulfill their engagements with the\r\nGovernment, the receipts from customs during the year will exceed the\r\nestimate presented at the last session, and with the other means of the\r\nTreasury will prove fully adequate not only to meet the increased\r\nexpenditures resulting from the large appropriations made by Congress,\r\nbut to provide for the payment of all the public debt which is at\r\npresent redeemable. It is now estimated that the customs will yield to\r\nthe Treasury during the present year upward of $28,000,000. The public\r\nlands, however, have proved less productive than was anticipated, and\r\naccording to present information will not much exceed two millions. The\r\nexpenditures for all objects other than the public debt are estimated to\r\namount during the year to about sixteen millions and a half, while a\r\nstill larger sum, viz, $18,000,000, will have been applied to the\r\nprincipal and interest of the public debt.\r\n\r\nIt is expected, however, that in consequence of the reduced rates of\r\nduty which will take effect after the 3d of March next there will be a\r\nconsiderable falling off in the revenue from customs in the year 1833.\r\nIt will nevertheless be amply sufficient to provide for all the wants of\r\nthe public service, estimated even upon a liberal scale, and for the\r\nredemption and purchase of the remainder of the public debt. On the 1st\r\nof January next the entire public debt of the United States, funded and\r\nunfunded, will be reduced to within a fraction of $7,000,000, of which\r\n$2,227,363 are not of right redeemable until the 1st of January, 1834,\r\nand $4,735,296 not until the 2d of January, 1835. The commissioners of\r\nthe sinking funds, however, being invested with full authority to\r\npurchase the debt at the market price, and the means of the Treasury\r\nbeing ample, it may be hoped that the whole will be extinguished within\r\nthe year 1833.\r\n\r\nI can not too cordially congratulate Congress and my fellow-citizens on\r\nthe near approach of that memorable and happy event--the extinction of\r\nthe public debt of this great and free nation. Faithful to the wise and\r\npatriotic policy marked out by the legislation of the country for this\r\nobject, the present Administration has devoted to it all the means which\r\na flourishing commerce has supplied and a prudent economy preserved for\r\nthe public Treasury. Within the four years for which the people have\r\nconfided the Executive power to my charge $58,000,000 will have been\r\napplied to the payment of the public debt. That this has been\r\naccomplished without stinting the expenditures for all other proper\r\nobjects will be seen by referring to the liberal provision made during\r\nthe same period for the support and increase of our means of maritime\r\nand military defense, for internal improvements of a national character,\r\nfor the removal and preservation of the Indians, and, lastly, for the\r\ngallant veterans of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe final removal of this great burthen from our resources affords the\r\nmeans of further provision for all the objects of general welfare and\r\npublic defense which the Constitution authorizes, and presents the\r\noccasion for such further reduction in the revenue as may not be\r\nrequired for them. From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury it\r\nwill be seen that after the present year such a reduction may be made to\r\na considerable extent, and the subject is earnestly recommended to the\r\nconsideration of Congress in the hope that the combined wisdom of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people will devise such means of effecting that\r\nsalutary object as may remove those burthens which shall be found to\r\nfall unequally upon any and as may promote all the great interests of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nLong and patient reflection has strengthened the opinions I have\r\nheretofore expressed to Congress on this subject, and I deem it my duty\r\non the present occasion again to urge them upon the attention of the\r\nLegislature. The soundest maxims of public policy and the principles\r\nupon which our republican institutions are founded recommend a proper\r\nadaptation of the revenue to the expenditure, and they also require that\r\nthe expenditure shall be limited to what, by an economical\r\nadministration, shall be consistent with the simplicity of the\r\nGovernment and necessary to an efficient public service. In effecting\r\nthis adjustment it is due, in justice to the interests of the different\r\nStates, and even to the preservation of the Union itself, that the\r\nprotection afforded by existing laws to any branches of the national\r\nindustry should not exceed what may be necessary to counteract the\r\nregulations of foreign nations and to secure a supply of those articles\r\nof manufacture essential to the national independence and safety in time\r\nof war. If upon investigation it shall be found, as it is believed it\r\nwill be, that the legislative protection granted to any particular\r\ninterest is greater than is indispensably requisite for these objects, I\r\nrecommend that it be gradually diminished, and that as far as may be\r\nconsistent with these objects the whole scheme of duties be reduced to\r\nthe revenue standard as soon as a just regard to the faith of the\r\nGovernment and to the preservation of the large capital invested in\r\nestablishments of domestic industry will permit.\r\n\r\nThat manufactures adequate to the supply of our domestic consumption\r\nwould in the abstract be beneficial to our country there is no reason to\r\ndoubt, and to effect their establishment there is perhaps no American\r\ncitizen who would not for awhile be willing to pay a higher price for\r\nthem. But for this purpose it is presumed that a tariff of high duties,\r\ndesigned for perpetual protection, has entered into the minds of but few\r\nof our statesmen. The most they have anticipated is a temporary and,\r\ngenerally, incidental protection, which they maintain has the effect to\r\nreduce the price by domestic competition below that of the foreign\r\narticle. Experience, however, our best guide on this as on other\r\nsubjects, makes it doubtful whether the advantages of this system are\r\nnot counterbalanced by many evils, and whether it does not tend to beget\r\nin the minds of a large portion of our countrymen a spirit of discontent\r\nand jealousy dangerous to the stability of the Union.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, shall be done? Large interests have grown up under the\r\nimplied pledge of our national legislation, which it would seem a\r\nviolation of public faith suddenly to abandon. Nothing could justify it\r\nbut the public safety, which is the supreme law. But those who have\r\nvested their capital in manufacturing establishments can not expect that\r\nthe people will continue permanently to pay high taxes for their\r\nbenefit, when the money is not required for any legitimate purpose in\r\nthe administration of the Government. Is it not enough that the high\r\nduties have been paid as long as the money arising from them could be\r\napplied to the common benefit in the extinguishment of the public debt?\r\n\r\nThose who take an enlarged view of the condition of our country must be\r\nsatisfied that the policy of protection must be ultimately limited to\r\nthose articles of domestic manufacture which are indispensable to our\r\nsafety in time of war. Within this scope, on a reasonable scale, it is\r\nrecommended by every consideration of patriotism and duty, which will\r\ndoubtless always secure to it a liberal and efficient support. But\r\nbeyond this object we have already seen the operation of the system\r\nproductive of discontent. In some sections of the Republic its influence\r\nis deprecated as tending to concentrate wealth into a few hands, and as\r\ncreating those germs of dependence and vice which in other countries\r\nhave characterized the existence of monopolies and proved so destructive\r\nof liberty and the general good. A large portion of the people in one\r\nsection of the Republic declares it not only inexpedient on these\r\ngrounds, but as disturbing the equal relations of property by\r\nlegislation, and therefore unconstitutional and unjust.\r\n\r\nDoubtless these effects are in a great degree exaggerated, and may be\r\nascribed to a mistaken view of the considerations which led to the\r\nadoption of the tariff system; but they are nevertheless important in\r\nenabling us to review the subject with a more thorough knowledge of all\r\nits bearings upon the great interests of the Republic, and with a\r\ndetermination to dispose of it so that none can with justice complain.\r\n\r\nIt is my painful duty to state that in one quarter of the United States\r\nopposition to the revenue laws has arisen to a height which threatens to\r\nthwart their execution, if not to endanger the integrity of the Union.\r\nWhatever obstructions may be thrown in the way of the judicial\r\nauthorities of the General Government, it is hoped they will be able\r\npeaceably to overcome them by the prudence of their own officers and the\r\npatriotism of the people. But should this reasonable reliance on the\r\nmoderation and good sense of all portions of our fellow-citizens be\r\ndisappointed, it is believed that the laws themselves are fully adequate\r\nto the suppression of such attempts as may be immediately made. Should\r\nthe exigency arise rendering the execution of the existing laws\r\nimpracticable from any cause whatever, prompt notice of it will be given\r\nto Congress, with a suggestion of such views and measures as may be\r\ndeemed necessary to meet it.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with principles heretofore explained, and with the hope of\r\nreducing the General Government to that simple machine which the\r\nConstitution created and of withdrawing from the States all other\r\ninfluence than that of its universal beneficence in preserving peace,\r\naffording an uniform currency, maintaining the inviolability of\r\ncontracts, diffusing intelligence, and discharging unfelt its other\r\nsuperintending functions, I recommend that provision be made to dispose\r\nof all stocks now held by it in corporations, whether created by the\r\nGeneral or State Governments, and placing the proceeds in the Treasury.\r\nAs a source of profit these stocks are of little or no value; as a means\r\nof influence among the States they are adverse to the purity of our\r\ninstitutions. The whole principle on which they are based is deemed by\r\nmany unconstitutional, and to persist in the policy which they indicate\r\nis considered wholly inexpedient.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to acquaint you with an arrangement made by the Bank of\r\nthe United States with a portion of the holders of the 3 per cent stock,\r\nby which the Government will be deprived of the use of the public funds\r\nlonger than was anticipated. By this arrangement, which will be\r\nparticularly explained by the Secretary of the Treasury, a surrender of\r\nthe certificates of this stock may be postponed until October, 1833, and\r\nthus the liability of the Government, after its ability to discharge the\r\ndebt, may be continued by the failure of the bank to perform its duties.\r\n\r\nSuch measures as are within the reach of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nhave been taken to enable him to judge whether the public deposits in\r\nthat institution may be regarded as entirely safe; but as his limited\r\npower may prove inadequate to this object, I recommend the subject to\r\nthe attention of Congress, under the firm belief that it is worthy of\r\ntheir serious investigation. An inquiry into the transactions of the\r\ninstitution, embracing the branches as well as the principal bank, seems\r\ncalled for by the credit which is given throughout the country to many\r\nserious charges impeaching its character, and which if true may justly\r\nexcite the apprehension that it is no longer a safe depository of the\r\nmoney of the people.\r\n\r\nAmong the interests which merit the consideration of Congress after the\r\npayment of the public debt, one of the most important, in my view, is\r\nthat of the public lands. Previous to the formation of our present\r\nConstitution it was recommended by Congress that a portion of the waste\r\nlands owned by the States should be ceded to the United States for the\r\npurposes of general harmony and as a fund to meet the expenses of the\r\nwar. The recommendation was adopted, and at different periods of time\r\nthe States of Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, North and South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia granted their vacant soil for the uses for which\r\nthey had been asked. As the lands may now be considered as relieved from\r\nthis pledge, the object for which they were ceded having been\r\naccomplished, it is in the discretion of Congress to dispose of them in\r\nsuch way as best to conduce to the quiet, harmony, and general interest\r\nof the American people. In examining this question all local and\r\nsectional feelings should be discarded and the whole United States\r\nregarded as one people, interested alike in the prosperity of their\r\ncommon country.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that the speedy settlement of these lands\r\nconstitutes the true interest of the Republic. The wealth and strength\r\nof a country are its population, and the best part of that population\r\nare the cultivators of the soil. Independent farmers are everywhere the\r\nbasis of society and true friends of liberty.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these considerations questions have already arisen, and\r\nmay be expected hereafter to grow out of the public lands, which involve\r\nthe rights of the new States and the powers of the General Government,\r\nand unless a liberal policy be now adopted there is danger that these\r\nquestions may speedily assume an importance not now generally\r\nanticipated. The influence of a great sectional interest, when brought\r\ninto full action, will be found more dangerous to the harmony and union\r\nof the States than any other cause of discontent, and it is the part of\r\nwisdom and sound policy to foresee its approaches and endeavor if\r\npossible to counteract them.\r\n\r\nOf the various schemes which have been hitherto proposed in regard to\r\nthe disposal of the public lands, none has yet received the entire\r\napprobation of the National Legislature. Deeply impressed with the\r\nimportance of a speedy and satisfactory arrangement of the subject, I\r\ndeem it my duty on this occasion to urge it upon your consideration, and\r\nto the propositions which have been heretofore suggested by others to\r\ncontribute those reflections which have occurred to me, in the hope that\r\nthey may assist you in your future deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me to be our true policy that the public lands shall cease\r\nas soon as practicable to be a source of revenue, and that they be sold\r\nto settlers in limited parcels at a price barely sufficient to reimburse\r\nto the United States the expense of the present system and the cost\r\narising under our Indian compacts. The advantages of accurate surveys\r\nand undoubted titles now secured to purchasers seem to forbid the\r\nabolition of the present system, because none can be substituted which\r\nwill more perfectly accomplish these important ends. It is desirable,\r\nhowever, that in convenient time this machinery be withdrawn from the\r\nStates, and that the right of soil and the future disposition of it be\r\nsurrendered to the States respectively in which it lies.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous and hardy population of the West, besides contributing\r\ntheir equal share of taxation under our impost system, have in the\r\nprogress of our Government, for the lands they occupy, paid into the\r\nTreasury a large proportion of $40,000,000, and of the revenue received\r\ntherefrom but a small part has been expended amongst them. When to the\r\ndisadvantage of their situation in this respect we add the consideration\r\nthat it is their labor alone which gives real value to the lands, and\r\nthat the proceeds arising from their sale are distributed chiefly among\r\nStates which had not originally any claim to them, and which have\r\nenjoyed the undivided emolument arising from the sale of their own\r\nlands, it can not be expected that the new States will remain longer\r\ncontented with the present policy after the payment of the public debt.\r\nTo avert the consequences which may be apprehended from this cause, to\r\nput an end forever to all partial and interested legislation on the\r\nsubject, and to afford to every American citizen of enterprise the\r\nopportunity of securing an independent freehold, it seems to me,\r\ntherefore, best to abandon the idea of raising a future revenue out of\r\nthe public lands.\r\n\r\nIn former messages I have expressed my conviction that the Constitution\r\ndoes not warrant the application of the funds of the General Government\r\nto objects of internal improvement which are not national in their\r\ncharacter, and, both as a means of doing justice to all interests and\r\nputting an end to a course of legislation calculated to destroy the\r\npurity of the Government, have urged the necessity of reducing the whole\r\nsubject to some fixed and certain rule. As there never will occur a\r\nperiod, perhaps, more propitious than the present to the accomplishment\r\nof this object, I beg leave to press the subject again upon your\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWithout some general and well-defined principles ascertaining those\r\nobjects of internal improvement to which the means of the nation may be\r\nconstitutionally applied, it is obvious that the exercise of the power\r\ncan never be satisfactory. Besides the danger to which it exposes\r\nCongress of making hasty appropriations to works of the character of\r\nwhich they may be frequently ignorant, it promotes a mischievous and\r\ncorrupting influence upon elections by holding out to the people the\r\nfallacious hope that the success of a certain candidate will make\r\nnavigable their neighboring creek or river, bring commerce to their\r\ndoors, and increase the value of their property. It thus favors\r\ncombinations to squander the treasure of the country upon a multitude of\r\nlocal objects, as fatal to just legislation as to the purity of public\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIf a system compatible with the Constitution can not be devised which is\r\nfree from such tendencies, we should recollect that that instrument\r\nprovides within itself the mode of its amendment, and that there is,\r\ntherefore, no excuse for the assumption of doubtful powers by the\r\nGeneral Government. If those which are clearly granted shall be found\r\nincompetent to the ends of its creation, it can at any time apply for\r\ntheir enlargement; and there is no probability that such an application,\r\nif founded on the public interest, will ever be refused. If the\r\npropriety of the proposed grant be not sufficiently apparent to command\r\nthe assent of three-fourths of the States, the best possible reason why\r\nthe power should not be assumed on doubtful authority is afforded; for\r\nif more than one-fourth of the States are unwilling to make the grant\r\nits exercise will be productive of discontents which will far\r\noverbalance any advantages that could be derived from it. All must admit\r\nthat there is nothing so worthy of the constant solicitude of this\r\nGovernment as the harmony and union of the people.\r\n\r\nBeing solemnly impressed with the conviction that the extension of the\r\npower to make internal improvements beyond the limit I have suggested,\r\neven if it be deemed constitutional, is subversive of the best interests\r\nof our country, I earnestly recommend to Congress to refrain from its\r\nexercise in doubtful cases, except in relation to improvements already\r\nbegun, unless they shall first procure from the States such an amendment\r\nof the Constitution as will define its character and prescribe its\r\nbounds. If the States feel themselves competent to these objects, why\r\nshould this Government wish to assume the power? If they do not, then\r\nthey will not hesitate to make the grant. Both Governments are the\r\nGovernments of the people; improvements must be made with the money of\r\nthe people, and if the money can be collected and applied by those more\r\nsimple and economical political machines, the State governments, it will\r\nunquestionably be safer and better for the people than to add to the\r\nsplendor, the patronage, and the power of the General Government. But if\r\nthe people of the several States think otherwise they will amend the\r\nConstitution, and in their decision all ought cheerfully to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed and highly satisfactory view of the operations of the War\r\nDepartment I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThe hostile incursions of the Sac and Fox Indians necessarily led to the\r\ninterposition of the Government. A portion of the troops, under Generals\r\nScott and Atkinson, and of the militia of the State of Illinois were\r\ncalled into the field. After a harassing warfare, prolonged by the\r\nnature of the country and by the difficulty of procuring subsistence,\r\nthe Indians were entirely defeated, and the disaffected band dispersed\r\nor destroyed. The result has been creditable to the troops engaged in\r\nthe service. Severe as is the lesson to the Indians, it was rendered\r\nnecessary by their unprovoked aggressions, and it is to be hoped that\r\nits impression will be permanent and salutary.\r\n\r\nThis campaign has evinced the efficient organization of the Army and its\r\ncapacity for prompt and active service. Its several departments have\r\nperformed their functions with energy and dispatch, and the general\r\nmovement was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOur fellow-citizens upon the frontiers were ready, as they always are,\r\nin the tender of their services in the hour of danger. But a more\r\nefficient organization of our militia system is essential to that\r\nsecurity which is one of the principal objects of all governments.\r\nNeither our situation nor our institutions require or permit the\r\nmaintenance of a large regular force. History offers too many lessons of\r\nthe fatal result of such a measure not to warn us against its adoption\r\nhere. The expense which attends it, the obvious tendency to employ it\r\nbecause it exists and thus to engage in unnecessary wars, and its\r\nultimate danger to public liberty will lead us, I trust, to place our\r\nprincipal dependence for protection upon the great body of the citizens\r\nof the Republic. If in asserting rights or in repelling wrongs war\r\nshould come upon us, our regular force should be increased to an extent\r\nproportioned to the emergency, and our present small Army is a nucleus\r\naround which such force could be formed and embodied. But for the\r\npurposes of defense under ordinary circumstances we must rely upon the\r\nelectors of the country. Those by whom and for whom the Government was\r\ninstituted and is supported will constitute its protection in the hour\r\nof danger as they do its check in the hour of safety.\r\n\r\nBut it is obvious that the militia system is imperfect. Much time is\r\nlost, much unnecessary expense incurred, and much public property wasted\r\nunder the present arrangement. Little useful knowledge is gained by the\r\nmusters and drills as now established, and the whole subject evidently\r\nrequires a thorough examination. Whether a plan of classification\r\nremedying these defects and providing for a system of instruction might\r\nnot be adopted is submitted to the consideration of Congress. The\r\nConstitution has vested in the General Government an independent\r\nauthority upon the subject of the militia which renders its action\r\nessential to the establishment or improvement of the system, and I\r\nrecommend the matter to your consideration in the conviction that the\r\nstate of this important arm of the public defense requires your\r\nattention. I am happy to inform you that the wise and humane policy of\r\ntransferring from the eastern to the western side of the Mississippi the\r\nremnants of our aboriginal tribes, with their own consent and upon just\r\nterms, has been steadily pursued, and is approaching, I trust, its\r\nconsummation. By reference to the report of the Secretary of War and to\r\nthe documents submitted with it you will see the progress which has been\r\nmade since your last session in the arrangement of the various matters\r\nconnected with our Indian relations. With one exception every subject\r\ninvolving any question of conflicting jurisdiction or of peculiar\r\ndifficulty has been happily disposed of, and the conviction evidently\r\ngains ground among the Indians that their removal to the country\r\nassigned by the United States for their permanent residence furnishes\r\nthe only hope of their ultimate prosperity.\r\n\r\nWith that portion of the Cherokees, however, living within the State of\r\nGeorgia it has been found impracticable as yet to make a satisfactory\r\nadjustment. Such was my anxiety to remove all the grounds of complaint\r\nand to bring to a termination the difficulties in which they are\r\ninvolved that I directed the very liberal propositions to be made to\r\nthem which accompany the documents herewith submitted. They can not but\r\nhave seen in these offers the evidence of the strongest disposition on\r\nthe part of the Government to deal justly and liberally with them. An\r\nample indemnity was offered for their present possessions, a liberal\r\nprovision for their future support and improvement, and full security\r\nfor their private and political rights. Whatever difference of opinion\r\nmay have prevailed respecting the just claims of these people, there\r\nwill probably be none respecting the liberality of the propositions, and\r\nvery little respecting the expediency of their immediate acceptance.\r\nThey were, however, rejected, and thus the position of these Indians\r\nremains unchanged, as do the views communicated in my message to the\r\nSenate of February 22, 1831.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the annual report of the Secretary of the Navy, which\r\naccompanies this message, for a detail of the operations of that branch\r\nof the service during the present year.\r\n\r\nBesides the general remarks on some of the transactions of our Navy\r\npresented in the view which has been taken of our foreign relations, I\r\nseize this occasion to invite to your notice the increased protection\r\nwhich it has afforded to our commerce and citizens on distant seas\r\nwithout any augmentation of the force in commission. In the gradual\r\nimprovement of its pecuniary concerns, in the constant progress in the\r\ncollection of materials suitable for use during future emergencies, and\r\nin the construction of vessels and the buildings necessary to their\r\npreservation and repair, the present state of this branch of the service\r\nexhibits the fruits of that vigilance and care which are so\r\nindispensable to its efficiency. Various new suggestions, contained in\r\nthe annexed report, as well as others heretofore submitted to Congress,\r\nare worthy of your attention, but none more so than that urging the\r\nrenewal for another term of six years of the general appropriation for\r\nthe gradual improvement of the Navy.\r\n\r\nFrom the accompanying report of the Postmaster-General you will also\r\nperceive that that Department continues to extend its usefulness without\r\nimpairing its resources or lessening the accommodations which it affords\r\nin the secure and rapid transportation of the mail.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the views heretofore\r\nexpressed in relation to the mode of choosing the President and\r\nVice-President of the United States, and to those respecting the tenure\r\nof office generally. Still impressed with the justness of those views\r\nand with the belief that the modifications suggested on those subjects\r\nif adopted will contribute to the prosperity and harmony of the country,\r\nI earnestly recommend them to your consideration at this time.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore pointed out defects in the law for punishing official\r\nfrauds, especially within the District of Columbia. It has been found\r\nalmost impossible to bring notorious culprits to punishment, and,\r\naccording to a decision of the court for this District, a prosecution is\r\nbarred by a lapse of two years after the fraud has been committed. It\r\nmay happen again, as it has already happened, that during the whole two\r\nyears all the evidences of the fraud may be in the possession of the\r\nculprit himself. However proper the limitation may be in relation to\r\nprivate citizens, it would seem that it ought not to commence running in\r\nfavor of public officers until they go out of office.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary system of the United States remains imperfect. Of the nine\r\nWestern and Southwestern States three only enjoy the benefits of a\r\ncircuit court. Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee are embraced in the general\r\nsystem, but Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, and\r\nLouisiana have only district courts. If the existing system be a good\r\none, why should it not be extended? If it be a bad one, why is it\r\nsuffered to exist? The new States were promised equal rights and\r\nprivileges when they came into the Union, and such are the guaranties of\r\nthe Constitution. Nothing can be more obvious than the obligation of the\r\nGeneral Government to place all the States on the same footing in\r\nrelation to the administration of justice, and I trust this duty will be\r\nneglected no longer.\r\n\r\nOn many of the subjects to which your attention is invited in this\r\ncommunication it is a source of gratification to reflect that the steps\r\nto be now adopted are uninfluenced by the embarrassments entailed upon\r\nthe country by the wars through which it has passed. In regard to most\r\nof our great interests we may consider ourselves as just starting in our\r\ncareer, and after a salutary experience about to fix upon a permanent\r\nbasis the policy best calculated to promote the happiness of the people\r\nand facilitate their progress toward the most complete enjoyment of\r\ncivil liberty. On an occasion so interesting and important in our\r\nhistory, and of such anxious concern to the friends of freedom\r\nthroughout the world, it is our imperious duty to lay aside all selfish\r\nand local considerations and be guided by a lofty spirit of devotion to\r\nthe great principles on which our institutions are founded.\r\n\r\nThat this Government may be so administered as to preserve its\r\nefficiency in promoting and securing these general objects should be the\r\nonly aim of our ambition, and we can not, therefore, too carefully\r\nexamine its structure, in order that we may not mistake its powers or\r\nassume those which the people have reserved to themselves or have\r\npreferred to assign to other agents. We should bear constantly in mind\r\nthe fact that the considerations which induced the framers of the\r\nConstitution to withhold from the General Government the power to\r\nregulate the great mass of the business and concerns of the people have\r\nbeen fully justified by experience, and that it can not now be doubted\r\nthat the genius of all our institutions prescribes simplicity and\r\neconomy as the characteristics of the reform which is yet to be effected\r\nin the present and future execution of the functions bestowed upon us by\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nLimited to a general superintending power to maintain peace at home and\r\nabroad, and to prescribe laws on a few subjects of general interest not\r\ncalculated to restrict human liberty, but to enforce human rights, this\r\nGovernment will find its strength and its glory in the faithful\r\ndischarge of these plain and simple duties. Relieved by its protecting\r\nshield from the fear of war and the apprehension of oppression, the free\r\nenterprise of our citizens, aided by the State sovereignties, will work\r\nout improvements and ameliorations which can not fail to demonstrate\r\nthat the great truth that the people can govern themselves is not only\r\nrealized in our example, but that it is done by a machinery in\r\ngovernment so simple and economical as scarcely to be felt. That the\r\nAlmighty Ruler of the Universe may so direct our deliberations and\r\noverrule our acts as to make us instrumental in securing a result so\r\ndear to mankind is my most earnest and sincere prayer.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1832_.\r\n_The President of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for its consideration and advice, a treaty of\r\namity and commerce between the United States of America and the Republic\r\nof Chili, concluded at Santiago on the 16th day of May, 1832.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration and advice of the Senate as\r\nto their ratification, treaties that have been concluded by\r\ncommissioners duly appointed on the part of the United States with the\r\nfollowing tribes of Indians, viz: The Chickasaws, the Apalachicola band\r\nin Florida, the Sacs and Foxes, the Winnebagoes, the Potawatamies of\r\nIndiana and Michigan, the Potawatamies of the Wabash and Elkheart, and\r\nthe Potawatamies of the Prairie.\r\n\r\nI also transmit the report and journals of the commissioners.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1832_.\r\n_The President of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nA convention having been concluded at Naples on the 14th October, 1832,\r\nbetween the United States and the Government of the Two Sicilies, I now\r\nlay it before the Senate for its constitutional action upon it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate requesting the President\r\nof the United States \"to communicate to the Senate copies of the\r\ncommission appointing Samuel Gwin register of the land office at Mount\r\nSalus, in the State of Mississippi, in the recess of the Senate in 1831,\r\nand of the commission appointing the said Gwin to the same office in the\r\nrecess of the Senate in 1832, and also a copy of the opinion of the\r\nAttorney-General of the United States in relation to said last-mentioned\r\ncommission, and also the opinions, if any, of former Attorneys-General\r\nin similar cases, and copies of the commissions which may have issued in\r\nlike cases, if any, under former Administrations,\" I transmit herewith\r\nthe papers called for.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to remark of the case of the navy agent, supposed to be\r\nanalogous to that of Mr. Gwin, that the commissions are not usually\r\nrecorded. The one transmitted, however, is the form generally observed,\r\nvaried to suit the circumstances of the case, and omitting or inserting\r\nthe words \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\" according\r\nto the time the appointment is made.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 21, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the accompanying\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of State, inclosing a correspondence\r\nbetween him and the artist employed to execute the statue of Washington\r\nwhich is to be placed in the Rotunda of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this correspondence that the present appropriation for\r\nthe execution of this work is inadequate to the object, and I therefore\r\nfeel it my duty before concluding the contract to ascertain whether the\r\nadditional sum recommended as proper by the Secretary of State and the\r\nterms proposed by the artist will meet the approbation of Congress.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the papers are respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the accompanying\r\nreports--one from the engineer selected under the act of the 14th July\r\nlast to take charge of the survey of the bridge across the Potomac which\r\nthat act authorized the President to cause to be erected, and showing,\r\nafter a careful survey, the propriety of applying a part of the sum\r\nappropriated to the repairing the old bridge; the other showing the\r\nconsiderations which, in the opinion of the same engineer and that of\r\nGeneral Gratiot, should determine the choice between a superstructure of\r\nwood and of iron on the same foundation of granite.\r\n\r\nConcurring in the reasons stated by these officers for the preference of\r\nthe superstructure of wood, I have adopted it accordingly, and propose\r\nto take the measures necessary for the execution of the work.\r\nPreviously, however, to inviting contracts for this purpose I deem it\r\nadvisable to submit the subject to Congress, in order that the necessary\r\nappropriations may be supplied.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 28, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have taken into consideration the resolution of the House requesting\r\nme to communicate to it, so far as in my opinion may be consistent with\r\nthe public interest, \"the correspondence between the Government of the\r\nUnited States and that of the Republic of Buenos Ayres which has\r\nresulted in the departure of the chargé d'affaires of the United States\r\nfrom that Republic, together with the instructions given to the said\r\nchargé d'affaires,\" and in answer to the said request state for the\r\ninformation of the House that although the chargé d'affaires of the\r\nUnited States has found it necessary to return, yet the negotiation\r\nbetween the two countries for the arrangement of the differences between\r\nthem are not considered as broken off, but are suspended only until the\r\narrival of a minister, who, it is officially announced, will be sent to\r\nthis country with powers to treat on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis fact, it is believed, will justify the opinion I have formed that\r\nit will not be consistent with the public interest to communicate the\r\ncorrespondence and instructions requested by the House so long as the\r\nnegotiation shall be pending.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 2, 1833_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State on the subject\r\nof the French ship _Pactole_, upon the cargo of which a discriminating\r\nduty seems to have been levied in 1827 by the collector at Pensacola, in\r\ncontravention, as is alleged, with the convention of 1822 with France.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, _January 6, 1833_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI beg leave to call the attention of Congress to the accompanying report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State, recommending an appropriation to refund the\r\namount of duties that have been collected in the ports of the United\r\nStates on the tonnage of foreign vessels belonging to nations that have\r\nabolished in their ports discriminating duties on the vessels of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI also transmit herewith another report from the Secretary of State,\r\nstating the losses to which certain Swedish subjects allege they were\r\nexposed by the taking out of one of the ports of St. Bartholomew, in the\r\nyear 1828, a vessel under the flag of the Republic of Buenos Ayres, by\r\nthe commander of the United States ship _Erie_, and for the payment of\r\nwhich it is thought provision ought to be made by Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7, 1833_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives the report of the Secretary\r\nof State upon the subject of the duties on the cargo of the French ship\r\n_Pactole_, prepared in obedience to the resolution of that House of the\r\n20th of December, 1832, which was referred to him.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 28th ultimo,\r\nrequesting the President of the United States to communicate to the\r\nSenate a copy of the treaty concluded at Franklin, in the State of\r\nTennessee, between the United States and the Chickasaw tribe of Indians,\r\non the ---- day of August, 1830, together with a copy of the\r\ninstructions, if any, to the commissioner who negotiated the treaty with\r\nsaid tribe of Indians, bearing date the 30th day of October, 1832, I\r\ntransmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, containing the\r\ninformation required.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_January 8, 1833_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 10, 1833_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of the 4th instant,\r\nrequesting to be furnished with such information as the President may\r\npossess \"in relation to the survey of the northern boundary of the State\r\nof Ohio under the provisions of the act of Congress passed for that\r\npurpose on the 14th of July, 1832,\" I transmit herewith a report from\r\nthe Secretary of War containing it.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 14, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their advice and consent as to\r\nthe ratification of the same, treaties that have been concluded by\r\ncommissioners duly appointed on the part of the United States with the\r\nfollowing Indian tribes, viz: With the Kickapoos; with the Shawanoes and\r\nDelawares, late of Cape Gerardeau, together with stipulations with\r\nDelawares for certain private annuities; with the Pankeshaws and\r\nPeorias.\r\n\r\nI also transmit the journal of the commissioners who negotiated these\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 16, 1833_.\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my annual message at the commencement of your present session I\r\nadverted to the opposition to the revenue laws in a particular quarter\r\nof the United States, which threatened not merely to thwart their\r\nexecution, but to endanger the integrity of the Union; and although I\r\nthen expressed my reliance that it might be overcome by the prudence of\r\nthe officers of the United States and the patriotism of the people, I\r\nstated that should the emergency arise rendering the execution of the\r\nexisting laws impracticable from any cause whatever prompt notice should\r\nbe given to Congress, with the suggestion of such views and measures as\r\nmight be necessary to meet it.\r\n\r\nEvents which have occurred in the quarter then alluded to, or which have\r\ncome to my knowledge subsequently, present this emergency.\r\n\r\nSince the date of my last annual message I have had officially\r\ntransmitted to me by the governor of South Carolina, which I now\r\ncommunicate to Congress, a copy of the ordinance passed by the\r\nconvention which assembled at Columbia, in the State of South Carolina,\r\nin November last, declaring certain acts of Congress therein mentioned\r\nwithin the limits of that State to be absolutely null and void, and\r\nmaking it the duty of the legislature to pass such laws as would be\r\nnecessary to carry the same into effect from and after the 1st February\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThe consequences to which this extraordinary defiance of the just\r\nauthority of the Government might too surely lead were clearly foreseen,\r\nand it was impossible for me to hesitate as to my own duty in such an\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance had been passed, however, without any certain knowledge of\r\nthe recommendation which, from a view of the interests of the nation at\r\nlarge, the Executive had determined to submit to Congress, and a hope\r\nwas indulged that by frankly explaining his sentiments and the nature of\r\nthose duties which the crisis would devolve upon him the authorities of\r\nSouth Carolina might be induced to retrace their steps. In this hope I\r\ndetermined to issue my proclamation of the 10th of December last, a copy\r\nof which I now lay before Congress.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that these reasonable expectations have not been\r\nrealized, and that the several acts of the legislature of South Carolina\r\nwhich I now lay before you, and which have all and each of them finally\r\npassed after a knowledge of the desire of the Administration to modify\r\nthe laws complained of, are too well calculated both in their positive\r\nenactments and in the spirit of opposition which they obviously\r\nencourage wholly to obstruct the collection of the revenue within the\r\nlimits of that State.\r\n\r\nUp to this period neither the recommendation of the Executive in regard\r\nto our financial policy and impost system, nor the disposition\r\nmanifested by Congress promptly to act upon that subject, nor the\r\nunequivocal expression of the public will in all parts of the Union\r\nappears to have produced any relaxation in the measures of opposition\r\nadopted by the State of South Carolina; nor is there any reason to hope\r\nthat the ordinance and laws will be abandoned.\r\n\r\nI have no knowledge that an attempt has been made, or that it is in\r\ncontemplation, to reassemble either the convention or the legislature,\r\nand it will be perceived that the interval before the 1st of February is\r\ntoo short to admit of the preliminary steps necessary for that purpose.\r\nIt appears, moreover, that the State authorities are actively organizing\r\ntheir military resources, and providing the means and giving the most\r\nsolemn assurances of protection and support to all who shall enlist in\r\nopposition to the revenue laws.\r\n\r\nA recent proclamation of the present governor of South Carolina has\r\nopenly defied the authority of the Executive of the Union, and general\r\norders from the headquarters of the State announced his determination to\r\naccept the services of volunteers and his belief that should their\r\ncountry need their services they will be found at the post of honor and\r\nduty, ready to lay down their lives in her defense. Under these orders\r\nthe forces referred to are directed to \"hold themselves in readiness to\r\ntake the field at a moment's warning,\" and in the city of Charleston,\r\nwithin a collection district, and a port of entry, a rendezvous has been\r\nopened for the purpose of enlisting men for the magazine and municipal\r\nguard. Thus South Carolina presents herself in the attitude of hostile\r\npreparation, and ready even for military violence if need be to enforce\r\nher laws for preventing the collection of the duties within her limits.\r\n\r\nProceedings thus announced and matured must be distinguished from\r\nmenaces of unlawful resistance by irregular bodies of people, who,\r\nacting under temporary delusion, may be restrained by reflection and the\r\ninfluence of public opinion from the commission of actual outrage. In\r\nthe present instance aggression may be regarded as committed when it is\r\nofficially authorized and the means of enforcing it fully provided.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances there can be no doubt that it is the\r\ndetermination of the authorities of South Carolina fully to carry into\r\neffect their ordinance and laws after the 1st of February. It therefore\r\nbecomes my duty to bring the subject to the serious consideration of\r\nCongress, in order that such measures as they in their wisdom may deem\r\nfit shall be seasonably provided, and that it may be thereby understood\r\nthat while the Government is disposed to remove all just cause of\r\ncomplaint as far as may be practicable consistently with a proper regard\r\nto the interests of the community at large, it is nevertheless\r\ndetermined that the supremacy of the laws shall be maintained.\r\n\r\nIn making this communication it appears to me to be proper not only that\r\nI should lay before you the acts and proceedings of South Carolina, but\r\nthat I should also fully acquaint you with those steps which I have\r\nalready caused to be taken for the due collection of the revenue, and\r\nwith my views of the subject generally, that the suggestions which the\r\nConstitution requires me to make in regard to your future legislation\r\nmay be better understood.\r\n\r\nThis subject having early attracted the anxious attention of the\r\nExecutive, as soon as it was probable that the authorities of South\r\nCarolina seriously meditated resistance to the faithful execution of the\r\nrevenue laws it was deemed advisable that the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nshould particularly instruct the officers of the United States in that\r\npart of the Union as to the nature of the duties prescribed by the\r\nexisting laws.\r\n\r\nInstructions were accordingly issued on the 6th of November to the\r\ncollectors in that State, pointing out their respective duties and\r\nenjoining upon each a firm and vigilant but discreet performance of them\r\nin the emergency then apprehended.\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit copies of these instructions and of the letter\r\naddressed to the district attorney, requesting his cooperation. These\r\ninstructions were dictated in the hope that as the opposition to the\r\nlaws by the anomalous proceeding of nullification was represented to be\r\nof a pacific nature, to be pursued substantially according to the forms\r\nof the Constitution and without resorting in any event to force or\r\nviolence, the measures of its advocates would be taken in conformity\r\nwith that profession, and on such supposition the means afforded by the\r\nexisting laws would have been adequate to meet any emergency likely to\r\narise.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, not possible altogether to suppress apprehension of the\r\nexcesses to which the excitement prevailing in that quarter might lead,\r\nbut it certainly was not foreseen that the meditated obstruction to the\r\nlaws would so soon openly assume its present character.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the date of those instructions, however, the ordinance\r\nof the convention was passed, which, if complied with by the people of\r\nthe State, must effectually render inoperative the present revenue laws\r\nwithin her limits.\r\n\r\nThat ordinance declares and ordains--\r\n\r\n    That the several acts and parts of acts of the Congress of the\r\n    United States purporting to be laws for the imposing of duties and\r\n    imposts on the importation of foreign commodities, and now having\r\n    operation and effect within the United States, and more especially\r\n    \"An act in alteration of the several acts imposing duties on\r\n    imports,\" approved on the 19th of May, 1828, and also an act\r\n    entitled \"An act to alter and amend the several acts imposing duties\r\n    on imports,\" approved on the 14th July, 1832, are unauthorized by\r\n    the Constitution of the United States, and violate the true intent\r\n    and meaning thereof, and are null and void and no law, nor binding\r\n    upon the State of South Carolina, its officers and citizens; and all\r\n    promises, contracts, and obligations made or entered into, or to be\r\n    made or entered into, with purpose to secure the duties imposed by\r\n    the said acts, and all judicial proceedings which shall be hereafter\r\n    had in affirmance thereof, are and shall be held utterly null and\r\n    void.\r\n\r\nIt also ordains--\r\n\r\n    That it shall not be lawful for any of the constituted authorities,\r\n    whether of the State of South Carolina or of the United States, to\r\n    enforce the payment of duties imposed by the said acts within the\r\n    limits of the State, but that it shall be the duty of the\r\n    legislature to adopt such measures and pass such acts as may be\r\n    necessary to give full effect to this ordinance and to prevent the\r\n    enforcement and arrest the operation of the said acts and parts of\r\n    acts of the Congress of the United States within the limits of the\r\n    State from and after the 1st of February next; and it shall be the\r\n    duty of all other constituted authorities and of all other persons\r\n    residing or being within the limits of the State, and they are\r\n    hereby required and enjoined, to obey and give effect to this\r\n    ordinance and such acts and measures of the legislature as may be\r\n    passed or adopted in obedience thereto.\r\n\r\nIt further ordains--\r\n\r\n    That in no case of law or equity decided in the courts of the State\r\n    wherein shall be drawn in question the authority of this ordinance,\r\n    or the validity of such act or acts of the legislature as may be\r\n    passed for the purpose of giving effect thereto, or the validity of\r\n    the aforesaid acts of Congress imposing duties, shall any appeal be\r\n    taken or allowed to the Supreme Court of the United States, nor\r\n    shall any copy of the record be permitted or allowed for that\r\n    purpose; and the person or persons attempting to take such appeal\r\n    may be dealt with as for a contempt of court.\r\n\r\nIt likewise ordains--\r\n\r\n    That all persons holding any office of honor, profit, or trust,\r\n    civil or military, under the State shall, within such time and in\r\n    such manner as the legislature shall prescribe, take an oath well\r\n    and truly to obey, execute, and enforce this ordinance and such act\r\n    or acts of the legislature as may be passed in pursuance thereof,\r\n    according to the true intent and meaning of the same; and on the\r\n    neglect or omission of any such person or persons so to do his or\r\n    their office or offices shall be forthwith vacated, and shall be\r\n    filled up as if such person or persons were dead or had resigned.\r\n    And no person hereafter elected to any office of honor, profit, or\r\n    trust, civil or military, shall, until the legislature shall\r\n    otherwise provide and direct, enter on the execution of his office\r\n    or be in any respect competent to discharge the duties thereof until\r\n    he shall in like manner have taken a similar oath; and no juror\r\n    shall be empaneled in any of the courts of the State in any cause in\r\n    which shall be in question this ordinance or any act of the\r\n    legislature passed in pursuance thereof, unless he shall first, in\r\n    addition to the usual oath, have taken an oath that he will well and\r\n    truly obey, execute, and enforce this ordinance and such act or acts\r\n    of the legislature as may be passed to carry the same into operation\r\n    and effect, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance concludes:\r\n\r\n    And we, the people of South Carolina, to the end that it may be\r\n    fully understood by the Government of the United States and the\r\n    people of the co-States that we are determined to maintain this\r\n    ordinance and declaration at every hazard, do further declare that\r\n    we will not submit to the application of force on the part of the\r\n    Federal Government to reduce this State to obedience, but that we\r\n    will consider the passage by Congress of any act authorizing the\r\n    employment of a military or naval force against the State of South\r\n    Carolina, her constituted authorities or citizens, or any act\r\n    abolishing or closing the ports of this State, or any of them, or\r\n    otherwise obstructing the free ingress and egress of vessels to and\r\n    from the said ports, or any other act on the part of the Federal\r\n    Government to coerce the State, shut up her ports, destroy or harass\r\n    her commerce, or to enforce the acts hereby declared to be null and\r\n    void, otherwise than through the civil tribunals of the country, as\r\n    inconsistent with the longer continuance of South Carolina in the\r\n    Union; and that the people of this State will thenceforth hold\r\n    themselves absolved from all further obligation to maintain or\r\n    preserve their political connection with the people of the other\r\n    States, and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government\r\n    and to do all other acts and things which sovereign and independent\r\n    states may of right do.\r\n\r\nThis solemn denunciation of the laws and authority of the United States\r\nhas been followed up by a series of acts on the part of the authorities\r\nof that State which manifest a determination to render inevitable a\r\nresort to those measures of self-defense which the paramount duty of the\r\nFederal Government requires, but upon the adoption of which that State\r\nwill proceed to execute the purpose it has avowed in this ordinance of\r\nwithdrawing from the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of November the legislature assembled at Columbia, and on\r\ntheir meeting the governor laid before them the ordinance of the\r\nconvention. In his message on that occasion he acquaints them that \"this\r\nordinance has thus become a part of the fundamental law of South\r\nCarolina;\" that \"the die has been at last cast, and South Carolina has\r\nat length appealed to her ulterior sovereignty as a member of this\r\nConfederacy and has planted herself on her reserved rights. The rightful\r\nexercise of this power is not a question which we shall any longer\r\nargue. It is sufficient that she has willed it, and that the act is\r\ndone; nor is its strict compatibility with our constitutional obligation\r\nto all laws passed by the General Government within the authorized\r\ngrants of power to be drawn in question when this interposition is\r\nexerted in a case in which the compact has been palpably, deliberately,\r\nand dangerously violated. That it brings up a conjuncture of deep and\r\nmomentous interest is neither to be concealed nor denied. This crisis\r\npresents a class of duties which is referable to yourselves. You have\r\nbeen commanded by the people in their highest sovereignty to take care\r\nthat within the limits of this State their will shall be obeyed.\" \"The\r\nmeasure of legislation,\" he says, \"which you have to employ at this\r\ncrisis is the precise amount of such enactments as may be necessary to\r\nrender it utterly impossible to collect within our limits the duties\r\nimposed by the protective tariffs thus nullified.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeds:\r\n\r\n    That you should arm every citizen with a civil process by which he\r\n    may claim, if he pleases, a restitution of his goods seized under\r\n    the existing imposts on his giving security to abide the issue of a\r\n    suit at law, and at the same time define what shall constitute\r\n    treason against the State, and by a bill of pains and penalties\r\n    compel obedience and punish disobedience to your own laws, are\r\n    points too obvious to require any discussion. In one word, you must\r\n    survey the whole ground. You must look to and provide for all\r\n    possible contingencies. In your own limits your own courts of\r\n    judicature must not only be supreme, but you must look to the\r\n    ultimate issue of any conflict of jurisdiction and power between\r\n    them and the courts of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe governor also asks for power to grant clearances, in violation of\r\nthe laws of the Union; and to prepare for the alternative which must\r\nhappen unless the United States shall passively surrender their\r\nauthority, and the Executive, disregarding his oath, refrain from\r\nexecuting the laws of the Union, he recommends a thorough revision of\r\nthe militia system, and that the governor \"be authorized to accept for\r\nthe defense of Charleston and its dependencies the services of 2,000\r\nvolunteers, either by companies or files,\" and that they be formed into\r\na legionary brigade consisting of infantry, riflemen, cavalry, field and\r\nheavy artillery, and that they be \"armed and equipped from the public\r\narsenals completely for the field, and that appropriations be made for\r\nsupplying all deficiencies in our munitions of war.\" In addition to\r\nthese volunteer drafts, he recommends that the governor be authorized\r\n\"to accept the services of 10,000 volunteers from the other divisions of\r\nthe State, to be organized and arranged in regiments and brigades, the\r\nofficers to be selected by the commander in chief, and that this whole\r\nforce be called _the State guard_.\"\r\n\r\nA request has been regularly made of the secretary of state of South\r\nCarolina for authentic copies of the acts which have been passed for the\r\npurpose of enforcing the ordinance, but up to the date of the latest\r\nadvices that request had not been complied with, and on the present\r\noccasion, therefore, reference can only be made to those acts as\r\npublished in the newspapers of the State.\r\n\r\nThe acts to which it is deemed proper to invite the particular attention\r\nof Congress are:\r\n\r\nFirst. \"An act to carry into effect, in part, an ordinance to nullify\r\ncertain acts of the Congress of the United States purporting to be laws\r\nlaying duties on the importation of foreign commodities,\" passed in\r\nconvention of this State, at Columbia, on the 24th November, 1832.\r\n\r\nThis act provides that any goods seized or detained under pretense of\r\nsecuring the duties, or for the nonpayment of duties, or under any\r\nprocess, order, or decree, or other pretext contrary to the intent and\r\nmeaning of the ordinance may be recovered by the owner or consignee by\r\n\"an act of replevin;\" that in case of refusing to deliver them, or\r\nremoving them so that the replevin can not be executed, the sheriff may\r\nseize the personal estate of the offender to double the amount of the\r\ngoods, and if any attempt shall be made to retake or seize them it is\r\nthe duty of the sheriff to recapture them; and that any person who shall\r\ndisobey the process or remove the goods, or anyone who shall attempt to\r\nretake or seize the goods under pretense of securing the duties, or for\r\nnonpayment of duties, or under any process or decree contrary to the\r\nintent of the ordinance, shall be fined and imprisoned, besides being\r\nliable for any other offense involved in the act.\r\n\r\nIt also provides that any person arrested or imprisoned on any judgment\r\nor decree obtained in any Federal court for duties shall be entitled to\r\nthe benefit secured by the habeas corpus act of the State in cases of\r\nunlawful arrest, and may maintain an action for damages, and that if any\r\nestate shall be sold under such judgment or decree the sale shall be\r\nheld illegal. It also provides that any jailer who receives a person\r\ncommitted on any process or other judicial proceedings to enforce the\r\npayment of duties, and anyone who hires his house as a jail to receive\r\nsuch persons, shall be fined and imprisoned. And, finally, it provides\r\nthat persons paying duties may recover them back with interest.\r\n\r\nThe next is called \"An act to provide for the security and protection of\r\nthe people of the State of South Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nThis act provides that if the Government of the United States or any\r\nofficer thereof shall, by the employment of naval or military force,\r\nattempt to coerce the State of South Carolina into submission to the\r\nacts of Congress declared by the ordinance null and void, or to resist\r\nthe enforcement of the ordinance or of the laws passed in pursuance\r\nthereof, or in case of any armed or forcible resistance thereto, the\r\ngovernor is authorized to resist the same and to order into service the\r\nwhole or so much of the military force of the State as he may deem\r\nnecessary; and that in case of any overt act of coercion or intention to\r\ncommit the same, manifested by an unusual assemblage of naval or\r\nmilitary forces in or near the State, or the occurrence of any\r\ncircumstances indicating that armed force is about to be employed\r\nagainst the State or in resistance to its laws, the governor is\r\nauthorized to accept the services of such volunteers and call into\r\nservice such portions of the militia as may be required to meet the\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe act also provides for accepting the service of the volunteers and\r\norganizing the militia, embracing all free white males between the ages\r\nof 16 and 60, and for the purchase of arms, ordnance, and ammunition. It\r\nalso declares that the power conferred on the governor shall be\r\napplicable to all cases of insurrection or invasion, or imminent danger\r\nthereof, and to cases where the laws of the State shall be opposed and\r\nthe execution thereof forcibly resisted by combinations too powerful to\r\nbe suppressed by the power vested in the sheriffs and other civil\r\nofficers, and declares it to be the duty of the governor in every such\r\ncase to call forth such portions of the militia and volunteers as may be\r\nnecessary promptly to suppress such combinations and cause the laws of\r\nthe State to be executed.\r\n\r\nNo. 9 is \"An act concerning the oath required by the ordinance passed in\r\nconvention at Columbia on the 24th of November, 1832.\"\r\n\r\nThis act prescribes the form of the oath, which is, to obey and execute\r\nthe ordinance and all acts passed by the legislature in pursuance\r\nthereof, and directs the time and manner of taking it by the officers of\r\nthe State--civil, judiciary, and military.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that other acts have been passed embracing provisions for\r\nenforcing the ordinance, but I have not yet been able to procure them.\r\n\r\nI transmit, however, a copy of Governor Hamilton's message to the\r\nlegislature of South Carolina; of Governor Hayne's inaugural address to\r\nthe same body, as also of his proclamation, and a general order of the\r\ngovernor and commander in chief, dated the 20th of December, giving\r\npublic notice that the services of volunteers will be accepted under the\r\nact already referred to.\r\n\r\nIf these measures can not be defeated and overcome by the power\r\nconferred by the Constitution on the Federal Government, the\r\nConstitution must be considered as incompetent to its own defense, the\r\nsupremacy of the laws is at an end, and the rights and liberties of the\r\ncitizens can no longer receive protection from the Government of the\r\nUnion. They not only abrogate the acts of Congress commonly called the\r\ntariff acts of 1828 and 1832, but they prostrate and sweep away at once\r\nand without exception every act and every part of every act imposing any\r\namount whatever of duty on any foreign merchandise, and virtually every\r\nexisting act which has ever been passed authorizing the collection of\r\nthe revenue, including the act of 1816, and also the collection law of\r\n1799, the constitutionality of which has never been questioned. It is\r\nnot only those duties which are charged to have been imposed for the\r\nprotection of manufactures that are thereby repealed, but all others,\r\nthough laid for the purpose of revenue merely, and upon articles in no\r\ndegree suspected of being objects of protection. The whole revenue\r\nsystem of the United States in South Carolina is obstructed and\r\noverthrown, and the Government is absolutely prohibited from collecting\r\nany part of the public revenue within the limits of that State.\r\nHenceforth, not only the citizens of South Carolina and of the United\r\nStates, but the subjects of foreign states may import any description or\r\nquantity of merchandise into the ports of South Carolina without the\r\npayment of any duty whatsoever. That State is thus relieved from the\r\npayment of any part of the public burthens, and duties and imposts are\r\nnot only rendered not uniform throughout the United States, but a direct\r\nand ruinous preference is given to the ports of that State over those of\r\nall the other States of the Union, in manifest violation of the positive\r\nprovisions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn point of duration, also, those aggressions upon the authority of\r\nCongress which by the ordinance are made part of the fundamental law of\r\nSouth Carolina are absolute, indefinite, and without limitation. They\r\nneither prescribe the period when they shall cease nor indicate any\r\nconditions upon which those who have thus undertaken to arrest the\r\noperation of the laws are to retrace their steps and rescind their\r\nmeasures. They offer to the United States no alternative but\r\nunconditional submission. If the scope of the ordinance is to be\r\nreceived as the scale of concession, their demands can be satisfied only\r\nby a repeal of the whole system of revenue laws and by abstaining from\r\nthe collection of any duties and imposts whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the address to the people of the United States by the\r\nconvention of South Carolina, after announcing \"the fixed and final\r\ndetermination of the State in relation to the protecting system,\" they\r\nsay \"that it remains for us to submit a plan of taxation in which we\r\nwould be willing to acquiesce in a liberal spirit of concession,\r\nprovided we are met in due time and in a becoming spirit by the States\r\ninterested in manufactures.\" In the opinion of the convention, an\r\nequitable plan would be that \"the whole list of protected articles\r\nshould be imported free of all duty, and that the revenue derived from\r\nimport duties should be raised exclusively from the unprotected\r\narticles, or that whenever a duty is imposed upon protected articles\r\nimported an excise duty of the same rate shall be imposed upon all\r\nsimilar articles manufactured in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe address proceeds to state, however, that \"they are willing to make a\r\nlarge offering to preserve the Union, and, with a distinct declaration\r\nthat it is a concession on our part, we will consent that the same rate\r\nof duty may be imposed upon the protected articles that shall be imposed\r\nupon the unprotected, provided that no more revenue be raised than is\r\nnecessary to meet the demands of the Government for constitutional\r\npurposes, and provided also that a duty substantially uniform be imposed\r\nupon all foreign imports.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also true that in his message to the legislature, when urging the\r\nnecessity of providing \"means of securing their safety by ample\r\nresources for repelling force by force,\" the governor of South Carolina\r\nobserves that he \"can not but think that on a calm and dispassionate\r\nreview by Congress and the functionaries of the General Government of\r\nthe true merits of this controversy the arbitration by a call of a\r\nconvention of all the States, which we sincerely and anxiously seek and\r\ndesire, will be accorded to us.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the diversity of terms indicated in these two important documents,\r\ntaken in connection with the progress of recent events in that quarter,\r\nthere is too much reason to apprehend, without in any manner doubting\r\nthe intentions of those public functionaries, that neither the terms\r\nproposed in the address of the convention nor those alluded to in the\r\nmessage of the governor would appease the excitement which has led to\r\nthe present excesses. It is obvious, however, that should the latter be\r\ninsisted on they present an alternative which the General Government of\r\nitself can by no possibility grant, since by an express provision of the\r\nConstitution Congress can call a convention for the purpose of proposing\r\namendments only \"on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of\r\nthe States.\" And it is not perceived that the terms presented in the\r\naddress are more practicable than those referred to in the message.\r\n\r\nIt will not escape attention that the conditions on which it is said in\r\nthe address of the convention they \"would be willing to acquiesce\" form\r\nno part of the ordinance. While this ordinance bears all the solemnity\r\nof a fundamental law, is to be authoritative upon all within the limits\r\nof South Carolina, and is absolute and unconditional in its terms, the\r\naddress conveys only the sentiments of the convention, in no binding or\r\npractical form; one is the act of the State, the other only the\r\nexpression of the opinions of the members of the convention. To limit\r\nthe effect of that solemn act by any terms or conditions whatever, they\r\nshould have been embodied in it, and made of import no less\r\nauthoritative than the act itself. By the positive enactments of the\r\nordinance the execution of the laws of the Union is absolutely\r\nprohibited, and the address offers no other prospect of their being\r\nagain restored, even in the modified form proposed, than what depends\r\nupon the improbable contingency that amid changing events and increasing\r\nexcitement the sentiments of the present members of the convention and\r\nof their successors will remain the same.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted, however, that these conditions, even if they had\r\nbeen offered in the same binding form, are so undefined, depend upon so\r\nmany contingencies, and are so directly opposed to the known opinions\r\nand interests of the great body of the American people as to be almost\r\nhopeless of attainment. The majority of the States and of the people\r\nwill certainly not consent that the protecting duties shall be wholly\r\nabrogated, never to be reenacted at any future time or in any possible\r\ncontingency. As little practicable is it to provide that \"the same rate\r\nof duty shall be imposed upon the protected articles that shall be\r\nimposed upon the unprotected,\" which, moreover, would be severely\r\noppressive to the poor, and in time of war would add greatly to its\r\nrigors. And though there can be no objection to the principle, properly\r\nunderstood, that no more revenue shall be raised than is necessary for\r\nthe constitutional purposes of the Government, which principle has been\r\nalready recommended by the Executive as the true basis of taxation, yet\r\nit is very certain that South Carolina alone can not be permitted to\r\ndecide what these constitutional purposes are.\r\n\r\nThe period which constitutes the due time in which the terms proposed in\r\nthe address are to be accepted would seem to present scarcely less\r\ndifficulty than the terms themselves. Though the revenue laws are\r\nalready declared to be void in South Carolina, as well as the bonds\r\ntaken under them and the judicial proceedings for carrying them into\r\neffect, yet as the full action and operation of the ordinance are to be\r\nsuspended until the 1st of February the interval may be assumed as the\r\ntime within which it is expected that the most complicated portion of\r\nthe national legislation, a system of long standing and affecting great\r\ninterests in the community, is to be rescinded and abolished. If this be\r\nrequired, it is clear that a compliance is impossible.\r\n\r\nIn the uncertainty, then, that exists as to the duration of the\r\nordinance and of the enactments for enforcing it, it becomes imperiously\r\nthe duty of the Executive of the United States, acting with a proper\r\nregard to all the great interests committed to his care, to treat those\r\nacts as absolute and unlimited. They are so as far as his agency is\r\nconcerned. He can not either embrace or lead to the performance of the\r\nconditions. He has already discharged the only part in his power by the\r\nrecommendation in his annual message. The rest is with Congress and the\r\npeople, and until they have acted his duty will require him to look to\r\nthe existing state of things and act under them according to his high\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nBy these various proceedings, therefore, the State of South Carolina has\r\nforced the General Government, unavoidably, to decide the new and\r\ndangerous alternative of permitting a State to obstruct the execution of\r\nthe laws within its limits or seeing it attempt to execute a threat of\r\nwithdrawing from the Union. That portion of the people at present\r\nexercising the authority of the State solemnly assert their right to do\r\neither and as solemnly announce their determination to do one or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, both purposes are to be regarded as revolutionary in\r\ntheir character and tendency, and subversive of the supremacy of the\r\nlaws and of the integrity of the Union. The result of each is the same,\r\nsince a State in which, by an usurpation of power, the constitutional\r\nauthority of the Federal Government is openly defied and set aside wants\r\nonly the form to be independent of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will\r\nand without the consent of the other States from their most solemn\r\nobligations, and hazard the liberties and happiness of the millions\r\ncomposing this Union, can not be acknowledged. Such authority is\r\nbelieved to be utterly repugnant both to the principles upon which the\r\nGeneral Government is constituted and to the objects which it is\r\nexpressly formed to attain.\r\n\r\nAgainst all acts which may be alleged to transcend the constitutional\r\npower of the Government, or which may be inconvenient or oppressive in\r\ntheir operation, the Constitution itself has prescribed the modes of\r\nredress. It is the acknowledged attribute of free institutions that\r\nunder them the empire of reason and law is substituted for the power of\r\nthe sword. To no other source can appeals for supposed wrongs be made\r\nconsistently with the obligations of South Carolina; to no other can\r\nsuch appeals be made with safety at any time; and to their decisions,\r\nwhen constitutionally pronounced, it becomes the duty no less of the\r\npublic authorities than of the people in every case to yield a patriotic\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nThat a State or any other great portion of the people, suffering under\r\nlong and intolerable oppression and having tried all constitutional\r\nremedies without the hope of redress, may have a natural right, when\r\ntheir happiness can be no otherwise secured, and when they can do so\r\nwithout greater injury to others, to absolve themselves from their\r\nobligations to the Government and appeal to the last resort, needs not\r\non the present occasion be denied.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this right, however, must depend upon the causes which\r\nmay justify its exercise. It is the _ultima ratio_, which presupposes\r\nthat the proper appeals to all other means of redress have been made in\r\ngood faith, and which can never be rightfully resorted to unless it be\r\nunavoidable. It is not the right of the State, but of the individual,\r\nand of all the individuals in the State. It is the right of mankind\r\ngenerally to secure by all means in their power the blessings of liberty\r\nand happiness; but when for these purposes any body of men have\r\nvoluntarily associated themselves under a particular form of government,\r\nno portion of them can dissolve the association without acknowledging\r\nthe correlative right in the remainder to decide whether that\r\ndissolution can be permitted consistently with the general happiness. In\r\nthis view it is a right dependent upon the power to enforce it. Such a\r\nright, though it may be admitted to preexist and can not be wholly\r\nsurrendered, is necessarily subjected to limitations in all free\r\ngovernments, and in compacts of all kinds freely and voluntarily entered\r\ninto, and in which the interest and welfare of the individual become\r\nidentified with those of the community of which he is a member. In\r\ncompacts between individuals, however deeply they may affect their\r\nrelations, these principles are acknowledged to create a sacred\r\nobligation; and in compacts of civil government, involving the liberties\r\nand happiness of millions of mankind, the obligation can not be less.\r\n\r\nWithout adverting to the particular theories to which the federal\r\ncompact has given rise, both as to its formation and the parties to it,\r\nand without inquiring whether it be merely federal or social or\r\nnational, it is sufficient that it must be admitted to be a compact and\r\nto possess the obligations incident to a compact; to be \"a compact by\r\nwhich power is created on the one hand and obedience exacted on the\r\nother; a compact freely, voluntarily, and solemnly entered into by the\r\nseveral States and ratified by the people thereof, respectively; a\r\ncompact by which the several States and the people thereof,\r\nrespectively, have bound themselves to each other and to the Federal\r\nGovernment, and by which the Federal Government is bound to the several\r\nStates and to every citizen of the United States.\" To this compact, in\r\nwhatever mode it may have been done, the people of South Carolina have\r\nfreely and voluntarily given their assent, and to the whole and every\r\npart of it they are, upon every principle of good faith, inviolably\r\nbound. Under this obligation they are bound and should be required to\r\ncontribute their portion of the public expense, and to submit to all\r\nlaws made by the common consent, in pursuance of the Constitution, for\r\nthe common defense and general welfare, until they can be changed in the\r\nmode which the compact has provided for the attainment of those great\r\nends of the Government and of the Union. Nothing less than causes which\r\nwould justify revolutionary remedy can absolve the people from this\r\nobligation, and for nothing less can the Government permit it to be done\r\nwithout violating its own obligations, by which, under the compact, it\r\nis bound to the other States and to every citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese deductions plainly flow from the nature of the federal compact,\r\nwhich is one of limitations, not only upon the powers originally\r\npossessed by the parties thereto, but also upon those conferred on the\r\nGovernment and every department thereof. It will be freely conceded that\r\nby the principles of our system all power is vested in the people, but\r\nto be exercised in the mode and subject to the checks which the people\r\nthemselves have prescribed. These checks are undoubtedly only different\r\nmodifications of the same great popular principle which lies at the\r\nfoundation of the whole, but are not on that account to be less regarded\r\nor less obligatory.\r\n\r\nUpon the power of Congress, the veto of the Executive and the authority\r\nof the judiciary, which is to extend to all cases in law and equity\r\narising under the Constitution and laws of the United States made in\r\npursuance thereof, are the obvious checks, and the sound action of\r\npublic opinion, with the ultimate power of amendment, are the salutary\r\nand only limitation upon the powers of the whole.\r\n\r\nHowever it may be alleged that a violation of the compact by the\r\nmeasures of the Government can affect the obligations of the parties, it\r\ncan not even be pretended that such violation can be predicated of those\r\nmeasures until all the constitutional remedies shall have been fully\r\ntried. If the Federal Government exercise powers not warranted by the\r\nConstitution, and immediately affecting individuals, it will scarcely be\r\ndenied that the proper remedy is a recourse to the judiciary. Such\r\nundoubtedly is the remedy for those who deem the acts of Congress laying\r\nduties and imposts, and providing for their collection, to be\r\nunconstitutional. The whole operation of such laws is upon the\r\nindividuals importing the merchandise. A State is absolutely prohibited\r\nfrom laying imposts or duties on imports or exports without the consent\r\nof Congress, and can not become a party under these laws without\r\nimporting in her own name or wrongfully interposing her authority\r\nagainst them. By thus interposing, however, she can not rightfully\r\nobstruct the operation of the laws upon individuals. For their\r\ndisobedience to or violation of the laws the ordinary remedies through\r\nthe judicial tribunals would remain. And in a case where an individual\r\nshould be prosecuted for any offense against the laws, he could not set\r\nup in justification of his act a law of the State, which, being\r\nunconstitutional, would therefore be regarded as null and void. The law\r\nof a State can not authorize the commission of a crime against the\r\nUnited States or any other act which, according to the supreme law of\r\nthe Union, would be otherwise unlawful; and it is equally clear that if\r\nthere be any case in which a State, as such, is affected by the law\r\nbeyond the scope of judicial power, the remedy consists in appeals to\r\nthe people, either to effect a change in the representation or to\r\nprocure relief by an amendment of the Constitution. But the measures of\r\nthe Government are to be recognized as valid, and consequently supreme,\r\nuntil these remedies shall have been effectually tried, and any attempt\r\nto subvert those measures or to render the laws subordinate to State\r\nauthority, and afterwards to resort to constitutional redress, is worse\r\nthan evasive. It would not be a proper resistance to \"_a government of\r\nunlimited powers_,\" as has been sometimes pretended, but unlawful\r\nopposition to the very limitations on which the harmonious action of the\r\nGovernment and all its parts absolutely depends. South Carolina has\r\nappealed to none of these remedies, but in effect has defied them all.\r\nWhile threatening to separate from the Union if any attempt be made to\r\nenforce the revenue laws otherwise than through the civil tribunals of\r\nthe country, she has not only not appealed in her own name to those\r\ntribunals which the Constitution has provided for all cases in law or\r\nequity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, but\r\nhas endeavored to frustrate their proper action on her citizens by\r\ndrawing the cognizance of cases under the revenue laws to her own\r\ntribunals, specially prepared and fitted for the purpose of enforcing\r\nthe acts passed by the State to obstruct those laws, and both the judges\r\nand jurors of which will be bound by the import of oaths previously\r\ntaken to treat the Constitution and laws of the United States in this\r\nrespect as a nullity. Nor has the State made the proper appeal to public\r\nopinion and to the remedy of amendment; for without waiting to learn\r\nwhether the other States will consent to a convention, or if they do\r\nwill construe or amend the Constitution to suit her views, she has of\r\nher own authority altered the import of that instrument and given\r\nimmediate effect to the change. In fine, she has set her own will and\r\nauthority above the laws, has made herself arbiter in her own cause, and\r\nhas passed at once over all intermediate steps to measures of avowed\r\nresistance, which, unless they be submitted to, can be enforced only by\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\nIn deciding upon the course which a high sense of duty to all the people\r\nof the United States imposes upon the authorities of the Union in this\r\nemergency, it can not be overlooked that there is no sufficient cause\r\nfor the acts of South Carolina, or for her thus placing in jeopardy the\r\nhappiness of so many millions of people. Misrule and oppression, to\r\nwarrant the disruption of the free institutions of the Union of these\r\nStates, should be great and lasting, defying all other remedy. For\r\ncauses of minor character the Government could not submit to such a\r\ncatastrophe without a violation of its most sacred obligations to the\r\nother States of the Union who have submitted their destiny to its hands.\r\n\r\nThere is in the present instance no such cause, either in the degree of\r\nmisrule or oppression complained of or in the hopelessness of redress by\r\nconstitutional means. The long sanction they have received from the\r\nproper authorities and from the people, not less than the unexampled\r\ngrowth and increasing prosperity of so many millions of freemen, attest\r\nthat no such oppression as would justify, or even palliate, such a\r\nresort can be justly imputed either to the present policy or past\r\nmeasures of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThe same mode of collecting duties, and for the same general objects,\r\nwhich began with the foundation of the Government, and which has\r\nconducted the country through its subsequent steps to its present\r\nenviable condition of happiness and renown, has not been changed.\r\nTaxation and representation, the great principle of the American\r\nRevolution, have continually gone hand in hand, and at all times and in\r\nevery instance no tax of any kind has been imposed without their\r\nparticipation, and, in some instances which have been complained of,\r\nwith the express assent of a part of the representatives of South\r\nCarolina in the councils of the Government. Up to the present period no\r\nrevenue has been raised beyond the necessary wants of the country and\r\nthe authorized expenditures of the Government; and as soon as the\r\nburthen of the public debt is removed those charged with the\r\nadministration have promptly recommended a corresponding reduction of\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThat this system thus pursued has resulted in no such oppression upon\r\nSouth Carolina needs no other proof than the solemn and official\r\ndeclaration of the late chief magistrate of that State in his address to\r\nthe legislature. In that he says that--\r\n\r\n    The occurrences of the past year, in connection with our domestic\r\n    concerns, are to be reviewed with a sentiment of fervent gratitude\r\n    to the Great Disposer of Human Events; that tributes of grateful\r\n    acknowledgment are due for the various and multiplied blessings He\r\n    has been pleased to bestow on our people; that abundant harvests in\r\n    every quarter of the State have crowned the exertions of\r\n    agricultural labor; that health almost beyond former precedent has\r\n    blessed our homes, and that there is not less reason for\r\n    thankfulness in surveying our social condition.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed be difficult to imagine oppression where in the social\r\ncondition of a people there was equal cause of thankfulness as for\r\nabundant harvests and varied and multiplied blessings with which a kind\r\nProvidence had favored them.\r\n\r\nIndependently of these considerations, it will not escape observation\r\nthat South Carolina still claims to be a component part of the Union, to\r\nparticipate in the national councils and to share in the public benefits\r\nwithout contributing to the public burdens, thus asserting the dangerous\r\nanomaly of continuing in an association without acknowledging any other\r\nobligation to its laws than what depends upon her own will.\r\n\r\nIn this posture of affairs the duty of the Government seems to be plain.\r\nIt inculcates a recognition of that State as a member of the Union and\r\nsubject to its authority, a vindication of the just power of the\r\nConstitution, the preservation of the integrity of the Union, and the\r\nexecution of the laws by all constitutional means.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, which his oath of office obliges him to support,\r\ndeclares that the Executive \"_shall take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed_\" and in providing that he shall from time to time\r\ngive to Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to\r\ntheir consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and\r\nexpedient, imposes the additional obligation of recommending to Congress\r\nsuch more efficient provision for executing the laws as may from time to\r\ntime be found requisite.\r\n\r\nThe same instrument confers on Congress the power not merely to lay and\r\ncollect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and\r\nprovide for the common defense and general welfare, but \"to make all\r\nlaws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into effect the\r\nforegoing powers and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the\r\nGovernment of the United States or in any department or officer\r\nthereof,\" and also to provide for calling forth the militia for\r\nexecuting the laws of the Union. In all cases similar to the present the\r\nduties of the Government become the measure of its powers, and whenever\r\nit fails to exercise a power necessary and proper to the discharge of\r\nthe duty prescribed by the Constitution it violates the public trusts\r\nnot less than it would in transcending its proper limits. To refrain,\r\ntherefore, from the high and solemn duties thus enjoined, however\r\npainful the performance may be, and thereby tacitly permit the rightful\r\nauthority of the Government to be contemned and its laws obstructed by a\r\nsingle State, would neither comport with its own safety nor the rights\r\nof the great body of the American people.\r\n\r\nIt being thus shown to be the duty of the Executive to execute the laws\r\nby all constitutional means, it remains to consider the extent of those\r\nalready at his disposal and what it may be proper further to provide.\r\n\r\nIn the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury to the collectors\r\nin South Carolina the provisions and regulations made by the act of\r\n1799, and also the fines, penalties, and forfeitures for their\r\nenforcement, are particularly detailed and explained. It may be well\r\napprehended, however, that these provisions may prove inadequate to meet\r\nsuch an open, powerful, organized opposition as is to be commenced after\r\nthe 1st of February next.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the date of these instructions and to the passage of the\r\nordinance, information has been received from sources entitled to be\r\nrelied on that owing to the popular excitement in the State and the\r\neffect of the ordinance declaring the execution of the revenue laws\r\nunlawful a sufficient number of persons in whom confidence might be\r\nplaced could not be induced to accept the office of inspector to oppose\r\nwith any probability of success the force which will no doubt be used\r\nwhen an attempt is made to remove vessels and their cargoes from the\r\ncustody of the officers of the customs, and, indeed, that it would be\r\nimpracticable for the collector, with the aid of any number of\r\ninspectors whom he may be authorized to employ, to preserve the custody\r\nagainst such an attempt.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the custom-house from Charleston to Castle Pinckney was\r\ndeemed a measure of necessary precaution, and though the authority to\r\ngive that direction is not questioned, it is nevertheless apparent that\r\na similar precaution can not be observed in regard to the ports of\r\nGeorgetown and Beaufort, each of which under the present laws remains a\r\nport of entry and exposed to the obstructions meditated in that quarter.\r\n\r\nIn considering the best means of avoiding or of preventing the\r\napprehended obstruction to the collection of the revenue, and the\r\nconsequences which may ensue, it would appear to be proper and necessary\r\nto enable the officers of the customs to preserve the custody of vessels\r\nand their cargoes, which by the existing laws they are required to take,\r\nuntil the duties to which they are liable shall be paid or secured. The\r\nmode by which it is contemplated to deprive them of that custody is the\r\nprocess of replevin and that of _capias in withernam_, in the nature of\r\na distress from the State tribunals organized by the ordinance.\r\n\r\nAgainst the proceeding in the nature of a distress it is not perceived\r\nthat the collector can interpose any resistance whatever, and against\r\nthe process of replevin authorized by the law of the State he, having no\r\ncommon-law power, can only oppose such inspectors as he is by statute\r\nauthorized and may find it practicable to employ, and these, from the\r\ninformation already adverted to, are shown to be wholly inadequate,\r\n\r\nThe respect which that process deserves must therefore be considered.\r\n\r\nIf the authorities of South Carolina had not obstructed the legitimate\r\naction of the courts of the United States, or if they had permitted the\r\nState tribunals to administer the law according to their oath under the\r\nConstitution and the regulations of the laws of the Union, the General\r\nGovernment might have been content to look to them for maintaining the\r\ncustody and to encounter the other inconveniences arising out of the\r\nrecent proceedings. Even in that case, however, the process of replevin\r\nfrom the courts of the State would be irregular and unauthorized. It has\r\nbeen decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that the courts\r\nof the United States have exclusive jurisdiction of all seizures made on\r\nland or water for a breach of the laws of the United States, and any\r\nintervention of a State authority which, by taking the thing seized out\r\nof the hands of the United States officer, might obstruct the exercise\r\nof this jurisdiction is unlawful; that in such case the court of the\r\nUnited States having cognizance of the seizure may enforce a redelivery\r\nof the thing by attachment or other summary process; that the question\r\nunder such a seizure whether a forfeiture has been actually incurred\r\nbelongs exclusively to the courts of the United States, and it depends\r\non the final decree whether the seizure is to be deemed rightful or\r\ntortuous; and that not until the seizure be finally judged wrongful and\r\nwithout probable cause by the courts of the United States can the party\r\nproceed at common law for damages in the State courts.\r\n\r\nBut by making it \"unlawful for any of the constituted authorities,\r\nwhether of the United States or of the State, to enforce the laws for\r\nthe payment of duties, and declaring that all judicial proceedings which\r\nshall be hereafter had in affirmance of the contracts made with purpose\r\nto secure the duties imposed by the said acts are and shall be held\r\nutterly null and void,\" she has in effect abrogated the judicial\r\ntribunals within her limits in this respect, has virtually denied the\r\nUnited States access to the courts established by their own laws, and\r\ndeclared it unlawful for the judges to discharge those duties which they\r\nare sworn to perform. In lieu of these she has substituted those State\r\ntribunals already adverted to, the judges whereof are not merely\r\nforbidden to allow an appeal or permit a copy of their record, but are\r\npreviously sworn to disregard the laws of the Union and enforce those\r\nonly of South Carolina, and thus deprived of the function essential to\r\nthe judicial character of inquiring into the validity of the law and the\r\nright of the matter, become merely ministerial instruments in aid of the\r\nconcerted obstruction of the laws of the Union.\r\n\r\nNeither the process nor authority of these tribunals thus constituted\r\ncan be respected consistently with the supremacy of the laws or the\r\nrights and security of the citizen. If they be submitted to, the\r\nprotection due from the Government to its officers and citizens is\r\nwithheld, and there is at once an end not only to the laws, but to the\r\nUnion itself.\r\n\r\nAgainst such a force as the sheriff may, and which by the replevin law\r\nof South Carolina it is his duty to exercise, it can not be expected\r\nthat a collector can retain his custody with the aid of the inspectors.\r\nIn such case, it is true, it would be competent to institute suits in\r\nthe United States courts against those engaged in the unlawful\r\nproceeding, or the property might be seized for a violation of the\r\nrevenue laws, and, being libeled in the proper courts, an order might be\r\nmade for its redelivery, which would be committed to the marshal for\r\nexecution. But in that case the fourth section of the act, in broad and\r\nunqualified terms, makes it the duty of the sheriff \"to prevent such\r\nrecapture or seizure, or to redeliver the goods, as the case may be,\"\r\n\"even under any process, order, or decrees, or other pretext contrary to\r\nthe true intent and meaning of the ordinance aforesaid.\" It is thus made\r\nthe duty of the sheriff to oppose the process of the courts of the\r\nUnited States, and for that purpose, if need be, to employ the whole\r\npower of the county. And the act expressly reserves to him all power\r\nwhich, independently of its provisions, he could have used. In this\r\nreservation it obviously contemplates a resort to other means than those\r\nparticularly mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be disguised that the power which it is thus enjoined upon\r\nthe sheriff to employ is nothing less than the _posse comitatus_ in all\r\nthe rigor of the ancient common law. This power, though it may be used\r\nagainst unlawful resistance to judicial process, is in its character\r\nforcible, and analogous to that conferred upon the marshals by the act\r\nof 1795. It is, in fact, the embodying of the whole mass of the\r\npopulation, under the command of a single individual, to accomplish by\r\ntheir forcible aid what could not be effected peaceably and by the\r\nordinary means. It may properly be said to be a relic of those ages in\r\nwhich the laws could be defended rather by physical than moral force,\r\nand in its origin was conferred upon the sheriffs of England to enable\r\nthem to defend their county against any of the King's enemies when they\r\ncame into the land, as well as for the purpose of executing process. In\r\nearly and less civilized times it was intended to include \"the aid and\r\nattendance of all knights and others who were bound to have harness.\" It\r\nincludes the right of going with arms and military equipment, and\r\nembraces larger classes and greater masses of population than can be\r\ncompelled by the laws of most of the States to perform militia duty. If\r\nthe principles of the common law are recognized in South Carolina (and\r\nfrom this act it would seem they are), the power of summoning the _posse\r\ncomitatus_ will compel, under the penalty of fine and imprisonment,\r\nevery man over the age of 15, and able to travel, to turn out at the\r\ncall of the sheriff, and with such weapons as may be necessary; and it\r\nmay justify beating, and even killing, such as may resist. The use of\r\nthe _posse comitatus_ is therefore a direct application of force, and\r\ncan not be otherwise regarded than as the employment of the whole\r\nmilitia force of the county, and in an equally efficient form under a\r\ndifferent name. No proceeding which resorts to this power to the extent\r\ncontemplated by the act can be properly denominated peaceable.\r\n\r\nThe act of South Carolina, however, does not rely altogether upon this\r\nforcible remedy. For even attempting to resist or disobey, though by the\r\naid only of the ordinary officers of the customs, the process of\r\nreplevin, the collector and all concerned are subjected to a further\r\nproceeding in the nature of a distress of their personal effects, and\r\nare, moreover, made guilty of a misdemeanor, and liable to be punished\r\nby a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 and to\r\nimprisonment not exceeding two years and not less than six months; and\r\nfor even attempting to execute the order of the court for retaking the\r\nproperty the marshal and all assisting would be guilty of a misdemeanor\r\nand liable to a fine of not less than $3,000 nor more than $10,000 and\r\nto imprisonment not exceeding two years nor less than one: and in case\r\nthe goods should be retaken under such process it is made the absolute\r\nduty of the sheriff to retake them.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that in the face of these penalties, aided by\r\nthe powerful force of the county, which would doubtless be brought to\r\nsustain the State officers, either that the collector would retain the\r\ncustody in the first instance or that the marshal could summon\r\nsufficient aid to retake the property pursuant to the order or other\r\nprocess of the court.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, obvious that in this conflict between the powers of the\r\nofficers of the United States and of the State (unless the latter be\r\npassively submitted to) the destruction to which the property of the\r\nofficers of the customs would be exposed, the commission of actual\r\nviolence, and the loss of lives would be scarcely avoidable.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances and the provisions of the acts of South\r\nCarolina the execution of the laws is rendered impracticable even\r\nthrough the ordinary judicial tribunals of the United States. There\r\nwould certainly be fewer difficulties, and less opportunity of actual\r\ncollision between the officers of the United States and of the State,\r\nand the collection of the revenue would be more effectually secured--if,\r\nindeed, it can be done in any other way--by placing the custom-house\r\nbeyond the immediate power of the county.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose it might be proper to provide that whenever by any\r\nunlawful combination or obstruction in any State or in any port it\r\nshould become impracticable faithfully to collect the duties, the\r\nPresident of the United States should be authorized to alter and abolish\r\nsuch of the districts and ports of entry as should be necessary, and to\r\nestablish the custom-house at some secure place within some port or\r\nharbor of such State; and in such cases it should be the duty of the\r\ncollector to reside at such place, and to detain all vessels and cargoes\r\nuntil the duties imposed by law should be properly secured or paid in\r\ncash, deducting interest; that in such cases it should be unlawful to\r\ntake the vessel and cargo from the custody of the proper officer of the\r\ncustoms unless by process from the ordinary judicial tribunals of the\r\nUnited States, and that in case of an attempt otherwise to take the\r\nproperty by a force too great to be overcome by the officers of the\r\ncustoms it should be lawful to protect the possession of the officers by\r\nthe employment of the land and naval forces and militia, under\r\nprovisions similar to those authorized by the eleventh section of the\r\nact of the 9th of January, 1809.\r\n\r\nThis provision, however, would not shield the officers and citizens of\r\nthe United States, acting under the laws, from suits and prosecutions in\r\nthe tribunals of the State which might thereafter be brought against\r\nthem, nor would it protect their property from the proceeding by\r\ndistress, and it may well be apprehended that it would be insufficient\r\nto insure a proper respect to the process of the constitutional\r\ntribunals in prosecutions for offenses against the United States and to\r\nprotect the authorities of the United States, whether judicial or\r\nministerial, in the performance of their duties. It would, moreover, be\r\ninadequate to extend the protection due from the Government to that\r\nportion of the people of South Carolina against outrage and oppression\r\nof any kind who may manifest their attachment and yield obedience to the\r\nlaws of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be desirable to revive, with some modifications better\r\nadapted to the occasion, the sixth section of the act of the 3d March,\r\n1815, which expired on the 4th March, 1817, by the limitation of that of\r\n27th April, 1816, and to provide that in any case where suit shall be\r\nbrought against any individual in the courts of the State for any act\r\ndone under the laws of the United States he should be authorized to\r\nremove the said cause by petition into the circuit court of the United\r\nStates without any copy of the record, and that the court should proceed\r\nto hear and determine the same as if it had been originally instituted\r\ntherein; and that in all cases of injuries to the persons or property of\r\nindividuals for disobedience to the ordinance and laws of South Carolina\r\nin pursuance thereof redress may be sought in the courts of the United\r\nStates. It may be expedient also, by modifying the resolution of the 3d\r\nMarch, 1791, to authorize the marshals to make the necessary provision\r\nfor the safe-keeping of prisoners committed under the authority of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nProvisions less than these, consisting as they do for the most part\r\nrather of a revival of the policy of former acts called for by the\r\nexisting emergency than of the introduction of any unusual or rigorous\r\nenactments, would not cause the laws of the Union to be properly\r\nrespected or enforced. It is believed these would prove adequate unless\r\nthe military forces of the State of South Carolina authorized by the\r\nlate act of the legislature should be actually embodied and called out\r\nin aid of their proceedings and of the provisions of the ordinance\r\ngenerally. Even in that case, however, it is believed that no more will\r\nbe necessary than a few modifications of its terms to adapt the act of\r\n1795 to the present emergency, as by that act the provisions of the law\r\nof 1792 were accommodated to the crisis then existing, and by conferring\r\nauthority upon the President to give it operation during the session of\r\nCongress, and without the ceremony of a proclamation, whenever it shall\r\nbe officially made known to him by the authority of any State, or by the\r\ncourts of the United States, that within the limits of such State the\r\nlaws of the United States will be openly opposed and their execution\r\nobstructed by the actual employment of military force, or by any\r\nunlawful means whatsoever too great to be otherwise overcome.\r\n\r\nIn closing this communication, I should do injustice to my own feelings\r\nnot to express my confident reliance upon the disposition of each\r\ndepartment of the Government to perform its duty and to cooperate in all\r\nmeasures necessary in the present emergency.\r\n\r\nThe crisis undoubtedly invokes the fidelity of the patriot and the\r\nsagacity of the statesman, not more in removing such portion of the\r\npublic burden as may be necessary than in preserving the good order of\r\nsociety and in the maintenance of well-regulated liberty.\r\n\r\nWhile a forbearing spirit may, and I trust will, be exercised toward the\r\nerrors of our brethren in a particular quarter, duty to the rest of the\r\nUnion demands that open and organized resistance to the laws should not\r\nbe executed with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe rich inheritance bequeathed by our fathers has devolved upon us the\r\nsacred obligation of preserving it by the same virtues which conducted\r\nthem through the eventful scenes of the Revolution and ultimately\r\ncrowned their struggle with the noblest model of civil institutions.\r\nThey bequeathed to us a Government of laws and a Federal Union founded\r\nupon the great principle of popular representation. After a successful\r\nexperiment of forty-four years, at a moment when the Government and the\r\nUnion are the objects of the hopes of the friends of civil liberty\r\nthroughout the world, and in the midst of public and individual\r\nprosperity unexampled in history, we are called to decide whether these\r\nlaws possess any force and that Union the means of self-preservation.\r\nThe decision of this question by an enlightened and patriotic people can\r\nnot be doubtful. For myself, fellow-citizens, devoutly relying upon that\r\nkind Providence which has hitherto watched over our destinies, and\r\nactuated by a profound reverence for those institutions I have so much\r\ncause to love, and for the American people, whose partiality honored me\r\nwith their highest trust, I have determined to spare no effort to\r\ndischarge the duty which in this conjuncture is devolved upon me. That a\r\nsimilar spirit will actuate the representatives of the American people\r\nis not to be questioned; and I fervently pray that the Great Ruler of\r\nNations may so guide your deliberations and our joint measures as that\r\nthey may prove salutary examples not only to the present but to future\r\ntimes, and solemnly proclaim that the Constitution and the laws are\r\nsupreme and the _Union indissoluble_.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 16, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a resolution of the Senate of the 31st December last,\r\nI herewith transmit copies of the instructions under which the late\r\ntreaty of indemnity with Naples was negotiated, and of all the\r\ncorrespondence relative thereto.\r\n\r\nIt will appear evident from a perusal of some of those documents that\r\nthey are written by the agents of the United States to their own\r\nGovernment with a freedom, as far as relates to the officers of that of\r\nNaples, which was never intended for the public eye, and as they might,\r\nif printed, accidentally find their way abroad and thereby embarrass our\r\nministers in their future operations in foreign countries, I\r\nrespectfully recommend that in the printing, if deemed necessary, such a\r\ndiscrimination be made as to avoid that inconvenience, preferring this\r\ncourse to withholding from the Senate any part of the correspondence.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 17, 1833_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n11th December last, I herewith transmit \"such portions as have not\r\nheretofore been communicated of the instructions given to our ministers\r\nin France on the subject of claims for spoliations since September,\r\n1800, and of the correspondence of said ministers with the French\r\nGovernment and with the Secretary of State of the United States on the\r\nsame subject.\"\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 22, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHaving received on yesterday certified copies of the acts passed by the\r\nState of South Carolina to carry into effect her ordinance of\r\nnullification, which were referred to in my message of the 16th instant\r\nto Congress, I now transmit them.\r\n\r\nAs but one copy of these acts was sent to me, I am prevented from\r\ncommunicating them by a joint message to the two Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1833_.\r\n_The President of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace, friendship, and amity between the United States and\r\nthe King of the Belgians having this day been concluded by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the respective countries, I herewith transmit it to\r\nthe Senate for its consideration.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report of the Secretary of\r\nState, with a list of appointments made by the Executive since the 13th\r\nof April, 1826, from members of Congress during their term of service\r\nand for twelve months thereafter, pursuant to the resolution of the said\r\nHouse of the 26th of December, 1832, which I referred to him, and which\r\nappointments are recorded in his office. I send likewise a list of\r\nsimilar appointments, also furnished by the Secretary of State and of\r\nrecord in his office, from the 3d of March, 1825, to the 13th of April,\r\n1826.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_January 23, 1833_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send herewith a convention concluded on the 14th day of October last\r\nbetween the United States and His Majesty the King of the Two Sicilies.\r\nThis treaty has been ratified by me agreeably to the Constitution, and\r\nthe ratification will be dispatched to Naples without delay, when there\r\nis no doubt it will be ratified by His Sicilian Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe early communication of this treaty is deemed proper because it will\r\nbe necessary to provide for the execution of the first article in order\r\nthat our fellow-citizens may with as little delay as possible obtain the\r\ncompensation stipulated for by this convention.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_January 24, 1833_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 25, 1833_.\r\n_The Speaker of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of Congress, the report of the\r\nofficer to whom was intrusted the inspection of the works for the\r\nimprovement of the navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 29, 1833_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the\r\nPostmaster-General, which I request may be considered as forming a part\r\nof my message of the 23d instant, in answer to the resolution calling\r\nfor a list of all appointments made by the Executive since the 13th\r\nApril, 1826, from the members of Congress during their term of service\r\nand for twelve months thereafter, etc.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of Congress, a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, on the subject of our diplomatic intercourse with\r\nforeign nations.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate requesting the President\r\nof the United States to lay before it \"copies of the orders which have\r\nbeen given to the commanding officers of the military forces assembled\r\nin and near to the city of Charleston, S.C., and also copies of the\r\norders which have been given to the commander of the naval forces\r\nassembled in the harbor of Charleston, particularly such orders, if any\r\nsuch have been given, to resist the constituted authorities of the State\r\nof South Carolina within the limits of said State,\" I transmit herewith\r\npapers, numbered from 1 to 17, inclusive, embracing the orders which\r\nhave been given to the commanding officers of the land and naval forces\r\nassembled in and near the city of Charleston and within the limits of\r\nthe State of South Carolina, and which relate to the military operations\r\nin that quarter. No order has at any time been given in any manner\r\ninconsistent therewith. There is a part, however, of the letter of the\r\nSecretary of War dated December 3, 1832, omitted, which, being\r\nconditional in its character, and not relating to the operation of the\r\ntroops, it is deemed improper in the present state of the service to\r\ncommunicate.\r\n\r\nNo order has been at any time given \"to resist\" the constituted\r\nauthorities of the State of South Carolina within the chartered limits\r\nof said State.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their advice and consent as to\r\nthe ratification of the same, a treaty recently concluded between the\r\ncommissioners for adjusting all differences with the Indians west of the\r\nMississippi and the mixed band of Shawnese and Senecas who emigrated\r\nfrom Ohio. I transmit also the journal of their proceedings.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 15, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their advice and consent as to\r\nthe ratification of the same, articles of agreement supplemental to the\r\ntreaty of February 8, 1831, between the commissioner on the part of the\r\nUnited States and the Menominee tribe of Indians, with the assent of the\r\nNew York Indians.\r\n\r\nI transmit also the journal of proceedings.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 19, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe renomination of Samuel Gwin to be register of the land office at\r\nMount Salus, in the State of Mississippi, having been on the 16th of\r\nJuly last laid upon the table of the Senate, with a resolution declaring\r\nthat it was not the intention of the Senate to take any proceeding in\r\nregard to it during that session, a vacancy in the office was found\r\nexisting in the recess, which the public service required to be filled,\r\nand which was filled by the appointment of Samuel Gwin. I therefore\r\nnominate the said Gwin to the same office.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the papers which were transmitted with his nomination at\r\nthe last session, I have received others from the most respectable\r\nsources in the State of Mississippi, bearing the fullest testimony to\r\nhis fitness for the office in question. Of this character are the two\r\nnow inclosed, signed by members of the convention recently assembled to\r\nrevise the constitution of the State, and also by many members of its\r\npresent legislature. They also show that the appointment of Mr. Gwin\r\nwould be acceptable to the great body of the people interested in the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 22, 1833_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of the House, a letter from\r\nGeneral Lafayette to the Secretary of State, with the petition which\r\ncame inclosed in it of the Countess d'Ambrugeac and Madame de la Gorée,\r\ngranddaughter of Marshal Count Rochambeau, and original documents in\r\nsupport thereof, praying compensation for services rendered by the Count\r\nto the United States during the Revolutionary war, together with\r\ntranslations of the same; and I transmit with the same view the petition\r\nof Messrs. De Fontenille de Jeaumont and De Rossignol Grandmont, praying\r\ncompensation for services rendered by them to the United States in the\r\nFrench army, and during the same war, with original papers in support\r\nthereof, all received through the same channel, together with\r\ntranslations of the same.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 22, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its advice and consent as to the\r\nratification of the same, a treaty of commerce and navigation between\r\nthe United States and Russia, concluded and signed at St. Petersburg on\r\nthe 18th of December, 1832, by the plenipotentiaries of the two parties,\r\nwith an additional article to the same, concluded and signed on the same\r\nday, together with an extract from the dispatch of the minister of the\r\nUnited States at St. Petersburg to the Secretary of State, communicating\r\nthe said treaty and additional article.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate as to the\r\nratification of the same, a treaty concluded with the Ottawa Indians\r\nresiding on the Miami of Lake Erie on the 18th instant by the\r\ncommissioners on the part of the United States,\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the consideration of the Senate, a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, in relation to the consular establishment of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1833_.\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have made several nominations to offices located within the limits of\r\nthe State of Mississippi which have not received the approbation of the\r\nSenate. Inferring that these nominations have been rejected in pursuance\r\nof a resolution adopted by the Senate on the 3d of February, 1831, \"that\r\nit is inexpedient to appoint a citizen of one State to an office which\r\nmay be vacated or become vacant in any other State of the Union within\r\nwhich such citizen does not reside, without some evident necessity for\r\nsuch appointment,\" and regarding that resolution, in effect, as an\r\nunconstitutional restraint upon the authority of the President in\r\nrelation to appointments to office, I think it proper to inform the\r\nSenate that I shall feel it my duty to abstain from any further attempt\r\nto fill the offices in question.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The President of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate passed the 1st instant,\r\nrequesting \"that the President inform the Senate, if not incompatible\r\nwith the public interest, what negotiation has been had since the last\r\nsession of Congress with Great Britain in relation to the northeastern\r\nboundary of the United States, and the progress and result thereof; also\r\nwhether any arrangement, stipulation, or agreement has at any time been\r\nmade between the Executive of the United States and the government of\r\nthe State of Maine, or by commissioners or agents on the part of the\r\nUnited States and that State, having reference to any proposed transfer\r\nor relinquishment of their right of jurisdiction and territory belonging\r\nto that State, together with all documents, correspondence, and\r\ncommunications in relation thereto,\" I inform the Senate that overtures\r\nfor opening a negotiation for the settlement of the boundary between the\r\nUnited States and the British provinces have been made to the Government\r\nof Great Britain since the last session, but that no definitive answer\r\nhas yet been received to these propositions, and that a conditional\r\narrangement has been made between commissioners appointed by me and\r\nothers named by the governor of Maine, with the authority of its\r\nlegislature, which can not take effect without the sanction of Congress\r\nand of the legislature aforesaid, and which will be communicated to them\r\nas soon as the contingency in which alone it was intended to operate\r\nshall happen. In the meantime it is not deemed compatible with the\r\npublic interest that it should be communicated.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n_March 2, 1833_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Pocket vetoes.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1832_.\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this early opportunity to return to the Senate, in\r\nwhich it originated, the bill entitled \"An act providing for the final\r\nsettlement of the claims of States for interest on advances to the\r\nUnited States made during the last war,\" with the reasons which induced\r\nme to withhold my approbation, in consequence of which it has failed to\r\nbecome a law.\r\n\r\nThis bill was presented to me for my signature on the last day of your\r\nsession, and when I was compelled to consider a variety of other bills\r\nof greater urgency to the public service. It obviously embraced a\r\nprinciple in the allowance of interest different from that which had\r\nbeen sanctioned by the practice of the accounting officers or by the\r\nprevious legislation of Congress in regard to the advances by the\r\nStates, and without any apparent grounds for the change.\r\n\r\nPreviously to giving my sanction to so great an extension of the\r\npractice of allowing interest upon accounts with the Government, and\r\nwhich in its consequences and from analogy might not only call for large\r\npayments from the Treasury, but disturb the great mass of individual\r\naccounts long since finally settled, I deemed it my duty to make a more\r\nthorough investigation of the subject than it was possible for me to do\r\npreviously to the close of your last session. I adopted this course the\r\nmore readily from the consideration that as the bill contained no\r\nappropriation the States which would have been entitled to claim its\r\nbenefits could not have received them without the fuller legislation of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe principle which this bill authorizes varies not only from the\r\npractice uniformly adopted by many of the accounting officers in the\r\ncase of individual accounts and in those of the States finally settled\r\nand closed previously to your last session, but also from that pursued\r\nunder the act of your last session for the adjustment and settlement of\r\nthe claims of the State of South Carolina. This last act prescribed no\r\nparticular mode for the allowance of interest, which, therefore, in\r\nconformity with the directions of Congress in previous cases and with\r\nthe uniform practice of the Auditor by whom the account was settled, was\r\ncomputed on the sums expended by the State of South Carolina for the use\r\nand benefit of the United States, and which had been repaid to the\r\nState; and the payments made by the United States were deducted from the\r\nprincipal sums, exclusive of the interest, thereby stopping future\r\ninterest on so much of the principal as had been reimbursed by the\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nI deem it proper, moreover, to observe that both under the act of the\r\n5th of August, 1790, and that of the 12th of February, 1793, authorizing\r\nthe settlement of the accounts between the United States and the\r\nindividual States arising out of the war of the Revolution, the interest\r\non those accounts was computed in conformity with the practice already\r\nadverted to, and from which the bill now returned is a departure.\r\n\r\nWith these reasons and considerations I return the bill to the Senate.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December 6, 1832_.\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general views I have heretofore expressed to Congress\r\non the subject of internal improvement, it is my duty to advert to it\r\nagain in stating my objections to the bill entitled \"An act for the\r\nimprovement of certain harbors and the navigation of certain rivers,\"\r\nwhich was not received a sufficient time before the close of the last\r\nsession to enable me to examine it before the adjournment.\r\n\r\nHaving maturely considered that bill within the time allowed me by the\r\nConstitution, and being convinced that some of its provisions conflict\r\nwith the rule adopted for my guide on this subject of legislation, I\r\nhave been compelled to withhold from it my signature, and it has\r\ntherefore failed to become a law.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate as far as I can the intelligent action of Congress upon\r\nthe subjects embraced in this bill, I transmit herewith a report from\r\nthe Engineer Department, distinguishing, as far as the information\r\nwithin its possession would enable it, between those appropriations\r\nwhich do and those which do not conflict with the rules by which my\r\nconduct in this respect has hitherto been governed. By that report it\r\nwill be seen that there is a class of appropriations in the bill for the\r\nimprovement of streams that are not navigable, that are not channels of\r\ncommerce, and that do not pertain to the harbors or ports of entry\r\ndesignated by law, or have any ascertained connection with the usual\r\nestablishments for the security of commerce, external or internal.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that such appropriations involve the sanction of a\r\nprinciple that concedes to the General Government an unlimited power\r\nover the subject of internal improvements, and that I could not,\r\ntherefore, approve a bill containing them without receding from the\r\npositions taken in my veto of the Maysville road bill, and afterwards in\r\nmy annual message of December 6, 1830.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the rules by which the classification of the\r\nimprovements in this bill has been made by the Engineer Department are\r\nnot more definite and certain, and that embarrassments may not always be\r\navoided by the observance of them, but as neither my own reflection nor\r\nthe lights derived from other sources have furnished me with a better\r\nguide, I shall continue to apply my best exertions to their application\r\nand enforcement. In thus employing my best faculties to exercise the\r\npower with which I am invested to avoid evils and to effect the greatest\r\nattainable good for our common country I feel that I may trust to your\r\ncordial cooperation, and the experience of the past leaves me no room to\r\ndoubt the liberal indulgence and favorable consideration of those for\r\nwhom we act.\r\n\r\nThe grounds upon which I have given my assent to appropriations for the\r\nconstruction of light-houses, beacons, buoys, public piers, and the\r\nremoval of sand bars, sawyers, and other temporary or partial\r\nimpediments in our navigable rivers and harbors, and with which many of\r\nthe provisions of this bill correspond, have been so fully stated that I\r\ntrust a repetition of them is unnecessary. Had there been incorporated\r\nin the bill no provisions for works of a different description,\r\ndepending on principles which extend the power of making appropriations\r\nto every object which the discretion of the Government may select, and\r\nlosing sight of the distinctions between national and local character\r\nwhich I had stated would be my future guide on the subject, I should\r\nhave cheerfully signed the bill.\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nBY ANDREW JACKSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nWhereas a convention assembled in the State of South Carolina have\r\npassed an ordinance by which they declare \"that the several acts and\r\nparts of acts of the Congress of the United States purporting to be laws\r\nfor the imposing of duties and imposts on the importation of foreign\r\ncommodities, and now having actual operation and effect within the\r\nUnited States, and more especially\" two acts for the same purposes\r\npassed on the 29th of May, 1828, and on the 14th of July, 1832, \"are\r\nunauthorized by the Constitution of the United States, and violate the\r\ntrue meaning and intent thereof, and are null and void and no law,\" nor\r\nbinding on the citizens of that State or its officers; and by the said\r\nordinance it is further declared to be unlawful for any of the\r\nconstituted authorities of the State or of the United States to enforce\r\nthe payment of the duties imposed by the said acts within the same\r\nState, and that it is the duty of the legislature to pass such laws as\r\nmay be necessary to give full effect to the said ordinance; and\r\n\r\nWhereas by the said ordinance it is further ordained that in no case of\r\nlaw or equity decided in the courts of said State wherein shall be drawn\r\nin question the validity of the said ordinance, or of the acts of the\r\nlegislature that may be passed to give it effect, or of the said laws of\r\nthe United States, no appeal shall be allowed to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, nor shall any copy of the record be permitted or\r\nallowed for that purpose, and that any person attempting to take such\r\nappeal shall be punished as for contempt of court; and, finally, the\r\nsaid ordinance declares that the people of South Carolina will maintain\r\nthe said ordinance at every hazard, and that they will consider the\r\npassage of any act by Congress abolishing or closing the ports of the\r\nsaid State or otherwise obstructing the free ingress or egress of\r\nvessels to and from the said ports, or any other act of the Federal\r\nGovernment to coerce the State, shut up her ports, destroy or harass her\r\ncommerce, or to enforce the said acts otherwise than through the civil\r\ntribunals of the country, as inconsistent with the longer continuance of\r\nSouth Carolina in the Union, and that the people of the said State will\r\nthenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further obligation to\r\nmaintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the\r\nother States, and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate\r\ngovernment and do all other acts and things which sovereign and\r\nindependent states may of right do; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the said ordinance prescribes to the people of South Carolina a\r\ncourse of conduct in direct violation of their duty as citizens of the\r\nUnited States, contrary to the laws of their country, subversive of its\r\nConstitution, and having for its object the destruction of the\r\nUnion--that Union which, coeval with our political existence, led our\r\nfathers, without any other ties to unite them than those of patriotism\r\nand a common cause, through a sanguinary struggle to a glorious\r\nindependence; that sacred Union, hitherto inviolate, which, perfected by\r\nour happy Constitution, has brought us, by the favor of Heaven, to a\r\nstate of prosperity at home and high consideration abroad rarely, if\r\never, equaled in the history of nations:\r\n\r\nTo preserve this bond of our political existence from destruction, to\r\nmaintain inviolate this state of national honor and prosperity, and to\r\njustify the confidence my fellow-citizens have reposed in me, I, Andrew\r\nJackson, President of the United States, have thought proper to issue\r\nthis my proclamation, stating my views of the Constitution and laws\r\napplicable to the measures adopted by the convention of South Carolina\r\nand to the reasons they have put forth to sustain them, declaring the\r\ncourse which duty will require me to pursue, and, appealing to the\r\nunderstanding and patriotism of the people, warn them of the\r\nconsequences that must inevitably result from an observance of the\r\ndictates of the convention.\r\n\r\nStrict duty would require of me nothing more than the exercise of those\r\npowers with which I am now or may hereafter be invested for preserving\r\nthe peace of the Union and for the execution of the laws; but the\r\nimposing aspect which opposition has assumed in this case, by clothing\r\nitself with State authority, and the deep interest which the people of\r\nthe United States must all feel in preventing a resort to stronger\r\nmeasures while there is a hope that anything will be yielded to\r\nreasoning and remonstrance, perhaps demand, and will certainly justify,\r\na full exposition to South Carolina and the nation of the views I\r\nentertain of this important question, as well as a distinct enunciation\r\nof the course which my sense of duty will require me to pursue.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance is founded, not on the indefeasible right of resisting\r\nacts which are plainly unconstitutional and too oppressive to be\r\nendured, but on the strange position that any one State may not only\r\ndeclare an act of Congress void, but prohibit its execution; that they\r\nmay do this consistently with the Constitution; that the true\r\nconstruction of that instrument permits a State to retain its place in\r\nthe Union and yet be bound by no other of its laws than those it may\r\nchoose to consider as constitutional. It is true, they add, that to\r\njustify this abrogation of a law it must be palpably contrary to the\r\nConstitution; but it is evident that to give the right of resisting laws\r\nof that description, coupled with the uncontrolled right to decide what\r\nlaws deserve that character, is to give the power of resisting all laws;\r\nfor as by the theory there is no appeal, the reasons alleged by the\r\nState, good or bad, must prevail. If it should be said that public\r\nopinion is a sufficient check against the abuse of this power, it may be\r\nasked why it is not deemed a sufficient guard against the passage of an\r\nunconstitutional act by Congress? There is, however, a restraint in this\r\nlast case which makes the assumed power of a State more indefensible,\r\nand which does not exist in the other. There are two appeals from an\r\nunconstitutional act passed by Congress--one to the judiciary, the other\r\nto the people and the States. There is no appeal from the State decision\r\nin theory, and the practical illustration shows that the courts are\r\nclosed against an application to review it, both judges and jurors being\r\nsworn to decide in its favor. But reasoning on this subject is\r\nsuperfluous when our social compact, in express terms, declares that the\r\nlaws of the United States, its Constitution, and treaties made under it\r\nare the supreme law of the land, and, for greater caution, adds \"that\r\nthe judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the\r\nconstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\" And\r\nit may be asserted without fear of refutation that no federative\r\ngovernment could exist without a similar provision. Look for a moment to\r\nthe consequence. If South Carolina considers the revenue laws\r\nunconstitutional and has a right to prevent their execution in the port\r\nof Charleston, there would be a clear constitutional objection to their\r\ncollection in every other port; and no revenue could be collected\r\nanywhere, for all imposts must be equal. It is no answer to repeat that\r\nan unconstitutional law is no law so long as the question of its\r\nlegality is to be decided by the State itself, for every law operating\r\ninjuriously upon any local interest will be perhaps thought, and\r\ncertainly represented, as unconstitutional, and, as has been shown,\r\nthere is no appeal.\r\n\r\nIf this doctrine had been established at an earlier day, the Union would\r\nhave been dissolved in its infancy. The excise law in Pennsylvania, the\r\nembargo and nonintercourse law in the Eastern States, the carriage tax\r\nin Virginia, were all deemed unconstitutional, and were more unequal in\r\ntheir operation than any of the laws now complained of; but,\r\nfortunately, none of those States discovered that they had the right now\r\nclaimed by South Carolina. The war into which we were forced to support\r\nthe dignity of the nation and the rights of our citizens might have\r\nended in defeat and disgrace, instead of victory and honor, if the\r\nStates who supposed it a ruinous and unconstitutional measure had\r\nthought they possessed the right of nullifying the act by which it was\r\ndeclared and denying supplies for its prosecution. Hardly and unequally\r\nas those measures bore upon several members of the Union, to the\r\nlegislatures of none did this efficient and peaceable remedy, as it is\r\ncalled, suggest itself. The discovery of this important feature in our\r\nConstitution was reserved to the present day. To the statesmen of South\r\nCarolina belongs the invention, and upon the citizens of that State will\r\nunfortunately fall the evils of reducing it to practice.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine of a State veto upon the laws of the Union carries with\r\nit internal evidence of its impracticable absurdity, our constitutional\r\nhistory will also afford abundant proof that it would have been\r\nrepudiated with indignation had it been proposed to form a feature in\r\nour Government.\r\n\r\nIn our colonial state, although dependent on another power, we very\r\nearly considered ourselves as connected by common interest with each\r\nother. Leagues were formed for common defense, and before the\r\ndeclaration of independence we were known in our aggregate character as\r\n_the United Colonies of America_. That decisive and important step was\r\ntaken jointly. We declared ourselves a nation by a joint, not by several\r\nacts, and when the terms of our Confederation were reduced to form it\r\nwas in that of a solemn league of several States, by which they agreed\r\nthat they would collectively form one nation for the purpose of\r\nconducting some certain domestic concerns and all foreign relations. In\r\nthe instrument forming that Union is found an article which declares\r\nthat \"every State shall abide by the determinations of Congress on all\r\nquestions which by that Confederation should be submitted to them.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the Confederation, then, no State could legally annul a decision\r\nof the Congress or refuse to submit to its execution; but no provision\r\nwas made to enforce these decisions. Congress made requisitions, but\r\nthey were not complied with. The Government could not operate on\r\nindividuals. They had no judiciary, no means of collecting revenue.\r\n\r\nBut the defects of the Confederation need not be detailed. Under its\r\noperation we could scarcely be called a nation. We had neither\r\nprosperity at home nor consideration abroad. This state of things could\r\nnot be endured, and our present happy Constitution was formed, but\r\nformed in vain if this fatal doctrine prevails. It was formed for\r\nimportant objects that are announced in the preamble, made in the name\r\nand by the authority of the people of the United States, whose delegates\r\nframed and whose conventions approved it. The most important among these\r\nobjects--that which is placed first in rank, on which all the others\r\nrest--is \"_to form a more perfect union_.\" Now, is it possible that even\r\nif there were no express provision giving supremacy to the Constitution\r\nand laws of the United States over those of the States, can it be\r\nconceived that an instrument made for the purpose of \"_forming a more\r\nperfect union_\" than that of the Confederation could be so constructed\r\nby the assembled wisdom of our country as to substitute for that\r\nConfederation a form of government dependent for its existence on the\r\nlocal interest, the party spirit, of a State, or of a prevailing faction\r\nin a State? Every man of plain, unsophisticated understanding who hears\r\nthe question will give such an answer as will preserve the Union.\r\nMetaphysical subtlety, in pursuit of an impracticable theory, could\r\nalone have devised one that is calculated to destroy it.\r\n\r\nI consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed\r\nby one State, _incompatible with the existence of the Union,\r\ncontradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorised\r\nby its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was\r\nfounded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed_.\r\n\r\nAfter this general view of the leading principle, we must examine the\r\nparticular application of it which is made in the ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe preamble rests its justification on these grounds: It assumes as a\r\nfact that the obnoxious laws, although they purport to be laws for\r\nraising revenue, were in reality intended for the protection of\r\nmanufactures, which purpose it asserts to be unconstitutional; that the\r\noperation of these laws is unequal; that the amount raised by them is\r\ngreater than is required by the wants of the Government; and, finally,\r\nthat the proceeds are to be applied to objects unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution. These are the only causes alleged to justify an open\r\nopposition to the laws of the country and a threat of seceding from the\r\nUnion if any attempt should be made to enforce them. The first virtually\r\nacknowledges that the law in question was passed under a power expressly\r\ngiven by the Constitution to lay and collect imposts; but its\r\nconstitutionality is drawn in question from the _motives_ of those who\r\npassed it. However apparent this purpose may be in the present case,\r\nnothing can be more dangerous than to admit the position that an\r\nunconstitutional purpose entertained by the members who assent to a law\r\nenacted under a constitutional power shall make that law void. For how\r\nis that purpose to be ascertained? Who is to make the scrutiny? How\r\noften may bad purposes be falsely imputed, in how many cases are they\r\nconcealed by false professions, in how many is no declaration of motive\r\nmade? Admit this doctrine, and you give to the States an uncontrolled\r\nright to decide, and every law may be annulled under this pretext. If,\r\ntherefore, the absurd and dangerous doctrine should be admitted that a\r\nState may annul an unconstitutional law, or one that it deems such, it\r\nwill not apply to the present case.\r\n\r\nThe next objection is that the laws in question operate unequally. This\r\nobjection may be made with truth to every law that has been or can be\r\npassed. The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that\r\nwould operate with perfect equality. If the unequal operation of a law\r\nmakes it unconstitutional, and if all laws of that description may be\r\nabrogated by any State for that cause, then, indeed, is the Federal\r\nConstitution unworthy of the slightest effort for its preservation. We\r\nhave hitherto relied on it as the perpetual bond of our Union; we have\r\nreceived it as the work of the assembled wisdom of the nation; we have\r\ntrusted to it as to the sheet anchor of our safety in the stormy times\r\nof conflict with a foreign or domestic foe; we have looked to it with\r\nsacred awe as the palladium of our liberties, and with all the\r\nsolemnities of religion have pledged to each other our lives and\r\nfortunes here and our hopes of happiness hereafter in its defense and\r\nsupport. Were we mistaken, my countrymen, in attaching this importance\r\nto the Constitution of our country? Was our devotion paid to the\r\nwretched, inefficient, clumsy contrivance which this new doctrine would\r\nmake it? Did we pledge ourselves to the support of an airy nothing--a\r\nbubble that must be blown away by the first breath of disaffection? Was\r\nthis self-destroying, visionary theory the work of the profound\r\nstatesmen, the exalted patriots, to whom the task of constitutional\r\nreform was intrusted? Did the name of Washington sanction, did the\r\nStates deliberately ratify, such an anomaly in the history of\r\nfundamental legislation? No; we were not mistaken. The letter of this\r\ngreat instrument is free from this radical fault. Its language directly\r\ncontradicts the imputation; its spirit, its evident intent, contradicts\r\nit. No; we did not err. Our Constitution does not contain the absurdity\r\nof giving power to make laws and another to resist them. The sages whose\r\nmemory will always be reverenced have given us a practical and, as they\r\nhoped, a permanent constitutional compact. The Father of his Country did\r\nnot affix his revered name to so palpable an absurdity. Nor did the\r\nStates, when they severally ratified it, do so under the impression that\r\na veto on the laws of the United States was reserved to them or that\r\nthey could exercise it by implication. Search the debates in all their\r\nconventions, examine the speeches of the most zealous opposers of\r\nFederal authority, look at the amendments that were proposed; they are\r\nall silent--not a syllable uttered, not a vote given, not a motion made\r\nto correct the explicit supremacy given to the laws of the Union over\r\nthose of the States, or to show that implication, as is now contended,\r\ncould defeat it. No; we have not erred. The Constitution is still the\r\nobject of our reverence, the bond of our Union, our defense in danger,\r\nthe source of our prosperity in peace. It shall descend, as we have\r\nreceived it, uncorrupted by sophistical construction, to our posterity;\r\nand the sacrifices of local interest, of State prejudices, of personal\r\nanimosities, that were made to bring it into existence, will again be\r\npatriotically offered for its support.\r\n\r\nThe two remaining objections made by the ordinance to these laws are\r\nthat the sums intended to be raised by them are greater than are\r\nrequired and that the proceeds will be unconstitutionally employed.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has given, expressly, to Congress the right of raising\r\nrevenue and of determining the sum the public exigencies will require.\r\nThe States have no control over the exercise of this right other than\r\nthat which results from the power of changing the representatives who\r\nabuse it, and thus procure redress. Congress may undoubtedly abuse this\r\ndiscretionary power; but the same may be said of others with which they\r\nare vested. Yet the discretion must exist somewhere. The Constitution\r\nhas given it to the representatives of all the people, checked by the\r\nrepresentatives of the States and by the Executive power. The South\r\nCarolina construction gives it to the legislature or the convention of a\r\nsingle State, where neither the people of the different States, nor the\r\nStates in their separate capacity, nor the Chief Magistrate elected by\r\nthe people have any representation. Which is the most discreet\r\ndisposition of the power? I do not ask you, fellow-citizens, which is\r\nthe constitutional disposition; that instrument speaks a language not to\r\nbe misunderstood. But if you were assembled in general convention, which\r\nwould you think the safest depository of this discretionary power in the\r\nlast resort? Would you add a clause giving it to each of the States, or\r\nwould you sanction the wise provisions already made by your\r\nConstitution? If this should be the result of your deliberations when\r\nproviding for the future, are you, can you, be ready to risk all that we\r\nhold dear, to establish, for a temporary and a local purpose, that which\r\nyou must acknowledge to be destructive, and even absurd, as a general\r\nprovision? Carry out the consequences of this right vested in the\r\ndifferent States, and you must perceive that the crisis your conduct\r\npresents at this day would recur whenever any law of the United States\r\ndispleased any of the States, and that we should soon cease to be a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance, with the same knowledge of the future that characterizes\r\na former objection, tells you that the proceeds of the tax will be\r\nunconstitutionally applied. If this could be ascertained with certainty,\r\nthe objection would with more propriety be reserved for the law so\r\napplying the proceeds, but surely can not be urged against the laws\r\nlevying the duty.\r\n\r\nThese are the allegations contained in the ordinance. Examine them\r\nseriously, my fellow-citizens; judge for yourselves. I appeal to you to\r\ndetermine whether they are so clear, so convincing, as to leave no doubt\r\nof their correctness; and even if you should come to this conclusion,\r\nhow far they justify the reckless, destructive course which you are\r\ndirected to pursue. Review these objections and the conclusions drawn\r\nfrom them once more. What are they? Every law, then, for raising\r\nrevenue, according to the South Carolina ordinance, may be rightfully\r\nannulled, unless it be so framed as no law ever will or can be framed.\r\nCongress have a right to pass laws for raising revenue and each State\r\nhave a right to oppose their execution--two rights directly opposed to\r\neach other; and yet is this absurdity supposed to be contained in an\r\ninstrument drawn for the express purpose of avoiding collisions between\r\nthe States and the General Government by an assembly of the most\r\nenlightened statesmen and purest patriots ever embodied for a similar\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIn vain have these sages declared that Congress shall have power to lay\r\nand collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; in vain have they\r\nprovided that they shall have power to pass laws which shall be\r\nnecessary and proper to carry those powers into execution, that those\r\nlaws and that Constitution shall be the \"supreme law of the land, and\r\nthat the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the\r\nconstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding;\" in\r\nvain have the people of the several States solemnly sanctioned these\r\nprovisions, made them their paramount law, and individually sworn to\r\nsupport them whenever they were called on to execute any office. Vain\r\nprovisions! ineffectual restrictions! vile profanation of oaths!\r\nmiserable mockery of legislation! if a bare majority of the voters in\r\nany one State may, on a real or supposed knowledge of the intent with\r\nwhich a law has been passed, declare themselves free from its operation;\r\nsay, here it gives too little; there, too much, and operates unequally;\r\nhere it suffers articles to be free that ought to be taxed; there it\r\ntaxes those that ought to be free; in this case the proceeds are\r\nintended to be applied to purposes which we do not approve; in that, the\r\namount raised is more than is wanted. Congress, it is true, are invested\r\nby the Constitution with the right of deciding these questions according\r\nto their sound discretion. Congress is composed of the representatives\r\nof all the States and of all the people of all the States. But _we_,\r\npart of the people of one State, to whom the Constitution has given no\r\npower on the subject, from whom it has expressly taken it away; _we_,\r\nwho have solemnly agreed that this Constitution shall be our law; _we_,\r\nmost of whom have sworn to support it--_we_ now abrogate this law and\r\nswear, and force others to swear, that it shall not be obeyed; and we do\r\nthis not because Congress have no right to pass such laws--this we do\r\nnot allege--but because they have passed them with improper views. They\r\nare unconstitutional from the motives of those who passed them, which we\r\ncan never with certainty know; from their unequal operation, although it\r\nis impossible, from the nature of things, that they should be equal; and\r\nfrom the disposition which we presume may be made of their proceeds,\r\nalthough that disposition has not been declared. This is the plain\r\nmeaning of the ordinance in relation to laws which it abrogates for\r\nalleged unconstitutionality. But it does not stop there. It repeals in\r\nexpress terms an important part of the Constitution itself and of laws\r\npassed to give it effect, which have never been alleged to be\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution declares that the judicial powers of the United States\r\nextend to cases arising under the laws of the United States, and that\r\nsuch laws, the Constitution, and treaties shall be paramount to the\r\nState constitutions and laws. The judiciary act prescribes the mode by\r\nwhich the case may be brought before a court of the United States by\r\nappeal when a State tribunal shall decide against this provision of the\r\nConstitution. The ordinance declares there shall be no appeal--makes the\r\nState law paramount to the Constitution and laws of the United States,\r\nforces judges and jurors to swear that they will disregard their\r\nprovisions, and even makes it penal in a suitor to attempt relief by\r\nappeal. It further declares that it shall not be lawful for the\r\nauthorities of the United States or of that State to enforce the payment\r\nof duties imposed by the revenue laws within its limits.\r\n\r\nHere is a law of the United States, not even pretended to be\r\nunconstitutional, repealed by the authority of a small majority of the\r\nvoters of a single State. Here is a provision of the Constitution which\r\nis solemnly abrogated by the same authority.\r\n\r\nOn such expositions and reasonings the ordinance grounds not only an\r\nassertion of the right to annul the laws of which it complains, but to\r\nenforce it by a threat of seceding from the Union if any attempt is made\r\nto execute them.\r\n\r\nThis right to secede is deduced from the nature of the Constitution,\r\nwhich, they say, is a compact between sovereign States who have\r\npreserved their whole sovereignty and therefore are subject to no\r\nsuperior; that because they made the compact they can break it when in\r\ntheir opinion it has been departed from by the other States. Fallacious\r\nas this course of reasoning is, it enlists State pride and finds\r\nadvocates in the honest prejudices of those who have not studied the\r\nnature of our Government sufficiently to see the radical error on which\r\nit rests.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States formed the Constitution, acting through\r\nthe State legislatures in making the compact, to meet and discuss its\r\nprovisions, and acting in separate conventions when they ratified those\r\nprovisions; but the terms used in its construction show it to be a\r\nGovernment in which the people of all the States, collectively, are\r\nrepresented. We are _one people_ in the choice of President and\r\nVice-President. Here the States have no other agency than to direct the\r\nmode in which the votes shall be given. The candidates having the\r\nmajority of all the votes are chosen. The electors of a majority of\r\nStates may have given their votes for one candidate, and yet another may\r\nbe chosen. The people, then, and not the States, are represented in the\r\nexecutive branch.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives there is this difference, that the\r\npeople of one State do not, as in the case of President and\r\nVice-President, all vote for the same officers. The people of all the\r\nStates do not vote for all the members, each State electing only its own\r\nrepresentatives. But this creates no material distinction. When chosen,\r\nthey are all representatives of the United States, not representatives\r\nof the particular State from which they come. They are paid by the\r\nUnited States, not by the State; nor are they accountable to it for any\r\nact done in the performance of their legislative functions; and however\r\nthey may in practice, as it is their duty to do, consult and prefer the\r\ninterests of their particular constituents when they come in conflict\r\nwith any other partial or local interest, yet it is their first and\r\nhighest duty, as representatives of the United States, to promote the\r\ngeneral good.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, then, forms a _government_, not a\r\nleague; and whether it be formed by compact between the States or in any\r\nother manner, its character is the same. It is a Government in which all\r\nthe people are represented, which operates directly on the people\r\nindividually, not upon the States; they retained all the power they did\r\nnot grant. But each State, having expressly parted with so many powers\r\nas to constitute, jointly with the other States, a single nation, can\r\nnot, from that period, possess any right to secede, because such\r\nsecession does not break a league, but destroys the unity of a nation;\r\nand any injury to that unity is not only a breach which would result\r\nfrom the contravention of a compact, but it is an offense against the\r\nwhole Union. To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union\r\nis to say that the United States are not a nation, because it would be a\r\nsolecism to contend that any part of a nation might dissolve its\r\nconnection with the other parts, to their injury or ruin, without\r\ncommitting any offense. Secession, like any other revolutionary act, may\r\nbe morally justified by the extremity of oppression, but to call it a\r\nconstitutional right is confounding the meaning of terms, and can only\r\nbe done through gross error or to deceive those who are willing to\r\nassert a right, but would pause before they made a revolution or incur\r\nthe penalties consequent on a failure.\r\n\r\nBecause the Union was formed by a compact, it is said the parties to\r\nthat compact may, when they feel themselves aggrieved, depart from it;\r\nbut it is precisely because it is a compact that they can not. A compact\r\nis an agreement or binding obligation. It may by its terms have a\r\nsanction or penalty for its breach, or it may not. If it contains no\r\nsanction, it may be broken with no other consequence than moral guilt;\r\nif it have a sanction, then the breach incurs the designated or implied\r\npenalty. A league between independent nations generally has no sanction\r\nother than a moral one; or if it should contain a penalty, as there is\r\nno common superior it can not be enforced. A government, on the\r\ncontrary, always has a sanction, express or implied; and in our case it\r\nis both necessarily implied and expressly given. An attempt, by force of\r\narms, to destroy a government is an offense, by whatever means the\r\nconstitutional compact may have been formed; and such government has the\r\nright by the law of self-defense to pass acts for punishing the\r\noffender, unless that right is modified, restrained, or resumed by the\r\nconstitutional act. In our system, although it is modified in the case\r\nof treason, yet authority is expressly given to pass all laws necessary\r\nto carry its powers into effect, and under this grant provision has been\r\nmade for punishing acts which obstruct the due administration of the\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nIt would seem superfluous to add anything to show the nature of that\r\nunion which connects us, but as erroneous opinions on this subject are\r\nthe foundation of doctrines the most destructive to our peace, I must\r\ngive some further development to my views on this subject. No one,\r\nfellow-citizens, has a higher reverence for the reserved rights of the\r\nStates than the Magistrate who now addresses you. No one would make\r\ngreater personal sacrifices or official exertions to defend them from\r\nviolation; but equal care must be taken to prevent, on their part, an\r\nimproper interference with or resumption of the rights they have vested\r\nin the nation. The line has not been so distinctly drawn as to avoid\r\ndoubts in some cases of the exercise of power. Men of the best\r\nintentions and soundest views may differ in their construction of some\r\nparts of the Constitution; but there are others on which dispassionate\r\nreflection can leave no doubt. Of this nature appears to be the assumed\r\nright of secession. It rests, as we have seen, on the alleged undivided\r\nsovereignty of the States and on their having formed in this sovereign\r\ncapacity a compact which is called the Constitution, from which, because\r\nthey made it, they have the right to secede. Both of these positions are\r\nerroneous, and some of the arguments to prove them so have been\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThe States severally have not retained their entire sovereignty. It has\r\nbeen shown that in becoming parts of a nation, not members of a league,\r\nthey surrendered many of their essential parts of sovereignty. The right\r\nto make treaties, declare war, levy taxes, exercise exclusive judicial\r\nand legislative powers, were all of them functions of sovereign power.\r\nThe States, then, for all these important purposes were no longer\r\nsovereign. The allegiance of their citizens was transferred, in the\r\nfirst instance, to the Government of the United States; they became\r\nAmerican citizens and owed obedience to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and to laws made in conformity with the powers it vested in\r\nCongress. This last position has not been and can not be denied. How,\r\nthen, can that State be said to be sovereign and independent whose\r\ncitizens owe obedience to laws not made by it and whose magistrates are\r\nsworn to disregard those laws when they come in conflict with those\r\npassed by another? What shows conclusively that the States can not be\r\nsaid to have reserved an undivided sovereignty is that they expressly\r\nceded the right to punish treason--not treason against their separate\r\npower, but treason against the United States. Treason is an offense\r\nagainst _sovereignty_, and sovereignty must reside with the power to\r\npunish it. But the reserved rights of the States are not less sacred\r\nbecause they have, for their common interest, made the General\r\nGovernment the depository of these powers. The unity of our political\r\ncharacter (as has been shown for another purpose) commenced with its\r\nvery existence. Under the royal Government we had no separate character;\r\nour opposition to its oppressions began as _united colonies_. We were\r\nthe _United States_ under the Confederation, and the name was\r\nperpetuated and the Union rendered more perfect by the Federal\r\nConstitution. In none of these stages did we consider ourselves in any\r\nother light than as forming one nation. Treaties and alliances were made\r\nin the name of all. Troops were raised for the joint defense. How, then,\r\nwith all these proofs that under all changes of our position we had, for\r\ndesignated purposes and with defined powers, created national\r\ngovernments, how is it that the most perfect of those several modes of\r\nunion should now be considered as a mere league that may be dissolved at\r\npleasure? It is from an abuse of terms. Compact is used as synonymous\r\nwith league, although the true term is not employed, because it would at\r\nonce show the fallacy of the reasoning. It would not do to say that our\r\nConstitution was only a league, but it is labored to prove it a compact\r\n(which in one sense it is) and then to argue that as a league is a\r\ncompact every compact between nations must of course be a league, and\r\nthat from such an engagement every sovereign power has a right to\r\nrecede. But it has been shown that in this sense the States are not\r\nsovereign, and that even if they were, and the national Constitution had\r\nbeen formed by compact, there would be no right in any one State to\r\nexonerate itself from its obligations.\r\n\r\nSo obvious are the reasons which forbid this secession that it is\r\nnecessary only to allude to them. The Union was formed for the benefit\r\nof all. It was produced by mutual sacrifices of interests and opinions.\r\nCan those sacrifices be recalled? Can the States who magnanimously\r\nsurrendered their title to the territories of the West recall the grant?\r\nWill the inhabitants of the inland States agree to pay the duties that\r\nmay be imposed without their assent by those on the Atlantic or the Gulf\r\nfor their own benefit? Shall there be a free port in one State and\r\nonerous duties in another? No one believes that any right exists in a\r\nsingle State to involve all the others in these and countless other\r\nevils contrary to engagements solemnly made. Everyone must see that the\r\nother States, in self-defense, must oppose it at all hazards.\r\n\r\nThese are the alternatives that are presented by the convention--a\r\nrepeal of all the acts for raising revenue, leaving the Government\r\nwithout the means of support, or an acquiescence in the dissolution of\r\nour Union by the secession of one of its members. When the first was\r\nproposed, it was known that it could not be listened to for a moment. It\r\nwas known, if force was applied to oppose the execution of the laws,\r\nthat it must be repelled by force; that Congress could not, without\r\ninvolving itself in disgrace and the country in ruin, accede to the\r\nproposition; and yet if this is not done in a given day, or if any\r\nattempt is made to execute the laws, the State is by the ordinance\r\ndeclared to be out of the Union. The majority of a convention assembled\r\nfor the purpose have dictated these terms, or rather this rejection of\r\nall terms, in the name of the people of South Carolina. It is true that\r\nthe governor of the State speaks of the submission of their grievances\r\nto a convention of all the States, which, he says, they \"sincerely and\r\nanxiously seek and desire.\" Yet this obvious and constitutional mode of\r\nobtaining the sense of the other States on the construction of the\r\nfederal compact, and amending it if necessary, has never been attempted\r\nby those who have urged the State on to this destructive measure. The\r\nState might have proposed the call for a general convention to the other\r\nStates, and Congress, if a sufficient number of them concurred, must\r\nhave called it. But the first magistrate of South Carolina, when he\r\nexpressed a hope that \"on a review by Congress and the functionaries of\r\nthe General Government of the merits of the controversy\" such a\r\nconvention will be accorded to them, must have known that neither\r\nCongress nor any functionary of the General Government has authority to\r\ncall such a convention unless it be demanded by two-thirds of the\r\nStates. This suggestion, then, is another instance of the reckless\r\ninattention to the provisions of the Constitution with which this crisis\r\nhas been madly hurried on, or of the attempt to persuade the people that\r\na constitutional remedy had been sought and refused. If the legislature\r\nof South Carolina \"anxiously desire\" a general convention to consider\r\ntheir complaints, why have they not made application for it in the way\r\nthe Constitution points out? The assertion that they \"earnestly seek\" it\r\nis completely negatived by the omission.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the position in which we stand: A small majority of the\r\ncitizens of one State in the Union have elected delegates to a State\r\nconvention; that convention has ordained that all the revenue laws of\r\nthe United States must be repealed, or that they are no longer a member\r\nof the Union. The governor of that State has recommended to the\r\nlegislature the raising of an army to carry the secession into effect,\r\nand that he may be empowered to give clearances to vessels in the name\r\nof the State. No act of violent opposition to the laws has yet been\r\ncommitted, but such a state of things is hourly apprehended. And it is\r\nthe intent of this instrument to _proclaim_, not only that the duty\r\nimposed on me by the Constitution \"to take care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed\" shall be performed to the extent of the powers\r\nalready vested in me by law, or of such others as the wisdom of Congress\r\nshall devise and intrust to me for that purpose, but to warn the\r\ncitizens of South Carolina who have been deluded into an opposition to\r\nthe laws of the danger they will incur by obedience to the illegal and\r\ndisorganizing ordinance of the convention; to exhort those who have\r\nrefused to support it to persevere in their determination to uphold the\r\nConstitution and laws of their country; and to point out to all the\r\nperilous situation into which the good people of that State have been\r\nled, and that the course they are urged to pursue is one of ruin and\r\ndisgrace to the very State whose rights they affect to support.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of _my_ native State, let me not only admonish you, as\r\nthe First Magistrate of our common country, not to incur the penalty of\r\nits laws, but use the influence that a father would over his children\r\nwhom he saw rushing to certain ruin. In that paternal language, with\r\nthat paternal feeling, let me tell you, my countrymen, that you are\r\ndeluded by men who are either deceived themselves or wish to deceive\r\nyou. Mark under what pretenses you have been led on to the brink of\r\ninsurrection and treason on which you stand. First, a diminution of the\r\nvalue of your staple commodity, lowered by overproduction in other\r\nquarters, and the consequent diminution in the value of your lands were\r\nthe sole effect of the tariff laws. The effect of those laws was\r\nconfessedly injurious, but the evil was greatly exaggerated by the\r\nunfounded theory you were taught to believe--that its burthens were in\r\nproportion to your exports, not to your consumption of imported\r\narticles. Your pride was roused by the assertion that a submission to\r\nthose laws was a state of vassalage and that resistance to them was\r\nequal in patriotic merit to the opposition our fathers offered to the\r\noppressive laws of Great Britain. You were told that this opposition\r\nmight be peaceably, might be constitutionally, made; that you might\r\nenjoy all the advantages of the Union and bear none of its burthens.\r\nEloquent appeals to your passions, to your State pride, to your native\r\ncourage, to your sense of real injury, were used to prepare you for the\r\nperiod when the mask which concealed the hideous features of _disunion_\r\nshould be taken off. It fell, and you were made to look with complacency\r\non objects which not long since you would have regarded with horror.\r\nLook back to the arts which have brought you to this state; look forward\r\nto the consequences to which it must inevitably lead! Look back to what\r\nwas first told you as an inducement to enter into this dangerous course.\r\nThe great political truth was repeated to you that you had the\r\nrevolutionary right of resisting all laws that were palpably\r\nunconstitutional and intolerably oppressive. It was added that the right\r\nto nullify a law rested on the same principle, but that it was a\r\npeaceable remedy. This character which was given to it made you receive\r\nwith too much confidence the assertions that were made of the\r\nunconstitutionally of the law and its oppressive effects. Mark, my\r\nfellow-citizens, that by the admission of your leaders the\r\nunconstitutionality must be _palpable_, or it will not justify either\r\nresistance or nullification. What is the meaning of the word _palpable_\r\nin the sense in which it is here used? That which is apparent to\r\neveryone; that which no man of ordinary intellect will fail to perceive.\r\nIs the unconstitutionality of these laws of that description? Let those\r\namong your leaders who once approved and advocated the principle of\r\nprotective duties answer the question; and let them choose whether they\r\nwill be considered as incapable then of perceiving that which must have\r\nbeen apparent to every man of common understanding, or as imposing upon\r\nyour confidence and endeavoring to mislead you now. In either case they\r\nare unsafe guides in the perilous path they urge you to tread. Ponder\r\nwell on this circumstance, and you will know how to appreciate the\r\nexaggerated language they address to you. They are not champions of\r\nliberty, emulating the fame of our Revolutionary fathers, nor are you an\r\noppressed people, contending, as they repeat to you, against worse than\r\ncolonial vassalage. You are free members of a flourishing and happy\r\nUnion. There is no settled design to oppress you. You have indeed felt\r\nthe unequal operation of laws which may have been unwisely, not\r\nunconstitutionally, passed; but that inequality must necessarily be\r\nremoved. At the very moment when you were madly urged on to the\r\nunfortunate course you have begun a change in public opinion had\r\ncommenced. The nearly approaching payment of the public debt and the\r\nconsequent necessity of a diminution of duties had already produced a\r\nconsiderable reduction, and that, too, on some articles of general\r\nconsumption in your State. The importance of this change was underrated,\r\nand you were authoritatively told that no further alleviation of your\r\nburthens was to be expected at the very time when the condition of the\r\ncountry imperiously demanded such a modification of the duties as should\r\nreduce them to a just and equitable scale. But, as if apprehensive of\r\nthe effect of this change in allaying your discontents, you were\r\nprecipitated into the fearful state in which you now find yourselves.\r\n\r\nI have urged you to look back to the means that were used to hurry you\r\non to the position you have now assumed and forward to the consequences\r\nit will produce. Something more is necessary. Contemplate the condition\r\nof that country of which you still form an important part. Consider its\r\nGovernment, uniting in one bond of common interest and general\r\nprotection so many different States, giving to all their inhabitants the\r\nproud title of _American citizen_, protecting their commerce, securing\r\ntheir literature and their arts, facilitating their intercommunication,\r\ndefending their frontiers, and making their name respected in the\r\nremotest parts of the earth. Consider the extent of its territory, its\r\nincreasing and happy population, its advance in arts which render life\r\nagreeable, and the sciences which elevate the mind. See education\r\nspreading the lights of religion, morality, and general information into\r\nevery cottage in this wide extent of our Territories and States. Behold\r\nit as the asylum where the wretched and the oppressed find a refuge and\r\nsupport. Look on this picture of happiness and honor and say, _We too\r\nare citizens of America_. Carolina is one of these proud States; her\r\narms have defended, her best blood has cemented, this happy Union. And\r\nthen add, if you can, without horror and remorse, This happy Union we\r\nwill dissolve; this picture of peace and prosperity we will deface; this\r\nfree intercourse we will interrupt; these fertile fields we will deluge\r\nwith blood; the protection of that glorious flag we renounce; the very\r\nname of Americans we discard. And for what, mistaken men? For what do\r\nyou throw away these inestimable blessings? For what would you exchange\r\nyour share in the advantages and honor of the Union? For the dream of a\r\nseparate independence--a dream interrupted by bloody conflicts with your\r\nneighbors and a vile dependence on a foreign power. If your leaders\r\ncould succeed in establishing a separation, what would be your\r\nsituation? Are you united at home? Are you free from the apprehension of\r\ncivil discord, with all its fearful consequences? Do our neighboring\r\nrepublics, every day suffering some new revolution or contending with\r\nsome new insurrection, do they excite your envy? But the dictates of a\r\nhigh duty oblige me solemnly to announce that you can not succeed. The\r\nlaws of the United States must be executed. I have no discretionary\r\npower on the subject; my duty is emphatically pronounced in the\r\nConstitution. Those who told you that you might peaceably prevent their\r\nexecution deceived you; they could not have been deceived themselves.\r\nThey know that a forcible opposition could alone prevent the execution\r\nof the laws, and they know that such opposition must be repelled. Their\r\nobject is disunion. But be not deceived by names. Disunion by armed\r\nforce is _treason_. Are you really ready to incur its guilt? If you are,\r\non the heads of the instigators of the act be the dreadful consequences;\r\non their heads be the dishonor, but on yours may fall the punishment. On\r\nyour unhappy State will inevitably fall all the evils of the conflict\r\nyou force upon the Government of your country. It can not accede to the\r\nmad project of disunion, of which you would be the first victims. Its\r\nFirst Magistrate can not, if he would, avoid the performance of his\r\nduty. The consequence must be fearful for you, distressing to your\r\nfellow-citizens here and to the friends of good government throughout\r\nthe world. Its enemies have beheld our prosperity with a vexation they\r\ncould not conceal; it was a standing refutation of their slavish\r\ndoctrines, and they will point to our discord with the triumph of\r\nmalignant joy. It is yet in your power to disappoint them. There is yet\r\ntime to show that the descendants of the Pinckneys, the Sumpters, the\r\nRutledges, and of the thousand other names which adorn the pages of your\r\nRevolutionary history will not abandon that Union to support which so\r\nmany of them fought and bled and died. I adjure you, as you honor their\r\nmemory, as you love the cause of freedom, to which they dedicated their\r\nlives, as you prize the peace of your country, the lives of its best\r\ncitizens, and your own fair fame, to retrace your steps. Snatch from the\r\narchives of your State the disorganizing edict of its convention; bid\r\nits members to reassemble and promulgate the decided expressions of your\r\nwill to remain in the path which alone can conduct you to safety,\r\nprosperity, and honor. Tell them that compared to disunion all other\r\nevils are light, because that brings with it an accumulation of all.\r\nDeclare that you will never take the field unless the star-spangled\r\nbanner of your country shall float over you; that you will not be\r\nstigmatized when dead, and dishonored and scorned while you live, as the\r\nauthors of the first attack on the Constitution of your country. Its\r\ndestroyers you can not be. You may disturb its peace, you may interrupt\r\nthe course of its prosperity, you may cloud its reputation for\r\nstability; but its tranquillity will be restored, its prosperity will\r\nreturn, and the stain upon its national character will be transferred\r\nand remain an eternal blot on the memory of those who caused the\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of the United States, the threat of unhallowed disunion,\r\nthe names of those once respected by whom it is uttered, the array of\r\nmilitary force to support it, denote the approach of a crisis in our\r\naffairs on which the continuance of our unexampled prosperity, our\r\npolitical existence, and perhaps that of all free governments may\r\ndepend. The conjuncture demanded a free, a full, and explicit\r\nenunciation, not only of my intentions, but of my principles of action;\r\nand as the claim was asserted of a right by a State to annul the laws of\r\nthe Union, and even to secede from it at pleasure, a frank exposition of\r\nmy opinions in relation to the origin and form of our Government and the\r\nconstruction I give to the instrument by which it was created seemed to\r\nbe proper. Having the fullest confidence in the justness of the legal\r\nand constitutional opinion of my duties which has been expressed, I rely\r\nwith equal confidence on your undivided support in my determination to\r\nexecute the laws, to preserve the Union by all constitutional means, to\r\narrest, if possible, by moderate and firm measures the necessity of a\r\nrecourse to force; and if it be the will of Heaven that the recurrence\r\nof its primeval curse on man for the shedding of a brother's blood\r\nshould fall upon our land, that it be not called down by any offensive\r\nact on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, the momentous case is before you. On your undivided\r\nsupport of your Government depends the decision of the great question it\r\ninvolves--whether your sacred Union will be preserved and the blessing\r\nit secures to us as one people shall be perpetuated. No one can doubt\r\nthat the unanimity with which that decision will be expressed will be\r\nsuch as to inspire new confidence in republican institutions, and that\r\nthe prudence, the wisdom, and the courage which it will bring to their\r\ndefense will transmit them unimpaired and invigorated to our children.\r\n\r\nMay the Great Ruler of Nations grant that the signal blessings with\r\nwhich He has favored ours may not, by the madness of party or personal\r\nambition, be disregarded and lost; and may His wise providence bring\r\nthose who have produced this crisis to see the folly before they feel\r\nthe misery of civil strife, and inspire a returning veneration for that\r\nUnion which, if we may dare to penetrate His designs, He has chosen as\r\nthe only means of attaining the high destinies to which we may\r\nreasonably aspire.\r\n\r\n(SEAL.)\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\nhereunto affixed, having signed the same with my hand.
