No such\r\ncomprehensive work by a competent writer is now in existence.\r\nIndividual writers have treated only limited chronological fields.\r\nMeantime there, is a rapid increase of published sources and of\r\nserviceable monographs based on material hitherto unused. On the one\r\nside there is a necessity for an intelligent summarizing of the present\r\nknowledge of American history by trained specialists; on the other hand\r\nthere is need of a complete work, written in untechnical style, which\r\nshall serve for the instruction and the entertainment of the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this double task within a time short enough to serve its\r\npurpose, there is but one possible method, the co-operative. Such a\r\ndivision of labor has been employed in several German, French, and\r\nEnglish enterprises; but this is the first attempt, to carry out that\r\nsystem on a large scale for the whole of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe title of the work succinctly suggests the character of the series,\r\nThe American Nation. A History. From Original Materials by Associated\r\nScholars. The subject is the \"American Nation,\" the people combined\r\ninto a mighty political organization, with a national tradition, a\r\nnational purpose, and a national character. But the nation, as it is,\r\nis built upon its own past and can be understood only in the light of\r\nits origin and development. Hence this series is a \"history,\" and a\r\nconsecutive history, in which events shall be shown not only in their\r\nsuccession, but in their relation to one another; in which cause shall\r\nbe connected with effect and the effect become a second cause. It is a\r\nhistory \"from original materials,\" because such materials, combined\r\nwith the recollections of living men, are the only source of our\r\nknowledge of the past. No accurate history can be written which does\r\nnot spring from the sources, and it is safer to use them at first hand\r\nthan to accept them as quoted or expounded by other people. It is a\r\nhistory written by \"scholars\"; the editor expects that each writer\r\nshall have had previous experience in investigation and in statement.\r\nIt is a history by \"associated scholars,\" because each can thus bring\r\nto bear his special knowledge and his special aptitude.\r\n\r\nPrevious efforts to fuse together into one work short chapters by many\r\nhands have not been altogether happy; the results have usually been\r\nencyclopaedic, uneven, and abounding in gaps. Hence in this series the\r\nwhole work is divided into twenty-six volumes, in each of which the\r\nwriter is free to develop a period for himself. It is the editor's\r\nfunction to see that the links of the chain are adjusted to each other,\r\nend to end, and that no considerable subjects are omitted.\r\n\r\nThe point of view of The American Nation is that the purpose of the\r\nhistorian is to tell what has been done, and, quite as much, what has\r\nbeen purposed, by the thinking, working, and producing people who make\r\npublic opinion. Hence the work is intended to select and characterize\r\nthe personalities who have stood forth as leaders and as seers; not\r\nsimply the founders of commonwealths or the statesmen of the republic,\r\nbut also the great divines, the inspiring writers, and the captains of\r\nindustry. For this is not intended to be simply a political or\r\nconstitutional history: it must include the social life of the people,\r\ntheir religion, their literature, and their schools. It must include\r\ntheir economic life, occupations, labor systems, and organizations of\r\ncapital. It must include their wars and their diplomacy, the relations\r\nof community with community, and of the nation with other nations.\r\n\r\nThe true history, nevertheless, must include the happenings which mark\r\nthe progress of discovery and colonization and national life. Striking\r\nevents, dramatic episodes, like the discovery of America, Drake's\r\nvoyage around the world, the capture of New Amsterdam by the English,\r\nGeorge Rogers Clark's taking of Vincennes, and the bombardment of Fort\r\nSumter, inspired the imagination of contemporaries, and stir the blood\r\nof their descendants. A few words should be said as to the make-up of\r\nthe volumes. Each contains a portrait of some man especially eminent\r\nwithin the field of that volume. Each volume also contains a series of\r\ncolored and black-and-white maps, which add details better presented in\r\ngraphic form than in print. There being no general atlas of American\r\nhistory in existence, the series of maps taken together will show the\r\nterritorial progress of the country and will illustrate explorations\r\nand many military movements. Some of the maps will be reproductions of\r\ncontemporary maps or sketches, but most of them have been made for the\r\nseries by the collaboration of authors and editor. Each volume has\r\nfoot-notes, with the triple purpose of backing up the author's\r\nstatements by the weight of his authorities, of leading the reader to\r\nfurther excursions into wider fields, and of furnishing the\r\ninvestigator with the means of further study. The citations are\r\ncondensed as far as is possible while leaving them unmistakable, and\r\nthe full titles of most of the works cited will be found in the\r\ncritical essay on bibliography at the end of each volume. This constant\r\nreference to authorities, a salutary check on the writer and a\r\nsafeguard to the reader, is one of the features of the work; and the\r\nbibliographical chapters carefully select from the immense mass of\r\nliterature on American history the titles of the most authentic and the\r\nmost useful secondary works and sources. The principle of the whole\r\nseries is that every book shall be written by an expert for laymen; and\r\nevery volume must\r\n\r\ntherefore stand the double test of accuracy and of readableness.\r\nAmerican history loses nothing in dramatic climax because it is true or\r\nbecause it is truly told. As editor of the series I must at least\r\nexpress my debt to the publishers, who have warmly adopted the idea\r\nthat truth and popular interest are inseparable; to the authors, with\r\nwhom I have discussed so often the problems of their own volumes and of\r\nthe series in general; especially to the members of the committees of\r\nthe Massachusetts Historical Society, Virginia Historical Society,\r\nTexas Historical Society, and Wisconsin State Historical Society, whose\r\ngenerous interest and suggestions in the meetings that I have held with\r\nthem were of such assistance in the laying out of the work; to the\r\npublic, who how have the opportunity of acting as judges of this\r\nperformance and whose good-will alone can prove that the series\r\njustifies itself.\r\n\r\nALBERT BUSHNELL HART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S INTRODUCTION This first volume of the series supplies a needed\r\nlink between the history of Europe and the history of early America;\r\nfor whether it came through a Spanish, French, English, Dutch, or\r\nSwedish medium, or through the later immigrants from Germany, from\r\nItaly, and from the Slavic countries, the American conception of\r\nsociety and of government was originally derived from the European.\r\nHence the importance at the outset of knowing what that civilization\r\nwas at the time of colonization. Professor Cheyney (chapters i. and\r\nii.) fitly begins with an account of mediaeval commerce, especially\r\nbetween Europe and Asia, and the effect of the interposition of the\r\nTurks into the Mediterranean, and how, by their disturbance of the\r\nestablished course of Asiatic trade, they turned men's minds towards\r\nother routes to Asia by sea. Thence he proceeds to show (chapter iii.)\r\nhow the Italians in navigation and in map-making exhibited the same\r\npre-eminence as in commerce and the arts, and why Italy furnished so\r\nmany of the explorers of the western seas in the period of discovery.\r\nIt is an easy transition in chapter iv. to the dramatic story of the\r\nefforts of the Portuguese to reach India round Africa. The next step is\r\nto describe in some detail (chapters v. and vi.) the system of\r\ngovernment and of commerce which existed in Spain, France, and Holland\r\nin the sixteenth century; and the book will surprise the reader in its\r\naccount of the effective and far-reaching administration of the Spanish\r\nkingdom, the mother of so many later colonies. This discussion is very\r\nclosely connected with the account of Spanish institutions in the New\r\nWorld as described by Bourne in his Spain in America (volume III. of\r\nthe series), and we find the same terms, such as \"audiencia,\"\r\n\"corregidor,\" and \"Council of the Indies\" reappearing in colonial\r\nhistory. A much-neglected subject in American history is the\r\ndevelopment of great commercial companies, which, in the hands of the\r\nEnglish, planted their first permanent colonies. To this subject\r\nProfessor Cheyney devotes two illuminating chapters (vii. and viii.),\r\nin which he prints a list of more than sixty such companies chartered\r\nby various nations, and then selects as typical the English Virginia\r\nCompany, the Dutch West India Company, and the French Company of New\r\nFrance, which he analyzes and compares with one another. It is\r\nsignificant that not one of these companies was Spanish, for that\r\ncountry retained in its own hands complete control both of its colonies\r\nand of their commerce.\r\n\r\nSince English colonization was almost wholly Protestant and added a new\r\ncentre of Protestant influence, Professor Cheyney has, in two chapters\r\n(ix. and x.), given some account of the Reformation and of the\r\nreligious wars of the sixteenth century. He brings out not only the\r\ndifferences in doctrine but in spirit, and shows how, by the Thirty\r\nYears' War, Germany was excluded from the possibility of establishing\r\nAmerican colonies, a lack which that country has found it impossible to\r\nrepair in our day.\r\n\r\nThe mother-country for the American nation was in greater part England;\r\neven Scotland and Ireland contributed their numbers and their\r\ncharacteristics only in the third and fourth generations of the\r\ncolonies. A considerable part of this volume, therefore (chapters xi.\r\nto xvi.), is given up to a description of the conditions of England at\r\nthe time of the departure of the first colonists. Everybody knows, and\r\nnobody knows clearly, the religious questions in England from Elizabeth\r\nto James II. Here will be found a distinct and vivid account of the\r\nstruggle between churchmen, Catholics, Puritans, and Independents for\r\ninfluence on the Church of England or for supremacy in the state. Why\r\ndid the Catholics in general remain loyal? Why were the Puritans\r\npunished? Why were the Independents at odds with everybody else? Why\r\ndid not Presbyterianism take root in England? These are all questions\r\nof great moment, and their adjustment by Professor Cheyney prepares the\r\nway for the account of the Pilgrims who founded Plymouth colony in\r\nTyler's England in America (volume IV. of the series). An absolute\r\nessential for an understanding of colonial history before the\r\nRevolution is a clear idea of the political system of England, both in\r\nits larger national form and in its local government. Hence the\r\nimportance of Professor Cheyney's chapters on English government. The\r\nkings' courts, council, and Parliament all had their effect upon the\r\ngovernors' courts, councils, and assemblies of the various colonies.\r\nProm the English practice came the superb, fundamental notion of a\r\nright of representation and of the effectiveness of a delegated\r\nassembly. In local government the likeness was in some respects even\r\ncloser; and Professor Cheyney's account of the English county court,\r\nand especially of the township or parish, will solve many difficulties\r\nin the later colonial history. In some ways Professor Cheyney's\r\nconclusions make more striking and original the development of the\r\nastonishing New England town-meetings. As the volume begins with the\r\nrise of the exploring spirit, it is fitting that Prince Henry the\r\nNavigator should furnish the frontispiece. The bibliography deals more\r\nthan those of later volumes with a literature which has been a tangled\r\nthicket, and will shorten the road for many teachers and students of\r\nthese subjects. The significance of Professor Cheyney's volume is that,\r\nwithout describing America or narrating American events, it furnishes\r\nthe necessary point of departure for a knowledge of American history.\r\nThe first question to be asked by the reader is, why did people look\r\nwestward? And the answer is, because of their desire to reach the\r\nOrient. The second question is, what was the impulse to new habits of\r\nlife and what the desire for settlements in distant lands? The answer\r\nis, the effect of the Reformation in arousing men's minds and in\r\nbringing about wars which led to emigration. The third question is,\r\nwhat manner of people were they who furnished the explorers and the\r\ncolonists? The answer is found in these pages, which describe the\r\nSpaniard, the French, the Dutch, and especially the English, and show\r\nus the national and local institutions which were ready to be\r\ntransplanted, and which readily took root across the sea.\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE The history of America is a branch of that of Europe.\r\nThe discovery, exploration, and settlement of the New World were\r\nresults of European movements, and sprang from economic and political\r\nneeds, development of enterprise, and increase of knowledge, in the Old\r\nWorld. The fifteenth century was a period of extension of geographical\r\nknowledge, of which the discovery of America was a part; the sixteenth\r\ncentury was a time of preparation, during which European events were\r\ntaking place which were of the first importance to America, even though\r\nnone of the colonies which were to make up the United States were yet\r\nin existence. From the time of the settlement forward, the only\r\npopulation of America that has counted in history has been of European\r\norigin. The institutions that characterize the New World are\r\nfundamentally those of Europe. People and institutions have been\r\nmodified by the material conditions of America; and the process of\r\nemigration gave a new direction to the development of American history\r\nfrom the very beginning; but the origin of the people, of their\r\ninstitutions, and of their history was none the less a European one.\r\nThe beginnings of American history are therefore to be found In\r\nEuropean conditions at the time of the foundation of the colonies.\r\nSimilar forces continued to exercise an influence in later times. The\r\npower and policy of home governments, successive waves of emigration,\r\nand numberless events in Europe had effects which were deeply felt in\r\nAmerica. This influence of Europe upon America, however, became less\r\nand less as time passed on; and the development of the American nation\r\nhas made its history constantly more independent. It is, therefore,\r\nonly with some of the most important and earliest of these European\r\noccurrences and conditions that this book is occupied. The general\r\nrelation of America to Europe is a subject that would require a vastly\r\nfuller treatment, and it is a subject which doubtless will increasingly\r\nreceive the attention of scholars as our appreciation of the proper\r\nperspective of history becomes more clear. In so wide a field as that\r\nof this volume, it has been necessary to use secondary materials for\r\nmany statements; their aid is acknowledged in the footnotes and in the\r\nbibliography. Other parts, so far as space limits allowed, I have been\r\nable to work out from original sources. For much valuable information,\r\nsuggestion, and advice also, I am indebted to friends and fellow-\r\nworkers, and here gladly make acknowledgment for such assistance.\r\n\r\nEDWARD POTTS CHEYNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN BACKGROUND OF AMERICAN HISTORY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I THE EAST AND THE WEST\r\n\r\n(1200-1500)\r\n\r\nTo set forth the conditions in Europe which favored the work of\r\ndiscovering America and of exploring, colonizing, and establishing\r\nhuman institutions there, is the subject and task of this book. Its\r\nperiod extends from the beginning of those marked commercial,\r\npolitical, and intellectual changes of the fifteenth century which\r\ninitiated a great series of geographical discoveries, to the close, in\r\nthe later years of the seventeenth century, of the religious wars and\r\npersecutions which did so much to make that century an age of\r\nemigration from Europe. During those three hundred years few events in\r\nEuropean history failed to exercise some influence upon the fortunes of\r\nAmerica. The relations of the Old World to the New were then\r\nconstructive and fundamental to a degree not true of earlier or of\r\nlater times. Before the fifteenth century events were only distantly\r\npreparing the way; after the seventeenth the centre of gravity of\r\nAmerican history was transferred to America itself.\r\n\r\nThe crowding events, the prominent men, the creative thoughts, and the\r\nrapidly changing institutions which fill the history of western Europe\r\nduring these three centuries cannot all be described in this single\r\nvolume. It merely attempts to point out the leading motives for\r\nexploration and colonization, to show what was the equipment for\r\ndiscovery, and to describe the most significant of those political\r\ninstitutions of Europe which exercised an influence on forms of\r\ngovernment in the colonies, thus sketching the main outlines of the\r\nEuropean background of American history. Many political, economic,\r\nintellectual, and personal factors combined to make the opening of our\r\nmodern era an age of geographical discovery. Yet among these many\r\ncauses there was one which was so influential and persistent that it\r\ndeserves to be singled out as the predominant incentive to exploration\r\nfor almost two hundred years. This enduring motive was the desire to\r\nfind new routes, from Europe to the far East.\r\n\r\nColumbus sailed on his great voyage in 1492, \"his object being to reach\r\nthe Indies.\" [Footnote: Columbus's Journal, October 3, 21, 23, 24, etc\r\nCf. Bourne, Spain in America, chap, 11] When he discovered the first\r\nland beyond the Atlantic, he came to the immediate conclusion that he\r\nhad reached the coast of Asia, and identified first Cuba and then Hayti\r\nwith Japan. A week after his first sight of land he Reports, \"It is\r\ncertain that this is the main-land and that I am in front of Zayton and\r\nGuinsay\" [Footnote: Columbus's Journal, November 1] Even on his third\r\nvoyage, in 1498, he is still of the opinion that South America is the\r\nmain-land of Asia. [Footnote: Columbus's will] It was reported all\r\nthrough Europe that the Genoese captain had \"discovered the coast of\r\nthe Indies,\" and \"found that way never before known to the East.\"\r\n[Footnote: Ramusio, Raccolta de Navigazioni, I, 414] The name West\r\nIndies still remains as a testimony to the belief of the early\r\nexplorers that they had found the Indies by sailing westward.\r\n\r\nWhen John Cabot, in 1496, obtained permission from Henry VII. to equip\r\nan expedition for westward exploration, he hoofed to reach \"the island\r\nof Cipango\" (Japan) and the lands from which Oriental caravans brought\r\ntheir goods to Alexandria. [Footnote: Letter of Soncino, 1497, in Hart,\r\nContemporaries, I., 70.] It is true that he landed on the barren shore\r\nof Labrador, and that what he descried from his vessel as he sailed\r\nsouthward was only the wooded coast of North America; but it was\r\nreported, and for a while believed, that the king of England had in\r\nthis manner \"acquired a part of Asia without drawing his sword.\"\r\n[Footnote: Ibid. Cf. Bourne. Spain in America, chap v.] In 1501 Caspar\r\nCortereal, in the service of the king of Portugal, pressed farther into\r\nthe ice-bound arctic waters on the same quest, and with his companions\r\nbecame the first in the dreary list of victims sacrificed to the long\r\nsearch for a northwest passage. [Footnote: Harrisse, Les Cortereal]\r\nWhen the second generation of explorers learned that the land that had\r\nbeen discovered beyond the sea was not Asia, their first feeling was\r\nnot exultation that a new world had been discovered, but chagrin that a\r\ngreat barrier, stretching far to the north and the south, should thus\r\ninterpose itself between Europe and the eastern goal on which their\r\neyes were fixed. Every navigator who sailed along the coast of North or\r\nSouth America looked eagerly for some strait by which he might make his\r\nway through, and thus complete the journey to the Spice Islands, to\r\nChina, Japan, India, and the other lands of the ancient East.\r\n[Footnote: Bourne, Spain in America, chap viii.] Verrazzano, in 1521,\r\nand Jacques Cartier, in 1534, 1535, and 1541, both in the service of\r\nthe king of France, and Gomez, in the Spanish service, in 1521, were\r\nengaged in seeking this elusive passage. [Footnote: Pigeonneau,\r\nHistoire du Commerce de la France, II, 142-148.] For more than a\r\nhundred years the French traders and explorers along the St. Lawrence\r\nand the Great Lakes were led farther and farther into the wilderness by\r\nhopes of finding some western outlet which would make it possible for\r\nthem to reach Cathay and India. Englishmen, with greater persistence\r\nthan Spaniards, Portuguese, or French, pursued the search for this\r\nnorthwestern route to India. To find such a passage became a dream and\r\na constantly renewed effort of the navigators and merchants of the days\r\nof Queen Elizabeth; the search for it continued into the next century,\r\neven after colonies had been established in America itself; and a\r\ncontinuance of the quest was constantly impressed by the government and\r\nby popular opinion upon the merchants of the Hudson Bay Company, till\r\nthe eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nA tradition grew up that there was a passage through the continent\r\nsomewhere near the fortieth parallel. It was in the search for this\r\npassage that Hudson was engaged, when, in the service of the Dutch\r\ngovernment, in 1609, he made the famous voyage in the Half Moon and hit\r\non the Hudson River; just as in his first voyage he had tried to reach\r\nthe Indies by crossing the North Pole, and in his second by following a\r\nnortheast route. [Footnote: Asher, Henry Hudson, the Navigator, cxcii.-\r\ncxcvi.] Much of the exploration of the coast of South America was made\r\nwith the same purpose. To reach India was the deliberate object of\r\nMagellan when, in 1519 and 1520, he skirted the coast of that continent\r\nand made his way through the southern straits. The same objective point\r\nwas intended in the \"Molucca Voyage\" of 1526-1530, under the command of\r\nSebastian Cabot, [Footnote: Beazley, John and Sebastian Cabot, 152.] as\r\nwell as in other South American voyages of Spanish explorers. Thus the\r\nsearch for a new route to the East lay at the back of many of those\r\nvoyages of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which gradually made\r\nAmerica familiar to Europe.\r\n\r\nThe same object was sought in explorations to the eastward. The\r\nearliest voyages of the Portuguese along the coast of Africa, it is\r\ntrue, had other motives; but the desire to reach India grew upon the\r\nnavigators and the sovereigns of that nation, and from the accession of\r\nJohn II., in 1481, every nerve was strained to find a route to the far\r\nEast. Within one twelvemonth, in the years 1486 and 1487, three\r\nexpeditions left the coast of Portugal seeking access to the East. The\r\nfirst of these, under Bartholomew Diaz, discovered the Cape of Good\r\nHope; the second was an embassy of Pedro de Cavailham and Affonso de\r\nPaiva through the eastern Mediterranean to seek Prester John, a search\r\nwhich carried one of them to the west coast of India, the other to the\r\neast coast of Africa; the third was an exploring expedition to the\r\nnortheast, which reached, for the first time, the islands of Nova\r\nZembla. [Footnote: Beazley, Henry the Navigator.] The Portuguese\r\nambition was finally crowned with success in the exploit of Vasco da\r\nGama in reaching the coast of India by way of the southern point of\r\nAfrica, in 1498; the Spanish expedition under Magellan reached the same\r\nlands by the westward route twenty years afterwards. Even after these\r\nsuccesses, efforts continued to be made to reach China and the Indies\r\nby a northeast passage around the northern coast of Europe. Successive\r\nexpeditions of Portuguese, English, French, and Dutch were sent out\r\nonly to meet invariable failure in those icy seas, until the terrible\r\nhardships the explorers endured gradually brought conviction of the\r\nimpracticability of this, as of the northwestern, route. What was the\r\norigin of this eagerness to reach the Indies? Why did Portuguese,\r\nSpaniards, English, French, and Dutch vie with one another in centuries\r\nof effort not only to discover new lands, but to seek these sea-routes\r\nto the oldest of all lands? Why were the old lines of intercourse\r\nbetween the East and the West almost deserted, and a new group of\r\nmaritime nations superseding the old Mediterranean and mid-European\r\ntrading peoples? The answer to these questions will be found in certain\r\nchanges which were in progress in those lands east of the Mediterranean\r\nSea, which lie on the border-line between Europe and Asia. Through this\r\nregion trade between Europe and the far East had flowed from immemorial\r\nantiquity; but in the fifteenth century its channels were obstructed\r\nand its stream much diminished.\r\n\r\nMediaeval Europe was dependent for her luxuries on Asia Minor and\r\nSyria, Arabia and Persia, India and the Spice Islands, China and Japan.\r\nPrecious stones and fabrics, dyes and perfumes, drugs and medicaments,\r\nwoods, gums, and spices reached Europe by many devious and obscure\r\nroutes, but all from the eastward. One of the chief luxuries of the\r\nMiddle Ages was the edible spices. The monotonous diet, the coarse\r\nfood, the unskilful cookery of mediaeval Europe had all their\r\ndeficiencies covered by a charitable mantle of Oriental seasoning.\r\nWines and ale were constantly used spiced with various condiments. In\r\nSir Thopas's forest grew \"notemuge to putte in ale.\" [Footnote:\r\nChaucer, Sir Thopas, line 52.] The brewster in the Vision of Piers\r\nPlowman declares:\r\n\r\n\"I have good ale, gossip, Glutton wilt thou essay? 'What hast thou,'\r\nquoth he, 'any hot spices?' I have pepper and peony and a pound of\r\ngarlic, A farthing-worth of fennel seed for fasting days\" [Footnote:\r\nText C, passus VII, lines 355, etc.]\r\n\r\nFroissart has the king's guests led to \"the palace, where wine and\r\nspices were set before them.\" [Footnote: Froissart, Chronicles, book\r\nII, chap lxxx] The dowry of a Marseilles girl, in 1224, makes mention\r\nof \"mace, ginger, cardamoms, and galangale.\" [Footnote: Quoted in\r\nBeazley, Dawn of Modern Geography, II, 433, n.] In the garden in the\r\nRomaunt of the Rose, \"Ther was eek wexing many a spyce, As clow-\r\ngelofre, and licoryce, Gingere, and greyn de paradys, Canelle, and\r\nsetewale of prys, And many a spyce delitable, To eten when men ryse fro\r\ntable.\" [Footnote: Chaucer (Skeat's ed), lines 1367-1373.]\r\n\r\nWhen John Ball wished to draw a contrast between the lot of the lords\r\nand the peasants, he said, \"They have wines, spices, and fine bread,\r\nwhen we have only rye and the refuse of the straw.\" [Footnote:\r\nFroissart, Chronicles, book II, chap lxxiii.] When old Latimer was\r\nbeing bound to the stake he handed nutmegs to his friends as keepsakes.\r\n[Footnote: Froude, History of England.]\r\n\r\nPepper, the most common and at the same time the most valued of these\r\nspices, was frequently treated as a gift of honor from one sovereign to\r\nanother, or as a courteous form of payment instead of money. \"Matilda\r\nde Chaucer is in the gift of the king, and her land is worth 8 pounds,\r\n2d, and 1 pound of pepper and 1 pound of cinnamon and 1 ounce of silk,\"\r\nreads a chance record in an old English survey. [Footnote: Festa de\r\nNevil, p 16.] The amount of these spices demanded and consumed was\r\nastonishing. Venetian galleys, Genoese carracks, and other vessels on\r\nthe Mediterranean brought many a cargo of them westward, and they were\r\nsold in fairs and markets everywhere. \"Pepper-sack\" was a derisive and\r\nyet not unappreciative epithet applied by German robber-barons to the\r\nmerchants whom they plundered as they passed down the Rhine. For years\r\nthe Venetians had a contract to buy from the sultan of Egypt annually\r\n420,000 pounds of pepper. One of the first vessels to make its way to\r\nIndia brought home 210,000 pounds. A fine of 200,000 pounds of pepper\r\nwas imposed upon one petty prince of India by the Portuguese in 1520.\r\nIn romances and chronicles, in cook-books, trades-lists, and customs-\r\ntariffs, spices are mentioned with a frequency and consideration\r\nunknown in modern times.\r\n\r\nYet the location of \"the isles where the spices grow\" was very distant\r\nand obscure to the men of the Middle Ages. John Cabot, in 1497, said\r\nthat he \"was once at Mecca, whither the spices are brought by caravans\r\nfrom distant countries, and having inquired from whence they were\r\nbrought and where they grew, the merchants answered that they did not\r\nknow, but that such merchandise was brought from distant countries by\r\nother caravans to their home; and they further say that they are also\r\nconveyed from other remote regions.\" [Footnote: Letter of Soncino, in\r\nHart, Contemporaries, I., 70.] Such lack of knowledge was pardonable,\r\nconsidering that Marco Polo, one of the most observant of travellers,\r\nafter spending years in Asia, believed, mistakenly, that nutmegs and\r\ncloves were produced in Java. [Footnote: Marco Polo (Yule's ed.), book\r\nIII., chap vi., 217, n.] It was only after more direct intercourse was\r\nopened up with the East that their true place of production became\r\nfamiliarly known in Europe. Nutmegs and mace, cloves and allspice were\r\nthe native products of but one little spot on the earth's surface: a\r\ngroup of small islands, Banda, Amboyna, Ternate, Tidore, Pulaway, and\r\nPrelaroon, the southernmost of the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, just\r\nunder the equator, in the midst of the Malay Archipelago. Their light,\r\nvolcanic soil, kept moist by the constant damp winds and hot by the\r\nbeams of an overhead sun, furnished the natural conditions in which the\r\nspice-trees grew. Here the handsome shrubs that-yield the nutmeg and\r\nits covering of mace produced a continuous crop of flowers and fruit\r\nall the year around. Cloves grew in the same islands, as clusters of\r\nscarlet buds, hanging at the ends of the branches of trees which rise\r\nto a greater height and grow with even a greater luxuriance than the\r\nnutmeg-bushes. [Footnote: Wallace, The Malay Archipelago, chap. xix.]\r\n\r\nPepper had scarcely a wider field of production. The forests that\r\nclothed a stretch of the Malabar coast of India some two hundred miles\r\nin length, and extending some miles back into the interior, were filled\r\nwith an abundant growth of pepper-vines. One of the earliest of\r\nEuropean travellers in India, Odoric de Pordenone, says: \"The province\r\nwhere pepper grows is named Malabar, and in no other part of the world\r\ndoes pepper grow except in this country. The forest where it grows is\r\nabout eighteen days in length.\" [Footnote: Odoric de Pordenone\r\n(D'Avezac's ed), chap. x.] John Marignolli, in 1348, also speaks of\r\nthis district as \"where the world's pepper is produced.\" [Footnote:\r\nQuoted in Marco Polo (Yule's ed), II., 314, n., and Sir John\r\nMandeville, chap, xviii.] Its habitat was, however, somewhat more\r\nextensive, for in less abundance and of inferior quality the pepper-\r\nvines were raised all the way south to Cape Comorin, and even in the\r\nislands of Ceylon and Sumatra.\r\n\r\nCinnamon-bark was the special product of the mountain-slopes in the\r\ninterior of Ceylon, but this also grew on the Indian coast to the\r\nwestward, [Footnote: Marco Polo (Yule's ed), book III, chaps, xiv.,\r\nxxv.] and, in the form of cassia of several varieties, was obtained in\r\nThibet, in the interior provinces of China, and in some of the islands\r\nof the Malay Archipelago. Ginger was produced in many parts of the\r\nEast; in Arabia, India, and China. Odoric attributes to a certain part\r\nof India \"the best ginger that can be found in the world\" [Footnote:\r\nOdoric de Pordenone (D'Avezac's ed), chap. x.] and Marco Polo records\r\nits production of good quality in many provinces of India and China.\r\n[Footnote: Marco Polo (Yule's ed), book II, chap. lxxx., book III.,\r\nchaps, xxii., xxiv., xxv, xxvi.] A great number of other kinds of\r\nspices were produced in various parts of the Orient, and consumed there\r\nor exported to Europe. Precious stones were of almost as much interest\r\nto the men of the Middle Ages as were spices. For personal ornament and\r\nfor the enrichment of shrines and religious vestments, all kinds of\r\nbeautiful stones exercised an attraction proportioned to the small\r\nnumber and variety of articles of beauty and taste in existence.\r\n\r\n\"No saphir ind, no rube riche of price, There lakked than, nor emeraud\r\nso grene.\" [Footnote: Chaucer, Court of Love, lines 78, 79.]\r\n\r\nThese were as much characteristic products of the East as were spices.\r\nDiamonds, before the discovery of the American and African fields of\r\nproduction, were found only in certain districts in the central part of\r\nIndia, especially in the kingdom of Mutfili or Golconda. Marco Polo\r\ntells the same story of the method of getting them there that is\r\nreported by Sindbad the Sailor. [Footnote: Marco Polo (Yule's ed), book\r\nIII., chap, xix.; Arabian Nights.] Rubies, the next most admired stone\r\nof the Middle Ages, were also found, to some extent, in India, but more\r\nlargely in the island of Ceylon, in farther India, and, above all, in\r\nthe districts of Kerman, Khorassan, Badakshan, and other parts of the\r\nhighlands of Persia along the Oxus and Jaxartes rivers. [Footnote:\r\nHeyd, Geschichte des Levantehandels, II., App., I.] Sapphires, garnets,\r\ntopaz, amethyst, and sardonyx were found in several of the same\r\ndistricts and also in the mountains and streams of the west coast of\r\nIndia, from the Gulf of Cambay all the way to Ceylon. The greatest\r\nmarkets in the world for these stones were the two Indian cities of\r\nPulicat and Calicut; the former on the southeastern, the latter on the\r\nwestern shore of the great peninsula. Pearls were then, as now,\r\nproduced only in a very few places, principally in the strait between\r\nCeylon and the mainland of India, and in certain parts of the Persian\r\nGulf. In the native states in the south of India they were, however,\r\naccumulated in enormous quantities, and scarcely a list of Eastern\r\narticles of merchandise omits mention of them. One of the early\r\nEuropean expeditions brought home among its freight 400 pearls chosen\r\nfor their size and beauty, and forty pounds of an inferior sort. The\r\npassion of the native rajahs of India for gems had made the treasury of\r\nevery petty prince a storehouse where vast numbers of precious stones\r\nhad been garnered through thousands of years of wealth and\r\ncivilization. This mass served as the booty of successive conquerors,\r\nand from time to time portions of it came into the hands of traders,\r\nalong with stones newly obtained from natural sources. An early\r\nchronicler, in describing the return of the Polos to Venice from the\r\nEast, tells how, from the seams of their garments, they took out the\r\nprofits of their journeys in the East, in the form of \"rubies,\r\nsapphires, carbuncles, diamonds, and emeralds.\" [Footnote: Ramusio,\r\nRaccolta, quoted in Marco Polo (Yule's ed.), book I., chap, xxxvii.]\r\nDrugs, perfumes, gums, dyes, and fragrant woods had much the same\r\nattraction as spices and precious stones, and came from much the same\r\nlands. The lofty and beautiful trees from which camphor is obtained\r\ngrew only in Sumatra, Borneo, and certain provinces of China and Japan.\r\nMedicinal rhubarb was native to the mountainous districts of China,\r\nwhence it was brought to the cities and the coast of that country on\r\nthe backs of mules. Musk was a product of the borderlands of China and\r\nThibet. The sugar-cane, although it grew widely in the East, from India\r\nand China to Syria and Asia Minor, was successfully managed so as to\r\nproduce sugar in quantities that could be exported only in certain\r\nparts of Arabia and Persia. Bagdad was long famous for its sugar and\r\narticles preserved in sugar. Indigo was grown and prepared for dyeing\r\npurposes in India. [Footnote: Heyd, Geschichte des Levantehandels, II.,\r\nApp., I.] Brazil wood grew more or less abundantly in all parts of the\r\npeninsula of India and as far east as Siam and southern China. This\r\nwood, from which was extracted a highly valued dye, made a particularly\r\nstrong impression on the mediaeval imagination. European travellers in\r\nIndia gave accounts of its being burned there for firewood, as their\r\nstrangest tale of luxury and waste. It gave its name to a mythical\r\nisland of Bresil, in the western seas, which was the subject of much\r\nspeculation and romance. The same name was eventually applied to the\r\nSouth American country that now bears it, because it produced a similar\r\ndye-wood in large quantities. Sandal-wood and aloe-wood, which were\r\nvaluable for their beautiful surface and fragrance when used in\r\ncabinet-work, and for their pleasant odor when burned as incense, grew\r\nonly in certain parts of India.\r\n\r\nMany articles of manufacture, attractive for their material, their\r\nworkmanship, or their design, came from the same Eastern lands. Glass,\r\nof superior workmanship to anything known in Europe, came from\r\nDamascus, Samarcand, and Kadesia, near Bagdad. Objects of fine\r\nporcelain came from China, and finally became known by the name of that\r\ncountry. A great variety of fabrics of silk and cotton, as well as\r\nthose fibres in their raw state, came from Asia to Europe. Dozens of\r\nnames of Eastern origin still remain to describe the silk, cotton,\r\nhair, and mixed fabrics which came to Europe from China, India,\r\nCashmere, and the cities of Persia, Arabia, Syria, and Asia Minor.\r\nBrocade, damask, taffeta, sendal, satin, camelot, buckram, muslin, and\r\nmany varieties of carpets, rugs, and hangings, which were woven in\r\nvarious parts of those lands, have always since retained the names of\r\nthe places which early became famous for their manufacture. The metal-\r\nwork of the East was scarcely less characteristic or less highly valued\r\nin the West, though its varieties have not left such specific names.\r\n[Footnote: Heyd, Geschtchte des Levantehandels, II., App., 543-699.]\r\nEurope could feed herself with unspiced food, she could clothe herself\r\nwith plain clothing, but for luxuries, adornments, refinements, whether\r\nin food, in personal ornament, or in furnishing her palaces, her manor-\r\nhouses, her churches, or her wealthy merchants' dwellings, she must, in\r\nthe fifteenth century, still look to Asia, as she had always done. It\r\nis true that in the later Middle Ages many articles of beauty and\r\nornament were produced in the more advanced Western countries; but not\r\nspices nor drugs, nor precious stones, nor any great variety of dyes.\r\nOriental rugs are even yet superior to any like productions of the\r\nWest; and a vast number of other articles of Eastern origin then held,\r\nand indeed still hold, the markets.\r\n\r\nIn return for the goods which Europe brought from Asia a few\r\ncommodities could be shipped eastward. European woollen fabrics seem to\r\nhave been almost as much valued in certain countries of Asia as Eastern\r\ncotton and silk goods were in Italy, France, Germany, and England.\r\nCertain Western metals and minerals were highly valued in the East,\r\nespecially arsenic, antimony, quicksilver, tin, copper, and lead.\r\n[Footnote: Birdwood, Hand-book to the Indian Collection (Paris\r\nUniversal Exhibition, 1878), Appendix to catalogue of the British\r\nColonies, pp. 1-110.] The coral of the Mediterranean was much admired\r\nand sought after in Persia and India, and even in countries still\r\nfarther east. Nevertheless the balance of trade was permanently in\r\nfavor of the East, and quantities of gold and silver coin and bullion\r\nwere used by European merchants to buy the finer wares in Asiatic\r\nmarkets. There was much general trading in Eastern marts. Numbers of\r\nOriental merchants, like Sindbad the Sailor and his company, \"passed by\r\nisland after island and from sea to sea and from land to land; and in\r\nevery place by which we passed we sold and bought and exchanged\r\nmerchandise.\" The articles enumerated above were almost without\r\nexception in demand throughout the whole East, and were bought by\r\nmerchants in one place and sold in another. Marco Polo, in describing\r\nthe Chinese city of Zayton, says: \"And I assure you that for one\r\nshipload of pepper that goes to Alexandria or elsewhere destined for\r\nChristendom, there come a hundred such, aye and more too, to this haven\r\nof Zayton.\" [Footnote: Marco Polo (Yule's ed), book II., chap. lxxxii]\r\nEven as late as 1515, Giovanni D'Empoli, writing about China, says:\r\n\"Ships carry spices thither from these parts. Every year there go\r\nthither from Sumatra 60,000 cantars of pepper and 15,000 or 20,000 from\r\nCochin and Malabar--besides ginger, mace, nutmegs, incense, aloes,\r\nvelvet, European gold-wire, coral, woollens, etc.\" [Footnote: Quoted in\r\nibid, book II., 188.] Nevertheless the attraction of the West was\r\nclearly felt in the East. Extensive as were the local purchase and sale\r\nof articles of luxury and use by merchants throughout India, Persia,\r\nArabia, Central Asia, and China, yet the export of goods from those\r\ncountries to the westward was a form of trade of great importance, and\r\none which had its roots deep in antiquity. A story of the early days\r\ntells how the jealous brothers of Joseph, when they were considering\r\nwhat disposition to make of him, \"lifted up their eyes and looked, and,\r\nbehold, a travelling company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead, with\r\ntheir camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down\r\nto Egypt.\" [Footnote: Genesis, xxxvii. 25.] When the prophet cries,\r\n\"Who is this that cometh from Edom, with garments dyed red from\r\nBozrah?\" he is using two of the most familiar names on the lines of\r\nwest Asiatic trade. Solomon gave proof of his wisdom and made his\r\nkingdom great by seizing the lines of the trade-routes from Tadmor in\r\nthe desert and Damascus in the north to the upper waters of the Red Sea\r\non the south. The \"royal road\" of the Persian kings from Sousa to\r\nEphesus made a long detour through northern Asia Minor, which was\r\ninexplicable to modern archaeologists until it was perceived that it\r\nwas following the line of a trade-route much more ancient than the\r\nPersian monarchy. [Footnote: Ramsay, The Historical Geography of Asia\r\nMinor, chap. i.] The harbor of Berenice, named after the mother of\r\nPtolemy Philadelpnus, was built by him as a place of transit for goods\r\nfrom India which were to be carried from the Red Sea to the Nile.\r\n[Footnote: Hunter, Hist. of British India, I., 40.] Roman roads\r\nfollowed ancient lines through Asia Minor and Syria, and medieval\r\nroutes in turn, in many places, passed by the remains of Roman\r\nstations. Thus the East and the West had been drawn together by a\r\nmutual commercial attraction from the earliest times, an attraction\r\nbased on the respective natural productions of the two continents, and\r\nfavored by the vast superiority of the East in the creation of articles\r\nof beauty and usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nORIENTAL AND OCCIDENTAL TRADE-ROUTES (1200-1500)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century Eastern goods regularly reached the West by\r\none of three general routes through Asia. Each of these had, of course,\r\nits ramifications and divergences; they were like three river-systems,\r\nchanging their courses from time to time and occasionally running in\r\ndivided streams, but never ceasing to follow the general course marked\r\nout for them by great physical features. The southernmost of these\r\nthree routes was distinguished by being a sea-route in all except its\r\nvery latest stages. Chinese and Japanese junks and Malaysian proas\r\ngathered goods from the coasts of China and Japan and the islands of\r\nthe great Malay Archipelago, and bought and sold along the shores of\r\nthe China Sea till their westward voyages brought them into the straits\r\nof Malacca and they reached the ancient city of that name. This was one\r\nof the great trading points of the East. Few Chinese traders passed\r\nbeyond it, though the more enterprising Malays made that the centre\r\nrather than the western limit of their commerce. Many Arabian traders\r\nalso came there from India to sell their goods and to buy the products\r\nof the islands of the archipelago, and the goods which the Chinese\r\ntraders had brought from still farther East.\r\n\r\nThe Indian and Arabian merchants who came to Malacca as buyers were\r\nmostly from Calicut and other ports on the Malabar coast, and to these\r\nhome ports they brought back their purchases. To these markets of\r\nsouthwestern India were also brought the products of Ceylon, of the\r\neastern coast, and of the shore of farther India. From port to port\r\nalong the Malabar coast passed many coasting vessels, whose northern\r\nand western limit was usually the port of Ormuz at the entrance to the\r\nPersian Gulf. A great highway of commerce stretched from this trading\r\nand producing region, and from the Malabar ports directly across the\r\nArabian Sea to the entrance of the Red Sea. When these waters were\r\nreached, many ports of debarkation from Mecca northward might be used.\r\nBut the prevailing north winds made navigation in the Red Sea\r\ndifficult, and most of the goods which eventually reached Europe by\r\nthis route were landed on the western coast, to be carried by caravan--\r\nto Kus, in Egypt, and then either by caravans or in boats down the line\r\nof the Nile to Cairo.\r\n\r\nCairo was a very great city, its population being occupied largely in\r\nthe transmission of goods. A fifteenth-century traveller counted 15,000\r\nboats in the Nile at one time; [Footnote: Piloti, quoted in Heyd,\r\nGeschichte des Levantehandels, II., 43.] and another learned that there\r\nwere in all some 36,000 boats belonging in Cairo engaged in traffic up\r\nand down the river. [Footnote: Ibn Batuta, quoted, ibid.] From Cairo a\r\ngreat part of these goods were taken for sale to Alexandria, which was\r\nin many ways as much a European as an African city. Thus a regular\r\nroute stretched along the southern coasts of Asia, allowing goods\r\nproduced in all lands of the Orient to be gathered up in the course of\r\ntrade and transferred as regular articles of commerce to the\r\nsoutheastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nA second route lay in latitudes to the north of that just described.\r\nFrom the ports on the west coast of India a considerable proportion of\r\nthe goods destined ultimately for Europe made their way northward to\r\nthe Persian Gulf. A line of trading cities extending along its shores\r\nfrom Ormuz near the mouth of the gulf to Bassorah at its head served as\r\nports of call for the vessels which carried this merchandise. Several\r\nof these coast cities were also termini of caravan routes entering them\r\nfrom the eastward, forming a net-work which united the various\r\nprovinces of Persia and reached through the passes of Afghanistan into\r\nnorthern India. From the head of the Persian Gulf one branch of this\r\nroute went up the line of the Tigris to Bagdad. From this point goods\r\nwere taken by caravan through Kurdistan to Tabriz, the great northern\r\ncapital of Persia, and thence westward either to the Black Sea or to\r\nLayas on the Mediterranean. Another branch was followed by the trains\r\nof camels which made their way from Bassorah along the tracks through\r\nthe desert which spread like a fan to the westward, till they reached\r\nthe Syrian cities of Aleppo, Antioch, and Damascus. They finally\r\nreached the Mediterranean coast at Laodicea, Tripoli, Beirut, or Jaffa,\r\nwhile some goods were carried even as far south as Alexandria.\r\n\r\nFar to the north of this complex of lines of trade lay a third route\r\nbetween the far East and the West, extending from the inland provinces\r\nof China westward across the great desert of Obi, south of the\r\nCelestial mountains to Lake Lop; then passing through a series of\r\nancient cities, Khotan, Yarkand, Kashgar, Samarcand, and Bokhara, till\r\nit finally reached the region of the Caspian Sea. This main northern\r\nroute was joined by others which crossed the passes of the Himalayas\r\nand the Hindoo-Kush, and brought into a united stream the products of\r\nIndia and China.[Footnote: Hunter, Hist. of British India, I., 31.] A\r\njourney of eighty to a hundred days over desert, mountain, and steppes\r\nlay by this route between the Chinese wall and the Caspian. From still\r\nfarther north in China a parallel road to this passed to the north of\r\nthe desert and the mountains, and by way of Lake Balkash, to the same\r\nancient and populous land lying to the east of the Caspian Sea. Here\r\nthe caravan routes again divided. Some led to the southwestward, where\r\nthey united with the more central routes described above and eventually\r\nreached the Black Sea and the Mediterranean through Asia Minor and\r\nSyria. Others passed by land around the northern coast of the Caspian,\r\nor crossed it, reaching a further stage at Astrakhan. From Astrakhan\r\nthe way led on by the Volga and Don rivers, till its terminus was at\r\nlast reached on the Black Sea at Tana near the mouth of the Don, or at\r\nKaffa in the Crimea. [Footnote: Heyd, Geschichte des Levantehandels,\r\nII., 68-254.]\r\n\r\nAlong these devious and dangerous routes, by junks, by strange Oriental\r\ncraft, by river-boats, by caravans of camels, trains of mules, in\r\nwagons, on horses, or on human shoulders, the products of the East were\r\nbrought within reach of the merchants of the West. These routes were\r\ninsecure, the transportation over them difficult and expensive. They\r\nled over mountains and deserts, through alternate snow and heat. Mongol\r\nconquerors destroyed, from time to time, the cities which lay along the\r\nlines of trade, and ungoverned wild tribes plundered the merchants who\r\npassed through the regions through which they wandered. More regularly\r\nconstituted powers laid heavy contributions on merchandise, increasing\r\nmany-fold the price at which it must ultimately be sold. The routes by\r\nsea had many of the same dangers, along with others peculiar to\r\nthemselves. The storms of the Indian Ocean and its adjacent waters were\r\ndestructive to vast numbers of the frail vessels of the East; piracy\r\nvied with storms in its destructiveness; and port dues were still\r\nhigher than those of inland marts.\r\n\r\nWith all these impediments, Eastern products, nevertheless, arrived at\r\nthe Mediterranean in considerable quantities. The demands of the\r\nwealthy classes of Europe and the enterprise of European and Asiatic\r\nmerchants were vigorous enough to bring about a large and even an\r\nincreasing trade; and the three routes along which the products of the\r\nEast were brought to those who were able to pay for them were never,\r\nduring the Middle Ages, entirely closed. They found their western\r\ntermini in a long line of Levantine cities extending along the shores\r\nof the Black Sea and of the eastern Mediterranean from Tana in the\r\nnorth to Alexandria in the south. In these cities the spices, drugs,\r\ndyes, perfumes, precious stones, silks, rugs, metal goods, and other\r\nfabrics and materials produced in far Eastern lands were always\r\nobtainable by European merchants.\r\n\r\nThe merchants who bought these goods in the market-places of the Levant\r\nfor the purpose of distributing them throughout Europe were for the\r\nmost part Italians from Pisa, Venice, or Genoa; Spaniards from\r\nBarcelona and Valencia; or Provencals from Narbonne, Marseilles, and\r\nMontpellier. [Footnote: Beazley, Dawn of Modern Geography, II., chap.\r\nvi.] They were not merely travelling buyers and sellers, but in many\r\ncases were permanent residents of the eastern Mediterranean lands. In\r\nthe first half of the fifteenth century there were settlements of such\r\nmerchants in Alexandria in Egypt; in Acre, Beirut, Tripoli, and\r\nLaodicea on the Syrian coast; at Constantinople, and in a group of\r\ncities skirting the Black Sea. Even in the more inland cities of Syria,\r\nsuch as Damascus, Aleppo, and Antioch, Italians were established.\r\n[Footnote: Heyd, Geschichte des Levantehandels, II., 67.] The position\r\nof European merchants varied in the different cities on this trading\r\nborder between the East and the West, from that of mere foreign\r\ntraders, living on bare sufferance in the midst of a hostile community,\r\nto that of citizens occupying what was practically an outlying Venetian\r\nor Genoese or Pisan colony.\r\n\r\nIn the greater number of cases the Italian and other European merchants\r\nhad quarters, or fondachi, granted to them in the Eastern cities by the\r\nSaracen emirs of Egypt and Syria, or by the Greek emperor of Asia\r\nMinor, Constantinople, and Trebizond. These fondachi were buildings, or\r\ngroups of dwellings and warehouses, often including a market-place,\r\noffices, and church, where the merchants of some Italian or Provencal\r\ncity carried on their business affairs according to their own rules,\r\nunder permission granted to them by the local ruler. A Genoese or\r\nVenetian fondaco was usually governed by a consul or bailiff, appointed\r\nby the home government, or elected among themselves with the approval\r\nof the senate and doge at home. Two or more advisers were usually\r\nprovided by the home government to act with the consul in negotiations\r\nwith the local government. In more important matters embassies were\r\nsent directly from the doge to the ruler on whose toleration or self-\r\ninterest the whole settlement was dependent.\r\n\r\nFor whole centuries Italians had made up an appreciable part of the\r\npopulation of many cities of the Levant; the galleys of Venice, Genoa,\r\nand Pisa lay at their wharves discharging produce of the West and\r\nloading the products of the East; a large part of the income of the\r\nlocal potentates, or governors, was made up of export and import\r\nduties, harbor charges, and other impositions paid by the Western\r\nmerchants. The prosperity of these Greek and Saracen seaboard cities\r\nwas as largely dependent on this trade as was that of the merchants who\r\ncame there for its sake. [Footnote: Heyd, Geschichte des\r\nLevantehandels, I., 165, 168, 316, 363, 414, 443. etc., II., 430, 435,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the merchandise of the far East flowed to the Eastern\r\ncities of the Mediterranean, and how it was gathered there into the\r\nhands of European merchants. It remains to follow the routes by which\r\nit was redistributed throughout Europe. Both Genoa and Venice had\r\npossessions in the Greek Archipelago which formed stepping-stones\r\nbetween the home cities and their fondachi in the cities of the Levant.\r\nTrading from port to port along these lines of connection, or sometimes\r\ncarrying cargoes unbroken from their most distant points of trade, the\r\ngalleys of the Italian, French, or Spanish traders brought Eastern\r\ngoods along with the products of the Mediterranean islands and shores\r\nto the home cities. These cities then became new distributing-points of\r\nEastern and Mediterranean goods as well as of their own home products.\r\n\r\nVenice may fairly be taken as a type of the cities which subsisted on\r\nthis trade. Her merchants were the most numerous, widely spread, and\r\nenterprising; her trade the most firmly organized, her hold on the East\r\nthe strongest. To her market-places and warehouses a vast quantity of\r\ngoods was constantly brought for home consumption and re-export. From\r\nVenice, yearly fleets of galleys went out destined to various points\r\nand carrying various cargoes. One of these fleets, after calling at\r\nsuccessive ports in Illyria, Italy, Sicily, Spain, and Portugal, and\r\nafter detaching some galleys for Southampton, Sandwich, or London, in\r\nEngland, reached, as its ultimate destination, Bruges, in Flanders.\r\n[Footnote: Brown, Cal. of State Pap., Venetian.]\r\n\r\nOther goods were taken by Venetian merchants through Italy and across\r\nthe mountains by land. Most of the re-export from Venice by land was\r\ndone by foreigners. Over the Alps came German merchants from Nuremberg,\r\nAugsburg, Ulm, Regensburg, Constance, and other cities of the valleys\r\nof the Danube and the Rhine. They had a large building in Venice set\r\napart for their use by the senate, the \"Fondaco dei Tedeschi,\" much\r\nlike those settlements which the Venetians themselves possessed in the\r\ncities of the Levant. [Footnote: Simonsfeld, Der Fondaco dei Tedeschi\r\nin Venedig, II,] The goods which they purchased in Venice they carried\r\nin turn all through Germany, to the fairs of France, and to the cities\r\nof the Netherlands. Merchants of the Hanseatic League bought these\r\ngoods at Bruges or Antwerp or in the south German cities, and carried\r\nthem, along with their own northern products, to England, to the\r\ncountries on the Baltic, and even into Poland and Russia, meeting at\r\nKiev a more direct branch of the Eastern trade which proceeded from\r\nAstrakhan and Tana northward up the Volga and the Don.\r\n\r\nThus the luxuries of the East were distributed through Europe. With\r\noccasional interruptions, frequent changes in detail, and constant\r\ndifficulties, the same general routes and methods of transfer and\r\nexchange had been followed for centuries. It was the oldest, the most\r\nextensive, and the most lucrative trade known to Europe. It stretched\r\nover the whole known world, its lines converging from the eastward and\r\nsouthward to the cities of Syria, Asia Minor, and the Black Sea coast,\r\nand diverging thence to the westward and northward throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the Middle Ages this ancient and well-established\r\ntrade showed evident signs of disorganization and decline. The Levant\r\nwas suffering from changes which interrupted its commerce and which\r\nmade the old trade-routes that passed through it almost impracticable.\r\nThe principal cause for this process of decay and failure was the rise\r\nof the Ottoman Turks as a conquering power. About 1300 a petty group of\r\nTurks, in the heart of Asia Minor, under a chieftain named Osman, began\r\na career of extension of their dominions by conquering the other\r\nprovinces of Turkish or Greek origin and allegiance in their vicinity.\r\n[Footnote: Zinkeisen, Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches in Europa, I.,\r\n65-132.] Little by little the Osmanli pushed their borders out in every\r\ndirection till they reached the Mediterranean, the Sea of Marmora, and\r\nthe Black Sea. Within a century and a half, by the close of the reign\r\nof Murad II., in 1451, they had built vessels on the Aegean, plundered\r\nthe Greek islands and laid them under tribute, crossed the Dardanelles\r\nand made conquests far up in the Balkan Peninsula, pressed close upon\r\nthe Christian cities along the south coast of the Black Sea, and\r\nreduced the possessions of the Greek Empire to a narrow strip of land\r\naround Constantinople. [Footnote: Ibid., 184-708.] The Turkish Empire\r\nwas admirably organized for military and financial purposes and\r\ngoverned by a series of able sultans.\r\n\r\nThus a great power arose on the border-line between the Orient and the\r\nOccident, of which the merchant states of Italy and the West evidently\r\nhad to take account. But its existence did not at first appear to be\r\nnecessarily destructive to their interests. In many cases comparatively\r\nfavorable commercial treaties were made with the Turkish sultans, and\r\nthe facile Italians modified their trading to meet the new conditions.\r\n[Heyd, Geschichte des Levantehandels, II., 259, 260, 267, 275, 284,\r\netc.] Nevertheless, with the Turks there could be no such close\r\nconnection as that which had existed between the Western traders and\r\nthe old-established states in the East, under which they enjoyed\r\npractical independence so long as they paid the money. The Turks were\r\nnot only Mohammedans, they were barbarians; they added to the Moslem\r\ncontempt for the Christian the warrior's contempt for the mere\r\nmerchant. They were without appreciation for culture or even for\r\nrefined luxury.\r\n\r\nThe conquests of the Turks proceeded steadily to their completion. In\r\n1452 Sultan Mohammed II. built the fort of Rumili Hissari, on the\r\nEuropean side of the Bosporus, and gave the commander orders to lay\r\nevery trading-vessel that passed the straits under tribute. The next\r\nyear saw the final siege, the heroic resistance, and the fall of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nAmong its defenders were Venetians, Genoese, Florentines, and Italian\r\ncolonists from various settlements, summoned to the help of their\r\ncoreligionists against the Mohammedans. On its capture all their goods\r\nwere plundered, their leaders beheaded, those of rank held for ransom,\r\nand the common men slaughtered or sold as slaves. [Footnote: Pears, The\r\nDestruction of the Greek Empire.] The neighboring colony of Pera was\r\nleft to the Genoese, but humbled to the rank of a Turkish village with\r\na sadly restricted trade. Trade was allowed to and from Constantinople,\r\nbut all the old privileges were abrogated, and the city was now the\r\ncapital of a semi-barbarous ruler and race, who placed but small value\r\non things brought by trade and continually engaged in war.\r\n\r\nEspecially destructive to trade were the wars between the Turks and the\r\nItalian colonists of the eastern Mediterranean. Such wars were\r\ninevitable. In the progress of their career of conquest the Ottoman\r\nfleets early attacked the island possessions of Venice and Genoa in the\r\nAegean and their independent or semi-independent settlements on the\r\nshores of the Black Sea. Efforts for the defence of these involved war\r\nbetween the home governments and the rising Eastern power. From 1463 to\r\n1479 war between the Turkish Empire and Venice raged in Syria and Asia\r\nMinor, in the islands of the eastern Mediterranean, on the main-land of\r\nGreece, and northward to Albania. The Italian republic lost some of its\r\nbest territories, including the Greek islands, and only obtained\r\npermission to take its vessels through the Dardanelles and the Bosporus\r\non payment of a heavy annual sum. [Footnote: Heyd, Geschichte des\r\nLevantehandels, II., 325-332.] The few remaining island possessions of\r\nGenoa were also lost--Lesbos in 1462, Chios in 1466. A brave defence of\r\ntheir island homes was made by the Italians, but one after another\r\nthese succumbed to the terrible attacks of the Turks. [Footnote: Bury,\r\nin Cambridge Modern History, I., 75-81.]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the possessions still farther east had the same fate.\r\nImmediately after the downfall of Constantinople the Turks placed a\r\nfleet upon the Black Sea and attacked the colonies on the north coast\r\nat Kaffa, Soldaia, and Tana, and on the south at Trebizond and other\r\nports. One after another these cities were placed under tribute;\r\nrepeated battles destroyed their possessions; their population was\r\nenslaved and their property plundered. In 1461 Trebizond was captured;\r\nin 1500 Kaffa was finally conquered and the whole Christian population,\r\nafter many sufferings, carried off to live as a subject race in a\r\nsuburb of Constantinople. In 1499 and 1500 Venice lost almost all the\r\nrest of her possessions.\r\n\r\nSome of the cities of the West which had never had landed possessions\r\nin the East fared better under the Ottoman than did Venice and Genoa.\r\nFlorentines, Ragusans, and men of Ancona, for some decades, took their\r\ngalleys from port to port of the Turkish coasts and islands, or passed\r\nas individual traders back along the trade-routes seeking goods for\r\nexport. Nevertheless, the flow of Eastern goods along these routes was\r\nbecoming less and less; the internal wars of rival Tartar rulers and\r\nthose between Tartars and Turks threw the northern routes and parts of\r\nthe central route into even more than their usual confusion; and the\r\nlessened demands at the ports of the Black Sea and Asia Minor\r\ndiscouraged the bringing of goods from the Eastern sources of supply.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish thirst for conquest brought under the control of that race,\r\nin the half-century between 1450 and 1500, half the western termini of\r\nthe trade-routes with the East. It crushed out all semblance of\r\nindependence in the settlements of the European merchants in Asia Minor\r\nand on the Black Sea, and left to them a bare foothold for purposes of\r\ntrade under the most burdensome restrictions. These conquests were very\r\ndestructive to life and property. Mercantile firms failed, old families\r\ndied out, the mother-states were exhausted, and the flow of merchandise\r\nwas dried up. The system of trade which had been in existence in these\r\nregions for centuries was quite destroyed by this violence.\r\n\r\nThe central and southern routes for a time remained open; indeed, the\r\nblocking of the more northerly outlets sent a greater proportion of the\r\ntrade in Eastern products through Syria and through the Red Sea ports.\r\nThe markets at Damascus, Aleppo, Beirut, and Alexandria were better\r\nfilled than ever with the products of the East. Even the Genoese, who\r\nhad so completely lost their prosperity, still had a fondaco in\r\nAlexandria in 1483; while the Venetians, notwithstanding their losses\r\nin the northeastern Mediterranean and their bitter struggles with the\r\nTurks, continued to make closer and closer trade arrangements with the\r\nSaracen emirs of the Syrian cities and the Mameluke sultans of Egypt.\r\nUnder heavy financial burdens and amid constant disputes they still\r\nkept up an active trade. Ten or fifteen galleys came every year from\r\nItaly, France, and Spain to Alexandria, which in the later years of the\r\nfifteenth century was by far the greatest market for spices in the\r\nworld. Even Florence, in the later years of the fifteenth century,\r\nopened up a trade with Egypt and Syria. [Footnote: Heyd, Geschichte des\r\nLevantehandels, II., 427-494.]\r\n\r\nThe southeastern Mediterranean was now destined to be swept by the same\r\nstorm as the other parts of the Levant. In the early years of the\r\nsixteenth century the Ottoman army invaded Syria and Egypt. In 1516 the\r\nsultan captured Damascus; in 1517 he entered Cairo as a conqueror.\r\nSyria and Egypt became a part of the Turkish Empire, as Asia Minor, the\r\nBalkan Peninsula, and the coasts of the Black Sea had already done.\r\nTreaties, it is true, were even yet formed by which Venice, at the\r\nprice of humiliating conditions, obtained permission from the Ottoman\r\ngovernment to continue a heavily burdened trade in the blighted cities\r\nof Egypt and Syria, as she was already doing in Constantinople. But the\r\nprocess by which Turkish conquest was attained, and the whole spirit\r\nand policy of that power, were adverse to trade between the East and\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThe old trade-routes between Asia and Europe were effectually and\r\npermanently blocked by the Turkish conquests. Not only routes of trade,\r\nbut methods of exchange, forms of transportation, and, in fact, the\r\nwhole system by which Eastern goods had been brought to Europe for\r\ncenturies, were interrupted, undermined, and made almost impracticable.\r\nDuring this period the city republics of Italy, which had been the\r\nchief European intermediaries of this trade, were losing their\r\nprosperity, their wealth, their enterprise, and their vigor. This was\r\ndue, as a matter of fact, to a variety of causes, internal and\r\nexternal, political and economic; but the sufferings in the wars with\r\nthe Turks and the adverse conditions of the Levant trade on which their\r\nprosperity primarily rested were far the most important causes of their\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\nThus the demand of European markets for Eastern luxuries could no\r\nlonger be met satisfactorily by the old methods; yet that demand was no\r\nless than it had been, and the characteristic products of the East were\r\nstill sought for in all the market-places of Europe. Indeed, the demand\r\nwas increasing. As Europe in the fifteenth century became more wealthy\r\nand more familiar with the products of the whole world, as the nobles\r\nlearned to demand more luxuries, and a wealthy merchant class grew up\r\nwhich was able to gratify the same tastes as the nobles, the demand of\r\nthe West upon the East became more insistent than ever. Therefore, the\r\nmen, the nation, the government that could find a new way to the East\r\nmight claim a trade of indefinite extent and extreme profit.\r\n\r\nThis is the explanation of that eager search for new routes to the\r\nIndies which lay at the back of so many voyages of discovery of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Southward along the coast of Africa,\r\nin the hope that that continent could be rounded to the southeast;\r\nnorthward along the coast of Europe in search of a northeast passage;\r\nwestward relying on the sphericity of the earth and hoping that the\r\ndistance from the west coast of Europe to the east coast of Asia would\r\nprove not to be interminable; after America was reached, again\r\nnorthward and southward to round and pass beyond that barrier, and thus\r\nreach Asia--such was the progress of geographical exploration for a\r\ncentury and a half, during which men gradually became familiar with a\r\ngreat part of the earth's surface. A study of the history of trade-\r\nroutes corroborates the fact disclosed by many other lines of study--\r\nthat the discovery of America was no isolated phenomenon; it was simply\r\none step in the development of the world's history. Changes in the\r\neastern Mediterranean led men to turn their eyes in other directions\r\nlooking for other sea routes to the East. When they had done so, along\r\nwith much else that was new, America was disclosed to their vision.\r\n\r\nTo follow out all the remote effects of the upheaval in western Asia\r\nand eastern Europe would lead too far afield: but the diversion of\r\ncommercial interest was only a part: the restless energies of the Latin\r\nraces of southern Europe turned into a new channel; search for trade\r\nled to discovery, discovery to exploration, exploration to permanent\r\nsettlement; and settlement to the creation of a new centre of\r\ncommercial and political interest, and eventually to the rise of a new\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nITALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO EXPLORATION\r\n\r\n(1200-1500)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in the fifteenth century Italy lost the commercial leadership\r\nwhich she had so long held, she did not cease to be the teacher of the\r\nother countries of Europe. In those arts which lay at the base of\r\nexploration, as in so many other fields, Italy was far in advance of\r\nall other Western countries. Through the Middle Ages she preserved much\r\nof the heritage of ancient skill and learning; by her Renaissance\r\nstudies she recovered much that had been temporarily lost; and in\r\ngeographical science she early made progress of her own. \"The greatness\r\nof the Germans, the courtesy of the French, the valor of the English,\r\nand the wisdom of the Italians\" is the tribute paid by a fifteenth-\r\ncentury Portuguese chronicler to the nations of his time, and this\r\n\"wisdom of the Italians\" he especially connects with exploration and\r\nnavigation.[Footnote: Azurara, \"Chronicle of Guinea,\" chap. ii.]\r\n\r\nAs a nation Italy played but a slight part in the discoveries of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries; but through her scattered sons she\r\nused her fine intelligence to initiate and guide much of the work that\r\nwas completed by the ruder but more efficient and vigorous nations of\r\nthe Atlantic seaboard. Educated men from Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and\r\nFlorence emigrated to other lands, carrying with them science, skill,\r\nand ingenuity unknown except in the advanced and enterprising Italian\r\ncity republics and principalities. Italian mathematicians made the\r\ncalculations on which all navigation was based; Italian cartographers\r\ndrew maps and charts; Italian ship-builders designed and built the best\r\nvessels of the time; Italian captains commanded them, and very often\r\nItalian sailors made up their crews; while at least in the earlier\r\nperiod Italian bankers advanced the funds with which the expeditions\r\nwere equipped and sent out.\r\n\r\nColumbus, Cabot, Verrazzano, and Vespucci were simply the most famous\r\nof the Italians who during this period made discoveries while in the\r\nservice of other governments. The Venetian Cadamosto led repeated and\r\nsuccessful expeditions for Prince Henry of Portugal; Perestrello, the\r\ndiscoverer of Porto Santo, in the Madeiras, and Antonio de Noli, the\r\ndiscoverer of the Cape Verd Islands, were both Italians. [Footnote:\r\nRuge, \"Der Zeitalter der Entdeckungen,\" 217.] This was no new condition\r\nof affairs. In the time of Edward II. and Edward III., in the service\r\nof England, we find the names of Genoese such as Pesagno and Uso de\r\nMare. Another Genoese, Emanuel Pesagno, was appointed as the first\r\nhereditary admiral of the fleet of Portugal, and by the terms of his\r\nengagement was required to keep the Portuguese navy provided with\r\ntwenty Genoese captains of good experience in navigation. Of the sixty\r\nmen who made up the complement of Magellan's fleet of 1519, in the\r\nservice of Spain, twenty-three were Italians, mostly Genoese.\r\n[Footnote: Navarrete, quoted in Ruge, Zeitalter, 466, n.] At the same\r\ntime all Spanish taxes were administered by Genoese bankers, and they\r\nor other Italians had a monopoly of all loanable capital. [Footnote:\r\nHume, Spain, Its Greatness and Decay, 87]\r\n\r\nLong before the great period of discoveries Italians contributed to the\r\nincrease of geographical knowledge by travel and narratives of travel\r\nover the world as it was already known, but only known vaguely and by\r\ndim report. Down to the middle of the thirteenth century the total\r\nknowledge of the lands and waters of the globe possessed by the\r\neducated men of Europe was not appreciably greater than it had been a\r\nthousand years earlier. The disintegration of the old Roman world, the\r\nmore stationary habits of life, and the narrower interests of men\r\nduring the early Middle Ages were unfavorable to travel.\r\n\r\nThe later Middle Ages were not lacking in keen intellect, in large\r\nknowledge, in powers of systematization and elaboration of what has\r\nalready been acquired; but they had neither the material equipment nor\r\nthe mental temperament to carry the boundaries of knowledge further.\r\nWhat was known of the world to Ptolemy in the second century made up\r\nthe sum of knowledge possessed by the geographers of all the following\r\ncenturies to the thirteenth. Indeed, the mediaeval tendency to\r\nestablish symmetrical measurements, to adopt fanciful explanations, and\r\nto find analogies in all things, obscured earlier knowledge and made\r\ngeographers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries less correct in\r\ntheir knowledge of the world than were those of the second or the\r\nthird. [Footnote: Beazley, Dawn of Modern Geography.]\r\n\r\nThe discoveries, conquests, and settlements of the Northmen in the\r\nnorth of Europe and the northern Atlantic were so detached from the\r\nknowledge of the south and came to a pause so early in time that\r\nnotwithstanding their potential value they contributed practically\r\nnothing to the general geographical knowledge of Europe. Nor did\r\nChristian, Jewish, or Arabic accounts of Eastern lands written by\r\ntravellers of the eleventh, twelfth, and early thirteenth centuries\r\nbecome widely known or influential. [Footnote: Ibid., II., chaps, i.-\r\niv.] Even the knowledge brought home by the Crusaders was of a\r\nrestricted territory, most of it already comparatively familiar; and\r\ntherefore they added little to the common stock.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the thirteenth century, however, began a series of\r\njourneys which were more fully recorded in narratives more widely\r\ncirculated and in a more receptive period. Three incentives habitually\r\ncarry men into distant and unknown lands--missionary zeal, desire for\r\ntrade, and curiosity. Actuated by one or other of these influences, an\r\nincreasing number of Europeans visited lands far beyond the eastern\r\nterminations of the trade-routes, and some of them brought back reports\r\nof which the influence was wide and lasting.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest and most observant were a succession of Franciscan\r\nfriars, sent after 1245 on missionary journeys to the court of the\r\nruler of the great Tartar Empire, which was then so rapidly\r\noverspreading Asia and eastern Europe. The first of these was John de\r\nPiano Carpini, a native of Naples, who belonged to a Franciscan house\r\nnear Perugia. He went through Bohemia, Poland, southern Russia, and the\r\nvast steppes of Turkestan, and found the Khan at Karakorum, in\r\nMongolia. He was two years on the journey, and after his return wrote\r\nan exact and interesting account of his observations and experiences.\r\n[Footnote: Travels of John de Piano Carpini (D'Avezac's ed.).]\r\n\r\nA few years afterwards William de Rubruquis--a Fleming in this case,\r\nnot an Italian--was sent to visit the Mongol emperor by Louis IX. when\r\nhe was in the East. He followed a more southerly route than Carpini,\r\nskirting the northern shores of the Black Sea, the Caspian, and the Sea\r\nof Aral, and then passing northward to Karakorum. Returning he crossed\r\nthe Caucasus and passed through Persia and the lands of the Turks,\r\nfinally reaching the Mediterranean through Syria. The account which he\r\nwrote of his adventures was much fuller than that of Piano Carpini, and\r\ngives descriptions of China as well as of the central Asiatic lands.\r\n[Footnote: Travels of William de Rubruquis (D'Avezac's ed).]\r\n\r\nJust at the beginning of the next century two other travellers, John de\r\nMonte Corvino [Footnote: Beazley, Dawn of Modern Geography, II, chap\r\nv.] and Odoric de Pordenone, [Foornote: Travels of Odoric de Pordenone\r\n(D'Avezac's ed)] both Italians, made journeys through Persia, India,\r\nsouthern Asia, and China, and later wrote accounts of these more\r\nsouthern lands quite as full as were those already mentioned concerning\r\nthe northern parts of the great eastern continent. The most famous of\r\nall mediaeval travellers in the East were the Venetian merchants Nicolo\r\nand Matteo Polo and their nephew Marco. These enterprising traders,\r\nleaving their warehouses in Soldaia on the Crimea, in two successive\r\njourneys made their way along the northern and central trade-routes to\r\nPekin, in northern China, or Cathay, which had become the capital of\r\nthe Great Khan. For almost twenty years the Polos were attached to the\r\ncourt of Kublai Khan, the nephew, Marco, rising higher and higher in\r\nthe graces of that ruler.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo was one of the well-known type of Italian adventurers who\r\nappeared at foreign courts, and, with the versatility of their race,\r\nmade themselves useful, and indeed indispensable, to their masters. He\r\nlearned the languages of the East, and went upon missions for the Great\r\nKhan to all parts of his vast empire. When, in 1292, the Polos obtained\r\npermission to return home they followed the longest and most important\r\nof the three main trade-routes which have been described. They sailed\r\nfrom Zaiton, a seaport of China, and passing along the shores of\r\nTonquin, Java, and farther India, made their way from port to port,\r\nthrough the Bay of Bengal to Ceylon, then to the Malabar coast of\r\nIndia, along which they passed to Cambay, and thence through the Red\r\nSea to Cairo, and so to Venice. Their journey homeward from China, with\r\nits long detentions in the East Indies, took almost three years.\r\n\r\nAll the world knows of Marco Polo's subsequent experiences in Venice,\r\nhis capture and imprisonment in Genoa, the stories of his travels with\r\nwhich he whiled away the weary days of his captivity, and the gathering\r\nof these into a book which spread widely through Europe within the next\r\nfew years and has been eagerly read ever since. [Footnote: Marco Polo\r\n(Yule's ed,), Introduction.]\r\n\r\nNeither the travels of Marco Polo nor those of his predecessors or\r\nimmediate successors disclosed any lands the existence of which was not\r\nbefore known to Europeans; but they gave fuller knowledge of many\r\ncountries and nations of which the names only were known; and they gave\r\nthis knowledge with astonishing freshness, minuteness, and accuracy.\r\nThe writers of these books travelled over many thousands of miles, and\r\nthey described, in the main, what they saw, although, of course, they\r\nrepeated, with more or less of exaggeration, much which they only knew\r\nfrom conversation or from hearsay. Besides the written stories of such\r\nexperiences, other Europeans who accompanied these travellers, or who\r\nmade independent journeys to various parts of Asia, spread knowledge of\r\nthe same things. The author of a later popular volume of travels,\r\npassing under the name of Sir John Mandeville, managed, by making use\r\nof a slight acquaintance with Asia, of a fuller knowledge of the\r\nwritings of other travellers, and, most of all, of the resources of a\r\nfertile imagination, to weave a tissue of mendacious description which\r\nreally lessened knowledge. [Footnote: Travels of Sir John Mandeville\r\n(ed. of 1900).]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as a result of these travellers' reports, the traditions\r\nof earlier times and the knowledge of the nearer East possessed by\r\ntraders were supplemented and popularized. The journeys of the\r\ntravellers of the later thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries were a\r\nveritable revelation to Europe of the condition of Tartary, Persia,\r\nIndia, China, and many intervening lands. Especially strong was the\r\nimpression made by the reports about China and Japan. The land of the\r\nSeres, lying on the border of the eastern ocean, had indeed been known\r\nto the ancients, and mentioned by tradition as the source from which\r\ncame certain well-known products; but under the name of Cathay, which\r\nMarco Polo and his contemporaries gave to it, it attained a new and\r\nstrong hold on men's imaginations. Its myriad population, its hundreds\r\nof cities, its vast wealth, its advanced civilization, its rivers,\r\nbridges, and ships, its manufactures and active trade, the fact that it\r\nwas the easternmost country of Asia, washed by the waters of the\r\nexternal ocean--all made Cathay a land of intense interest to the\r\nrising curiosity of thirteenth-century Europe. [Footnote: Pigeonneau,\r\n\"Histoire du Commerce de la France,\" II, 12, etc.] Similarly the great\r\nisland of Cipangu, or Japan, lying a thousand miles farther to the\r\neastward, though never actually visited by Marco Polo, and described by\r\nhim with a vague and extravagant touch, was of equally keen interest to\r\nhis readers, as were the \"twelve thousand seven hundred islands\" at\r\nwhich he calculates the great archipelagoes which lie in the Indian\r\nOcean and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt was his accounts of \"the province of Mangi,\" the cities of Zaiton\r\nand Quinsay, \"the Great Khan,\" \"the island of Cipangu,\" and of their\r\nvast wealth and active trade that took special hold on the mind of\r\nColumbus. His copy of Marco Polo may still be seen, its margins filled\r\nwith annotations on such passages, made by the great navigator;\r\n[Footnote: Vignaud, \"Toscanelli and Columbus,\" 95.] and it was to these\r\nthat his mind reverted when he had discovered in the West Indies, as he\r\nbelieved, the outlying parts of the Khan's dominions. [Footnote:\r\n\"Columbus's Journal,\" October 21, 23, 24, 26, 30, November 1, etc.] To\r\nthe westward also ancient knowledge was reacquired and made clearer.\r\nThe \"Fortunate Isles\" were rediscovered and identified as the Canaries\r\nby the Italian Lancelot Malocello in 1270 [Footnote: Beazley, Hakluyt\r\nSoc, \"Publications,\" 1899, lxi, lxxviii.], then forgotten and\r\nrediscovered in 1341 [Footnote: Ibid, lxxx; Peschel, \"Zeitalter der\r\nEntdecktungen,\" 37.] by some Portuguese ships, manned by Genoese,\r\nFlorentines, Castilians, and Portuguese. In 1291 Tedisio Doria and\r\nUgolino Vivaldi, Genoese citizens, equipped two galleys and sailed out\r\nthrough the Straits of Gibraltar and then to the southward, with the\r\nobject of reaching the ports of India, but were never heard of again\r\n[Footnote: Peschel, \"Zeitalter der Entdeckungen,\" 36.]. Both the\r\nMadeira Islands and the Azores became known as early as 1330, though\r\nperhaps only in a shadowy way, and were visited from time to time later\r\nin the fourteenth century, before they were regularly occupied in the\r\nfifteenth [Footnote: Nordenskiold, \"Periplus,\" 111-115; Major, \"Prince\r\nHenry the Navigator,\" chaps, v., viii., xiv.].\r\n\r\nThrough the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, therefore, thanks for\r\nthe most part to Italian travellers, substantial gains were made in\r\nexactitude and clearness of knowledge of the Old World. Though the\r\nbounds of geographical knowledge were not carried much farther, and\r\nless than one-fourth of the surface of the globe was as yet known to\r\nEuropeans, within these bounds knowledge became far more clear.\r\n\r\nIgnorance and superstition were still abundant; a mythical kingdom of\r\nPrester John was believed by one geographer to exist in Africa, by\r\nanother to be situated in India, and by still another to be in China;\r\nthe Atlantic was still dreaded by some as the dark, unknown limit of\r\nthe world; ignorant men may still have believed that the sea boiled at\r\nthe equator, and that men with dogs' heads and other monsters had each\r\nits own part of the earth; but Italians of any education, especially\r\nthose acquainted with the writings of their countrymen, must have been\r\nquite free from such mediaeval notions. By the year 1400 scientific\r\ninformation, critical habits of thought, and an interest in all forms\r\nof knowledge had reached in Italy a high degree of development and were\r\nfast spreading through Europe.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the earth was round was familiar to the Greeks and\r\nRomans, and was supported in the Middle Ages by the great authority of\r\nAristotle. [Footnote: Aristotle, De Ccelo, II., 14.] The only\r\ndifficulties lying in the way of an acceptance of this view through the\r\nmediaeval period were, in the first place, the mental effort required\r\nto conceive the earth as round when its visual appearance is flat; and,\r\nsecondly, the opposition of churchmen, who interpreted certain texts in\r\nthe Bible in such a way as to forbid the conception of the earth as a\r\nsphere. Yet neither of these influences was strong enough to prevail\r\nover the opinions of the majority of learned men. To them the earth was\r\nround, as it was to Aristotle, Ptolemy, and other ancients. [Footnote:\r\nRuge, Zeitalter der Entdeckungen.] The ball which the Eastern emperors\r\ncarried as an emblem of the world-wide extent of their rule, and which\r\nwas borrowed from them by various mediaeval potentates, had probably\r\nnot lost its meaning. Dante, in the Divina Commedia, not only plans his\r\nInferno on the supposition of a spherical earth, but takes for granted\r\nthe same conception, on the part of his readers. [Footnote: Inferno,\r\ncanto 34, lines 100-108.]\r\n\r\nThe conception of the sphericity of the earth was really a matter of\r\nmental training. In the fifteenth century those who had gained this\r\nknowledge were fewer than in modern times, but the class who did so\r\nbelieve were no less sure of it. Astronomers, philosophers, men of\r\ngeneral learning, and even navigators and pilots were quite familiar\r\nwith the idea and quite in the habit of thinking of the earth as a\r\nsphere. In all probability Columbus represented the beliefs of his\r\nclass, as well as his own, when he said, \"I have always read that the\r\nworld, comprising the land and the water, is spherical, as is testified\r\nby the investigations of Ptolemy and others, who have proved it by the\r\neclipses of the moon and other observations made from east to west, as\r\nwell as by the elevation of the pole from north to south.\" [Footnote:\r\nHakluyt Soc., Publications, Hist. of Columbus--Third Voyage, II., 129.]\r\nOpposition to voyages westward was based rather on the probability of\r\nthe enormous size of the earth and on the supposed difficulty of\r\nsailing up the slope of the sphere than it was upon any serious doubt\r\nof its sphericity.\r\n\r\nThe habitable world was quite a different conception. It consisted of\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa, these three continents forming a continuous\r\nstretch of land lying on the surface of the spherical earth, the rest\r\nof its surface being presumably covered with water. There was more or\r\nless speculation about the existence of other habitable lands on the\r\nearth than those which were known, but the interest in this possibility\r\nwas languid at best, and it was denied by learned churchmen on biblical\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nThe map-makers of that period continued, like those of the earlier\r\nMiddle Ages, to base their work on mere half-mythical traditions,\r\nunrelieved and uncorrected by the results of actual discoveries. Their\r\nmaps are still much like picture-books, filled with biblical and\r\nliterary lore, indicating but a slight attempt to incorporate exact\r\nmeasurements and outlines. A development more revolutionary than the\r\nmere gradual increase of knowledge was necessary to break the bonds of\r\nacademic tradition. [Footnote: Santarem, Essai sur L'Histoire de la\r\nCosmographie, I., 75, 167, 178.]\r\n\r\nJust at the beginning of the fourteenth century, however, a new line\r\nwas struck out in map-making by the construction and steady development\r\nof sailing charts, or \"portolani.\" These humble attempts at\r\ngeographical representation were intended as practical aids to\r\nnavigation for Mediterranean mariners, and were based on practical\r\nobservation. During the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries they\r\nreached a wonderful degree of accuracy. The coasts, bays, islands, and\r\npromontories of the Mediterranean were plotted out in them and drawn\r\nwith striking correctness. Some four hundred such sketch-maps remain to\r\nus, drawn by Italians from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries,\r\nbesides nearly a hundred made in other countries. [Footnote: Beazley,\r\nin Hakluyt Soc., Publications, 1899, cxx.] They did not undertake to\r\ngive the internal features of the countries whose coast-lines they\r\ndepicted, and as their main purpose was to aid Mediterranean trade,\r\nthey did not extend so far beyond its shore as the erudition of the age\r\nwould have made possible.\r\n\r\nThe best of the world maps of the fifteenth century were based on these\r\nItalian portolani rather than on mediaeval maps, and at the same time\r\nadded such enlarged information as became common in the Italy of the\r\nfifteenth century. [Footnote: Ibid., cxxi., etc.]\r\n\r\nThus, at the very beginning of the fifteenth century European explorers\r\nhad the benefit of the traditional ancient geography, of the new\r\nexactness of knowledge drawn from the observations of recent\r\ntravellers, of the accurate but limited portolani of the Italian\r\nnavigators, and finally of the more pretentious, if vague and often\r\nmisleading, world maps of learned geographers. If a sailor wished to\r\nnavigate the Mediterranean and its adjacent waters, if he planned to\r\nsail up the coast of Europe to the British Isles and on into the\r\nBaltic, or to pass down the Atlantic coast of Africa to Cape Nun, he\r\nmight rely on the maps and charts which the Italian geographers could\r\nfurnish him. Or if he launched his galleys on the Red Sea he might use\r\ntheir guidance down the east coast of Africa to the equator. He would\r\nalso find tolerably accurate descriptions of all the southern coasts of\r\nAsia. In the interior a traveller by land could know beforehand the\r\nmain features of the countries he might traverse. Beyond these limits,\r\neither by sea or by land, geographical knowledge must be sought by\r\ndiscovery or followed along the lines of dim report. If European\r\nsailors should follow the coast of Africa below the twenty-seventh\r\nparallel of north latitude, or of Europe above the sixtieth, or if they\r\nshould direct their course into the western ocean beyond the Azores,\r\nthey would be sailing into the unknown, and whatever they should find\r\nwould be fresh acquisition.\r\n\r\nThe two instruments which were the most requisite for distant voyaging,\r\nthe compass and the astrolabe (the predecessor of the quadrant), were\r\nalready, in 1400, known and used by Mediterranean navigators. The\r\nproperty of turning towards the north, possessed by a magnetized\r\nneedle, was certainly known as early as the close of the twelfth\r\ncentury; and even its use by sailors to find their directions when the\r\nsun and stars were obscured. More than one mediaeval writer describes\r\nthe process by which a needle is rubbed on a piece of magnetic iron,\r\nthen laid on a straw or attached to a piece of cork, and floated on\r\nwater till its point turns towards the north star. [Footnote: Alexander\r\nNeckham, De Utensilibus; De Natura Rerum, book II., chap, xcviii.;\r\nGuyot de Provins, La Bible, Jacques de Vitry, Historia Orientalis;\r\nBrunette Latini, Epistolas, who mentions Roger Bacon as showing him a\r\nmagnet at Oxford in 1258. Quoted in Beazley, Hakluyt Soc, Publications,\r\n1899, cxliv., etc.] But its properties savored of magic; the earlier\r\nsailors, who hugged the shore, scarcely needed it, and it came into\r\ngeneral use as slowly and imperceptibly as most of the other great\r\ninventions of the world.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the compass into general use is, by tradition,\r\nascribed to the Italian city of Amain, and it is easy to believe that\r\nthe enterprising sailors of this commercial republic brought it into\r\nestablished recognition. By the early years of the fifteenth century\r\nthe compass was provided with the card, marked with the directions,\r\nplaced in the compass-box, and made a well-known part of the equipment\r\nof the navigator. [Footnote: Azurara, Discovery of Guinea, chap ix.]\r\nThe mariner could now tell his directions wherever he might be, and the\r\nspider-web net-work of \"compass-roses\" on many of the early maps shows\r\nhow anxious the map-maker was to provide lines along which the\r\nnavigator might lay his course according to his compass. The makers of\r\nthe better class of portolani evidently had the use of the compass in\r\ndrawing their charts. [Footnote: Santarem, Essai sur L'Histoire de la\r\nCosmographie, I., 280-305.] The changed position of the heavenly bodies\r\nas the early traveller passed northward or southward struck him with\r\nespecial force. Marco Polo, describing the island of Sumatra, says,\r\n\"But let me tell you one marvellous thing, and that is the fact that\r\nthis island lies so far to the south that the north star, little or\r\nmuch, is never to be seen.\" [Footnote: Marco Polo (Yule's ed.), book\r\nIII., chap. ix.] He also notes on his journey northward through India,\r\nwhen he sees it again, \"two cubits above the water.\" When Cadamosto,\r\nthe Venetian, saw the pole-star at \"the third of a lance's length above\r\nthe edge of the waves,\" he recorded it as one of the most striking\r\nphenomena of his journey towards the equator.\r\n\r\nTwo instruments were known by which the elevation above the horizon of\r\nthe pole-star, or any other heavenly body could be measured. The older\r\nof these was the \"cross-staff,\" or St. James's staff, a simple rod\r\nmarked into degrees, at the end of which the eye was placed and along\r\nwhich a measured cross-piece was pushed, till one of its ends hid a\r\npoint oh the horizon and the other the sun or star whose height was\r\nbeing measured. The astrolabe was a somewhat more elaborate instrument,\r\nconsisting of a brass circle marked with degrees, against which two\r\nmovable bars were fastened, each provided at the ends with a sight or\r\nprojecting piece pierced by a hole. This was hung by a ring from a peg\r\nin the mast or from the hand, so that gravity would make one of its\r\nbars horizontal. Then the other bar was sighted to point towards some\r\nheavenly body. Chaucer, in 1400, gave to his \"litel Lowis my sone\" an\r\nastrolabe calculated \"after the latitude of Oxenford,\" and wrote a\r\ncharming treatise to explain to him in English its use, \"for Latin ne\r\ncanstow yit but smal, my lyte sone.\" In this treatise he described to\r\nhim, among other things, \"diverse tables of longitudes and latitudes of\r\nsterres.\" [Footnote: Chaucer, A Treatise on the Astrolabe, Prologue;\r\nSkeat, The Student's Chaucer, 396.] By means of either of these\r\ninstruments latitude could be measured or calculated. Longitude was a\r\nmore difficult problem; it involved the calculation of the difference\r\nof time as well as measurements of elevation of the heavenly bodies.\r\nThe calculations necessary to discover actual locations from an\r\nobservation were too long and complicated to be made on each occasion;\r\nand \"ephemerides,\" or calculated tables of elevations of planets and of\r\ndifferences of time, were required. Just when the earliest of such\r\ntables were constructed and when chronometers came into use is obscure,\r\nbut they were in existence in at least a rudimentary form early in the\r\nfifteenth century. [Footnote: Humboldt, Examen Critique, I., 274.]\r\n\r\nThe condition of Europe early in the fifteenth century as compared with\r\nits condition early in the thirteenth shows a great advance in those\r\nlines which made extensive exploration possible, and this advance was\r\nchiefly due to Italians. Increased knowledge, improved equipment,\r\ninstruments of astronomical observation, navigating charts, and a face\r\nof educated navigators, made a part of the European background of\r\nAmerican history as truly as did the incentive to exploration afforded\r\nby the search for new routes to the East. Of course much progress\r\nremained to be accomplished in the making of maps and globes, in the\r\nimprovement of instruments, and in the calculation of tables during the\r\nperiod of discovery. The awakened scientific interest which had already\r\nshown itself as part of the Renaissance found scope in the practical\r\nrequirements of distant voyages. While men were discovering new\r\ncontinents and seas, they were at the same time solving many problems\r\nof geographical science and perfecting the equipment by which further\r\nadvance was made practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPIONEER WORK OF PORTUGAL (1400-1527)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great period of explorations, of which the discovery of America was\r\na part, lay between the years 1485 and 1520, between the discovery of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope by Diaz and the circumnavigation of the globe by\r\nthe ships of Magellan. Long before this period of fruition, however,\r\nthere was a significant movement of discovery, and an important\r\nacquisition of knowledge, experience, and boldness in exploration. This\r\nearly dawn, preparatory to the later day, consisted in a series of\r\ndiscoveries on the west coast of Africa, due to the energy of the\r\nPortuguese and to the enlightenment of their great Prince Henry.\r\n\r\nPortugal was especially fitted to be the pioneer in modern maritime\r\nexploration. Without geographical or racial separation from the rest of\r\nthe Iberian peninsula, the national distinctness of Portugal was\r\nlargely a matter of sentiment gathering around the sovereign. The\r\nnationality of Portugal had been created in the first place by the\r\npolicy of its rulers, and preserved by them until the growth of\r\nseparate material interests, a national language and literature, and\r\ntraditions of glorious achievements confirmed the separateness of the\r\nPortuguese nationality from that of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe desire to hold aloof from other Spanish countries turned the\r\nattention of the king of Portugal to more distant alliances, and the\r\nopen western seaboard naturally suggested that these should be with\r\nmaritime states. In 1294 a treaty of commerce was signed with England.\r\nA century later, 1386, a much closer alliance with that country was\r\nformed and a new treaty signed at Windsor. [Footnote: Rymer, Foedera,\r\nII., 667, VII., 515-523.] This was followed in the next year by a\r\nmarriage between the king of Portugal and Philippa, daughter of the\r\nEnglish John of Gaunt and first cousin of King Richard. This \"Treaty of\r\nWindsor\" was renewed again and again by succeeding English and\r\nPortuguese sovereigns and remained the foundation of their relationship\r\nuntil it was superseded long afterwards by still closer treaty\r\narrangements. With Flanders, Portugal had frequent peaceful\r\nintercourse, both in trade and in diplomacy. A Venetian fleet also\r\ncalled from time to time at the harbor of Lisbon on the way to and from\r\nEngland and Flanders, and thus brought Portugal into contact with the\r\ngreat Italian republic, and may have aroused an interest in far Eastern\r\ntrade products of which loaded the galleys.\r\n\r\nThe contract before referred to by which Emanuel Pesagno was made\r\nhereditary lord high admiral, in 1317, continued to be fulfilled by the\r\ndescendants of the first great admiral through the whole fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, and kept up a constant connection with Genoa.\r\n[Footnote: M. G. Canale, Storia del Commercio, Viaggi, &c., degl'\r\nItaliani, book II., chap. x., etc., quoted by Payne, New World, 96.]\r\nThus the associations of Portugal were with a line of seaboard states\r\nextending from England to Italy. After 1263 the maritime interests of\r\nthe Portuguese kings became more distinct by their conquest from the\r\nMoors of the kingdom of Algarves, giving them a southern as well as a\r\nwestern sea-coast. [Footnote: Stephens, Hist. of Portugal, 81.] It was\r\nat Sagres, on Cape St. Vincent, which juts out into the open Atlantic\r\nOcean on the extreme southwest of this province, that Henry, the fifth\r\nson of John II. of Portugal, established his dwelling-place in 1419,\r\nand created a centre of maritime interest and a base of exploring\r\neffort which was of world-wide influence. Henry was duke of Viseu, lord\r\nof Cavailham, viceroy of Algarves, and grand master of the Order of\r\nChrist. He had no wife or children; his private estate was, therefore,\r\navailable for the expenses of exploring voyages; and projects of\r\ngeographical discovery became his chief occupation. Whatever other\r\nduties or services were required of him on account of his membership in\r\nthe royal family, he always returned to Sagres and to his exploring\r\nexpeditions. He possessed also the interest and support of his father\r\nand brother, who successively occupied the throne. After his death his\r\nwork was carried on by his nephew, King Alfonso V. The work of Henry\r\nwas, therefore, substantially the concern of the whole royal family of\r\nPortugal for three generations. [Footnote: Major, Prince Henry the\r\nNavigator, chaps. iv., vi., xiii., xviii.]\r\n\r\nPrince Henry \"the Navigator,\" as he has come to be called, gathered\r\naround him a body of men trained as sailors; he learned the use of\r\ncharts and instruments, taught these arts to his captains, and\r\nultimately made the neighboring port of Lagos the most famous point in\r\nthe world for the departure and return of exploring expeditions.\r\n[Footnote: Nordenskiold, Periplus, 121 A. For discussion of divergent\r\nviews of Prince Henry's \"school of navigation,\" see Beazley.] During\r\nforty years expedition after expedition was equipped almost yearly and\r\nsent down along the west coast of Africa, in the effort to solve its\r\nmystery and, if possible, to sail around its southern extremity.\r\n\r\nIn the process of exploration Prince Henry was governed by some of the\r\nstrongest of human impulses. The crusading spirit was hot within him,\r\nand he hoped to continue in Africa the old struggle of the Portuguese\r\nChristians against the Moorish infidels. Gentler missionary ideals\r\ncaused him to plan to spread Christianity into new lands, and to make\r\nconnection with Prester John, the Christian ruler of the India which\r\nlay to the eastward of Africa. [Footnote: Hakluyt Soc., Publications,\r\n1899, cvi.-cxii. Murara, Discovery of Guinea, chaps, vii., xvi.] His\r\ninterest in trade was equally strong; he was familiar with the internal\r\ntrade of Africa, and he lost no opportunity of developing traffic along\r\nthe sea-coast. [Footnote: Azurara, Discovery of Guinea, chap. vii]\r\n\r\nYet it was the instinct of the explorer that inspired Prince Henry with\r\nthe steady devotion to his life work. The fine curiosity which placed\r\ngeographical discovery above all material gain, and rewarded his\r\ncaptains, not in proportion to what they had accomplished, but in\r\nproportion to the efforts they had made to carry the boundaries of\r\nknowledge farther, kept him and them intent on the work of exploration.\r\n[Footnote: Bourne, \"Prince Henry the Navigator,\" in Essays in\r\nHistorical Criticism, 173-189.] Henry possessed, at the beginning of\r\nhis explorations, little more than the traditional geographical\r\nconceptions of the later Middle Ages. Besides some twelve or fourteen\r\nextant fourteenth-century maps drawn by Italian draughtsmen, which were\r\nprobably all known to Henry, his brother Pedro gave him one which has\r\nsince disappeared, which had been constructed at Venice, and which \"had\r\nall the parts of the world and earth described.\" [Footnote: Major,\r\nPrince Henry, 62.] He was probably also familiar with the classical\r\ntales of the circumnavigation of Africa.\r\n\r\nBesides this he had some important personal knowledge. During a\r\nPortuguese invasion of the Barbary states of Africa in 1415, in which\r\nPrince Henry served with his father and brothers, and later when he was\r\nhimself in command, he found that there were caravan routes whose\r\ntermini were at Ceuta and other Mediterranean towns. From the Sahara\r\nand the Soudan, across the desert, came caravans to the Mediterranean\r\ncoast bringing gold, wine, and slaves, and news of trading routes far\r\nto the southward.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these routes extended to rivers and seacoasts unknown to\r\nEuropeans, which must, nevertheless, be connected with the open\r\nAtlantic Ocean, and might well be on the southern shore of that\r\ncontinent. \"He got news of the passage of merchants from the coast of\r\nTunis to Timbuctoo and to Cantor on the Gambia, which inspired him to\r\nseek those lands by way of the sea.\" [Footnote: Diego Gomez, quoted in\r\nBeazley, Introduction to Azurara's Chronicle (Hakluyt Soc.,\r\nPublications, 1899).] \"The tawny Moors, his prisoners, told him of\r\ncertain tall palms growing at the mouth of the Senegal or western Nile,\r\nby which he was able to guide the caravels which he sent out to find\r\nthat river.\" [Footnote: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nThe first decade of Henry's efforts, from 1420 to 1430, resulted in\r\nlittle in the way of new discovery. The Madeira and Azores islands were\r\nrediscovered and their full exploration and permanent colonization\r\nbegun. Every year saw one or more caravels sent from Lagos southward to\r\nfollow the coast of the main-land; but they skirted no shores that were\r\nnot desert, and turned back baffled by their own fears. Cape Boyador\r\nlong remained a barrier whose imaginary dangers of reef and shoal\r\nserved as an excuse for the still more unreal horrors of the \"Sea of\r\nDarkness.\"\r\n\r\nThe next decade saw better results. In 1434 Gil Eannes, one of the\r\nboldest of the captains who were growing up in Prince Henry's service,\r\nwhen he reached Boyador, sailed far out to sea, doubled the cape, and,\r\nreturning to the coast, landed and gathered \"St. Mary's roses,\" and\r\ntook them home to the prince as a memento of the \"farthest South.\"\r\n[Footnote: Azurara, Discovery of Guinea, chap. ix.] The greatest\r\nbarrier had been passed, that of superstitious dread, and almost every\r\nvoyage now brought its result of progress farther southward. Soon the\r\nboundaries of Islam were passed, for natives were found on the coast\r\nwho were not Mohammedans.\r\n\r\nThe third decade saw still further advance. In 1441 Nuno Tristam\r\ndiscovered Cape Blanco, the \"White Cape,\" glistening with the white\r\nsand of the Sahara. In 1445 Dinis Diaz, of Lisbon, sailed at last\r\nbeyond the desert and reached Cape Verd, the \"Green Cape,\" [Footnote:\r\nIbid., chap. xxxi.] fifteen hundred miles down the African coast, and\r\nas far from Gibraltar south as Constantinople was east. By this time\r\nthe captains of Prince Henry had reached the fertile and populous\r\nshores where the western Soudan borders on the Atlantic Ocean, and a\r\nnew obstacle to further exploration revealed itself in the attraction\r\nand the profit of the slave-trade.\r\n\r\nThe first \"Moors\" or negroes were some ten or twelve captured and\r\nbrought home in the year 1441 by Antam Goncalvez, to satisfy the\r\ncuriosity of the prince and to obtain information useful for the\r\nfurther prosecution of the voyages. Others were soon brought for other\r\npurposes. Of the two hundred and thirty-five Moors who made up the\r\nfirst full cargo of human freight, the prince gave away the fifty-six\r\nwhich fell to his share as one-fifth, although it is recorded with the\r\nsomewhat grotesque piety of the fifteenth century that \"he reflected\r\nwith great pleasure on the salvation of their souls that before were\r\nlost.\" [Footnote: Azurara, Discovery of Guinea, chap. xxv.]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that Henry planned or wished the\r\ndevelopment of a trade in slaves; [Footnote: The statement to the\r\ncontrary in the Cambridge Modern Hist., I., 10, is not deducible from\r\nany contemporary evidence.] but labor was scarce on the great estates\r\nof southern Portugal, slaves were in demand, and very different desires\r\nfrom those of the prince might be gratified by capturing and bringing\r\nto the slave-market of Lagos the unfortunate natives of the newly\r\ndiscovered coasts. Hence one expedition after another, sent out for\r\npurposes of discovery, returned, bringing tales of failure to reach\r\nfarther points on the coast, but laden with human booty to be sold.\r\nPrivate adventurers sought and obtained the prince's permission to send\r\nout caravels, and these also brought home cargoes of slaves. Only the\r\nmost vigorous pressure, exercised on the choicest spirits among the\r\nPortuguese captains, served now to carry discoveries farther.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a basis of interest in distant voyages had been found\r\nwhich had not existed before; and the further exploration of the\r\nAfrican coast was certain, even in default of the personal\r\nenlightenment and enthusiasm of the Navigator. The expeditions sent by\r\nthe prince and private voyages made familiar to the mariners of\r\nPortugal two thousand miles of coast instead of six hundred as of old.\r\nGuinea was eventually reached.\r\n\r\nIn 1455 the Venetian Cadamosto entered into Henry's service; and,\r\nfollowed closely by Diego Gomez, discovered the Cape Verd Islands and\r\npassed so far around the shoulder of northwestern Africa as not only to\r\nreach the ends of the caravan routes from Morocco, and to open up trade\r\nin gold, ivory, and the products of the Guinea coast, but to suggest\r\nthat there was open sea now all the way eastward to India. The\r\ntemporary disappointment of finding that this was not true was left to\r\nthe successors of Prince Henry, for his death occurred in 1460. But the\r\nwork was still carried on by his nephew, Alfonso V., and by the next\r\nking of Portugal, John II.\r\n\r\nA series of bold pilots now passed beyond the whole Guinea coast,\r\ncrossed the equator, and made their way down almost two thousand miles\r\nmore of the African coast. The belief became assured that \"ships which\r\nsailed down the coast of Guinea might be sure to reach the end of the\r\nland by persisting to the south\"; and stone pillars six feet high were\r\nordered to be erected at landing-places to indicate possession and mark\r\nthe stages of the route to the Indies.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1486, Bartholomew Diaz, the third member of his family to\r\ntake part in the discoveries of Prince Henry, with two vessels sailed\r\nthe remaining distance on the coast, and passed so far to the eastward\r\nthat his sailors mutinied and refused to go farther. Diaz then suddenly\r\nrealized that, notwithstanding the necessity for his return, he had at\r\nlast found the passage-way to India dreamed of through so many ages and\r\nsought for at such heavy cost.\r\n\r\nA period of still greater discoveries was already at hand. \"It was in\r\nPortugal,\" says Ferdinand Columbus, \"that the admiral began to surmise\r\nthat if men could sail so far south, one might also sail west and find\r\nlands in that direction.\" The Portuguese were so wedded to the search\r\nfor the southeast route, and it was so nearly achieved at this time,\r\nthat their interest was but languid in the plans for a search to the\r\nwestward. Another people therefore took it up, and soon the exploration\r\nof the New World was in full tide, and the period of pioneer effort\r\npassed into the era of great accomplishment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Portugal saw the fruition of Prince Henry's work in the\r\ncircumnavigation of Africa. Ten years later than the exploit of Diaz,\r\nin 1496, a fleet sailed from Lisbon under Vasco da Gama which was\r\ndestined to round the Cape, make its way up the east coast of Africa\r\ntill familiar parts of the Indian Ocean were reached; then to sail\r\nacross to India, cast anchor, and secure cargo in Calicut and many\r\nother ancient ports; and to return thence safely to its port of\r\ndeparture. [Footnote: The First Voyage of Vasco da Gama, in Hakluyt\r\nSoc., Publications, 1898.] The Portuguese search for a new route to the\r\nlands of Eastern products was thus successful; and once found, this\r\npath became familiar. The fleet of Cabral in 1500 immediately followed\r\nthat of Da Gama, and, driven to the westward as it sailed to the south,\r\ndiscovered Brazil, as a casual incident of its successful voyage to\r\nIndia. Thus, if the voyage of Columbus had never been undertaken,\r\nAmerica would have been found within less than a decade.\r\n\r\nAlbuquerque followed around the southeast passage in 1503; a permanent\r\ntraffic between Portugal and India was established, and thereafter\r\nyearly fleets of merchant and war vessels rounded the Cape. Soon most\r\nof the points of vantage of the Indies were in Portuguese control--\r\nOrmuz, Diu, Goa, Ceylon, Malacca--and the enterprising little western\r\nstate had trade settlements in Burma, China, and Japan. [Footnote:\r\nHunter, Hist, of British India, I., 110-133.] The private path of the\r\nPortuguese ultimately became the public highway of the nations. Spain,\r\nHolland, England, and France sent fleets around the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nand made use of the route to the East which the Portuguese had\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe actual progress of scientific knowledge and practical equipment for\r\nnavigation made at Sagres, Lagos, Lisbon, and on the seas, during the\r\nvoyages sent out by Prince Henry and his immediate successors, is\r\nunfortunately not accurately known; but some glimpses of it may be\r\nobtained. \"In his wish to gain a prosperous result of his efforts,\"\r\nsays an almost contemporary historian, \"the Prince devoted great\r\nindustry and thought to the matter, and at great expense procured the\r\naid of one Master Jacome from Majorca, a man skilled in the art of\r\nnavigation and in the making of maps and instruments, and who was sent\r\nfor, with certain of the Arab and Jewish mathematicians, to instruct\r\nthe Portuguese.\" [Footnote: De Barros, Decadas da Asia, quoted in\r\nBeazley, Henry the Navigator, 161.]\r\n\r\nWhen trained Italian navigators applied to Henry, as was the case with\r\nthe Venetian Cadamosto, they were readily taken into his service, and\r\nhe sent word by them that he would heartily welcome any other such\r\nvolunteers. When the prince's work fell into the hands of his nephew,\r\nKing John, the latter appointed the German Behaim, of Nuremberg, who\r\nlived in Lisbon from 1480 to 1484, to be one of the four members of his\r\n\"Junto de Mathematicos.\" It was Behaim who introduced to the Portuguese\r\nthe improved ephemerides calculated by the German Regiomontanus, and\r\nprinted at Nuremberg in 1474. He also improved the astrolabe and the\r\nstaff, drew charts and made globes, and accompanied one of the West-\r\nAfrican expeditions in 1489. [Footnote: Major, Prince Henry the\r\nNavigator, 326-328.] Diego Gomez, one of Henry's captains, remarks, in\r\ndescribing his voyage of 1460, \"I had a quadrant with me and wrote on\r\nthe table of it the altitude of the arctic pole, and I found it better\r\nthan the chart; for though you see your course of sailing on the chart\r\nwell enough, yet if once you get wrong it is hard by map alone to work\r\nback into the right course.\" [Footnote: Quoted, in Beazley, Henry the\r\nNavigator, 297, 298.] Azurara also contrasts the incorrect charts with\r\nwhich Henry's sailors were provided before their explorations with\r\nthose corrected by the later observations. [Footnote: Azurara,\r\nDiscovery of Guinea, chap. Lxxvi.] His navigators, therefore, used the\r\ncompass, the quadrant, and carefully constructed charts; but their\r\nadvances in the use of this equipment are not recorded.\r\n\r\nThe first portolano to note the discoveries on the coast of Africa made\r\nby the Portuguese was that of Gabriele de Valsecca, of Majorca (1434-\r\n1439). A map drawn by Andrea Bianco, of Venice, at London in 1448,\r\nseems to have been intended especially to indicate them, as it gives\r\ntwenty-seven new names along the coast to the south of Cape Boyador.\r\nBut the map which was distinctively the outcome of the new discoveries\r\nwas the so-called \"Camaldolese map of Fra Mauro,\" drawn by Mauro,\r\nBianco, and other draughtsmen during the year 1457, in the convent of\r\nMurano in Venice. King Alfonso of Portugal himself paid the expenses of\r\nits construction, and sent charts showing the recent discoveries. It\r\nincluded all the new knowledge obtained up to that time by Prince\r\nHenry's explorers. It is the first large map drawn with the exactness\r\nand the reliance on observed facts of the portolano, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that it included a larger part of the earth's surface in its\r\nfield than any earlier map. Though disappointing in some respects, it\r\nstands in the forefront of improved modern maps, and not unworthily\r\nrepresents the advance made in the knowledge of the world's surface as\r\na result of the Portuguese efforts up to that time. The scientific\r\nimportance of the discoveries of the Portuguese and the intellectual\r\nalertness of the Italians are alike illustrated by an incident that\r\noccurred at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1491. Columbus\r\nhaving explained to the sovereigns his scheme for a western voyage to\r\nreach the Indies, most of the Spanish prelates who were present\r\ndeclared his ideas heretical, supporting themselves upon the authority\r\nof St. Augustine and Nicholas de Lyra. Alessandro Geraldini, an\r\nItalian, preceptor of the royal children, who was standing behind\r\nCardinal Mendoza at the time, \"represented to him that Nicholas de Lyra\r\nand St. Augustine had been, without doubt, excellent theologians but\r\nonly mediocre geographers, since the Portuguese had reached a point of\r\nthe other hemisphere where they had ceased to see the pole-star and\r\ndiscovered another star at the opposite pole, and that they had even\r\nfound all the countries situated under the torrid zone fully peopled.\"\r\n[Footnote: Mariejol, L'Espagne sous Ferdinand et Isabelle, 96.] In\r\nship-building Henry and his navigators made positive progress. The\r\nVenetian Cadamosto testifies that \"his caravels did much excel all\r\nother sailing ships afloat.\" Many varieties of vessels are mentioned in\r\nthe records of Prince Henry's time--the barca, barinel, caravel, nau,\r\nfusta; the galley, galiot, galeass, and galleon; the brigantine and\r\ncarrack. Of all these the caravel became the favored for the long,\r\nexploring voyages. It was usually from sixty to one hundred feet long\r\nand eighteen to twenty-five feet broad, and of about two hundred tons\r\nburden. It had three masts with lateen sails stretched on the oblique\r\nyards which were swung from the masthead, and was steered, at least\r\npartly, by the turning of these great, swinging sails. [Footnote:\r\nRevista Portuguesa, Colonial (May 20, 1898), 32-52, quoted by Beazley,\r\nIntroduction to Azurara's Chronicle (Hakluyt Soc., Publications, 1899,\r\np. cxii.).] John II. encouraged the immigration of English and Danish\r\nship-builders and carried improvements still further. The greatest\r\nservice to navigation done by Prince Henry and his successors was that\r\nof providing a school of sea-training. Not only were the whole group of\r\nearly Portuguese explorers, Henry's own captains, \"brought up from\r\nboyhood in the household of the Infant,\" [Footnote: Azurara, Discovery\r\nof Guinea, chap xiii.] but there was scarcely a name great in\r\nnavigation in the succeeding period which had not in some way been\r\nconnected with these voyages. Diaz, Da Gama, Albuquerque, Da Cunha,\r\nCabral, and the other captains who made the Portuguese empire in the\r\nEast, Magellan, who found still another way to India by the southwest;\r\nEstevam Gomez, who sailed to the arctic seas; Bartholomew and\r\nChristopher Columbus--were all taught or practised in that school.\r\nColumbus lived in Lisbon from 1470 to 1484, married there the daughter\r\nof Bartholomew Perestrello, the discoverer and captain-general under\r\nPrince Henry of Porto Santo in the Madeiras; and, besides his voyages\r\non the Mediterranean and to England and Iceland, went repeatedly to the\r\ncoast of Guinea and lived for some years in the Madeiras. Between 1477\r\nand 1484 he was regularly engaged in the maritime service of the\r\nPortuguese crown. Besides these great names, many navigators who had\r\nonly local repute or have remained nameless were Portuguese in birth\r\nand training, and belonged to the same maritime school. In 1502, close\r\nupon the English grants of exploring and trading rights to the Cabots,\r\ncame a similar concession to \"Hugh Elliott and Thomas Ashehurst,\r\nmerchants of Bristol, and to John Gunsalus and Francis Fernandez, Esq.,\r\nsubjects of the king of Portugal.\" [Footnote: Rymer, Foedera] The\r\nexpedition of the French captain De Gonneville to Brazil, in 1503, was\r\nguided by two Portuguese pilots; [Footnote: Pigeonncau, Hist du\r\nCommerce, II, 50.] and twenty of the sailors on Magellan's Spanish\r\nfleet of 1519, besides the commander, were Portuguese. [Footnote:\r\nNavarrete, Coleccion, II, 12] Three vessels from Dieppe, under\r\nPortuguese pilotage, in 1527, rounded the Cape of Good Hope and visited\r\nMadagascar, Sumatra, and the coast of India. [Footnote: De Barros,\r\nDecadas da Asia (Madrid ed., 1615), 42 decade, book V., chap, vi.,\r\n296.]\r\n\r\nActual skill in navigating vessels was increased and developed to a\r\nhigh degree in the struggle with the adverse maritime conditions on the\r\ncoast of Africa. The violent and disturbing currents, the terrible surf\r\nof the beaches, the cyclones of the Guinea coast, the trade-winds,\r\nwhich were always head-winds to the mariners returning from the south-\r\nwest, the uncharted reefs and bars, all favored a school of seamanship\r\nwhich trained the Portuguese and Italian sailors to meet far worse\r\ndifficulties than those likely to confront them in the later and more\r\ndistant voyages to the westward.\r\n\r\nOther experiences of the Portuguese were later utilized by the\r\nSpaniards in their American colonies. The slave-trade was a sombre\r\nprecedent, followed only too readily; the system of grants of newly\r\ndiscovered territory to captains or contractors who would continue its\r\ndiscovery or conquest, exploit its resources, and pay to the crown a\r\nlarge share of its products was followed, somewhat intermittently, in\r\nthe West Indies and Central and South America. [Footnote: Bourne, Spain\r\nin America, chap. xiv.]\r\n\r\nOne of the permanent lessons of the Portuguese explorations was the\r\nneed for and effectiveness of royal or quasi-royal patronage. Italian\r\nexpeditions bore no fruit and could bear none, for this requirement of\r\npatronage was but ill-afforded by her merchant cities or even by her\r\nmerchant princes. It was impossible for Venice or Genoa to take a part\r\nin the new discoveries and follow the new lines of trade, not only\r\nbecause of their unfavorable geographical position, not only because\r\nthey were then engaged in a desperate military and economic struggle to\r\nretain their old Levantine trade conquests and connections, not only\r\nbecause their wealth and prosperity were deeply smitten by their mutual\r\nstruggles and their common losses from the repeated blows of the\r\nOttoman conquest, but because Italy had no royal family to take under\r\nits patronage distant discovery, conquest, trade, and colonization.\r\nItaly furnished most of the knowledge, the skill, and the individual\r\nenterprise that made the great period of explorations; but Portugal,\r\nunder the leadership of her great prince, was its true pioneer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH MONARCHY IN THE AGE OF COLUMBUS\r\n\r\n(1474-1525)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe limits of Portuguese discovery and dominion were soon reached; and\r\nas the fifteenth century advanced, Spain emerged not only as one of the\r\ngreat powers of Europe but as the first exploring, conquering, and\r\ncolonizing nation of America. A century before any other European state\r\nobtained a permanent foothold in the New World, Spain began the\r\ncreation of a great colonial empire there, which was soon occupied by\r\nher settlers, administered by a department of her government, converted\r\nby her missionaries, and made famous throughout Europe by the wealth\r\nwhich it brought to the mother-country. Such a work at such a time\r\ncould only be accomplished by a vigorous and rising nation, and, in\r\nfact, Spanish advancement in Europe during this period corresponded\r\nclosely with her achievements in America. There are few recorded\r\ninstances of a development so rapid and a transformation so complete as\r\nthat which took place in Spain under Ferdinand and Isabella, between\r\n1474 and 1516.\r\n\r\nFor a career destined to be scarcely inferior to that any of the great\r\nempires of history, Spain had at the beginning of this period an\r\ninadequate and undeveloped political organization. Even that royal\r\npower which was the condition precedent to distant conquest and\r\ncolonial organization was new. Spanish national unity, royal\r\nabsolutism, and religious uniformity, which were famous throughout\r\nEurope in the sixteenth century, were all of recent growth; the\r\ncentralized control over all parts of her widely scattered colonies\r\nwhich Spain, above all colonizing countries, exercised, was a power\r\nattained and a policy adopted only at the moment of the acquisition of\r\nthose colonies.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1474, Isabella inherited the crown of Castille, and, in 1479,\r\nher husband, Ferdinand, became king of Aragon, they united, by close\r\npersonal and political bonds, what had formerly been near a score of\r\ndomains, variously joined or detached.\r\n\r\nThe king of Aragon had already incorporated into a personal union three\r\nseparate countries--the kingdom of Aragon, the kingdom of Valencia, and\r\nthe ancient principality of Catalonia, each with its own body of\r\nrepresentatives, its own law, its peculiar customs, and its separate\r\nadministrative systems. Castile was in name a political unity, having\r\none monarch and one body of estates. Nevertheless its provinces\r\nrepresented well-marked ancient divisions. Leon had once been a\r\nseparate kingdom, and was still coupled with Castile itself in the full\r\ntitle of that monarchy; while Galicia, Asturias, and the three Basque\r\nprovinces were inhabited by peoples of different political history, of\r\ndifferent stock, and living under different customs. Navarre, Granada,\r\nand Portugal, although within the Iberian peninsula, were, at the\r\naccession of Ferdinand and Isabella, still independent; though the\r\nfirst was destined to be united to Aragon, the second to Castile, and\r\neven the third was to be amalgamated for eighty critical years with the\r\ngreater monarchy. Thus Spain was a congeries of states, joined by the\r\nmarriage bond of the two rulers of its principal divisions, but by no\r\nmeans yet a single monarchy or a united nation. It was the work of the\r\nCatholic sovereigns to carry this unification far towards completion by\r\nfollowing common aims, by achieving success in many fields of common\r\nnational interest, and by imposing the common royal power upon all\r\ndivergent and warring classes and interests in the various Spanish\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe personality of Ferdinand and Isabella was the first great factor in\r\nthe strengthening of the monarchy; for they were both individuals of\r\nauthority, energy, and ability. [Footnote: Burgenroth, Col. Letters and\r\nState Papers, Spain, I., 34, etc.] Their union was the next element;\r\nfor the royal power of the united monarchies could be used to break\r\ndown opposition in either. Great achievements in Spain and in Europe\r\nincreased their authority and power by the prestige of success.\r\nFinally, the discoveries, conquests, and colonization of America gave a\r\nunique position to the rulers of these distant possessions. Not only\r\ndid the products of the American mines American commercial taxation\r\nfurnish a material basis of strength and influence; not only did a\r\ngreat commercial marine and a great navy grow up around the needs of\r\nintercourse with the colonies; but the romantic interest of the\r\ndiscoveries, the wild adventures, and the wonderful success of the\r\nconquistadores, and the extent of the colonies, filled the imagination\r\nand gave an ideal greatness to the monarchs in whose name these\r\nconquests were made, and by whom the New World was ruled.\r\n\r\nThere was need for all the authority of the new sovereigns at the time\r\nof their accession in 1474. Under the weak rule of Isabella's brother,\r\nCastile had become a prey to disorder amounting almost to anarchy; in\r\nGalicia brigandage was so common as to be unresisted, except by\r\ntownsmen staying within walls; in Andalusia private warfare among the\r\ngreat noble houses had let loose all the forces of disorder and\r\nviolence; Isabella's claim to the crown was disputed and her rival\r\nupheld by foreign support. [Footnote: Maurenbrecher, Studien und\r\nStudien, 45, 46.] The united sovereigns met these difficulties with\r\nvigor, and the first two years of Isabella's rule in Castile gave\r\nrepeated instances of victorious warfare, of successful assertion of\r\nauthority, and of harsh justice. The turbulent districts were reduced\r\nto order and the foreign invader expelled.\r\n\r\nThe disorder in Andalusia seemed to demand personal action. In 1477,\r\ntherefore, the two sovereigns made a formal entry into Seville, and the\r\nqueen asserted her royal power in a way that could not be\r\nmisunderstood. In true patriarchal fashion she established her tribunal\r\nin the Alcazar, sitting in a chair on an elevated platform surrounded\r\nby her council and officers, in all solemnity and according to\r\ntraditional forms, listening to the complaints of high and low, rich\r\nand poor, and granting summary justice to all who claimed it,\r\nirrespective of rank or means. Her decrees were carried out, ill-doers\r\nforced to make amends, and turbulent nobles reduced to promising to\r\nkeep the peace. The visit of Isabella to Seville may well be taken as\r\nthe beginning of the work of the new monarchy in Spain. [Footnote:\r\nPerez, Los Reyes Catolicos in Sevilla, 1477-1478, p. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe next step towards an enforcement of royal authority taken by the\r\nnew monarchs involved the acknowledgment of an institution seemingly\r\nindependent of the monarchy. Spanish cities and communes had at various\r\ntimes formed hermandads, leagues or brotherhoods, to enforce order, to\r\nsupport themselves against great nobles, or to strengthen themselves\r\nfor the carrying out of some object of common policy. Instances could\r\nbe found in which their combined strength had been used against the\r\nking himself or his officials. On the other hand, their united power\r\nhad been used efficaciously to form a sort of rural police, each city\r\nundertaking the protection of certain roads and stretches of country.\r\n[Footnote: Antequera, Hist. de la Legislacion Espanola, 194-197.]\r\n\r\nTwo influential ministers, with the approval of Ferdinand and Isabella,\r\nin 1476, obtained the agreement of the Cortes of Castile and of a junta\r\nof the towns for the formation of a santa hermandad, or \"holy\r\nbrotherhood,\" for three years, for which rules were drawn up, submitted\r\nto the monarchs, and filially promulgated. The nobles gave a reluctant\r\nassent to the requirements of these rules, so far as they affected\r\ntheir estates and vassals. Altogether two thousand horsemen were to be\r\nequipped, each horseman supported by a body of one hundred households.\r\nThese were grouped into companies under eight captains and placed in\r\ndetachments at certain distances along all the roads. Besides the armed\r\nsoldiers of the brotherhood, a whole system of alcaldes was organized\r\nwith exclusive jurisdiction over certain kinds of offences. A common\r\ntreasury existed for the support of expenses.\r\n\r\nWhen any theft, assault, arson, or rape was discovered or complained\r\nof, immediately the bells Were rung, and the nearest detachment of\r\nsoldiers of the brotherhood started on a pursuit which was carried to\r\nthe boundaries of the next district, where its detachment took up the\r\npursuit, and so on until the culprit was seized or the boundaries of\r\nthe kingdom reached. No town, house, or castle could refuse the right\r\nof search. When arrested, a decision of the nearest alcalde was given\r\nwithin five days. If convicted, the culprit had hand or foot cut off or\r\nwas put to death. The favorite mode of execution in earlier times had\r\nbeen to bind the offender to a stake, and shoot him with arrows \"till\r\nhe died naturally\"; but Isabella required that he should be hanged\r\nfirst, and that only then might his body be used as a target and a\r\nwarning for others. The rapidity of pursuit and the certainty of\r\ncapture of offenders, the promptitude of justice, and the barbarism of\r\nthe punishments made a strong impression; and the combination of\r\npopular vengeance with official sanction made the hermandad an\r\neffective form of national police. It was introduced into Aragon in\r\n1488.\r\n\r\nAlthough this system seemed to emanate from the people, the general\r\ncontrol over it was preserved by Ferdinand and Isabella by placing in\r\ninfluential positions in its administration trusted ministers of their\r\nown, and by joining themselves in its organization. When its work of\r\ninsuring order was measurably accomplished and the people began to\r\ncomplain of its expense, the sovereigns were able to transfer the\r\nmilitary force into a contingent for the Moorish war, and the treasury\r\ninto an addition to the commissariat for the same purpose. In 1498 it\r\nwas reduced to the proportions of a petty and inexpensive local police.\r\nIt had proved itself, as utilized by these strong monarchs, a means of\r\nobtaining order and recruiting an army without cost to the royal\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nThe vigor of the royal administration, however, expressed itself rather\r\nin the development of purely royal organs than in those which were so\r\nlargely popular as the hermandad. A group of royal councils became,\r\nunder Ferdinand and Isabella, the most powerful instruments of the\r\nroyal will, the most effective means for obtaining additional power and\r\nbeating down all opposition. Early in the reign, the old royal council,\r\nwhich traditionally consisted of twelve members, including\r\nrepresentatives of each of the three orders of the state, was\r\nreconstituted so as to consist of one ecclesiastic, three nobles, and\r\neight or nine letrados, or lawyers. [Footnote: Cortes de los Antiguos\r\nReinos, 112, etc.] The last class, who made up its majority, were men\r\nlearned in the Roman law, and therefore devoted to the idea of absolute\r\nmonarchy; without connection with the church or the nobility, and\r\ntherefore interested in the strengthening of the kingship against both;\r\nshrewd, trained, capable, and hard working.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the council, in constant attendance on the king,\r\nwell organized, provided with a corps of clerks and officers, and\r\nholding daily sessions, became the serviceable and effective auxiliary\r\nof royal power. It had duties of consultation, advice, and in some\r\ncases decision, on matters of internal and external policy, of\r\nlegislation and administration; and, in fact, of action in the whole\r\nsphere of the affairs of state. In time the council was gradually\r\nsubdivided into three bodies: the Council of Justice, the Council of\r\nState, and the Council of the Finances, whose functions were indicated\r\nby their titles. The first of these was, in a certain sense, the direct\r\nrepresentative of the old single royal council, and was frequently\r\nknown as the Council of Castile. Its president was always considered\r\nthe highest personage in the kingdom, next the king; its members were\r\nof that class of letrados whom the king could most securely rely on,\r\nand to it fell the duty of enforcing the royal supremacy as against all\r\nancient claims, privileges, and liberties.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these outgrowths from the primitive council of the king,\r\nnew councils were created from time to time, analogous in powers, but\r\nholding oversight over special spheres of national interest. Some of\r\nthese were temporary, others permanent. Among them were the Council of\r\nthe Hermandad, which lasted only for the twenty-two years of the\r\nexistence of that institution; the Council of the Suprema, or of the\r\nInquisition; the Council of the Military Orders, the Council of the\r\nIndies, and the Council of Aragon. [Footnote: Antequera, Hist. de la\r\nLegislation Espanola, 347, 348.] These great administrative boards were\r\na characteristic part of the Spanish system of government, a natural\r\noutgrowth of its wide-spread fields of action.\r\n\r\nThe Council of the Indies was constituted in 1511, under the presidency\r\nof Juan de Fonseca, archdeacon of Seville, and was exactly analogous to\r\nthe other councils. It accompanied the king, and had under him all\r\nultimate control in policy, in jurisdiction, and in legislation over\r\nthe Spanish possessions in America and in the East. Its members were\r\nhabitually drawn from those men who had had experience as public\r\nservants in the West Indies or in the Philippines. The more direct\r\noversight of individual voyages to the Indies, the regulation of\r\ndetails of colonial affairs, and a large sphere of general activity\r\nwere possessed by the powerful Casa le Contractacion at Seville. A\r\nBureau of Pilots also existed, whose office it was to collect nautical\r\ninformation, provide charts, and give assistance to Spanish navigators.\r\nBut both of these offices were under the control of the Council of the\r\nIndies. [Footnote: J. de Veitia Linage, The Spanish Rule of Trade to\r\nthe West Indies, trans. by Captain J. Stevens, book I., chap. iii.]\r\n\r\nAll these councils were stronger in discussion than the execution;\r\ntheir archives came to include a vast mass of records and special\r\nreports on subjects falling within their respective fields, and their\r\nprocedure favored penetrating investigation and full debate. But\r\ndecision was hard to come at, and the consciousness that final decision\r\nafter all rested with the king paralyzed effectiveness. The custom of\r\nsubmitting all questions of policy to investigation by the appropriate\r\ncouncil became invariable in later Spanish history, and it resulted in\r\ncumbrous ineffectiveness. Interminable inquiry and discussion ended\r\nfrequently only in suspension of judgment or a divided report. Points\r\nof policy of imminent importance had to await a dilatory investigation\r\nand equivocal conclusions. This impotence of the central organs of\r\ngovernment did not come in the time of Ferdinand and Isabella and their\r\nimmediate successors, and the growing inefficiency of the councils was\r\nlong overcome by the resolution of the monarchs. Nevertheless the\r\nsystem was part of the price paid for centralized government, acting\r\nindependently of local initiative or independence.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of power that was being obtained by the sovereigns in\r\nthe affairs of central government by means of the royal councils was\r\ngained in the local affairs of provinces, towns, and communes, by the\r\nappointment of corregidores. Such officials were appointed from time to\r\ntime by earlier sovereigns to represent them in various towns, but the\r\nsystem had never been extended widely. In 1480 the king and queen sent\r\none or more corregidores into every self-governing town and city in\r\nCastile where such officials did not exist already. [Footnote: Pulgar,\r\nCronita de los Reyes, II., chap. xcv.] They were to act alongside of\r\nthe older local regidores and alcaldes as special representatives of\r\nthe crown, defending its rights and claims, and fulfilling its duties\r\nof general oversight and protection. As a matter of fact, the great\r\nwork they accomplished was the enforcement of royal supremacy over\r\nlocal privileges. Little by little they extended their powers and\r\nencroached upon the local self-government, bringing to bear all the\r\nweight of the central government upon local conditions. [Footnote:\r\nMariejol, L'Espagne sous Ferdinand et Isabelle, 172-174.] The steady\r\npressure of the corregidores was supplemented by the periodical visits\r\nof the pesquidores, veidores, or inspectors, whose duty it from time to\r\ntime to visit the various localities, examining into the conduct of the\r\ncorregidores and other officials, listening to complaints against them,\r\nreporting on the revenues, condition of the roads, and other local\r\nconditions and needs.\r\n\r\nCouncils, corregidores, inspectors, and various other instruments of\r\nroyal power fast sapped the strength of older institutions and gave\r\nauthority and efficiency to the royal government; but they were\r\nexpensive and the crown was poor. Moreover, these institutions were\r\nonly the permanent elements in a policy which had a thousand temporary\r\noccasions of expense. Not even Ferdinand and Isabella could carry out\r\nso vigorous a regime unless provided with larger revenues. They\r\ndetermined, therefore, to emancipate the crown from its poverty. A few\r\nyears after their accession they felt themselves strong enough,\r\nsupported by the representatives of the towns, in the Cortes of Toledo,\r\nto convoke the great nobles and churchmen of the kingdom and demand\r\nfrom them an investigation into the conditions under which the ancient\r\ndomains of the crown had been alienated. [Footnote: Pulgar, Cronica de\r\nlos Reyes, II, chap. xcv.; Calmeiro, Introduction to Cortes de los\r\nAntiguos Reinos, II., 63, 64.] The Cardinal Pedro de Mendoza and the\r\nqueen's confessor, Ferdinand de Talavera, were appointed to judge of\r\nthe propriety of the gifts of former sovereigns. They did their work so\r\nadequately that pension after pension, estate after estate, endowment\r\nafter endowment, were resumed by the crown. These resumptions were\r\nprincipally to the loss of the great noble families which had enriched\r\nthemselves at the expense of the crown. None, it is true, were\r\nimpoverished thereby, but a more normal relation of comparative income\r\nbetween sovereign and subject was established in the process.\r\n[Footnote: Mariejol, L'Espagne sous Ferdinand et Isabelle, vi., 24.]\r\nAnother and more permanent addition to the royal income was made by the\r\nabsorption into the crown of the grand masterships of the three\r\nmilitary orders which existed in Castile, the Knights of Santiago, of\r\nCalatrava, and of Alcantara. In the course of three centuries of\r\nconquest from the Moslems these orders had added estate to estate,\r\nterritory to territory, town to town, benefice to benefice, till their\r\npossessions extended widely through Spain, their income perhaps\r\nequalled that of the king, and their rule as landlords extended over\r\nalmost a million people, or one-third the population of Castile.\r\n[Footnote: Vicente de la Fuente, Hist Generale de Espana, V., 79.] At\r\nthe head of each of these orders was a grand master, whose rich income,\r\nmilitary following, and prestige made him one of the greatest nobles in\r\nEurope. There was reason in the claim that these grand masterships were\r\nantagonistic to royalty. Those who held them were the most turbulent\r\nnobles of Spain, and in earlier times had been the leaders in many a\r\nrevolt against the crown. Their military system was co-ordinate with,\r\nand sometimes in conflict with, that of the king; their estates\r\nsurrounded royal fortresses and sometimes excluded royal forces from\r\nfrontier districts.\r\n\r\nIn 1487 when the grand mastership of the order of Calatrava became\r\nvacant, Ferdinand presented himself in the chapter of the commanders of\r\nthe order, exhibited a papal bull giving him the administration of the\r\norder, and forced the assembly to elect him grand master. In 1494, with\r\nless formality, the grand master of Alcantara was induced to resign to\r\nthe king his office, receiving, in recompense, the dignity of\r\narchbishop of Seville. Two years later, when the grand master of the\r\norder of Santiago died, Ferdinand had himself elected without\r\ndifficulty. [Footnote: Maurenbrecher, Studien und Skizzen, 54.] Some\r\ntime after this Isabella issued a pragmatic decree, declaring that the\r\ngrand masterships of the orders should always be annexed to crown.\r\nThese dignities were of great value; not only did they bring in a\r\nprincely income, but they practically extended the estates and\r\npatronage of the crown by all the broad lands, cities, and villages,\r\nthe offices, honors, and benefices with which the piety and chivalry of\r\nthree centuries had endowed the orders.\r\n\r\nWhen once such foundations had been laid, the crown extended rapidly\r\nits aggressions upon the old powers, privileges, and customs of classes\r\nand local bodies. To the nobility were interdicted the possession of\r\nfortified castles, the practice of private warfare, the use of\r\nartillery, the duel, [Footnote: Mariejol, L'Espagne sous Ferdinand et\r\nIsabelle, 35.] the use of quasi-royal formulas in their documents,\r\n[Footnote: Cortes de los Antiguos Reinos, IV., 191, 192.] and other\r\nproud old feudal customs. No slight influence was exercised upon the\r\nnobility by the increasing ceremony, size, and expenditure of the\r\ncourt, to which they came to be attached in positions of nominal\r\nservice and honorable dependence, a position altogether favorable to\r\nthe supremacy of the monarchs and unfavorable to the independence of\r\nthe nobility.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the consolidation of royal power went the creation of\r\nthe territorial unity of the Spanish peninsula. The greatest step was\r\nthe conquest of Granada. Rich, warlike, and proud, this ancient Moorish\r\nstate resisted the persistent attacks of the Catholic sovereigns for\r\neleven years, from 1481 to 1492. [Footnote: Prescott, Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, chap. ix.] At least once Ferdinand wearied of the struggle\r\nand the expense, and longed to turn the efforts of the united Castilian\r\nand Aragonese arms eastward, where the natural ambitions of his own\r\nkingdom drew him towards France, Italy, and the islands of the\r\nMediterranean. [Footnote: Mariejol, L'Espagne sous Ferdinand et\r\nIsabelle, 63.] Isabella's determination, however, never wavered, and in\r\n1492 Granada opened her gates to her conquerors, the Moorish dynasty\r\ndisappeared from Spain, and their mountains and plains were added to\r\nthe kingdom of Castile.\r\n\r\nIn the very next year Ferdinand reunited to his dominions, by amicable\r\ntreaty with the king of France, the two northern provinces of\r\nCatalonia, Cerdagne and Roussillon--which had been detached for thirty\r\nyears. There remained Portugal and Navarre. The first of these\r\nindependent kingdoms had already attained a degree of national\r\nindependence, power, and wealth which prevented its absorption, though\r\nit was in the days of Spain's greatest power to be dragged for eighty\r\nyears in her train. Navarre, balanced on the Pyrenees, had long been\r\ndrawn alternately to France and to Aragon. In the closing years of the\r\nfifteenth and the opening years of the sixteenth century, neutrality\r\nbecame impossible; and in 1512 a powerful Spanish army under the duke\r\nof Alva marched into Navarre; its castles and towns capitulated, the\r\nlatter under a promise of the maintenance of their privileges; the king\r\nretreated to the trans-Pyrenean part of his kingdom, and Ferdinand\r\nadded to his other titles that of king of Navarre. [Footnote:\r\nBoissonade, Reunion de la Navarre a la Castille.] By the time of the\r\ndeath of Ferdinand, the unity of the peninsula, except for Portugal,\r\nwas complete. The immediate successors of the Catholic sovereigns wore\r\nthe crowns of all the countries that ever have made part of Spain.\r\n\r\nJust as Spain became territorially one, she was made homogeneous in\r\nrace and religion so as ultimately to become a land of one race and one\r\nfaith. The Jew and the Moor were both destined to disappear; every\r\nelement alien in blood and every element unorthodox in religion to be\r\ndriven out of the land. This complete purity of blood and unity of\r\nbelief were only attained long afterwards, in a period when Spain had\r\nlittle else than her orthodoxy to pride herself upon, but they were\r\nwell begun in the time of the Catholic sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe Jews were the first to meet with serious persecution. They were\r\nvery numerous: in one town, Ciudad Real, an assessment at one time\r\nshowed 8828 heads of families, or other adult males of the Jewish race.\r\n[Footnote: Lea, The Moriscos of Spain, 383.] They were famous as\r\nphysicians and merchants, and, as in other lands, were often money-\r\nlenders. From time to time waves of religious antagonism swept over the\r\ncountry, and under the terrible pressure of slaughter and imminent\r\ndanger, great numbers of Jews were baptized and became conversos, or\r\n\"New Christians.\" These converts, freed from the disabilities of their\r\nreligion and gifted with superior natural abilities, rapidly attained\r\nto high positions in church and state. Intermarriages between the New\r\nChristians and those of Castilian blood were frequent, and many\r\nfamilies of great eminence had Jewish blood in their veins.\r\n\r\nThe conversos were under constant suspicion of being Christians only\r\nformally; it was believed that in their hearts they retained their\r\nancient faith and secretly performed its rites; they were credited with\r\nantagonism to Christianity and suspected of practising sorcery to\r\ndestroy the \"Old Christians.\" There was some basis for the first, at\r\nleast, of these suspicions. Many doubtless failed to abandon completely\r\ntheir ancestral ceremonies; and not only they but even some Old\r\nChristians felt the attraction of their mysterious and ancient\r\ntraditions. [Footnote: Mariejol, L'Espagne sous Ferdinand et Isabelle,\r\n44.] The practice of Jewish rites, known as \"Judaizing,\" under the wide\r\nrelationships and high connections of the conversos, long went on\r\nunchecked. In 1475 the pope conferred on his legate in Castile full\r\ninquisitorial powers to prosecute and punish \"Judaizing\" Christians;\r\nbut the mandate was not carried out. [Footnote: Lea, in Am. Hist. Rev.,\r\nOctober, 1895, p. 48.]\r\n\r\nIn 1480, however, the Catholic sovereigns requested from the pope\r\nauthorization for the appointment by themselves of inquisitors to root\r\nout this heresy. A bull for the purpose was granted them, and on\r\nSeptember 27, 1480, the Spanish Inquisition was established at Seville.\r\nIn January, 1481, it began its work, and branches were gradually\r\nestablished in other centres till it had extended its tribunals to\r\ncover all Castile. Its work proved heavy; in its first eight years the\r\ntribunal of Seville alone put to death seven hundred persons and\r\ncondemned five thousand more to severe penalties. [Footnote: Bernaldez,\r\nHist. de los Reyes, chap. xliv., quoted by Mariejol, L'Espagne, 46.]\r\nOne of the great councils of the realm was formed to direct its\r\noperations, at the head of which was the inquisitor-general. The third\r\nin the line of inquisitors-general extended the Inquisition to America.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Inquisition extended only over baptized persons;\r\nand, therefore, Jews who had never given up their religion, although\r\nunder many disabilities, were not subject to its jurisdiction; but\r\nimmunity to unconverted Jews could not consistently be continued during\r\na harsh persecution of Judaizing Christians, and from the commencement\r\nof the work of the Inquisition pressure was brought to bear by clergy\r\nand populace upon the sovereigns to force all Jews either to be\r\nbaptized or to emigrate. [Footnote: Lea, Religious History of Spain,\r\n437.] The policy of enforced conversion or expulsion was steadily\r\nadvocated by the inquisitors; since, if the Jews were baptized they\r\nwould come under the jurisdiction of the Inquisition; if they left the\r\ncountry, Spain would be free from the reproach of harboring heretics.\r\n\r\nIsabella seems to have hesitated to carry out this policy, as well she\r\nmight. But the tide of popular hatred rose higher and higher, driven on\r\nby the famous case of El Santo Nino de la Guardia, the reputed murder\r\nof a Christian child by Jews to obtain its heart for purposes of\r\nsorcery. [Footnote: Lea, Religious History of Spain, 437-468.] Finally,\r\nby the edict of March 31, 1492, all Jews were expelled from Spain, as\r\nthey had been from England as early as 1290, and successively from many\r\nother states of Europe at intervening periods. [Footnote: Amador de los\r\nRios, Los Judios de Espana y Portugal, III., 603.] The same year that\r\nsaw the discovery of America and the capture of Granada saw the\r\nexpulsion of some one hundred thousand Jews and the enforced baptism of\r\nthe fifty thousand that remained. [Footnote: Isidore Loeb, in Revue des\r\nEtudes Juives, 1887, p. 182, quoted in Lea, The Moriscos of Spain, 16.]\r\nOne great and costly step had been made in the direction of unity of\r\nrace and religion in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Moors in Spain were still more numerous than the Jews, though more\r\nconcentrated. Through the later mediaeval centuries, in the process of\r\nreconquest, Moorish populations which made formal surrender were\r\npreserved as subjects of the Christian kings; while those that were\r\ntaken prisoners in battle were retained as slaves. Both classes,\r\nprotected by the laws in their religion and their property, [Footnote:\r\nLas Siete Partidas, pt. i., tit. v., ley 23, etc., quoted in Lea, The\r\nMoriscos of Spain, 2.] frequently still practised their Mohammedan\r\nfaith. Practically the whole rural population of the kingdom of\r\nValencia was Moorish, and in the cities of the southern provinces of\r\nCastile they made a considerable part of the population. In the century\r\nand a half of peace just preceding the war with Granada they increased\r\nsteadily in numbers and in economic value to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Granada, in 1492, brought the population of that\r\ncountry under the rule of Ferdinand and Isabella. The old body of\r\nMoorish subjects of Aragon and Castile, now reinforced by all the\r\nteeming population of the south, made an element of the population of\r\nunited Spain of infinite promise. They were skilful, industrious,\r\ntemperate, and moral; their agriculture and manufactures were far more\r\nadvanced than those of the Christians, and they were more laborious,\r\nthrifty, and peaceable. They might be relied upon to furnish through\r\ntaxation a steady and abundant income to the crown, and through their\r\nlabor to make the landed estates of the nobles profitable.\r\n\r\nThough treaty guarantees and the permanent material interests of the\r\nnew sovereigns alike favored the protection and pacification of the\r\nMoorish inhabitants of Granada, other motives antagonized this policy.\r\nReligious enthusiasm and racial antipathy, as well as immediate greed,\r\nurged a disregard of the terms of capitulation, or, at least, such an\r\ninterpretation of them as would drive the Moors either to conversion or\r\nexile. The latitudinarianism of earlier centuries had disappeared. The\r\nwhole spirit of the time was now averse to tolerance or anything\r\napproaching local, national, or religious independence. At first, under\r\nTalavera, a sincere, earnest, and partially successful effort was made\r\nto convert the Moors individually to Christianity; but soon a demand\r\narose and became ever more urgent that the Moors, like the Jews, should\r\nbe given the simple and immediate alternative of baptism or exile. In\r\n1500 this policy was adopted in Granada; in 1502, by royal edict signed\r\nby Isabella, it was applied to all the dominions of the Castilian\r\ncrown; and in 1525 it was promulgated in Aragon, Valencia, and\r\nCatalonia. As a result many of the Moors emigrated to Africa; the rest\r\nbecame Moriscos--that is to say, Christians in religion, although Moors\r\nin blood. Thus religious uniformity was attained in Spain. In theory,\r\nat least, every inhabitant of the united kingdom was a Catholic\r\nChristian. But the enforced Christianity required of the Moriscos\r\nproduced only an outward and imperfect conformity, and the problem of\r\nthis alien element remained long unsolved to plague the Spanish\r\nmonarchs, and to bring untold misery on the Moriscos themselves.\r\n[Footnote: Lea, The Moriscos of Spain, chaps. v.-xi.]\r\n\r\nThus the fragmentary and embryonic group of Iberian nations of the\r\nfifteenth century grew into the powerful Spanish monarchy of the\r\nsixteenth. A single centralized government was created, and the divided\r\ncurrents of national life were gathered by it into one great stream.\r\nNotwithstanding many survivals of mediaeval conditions and later\r\nreversions to the earlier type, internal warfare and domestic disorder\r\ndisappeared from the peninsula, and divergence of foreign policy no\r\nlonger weakened its influence in Europe. The absolute monarchy was\r\nfounded, and whatever there was of ability, enterprise, and wealth in\r\nSpain came under its control. The sovereign was in a position to give\r\npatronage to voyages of adventure, to legislate for distant dominions,\r\nand to make the most remote Spanish possessions contributory to the\r\ngeneral objects of Spanish policy.\r\n\r\nSpain stood out as one of the greatest states in Europe. With her close\r\napproximation to a united nationality, her all-powerful monarchy, her\r\nhighly elaborate bureaucracy, her increasing body of law, soon to be\r\ncodified into a great whole, her nascent literature, her military gifts\r\nand resources, the wealth and romance of the Indies, she stood on the\r\nthreshold of the sixteenth century with imposing power and dignity. The\r\npart she played during that century was a conspicuous one. Her generals\r\nand her troops became the most famous and the most successful in\r\nEurope. Her diplomatic representatives were able to take the highest\r\ntone and to win most successes among European states, in the\r\ninternational intrigues of the sixteenth and early seventeenth\r\ncenturies. She was rich enough to pension or bribe the ministers and\r\ncourtiers of half the courts of Europe, and even to dazzle the eyes and\r\nimpose upon the judgment of such a sovereign as James I. of England.\r\nHer literature and her art flourished with her political greatness, and\r\nshe had all the external appearance of a great, cultured, and\r\nflourishing nation.\r\n\r\nWe know now, as was recognized by some observers even then, that Spain\r\nwas a hollow shell. After the reign of Charles V. population stood\r\nstationary, or declined, and wealth decreased. Philip II. enforced\r\northodoxy, excluded all non-Catholic literature, and summoned home all\r\nSpanish students in foreign universities, thus dooming Spain to\r\nintellectual stagnation. She exhausted her resources in unwise or\r\nhopeless foreign struggles, like the war of conquest of Italy and the\r\neffort to reconquer the Netherlands; she wasted her peculiar\r\nopportunities by driving from her borders the enterprising Jews and\r\nindustrious Moriscos, and by allowing commerce and finance to fall into\r\nthe hands of foreigners. But most of these errors were, at the death of\r\nFerdinand, in 1516, still in the future; and the Spanish monarchy and\r\nnation had much of the reality as well as the appearance of greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF CENTRAL EUROPE (1400-1650)\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerica's political and social institutions are unquestionably founded\r\nupon those of England, and these will be described in their proper\r\nplace in this volume. But the institutions of three other European\r\nnations were for considerable periods dominant in certain parts of the\r\nNew World, and have left an impress that is even yet far from being\r\neffaced. They are those of Spain, France, and Holland.\r\n\r\nSince the Indies were, in theory, an outlying part of the kingdom of\r\nCastile, they naturally reflected the recently achieved absolutism of\r\nthe Spanish monarchy. This absolutism in Castile extended over all\r\nfields--legislation, judicial action, and administrative control.\r\nAlthough the most formal and permanent statutes were drawn up by the\r\nking with the consent of the cortes, or even at its request, yet the\r\ncustom of issuing pragmatica, or ordinances enacted by royal authority,\r\ngrew until their provisions filled a large sphere. They were\r\npromulgated on all sorts of subjects, and became, immediately on their\r\nissue, authoritative rules of action. The whole subsequent legislation\r\nfor the American colonies, springing as it did from the mere will of\r\nthe sovereign, was an outcome of this custom.\r\n\r\nThe king was the fountain of justice, in whose name or by whose grant\r\nall temporal jurisdiction was exercised. In no country of Europe was\r\nthis principle more clearly acknowledged than in Spain. Immediately\r\nattending upon him was an audiencia, or group of judicial officers\r\nwhose duty it was to carry out these functions in the most immediate\r\ncases. The audiencia was a high court of law and equity, deciding both\r\ncivil and criminal cases; and, as is always the case in early stages of\r\ngovernment, exercising much administrative and financial control\r\nthrough the forms of judicial action. The insufficiency for these ends\r\nof a peripatetic body bound to follow the king in all his movements was\r\nearly recognized, and the royal audiencia was made stationary at\r\nValladolid. Later a second such court was established, first at Ciudad\r\nReal, then, after the conquest, at Granada. Ultimately others were\r\norganized in Galicia, Seville, Madrid, Burgos, and several additional\r\ncentres. The system was early transported and extensively developed in\r\nthe American possessions, where twelve independent audience existed.\r\nThere, as at home, this court system gradually superseded the more\r\nindividual and military rule of the adelantado, which had been\r\ncharacteristic of the early conquest period. [Footnote: Moses, Spanish\r\nRule in America, 66, etc] The adelantado was the representative of the\r\nadministrative powers of the crown. Five such officials in the\r\nfifteenth century governed respectively the provinces of Castile, Leon,\r\nGalicia, Andalusia, and Murcia; another was appointed over Granada when\r\nit was conquered; and still another administered the temporal affairs\r\nof the vast estates of the archbishopric of Toledo. Their duties were\r\npartly military, partly civil, and under them were subordinate royal\r\nofficers with a great variety of titles such as sarjento mayor, alferez\r\nreal, alcalde. The title of adelantado was naturally given to Columbus,\r\nPizarro, and several of the other early conquistadores as the nearest\r\nequivalent to their position as civil and military governors of the\r\nwide-spreading, newly conquered lands of America. [Footnote: Moses,\r\nSpanish Rule in America, 68, 69, 113.] The supremacy of the crown\r\nextended to the church as well as to the state. Spain, in the Middle\r\nAges and far into modern times, presented the anomaly of a nation and\r\ngovernment most ardently devoted to orthodox Christianity and to the\r\nchurch, and yet jealous and impatient of the powers of the Pope. In\r\n1482 Isabella protested against the use of a papal provision for the\r\nappointment of a foreign cardinal to a Castilian bishopric, and claimed\r\na right to be consulted in all ecclesiastical appointments. A serious\r\ncontest ensued, the ultimate result of which was that the queen\r\nobtained a clear right of appointment, which, in the reign of Charles\r\nV., was formally recognized as such by the pope. [Footnote: Vicente de\r\nla Fuente, Hist Generate de Espana, V, 150, quoted in Mariejol,\r\nL'Espagne sous Ferdinand et Isabelle, 28.]\r\n\r\nThis position of the monarchs at home made easy and natural the\r\nadoption of their position of supreme patrons of the church in Spanish\r\nAmerica. In the colonies conquered, settled, and Christianized under\r\ntheir influence they had a completeness of control, not only over\r\nappointments, but over the establishment of new church centres and the\r\ndisposition of the titles to ecclesiastical property generally, which\r\nwas quite unknown anywhere in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the crown in Spain is evidenced in no way more\r\nmarkedly than by its entire freedom from dependence on the military and\r\nlanded classes of the country. Yet the nobility were numerous, rich,\r\nand distinguished. In the sixteenth century there were twelve dukes,\r\nthirteen marquises, and thirty-six counts in Castile, some of whom had\r\nprincely estates and power. The heads of such families as that of\r\nMendoza or Gruzman or Lara or Haro or Medina Celi were among the\r\ngreatest men in Europe. Yet the highest of these nobles was still an\r\nimmeasurable distance below the king. The option of royal estates, the\r\nseizure of the grand masterships, the enforcement and extension of all\r\nlatent powers of the monarchy had freed the Spanish kings from all\r\ndanger of control by the great nobility.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of the Castilian nobility, however, was not\r\nits wealth, but its numbers. Next in rank to the great nobles, or ricos\r\nhombres, were the caballeros, the knights, and below them was a vast\r\nnumber of hidalgos, mere gentlemen. In Castile all were accounted\r\ngentlemen who were sons of gentlemen, legitimate or illegitimate; all\r\nthose who took up their residence in a city newly conquered from the\r\nMoors, providing themselves with horse and arms without engaging in\r\ntrade; those who lived without trade in certain provinces and cities\r\nwhich had that privilege. Whether rich or poor, those who belonged to\r\nthe noble class had many privileges: they paid none of the general\r\ntaxes; they were free from imprisonment for debt; they had the\r\npreference in appointments to office in state and church; they had\r\nprecedence on all public occasions; and, except in case of treason or\r\nheresy, they had the privilege in case of execution of being\r\ndecapitated instead of hanged. [Footnote: Mariejol, L'Espagne sous\r\nFerdinand et Isabelle, 278-284.]\r\n\r\nThese hidalgos and caballeros, many of them poor, living on inadequate\r\nestates, in service to other nobles or in irregular ways in the towns,\r\nfurnished promising material for volunteer forces in war, for distant\r\nconquest, and for an expanding government service; but they were weak\r\nelements of economic progress. The conquistadores of Spanish America,\r\nthe soldiers in Italy and the Netherlands, and the drones of Spain were\r\nall to be found among the teeming lower Spanish nobility and gentry.\r\nThey made admirable soldiers. With all their pride and all their\r\nindolence, Spanish gentlemen were not too proud to fight, even in the\r\nranks and afoot; or too lazy to endure effort and privation when they\r\nwere for a military end. The Spaniards as a race were then, as now,\r\nabstemious, and could make long marches on a slender commissariat. Many\r\nof them were used to the extremes of heat and cold of the mountainous\r\nregions of their native country, and were fitted for the most trying of\r\nlong campaigns, All the material was ready to the hand of the king for\r\nuse in his European campaigns, or to be let loose for adventure in\r\nAmerica. With this acknowledged position of legislative, judicial,\r\nadministrative, and ecclesiastical supremacy at home; with the headship\r\nof a numerous, loyal, and warlike nobility; with the possession of a\r\nnumerous trained official class, it was easy for the Spanish monarchs\r\nto impose a centralized and homogeneous system of despotic government\r\nupon the distant and widespread colonies of America.\r\n\r\nThe assertion of the absolute authority of the king over the Indies was\r\nnever neglected or allowed to lapse. The adventurers who discovered and\r\nexplored the West Indies, Central and South America, Mexico, and much\r\nof what is now territory of the United States; the captains who\r\nconquered these lands; the governors who organized and ruled them; the\r\ncolonists who occupied them--all drew their permission so to act from\r\nthe king, or if they went beyond their commissions quickly legitimated\r\ntheir actions by an appeal to him for an act of indemnity and a more\r\nadequate commission. Foreigners were by the edict of the king excluded\r\nfrom the Spanish possessions, or permitted a narrow field of action\r\nthere; the policy of the colonies in matters of trade, relations with\r\nthe natives, religion, and finance was dictated by the king. Upon the\r\nadvice of his Council of the Indies he issued a continuous series of\r\nrules and ordinances, and finally drew up for the American possessions\r\nthe \"New Laws.\"\r\n\r\nYet supreme over her colonies as was the absolute monarchy of Spain, a\r\nfalse idea of their condition would be obtained if it were forgotten\r\nthat the monarchy was only one of the national institutions. Other\r\npolitical habits of the people were firmly established as well as that\r\nof subserviency to the crown. Spain was the classic land of\r\nparticipation of all classes in government through the cortes; almost\r\nas old as the monarchy were the fueros, or franchises and charters;\r\nprotected by these fueros, the cities and towns had become numerous,\r\npowerful, and almost self-governing; and even rural communities had in\r\nmany cases a complicated and semi-independent system of control of\r\ntheir own affairs.\r\n\r\nThe cortes may be neglected here, since no such representative body\r\never arose in the colonies; but the same is not true of local self-\r\ngoverning municipalities. Not only were they characteristic of Spain,\r\nbut analogous institutions were established as a Spanish population\r\ngrew up and was organized in the Indies, where there was a strong\r\ntendency to revert to practical self-government and thus to defeat the\r\ncentralizing policy of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred cities, towns, and rural communities in Spain held\r\nfueros granted to them by the king, a great noble, or some\r\necclesiastical body. These charters in many cases dated from the\r\neleventh or twelfth century and conceded the most extensive rights and\r\nprivileges. Under them townsmen could surround themselves with a wall,\r\norganize a military force, elect their own magistrates, judge their own\r\ninhabitants, collect their own taxes, pay only a fixed sum to the\r\ncrown, and in other ways live almost as a separate political body under\r\nthe general protection only of the king. [Footnote: Antequera, Hist. de\r\nla Legislation Espanola, 128-139.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding many differences among the towns in size, character,\r\nand political privileges, among those of Castile there was a certain\r\nsimilarity of organization which may be described as follows, and may\r\nbe looked upon as the type on which municipalities in Spanish America\r\nwere originally constructed. [Footnote: Bourne, Spain in America, chap.\r\nxv.]\r\n\r\nThe citizens who possessed full political rights were known in the most\r\ngeneral sense as vecinos; when acting as electors they were spoken of\r\nas forming the concejo, cabildo, or council. The actual body which met\r\nand directed municipal affairs was the ayuntamiento, made up of the\r\nmore important magistrates and officials, of whom there was usually a\r\nconsiderable number and variety. The alcaldes exercised judicial\r\nfunctions, both civil and criminal; the regidores had charge of the\r\nadministrative work of the community; the corregidores of its oversight\r\nin the interest of the king; the alguazil mayor commanded the military\r\nforces; the mayor domo had the oversight of the town property. In some\r\ntowns one or more of the alcaldes had the title of alcalde mayor, and\r\nheld a presiding function. There were various lower officials, such as\r\nalarifes, rayones, and others in great variety. [Footnote: Antequera,\r\nHist. de la Legislation Espanola, App. ix., 542.] The town officials\r\nwere in some cases appointed by the king, in others elected by the\r\nvecinos, in still others divided between royal and local appointment.\r\nThey were usually drawn from the body of the citizens, but in some\r\ncases from gentlemen or even noblemen who had houses in the town or\r\nsimply owned property there.\r\n\r\nThis municipal organization and certain other ancient institutions\r\ntended to reappear in the colonies, and thus to modify and limit that\r\nabsolutism of the central government which was without doubt the\r\nleading characteristic of the Spanish colonial system. The provincial\r\ninterests of the colonists also opposed the monarchy. The great\r\ndistance of the colonies from Spain, the rigidity of official custom,\r\nthe difference between the interests of the colonists and the desires\r\nof the government, and the lack of vigor at home combined to prevent a\r\nreally effective control of the colonies. \"Obedezcase, pero no se\r\ncumpla\" (Let it be obeyed, but not enforced) was a saying sufficiently\r\ndescriptive of the attitude of the colonies towards unpopular decrees\r\nfrom home.\r\n\r\nThe servitude of men of dependent races, which became such a\r\nfundamental characteristic of Spanish America, is an instance of this\r\nincompleteness of control by the central government. Slavery was a\r\nproduct of American conditions and was not general in the mother-\r\ncountry. A small number of Moorish slaves captured in war and of\r\nnegroes imported through Portugal were scattered through Spain, but\r\nthey did not form a class, and were protected rather than depressed by\r\nthe law. [Footnote: Lea, The Moriscos of Spain, 2.]\r\n\r\nSlavery in America was always distasteful to the home government, and\r\nonly reluctantly permitted because of the apparent necessities of the\r\ncase and in the hope of ameliorating the lot of the Indians. The whole\r\nplan of the asiento was based on the principle of regulating and\r\nlimiting slavery. The shameful extermination of the native races of the\r\nWest Indies is a long, sad history of kindly intentions and wise\r\nregulations on the part of the home government, made nugatory by the\r\ndetermined self-interest and heartless cruelty of the colonists.\r\n[Footnote: Lea, \"The Indian Policy of Spain\" (in Yale Review, August,\r\n1899); Bourne, Spain in America, chap. xviii.] The fervor of Las Casas\r\ncould readily obtain from the Spanish monarchs proclamations declaring\r\nthe freedom of the Indians and even definite statutes providing for\r\ntheir good treatment; but neither his fervor nor the monarch's power\r\ncould secure the enforcement of the laws or save the miserable natives.\r\n[Footnote: Lea, \"The Indian Policy of Spain\" (Yale Review, August,\r\n1899), 132, 135, 138, 141, 143. etc]\r\n\r\nIn theory the Spanish sovereigns ruled the Indies with an autocratic\r\nsway. In practice the colonies were governed by a bureaucracy or, more\r\ncommonly, allowed to drift. Yet by the forms of Spanish rule they were\r\ndeprived of all wholesome local freedom, of all power of independent\r\naction, and of all deliberate choice of their own policy. They did not,\r\ntherefore, develop during their colonial period a robust provincial\r\nlife and character; and only late and with great difficulty did they\r\nstruggle into independence and obtain self-government. [Footnote:\r\nPaxson, The Independence of the South-American Republics, chap. i.]\r\n\r\nThe institutions of France which were transferred to the New World or\r\nwhich exercised a direct influence on its political development belong\r\nto a period a century or a century and a half later than those of Spain\r\nwhich have just been described. Yet during that period there had been\r\nno essential alteration in the general direction of political\r\ndevelopment in France, and the system which Canada reflected in the\r\nseventeenth century was a more elaborate rather than a different system\r\nfrom that of the sixteenth. This development had, indeed, been in\r\nprogress since the Hundred Years' War, and consisted in the steady rise\r\nof the power of the centralized monarchy. In Spain we have seen a\r\nsudden growth of absolutism and centralization within one reign. In\r\nFrance the foundation of the absolute monarchy was laid earlier, it was\r\nconstructed more uniformly, and the resulting edifice was more firm and\r\nsymmetrical.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the royal household, the sub-division of the royal\r\ncouncils, the creation of the parlements, [Footnote: Lavisse, Histoire\r\nde France, V., pt. i., 215.] the appointment of governors of provinces,\r\nbailiffs, and intendants, and the establishment of a complicated\r\nhierarchy of financial and judicial officers and official bodies,\r\n[Footnote: Ibid., V., 247.] were processes which arose from the\r\nfundamental conditions of France and from the genius of her government.\r\nIn this development there were periods of rapid growth, as that of\r\nFrancis I.; of temporary reaction, as that of the religious wars. Of\r\nthe periods of the former none was more important and definitive than\r\nthat which was in progress during the years in which Canada was\r\nstruggling into existence--that is to say, the reigns of Henry IV. and\r\nLouis XIII., from 1589 to 1643. By the latter date, that of the\r\naccession of Louis XIV., the work was accomplished. France was, in\r\ntheory and in practice, a despotism. It was so in theory, for Louis\r\nhimself could declare, \"All power, all authority, are in the hand of\r\nthe king, and there can be none other in the kingdom than those which\r\nbe established there.\" The epigram attributed to that monarch, \"L'etat,\r\nc'est moi,\" was not an exaggerated description of the royal functions,\r\naccording to the views of the king and of his most thoughtful\r\nministers. \"The ruler ought not to render accounts to any one of what\r\nhe ordains. ... No one can say to him, 'Why do you do thus?'\" said\r\nBossuet. In his copy-book as a child Louis XIV. was taught to write,\r\n\"To kings homage is due; they do what they please.\" In practice the\r\nabsolute power was no less a reality, since by royal decree the king\r\nnot only made war and peace, determined upon foreign and internal\r\npolicy, established religion, and codified law, but also disposed of\r\nthe property of his subjects through arbitrary taxation. A systematic\r\nscheme of government, in which all lines should converge upward to the\r\nsovereign, could be drawn more justly for France in the seventeenth\r\ncentury than for any political structure since the Notitia Dignitatum\r\nwas drawn up for the later Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe royal government was as simple territorially as it was in\r\nfunctions. It extended over all the territory of France and of the\r\nFrench possessions beyond the seas. Instead of a collection of\r\nprovinces, of some of which the king was direct ruler, of others only\r\nfeudal lord, as had been his position in the fourteenth century, he was\r\nnow king equally over every one of his subjects in every part of his\r\ndominions. The administration of this territory had been transferred\r\nfrom its feudal lords to the king by the appointment in the fifteenth\r\ncentury of governors of the provinces, whose position was almost that\r\nof viceroys.\r\n\r\nAn even more effective instrument of royal control was afterwards\r\ncreated in the form of the intendants. Dating in their beginning from\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, reintroduced by Henry IV. in his\r\nreconstruction of France after the religious wars, [Footnote: Rambaud,\r\nHist. de la Civilisation Francaise, I., 537.] these officials were\r\nsettled upon by Richelieu in the period between 1624 and 1641 as the\r\nprincipal agents and representatives of royal power. Eventually each\r\nprovince had its intendant alongside of the governor, and these thirty-\r\nfour officials exercised the real government over France. They were\r\ndrawn not from the great nobility, as were the governors, but from the\r\npetty nobility or purely official class; they had no local connections\r\nor interests apart from the crown which they served; they could be\r\nremoved at will; they exercised powers only by consent and direction of\r\nthe crown; they were, therefore, absolutely dependent. On the other\r\nhand, they were habitually invested with powers of almost unbounded\r\nextent. They could withdraw cases from the ordinary judges and hear and\r\ndecide them themselves; they recruited and organized the army; they had\r\noversight of the churches, the schools, roads, canals, agriculture,\r\ntrade, and industries; they must see that peace was kept; and they must\r\nwatch over and report on the actions of all other royal officials in\r\nthe province, including the governor. It was the intendant who made the\r\ndespotic government of the king a reality. John Law declared, in a\r\nletter to D'Argenson, that \"this kingdom of France is governed by\r\nthirty intendants.\"\r\n\r\nThis despotism undoubtedly made France great, but it cost a terrible\r\nprice. Like all supreme powers, it was jealous, and suffered no other\r\npublic institutions to exist alongside of it. In competition with its\r\npower all older bodies became weak. The Estates General did not meet\r\nagain after 1614; the parlements humbled themselves; provincial,\r\nmunicipal, and communal governments dropped into obscurity; the\r\nindividual man, unless he was a functionary, lost all habit of\r\npolitical initiative, independence, or criticism. The mighty machine of\r\nthe government was too vast, too complicated, and too distant for the\r\ncommon man to do aught but submit himself to it and lose much of his\r\nindividual force thereby.\r\n\r\nEnforced orthodoxy in religion was a natural outcome of the unity and\r\nsymmetry of government; hence, notwithstanding the large number of\r\nHuguenots, the economic value of the Protestant element in the\r\npopulation, and the tolerance which might be expected from so\r\nenlightened a government, the Edict of Nantes was repealed in 1685,\r\nand, theoretically at least, all the population of France and of the\r\nFrench possessions were after this time orthodox Catholic Christians,\r\nthus again obtaining uniformity, but at the price of almost irreparable\r\nloss of population and of activity of mind.\r\n\r\nYet alongside this supreme despotic government had been preserved\r\ncertain relics of feudalism. The sovereigns and great ministers who had\r\nhumbled the aristocracy did not wish to humiliate it. While depriving\r\nthe nobles of all political power they had carefully preserved to them\r\ntheir social privileges. This was done partly by giving them a favored\r\nposition in the administration of the great machine of centralized\r\nroyal government, partly by allowing the continuance of old feudal\r\nprivileges. To the nobles were reserved all the higher positions in the\r\narmy, navy, civil service, administration of the provinces, and in the\r\nchurch; [Footnote: Rambaud, Hist. de la Civilisation Francaise, II.,\r\n75-78.] and the government of French possessions beyond the seas was in\r\nalmost all cases given to noblemen.\r\n\r\nOf the feudal privileges of the nobility a number were profitable in\r\nmoney or gratifying to pride. Every landed noble had some degree of\r\njurisdiction, frequently that of \"high, mean, and petty justice\"--that\r\nis to say, the right of trying and settling a large variety of judicial\r\nmatters among his tenants; his right of punishment extending in some\r\ncases even to the infliction of the death penalty. He had the right to\r\nreceive certain payments upon every sale or lease of the lands of any\r\ninhabitant of his fief; he received fees upon sales of cattle, grain,\r\nwine, meat, and other articles within the limits of his lands; he alone\r\nhad the privilege of hunting and fishing or of collecting a fee for\r\ngranting the privilege to others; and he alone could keep a dove-cote\r\nor a rabbit-warren; he had the banalites--i.e., the right of requiring\r\nall tenants on his estates to grind their grain at his mill and to bake\r\nat his oven; he had corvees--the right to a certain amount of unpaid\r\nlabor from his tenants; his land was exempt from the taille, the most\r\nburdensome of taxes; and he had many other and diverse seigneurial\r\nrights, often, indeed, more vexatious to the tenant than they were\r\nprofitable to the seigneur. [Footnote: Rambaud, Hist. de la\r\nCivilisation Francaise, II., 84-90.] These rights of land-holders were\r\nsurvivals from an earlier period; but they were survivals which still\r\nhad great value and considerable vitality. Although permitted to exist\r\nby the absolute monarchy, they were in reality antagonistic to it in\r\nspirit, and might at any time, and actually did, become a serious\r\ndisadvantage to it. Among the more primitive surroundings of Canada\r\nthese privileges of a landed aristocracy obtained new life and vigor,\r\nand feudalism played a conspicuous if not a leading part in the\r\ntroubled history of that colony. [Footnote: Parkman, The Old Regime in\r\nCanada, chaps. xii.-xv.]\r\n\r\nOf the political institutions of Holland not so much need be said, for\r\nNew Netherland was a commercial not a political creation, the factory\r\nof a trading company, not a self-governing colony. Yet, under the\r\ngeneral control of the West India Company, municipal institutions were\r\nestablished at Manhattan, and in the form of the patroonships feudal\r\npowers were granted to large landholders along the Hudson and Long\r\nIsland Sound; and in both these cases the models were drawn in large\r\npart from the home land.\r\n\r\nThe United Netherlands was a confederation of seven provinces, Holland\r\nbeing far the most influential. But Holland itself, as was true of the\r\nothers, was in many respects a confederation of municipalities. The\r\npeculiar history of the country had been such that from a comparatively\r\nearly period the towns and cities had obtained charters from their\r\noverlord, the count of Holland, or from lesser noblemen, granting them\r\nthe most extensive rights and privileges. These rights had continued to\r\nbe extended till the power of the count within the towns was narrowly\r\nrestricted. His representative was the schout, but that official\r\nexercised rather a prosecuting and executing than an independent power,\r\nbringing offenders before a town court, [Footnote: Davies, History of\r\nHolland, I., 77.] and carrying out its judgments.\r\n\r\nThe schepens who made up this court, with two or more burgomasters and\r\na certain number of prominent citizens, organized as a council or\r\nvroedschap, carried on the affairs of the city, making its laws,\r\nexercising its jurisdiction, and administering its finances in almost\r\nentire independence of the central government. [Footnote: Fruin,\r\nGeschiedniss der Staatsinstellingen in Nederland,68, 69.] The\r\nrepresentatives of the larger towns, along with the deputies of the\r\nnobles, also made up the states of Holland, any one city having the\r\nright of veto in any proposed national action. [Footnote: Davies,\r\nHistory of Holland, I, 85.] Outside of the towns the open country was\r\neither domains of the count, or fiefs held from him by church\r\ncorporations or nobles. On the latter many old feudal powers survived\r\nthrough the sixteenth century. The nobles exercised always low and\r\nsometimes high jurisdiction, they taxed their own tenants, they carried\r\non private war with other nobles, and they enjoyed an exemption from\r\nthe payment of taxes. The feudal conditions in these rural domains and\r\nthe highly developed internal organization of the cities seem at first\r\nglance diametrically opposed; but, after all, their relation to the\r\ncentral government was much the same, the city being treated as a fief\r\nheld by its council; [Footnote: Jameson, in Magazine of Am. Hist.,\r\nVIII., chap, i, 316.] and as a matter of fact it was these two\r\ninstitutions which were introduced into New Netherland. [Footnote:\r\nO'Callaghan, Documentary History of New York, I., 385-394.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SYSTEM OP CHARTERED COMMERCIAL COMPANIES\r\n\r\n(1550-1700)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe priority of Portugal and Spain in distant adventure did not secure\r\nthem from the competition of the other nations of Europe, whose\r\nawakening activity, ambition, and enterprise perceived clearly the\r\nadvantages of the New World and of the new routes to the south and\r\neast. Almost within the first decade of the sixteenth century an\r\nEnglishman cries out: \"The Indies are discovered and vast treasures\r\nbrought from thence every day. Let us, therefore, bend our endeavors\r\nthitherwards, and if the Spaniards or Portuguese suffer us not to join\r\nwith them, there will be yet region enough for all to enjoy.\"\r\n[Footnote: Lord Herbert (1511), quoted in Macpherson, Annals of\r\nCommerce, II., 39.] Soon England, France, and the Netherlands were\r\nsending exploring and trading expeditions abroad, and somewhat later\r\nthey all aimed at colonial empires comparable with that of Spain. These\r\ncolonial settlements were chiefly made for commercial profit and\r\ndepended closely on a new and peculiar type of commercial organization,\r\nthe well-known chartered companies. It was these companies which\r\nestablished the greater number of American colonies, and the ideals,\r\nregulations, and administrative methods of corporate trading were\r\ninterwoven into their political fabric.\r\n\r\nRevolutions in commerce have been as frequent, as complete, and, in the\r\nlong run, as influential as have been revolutions in political\r\ngovernment. Europe in the fifteenth century had a clearly marked and\r\nwell-established method of international commerce; yet before the\r\nsixteenth century was over a fundamentally different system grew up,\r\nwhich was destined not only to characterize trade during the next two\r\nhundred years, but, as has been said, to exercise a deep influence on\r\nthe settlement and government of colonies in general and on the policy\r\nof their home governments.\r\n\r\nA complete contrast exists between international trade in 1400 and\r\n1600. The type of commerce characteristic of the earlier period was\r\ncarried on by individual merchants; that belonging to the later period\r\nby joint-stock companies. Under the former, merchants depended on\r\nmunicipal support and encouragement; under the latter they acted under\r\ncharters received from national governments. The individual merchants\r\nof the earlier period had only trading privileges; the organized\r\ncompanies of the later time had political powers also. In the fifteenth\r\ncentury the merchants from any one city or group of cities occupied a\r\nbuilding, a quarter, or fondaco, in each of the foreign cities with\r\nwhich they traded; in the seventeenth they more usually possessed\r\nindependent colonies or fortified establishments of their own on the\r\ncoasts of foreign countries. In the earlier period trading operations\r\nwere restricted to Europe; in the later they extended over the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe essential elements of the organization of trade at the period\r\nchosen for this description are its individual character, its\r\nrestriction to well-marked European limits, and its foundation upon\r\nconcessions obtained by town governments.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the fifteenth century there were five principal\r\ngroups of trading cities, whose merchants carried on probably nine-\r\ntenths of the commerce of Europe. These groups were situated: (1) in\r\nnorthern Italy; (2) in southern France and Catalonia; (3) in southern\r\nGermany; (4) in northern France and Flanders; (5) in northern Germany.\r\nTwo of them were in the south of Europe, and found their most\r\nconsiderable function in transmitting goods between the Levant and\r\nEurope; the Hanse towns of northern Germany, at the other extremity of\r\nEurope, carried the productions of the Baltic lands to the centre and\r\nsouth; the Flemish and south German groups, intermediate between the\r\ntwo, exchanged among themselves and transmitted goods from one part of\r\nEurope to another. There were of course, vast differences of\r\norganization among the trading towns. Venice and Cologne, Barcelona and\r\nAugsburg, Bruges and Lubeck were too far separated in distance,\r\nnationality, the nature of their trade, and the degree of their\r\ndevelopment to have the same institutions. And yet there were many\r\nsimilarities.\r\n\r\nThe city authorities obtained for their citizens the privileges of\r\nbuying and selling within certain districts and under certain\r\nrestrictions, and very frequently of having their own warehouses,\r\ndwelling houses, and selling-places. Examples are to be found in the\r\nfondachi of Venice, Genoa, and other Italian, French, and Catalan\r\ncities, established in the Greek and Mohammedan districts of the\r\neastern Mediterranean, on the basis of grants given by the rulers of\r\nthose lands and cities. Just as characteristic examples can be found in\r\nwestern Europe; in London the \"Steelyard\" was a group of warehouses,\r\noffices, dwellings, and court-yards owned jointly by the towns of the\r\nHanseatic League, and occupied by merchants from those towns who came\r\nto England to trade under the concessions granted them by the English\r\ngovernment. [Footnote: Lappenberg, Geschichte des Hansischen Stahlhofes\r\nzu London.] The south Germans had their fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venice,\r\nand the north Germans their \"St. Peter's Yard\" in Novgorod. The\r\nVenetian merchants trading to the city of Bruges usually met for\r\nmercantile purposes in the house of a Flemish family named Van de\r\nBurse, a name which is said to have given the word \"bourse\" to the\r\nlanguages of modern Europe. [Footnote: Mayr, in Helmolt, History of the\r\nWorld, VII., 81.]\r\n\r\nThe union among the merchants of any one city or league was one for\r\njoint trading privileges only, not for corporate investment or\r\nsyndicated business. Each merchant or firm traded separately and\r\nindependently, simply using the warehouse and office facilities secured\r\nby the efforts of the home government, and enjoying the permission to\r\ntrade, exemption from duties, and whatever other privileges might have\r\nbeen obtained for its merchants by the same power. The necessity for\r\nobtaining such concessions arose from the habit of looking at all\r\ninternational intercourse as to a certain degree abnormal, and of\r\ndisliking and ill-treating foreigners. Hence the Germans in London, the\r\nVenetians in Alexandria, the Genoese in Constantinople, for instance,\r\nneeded to have permission respectively from the English, the Mameluke,\r\nand the Greek governments to carry on their trade. Although they found\r\nit highly desirable for many reasons to hold a local settlement of\r\ntheir own in those cities, such a possession was not a necessary\r\naccompaniment of the individual and municipally regulated commerce of\r\nthe thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. Where but a few\r\ntraders made their way to any one market, and that only irregularly,\r\nthey lodged with natives, sold their goods in the open market-place,\r\norganized no permanent establishment, and had no consulate. On the\r\nother hand, where trade was extensive and constant, the settlement was\r\nlike a part of the home land located in the midst of a foreign\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nAs the fifteenth century progressed many influences combined to bring\r\nabout a change in this system. The most important one of these\r\ninfluences was the growth of centralized states in the north, centre,\r\nand west of Europe. As Russia, Denmark, Sweden, England, Burgundy, and\r\nFrance became strong, the self-governing cities within these countries\r\nnecessarily became politically weak; and the trading arrangements they\r\nhad made among themselves became insecure. Strong nationalities were\r\nimpatient of the claims of privilege made by foreigners settled or\r\nhabitually trading in their cities; the interests of their own\r\ninternational policy often indicated the desirability of either\r\nfavoring or opposing bodies of merchants, which in the time of their\r\nweakness the governments had treated with exactly the opposite policy;\r\nfinally, the desire of their own citizens for the advantages of their\r\nown foreign trade often commended itself to the rulers as an object of\r\nsettled policy. [Footnote: Schanz, Englische Handelspolitik.] In other\r\nwords, national interests and municipal interests were often opposed to\r\none another.\r\n\r\nInternal difficulties in many cities and internal dissensions in the\r\nleagues of cities helped to weaken the towns as guarantors of the trade\r\nof their citizens. As a result of these political influences, before\r\nthe fifteenth century was over the distribution of commerce was much\r\nchanged and municipal control was distinctly weakened. The Italian and\r\nthe German cities became less active and wealthy, while London, Lisbon,\r\nAntwerp, and many other centres grew richer. Individual cities and even\r\nleagues of cities ceased to be able to negotiate with other\r\nmunicipalities or with potentates to obtain trading privileges for\r\ntheir citizens, since such matters were now provided for by commercial\r\ntreaties formed by national governments. One of the main\r\ncharacteristics of earlier commerce, its dependence on city\r\ngovernments, thus passed away.\r\n\r\nThen came the opening up of direct commerce by sea with the East\r\nIndies, the discovery of America, and the awakening of ambition,\r\nenterprise, and effort on the part of new nations to make still further\r\nexplorations and to develop new lines of commerce. The old organization\r\nof commerce was profoundly altered when its centre of gravity was\r\nshifted westward to the Atlantic seaboard, and Europe got its Oriental\r\nproducts for the most part by an ocean route. Cities which had for ages\r\nhad the advantage of a good situation were now unfavorably placed.\r\nVenice, Augsburg, Cologne, and a hundred other towns which had been on\r\nthe main highways of trade were now on its byways. Many of these towns\r\nmade strenuous, and in some cases and for a time successful, efforts to\r\nconform to the new conditions. [Footnote: Mayr, in Helmolt, History of\r\nthe World, VII, 64-66.] Vigorous industry, trade, and commerce\r\ncontinued to exist in many of the old centres, and some of the most\r\nfamous \"merchant princes\" of history, such as the Fuggers and the\r\nMedici, built up their fortunes in the old commercial cities in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Nevertheless, these were the\r\nexception rather than the rule, and such successes were due to\r\nfinancial rather than commercial operations. In a general sense the old\r\ncommerce of Europe, so far as it followed its accustomed lines,\r\nsuffered a grievous decline. More important than the decay of the old\r\nmethod was the growth of the new. A vast mass of new trade came into\r\nexistence; spices and other Oriental products, now that they were\r\nimported by the Portuguese and afterwards by Spanish, Dutch, French,\r\nand English, by direct routes and by water carriage, were greatly\r\ncheapened in price, and thus made attainable by many more people and\r\nmuch more extensively consumed. The early explorers of America failed\r\nto find either the route to the East or the Eastern goods which they\r\nsought, but they found other articles for which a demand in Europe\r\neither already existed or was ultimately created. Sea-fish abounded on\r\nthe northeastern coasts of America to a degree that partially made up\r\ntheir loss to the disappointed seekers for a northwest passage. Whale\r\noil and whalebone were obtained in the same waters. Dye-woods, timber,\r\nand ship stores were found on the coasts farther south. Furs became one\r\nof the most valued and most permanent imports from America. Gradually,\r\nas habits in Europe changed, other products came to be of enormous\r\nproduction and value. Sugar stands in the first rank of these later\r\nproducts; tobacco, cocoa, and many others followed close upon it. As\r\ncolonists from Europe became established in the New World they must be\r\nprovided with European and Asiatic goods, and this gave additional\r\nmaterial for commerce. Besides creating an increased commerce with the\r\nEast and a new commerce with the West, the awakened spirit of\r\nenterprise and the new discoveries widened the radius of trade of each\r\nnation. Men learned to be bold, and the merchants of each European\r\ncountry carried their national commerce over all parts of Europe and\r\nfar beyond its limits to the newly discovered lands. English, Dutch,\r\nFrench, and Danish merchants met in the ports of the White Sea and in\r\nthose of the Mediterranean, and competed with one another for the\r\ncommerce of the East and the New World. Trading to a distance was the\r\nchief commercial phenomenon of the sixteenth century, and was more\r\ninfluential than any other one factor in the transformation of commerce\r\nthen in progress. Distant trading proved to have different requirements\r\nfrom anything that had gone before: it needed the political backing of\r\nsome strong national government; it needed, or was considered to need,\r\na monopoly of trade; and it needed the capital of many men.\r\n\r\nThese requirements were not felt in Portugal and Spain as they were in\r\nthe other countries of Europe, because each of those countries had\r\ncontrol of an extensive and lucrative field of commerce, and because in\r\nthem government itself took the direction of all distant trading. The\r\nPortuguese monopoly of the trade with the coast of India and with the\r\nSpice Islands was practically complete. Through most of the sixteenth\r\ncentury her ships alone rounded the Cape of Good Hope; her only rivals\r\nin trade in the East were the Arabs, who had been there long before\r\nher, and their traffic was restricted to a continually diminishing\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nUntil Portugal was united with Spain in 1580, and after that until\r\nHolland broke in on the Portuguese-Spanish monopoly of the East Indies\r\nin 1595, her control of Eastern commerce was as nearly perfect as could\r\nbe wished. [Footnote: Cunningham, Western Civilization, II., 183-190.]\r\nGovernment regulation of this commerce extended almost to the entire\r\nexclusion of individual enterprise. The fleets which sailed to the East\r\nIndies were determined upon, fitted out, and officered by the\r\ngovernment, just as those of Venice were. [Footnote: Saalfeld,\r\nGeschichte des Portugessche Kolonialwesens, 138, etc., quoted in\r\nCunningham, II., 187.] The Portuguese annual fleet sent to the Indies\r\ncounted sometimes as many as twenty vessels. In the one hundred and\r\nfifteen years between 1497 and 1612 eight hundred and six ships were\r\nsent from Portugal to India, [Footnote: Hunter, Hist. of British India,\r\nI., 165.] all equipped for the voyage and fitted out by the government\r\nwith cannon and provided with armed forces.\r\n\r\nThe management of the fleet was in the hands of the government office\r\nknown as the Casa da India. The merchants who shipped goods in these\r\nvessels and brought cargoes home in them were, it is true, independent\r\ntraders, carrying on their business as a matter of private\r\nenterprise;[Footnote: Cunningham, Western Civilization, II., 187.] but\r\nthey were subject to government regulations at every turn and supported\r\nby government at every step. At first foreign merchants were admitted\r\nto the Eastern trade under these conditions, but subsequently it was\r\nrestricted to Portuguese, and ultimately became a government monopoly.\r\nUnder this system Lisbon became one of the greatest commercial cities\r\nof the world. Venetian, Florentine, German, Spanish, French, Dutch, and\r\nHanse merchants took up their residence in Lisbon, purchased East\r\nIndian goods from the merchants who imported them, and dealt in other\r\nimports and exports resulting from this activity of trade.[Footnote:\r\nMayr, in Helmolt, History of the World, VII., 70.] In Spain the\r\ngovernment regulation of commerce was scarcely less close. All goods\r\nwhich were sent from Spain to America must be shipped from the one port\r\nof Seville, and they must be landed at either one or other of two\r\nAmerican ports--Vera Cruz, in Mexico, or Portobello, on the Isthmus of\r\nPanama. Two fleets were sent from Seville each year, one for each of\r\nthese destinations. All arrangements for these fleets, all licenses for\r\nthose who shipped goods in them, and all jurisdiction over offences\r\ncommitted upon them were in the hands of the government establishment\r\nof the Casa de Contractacion at Seville. [Footnote: Veitia Linage,\r\nSpanish Rule of Trade to the West Indies, book I., chap. iii.] No\r\nintruders were allowed in the Spanish colonies; the only persons who\r\ncould take part in the trade were merchants of Seville, native or\r\nforeign, who were specially licensed by the government. Monopoly as\r\nwell as government support was thus secured to the distant traders\r\nbetween Spain and her colonies in the West and in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred years this system of government fleets in Portugal and\r\nSpain was kept almost intact. Since the government provided merchants\r\nwith military defence and economic regulation, since it minimized\r\ncompetition among them and guaranteed to them a monopoly of commerce in\r\nthe regions with which they traded, there was small need of\r\norganization or of a union of forces among them. Consequently\r\ncommercial companies are almost unknown in Portuguese and Spanish\r\nhistory. [Footnote: Moses, Spanish Rule in America, 166-171.] In Spain\r\nand Portugal government control of trade was at a maximum. In the other\r\ncountries of Europe, notwithstanding occasional plans for such control,\r\nas in the Netherlands in 1608, [Footnote: Jameson, Usselinx,43.] the\r\npart which government took in commercial matters was much less, the\r\npart taken by private merchants was far greater. In fact, many of the\r\nearliest trading ventures were of an almost purely individual\r\ncharacter. The patent given by Henry VII. to the Cabots in 1497,\r\nsimilar letters granted in 1502 to certain merchants of Bristol,\r\n[Footnote: Rymer, Faidera (2d ed.), XIII., 37.] a grant to Robert\r\nThorne in 1527, the long series of authorized expeditions from 1575 to\r\n1632 in search of the northwest passage, the charters given to Humphrey\r\nGilbert in 1578 and to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584, and many other\r\npatents made out in the sixteenth century to prospective colony\r\nbuilders, all were granted to individuals or to groups of loosely\r\norganized adventurers. [Footnote: Brown, Genesis of the United States,\r\nI., 1-28.] In contrast both with government--controlled commerce and\r\nwith purely private trading and enterprise, the chartered companies of\r\nEngland, Holland, France, Sweden, and Denmark arose. They were by no\r\nmeans self-controlled and independent companies; they were dependent on\r\ntheir governments for many rights and privileges and for constant\r\nsupport, protection, and subsidy. On the other hand, the governments\r\nexpected them not only to develop a profitable trade but to furnish\r\ncertain advantages to the nation, such as the creation of colonies, the\r\nincrease of shipping, the provision of materials for use in the navy,\r\nthe humiliation of political rivals, the preservation of a favorable\r\nbalance of trade, and ultimately the payment of imposts and the loan of\r\nfunds. They stood, therefore, midway between unregulated individual\r\ntrading, in which the government took no especial interest, and that\r\ncomplete government organization and control of trade which has been\r\ndescribed as characterizing the policy of Portugal and Spain.\r\n\r\nSome fifty or sixty such companies, nearly contemporaneous, and on the\r\nsame broad lines of organization, are recorded as having been chartered\r\nby the five governments mentioned above, a few in the second half of\r\nthe sixteenth century, the great proportion within the seventeenth\r\ncentury. [Footnote: Some are enumerated in Cawston and Keane, Early\r\nEnglish Chartered Companies, a still larger number in Bonnassieux, Les\r\nGrandes Compagmes du Commerce.] Of course, some of these companies were\r\nstill-born, never having gone beyond the charter received from the\r\ngovernment; some existed only for a few years; and some were simply\r\nreorganizations. The formation of these companies marks a distinct\r\nstage of commercial development, and furnishes a valuable clew to the\r\nfoundation and early government of European colonies in America.\r\n\r\nEngland, Holland, France, Sweden, and Denmark, as well as Scotland and\r\nPrussia, each had an \"East India Company\"; Holland, France, Sweden, and\r\nDenmark each had a\" West India Company\"; England, Holland, and France\r\neach had a \"Levant\" or \"Turkey Company\"; England and France each had an\r\n\"African Company\"; and a date might readily be found in the seventeenth\r\ncentury when all these were in existence at the same time. The\r\nfollowing list of such companies shows their number and simultaneity.\r\nThe list cannot claim to be exhaustive or absolutely accurate, for the\r\nhistory of many such organizations is extremely obscure, the dates of\r\ntheir foundations questionable, and some companies chartered at the\r\ntime were, perhaps, not commercial in their nature.\r\n\r\n1554.

(French) Santo Domingo Company.\r\n\r\nWhen the English commercial companies were to be chartered, it was not\r\nnecessary to invent an entirely new type of organization. A model\r\nalready existed ready to hand in the Society of Merchants Adventurers,\r\nof which the origin goes back certainly to the fifteenth century,\r\nperhaps still earlier. [Footnote: Lingelbach, Brief Hist. of the\r\nMerchant Adventurers, xxi.-xxv.] The sphere of trade of this body of\r\nexporting merchants extended along the coasts of France, the\r\nNetherlands, and Germany, opposite England, and some distance into the\r\ninterior. [Footnote: Ibid,, xxvi.] It is true that the Merchants\r\nAdventurers had many mediaeval features which assimilated them more to\r\nthe old merchant and craft guilds than to the more modern type of\r\nchartered commercial companies which were about to come into existence.\r\nThey had, like the craft guilds, a system of apprenticeship and\r\ndifferent degrees of advancement in their membership. [Footnote:\r\nLingelbach, Internal Organization of the Merchant Adventurers, 8-18.]\r\n\r\nThe members were all controlled by a \"stint,\" according to which an\r\napprentice in the last year of his term might ship one hundred pieces\r\nof cloth in the year; while a full freeman in the society could ship\r\nfrom four hundred to one thousand pieces a year, according to the\r\nlength of time he had been a member. [Footnote: Lingelbach, Laws and\r\nOrdinances of the Merchant Adventurers, 67-74.] They were under strict\r\nregulations against forestalling and undue competition. They could\r\ndisplay and sell their cloth only upon Mondays, Wednesdays, and\r\nFridays, and \"No person shall stand watchinge at the corners or ends of\r\nstreetes, or at other mens' Packhouses or at the house or place where\r\nanie clothe merchant or draper ys lodged, nor seeinge anie such in the\r\nstreet shall run or follow after hym with Intent to Entyce or lead hym\r\nto his packhouse, upon pain of fyve pounds ster.\" [Footnote:\r\nLingelbach, Laws and Ordinances of the Merchant Adventurers, 89, 91.]\r\n\r\nIn many respects, on the other hand, the Merchants Adventurers were\r\nquite similar to the later chartered companies, whose period of\r\nexistence their own overlapped. In fact, considering the early date of\r\ntheir origin, the tardy development of English economic life, and the\r\nobstacles to trading in a foreign country even so near as the\r\ncontinental seaboard, the conditions which confronted them were much\r\nthe same as those which the later companies had to meet, and they met\r\nthem in much the same way. They obtained a charter of incorporation\r\nfrom the king; they possessed a monopoly of trade in a certain\r\nterritory, as against other men of their own nation; they had a common\r\ntreasury for joint expenses; and they acted as, and were even called,\r\n\"the English nation,\" in the foreign country which was their abiding-\r\nplace. [Footnote: Lingelbach, Internal Organization, 29-34; Laws and\r\nOrdinances, passim; and Charters of 1462 and 1564.] The Merchants\r\nAdventurers, therefore, might be looked upon as a late surviving\r\nmediaeval merchant guild, modified in form by the necessity of adapting\r\nitself to trading in a foreign country; or it might be considered as\r\nthe earliest of the modern chartered commercial companies, still\r\nretaining in the seventeenth century some of its mediaeval features.\r\nViewed in either aspect, the Merchants Adventurers were a living model\r\nfor the organization of the new type of companies, and the powers and\r\nform of government of the latter show a similarity to the older company\r\nwhich is certainly not accidental.\r\n\r\nThe five or six English companies whose dates of foundation lie within\r\nthe sixteenth century all yield in importance, interest, and later\r\ninfluence to the East India Company, which was destined to an almost\r\nimperial existence of two centuries and a half, and which may well\r\nserve as the representative of the English chartered companies. Its\r\norigin was closely connected with the international relations of the\r\nlast decades of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe availability of the port of Lisbon as the western distributing\r\ncentre for Eastern goods ceased in 1580, when Portugal became a part of\r\nthe dominions of the king of Spain. As war already existed between\r\nSpain and the Netherlands, and was soon to break out between Spain and\r\nEngland, commerce was much disturbed; and after a few years of troubled\r\nintercourse that port was closed to the merchants of Holland and\r\nEngland. The union of the crowns of Spain and Portugal at this time had\r\nmuch the same effect on the supply of Eastern goods to these two\r\nProtestant seaboard states that the conquests of the Turks in the\r\neastern Mediterranean had had for the Italian cities a century before.\r\n\r\nIt was not likely that the two most vigorous, free, and commercially\r\nenterprising states of Europe would allow themselves long to be\r\nexcluded from the most attractive and lucrative trade in the world.\r\nAfter England, in her resistance to the Armada in 1588, applied the\r\ntouchstone to the naval prestige of Spain and showed its hollowness,\r\nher merchants and mariners took heart and pressed directly to the East.\r\nIn 1591 an English squadron of three ships, under Captains Raymond and\r\nLancaster, with the queen's leave, sailed down the western coast of\r\nAfrica, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, followed the east coast to\r\nZanzibar, and then passed across to Cape Comorin, Ceylon, and the Malay\r\npeninsula. They had mixed fortune, but one vessel returned home laden\r\nwith pepper, obtained for the most part from the hold of a Portuguese\r\nprize. In 1595 the first direct Dutch voyage was made along much the\r\nsame route. Other English and Dutch voyages followed; and in 1600 and\r\n1602, respectively the English and Dutch East India companies were\r\nchartered. The following analysis of the charter of the former of these\r\ncompanies will give the main characteristics of the new commercial\r\nsystem: [Footnote: Charters Granted to the East India Company, 3-26,]\r\n\r\n1. The charter, granted by Queen Elizabeth on December 31, 1600, was\r\naddressed by name to the earl of Cumberland and two hundred and fifteen\r\nknights and merchants, whom it created a corporation and a body politic\r\nunder the name of \"The Governor and Company of Merchants of London\r\nTrading to the East Indies.\"\r\n\r\n2. The territory to which they were given privileges of trade consisted\r\nof all continents and islands lying between the Cape of Good Hope and\r\nthe Straits of Magellan--that is to say, the east coast of Africa, the\r\nsouthern shore of Asia, the islands of the Indian Ocean, and the west\r\ncoast of America; so long as they made no attempt to trade with any\r\nport at the time of the charter in the possession of any prince in\r\nleague with Elizabeth, who should protest against such trade.\r\n\r\n3. The corporation was for all time; but the privileges of trade under\r\nthe charter were granted for fifteen years, with a promise, if they\r\nshould seem profitable to the crown and the realm, to extend them for\r\nfifteen years more; and with a reservation, on the other hard, of the\r\npower to terminate them on two years' notice.\r\n\r\n4. The powers of the company were those of an ordinary corporation and\r\nbody politic. The members of the company and their employees possessed\r\na complete monopoly of trade in the regions described, so far as\r\nEnglish subjects were concerned, having, moreover, the right to grant\r\nlicenses to non-members to trade within their limits.\r\n\r\n5. They could buy land without limitation in amount, and as a matter of\r\nfact the company gained its first foothold in each of its stations in\r\nthe East by buying a small piece of land from the native government.\r\n\r\n6. The company could send out yearly \"six good ships and six pinnaces\r\nwith five hundred mariners, unless the royal navy goes forth,\" and\r\nthese ships should not be seized even in times of special naval\r\nrestraint, unless the queen's need was extreme and was announced to the\r\ncompany three months before the ships were impressed.\r\n\r\n7. They had the right, in assemblies of the company held in any part of\r\nthe queen's dominions or outside of them, to make all reasonable laws\r\nfor their government not in opposition to the laws of England, and they\r\ncould punish by fine and imprisonment all offenders against these laws.\r\n8. Nothing is said in the original charter of the powers of offence and\r\ndefence, alliance and military organization; but these were probably\r\ntaken for granted, as they were so generally used by merchants and\r\nnavigators at the time, and were, as a matter of fact, exercised\r\nwithout limitation by the company from its first voyage.\r\n\r\n9. Especial privileges and exemptions were granted to the company by\r\nfreeing its members from the payment of customs for the first four\r\nvoyages, by giving them from six to twelve months' postponement of the\r\npayment of subsequent import duties, and by allowing them re-export of\r\nIndian goods free from customs duties. The laws against the export of\r\nbullion were also suspended in their favor to the extent of allowing\r\nthem to send out on each voyage 30,000 pounds in coin.\r\n\r\n10. The organization of this company was comparatively simple,\r\nconsisting of a governor, deputy governor, and twenty-four members of a\r\ndirecting board, \"to be called committees,\" [Footnote: The word\r\n\"committee\" at that time was used for a single person, as in the case\r\nof \"trustee,\" \"nominee,\" \"employee,\" and similar terms] all to be\r\nelected annually in a general assembly or court of the company. The\r\ngovernor and committees must all take the oath of allegiance to the\r\nEnglish sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe East India Company remained for some years a somewhat variable\r\nbody, as each voyage was made on the basis of a separate investment, by\r\ndifferent stockholders, and in varying amounts. But in 1609 the charter\r\nwas renewed, and in 1612 a longer joint-stock investment fixed the\r\nmembership more definitely. By this time the company had become, in\r\nfact, as permitted by its charter, a closely organized corporation,\r\nwith well-understood and clearly defined rights and powers, and it was\r\nsoon started on its career of trade, settlement, conquest, and\r\ndomination. [Footnote: Hunter, \"Hist of British India,\" I, 270-305.] A\r\nnew type of commercial organization had become clearly dominant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTYPICAL AMERICAN COLONIZING COMPANIES (1600-1628)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn exactly typical chartered commercial company, which combined all the\r\ncharacteristics of such companies, of course did not exist. The\r\ncountries with which they expected to trade ranged all the way from\r\nIndia to Canada; the political services which their governments imposed\r\nupon them varied from the production of tar, pitch, and turpentine to\r\nthe weakening of naval rivals; while the personal qualities of the\r\nfounders of the companies, and the sovereigns or ministers who gave the\r\ncharters differed widely. Moreover, the later development of many of\r\nthese companies had but little to do with the settlement of America.\r\nNevertheless, three companies may be chosen which exerted a deep\r\ninfluence on American colonization, and which, with the English East\r\nIndia Company described in the last chapter, are fairly typical of the\r\ngeneral system. These are the English Virginia Company, the Dutch West\r\nIndia Company, and the French Company of New France.\r\n\r\nThe charter of 1606 granted to the London and Plymouth companies was of\r\nan incomplete and transitional character; [Footnote: H. L. Osgood, \"The\r\nColonial Corporation\" (Political Science Quarterly, XL, 264-268). This\r\ncharter is printed in Stith, Hist, of Virginia, App. I.; in Brown,\r\nGenesis of the United States, and elsewhere.] the second Virginia\r\ncharter, [Footnote: Printed in full in Stith, Hist, of Virginia, App.\r\nII., and, with a few omissions, in Brown, Genesis of the United States,\r\nI., 208-237.] however, which was granted at the request of the company,\r\nMay 23, 1609, created a corporate trading and colonizing company\r\nclosely analogous to the East India Company, as will appear from the\r\nfollowing analysis: 1. The company was chartered under the name, \"The\r\nTreasurer and Company of Adventurers and Planters of the City of London\r\nfor the First Colony in Virginia.\" It was fully incorporated, with a\r\nseal and all legal corporate powers and liabilities. In the charter\r\nitself were named some twenty-one peers, ninety-six knights, eighty-six\r\nof the lesser gentry, a large number of citizens, merchants, sea-\r\ncaptains, and others, and fifty-six of the London companies--in all,\r\nseven hundred and fifteen persons and organizations. They included a\r\nlarge proportion of the enlightenment, enterprise, and wealth of the\r\ncapital, and, indeed, of all England. The grant was made to the company\r\nin perpetuity, although, as will be seen, some of its special\r\nexemptions and privileges were for a shorter term only.\r\n\r\n2. The region to which the grant applied was the territory stretching\r\nfour hundred miles along the coast, north and south from Chesapeake\r\nBay, and \"up into the land, from sea to sea westward and northward.\"\r\n\r\nThe possession of the soil was given to the company by the most\r\ncomplete title known to the English law, but with the requirement that\r\nit be distributed by the company to those who should have contributed\r\nmoney, services, or their presence to the colony.\r\n\r\n3. Its commercial powers extended to the exploitation of all the\r\nresources of the country, including mines, fisheries, and forests, as\r\nwell as agricultural products; and to the requirement that all\r\nEnglishmen not members of the company should pay a subsidy of five per\r\ncent, of the value of all goods brought into or taken out of the\r\ncompany's territory, and all foreigners ten per cent, of the value of\r\nthe goojis. The company might send to Virginia all shipping, weapons,\r\nvictuals, articles of trade, and other equipment that might be\r\nnecessary, and also all such colonists as should be willing to go.\r\n\r\n4. Powers of government in its territory were granted to the company\r\nwith considerable completeness, the charter declaring that it might\r\nmake all orders, laws, directions, and other provisions fit and\r\nnecessary for the government of the colony, and that the governor and\r\nother officers might, \"within the said precincts of Virginia or in the\r\nway by sea thither and from thence, have full and absolute power and\r\nauthority to correct, punish, pardon, govern, and rule\" all the\r\ninhabitants of the colony, in accordance with its laws already made.\r\n\r\nAs to offensive and defensive powers, it had the right to repel or\r\nexpel by military force all persons attempting to force their way into\r\nits territories and all persons attempting any hurt or annoyance to the\r\ncolony. The governor might exercise martial law in the colony, and was\r\nprovided with the general military powers of a lord-lieutenant of one\r\nof the English counties. Thus the company and its colony were organized\r\nnot exactly as an imperium in imperio, but at least as an outlying\r\nimperium.\r\n\r\n5. As for special subsidies and privileges, the government of King\r\nJames was scarcely in a position to make money contributions for such\r\nan enterprise, or to give to it ships such as the continental\r\ngovernments might give to their companies; but for seven years the\r\ncompany was allowed to take out all that was necessary for the support,\r\nequipment, and defence of its colonists, and for trade with the\r\nnatives, free of all tax or duty; and for twenty years it should be\r\nfree from customs on goods imported into Virginia, and should forever\r\npay only five per cent import duty on goods brought from Virginia to\r\nEngland. Among privileges of less material value, but long after\r\nremembered for other reasons, the charter promised to the company that\r\nall the king's subjects whom it should take to inhabit the colony, with\r\ntheir children and their posterity, should have and enjoy all\r\nliberties, franchises, and immunities of free-born Englishmen and\r\nnatural subjects of the king just as if they had remained or been born\r\nin England itself.\r\n\r\n6. The duties to be performed by the company as respects the government\r\nwere very few. In recognition of the socage tenure on which the land\r\nwas held, a payment of one-tenth of all gold and silver was required;\r\nand the members of the council of the company were required to take an\r\noath of allegiance to the king in the name of the company. The main\r\nrequirement from the company was colonization. It was fully\r\nanticipated, and in the preamble expressed, that the process of taking\r\nout settlers should be a continuous one; and a failure to transport\r\ncolonists by the company's efforts would certainly have been a failure\r\nto fulfil the conditions of its charter.\r\n\r\n7. Although there was no requirement of absolute conformity with the\r\nestablished church of England, yet on the ground of the desire to carry\r\nonly true religion to the natives it was made the duty of the officials\r\nof the company to tender the oath of supremacy to every prospective\r\ncolonist before he sailed, and thus to insure the Protestantism of the\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\n8. The form of government of the company in England received much\r\nattention in the charter, as well it might, after the failure of the\r\narrangements of the former charter. The membership, quarterly\r\nassemblies of the general body of the members, more frequent meetings\r\nof a governing council of fifty-three officers, and their duties, were\r\nall minutely formulated; and the supremacy of this council, so\r\nconsonant with the ideas of King James, and so opposed to the needs and\r\nthe tendencies of the times, was carefully but, as it proved,\r\nunsuccessfully provided for. [Footnote: Osgood, \"The Colonial\r\nCorporation\" (Political Science Quarterly, XI., 369-273).] The charter\r\nof the Dutch West India Company was granted by \"The High and Mighty\r\nLords, the Lords States-General of the United Netherlands,\" June 3,\r\n1621. It had already been under discussion in the various\r\nrepresentative bodies of the Netherlands for fifteen years, and had\r\nbeen a fixed idea in the brain of its projector, William Usselinx, for\r\nat least fourteen years before that, [Footnote: Jameson, Usselinx, 21,\r\n28, 70.] advocated in a dozen pamphlets and a hundred memorials and\r\ncommunications, written and oral, to the States-General; and it had the\r\nadvantage of the state's experience with the Dutch East India Company.\r\nThe shape given to the West India Company in its charter was not,\r\ntherefore, merely an outcome of the plans of an individual, but a\r\nresultant also of the influence of the earlier commercial companies, of\r\nthe political conditions of the time, and of the ambitions, economic\r\nand political, of the influential merchant-rulers of the Netherlands.\r\n[Footnote: Ibid, 2-4.]\r\n\r\n1. The company was given for twenty-four years, during which no\r\nstockholders could withdraw and no new subscriptions would be received,\r\nthe monopoly of the Dutch trade on the west coast of Africa, from Cape\r\nVerd to the Cape of Good Hope; in all the islands lying in the Atlantic\r\nOcean; on the east coast of America from Newfoundland to the Straits of\r\nMagellan; and even beyond the straits on its west coast, and in the\r\nsouthern lands which at that time were still believed to stretch from\r\nCape Horn across the South Pacific to New Guinea. All the non-European\r\nregions of the globe were thus divided by the States-General, with even\r\ngreater boldness than by Pope Alexander, between the East and West\r\nIndia Dutch chartered companies.\r\n\r\n2. Its commercial privileges included a general monopoly and extended\r\nto all forms of advancement of trade.\r\n\r\n3. As to colonization, the charter provided that the company \"may\r\nadvance the peopling of fruitful and unsettled parts.\" Usselinx, the\r\noriginal author and the persistent advocate of the plan, would gladly\r\nhave made more adequate provision for the establishment of colonies,\r\nthe stimulation of agriculture and mining, good government in these\r\ncolonies, their religious life, and the conversion of the natives. He\r\nhad a picture in his mind of a great commercial dominion, settled from\r\nHolland and other countries, forming a market for European\r\nmanufactures, and producing colonial goods for the use of the\r\nNetherlands. [Footnote: Jameson, Usselinx, 43.] But the charter was\r\ngranted in war time, and by a body of aristocratic traders, who, as\r\nBacon says, \"look ever to the present gain\"; so that the capture of\r\nSpanish plate-fleets and the sacking of West Indian settlements are\r\ncontemplated with as much assurance and interest as are colonization\r\nand more legitimate commerce.\r\n\r\n4. In view of later disputes between England and her colonies, it is\r\nworthy of note that even such an enlightened advocate of a prosperous,\r\nself-governing colonial empire as Usselinx should have insisted, in\r\n1618, that the colonists were to pay taxes to the home government, to\r\ntrade with the Netherlands only, and to have no manufactures that would\r\ncompete with those of the mother-country. [Footnote: Ibid., 63]\r\n\r\n5. The political or semi-public powers of the company, according to the\r\ncharter, were very extensive: it could form alliances and make war, so\r\nlong as the war was defensive or retaliatory, could build forts,\r\nmaintain troops, appoint officers, capture prizes, and arrest offenders\r\non the high seas.\r\n\r\n6. By way of subsidy the company was given one million florins, the use\r\nof sixteen government ships and four yachts, and exemption from all\r\ntolls and license dues on its ships.\r\n\r\n7. The duties required of the company were an oath of fidelity to\r\nPrince Maurice, the stadtholder, and to the States-General, on the part\r\nof its officers; the provision of a number of vessels equal at least to\r\nthose provided by the government; the return of its ships whenever\r\npracticable to the ports from which they had set out; the preservation\r\nfor military purposes of all prizes captured from enemies of the\r\nStates-General; the periodical publishing of accounts; and the\r\ndivision, after six years, of all surplus over ten per cent, in such a\r\nway that, in addition to what the shareholders received, one-tenth\r\nshould go to the States-General and one-thirtieth to Count Maurice.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Dutch West India Company was very complicated,\r\nreflecting the political arrangements of the Netherlands and the\r\njealousies of a merchant aristocracy distributed in provinces and\r\ncities. There was a governor-in-chief of the company's colonial\r\npossessions, but his powers were dependent on a general board of\r\nnineteen directors, who were the supreme authority in the regulation of\r\nthe company's affairs. Below this central body were five territorial\r\nchambers, with a combined membership of seventy-eight. The numbers,\r\npowers, and influence on the policy of the company of these chambers\r\nwere in proportion to the wealth of the cities they represented and to\r\nthe amount of the stock subscribed from these cities. The Amsterdam\r\nchamber, which was to subscribe one-half the capital stock, was far the\r\nmost influential and had the largest number of directors; after it in\r\norder came the chambers of Zealand, of the cities on the Meuse, of the\r\ncities of North Holland, and of the cities of Friesland and Groningen.\r\nThese local boards elected the general board, one-third of their\r\nnumber, chosen by lot, retiring each year. [Footnote: Jameson,\r\nUsselinx, 33, 34.]\r\n\r\nWhen Richelieu became prime-minister of France in 1624, one of the\r\nearliest definite lines of policy he initiated was the formation of\r\nprivileged commercial companies. [Footnote: Edict of Reformation of\r\n1627, art. 429; Isambert, Recueil General des Anciennes Lois\r\nFrancaises, XVI., 329.] He saw with great clearness and formulated in a\r\nstate paper [Footnote: Michaud et Poujoulat, Memoires, I., chap,\r\nxviii., 438.] the reasons for recognizing the superiority for distant\r\ncommerce, under the conditions of that period, of chartered companies\r\nover individual traders. He was also much impressed with the power and\r\nsuccess of the great East India companies of England and Holland. His\r\nfirst plan was a general French company of commerce, to include all the\r\noutlying sections of the world, and at least two such companies were\r\nchartered in succession. They came to nothing, and soon gave place to\r\ncompanies authorized each to carry on commerce with a specified part of\r\nAmerica, Africa, Europe, or Asia.[Footnote: Pigeonneau, Hist. du\r\nCommerce, II., 426-431.] The most important of these was the company of\r\nCanada, chartered in 1628 on the plans of Champlain, and intended to\r\ntake the place of all earlier companies and individual grantees having\r\nprivileges in that region. The chartered powers and privileges of this\r\ncompany may be analyzed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The region to which they extended was \"the fort and settlement of\r\nQuebec, with all the country of New France, called Canada.\" [Footnote:\r\nIsambert, Recueil General, XVI., 216-222.] It was described as\r\nextending along the Atlantic coast from Florida to the arctic circle,\r\nand from Newfoundland westward to the sources of the farthest rivers\r\nwhich fell into the St. Lawrence or the \"Fresh Sea.\"\r\n\r\n2. The power of the company over the soil was complete. It was allowed\r\nto sell or dispose of it in such portions and on such terms as it\r\nshould see fit, except that if it should grant great fiefs such as\r\nduchies or baronies, letters of confirmation to the grantees should be\r\nsought from the crown.\r\n\r\n3. The continuance of the company in its full form with all powers and\r\nduties was to be for fifteen years, while for other purposes its life\r\nwas to be perpetual.\r\n\r\n4. Its commercial privileges extended during this term of fifteen years\r\nto the complete monopoly of all kinds of commerce by sea or land, all\r\nformer grants being withdrawn; and the company was empowered to\r\nconfiscate any French or other vessels coming to trade within its\r\ndominions. The value of Canada as a source of supply for furs was\r\nalready known, and the fur trade was placed under the special control\r\nof the company forever. The whale and seal fisheries, on the other\r\nhand, were exempted from its control, even for the fifteen years, and\r\nleft free to all Frenchmen.\r\n\r\n5. As a form of subsidy the king agreed to give the company two war-\r\nvessels of two hundred to three hundred tons, armed and equipped for a\r\nvoyage; but they were to be victualled, supported, and, in case of\r\nloss, replaced by the company. He also presented them with certain\r\ncannon formerly the property of the East India Company. The nature of\r\nthese gifts seems to intimate the possibility of warlike expeditions of\r\nthe company against the king's enemies and its own, and prizes are\r\nreferred to repeatedly as a possible source of income.\r\n\r\n6. All goods of all kinds brought from New France were to be exempted\r\nfor fifteen years from all duties and imposts; and all victuals,\r\nmunitions of war, and all other necessaries exported from France to the\r\ncolony should be likewise exempt. Other privileges were permission to\r\nnobles, clergymen, and officers to join the company without derogation\r\nfrom their rank, and an agreement to ennoble twelve prominent members\r\nof the company; full naturalization as French citizens of all colonists\r\nand converted natives; and the advancement of all artisans who should\r\npursue their trades in the colony for six years, to full mastership in\r\ntheir respective occupations.\r\n\r\n7. The duties the company was bound to fulfil in return for these\r\nconcessions were primarily those of colonization. The company engaged\r\nto take over to New France two or three hundred colonists of both sexes\r\nwithin the year 1628, and altogether four thousand within fifteen\r\nyears; to lodge, feed, and provide them with the necessaries of life\r\nfor three years after their emigration; and then to assign to them\r\nenough cleared land for their support and enough grain to sow it and to\r\nfeed them till the first harvest. These provisions showed a clear\r\ninsight into the difficulties of settlement of a new country, but they\r\nalso imposed upon the company a crushing burden of expense which\r\nrequired true Gallic optimism to contemplate with any assurance of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n8. Next to peopling of the colony came the conversion of the heathen.\r\nIndeed, this object, with proper piety, was placed in the forefront of\r\nthe edict creating the company. In each settlement the company was\r\nbound to provide at least three priests and give them support for\r\nfifteen years, or else provide them with cleared land sufficient for\r\ntheir support. After the expiration of the fifteen years, and for\r\nfurther missionary efforts, the religious needs of the colony were\r\ncommended to the charity and devotion of the company and the colonists.\r\n\r\n9. It was required that all colonists should be natural-born Frenchmen\r\nand Catholics. The absolute orthodoxy of this colony from its inception\r\nwas in striking contrast with the freedom from religious restriction of\r\nthe colonies planned by Coligny before the civil wars had forced the\r\ngovernment to introduce rigorous conformity.\r\n\r\n10. The company's rights over the colony were great: they could appoint\r\nofficers of sovereign justice, who should be commissioned by the crown;\r\nand nominate military officials by sea and land over ships, troops, and\r\nfortresses, the king agreeing to appoint their nominees. They were\r\nempowered to build forts, forge cannon, make gunpowder, and do all\r\nthings necessary for the security of the colony and its commerce.\r\n\r\n11. The charter contained no provisions for the internal government of\r\nthe company, simply recognizing the existing voluntary organization of\r\none hundred associates, whom it describes as a \"strong company for the\r\nestablishment of a colony of native Frenchmen.\" As far as membership\r\nextends, they were allowed to join to themselves any additional number\r\nup to another hundred.\r\n\r\nThus was organized the company which, through the genius of Champlain\r\nand with much tribulation, laid the foundations of the colony of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nConsidering as types these four companies dating from 1600, 1609, 1621,\r\nand 1628, and representing England, Holland, and France, a comparison\r\nof their main characteristics leads to the following generalizations:\r\n\r\n1. It is evident that there was in early modern times a movement for\r\nthe organization and chartering of companies for distant commerce,\r\nclosely dependent on their respective governments. These companies had\r\ntheir period of rise in the sixteenth century; a rapid and wide-spread\r\ndevelopment in the seventeenth; and a subsequent decline and discredit\r\nin the eighteenth. The movement was European; every country whose\r\nsituation or ambitions would at all admit of distant trading, and whose\r\nsystem of commerce was not, like that of Spain and Portugal, already\r\nstereotyped under government control, adopted approximately the same\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n2. To each of these companies was secured by its charter the monopoly\r\nof trade in a particular region. Its members alone had power or right\r\nto carry on commerce with a specified people, over a specified extent\r\nof coasts or lands, and during a definite period of years. This\r\nmonopoly might be only as against the fellow-countrymen of the members\r\nof the company; but an effort, generally successful, was made to\r\nexclude all other Europeans from each reserved field of commerce.\r\n\r\n3. The companies were based on unions of the capital of many merchants\r\nor other adventurers. An official Dutch letter on the trade with\r\nAmerica speaks of \"knowing by experience that without the common\r\nassistance of a general company navigation and commerce could not be\r\npractised, maintained, and defended in the regions and quarters\r\ndesignated above, because of the great risks from corsairs, pirates,\r\nand other extortions which are met with upon such voyages.\" [Footnote:\r\nLetters to the Dutch West India Company, June 9, 1621.] The preliminary\r\nequipment of ships, the purchase of supplies and merchandise, the\r\nacquisition of land, the building of forts and the supply of weapons\r\nand military material; the payment of a military force to protect their\r\ncommerce against natives or interloping Europeans; the expenses, in\r\nmany cases, of transporting and supporting colonists; and, finally, the\r\nlong waiting before returns could be reasonably hoped for--some or all\r\nof these expenses were inseparable from the whole plan of establishing\r\ndistant trade. It was no wonder that individual traders gave place to\r\ngreat unions of the merchants of London, Amsterdam, or Dieppe, who\r\nrisked part of their means and united their resources to form companies\r\nto trade with the East and West Indies, Africa, and other outlying\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\n4. Neither the possession of a monopoly nor the creation of a large,\r\njoint capital was considered enough to launch an enterprise of this\r\nkind. The grant of public or political powers by government was\r\nnecessary to make its economic objects attainable, and these were given\r\nwith a free hand. The companies very generally received, explicitly or\r\nby implication, rights of peace and war, of supreme justice, of\r\nadministrative independence, and of legislation for their own\r\nterritory, members, and servants. A chartered company was in many cases\r\nthe holder from the crown of a wide fief in which it possessed more\r\nthan feudal powers. As a matter of fact, the companies generally\r\nremained quite dependent on the home authorities, but this resulted\r\nfrom the desire to save expense, from the supremacy of commercial\r\nideals, or from patriotism, rather than from deficiencies in their\r\ncharters.\r\n\r\n5. In the grant of these extensive political powers the home\r\ngovernments had ulterior motives. The seventeenth century was a period\r\nof intense international rivalry, and the chartered commercial\r\ncompanies were pieces in the game. It was not mere profit in pounds,\r\nshillings, and pence which Elizabeth hoped to obtain from the voyages\r\nof the ships of the East India Company, but a weakening of the power\r\nand wealth and colonial dominion of Spain. Even in the more peaceful\r\ntimes of James, the Spaniards saw, and were justified in seeing, in the\r\npopular interest in Virginia another phase of the national hatred of\r\nSpain. [Footnote: Letters from Zuniga to Philip III, in Brown, Genesis\r\nof the United States, docs, xxviii.-xxxiii., etc.] It was at the close\r\nof the twelve years' truce between the Netherlands and Spain, just when\r\nthe war was being resumed, that the Dutch West India Company was\r\nformed, and its greatest activity was in a warlike rivalry with its\r\ngreat opponent in South America. \"The reputation of this crown\" was\r\ncombined with \"the glory of God\" in the charter of the Canada Company;\r\nand most of the commercial and colonizing projects of France in the\r\nseventeenth as in the nineteenth century, had a large element of\r\npolitical pride behind them. Sometimes it was warlike conquest,\r\nsometimes the expulsion of a rival, sometimes the acquisition of a new\r\nbase of operations, sometimes the obtaining of a more favorable balance\r\nof trade, sometimes mere international rivalry; but whatever the other\r\nelements, there were always some political objects in addition to the\r\nhope of obtaining dividends from trade.\r\n\r\n6. For the history of America, the most important characteristic common\r\nto the chartered companies of the seventeenth century is the\r\nterritorial foothold they obtained in the regions where they possessed\r\ntheir monopolies. It might be only a few acres of ground used for a\r\nfort, storehouses, and dwellings, which was all the English East India\r\nCompany possessed for the first century and a half of its existence; or\r\nit might be the almost limitless domains of the Canada or Virginia\r\nCompany. There was no distinction between two kinds of companies, one\r\nfor commerce, the other for colonization, but simply one of relative\r\nattention given to the two interests, according to the character of the\r\nregions for which the companies had obtained their concessions. All the\r\ncompanies expected to carry on commerce; all expected to plant some of\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen on the soil of the country with which they\r\nmeant to trade. If the region of their activity was the ancient,\r\nwealthy, thickly settled, and firmly governed coast of India, the\r\nsettlers were only a few servants of the company. If, on the other\r\nhand, the region for which the monopoly of the company was granted was\r\na broad and temperate tract, occupied by a sparse population of\r\nsavages, and offering only such objects of trade or profit as could be\r\ncollected slowly or wrested by European labor from, the soil or the\r\nforest, the quickest way to a commercial profit was the establishment\r\non the distant soil of a large body of colonists from the home land.\r\n\r\nThis necessity for colonization in order to carry out their other\r\nobjects makes the chartered commercial companies of the seventeenth\r\ncentury fundamental factors in American history. The proprietary\r\ncompanies of Virginia, Massachusetts, New Netherland, Canada, and other\r\ncolonies were primarily commercial bodies seeking dividends, and only\r\nsecondarily colonization societies sending over settlers. This\r\ndistinction, and the gradual pre-dominance of the latter over the\r\nformer, is the clew to much of the early history of settlement in\r\nAmerica. The commercial object could only be carried out by employing\r\nthe plan of colonization, but new motives were soon added. The\r\npatriotic and religious conditions of the times created an interest in\r\nthe American settlements as places where men could begin life, anew\r\nwith new possibilities. Hence the company, the home government,\r\ndissatisfied religious bodies, and many individuals, looked to the\r\nsettlements in America with other than a commercial interest. The\r\npolicy of the companies was modified and eventually transformed by the\r\ninfluence of these non-commercial interests.\r\n\r\nAs financial enterprises, the chartered commercial companies were\r\nsubject to such great practical difficulties that few of them survived\r\nfor any great length of time or repaid their original investment to the\r\nshareholders. Some were reorganized time and again, each time on a more\r\nextensive scale, and each time to suffer heavier losses. [Footnote: W.\r\nR. Scott, \"The Royal African Company\" (Am. Hist. Review, VIII., 2).]\r\nThey experienced much mismanagement and softie peculation and fraud on\r\nthe part of their directors; in some cases false dividends were\r\ndeclared for the purpose of temporarily raising the value of the stock.\r\nTheir credit was bad, and they sometimes had to borrow money at fifty\r\nand even seventy-five per cent, interest. [Footnote: Bonnassieux, Les\r\nGrandes Compagnies de Commerce, 494, etc.]\r\n\r\nThey encountered other difficulties quite apart from the incompetency\r\nor dishonesty of their directors. Parliaments and States-General were\r\nopposed to monopolistic and privileged companies, and threw what\r\nobstacles they could in their way; and political exigencies often\r\nforced even the sovereigns who had given them their charters to disavow\r\nand discourage them. [Footnote: Letter of October 8, 1607, from Zufiiga\r\nto the king of Spain, in Brown, Genesis of the United States, I., 121.]\r\nTheir greatest difficulties, how-ever, arose from the very nature of\r\nthe problem which they were trying to solve. Distant commerce with\r\nbarbarous races, amid jealous rivals, carried on with insufficient\r\ncapital; the persuasion of reluctant emigrants to establish themselves\r\nin the wilderness at a time when the mother-country was not yet\r\novercrowded; the long waiting for returns and the failure of one dream\r\nafter another--it was these difficulties in the very work itself that\r\nled to the failure of most of the companies and the scanty success of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the companies played a very important part in the\r\nadvancement of civilization during the period of their existence. They\r\nenriched Europe with many products of the New World and the more\r\ndistant Old World, which could hardly have reached it, or reached it in\r\nsuch abundance, except for the organized voyages of the chartered\r\ncompanies. The formation of chartered companies relieved certain\r\nnations of their dependence upon other nations for some of the\r\nnecessities and many of the luxuries of life. National independence was\r\nfurthered, at the same time that foreign products were made much\r\ncheaper. Spices, sugar, coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, cotton, silk,\r\ndrugs, and other articles were made accessible to all. New shipping was\r\nbuilt by the companies and additional commercial intercourse created.\r\n[Footnote: Bonnassieux, Les Grandes Compagnies de Commerce, 514.] New\r\nterritories were made valuable and new centres of activity created in\r\nold and stagnant as well as in new and undeveloped countries. Above\r\nall, the chartered companies were the actual instruments by which many\r\ncolonies were founded, and a strong impress given to the institutions\r\nof these colonies through all their later history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PROTESTANT REFORMATION ON THE CONTINENT\r\n\r\n(1500-1625)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn analyzing the forces which affected the colonization of America, the\r\ndepth of the impression made upon Europe by the Protestant Reformation\r\ncan hardly be overestimated. Although the direct and immediate\r\ninfluence of this great movement upon the fortunes of America was\r\ngreat, its indirect and remote effects have been still more important.\r\nOne of these effects was the creation of a religious motive for\r\nemigration which, in conjunction with other incentives, was one of the\r\nearliest and most constant causes for the peopling of America.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the desire for religious freedom was only one among\r\nmany such impelling forces. The desire to better their fortunes was\r\nperhaps the most fundamental and enduring consideration that influenced\r\nemigrants. Many settlers came because at home they had failed or were\r\nburdened with debt, or had become involved in ill repute or crime, and\r\nhoped to make a new start in a new land. Many sought the New World as\r\nmany still press to the frontier, from sheer restlessness and\r\nrecklessness, from the love of adventure, the hope that luck will do\r\nbetter for them than labor. Many came as a result of urgent inducements\r\noffered by projectors of colonies or agents of shipmasters, as in the\r\ncase of the early \"company servants\" or the later \"redemptioners\" or\r\n\"indentured servants.\"\r\n\r\nNo inconsiderable number came because they were forced to come: the\r\nearlier planters of colonies and patentees of lands received permission\r\nto seize for their uses men and women of the lower classes, much as men\r\nwere pressed into naval service; paupers were handed over to the\r\ncolonizing companies to be shipped to their settlements; repeatedly the\r\nprisons were emptied to provide colonists, and commissions were\r\nappointed, as in England in 1633, \"to reprieve able-bodied persons\r\nconvicted of certain felonies, and to bestow them to be used in\r\ndiscoveries and other foreign employments.\" [Footnote: Cal. of State\r\nPap, Domestic, 1631-1633, p. 547.]\r\n\r\nSomewhat later, transportation to the colonies to labor for a fixed\r\nnumber of years became a familiar form of commutation of the death\r\npenalty, and after 1662 it was made the statutory penalty for certain\r\noffences.\r\n\r\nYet among this multiplicity of motives for emigration to the colonies\r\nreligion held a peculiar place. Many men for whom the dominant\r\ninducement was a more material one were partly led by religious\r\nmotives; many of the changes in Europe that unsettled men and made them\r\nmore ready to leave their old homes were results of the Reformation.\r\nReligious motives were the earliest to send any really large body of\r\nsettlers to the English colonies, and they remained for more than a\r\ncentury probably the most effective motives.\r\n\r\nDuring the first twenty years of the settlement of Virginia, where the\r\nreligious incentive was least strong, less than six thousand settlers\r\ncame over; during the first twenty years of the settlement of New\r\nEngland, where it was strongest, there were more than twenty thousand.\r\nThe later churchmen of Virginia and the Carolinas, the Catholics of\r\nMaryland, the Quakers of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and a great body\r\nof Presbyterians, Huguenots, Mennonites, Moravians, and adherents of\r\nother sects which were products of the Reformation, sought tinder the\r\nmore liberal laws of the colonies the religious liberty which they\r\ncould not find at home.\r\n\r\nThe working of this influence in England will appear in a later chapter\r\non the religious history of that country during this period; its\r\npeculiar development in Germany seems to demand a further word of\r\nexplanation here. Three forms of reformed doctrine and organization--\r\nLutheranism, Calvinism, and Zwinglianism--grew up on German soil in the\r\nyears between 1517 and 1555, and obtained more or less extensive\r\nrecognition and power from imperial, princely, or city authorities.\r\nLutheranism, the most moderate and widely accepted form of\r\nProtestantism, was officially established in most of the central and\r\nnorthern and in some of the southern states and cities; Calvinism, less\r\nwidely extended but more strictly organized, held a similar position in\r\nthe southwest; while the doctrines of Zwingli, which had been adopted\r\nand were enforced in the greater part of Switzerland, spread to a\r\nnumber of those southern regions of Germany from which Switzerland was\r\nas yet indistinctly separated. [Footnote: Armstrong, The Emperor\r\nCharles V., I., 228-231.]\r\n\r\nA vast number of earnest souls were not satisfied with any of these\r\nforms of official religion, and even in the earliest days of the\r\nReformation, preachers arose who went beyond the moderate reforms of\r\nLuther, Zwingli, or Calvin, and whose teachings gained a ready\r\nacceptance. In Saxony, in Hesse, in South Germany, and in Moravia; in\r\nthe cities of Constance, Strasburg, Augsburg, and Nuremberg; in the\r\nNetherlands and in Switzerland, there was much preaching and formation\r\nof independent religious communities quite apart from, and indeed in\r\nopposition to, the official Reformation. [Footnote: Moeller, Hist, of\r\nthe Christian Church (English trans.), III., 36, 64, 88, 94.] These\r\nradical preachers and their followers represented very different\r\nbeliefs and practices. That which was common to them all was an\r\nacceptance of the Bible literally interpreted as a guide both to\r\ndoctrine and to church organization. The effort to return to the\r\napostolic organization of the church led them to reject any but an\r\nunpaid ministry, and to insist that none should be members of their\r\ncongregations except such as were personally converted and who\r\nconformed their lives to the teachings of the Bible.\r\n\r\nTheir idea was, therefore, the formation of little companies separated\r\nfrom the surrounding people of the world rather than the Lutheran or\r\nZwinglian plan of a reorganization of the national church on Protestant\r\nlines en masse. An austere piety, the wearing of plain clothes, the\r\navoidance of forms of social respect, the refusal to take an oath or to\r\nhold civil office, an assertion of the sinfulness of paying or\r\nreceiving tithes or interest, an approach to communistic practice in\r\nmatters of property--some or all of these were widely disseminated\r\namong the lower classes of the people to whom such teachings\r\nprincipally appealed.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine which came nearest to being a point of uniformity and a\r\npossible bond of union among these reformers was their objection to\r\ninfant baptism. To them baptism was the mark of a personally attained\r\nrelation to Christ, and was, therefore, meaningless when administered\r\nto an unconscious infant. Certain \"prophets\" who came to Wittenberg\r\nfrom Zwickau confronted Luther and Melancthon with this principle as\r\nearly as 1521; and radical reformers proclaimed it in opposition to\r\nZwingli at Zurich in 1523. Everywhere advocacy of an exact adherence to\r\nthe verbal teaching of Holy Writ and a rejection of the claims of an\r\nestablished church, were accompanied by opposition to infant baptism.\r\nIn 1525 for the first time the logical deduction from their premises\r\nwas made; those baptized only in their infancy were asserted not to\r\nhave been effectively baptized at all, and were rebaptized as a sign of\r\ntheir conversion. [Footnote: Moeller, Hist, of the Christian Church\r\n(English trans.), III., 65.] From this time onward re-baptism, or, from\r\nthe point of view of its advocates, the first valid baptism, became the\r\ntest and mark of adoption into many communities of true believers.\r\nThose who practised this rite were, therefore, called \"Anabaptists\"--\r\nthat is to say, those who baptized a second time--or, more frequently,\r\nmerely \"Baptists.\"\r\n\r\nThe rebaptism of a person who had been already once baptized was not\r\nonly in the eyes of the established church an impiety, it was in the\r\neyes of the established law a capital crime, and the history of\r\nAnabaptism in Germany is the history of a long martyrdom. In Catholic\r\nand Protestant countries alike these radicals were persecuted. From\r\nStrasburg and Nuremberg they were expelled, in Zurich their leaders\r\nwere drowned, in Augsburg they were beheaded, in Austria, Wittenberg,\r\nBavaria, and the Palatinate they were burned at the stake.\r\n\r\nIn 1534 their sect was brought into sudden and fatal prominence by the\r\nrevolt in Munster and its vicinity. Here a body of adherents of radical\r\nreligious doctrines added to their creed a tenet not common to the\r\ngeneral body of Anabaptists--that is to say, the duty of taking up\r\ntemporal arms to overthrow the existing powers and to introduce the New\r\nJerusalem. The old episcopal city was seized by the Anabaptist leaders,\r\nbloody battles were fought, and after a six months' orgy of fanaticism,\r\nlibertinism, and violence the rebels were defeated by the united troops\r\nof Catholic and Lutheran powers and a terrible vengeance taken.\r\n\r\nAnabaptists everywhere, no matter how peaceable and moderate their\r\nprinciples, suffered under the imputation of holding such doctrines as\r\nhad led to the terrible excesses at Munster, as they had long before\r\nbeen held to sympathize with the Peasants' Revolt; and their\r\npersecutions became correspondingly harsher. Nevertheless, they\r\ncontinued to form communities and to spread through Germany, the\r\nNetherlands, and Switzerland. The attractiveness of the teachings of\r\nwandering Anabaptist preachers long continued unabated, and their\r\nregularly organized congregations or communities, because of their\r\nthrift, honesty, and plainness of life, survived and flourished,\r\nwherever they could obtain even the barest and most temporary\r\ntoleration.\r\n\r\nThey were necessarily a people without a national home. Seldom for a\r\nwhole generation did any considerable body of Anabaptists or Pietists\r\nremain undisturbed in any one locality. Expelled by imperial edict from\r\nBohemia, they made their way to Hungary and Transylvania; fined,\r\nimprisoned, and in danger of death in Protestant Switzerland, they\r\nmigrated to the Tyrol, to the Palatinate, and to the south German\r\ncities, only soon to be visited there with still worse persecution.\r\nDuring the two great religious wars they suffered especial hardships,\r\nand in the midst of the Thirty Years' War they were rigorously expelled\r\nby the emperor from all his hereditary dominions, even from Moravia,\r\nwhere they had been allowed to exist for almost a century. [Footnote:\r\nMoeller, Hist. of the Christian Church (English trans.), III., 437-\r\n442.] Either from original differences of doctrine and personal\r\ninfluence, or from later divisions and reorganization, grew up those\r\nbodies which, although often, as has been seen, grouped under the\r\ngeneral head of Anabaptists, have become known in Europe and America as\r\nMennonites, Amish, and Dunkers; and each of these bodies has\r\nexperienced various divisions. The Schwenkfelders, Boehmists, and other\r\nmystics or pietists, are habitually grouped with these sects, rather\r\nbecause of their similar historical origin and attitude to the\r\nestablished churches than of any identity of religious belief.\r\n\r\nBy the close of the seventeenth century the condition of these\r\ndissenters from the established churches had become more tolerable; but\r\nthey were at best a remnant, narrowed in spirit by persecution,\r\nrepeatedly separated from their earlier homes, still under the ban of\r\necclesiastical disapproval, and even where tolerated living under\r\nburdensome restrictions. The rising colonies of the New World,\r\nespecially those which promised religious liberty, and above all that\r\none of them whose Quaker founder held doctrines so like their own, must\r\nhave exerted, notwithstanding their alien race and tongue, an almost\r\nirresistible attraction upon them. In view of the political and\r\nreligious history of Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies, it is therefore no wonder that a vast number of Germans\r\nemigrated to America, and that in Pennsylvania were soon to be found\r\nnumerous representatives of every religious sect that existed in the\r\nfatherland.\r\n\r\nThe religious divisions which sprang from the Protestant Reformation\r\nwere not restricted to the Old World. In America, also, religion was a\r\ncentrifugal influence, splitting up old colonies, and establishing new\r\ncentres of population, which in turn attracted other groups of\r\nemigrants from Europe, and brought into existence still other types of\r\ngovernment and society. [Footnote: Eggleston, Beginners of a Nation,\r\n266-346.] The results were shown in the characteristics of Rhode Island\r\nand Connecticut, of Germantown and Bethlehem, in some of the principal\r\ncontrasts between New France and New England, and in many of the lesser\r\ndiversities that have distinguished different sections of America in\r\ntheir subsequent history. Many influences combined to give form and\r\ncharacter to each American settlement: its race elements, the\r\ncommercial requirements of the controlling chartered company, the\r\ndemands of the home government, the theoretical ideas of the founder,\r\nthe habitudes of the colonists in the lands from which they came. Among\r\nthese influences, as among the motives for emigration, the religious\r\nexperiences and desires of the settlers were a prime factor.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation indirectly affected America by wars which soon led to\r\nthe rise of some nations, the fall of others; they pitted Catholic\r\nstates against Protestant states, they weakened Germany, France, and\r\nthe southern Netherlands by a sanguinary civil struggle, and were\r\navoided in England only by harsh persecution.\r\n\r\nIn the Iberian peninsula the progress of Protestantism was so slight\r\nand so quickly crushed out that it played no part in the colonization\r\nof Portuguese or Spanish America. It is true that the somewhat outworn\r\nmachinery of the Inquisition was rejuvenated in the sixteenth century,\r\nso as to reach a Protestant movement in Seville, the sailing-point for\r\nthe American fleets; and this was made an excuse for the introduction\r\nof a stricter and more vigorous policy of orthodox uniformity in Spain.\r\nThe Inquisition also found occupation in looking after heretic foreign\r\nmerchants and sailors in Spanish seaports, and Jews and Protestant\r\nGermans in the American colonies; but no Spaniards ever emigrated to\r\nAmerica to escape religious persecution.\r\n\r\nAs for France, the terrible religious wars of the sixteenth century\r\nweakened her projects of colonization, as they did all her other\r\nactivities, and divided her people into two hostile parties, one of\r\nwhich must ultimately crush out the other. The short-lived colonies\r\nestablished in the middle years of the sixteenth century in Brazil and\r\nin Florida were due largely to the hope that they might be places of\r\nrefuge for oppressed Huguenots. The first French colonies which had any\r\nsuccessful outcome, however, were the creation of the other religious\r\nparty; for Richelieu, when he took up the establishment of colonies in\r\n1624, insisted on Catholic orthodoxy in the religion of the colonists.\r\nThis precaution was doubtless due to the Huguenot efforts for\r\nindependence and their treasonable negotiations in France. In founding\r\ndistant colonies as extensions of the power of the home government, a\r\nminister could hardly permit the domination in the new colonies of a\r\nparty with which he was in deadly conflict at home. Whatever his\r\nmotive, orthodoxy was insisted on; and New France, like New Spain,\r\nbecame unbrokenly Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe English colonies, however, ultimately profited by what the French\r\ncolonies had lost. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in\r\n1685, persecution sent a stream of Huguenots to the various English\r\ncolonies of America, and added thereby a valuable and interesting\r\nstrain to the richly mingled blood of the American race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS WARS IN THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY\r\n\r\n(1520-1648)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolt of the Netherlands, which created a new and vigorous\r\nEuropean state in the sixteenth century, and a great commercial and\r\ncolonizing world-power in the seventeenth, was as much a religious as a\r\npolitical movement. The centralizing, autocratic, and unconciliatory\r\npolicy of Philip II. was probably enough in itself to have caused\r\nrebellion in the Netherlands; while the religious conflict was so\r\nbitter that it would almost certainly have caused a revolt, even if\r\nthere had been no political friction. The revolt of 1568 and the war\r\nwhich lasted till 1609, as a matter of fact, turned on causes belonging\r\nequally to both fields.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles V. visited the Netherlands in 1520, on his way to claim\r\nthe imperial crown, the twenty-two provinces then gathered into his\r\nhands were all nominally Catholic; and the large majority of the\r\npopulation were sincerely attached to Rome. Yet reformed doctrines soon\r\nmade their way into the country in several forms. In the southern and\r\ncentral states, Flanders, Brabant, Hainault, Holland, and Zealand,\r\nCalvinism entered from France; into Friesland and North Holland came\r\nmany Mennonites; in some of the towns there were Anabaptists; in the\r\ngreat commercial cities, such as Antwerp and Amsterdam, Lutherans were\r\nnumerous, some of them immigrants from Germany, some converted to that\r\nfaith through the communications between lower Germany and the adjacent\r\nprovinces of the Netherlands. [Footnote: Blok, Hist. of the People of\r\nthe Netherlands (English trans), III., 22.] Even the Catholics of the\r\nNetherlands were not of a bigoted or militant type; heresy had been\r\nwide-spread there since the thirteenth century, and the inhabitants had\r\nnot the horror of it that was felt in some more orthodox countries.\r\n[Footnote: Motley, Rise of the Dutch Republic, I., Introd, xii.]\r\n\r\nAmong the wealthy, turbulent, strong-minded, and patriotic Netherland\r\nburghers and peasantry Reformation doctrines and principles readily\r\nspread and gained acceptance; yet they were met by the most determined\r\nand harsh opposition from the government which now held the Netherlands\r\nin the hollow of its hand. In 1521 Charles V. issued from Worms an\r\nedict dooming to loss of property and death every Dutch, Flemish, or\r\nWalloon adherent of the teachings of Luther; and in 1523 two monks were\r\nburned at Brussels as first-fruits of the long and miserable harvest\r\nwhich was so abundantly reaped afterwards.\r\n\r\nA series of edicts known as the \"Placards\" was now issued by Charles,\r\nprohibiting private meetings for religious worship, reading of the\r\nScripture by laymen, discussions on questions of faith, the destruction\r\nof religious emblems, the harboring of heretics, the possession of\r\nheretical books, and, in general, all heretic or non-Catholic opinions\r\nand practices. These edicts were enforced by all the power of the civil\r\ngovernment, and by the activity of four inquisitors. The \"Placards\"\r\nreached their culmination in the edict of 1550, renewing and making\r\nmore severe all punishments for religious offences. When Charles, in\r\n1556, laid down the burden of government in favor of his son, the\r\npersecutions had numbered their hundreds, if not thousands, of victims;\r\nbut heresy had spread only the more widely, and Protestantism in its\r\nvarious forms had become only the stronger.\r\n\r\nPhilip II. entered upon the struggle with heresy even more vigorously\r\nthan his father. Even the Catholics of the Netherlands were opposed to\r\nthe enforcement of the \"Placards,\" while the heretics who were\r\nsuffering and multiplying under it were looking forward almost\r\ndesperately to some change that would make their position more\r\ntolerable. The States-General, the nearest approach to a national\r\nlegislature that the Netherlands possessed, in 1559 pleaded for\r\nmildness. It was only the Spanish ruler who was determined to apply the\r\nheresy laws in all their vigor; and when he left the Netherlands and\r\nbegan to direct their administration from Spain, the religious question\r\nbecame more and more the great unifying element in national resistance\r\nto his policy.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Orange, in the council of state, took the lead in drawing up\r\na petition to the king for the amelioration of the \"Placards\" and for\r\nthe suspension of the decrees for an inflexible orthodoxy which had\r\njust been promulgated from Trent. He pointed out the necessity of\r\nrecognizing the proximity and influence of Lutheran Germany upon the\r\nNetherlands, the actual extension of Protestantism in the provinces,\r\nand the degree to which the old church had lost its authority over the\r\nhearts of men. In words that rose in dignity and significance far above\r\nthe ordinary contests of Catholics and Protestants, he declared: \"I am\r\nCatholic, and will not deviate from religion; but I cannot approve the\r\ncustom of kings to confine men's creed and religion within arbitrary\r\nlimits.\" [Footnote: Blok, Hist. of the People of the Netherlands\r\n(English trans), III., 14.] Philip replied to this petition of the\r\nCatholic nobles of the Netherlands by the edict of Segovia, dated\r\nOctober 17, 1565, insisting more vehemently than ever before on the\r\nenforcement of the laws against heresy in all their severity, including\r\nwhat was practically the introduction of the Spanish Inquisition. On\r\nthe other hand, the Reformation pressed on with rapid strides; vast\r\ncrowds gathered outside of Tournai, Harlem, Antwerp, and other cities\r\nto listen to Calvinist preachers. Ten, twelve, and twenty thousand of\r\nthe populace assembled at a time to sing psalms and hymns and to listen\r\nto the appeals of teachers eloquent and devout, but almost invariably\r\nheretical.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable crisis was now hastening on. The lesser nobles,\r\nincluding some Calvinists, soon formed the \"Confederation,\" sent their\r\npetition to the king, and in 1567 broke out in fruitless rebellion.\r\nAlmost at the same time the mob rose in the image-breaking riots which\r\nspread like wild-fire over all the provinces except the most southern.\r\nThen came Alva, with his unlimited powers, his veteran troops, his\r\n\"Council of Blood,\" his more than ten thousand victims of political and\r\nreligious persecution, and the awful severity and barbarity that have\r\nmade his name a synonym of cruelty and heartless despotism. William of\r\nOrange brought an army into Brabant in 1568, and revolt was soon in\r\nfull progress. Even under Charles V. there had been much emigration\r\nfrom the Netherlands to Germany and England, to escape religious\r\npersecution. Now the barbarities of Alva increased the number many-\r\nfold. It was estimated that there were at one time sixty thousand Dutch\r\nand Walloon refugees living in England. By 1568 the emigrants were said\r\nto number four hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nAs the revolt progressed and the various cities expelled the officers\r\nof the Spanish governor and put themselves under the banner of Orange,\r\nthey became little oases of toleration. The instructions of William to\r\nhis lieutenants in the north in 1572 ordered them \"to restore fugitives\r\nand the banished for conscience' sake--and to see that the Word of God\r\nis preached, without, however, suffering any hindrance to the Roman\r\nChurch in the exercise of its religion.\" [Footnote: Motley, Rise of the\r\nDutch Republic, pt. iii.] By November, 1576, when the treaty known as\r\nthe Pacification of Ghent was made between Holland and Zealand on the\r\none hand and the fifteen southern provinces on the other, liberalism in\r\nreligious views had progressed as far as the power of the patriotic\r\nparty extended; and all \"Placards\" and edicts on the subject of\r\nreligion were suspended till a national assembly should take final\r\naction on the subject. At the same time it was provided that there\r\nshould be no action against the Catholic religion, outside the\r\nterritory of Holland and Zealand. [Footnote: Blok, Hist, of the People\r\nof the Netherlands (English trans.), III., 105, 106.]\r\n\r\nSoon the Flemish provinces, where Protestantism had made least headway\r\nand where distrust of the north was strong, were \"pacified\" by Don John\r\nof Austria and Alexander of Parma. The Union of Arras, of January 6,\r\n1579, became a centre of union and reconciliation to Spain and\r\nCatholicism for the fifteen southern provinces. Just three weeks\r\nafterwards the Union of Utrecht was formed, which united the seven\r\nnorthern provinces and became the basis of the free republic of the\r\nUnited Netherlands: each province was to make its own religious\r\narrangements, though toleration was secured by the provision that no\r\none should be molested or questioned on the subject of divine worship.\r\n[Footnote: Arts. 5, 9, 10, n, 12, 13, quoted in Motley, pt. vi.,\r\nchap.i.] Thus while the southern provinces set their feet in the path\r\nof a return to Roman Catholic uniformity, the northern provinces\r\npledged themselves to toleration of Catholics and of all sects of\r\nProtestants alike.\r\n\r\nToleration is to the modern student the chief interest and glory of the\r\nfoundation of the United Netherlands; but it was not toleration but\r\nProtestantism which then gave the young republic its peculiar strength,\r\nvigor, and enterprise. Even in the Pacification of Ghent and the Union\r\nof Utrecht, Holland and Zealand were recognized as Protestant states.\r\nAs the bitter struggle progressed, their Protestantism became more\r\npronounced and more militant. Exiled Calvinists from the south flocked\r\nto Amsterdam, Middleburg, Rotterdam, and other northern cities in great\r\nnumbers, intensifying the Protestant character of these communities and\r\nenriching them with capital, business ability, and an astonishingly\r\nlarge proportion of gifted men. [Footnote: Jameson, Usselinx, 27.] The\r\nformal abjuration of Philip by the United Provinces in 1581, on grounds\r\nso largely religious, could not but bring into still greater prominence\r\nthe Protestantism of the country which now claimed its independence.\r\nThe long-continued warfare that followed the assassination of the\r\nbeloved prince of Orange, the sieges, mutinies, and battles by land and\r\nsea, steadily deepened the religious and political hatred between the\r\nNetherlands and Spain.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1596 internal theological struggles between Remonstrants\r\nand Contra-Remonstrants approached the proportions of a civil war; and\r\nthe victory gained by the latter party through the intervention of the\r\nstadtholder Maurice connected religion and politics, church and state,\r\neven more clearly, and made still more intense the fiery Protestantism\r\nof the Dutch government. [Footnote: Blok, Hist of the People of the\r\nNetherlands (English trans.), III., 398-447.] Strengthened by her\r\nefforts, hardened by her struggles, awakened to vigorous life by the\r\nexhilaration of the long and arduous conflict, the little Protestant\r\nstate approached the end of the sixteenth century, enterprising in\r\ninternal plans and eager for new fields of foreign commerce. The\r\nprobability that commercial expansion would bring her into conflict\r\nwith Spain added zest to the prospect and gave promise that in\r\nextending trade, conquering distant possessions, and establishing\r\ncolonies, she would at the same time be weakening her bitterest enemy.\r\n\r\nHence the early Dutch expeditions to the Indies, the formation of the\r\nEast and West India Companies, the establishment of the colonies in\r\nBrazil, Guiana, and North America, and of commercial factories in the\r\nEast Indies, were all of them in a certain sense part of the religious\r\nand political struggle between the Netherlands and Spain. When the\r\ntwelve years' truce was signed, in 1609, those provinces which had\r\nreturned to the Spanish obedience were uniformly Catholic, but their\r\nprosperity and international significance had disappeared. The\r\nindependent provinces, on the other hand, were, for all their\r\ntoleration, almost uniformly Protestant, and they were already one of\r\nthe great maritime and commercial powers of Europe. [Footnote: Blok,\r\nHist of the People of the Netherlands (English trans), III., 326-334.]\r\n\r\nThe United Netherlands speedily colonized New Amsterdam, Guiana, Cape\r\nColony, Java, and other places, with a population persistent in\r\nProtestantism and in many race characteristics. Unfortunately for\r\nHolland the number of her emigrants was never great enough to enable\r\nher permanently to play a great part in the history of colonization.\r\nThe Dutch are not an emigrating people. Yet those who did emigrate\r\ncarried with them such an assertive character and so highly developed a\r\ngroup of institutions that they exercised a deep and permanent\r\ninfluence over communities like New York, in which they soon ceased to\r\nbe the dominant element; while their institutions in Holland made such\r\na strong impression upon English sojourners in their midst that some of\r\ntheir characteristics reappeared long afterwards in American colonies\r\nin which no Dutchman had ever settled. [Footnote: Douglas Campbell,\r\nPuritan in Holland.]\r\n\r\nThe Reformation, with the wars to which it gave rise, made Germany for\r\na time the most conspicuous state in Europe, but its ultimate effect\r\nwas to reduce that state to a degree of material poverty, political\r\ninsignificance, and intellectual torpidity unknown before in her\r\nexperience. Civil war was long delayed; the political necessities and\r\nthe astute policy of Charles V., the conservative instincts and\r\npatriotic scruples of Luther, and the doubtful position of many of the\r\nGerman provinces and cities, long prevented any attempt by the emperor\r\nto enforce the orthodoxy required by the Diet of Worms, and induced the\r\nLutherans to go more than halfway in accepting the policy of\r\npostponement. [Footnote: Armstrong, The Emperor Charles V., I., 201-\r\n203, 240-256,] Yet even this early period was troubled by successive\r\nminor outbreaks of violence. The \"Knights' War\" of 1523, the Peasants'\r\nRevolt of 1524 and 1525, the Zwinglian wars in Switzerland in 1531, and\r\nthe Anabaptist outbreak at Munster in 1534 were all connected with the\r\nreligious ferment of the times.\r\n\r\nFrom 1530, when the League of Schmalkald was formed to unite the\r\nProtestant princes and cities, Germany really belonged to two camps,\r\nand civil war was only a question of time. The time came in 1546, the\r\nyear of Luther's death, when Charles was at last free from foreign\r\ncomplications and could make the attempt to reintroduce conformity into\r\nGermany. The Schmalkaldic War, although marked by a series of imperial\r\nsuccesses and temporarily closed by a triumphant truce in 1548, was\r\nsoon renewed, and the Peace of Passau of 1552 was a general compromise,\r\nrepresenting rather the weariness of war and the jealousies of the\r\nvarious powers of Germany than any permanent political of religious\r\nequilibrium. An attempt was made to establish a more lasting settlement\r\nin the conference of Augsburg in 1555. Here the terms of the recent\r\ntreaty were put in more formal shape: Lutheranism was given legal\r\nrecognition; all religious disputes should be settled by peaceful\r\nmeans; in legal causes between a Protestant and a Catholic the Imperial\r\nHight Court of Justice should be composed of an equal number of\r\nCatholics and Protestants.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, certain compromises were then introduced which were\r\ndestined to be fatal to the permanency of the religious and political\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n1. Instead of individual toleration, as was originally proposed, the\r\nprinciple was adopted which has become known as cujus regio ejus\r\nreligio--that is to say, each prince or imperial city should choose\r\nbetween Catholicism and Lutheranism; and thereafter all inhabitants\r\nmust conform, or, if unwilling to do so, must expatriate themselves.\r\nThe unstable equilibrium of the empire was thus transferred to the\r\nindividual states, and each was threatened with internal revolution\r\nwhenever there was a change in the prevailing religious views of the\r\ninhabitants or the personal beliefs of the prince.\r\n\r\n2. A second compromise was reached by providing that all ecclesiastical\r\nproperty seized by temporal governments down to the close of the late\r\nwar should be guaranteed to its new possessors; but that for the future\r\nthe process of secularization should cease. Thus an artificial obstacle\r\nwas placed in the way of the avarice or the desire for reform of the\r\nProtestant princes, at the very time they were given increased control\r\nin their own states.\r\n\r\n3. The \"ecclesiastical reservation\" made an exception to the right of\r\nterritorial independence in religion in the case of the ecclesiastical\r\nstates, which were so numerous in Germany. If any archbishop, bishop,\r\nor abbot, who was also a secular prince, should become a Lutheran, he\r\nmust resign his office and divest himself of his power and\r\njurisdiction, which would pass to his Catholic successor. This\r\nprovision deprived Protestant subjects of ecclesiastical princes of all\r\nprospect of religious freedom, and doomed them to compulsory\r\nreconciliation with the Catholic Church or to exile, except for certain\r\nrights guaranteed to them by the treaty.\r\n\r\n4. The compromises of Augsburg were compromises between Catholics and\r\nLutherans only, and neither Calvinists nor Zwinglians were given\r\nrecognition in its terms, although Calvinism was destined to be the\r\ngreat aggressive force of the Reformation, making an appeal to the\r\nmasses of the people and taking a fundamental hold upon its adherents\r\nbeyond anything which Lutheranism, or indeed any other form of the\r\nReformation, ever obtained.\r\n\r\nThe agreement reached in 1555, incomplete and unstable as it seemed,\r\nremained the foundation of an outward if somewhat troubled religious\r\npeace for more than sixty years. Yet a renewal of the conflict was\r\nthreatened from time to time, and in 1618 the terrible Thirty Years'\r\nWar broke out. The earlier contests had been civil wars only, the\r\nrenewed war was no longer merely a German struggle. In 1625 Christian\r\nIV., king of Denmark, entered the war as leader on the Protestant side,\r\nonly to yield to the perseverance of Tilly, the general of the Catholic\r\narmies, and to the genius of Wallenstein, the representative of Emperor\r\nFerdinand; and to retire in 1629, leaving north Germany more completely\r\nthan before at the mercy of the emperor and of the Catholic party.\r\nScarcely a year later Gustavus Adolphus, full of enthusiasm for the\r\nProtestant cause and provided with funds from France, brought his\r\nveteran regiments and his military ability from Sweden into Germany,\r\nand fought in consecutive years his three wonderful campaigns. After\r\nthe death of the \"Lion of the North,\" in 1632, the \"Swedish period\"\r\nendured still two years; and when, in 1634, Catholic and Protestant\r\nprinces entered upon a truce they made terms upon an equality, though\r\nthere was even yet but little promise of a permanent settlement.\r\n\r\nJust before the fatal battle of Lutzen, in the midst of military\r\npreparations, a decisive step was taken by Gustavus which ultimately\r\nled to the creation of one more American colony. Ever since the\r\nintroduction of new issues. One after another, foreign states were\r\ndrawn into the struggle until a mere German civil war had developed\r\ninto a general European conflict, in which foreigners were struggling\r\nfor German territory. Catholics made alliances with Lutherans and with\r\nCalvinists, until what had begun as a religious struggle became a\r\npurely political contest among unpatriotic German princes and ambitious\r\nneighbors of Germany contending for power and prestige.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the peace of 1648, political questions had been settled,\r\nterritorial changes agreed upon, the Netherlands and Switzerland\r\ndefinitely separated from the empire, Alsace surrendered to France, and\r\nmuch of Pomerania to Sweden, the religious conflict was brought to an\r\nend as far as possible by returning to the old plan of the treaty of\r\nAugsburg, except that such toleration as was then granted to Catholics\r\nand Lutherans was now extended to Calvinists also. To these provisions\r\nsome further extensions of religious liberty were added by securing\r\nguarantees of protection to subjects differing in their religion from\r\ntheir princes and by including in the highest imperial tribunal a\r\ncertain number of Protestants. [Footnote: Lamprecht, Deutsche\r\nGeschichte, V., sect ii., 764.] The material sufferings and losses of\r\nGermany during the war were almost beyond description. [Footnote:\r\nErdmannsdorffer, Deutsche Geschichte, 1648-1740, I., 100-115] The\r\narmies, made tip largely of soldiers of different nationalities,\r\nwithout attachment to the countries through which they marched, without\r\ninterest in the questions at issue, without a regular commissariat,\r\noften without pay, brutalized by long campaigning and repeated sacks of\r\ncities, followed by an immense rabble of non-combatant men, women, and\r\nchildren, were a barbarian horde, and ravaged the lands in which they\r\nwere established like a fire or a pestilence. The tortures they\r\ninflicted upon the peasantry and the citizens, the robbery, the\r\noutrages, the wanton destruction, pressed close to the limits of human\r\nendurance, and seemed almost to threaten the extermination of the\r\npopulation. The prosperity of the cities was crushed by war\r\ncontributions, even when they escaped being plundered like Magdeburg;\r\nand the debasement of the coinage practised by the emperor and the\r\nprinces bore hardly upon all who bought or sold. [Footnote: Gindeley,\r\nHistory of the Thirty Years' War (English trans.), II., 390-395] During\r\nthe later campaigns of the war military operations in many regions\r\nbecame almost impracticable from the very impoverishment of the\r\ncountry; no sustenance existed for friend or for enemy; population in\r\nsome parts was almost destroyed, and it was everywhere extensively\r\ndisplaced. [Footnote: Ibid., 398.] The conservatism, the settled\r\nrooting of the people in the soil, acquired and inherited property,\r\nmoral and material fixity, were all alike disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe half-century that followed 1648 did but little to restore\r\nprosperity or repose to Germany. The western provinces especially were\r\nthe scene of frequently renewed warfare. The territorial ambitions of\r\nLouis XIV. were directed to the German lands which lay on the eastern\r\nborder of France, and there was no strength in the empire to resist his\r\naggressions or to make him fear either defeat or reprisals. Even the\r\nEuropean coalitions which forced upon him successive treaties did not\r\nprevent renewed attacks or heal the scars of the repeated devastations\r\nof the lower and the upper Rhine country. The culmination of this\r\nperiod of suffering was the terrible ravaging of the Palatinate, in\r\n1688, when the fertile region about Heidelberg, Mannheim, Speyer, and\r\nWorms was harried and burned and pillaged by the soldiers of Louis,\r\nwith the same brutality and more destructiveness than the wild Swedish\r\nand mercenary armies of the Thirty Years' War had used.\r\n\r\nA people with an experience such as that of the Germans in the\r\nseventeenth century was thenceforth easily drawn away from home. One\r\ngeneration of continuous warfare throughout all Germany, followed by\r\nanother generation of intermittent invasion from France, and closed by\r\na crisis of rapine and devastation, made hundreds of thousands of the\r\nGerman people homeless, despairing, and eager for escape. It was this\r\nsituation of the people, combined with the religious condition before\r\ndescribed, that made Germany the best recruiting-ground for American\r\ncolonists to be found in Europe. Before the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury a stream of emigration set from Germany towards America which\r\nfurnished to Pennsylvania one-third of her pre-Revolutionary\r\ninhabitants, and made a considerable part of the population of several\r\nof the other colonies.\r\n\r\nA second effect of the Thirty Years' War was the practical dissolution\r\nof the empire and the loss by the emperor of all centralized control\r\nover its policy. This was a cumulative result of the war rather than a\r\ndefinite provision of the peace. The princes, nobles, and cities had so\r\nfrequently allied themselves with foreign states against the emperor\r\nand against one another, their policy had been so constantly regulated\r\nby their own interests alone, in entire disregard of those of the\r\nnation at large, and the religious divisions had been settled on such a\r\nsectional basis, that there was now no thought of derogating from their\r\nindependence for the sake of the central power of Germany. By Article\r\nVIII. of the treaty of peace all German states were definitely\r\npermitted to form independent alliances among themselves and with\r\nforeign states, so long as these were not directed against either the\r\nemperor or the empire. [Footnote: Lamprecht, Deutsche Geschtchte, V.,\r\nSection 2, pp 765, 766.] As a matter of fact, the bond of union among\r\nthe states of Germany had become so weak as to be almost non-existent.\r\nThe emperor was the actual ruler of the Hapsburg dominions and the\r\nnominal head of the empire; but Germany was a geographical rather than\r\na national expression, and its head could play no part as a national\r\nruler outside of his immediate hereditary dominions. Germany had many\r\ninterests in America. Martin Behaim, Regiomontanus, and other German\r\nscientists contributed largely to the development of the science of\r\nnavigation during the period of discovery; Waldseemuller suggested the\r\nname that has been universally accepted for the New World; the numerous\r\nprinting-presses of Germany did much to make known to Europe the\r\nhistory of the exploration and early conquests and the wonders of the\r\nIndies; under Charles V. the empire was brought closely into connection\r\nwith Spain, the greatest colonizing power of the seventeenth century;\r\nher Fuggers, Welsers, and other capitalists provided much of the means\r\nfor the early Spanish voyages, and for a time held extensive grants in\r\nVenezuela under the Spanish crown; and her teeming emigrants furnished\r\na large part of the colonial population. Yet Germany as a nation has,\r\nof all the nations of Europe, exercised the least influence on the\r\nfortunes of America. Neither the emperor nor any German prince has ever\r\nexercised any direct or indirect power over any American territory.\r\nMany causes may have contributed to this failure, but the most\r\neffective was doubtless the Thirty Years' War. The religious disunion,\r\nthe material impoverishment, and the political insignificance which\r\nthis war caused, during the most important colonizing century, excluded\r\nGermany as a nation from a role among the European powers which have\r\nheld control over parts of the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH CHURCH AND THE CATHOLICS\r\n\r\n(1534-1660)\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland passed through the crisis of the Reformation without a civil\r\nwar, yet no country of Europe found greater difficulty in coming to a\r\nreligious equilibrium after that change. Though actual rebellion was\r\nnipped in the bud wherever it appeared, as in the Pilgrimage of Grace\r\nof 1536 and in the Rising of the North of 1569, yet between those\r\nyears, and long after the second rising, religious passions were\r\nembittered to the very verge of outbreak. In the early period of the\r\nReformation changes were rapid and violent, and during more than a\r\ncentury and a half after Protestantism was established hostile\r\nlegislation imposed heavy burdens upon all those who differed from the\r\ndominant party in religious faith.\r\n\r\nWhen England became a colonizing country at the opening of the\r\nseventeenth century, the effect of the religious changes up to that\r\ntime had been to produce four well-marked religious parties among her\r\npeople--Churchmen, Catholics, Puritans, and Independents. First in\r\norder came the adherents of the established church, a church which was\r\nin a very real sense the creation of Queen Elizabeth and of her times--\r\nfor all that had gone before was unstable and tentative, and might\r\nreadily have been altered by a ruler of different character or policy.\r\nWhen Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1558 the great body of the people\r\nof England, from a religious point of view, was still a fluid mass, a\r\nsea accustomed to be drawn, like the tide, by the planet that ruled the\r\nsky, whether an Erastian Henry VIII., a Catholic Mary, or a Protestant\r\nProtector Somerset.\r\n\r\nElizabeth declared at her accession that she would not allow her people\r\nto swerve to the right hand or the left from the religion established\r\nby law; and in the main she succeeded in carrying out this policy. The\r\nprayer-book, the articles of religion, the supremacy of the queen, the\r\nuniformity of service, the practices and doctrines of the official\r\nEnglish church during the long reign of Elizabeth, meant something very\r\ndefinite and made the established church an objective reality. Of\r\ncourse she learned, as other sovereigns have learned, that even the\r\nwill of a king may break against the rock of religious conviction, and\r\nlarge numbers of the people of England during her reign remained, or\r\nbecame, dissatisfied with the established church.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when Elizabeth died Anglicanism was the national church\r\nin a sense in which it had not been before, and in exactly the same\r\nsense as that in which the Roman Catholic church was the church of\r\nSpain. A generation had grown up which had seen no other religious\r\nsystem in authority, whose beliefs and duties were taught them by its\r\nclergy, and whose sentiments and devotion naturally gathered around it\r\nas their object. This religious system, therefore, was strongly\r\nintrenched: it had all the authoritativeness of law, all the sanction\r\nof patriotic feeling in a period of intense patriotism, and the support\r\nof much sound learning; besides, the church was fast becoming hallowed\r\nby tradition and beautified to the imagination by sentiment. Yet for\r\nvarious reasons the Anglican church failed to obtain the allegiance of\r\nthe whole English nation.\r\n\r\nThe second of the four great religious classes, the Catholics, held\r\nallegiance to a still older and more imposing organization. However\r\nclear the argument of English churchmen that the Anglican body was the\r\nchurch founded by the apostles and enduring continuously in England\r\nthrough all the intervening centuries, the \"old church\" was still to\r\nmany the church of which the pope was the earthly head. From the time\r\nthat Henry VIII. attacked the supremacy of the pope and many of the\r\ncharacteristic doctrines and practices of the mediaeval church, a party\r\nseparate from the national church came into being, which clung\r\nfaithfully to that system.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the English Roman Catholics as a separate body from\r\nthe established English church may be considered to date from the\r\nresignation of Sir Thomas More from the chancellorship in 1532. During\r\nthe remainder of Henry's reign their position was equivocal and\r\ndangerous, a number of conspicuous Catholics accepting martyrdom under\r\nthe laws against treason, when brought to the test of the acceptance or\r\nrejection of the king's claim to the headship of the English church.\r\nUnder the enlightened rule of Somerset they were not persecuted, but\r\nunder his successor, and under the personal rule of Edward VI., they\r\nfared much worse. [Footnote: Pollard, England Under Protector Somerset,\r\n110-120, 258-264, 322] The time of consolation came under Queen Mary,\r\nwhen for a space of five years (1553-1558) the English church and\r\nEnglish Catholicism again became identical.\r\n\r\nElizabeth on her accession had no antagonism to the Roman Catholics as\r\nsuch. Neither in doctrine nor in ceremonial was there any essential\r\nbreach between Elizabeth and the Catholic church; and for a moment the\r\nworld watched to see what her decision would be. [Footnote: Maitland,\r\n\"Defender of the Faith\" (Eng Hist Review, XV.,120).] Yet the nature of\r\nher position dictated to her a return to the ecclesiastical position of\r\nher father, and an acquiescence in the main results of the Protestant\r\ndevelopment under Edward VI. She accepted the requirements of the\r\npolicy readily enough, and by the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity of\r\n1559 [Footnote: I Eliz., chaps, i., ii. ] the English Catholics again\r\nbecame a proscribed body, living in disobedience to the law, subject to\r\nsevere pains and penalties for any speech or action against the\r\nestablished church, and even for the negative offence of absence from\r\nits religious services.\r\n\r\nThe disabilities of the Catholics according to the laws passed at the\r\nopening of the reign of Elizabeth were as follows: 1. No Catholic could\r\nhold any office or employment under the crown, or any ecclesiastical\r\noffice in England, or receive any university degree: for all such\r\npersons were required to take an oath renouncing the authority of the\r\npope, and acknowledging the headship of the queen in ecclesiastical\r\nmatters. [Footnote: Ibid., chap, ii., sub-section 19-25.] 2. No\r\nCatholic could attend mass: the service of the prayer-book being\r\nrequired at all meetings for worship in England. [Footnote: Ibid.,\r\nchap, ii., sub-section 3-8.] 3. No Catholic could remain away from the\r\nregular services of the established church: as the law required that\r\n\"all and every person and persons inhabiting within the realm or any\r\nother the queen's majesty's dominions shall diligently and faithfully,\r\nhaving no lawful or reasonable excuse to be absent, endeavor themselves\r\nto resort to their parish church or chapel accustomed ... upon every\r\nSunday and other days ordained and used to be kept as holy days, and\r\nthen and there to abide orderly and soberly during the time of the\r\ncommon prayer, preachings, or other service of God there to be used and\r\nministered.\" [Footnote: I Eliz., chap, ii., Section 14.] 4. No Catholic\r\ncould speak, write, or circulate any arguments or appeals in favor of\r\nthe ecclesiastical claims of the Catholic church or in derogation of\r\nthe royal supremacy or of the prayer-book.\r\n\r\nThe penalties for violation of these laws varied from a fine of one\r\nshilling for absence from church on a Sunday or holy day to the\r\nterrible customary punishment for treason in the case of repeated\r\nconviction for supporting the claims of the pope. These fundamental\r\ndisabilities remained in existence during the whole of the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries. They were added to from time to time as the\r\nreligious conflict in England, and in Europe at large, became more\r\nembittered; although, on the other hand, there were occasional periods\r\nwhen the exigencies of policy or the sympathies of the sovereign\r\ntemporarily suspended their enforcement. They remained the fundamental\r\nlaw long after the Act of Toleration of 1689 made easy the burdens of\r\nother Nonconformists, and until the gradual progress of enlightenment\r\nin the eighteenth century led to a willing neglect to enforce them; and\r\nthey disappeared only in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe tendency during the reign of Elizabeth was constantly towards an\r\nincrease in the severity of the laws against \"popish recusants,\" as\r\nthose who refused to conform to the established church were called, and\r\nto greater rigor in their application. At four successive periods\r\nduring that reign additions were made to the disabilities and\r\nsufferings imposed by law upon Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\n1. An act of 1563 extended the lines of restriction so that the oath of\r\nsupremacy must be taken by a much greater number of officials--by all\r\nschool-masters, lawyers, and petty officers of court, and by all\r\nmembers of the House of Commons; and so that the first refusal of any\r\nperson to take it, as well as the first occasion on which any one\r\nshould in writing or speech support the claims of the pope, should be\r\npunished by confiscation and outlawry, the second offence by the\r\npenalties of treason. [Footnote: Eliz., chap. i.] 2. The difficulties\r\nof the Catholics were increased by the coming, in 1568, of Mary Queen\r\nof Scots to England, where she became a permanent centre of Catholic\r\ndisaffection and hopes; by the Rebellion of the North in 1569; and by\r\nthe papal bull of deposition of the queen in 1570. The laws at once\r\nreflected the anger and alarm of Parliament and ministers, and their\r\ncare \"for the surety and preservation of the queen's most royal person,\r\nin whom consisteth all the happiness and comfort of the whole state and\r\nsubjects of the realm.\" [Footnote: 13 Eliz., chap, i., Section I.] From\r\n1571 to 1575 four new treason laws, [Footnote: Ibid., chaps, i, ii.; 14\r\nEliz., chaps, i., ii.] directed against sympathizers with Mary and\r\nbringers of bulls from Rome, recall the savage legislation of Henry\r\nVIII. under somewhat similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n3. A third series of additions to the anti-Catholic code was called out\r\nby the efforts of the Jesuits, from 1579 onward, to reconquer the\r\nheretical nations and especially England, for the church. Hence, in\r\n1581, the mere attempt to convert any subject of the queen to Roman\r\nCatholicism, as well as the acceptance of such reconciliation with the\r\nchurch, was made treason; the saying or hearing of the mass was\r\nforbidden under penalty of heavy fine and long imprisonment; recusants\r\nwho were absent from church a month at a time were fined 20 pounds a\r\nmonth for the length of time for which they stayed away; [Footnote: 23\r\nEliz., chap. i.] and by a later law the crown was allowed, in case of\r\nrecusancy, instead of the fine, to seize two-thirds of the property of\r\nthe offender. [Footnote: Ibid., chap. ii.]\r\n\r\nCertain offences which Catholics might be especially expected to\r\ncommit, such as \"by setting or erecting any figure or by casting of\r\nnativities or by calculations or by any prophesying, witchcraft,\r\nconjuration, or other like unlawful means whatsoever, seek to know, and\r\nshall set forth by express words, deeds, or writings how long her\r\nmajesty shall live, or who shall reign king or queen of this realm of\r\nEngland after her highness's decease,\" were made punishable by death\r\nand confiscation of goods. In 1585 all Jesuits and Catholic priests\r\ntrained abroad were banished on pain of death, and all English subjects\r\nstudying abroad in one of those Jesuit schools, which had already\r\nbecome famous as the best schools in Christendom, were required to\r\nreturn to England immediately and take the oath of supremacy or suffer\r\nthe penalties of treason.\r\n\r\n4. Within the next few years came the execution of Mary, the war with\r\nSpain, the defeat of the Armada, and the definite passing of the crisis\r\nof Elizabeth's reign. Nevertheless, the year 1593 was marked by an \"act\r\nagainst popish recusants,\" which required all English Catholics to\r\nremain within five miles of their homes, and provided for a still\r\ncloser search for Jesuits and priests. [Footnote: 35 Eliz., chap. ii.]\r\n\r\nThus an augmenting body of oppressive law, in addition to their\r\nfundamental disabilities, burdened the English Catholics at the\r\naccession of James I. in 1603. That event they may well have looked\r\nforward to and welcomed with joy. James was the son of Mary of\r\nScotland, for whom many of them had made such deep personal sacrifices\r\nand on whose account all had been made to suffer. He was known to be a\r\nman of moderate spirit, easy good-nature, and philosophic breadth of\r\nmind. Circumstances, by relieving England from the fear of invasion\r\nfrom Spain, and by establishing the Protestant succession, might be\r\nconsidered to have left the way open for the admission of a more\r\ngenerous and tolerant treatment of the Catholic minority. The king\r\ncontrolled the enforcement or the non-enforcement of the law; his word\r\ncould put the machinery of the courts, high and low, into motion for\r\npurposes of persecution; or, on the other hand, could open the prison\r\ndoors to those already incarcerated, and restrain the indictment of\r\nthose amenable to the law. James might fairly be expected to have the\r\nwill, as he undoubtedly had the power, to treat the Catholics with\r\ngreater leniency.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, parliamentary and popular antagonism to the Roman\r\nCatholics had to be contended with. Notwithstanding the legal supremacy\r\nand complete predominance of the Anglican church, there was still a\r\nwide-spread fear of the \"usurped power and jurisdiction of the bishop\r\nof Rome\"; and much patriotic hatred of the Catholic enemies of England\r\nand of their sympathizers within the realm. This national sentiment was\r\nstrongly reinforced by the fanatical Puritan fervor of opposition to\r\n\"the devilish positions and doctrines whereon popery is built and\r\ntaught.\" The Gunpowder Plot of 1605, in which Catesby, Guy Fawkes, and\r\nother Catholic conspirators showed themselves ready to sacrifice the\r\nking, his family, his ministers, and members of Parliament, filled\r\nJames for a while with fears for his own safety. If James, therefore,\r\nshould favor the Catholics he must do so in opposition to the\r\noverwhelming public opinion of the people of England and to his own\r\ntimidity. What would be his policy? Would the persecuted minority be\r\ntaken under the protection of the crown? Or would their position remain\r\nas it had been for half a century, or even be made worse?\r\n\r\nUpon the answer to this question depended the happiness or unhappiness\r\nof the Catholics in England and the likelihood or unlikelihood that\r\nmany of them would emigrate. Should their position become intolerable,\r\nthose who could would either take refuge in one of the Catholic states\r\nof the continent or find an asylum in those boundless lands claimed by\r\nEngland across the sea. The minds of men through all Europe were\r\nturning towards America, not only as a sphere for trade and a base for\r\nthe fighting out of Old-World quarrels, [Footnote: Zuniga to the king\r\nof Spain, December 24, 1606, and September 22,1607, in Brown, Genesis\r\nof the United States, I., 88-90, 116-118.] but as a place of settlement\r\nfor men who could not conform to their Old-World religious\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nBefore the reign of James was over Sir George Calvert obtained a\r\ncharter for Avalon, in Newfoundland, the ambiguity of whose terms made\r\nit possible to take Catholic priests and settlers there; and in 1632 he\r\nreceived in exchange for this a charter for Maryland, under which\r\nCatholics held all official positions and Jesuit missionaries carried\r\non their work. The British island of Montserrat, in the West Indies,\r\nappears to have been settled in 1634 by Catholic refugees from\r\nVirginia; [Footnote: Eggleston, Beginners of a Nation, 261, n. 9.] and\r\nthere were other floating proposals to colonize English and Irish\r\nCatholics in America. [Footnote: Cal. of State Pap., 1628, p. 95.] It\r\nwas evidently quite within the bounds of possibility that Catholic\r\ncolonies should be established in those \"other your highness's\r\ndominions,\" from which the House of Commons in 1623 especially\r\npetitioned that Romanists should be excluded. [Footnote: Rushworth,\r\nHistorical Collections, I., 141.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the policy of James and of his son and successor\r\nCharles towards the Catholics had little consistency, and shows an\r\nalternation of leniency and increased severity, reflecting the varying\r\ninclinations of the king and the changing exigencies of external and\r\ninternal politics. During the first two years of his reign James\r\nlightened their burdens, in accordance with the promises of his first\r\nspeech in Parliament, \"so much as time, occasion, or law should\r\npermit.\" [Footnote: Prothero, Statutes and Constitutional Documents,\r\n284.] The Gunpowder Plot then thoroughly frightened and angered the\r\nking and justified the House of Commons in its protests against\r\nleniency to the Catholics. In 1606 two long detailed statutes\r\n[Footnote: 3 and 4 James I., chaps. iv., v.] were enacted, carrying\r\nmuch further in principle the persecuting provisions of the law under\r\nElizabeth, increasing the burdens upon the conscience, the purse, and\r\nthe liberty of Catholics, and specifying the most minute arrangements\r\nfor the enforcement of the law and the discovery of those who were\r\nsecretly Romanists.\r\n\r\nBefore many years a change came, due principally to the interest of\r\nJames in the scheme of obtaining a Spanish bride for his son, and to\r\nhis increasing subserviency to Gondomar, the shrewd Spanish minister.\r\nThe king of Spain would not listen to any negotiations for the hand of\r\nhis sister, unless the persecution of his co-religionists in England\r\nwas stopped; and James, in order to carry out his foreign policy,\r\nblinded by his admiration for the Spaniard, and always prone to follow\r\nthe line of least resistance, promised what he certainly could not\r\nperform, the parliamentary repeal of the anti-Catholic laws.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he performed what he could, and ordered the suspension of\r\ntheir enforcement. In 1622 the lord keeper of the privy seal wrote to\r\nthe judges that \"it is his majesty's pleasure that they make no\r\nniceness or difficulty to extend the princely favor to all such as they\r\nshall find prisoners in the jails of their circuits for any church\r\nrecusancy or refusing the oath of supremacy or dispensing of popish\r\nbooks, or any other point of recusancy that shall concern religion only\r\nand not matters of state.\" [Footnote: Rushworth, Historical\r\nCollections, I., 63.] A vast number of Catholics were, in this year,\r\nreleased on bail or freed completely from prosecution. When the Spanish\r\nmarriage negotiations failed, just before the close of the reign of\r\nJames, Parliament again petitioned the king to enforce the old penal\r\nlaws, at last with success; and a momentary wave of severity towards\r\nthe Catholics spread over England.\r\n\r\nSpain was not the only Catholic country with which England was in\r\nnegotiation. The marriage of Charles with Henrietta Maria of France\r\nfollowed close upon his accession to the throne. The conditions of the\r\nmarriage treaty called for greater leniency to the Catholics, and the\r\ninfluence of the queen secured it, though not in the degree promised.\r\nYet on the whole the attitude of the crown and of the judges during the\r\nperiod from 1625 to 1640 was favorable to the Catholics; and although\r\nLaud was not plotting to hand over the English church to Rome, as was\r\nthe popular belief, he was too sympathetic with the spirit of Roman\r\nCatholicism to put into force the savage laws against it which were\r\nupon the statute-book.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 Laud fell, the hand of the king was removed from the helm, and\r\nthe domination of the Long Parliament and the protectorate for the next\r\ntwenty years meant the bitter persecution of the Catholics; while the\r\nRestoration, in 1660, saw a partial toleration of them, preparatory to\r\nthe Declaration of Indulgence and the active efforts of James II. in\r\ntheir favor twenty-five years later.\r\n\r\nThrough all this succession of alternately rigorous and lenient\r\napplications of the harsh laws of the statute-book, as a matter of fact\r\nfew Catholics left England, and no American colony remained for any\r\nconsiderable length of time a Catholic community. The reasons for this\r\nresult are not hard to find. In the first place, it may well be\r\nquestioned whether the position of the Catholics in England was ever so\r\nbad as one would expect to find it from reading the laws and\r\nparliamentary proceedings. In all Tudor and Stuart legislation there\r\nwas a wide chasm between the passage of the law and its enforcement;\r\nthe statute-book is loaded with laws that were never carried out, or\r\nwere put into force only to the most limited extent. The laws against\r\nthe Catholics certainly remained largely unenforced.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the English Catholics were never without hope of an\r\namelioration of their state at home. The most natural time for a great\r\nCatholic exodus was in the later years of the reign of James I. and the\r\nearly years of Charles I., when the foundations alike of Virginia and\r\nNew England were being laid, and when Maryland was offering a basis on\r\nwhich either a Catholic or a Protestant community might presumably have\r\nbeen built up; but this was just the period when the influence of the\r\ncrown was most consistently used in favor of the Catholics at home.\r\nThey might fairly hope that a better day was dawning for them, when the\r\npowerful interposition of Spain and France was willingly accepted by\r\nJames and Charles in their favor. The special time when emigration\r\nseemed most practicable was also the time when the occasion for it was\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is to be noted that no American colony ever reached the\r\nposition in which it could provide a positively secure refuge to\r\nCatholics. Maryland wavered from toleration to Catholicism, then to\r\nAnglicanism and to Puritanism, and then back to toleration; but never\r\nat any time was it a Catholic settlement in the sense in which\r\nMassachusetts belonged to the Puritans or Pennsylvania was the special\r\nhome of the Quakers. English Catholics, hesitating between emigration\r\nand the further endurance of their ills at home, would feel no\r\nirresistible attraction in the dubious toleration of any of the\r\ncolonies. [Footnote: Tyler, England in America, chaps, vii., viii.]\r\n\r\nLastly, it is to be noticed that the great proportion of the English\r\nCatholics were not of the emigrating classes. Many of them were of the\r\nnobility and gentry, and therefore not of the ordinary stuff of which\r\ncolonists were made. It is quite possible that the same conservative\r\ntendencies which held them to the old church held them to their old\r\nhomes. If they had been as easily detached from their native soil as\r\nthe Puritans and Quakers, one cannot doubt that some great migration\r\ncomparable to that of those two bodies would have taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH PURITANS AND THE SECTS (1550-1689)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe multitude of Englishmen other than Catholics, who, at the opening\r\nof the seventeenth century, were dissatisfied with the church of\r\nEngland as by law established, may be grouped under the general name of\r\nPuritans; although as time passed on various newly organized religious\r\nbodies formed themselves from among them, so that two more religious\r\nclasses, at least, have to be differentiated. The roots of Puritanism\r\nare to be found in the characteristics of human temperament.\r\nConservatives and radicals will always exist; the Puritans were those\r\nwho carried or tried to carry the principles and ideas of the\r\nReformation to their logical and rigorous conclusion. Such men as\r\nLatimer, Cranmer, and many of the theologians of the reign of Edward\r\nVI., were already steadily approaching the fundamental position of the\r\nPuritans, as their thought developed, long before the foreign influence\r\nof the reign of Queen Mary became effective and the modified\r\nProtestantism of Elizabeth was introduced.\r\n\r\nIf the government had kept its hands off, England would have divided\r\ninto two camps, that of the Catholics and that of a Puritanically\r\nreformed church. The Anglican system was an artificial one, a\r\ncompromise established under the influence of the crown and kept in\r\npower by royal determination till it eventually won the devotion, the\r\nloyalty, or at least the deliberate acceptance of the great body of\r\nmoderate and conservative Englishmen. Catholics and Puritans were the\r\nlogical opposites, and not Catholics and Anglicans, nor yet Anglicans\r\nand Puritans.\r\n\r\nYet in a more immediate sense Mary gave occasion to the rise of\r\nPuritanism by driving into banishment many of the more devout\r\nProtestants of her day. At Frankfort, Strasburg, Basel, Zurich, and\r\nGeneva groups of these English exiles gathered, formed congregations\r\nworshipping together; developed, apart from the restrictions of\r\ngovernment, the logical tendencies of their religious ideas; and in\r\nmany cases came under the powerful influence of continental reformers.\r\nEspecially at Frankfort [Footnote: Hinds, The England of Elizabeth, 12-\r\n67.] and at Geneva was the religious life of these Protestant\r\ncommunities at white heat; and controversies were then begun and\r\nprinciples adopted which dominated all the later life of these\r\nEnglishmen, and were handed down to their successors in England and\r\nAmerica as party cries through more than a century. When the ordeal of\r\nMary's reign was over, the exiled for conscience' sake returned to\r\nEngland, but they formed already a body divergent from the church as it\r\nwas then established.\r\n\r\nDuring Elizabeth's reign three stages of the development of Puritanism\r\ngave occasion for corresponding conflicts with the crown and for making\r\nmore clear the differences between Anglican and Puritan. During the\r\nfirst decade of the reign, Puritanism meant a protest against certain\r\nof the ceremonies and formulas and vestments required of clergymen by\r\nthe law. The sign of the cross on the child's forehead in baptism, the\r\ncelebration of saints' days, insistence on kneeling to receive the\r\ncommunion, the use of church organs, the changing of robes during the\r\nservice, and even the wearing of a surplice or a square cap, were to\r\nmany earnest souls survivals of \"popery\" and temptations to\r\nsuperstition. The clergy who held such beliefs tried by resolutions in\r\nconvocation to change the practices of the church: but notwithstanding\r\nthe large votes in their favor they were still in the minority and were\r\ndefeated. [Footnote: Strype, Annals, I., 500-505.]\r\n\r\nThen individual ministers began to disregard the law, and either to\r\nneglect the use of certain requirements of the prayer-book altogether\r\nor to change the forms there laid down. The archbishop and the Court of\r\nHigh Commission issued detailed instructions insisting on observance of\r\nthe authorized form of worship; [Footnote: Prothero, Statutes and\r\nConstitutional Documents, 191-194.] but the ministers declared that\r\nthey owed obedience to God rather than to man, and either resigned\r\ntheir pastorates or, encouraged by their congregations, continued to\r\ndisobey the law and the archiepiscopal injunctions. It was at this time\r\nand in this connection that the word \"Puritan\" came into use, as a term\r\nof reproach for those who insisted on an ultra-pure ritual, purged from\r\nall traces of the old religion. \"Puritan\" was used as \"Pharisee\" might\r\nhave been. [Footnote: Camden, Annals, year 1568.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1570 onward Puritanism entered upon a second stage, in the form of\r\na contest for changes in the organization of the established church. In\r\nthe main the same men who were dissatisfied with the liturgy of the\r\nchurch began to oppose the system of its government by bishops and\r\narchbishops. [Footnote: Letter from Sampson, formerly dean of Christ\r\nChurch, to Lord Burleigh, March 8, 1574, in Strype, Annals, III., 373.]\r\nThe \"Admonition to Parliament\" of 1572 declares that \"as the names of\r\narchbishops, archdeacons, lord bishops, chancellors, etc., are drawn\r\nout of the pope's shop, together with their offices, so the government\r\nwhich they use ... is anti-Christian and devilish and contrary to the\r\nScriptures. And as safely may we, by the warrant of God's words,\r\nsubscribe to allow the dominion of the pope universally to rule over\r\nthe word of God as an archbishop over a whole province or a lord bishop\r\nover a diocese which containeth many shires and parishes. For the\r\ndominion that they exercise ... is unlawful and expressly forbidden by\r\nthe word of God.\" [Footnote: Prothero, Statutes and Constitutional\r\nDocuments, 199.]\r\n\r\nThe greater number of those who attacked the episcopal organization of\r\nthe church advocated the system of Presbyterianism which had been\r\nextensively adopted on the Continent and recently introduced into\r\nScotland by the Book of Discipline. November 20, 1572, was erected at\r\nWandsworth, in Surrey, the first presbytery in England; [Footnote:\r\nBancroft, Dangerous Positions, chap, i., quoted in Prothero, Statutes\r\nand Constitutional Documents, 247.] from this time forward presbyteries\r\nwere established here and there by groups of neighboring parishes. Some\r\nten or fifteen years later the larger group, known as the \"classis,\"\r\nwas introduced; provincial and national \"synods\" were contemplated by\r\nmany of the Puritan clergy; and the English church bade fair to be\r\nreorganized on Presbyterian lines, without the authority of the law.\r\n\r\nThis action met the stern opposition of the queen and the Court of High\r\nCommission. In 1583 Elizabeth appointed Whitgift archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, and under him the law was enforced with rigor. Individual\r\nclergymen were deposed or forced to conform; the devotional practices\r\ncalled \"exercises,\" on which Puritanism throve, were forbidden; and\r\nalthough the contest continued, the introduction of Presbyterianism was\r\nheld in check.\r\n\r\nThe latter years of Elizabeth's reign saw Puritanism within the church\r\ntaking on a new activity, by turning from questions of ceremony and\r\nchurch government to questions of morals. The Puritans always stood for\r\ngreater earnestness and for the abolition of abuses in the church, but\r\nas time passed on they brought into greater prominence the ascetic\r\nideal of life; the strict keeping of the Sabbath borrowed from the\r\nJewish ritual became customary; [Footnote: Eggleston, Beginners of a\r\nNation, 123-132.] prevailing immoralities and extravagances were more\r\nbitterly reprobated in books, sermons, and parliamentary statutes; and\r\nPuritanism took on that unlovely aspect of exaggerated austerity which\r\ncharacterized its most conspicuous manifestations in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe great body of men of Puritan tendencies, both clergymen and laymen,\r\nwere deeply interested in reforming the church of England in liturgy,\r\nin organization, and in practices; but they had no wish or intention to\r\nbreak it up, to divide it into different bodies, or to withdraw\r\nindividually from its membership. They were as completely dominated by\r\nthe ideal of a single united national church, one in doctrine,\r\norganization, and form of worship, as was the queen herself.\r\nNevertheless, a group of men arose among them, under the general name\r\nof Independents, to whom the very idea of a national church seemed\r\nidolatrous; who found in the Scriptures, or were driven by the logic of\r\ntheir position, to one plan of church government only--the absolute\r\nindependence of each congregation of Christian believers. They looked\r\nback to the little groups of chosen believers in Syria and Asia Minor,\r\nthe shadowy outlines of whose organization are found in the New\r\nTestament; their imagination gave definite shape and their reverence\r\nfor the Scriptures gave divine authority to these as examples.\r\nAccording to the analogy of biblical times, they looked upon themselves\r\nas a remnant of saints, sacred and set apart from a wicked and\r\npersecuting world.\r\n\r\nSome of these extreme Puritans were under the influence of Robert\r\nBrowne, a zealous advocate, whose activity lay principally between 1581\r\nand 1586. Others came under the somewhat more systematic teachings of\r\nBarrow and Greenwood. Thus it became a fundamental principle of several\r\nthousand persons, between 1580 and 1600, to separate themselves from\r\nthe established church. They are, therefore, known as \"Separatists,\"\r\nthough they were more commonly called at that time, as a term of\r\nreproach, by the names of their leaders, \"Brownists\" or \"Barrowists.\"\r\nThey met in \"conventicles,\" and even strove to form more permanent\r\ncongregations by gathering in secret places, or sometimes openly, in\r\ndefiance of the authorities. A churchman of the time says that they\r\nteach \"that the worship of the English church is flat idolatry; that we\r\nadmit into our church persons unsanctified; that our preachers have no\r\nlawful calling; that our government is ungodly; that no bishop or\r\npreacher preacheth Christ sincerely and truly; that the people of every\r\nparish ought to choose their bishop, and that every elder, though he be\r\nno doctor nor pastor, is a bishop.\" [Footnote: Paule, Life of Whitgift\r\n(1612), 43, quoted in Prothero, Statutes and Constitutional Documents,\r\n223.]\r\n\r\nIn times when church and state were one, such teaching could not be\r\nendured. If the Puritans were scourged with whips the Separatists were\r\nlashed with scorpions. Their teachers were silenced and imprisoned, and\r\nBarrow and Greenwood were, in 1587, hanged at Tyburn. Their\r\ncongregations were broken up and attendants at their conventicles were\r\nfined, deprived of their property, and thrown into prison, where they\r\ndied by the score. Before Elizabeth's reign was over, the Separatists\r\nhad gone into exile or become but a persecuted remnant, so far, at\r\nleast, as outward manifestation extended; though one can scarcely doubt\r\nthat among Puritans generally, and even, perhaps, among those who still\r\nadhered to the established church, were many who shared their\r\nconvictions. It is to be remembered that the Independents and all the\r\nnew sects which were formed in England later in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, as well as the Puritans of New England, organized themselves\r\non the basis of independent congregations of Christian believers.\r\n\r\nThe close of the sixteenth century saw the contrast between the\r\nAnglican churchman on the one hand and the Puritan and Separatist on\r\nthe other becoming more harsh, their incompatibility more evident.\r\nFifty years earlier episcopacy and ceremonialism seemed to most\r\nAnglicans comparatively unimportant in themselves. They rather blamed\r\nthe Puritans for making a difficulty about matters indifferent, and for\r\nopposing the civil authority in things pertaining to conscience; but\r\ndid not quarrel with them on religious questions. But a generation of\r\ndisputes, the development of fundamental principles, the need for\r\njustification of a position already taken, drove both parties into a\r\nmore dogmatic attitude. The high-church party in the established church\r\nnow began to assert the divine appointment of the episcopal office, to\r\nlay stress on the doctrine of the apostolic succession, and gradually\r\nto reintroduce much symbolic ceremonial.\r\n\r\nThe Puritans, on the other hand, were more than ever convinced that the\r\nsystem they advanced was based upon divine authority; and that the\r\nchurch as it stood was founded upon human regulation only and must be\r\nforced, if it could not be persuaded, to change its system. Still\r\ngreater clearness was given to this division of parties by the\r\ntheological contest that came into existence between 1600 and 1620. The\r\nPuritans were almost completely Calvinist, and they claimed that the\r\nestablished church itself had always been so. On the other hand, the\r\nAnglican leaders of the early seventeenth century were Arminian, and\r\nthis form of theological doctrine was asserted by all those who\r\ndefended the existing organization and ceremonial practices of the\r\nchurch. [Footnote: Makower, Constitutional History of the Church of\r\nEngland, 75.] Thus the breach between the Puritan and the churchman was\r\nnow so wide that James I., indolent and arrogant for all his toleration\r\nand learning, did nothing--perhaps could do nothing--towards its\r\nclosing. He said of the Puritans, at the Conference at Hampton Court in\r\n1604: \"I shall make them conform themselves or I will harry them out of\r\nthis land, or else do worse.\" [Footnote: Gardiner, Hist, of England,\r\nI., 157.] He disappointed and angered them, drove them into opposition\r\nto his civil rule as well as to his church policy, and strengthened\r\ntheir number and their position by his treatment of Parliament, whose\r\ninterests and theirs had come to be inseparable.\r\n\r\nAll the \"antagonisms, religious and political,\" of the reign of James\r\nwere intensified in that of Charles I. The new king was more autocratic\r\nand more unsympathetic with his subjects; Parliament was more self-\r\nassertive and more determined to impose its wishes upon king and\r\nministers; the authorities of the established church were more\r\nintolerant towards the Puritans and milder towards the Catholics. The\r\nPuritans, on the other hand, were more convinced that the Anglican\r\nchurch was retrograding towards Catholicism, and more determined to\r\ndestroy episcopacy if they should ever be able to do so.\r\n\r\nThe freest opportunity of the established church to destroy Puritanism\r\ncame during the period of the personal government of Charles, from 1629\r\nto 1640, when Parliament had no meetings, and when the Court of Star\r\nChamber, the High Commission, and the Privy Council were the all-\r\npowerful instruments of an administration sympathetic with the high-\r\nchurch party. The oppressions of the Puritans were now at their height,\r\nand the prospect of ever obtaining freedom to worship as they chose\r\nseemed the darkest. With the most prominent liberal and Puritan leaders\r\nimprisoned for their political opinions, like Sir John Eliot, or lying\r\nin prison, crushed under enormous fines, like Prynne; with the courts\r\nsubservient to the royal will; with court preachers declaring the duty\r\nof passive obedience to the government; with Laud guiding the policy of\r\nthe king in all ecclesiastical matters,--the state of the Puritans\r\nmight well seem hopeless, and they might well look towards some distant\r\nland as a place for the establishment of a purified national church.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Laud typified and embodied the spirit of the dominant\r\nchurch, and in addition he had unwearied energy, industry, and\r\ndetermination. Sincere, practical, and brave, but narrow-minded and\r\nunsympathetic, he set about the work of reducing the church of England\r\nto absolute uniformity in accordance with the law as he interpreted it.\r\nThe Nonconformists had no rest; Puritan clergymen must conform; Puritan\r\nlaymen must suffer under the power of the church, which, dominated by\r\nits bishops and wedded to its idols, was becoming steadily more\r\npowerful and all-inclusive. The reign of Charles was not marked by the\r\npassage of harsher laws against the Puritans, but it was distinguished\r\nfrom all periods that preceded or followed it by the continuous,\r\nsteady, and thorough-going application of those already in existence.\r\n\r\nIt was under this regime that the great Puritan migration to America\r\ntook place. The Puritans represented a class of society which was much\r\nmore ready to emigrate than the Catholics. As early as 1597 some\r\nimprisoned Brownists sent a petition to the Privy Council asking that\r\nthey might be allowed to settle in America; and four men of the same\r\npersuasion even went on a voyage to examine the land. [Footnote:\r\nEggleston, Beginners of a Nation, 167.] In 1608 many Puritans seem to\r\nhave prepared to emigrate to Virginia, when by Archbishop Bancroft's\r\ninfluence they were forbidden by the king to go, except with his\r\nexpress permission in each individual case. [Footnote: Stith, Hist, of\r\nVirginia, book II., year 1608.]\r\n\r\nThe Separatists early became wanderers on the face of the earth, a now\r\nfamous group of them leaving their English homes for Amsterdam,\r\nmigrating thence to Leyden, and then, after hesitating between a Dutch\r\nand an English colony and between North and South America, a portion\r\nsettling themselves on Plymouth Harbor. [Footnote: Griffis, Pilgrims in\r\nTheir Three Homes.] In all the history of early colonization there have\r\nbeen few such occasions as that of the year 1638, when fourteen ships\r\nbound for New England lay in the Thames at one time, and when three\r\nthousand settlers reached Boston within the same year. [Footnote:\r\nAuthorities quoted in Eggleston, The Beginners of a Nation, 344] Almost\r\nall the Englishmen who were ever to emigrate to New England left their\r\nhomes during the twelve years between 1628 and 1640. Unfavorable\r\neconomic conditions at home and the prospect of greater prosperity in\r\nthe colony doubtless had their influence; but of the more than twenty\r\nthousand who passed from the old England to New England during that\r\ntime, it is fair to presume that by far the greater number were more or\r\nless influenced by their Puritan opinions.\r\n\r\nThe most decisive proof of this motive for emigration is the slacking\r\nof the tide of Puritan expatriation after 1640. When Parliament, after\r\neleven years of intermission, met in that year at Westminster in the\r\nfull appreciation of its power, one of its first actions was to order\r\nthe impeachment and arrest of Archbishop Laud. At last the Puritans had\r\ntheir turn, and the assembling of Parliament found them no longer a\r\nscattered, disorganized, diversified element in the English church and\r\nnation; but, thanks to long persecution, a compact body, austere in\r\nmorals, dogmatic in religious belief, ready to make use of political\r\nmeans for religious ends, and determined to impose their asceticism and\r\ntheir orthodoxy on the English people so far as they might be able.\r\n[Footnote: Eggleston, Beginners of a Nation, 133.]\r\n\r\nA majority of Parliament, small but sufficient, were Puritans, as had\r\nprobably been true of every Parliament for many years, had they been\r\nfree to act. Their intentions showed themselves in a prompt inception\r\nof reforms in the church, and the burdens of official ecclesiastical\r\noppression were rapidly transferred to the shoulders of those who had\r\npreviously bound the loads upon Puritan backs. In 1641 orders were\r\nissued by the House of Commons for the demolition of all images,\r\naltars, and crucifixes. [Footnote: Commons Journals, II., 279.] A\r\ncommission known as the \"Committee of Scandalous Ministers\" was\r\nappointed, and proceeded to discipline the clergy and to harass the\r\nuniversities. Demands for the harsher treatment of priests and Jesuits\r\nwere soon followed by plans for the diminution of the power of\r\narchbishops and bishops of the established church. The Court of High\r\nCommission was abolished July 5, 1641. [Footnote: 16 Chas. I., chap.\r\nii.] The archbishops and bishops were removed from the House of Lords\r\nand the Privy Council by the act of February 13, 1642. [Footnote:\r\nIbid., chap, xxvii.]\r\n\r\nThe Solemn League and Covenant of September 25, 1643, pledged\r\nParliament and the leaders of the now dominant party to extirpate\r\n\"church government by archbishops, bishops, their chancellors and\r\ncommissaries, deans, deans and chapters, archdeacons, and all other\r\necclesiastical officers depending on that hierarchy\"; and to reform\r\nreligion in England \"in doctrine, worship, discipline, and government,\r\naccording to the word of God and the example of the best reformed\r\nchurches.\" [Footnote: League and Covenant, Sub Section 1, 2.]\r\n\r\nBy this time the quarrel between Charles and Parliament had been put to\r\nthe arbitrament of the sword, and the distinction of Cavalier and\r\nRoundhead to a certain extent superseded that between Anglican and\r\nPuritan. In 1645 came the catastrophe of Naseby, then the long series\r\nof futile negotiations ending in the execution of the king at Whitehall\r\nin 1649. From the general confusion emerged the commonwealth, \"without\r\nany king or House of Lords,\" the church organized on Presbyterian\r\nlines, the spirit of Puritanism dominating, although there was\r\ntoleration for every form of Christian belief, \"provided this liberty\r\nbe not extended to popery or prelacy.\" [Footnote: Instrument of\r\nGovernment, Section 37.] For full twenty years the Anglican church was\r\nunder a cloud, first Presbyterianism and then Independency being the\r\nofficial form of the church of England. The ill-fortunes of the\r\nroyalist party in the civil war and under the commonwealth, and the\r\nreligious oppression imposed by the Puritans upon churchmen, now\r\ncombined to send to the colonies the very classes which had so recently\r\nbeen the persecutors. From 1640 to 1660 Virginia, Maryland, and the\r\nCarolinas received an influx of English churchmen escaping from\r\nconditions at home as intolerable to them as, those which drove the\r\nPilgrims and Puritans to New England during the previous decades.\r\n\r\nThe commonwealth was not merely a triumph of Puritanism, it was a\r\nbirth-time of new religious sects. The excitement of a period of civil\r\nwar, the breaking down of old standards, the disappearance of old\r\nauthority, the opportunities offered by the quasi-democracy of the\r\ncommonwealth, the preoccupation of the seventeenth-century mind with\r\nquestions of religion, all combined to cause almost a complete\r\ndisintegration of religious organization. Here and there a man began to\r\npreach religious truth and duty as they looked to him; he obtained\r\nadherents, a congregation was organized, the tenets of this body\r\nspread, and branches were formed; till shortly a new religious society\r\nhad come into existence, with its creed, organization, missionary\r\nspirit, and more or less vigorous hope of converting all men and\r\nabsorbing all other religious organizations. An almost indefinite\r\nnumber of such religious bodies arose during the middle years of the\r\nseventeenth century--Millenarians or Fifth Monarchy Men, Baptists or\r\nAnabaptists, Quakers, Ranters, Notionists, Familists, Perfectists, and\r\nothers. Most of them died out within the brief period which gave them\r\nbirth, but some survived to become great religious denominations,\r\nextending into America as well as throughout England. [Footnote: Gooch,\r\nEnglish Democratic Ideas in the Seventeenth Century, chap. viii.]\r\n\r\nOf these the Quakers are the most interesting in their relations to the\r\nNew World. The spirit from which they arose was closely similar to that\r\nwhich gave birth to the Baptists of England, the Anabaptists,\r\nMennonites, Pietists, and Quietists of the Continent. Their movement\r\nwas an extreme revolt against the formalism, corporate character, and\r\nexternality of established religion. It contained a deep element of\r\nmysticism. The Quakers declared all believers, irrespective of\r\nlearning, sex, or official appointment, to be priests. [Footnote: Fox,\r\nLetters, No. 249.] They asserted the adequacy of the \"inner light\" to\r\nguide every man in his faith and in his actions. They opposed all forms\r\nand ceremonies, even many of those of ordinary courtesy and fashion,\r\nsuch as removing the hat or conforming the garb to changing custom.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fox, the representative of these ideas, began his public\r\npreaching in 1648, and his doctrines at once found wide acceptance. In\r\n1652 there were said to be twenty-five Quaker preachers passing through\r\nthe country; by 1654 there were sixty, some of whom were women, who, by\r\nthe principles of their teachings, should preach as freely as men.\r\nTheir missionary journeys led them to Scotland and Ireland, and later\r\neven to Holland and Germany and the far east of Europe. Organization\r\namong the Quakers proceeded somewhat slowly. This was due partly to the\r\nindividualist character of their beliefs, partly to the lack of\r\nconstructive interest on the part of Fox and the other leaders during\r\nthe early period of their missionary work. Nevertheless, \"meetings\"\r\nwere gradually organized, took definite shape, and kept up regular\r\ncommunication with one another, so that there came to be a net-work of\r\nsuch bodies over the whole country. In 1659 it is estimated that there\r\nwere thirty thousand Quakers in England.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the religious liberty guaranteed by the Instrument of\r\nGovernment of 1653, the teachings and practices of the Quaker preachers\r\nbrought them into much turmoil. Their vituperation of the clergy, their\r\nintrusion into church services and ceremonies, already reduced only too\r\nfrequently to confusion by the rapid changes of the time, their\r\nobjection to the payment of tithes, their refusal to take an oath,\r\ntheir outspoken denunciation of all whose actions they disapproved, the\r\nprominence of women in their propaganda, and, in early times,\r\nsuspicions that they were connected with political plots, could not but\r\nsubject them to ridicule, abuse, and actual persecution. They\r\nhabitually violated numerous laws on the statute-book, ranging from\r\nthose requiring good order to those forbidding what was construed as\r\nblasphemy. They were, therefore, beaten and stoned by the mob; abused,\r\nfined, and imprisoned by the magistrates; ridiculed and prosecuted by\r\nthe clergy; subjected to starvation, exposure, and other hardships by\r\nsheriffs and jailers. [Footnote: Besse, Sufferings of the Quakers, I.,\r\nchaps, iii., iv, xi., xviii., II, chap. i., etc.]\r\n\r\nIn 1660 Charles II. was recalled to the throne. This event was a\r\nrestoration of the church even more than a restoration of the monarchy.\r\nThe royal power could never again be what it had been before the civil\r\nwar, the execution of a king, and the establishment of a republic. But\r\nthe church, with the longevity and recuperative power of all religious\r\norganizations, arose again to a life apparently as vigorous and\r\ndespotic as in the times of Laud. The year 1662 found four thousand two\r\nhundred Quakers in the jails of England; [Footnote: Sewel, Hist. of the\r\nQuakers, 346.] and the popular reaction against the austerity of the\r\nPuritan regime subjected Quakers to much ill-treatment by the rabble.\r\n\r\nYet just at this juncture the dignity of the body was strengthened and\r\nits power of self-assertion increased by the adherence to it of men of\r\nhigher education and social position. The Quakers of the commonwealth\r\nperiod were almost all of the middle and lower-middle or trading\r\nclasses. Soon after the Restoration a number of men of good family and\r\nsome means threw in their fortunes with the persecuted sect. One of\r\nthem, Robert Barclay, reduced to order and system the scattered and\r\nincoherent statements of its theology. In his Apology, published in\r\n1675, he set forth a logical and consistent statement of beliefs,\r\ncouched in clear and graceful language and supported by calm reasoning\r\nand example. [Footnote: Thomas, Hist. of the Society of Friends in\r\nAmerica, chap ii., 200, 201.] Of the same class was William Penn, an\r\neducated, wealthy, polished, and genial English gentleman. Yet he was\r\nalso a serious-minded and devout Quaker preacher, missionary, and\r\nwriter, and as he saw and shared in the sufferings of the faithful he\r\nmight well despair of better conditions in England and think of a \"Holy\r\nExperiment\" in America, where Quakers from 1675 onward were settling in\r\nWest New Jersey. [Footnote: Fiske, The Dutch and Quaker Colonies, II.,\r\n99, 167; Andrews, Colonial Self-Government, chap. vii.]\r\n\r\nUnder Charles II. the attitude of the king was favorable to the\r\nQuakers, while in the short reign of James II. they had the great\r\nadvantage of the personal friendship of the king for Penn. Yet no\r\nmatter what should be the favor of the king, or even their more\r\nmoderate treatment by the authorities of the established church,\r\nQuakers could not hope for material comfort or ease of mind in\r\nsurroundings so alien to their ideals as England was in the last\r\ndecades of the seventeenth century. They, still more than the Puritans\r\nin the time of Laud or the churchmen in the time of Cromwell, suffered\r\nbecause of the incongruity of the ordinary law and custom with their\r\nideals. It was the realization of this incompatibility, along with the\r\nattraction of a community under Quaker government, cheap and abundant\r\nland, a promise of a growing population and lucrative business\r\nopportunities that set flowing to Pennsylvania the tide of Quaker\r\nemigration and created in a few years a great Quaker commonwealth in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBesides Puritans, Anglicans, and Quakers, another great stream of\r\nemigration poured into the central colonies of America--the\r\nPresbyterian Scotch-Irish. To understand their coming, it is necessary\r\nto return to the early years of the seventeenth century and to consider\r\nthe policy of James I. towards rebellious Ireland. At the opening of,\r\nhis reign James found in Ireland an opportunity to plant a colony near\r\nhome. [Footnote: Walpole, Kingdom of Ireland, 130-135.] When Englishmen\r\nand Scotchmen had been established in Ireland, the Irish sore would be\r\nhealed, and that restless Catholic community be transformed into an\r\noutlying district of England. The \"Plantation of Ulster\" began in 1611.\r\nThe titles of the natives were ruthlessly forfeited, the six counties\r\nof the province of Ulster were re-divided, and the land was re-granted\r\nto proprietors who engaged to settle colonists from England and\r\nScotland upon it according to a fixed system.\r\n\r\nThis system was skilfully devised and rigidly carried out. It required\r\nthe new land-owners to establish freeholders, small tenants, laborers,\r\nand artisans upon the soil in proportion to the amount of land they\r\nreceived, allowing only a certain minimum number of the Irish natives\r\nto be retained as laborers. The proprietors were largely merchants of\r\nLondon and merchandising noblemen of the court; the tenants they\r\nintroduced were mostly from the towns and country districts of the\r\nnorth of England and the lowlands of Scotland. Men of Puritan\r\ntendencies showed the same readiness to emigrate to Ireland that they\r\nshowed soon afterwards as to New England, and as a result the settlers\r\nof Ulster, during the first two decades of the seventeenth century,\r\nwere almost universally Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nUnder these new and somewhat anomalous conditions a population grew up\r\nin the north of Ireland which was almost as distinct in race and\r\nreligious organization from the people of England and Scotland as it\r\nwas from the Catholic and Celtic population which it had displaced. Its\r\nreligion, without being proscribed, was not acknowledged, for\r\nAnglicanism was the established church of Ireland, though it numbered\r\nbut few adherents. Ulster's industrial interests were, from the\r\nbeginning, subordinated to those of England, as completely as were\r\nthose of the natives. [Footnote: Cunningham, Growth of English Industry\r\nand Commerce, II., 136.] As the century progressed the economic evils\r\nunder which the Scotch-Irish suffered became more pronounced. The\r\nnavigation acts were so interpreted as to exclude Ireland from all\r\ntheir advantages and to cut her off from any direct trade with the\r\ncolonies. Tobacco-growing was forbidden, and the exportation of cattle\r\nto England placed under prohibitory duties. The wool manufacture was\r\ncrushed by heavy export taxes, and the linen manufacture neglected or\r\ndiscouraged. In 1642 and again in 1689 came war and new conquests of\r\nthe country, to add to its disorganization and chronic sufferings.\r\nKidnapping, enforced service in the colonies, and traffic in political\r\nprisoners were indulged in by the government. Ireland, as a dwelling-\r\nplace for Catholics or Protestants, for Celts or Saxons, for natives or\r\nEnglish and Scotch settlers, was a country of ever-renewed distress.\r\n\r\nTo economic disabilities is to be added religious persecution of a mild\r\ntype, especially after 1689. All the laws that interfered with the\r\nreligious equality of the Presbyterians in England were extended to\r\nIreland; and they seemed more vexatious there because in Ulster the\r\nPresbyterians were in the vast majority and the established church\r\nalmost unrepresented, except by tithe collectors and absentee\r\nlandlords. At the close of the seventeenth century there were more than\r\na million Ulster Presbyterians. But soon, as a result of this combined\r\neconomic and religious oppression, they began to migrate in a narrow\r\nstream which by 1720 became a wide river. They formed the largest body\r\nof emigrants that left Europe for the American colonies. Before the\r\neighteenth century was over the Presbyterian population of Ireland was\r\nreduced by at least a half; [Footnote: Fiske, The Dutch and Quaker\r\nColonies in America, II., 354.] and the missing moiety was to be found\r\nscattered along the whole line of the Appalachian mountain-chain, at\r\nthe backbone of the English colonies, extending eastward and westward\r\nand forming a prolific and influential element of the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND (1500-1689)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn earlier chapter of this work has been devoted to the political\r\ninstitutions of Spain, France, and the Netherlands, and each had its\r\nshare of influence on American history; but it is England from which\r\nthe American nation really sprang, of which it was for more than a\r\ncentury and a half a dependency, and to whose traditions, institutions,\r\nand government we must look back for the origins of our own. The oldest\r\npolitical institution in England is the monarchy. Older than\r\nParliament, older than the law-courts, older than the division of the\r\ncountry into shires, the monarchy dates back to the consolidation of\r\nthe petty Anglo-Saxon states in the ninth century--and these were\r\nthemselves kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAt no time in this long course of English history were the claims of\r\nthe monarchy more exorbitant than under James I. and Charles I., from\r\n1603 to 1642, just when the tide of immigration began to flow towards\r\nAmerica, and when the governments of the colonies were being\r\nestablished. \"What God hath joined, then, let no man separate. I am the\r\nhusband and all the whole isle is my lawful wife. I am the head and it\r\nis my body. I am the shepherd and it is my flock. . . .\" [Footnote:\r\nProthero, Select Statutes, 283.] So King James wove metaphors, when he\r\naddressed Parliament at its opening in 1604. When disputes had arisen\r\nin 1610 he declared: \"The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon\r\nearth, for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth and sit upon\r\nGod's throne, but even by God himself they are called gods. ... As to\r\ndispute what God may do is blasphemy, ... so is it sedition in subjects\r\nto dispute what a king may do in the height of his power.\" \"Encroach\r\nnot upon the prerogative of the crown; if there falls out a question\r\nthat concerns my prerogative or mystery of state, deal not with it till\r\nyou consult with the king or his council, or both, for they are\r\ntranscendent matters.\" [Footnote: Ibid., 293, 294.]\r\n\r\nThis absolute prerogative of the king was attributed to him by others,\r\nas well as claimed by himself. Dr. Cowell, professor of civil law at\r\nCambridge, declared that the king \"is above the law by his absolute\r\npower\"; [Footnote: Cowell, Interpreter, under word \"king.\"] and Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh wrote that attempts to bind the king by law justified\r\nhis breach of it, \"his charters and other instruments being no other\r\nthan the surviving witnesses of unconstrained will.\" [Footnote:\r\nRaleigh, Prerogative of Parliament, Preface.] But this definition of\r\nthe prerogative of the king was an exaggerated description of his real\r\nposition in the English system of government, and was either academic\r\nor argumentative. As properly used, absolute monarchy merely meant an\r\nall-powerful not an autocratic government; government was supreme, but\r\nthe king was not necessarily supreme in the government. As government\r\nhad been developed in England, in the course of time it had grown up\r\naround the monarchy as its centre and found in it its embodiment.\r\n\r\nIn Anglo-Saxon England government was crude and embryonic, but even\r\nthen the king held a general oversight over the exercise of its few\r\nfunctions. In the later Middle Ages, when government was somewhat more\r\nhighly developed, its more numerous functions, in so far as they were\r\nnot performed by feudal lords or church officials, were fulfilled by\r\nthe king. It was by the monarchy that the law-courts were formed and\r\ncommissioned, that Parliament was summoned and given the opportunity\r\nfor self-development, that the system of taxation and of military life\r\nwas organized. The great advance in the organization and effectiveness\r\nof government which marked the reigns of the Tudor rulers consisted in\r\nthe elaboration and increased activity of the administrative or royal\r\nelement in the government.\r\n\r\nThe royal prerogative might, therefore, be conceived of as the function\r\nof keeping the machine of government running. The king was the director\r\nand controller of an aggregate of governmental powers. All officials\r\nwere commissioned in his name, and those of higher rank were actually\r\nselected and appointed by him. All foreign intercourse was carried on\r\nin his name, and in the main directed by him; Parliament was called,\r\nprorogued, and adjourned at his will, and he kept at least a negative\r\ncontrol over its actions. All justice, was exercised in his name, and\r\nhis interests and known wishes sometimes influenced decisions. All\r\ncharters, whether to cities, to guilds, to possessors of mercantile\r\nmonopolies, or to commercial and colonizing companies, were issued\r\nunder his name and seal, and the powers granted in them could not be in\r\nopposition to his will. [Footnote: Smith, The Commonwealth of England,\r\nbook I., chap, ix., book II., chap. iv.]\r\n\r\nThe powers of the king were, therefore, very real, even if the\r\nphilosophic contentions of James and other theorists be disregarded;\r\nbut they were powers restricted in every direction by actual\r\nconditions, and exercised through ministers whose familiarity with\r\nprecedent, whose control over the details of administration, whose\r\ndignified offices, and whose personal weight of judgment and character\r\nmade them, though nominally servants of the king, a real power in the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMuch of the royal power was exercised through the three great law-\r\ncourts, King's Bench, Exchequer, and Common Pleas; through the courts\r\nof equity, held by the chancellor, the master of the rolls, and the\r\nmaster of requests; through the half-administrative, half-judicial\r\nbodies, the council of the north and the council of the marches of\r\nWales, and through the circuit courts of assize. Much was exercised\r\nthrough higher and lower administrative officers, through the\r\nExchequer, and through lower offices such as the wardrobe and the\r\nadmiralty.\r\n\r\nBut the real centre of gravity of the executive powers of the\r\ngovernment at this time is to be found in the Council or Privy Council,\r\ntwo terms which are used indiscriminately. [Footnote: Dicey, The Privy\r\nCouncil, 80] This body was made up of seventeen or eighteen members,\r\nincluding all the great ministers of state, the lord chancellor, or, as\r\nhe was sometimes called, lord keeper of the great seal, the high\r\ntreasurer, the two secretaries, the great master and the comptroller of\r\nthe household, the chamberlain and the great admiral, besides a certain\r\nnumber chosen as members of the Privy Council without otherwise\r\noccupying office. [Footnote: Acts of the Privy Council, 1594-1597]\r\nThere were usually from six to ten members of the council present, the\r\nmembership of some of the ministers being somewhat perfunctory.\r\n\r\nAs a body, however, its services were as far from perfunctory as can\r\nwell be conceived. Its sessions were held almost daily and its sphere\r\nof activity was apparently coextensive with the life of England and of\r\nall its dependencies. Scarcely an interest, public or private, escapes\r\nits attention, whether it is the organization of a campaign in France\r\nor the settlement of a family quarrel between father and son;\r\n[Footnote: Acts of the Privy Council, 1591-1592, pp 160, 193, 256-258,\r\n292, 327, 414, 476, etc.] whether it is \"Sir John Norreis, knight, and\r\nThomas Diggs, esquire,\" or a Lord Morley, or the chief baron of the\r\nCourt of Exchequer, Lord Manwood, or some merchants or poor artisans or\r\nan \"Elice Gailer, of Berton, yeoman,\" that appear before the council at\r\nits summons; whether it is engaged in formulating rules for articles\r\ncontraband of war, or trying to put an end to illicit coinage on the\r\nborders of Wales; whether engaged in one or other of a hundred\r\ndifferent interests, the council is always active, intrusive, and high-\r\nhanded. [Footnote: Ibid, 231, 305, 314, 378, 449, 572.] It regulated\r\nmanufactures and trade, protected foreigners, disciplined recusants,\r\nkept the oversight of customs and other officials, settled disputes\r\nbetween colleges and their tenants, bishops, deans, and government\r\nofficers, instructed sheriffs and justices of the peace as to their\r\nduty, made provision for the keeping up of military and naval forces,\r\nand performed other duties so numerous and varied as to defy\r\nenumeration or classification.\r\n\r\nA special duty of the Privy Council was to keep up correspondence with\r\nthe officials of outlying districts under the dominion of the crown and\r\nnot within the systematic administration of sheriffs, assize courts,\r\njustices of the peace, or other regular governance. These regions\r\nincluded the marches of Wales and of Scotland, certain counties of\r\nEngland, Ireland, and the Channel Islands, the last two of these having\r\nbeen placed under the direct supervision of the Privy Council by\r\nstatute. [Footnote: Poynings's Act (1495), Dicey, The Privy Council,\r\n90.] As colonies grew up they fell, naturally, under the special care\r\nof the Privy Council. The duty of hearing appeals from colonial courts\r\nbecame and is still a duty of the council; to the Privy Council were\r\nreferred colonial laws for approval or veto; and the successive bodies\r\nformed for the oversight of the colonies, culminating in the Board of\r\nTrade and Plantations of 1696, were either committees of the Privy\r\nCouncil or boards acting under its control and reporting to it.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of this control over the colonies was still far in the\r\nfuture, the power exercised by the council over England's nearest\r\ndependency, Ireland, may fairly be taken as anticipatory of it. Irish\r\nmatters during the later years of Queen Elizabeth and the early years\r\nof James I. demanded much attention and time from the Privy Council,\r\nnotwithstanding the existence of an Irish Parliament, a lord deputy,\r\nvarious provincial officials, and the whole framework of a subordinate\r\ngovernment in Ireland. All the variety of cases that came before the\r\ncouncil from England were duplicated from Ireland. In fact, Ireland was\r\ntreated much as if it were an English county, or better, perhaps, one\r\nof those regions of England, like the marches of Wales, which had a\r\nsomewhat peculiar jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe most important form of oversight of Ireland exercised by the Privy\r\nCouncil was that based upon \"Poynings's Act\" of 1495. Sir Edward\r\nPoynings, a type of that class of vigorous officials of middle rank\r\nwhich were such useful instruments of the Tudor government, was sent,\r\nin 1494, to Ireland as lord deputy; the next year he called a\r\nparliament at Drogheda and obtained its assent to a number of statutes\r\ndesigned to introduce order into that disturbed country, and to make\r\nreal the power of English government by diminishing that of the\r\nturbulent lords of the Pale. [Footnote: Morris, Hist. of Ireland, 1496-\r\n1868, pp. 58-63.] As a means of reaching the latter object, the Irish\r\nParliament, which had long been under their control and which had\r\nlately made some assertion of its right of independent action,\r\n[Footnote: Irish Statutes, 37 Henry VI.] was to be curbed, and that by\r\nits own ordinance.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore enacted that in the future no bill should be\r\nintroduced into the Irish Parliament unless its heads had first been\r\nsubmitted to the English Privy Council and obtained the approval of\r\nthat body and of the king. [Footnote: Irish Statutes, 10 Henry VII.,\r\nchap. iv.] Moreover, this approval must be given before Parliament met.\r\nThis reduced the Irish Parliament to a mere registering body for royal\r\nenactments. In 1556 an explanatory act was passed [Footnote: Irish\r\nStatutes, 3 and 4 Philip and Mary, chap. iv.] amending Poynings's Act\r\nso far as to make it allowable for the Irish Parliament to pass any\r\nbills which had received the approval of the crown and of the English\r\nPrivy Council at any time during its session. The regular practice of\r\nIrish legislation under these acts was as follows: any member of either\r\nhouse of the Irish Parliament might bring in heads of a bill, which, if\r\napproved by both houses, were submitted to the viceroy, who referred\r\nthem to the Irish Privy Council; that body sent them, altered or\r\nunaltered, to the king, who referred them to the English Privy Council;\r\nthis body then approved, rejected, or modified them; and they were\r\nreturned, through the viceroy, to the Irish Parliament in the form of a\r\nbill, to be accepted or rejected as a whole, but not to be further\r\nmodified. [Footnote: Walpole, Kingdom of Ireland, 253, 254.]\r\n\r\nBy this cumbrous method only could the Irish Parliament legislate. It\r\nwas, moreover, subject not only to the English Privy Council, but to\r\nthe English Parliament. One of the clauses of Poynings's Act had\r\nprovided that all statutes which up to that time had been passed by the\r\nEnglish Parliament should bind Ireland also. [Footnote: Irish Statutes,\r\n10 Henry VII., chap. xxii.] Many laws were subsequently passed by the\r\nEnglish Parliament for Ireland, thus ignoring the Irish Parliament; but\r\nit was not till later than the period we are considering that a claim\r\nof the superiority of the English Parliament was definitely made. In\r\nthe eighteenth century a member of the Irish Parliament published a\r\nbook called The Case of Ireland Being Bound by Acts of Parliament in\r\nEngland Stated. This was formally condemned by the English Parliament\r\nand ordered to be burned by the common hangman. [Footnote: Walpole,\r\nKingdom of Ireland, 252.] When still later the Irish House of Lords\r\nprotested against the reversal of one of its judgments, on appeal, by\r\nthe English House of Lords, the English Parliament, in 1720, passed an\r\nact depriving the Irish House of Lords of any appellate jurisdiction,\r\nand declaring that \"the English Parliament had, hath, and of right\r\nought to have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of\r\nsufficient force and validity to bind the people of Ireland\" [Footnote:\r\n6 George I., chap, v.]--a precedent of portentous applicability to the\r\nAmerican colonies when a similar question came up in regard to them a\r\nhalf-century later. The power of Parliament over external dependencies\r\nwas destined to come into greater prominence in the future. The\r\nquestion at issue at the beginning of the seventeenth century was the\r\nextent of its power over England itself. Was it, like the Privy\r\nCouncil, the law-courts, and other such bodies, merely a creation and\r\ndependency of the crown? Or was it, although in form an assembly of\r\nroyal councillors, meeting only when the king summoned it and ceasing\r\nto exist when he ordered its dissolution, a branch of the government\r\nco-ordinate with or even in certain relations superior to him?\r\n\r\nIn the organization of Parliament there were several grave\r\ndeficiencies, if it were to be considered an independent body. It was a\r\ncomposite assembly of two ill-related parts. The House of Lords, which\r\nconsisted at this time of some fifty members, [Footnote: D'Ewes,\r\nJournals, 599] had an existence as a royal council quite apart from the\r\nHouse of Commons, and there were still many evidences that it was the\r\noriginal body and the House of Commons a later accretion. In 1601, when\r\nElizabeth appeared in the House of Lords to open her last Parliament,\r\nthe Commons, who were waiting in their own chamber, did not hear of her\r\npresence promptly, and when they hastened to the Lords' chamber the\r\ndoor was closed and they could not obtain admission, so they \"returned\r\nback again into their own House much discontented.\" [Footnote: Ibid,\r\n620.] The Lords had various privileges and constitutional rights of\r\ntheir own: as individuals, of trial by peers, of being represented by\r\nproxies, of entering individual protests, of audience with the\r\nsovereign, of certain advantages of procedure in the courts of common\r\nlaw; as a body, of trying impeachments brought by the House of Commons,\r\nand of acting as a final court of appeal for all lower courts whether\r\nof law or equity. [Footnote: Pike, Constitutional History of the House\r\nof Lords, chaps. ix., xi.-xiv.]\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was composed of two knights or gentlemen elected\r\nfor each shire; and one or two representatives for each of nearly three\r\nhundred cities and boroughs. The system of representation was crude and\r\nantiquated. The knights of the shire were elected by the \"forty-\r\nshilling freeholders\"--that is to say, by all who had a tenure\r\napproaching ownership in lands whose annual rental value reached that\r\nsum. This was an electorate that reached far down in the social scale,\r\nbut it was limited by the tendency of English land to remain in the\r\nhands of large owners, and by the influence, legitimate and\r\nillegitimate, of the gentry, the great county noble families, and the\r\ncrown. The knights of the shire, therefore, as a matter of fact, not\r\nonly belonged to, but were elected by and reflected the interests and\r\nfeelings of, the great body of rural gentry; while the yeomen exercised\r\nlittle influence in Parliament, as the laboring classes certainly\r\nexercised none at all.\r\n\r\nThere were vast differences in the system of election by the towns\r\nwhich were represented in Parliament, varying all the way from\r\nappointment by patrons, in some towns, down through divers grades of\r\nextension of the franchise to an almost universal suffrage in a few.\r\nNevertheless, from the towns, as from the counties, it was\r\nrepresentatives of the upper and middle classes that sat in the\r\nCommons. There was no approach to equality in the constituencies\r\nrepresented in the House of Commons; members were elected often by\r\noutside influence and always by a narrow constituency, and no control\r\nwas possessed by the electors over their representatives.\r\n\r\nYet these defects were more apparent than real. The special powers of\r\nthe House of Lords were becoming shadowy, and almost the only real\r\nsignificance of the peerage was when it was united with the House of\r\nCommons and made a part of the larger whole of Parliament. [Footnote:\r\n36 and 37 Henry VIII., f. 60 (Dyer, Reports, pt. i, 327).]\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons was the real source of power of Parliament.\r\nWhatever the imperfections in the method of election, whatever the\r\nirregularity of constituencies, whatever the crudity of the idea of\r\nrepresentation, the five hundred or more knights, country gentlemen,\r\nlawyers, and merchants who made up the Commons at this time [Footnote:\r\nNames of Members Returned to Serve in Parliament, pt. i., 442-448.]\r\nwere convinced that in some way they stood for the whole nation. When\r\nParliament had been once summoned and organized, it became a body with\r\nthree hundred years of precedent back of it; and in the days of the\r\nStuarts it confronted the king with claims to a very different position\r\nand power from those he was inclined to concede to it. So far from\r\nassimilating their position to that of the law-courts, Privy Council,\r\nand other such bodies, at the very opening of the reign of James the\r\nCommons declared \"there is not the highest standing court in this land\r\nthat ought to enter into competency either for dignity or authority\r\nwith this high court of Parliament which with your Majesty's royal\r\nassent gives laws to other courts, but from other courts receives\r\nneither laws nor orders.\" [Footnote: Apology of the Commons, 1604;\r\nPetyt, Jus Parliamentarium, 227-247.]\r\n\r\nThe course of time intensified this difference of opinion. \"Set chairs\r\nfor the ambassadors,\" James cried, mockingly, when the deputies from\r\nthe House of Commons visited him with a petition during the dispute of\r\n1621. To the king Parliament seemed to be making a claim to sovereignty\r\nagainst which the only proper argument was a jest. Shortly afterwards\r\nhe wrote to the speaker of the House of Commons, \"These are, therefore,\r\nto command you to make known in our name unto the House that none\r\ntherein shall presume henceforth to meddle with anything concerning our\r\ngovernment or deep matters of state.\" He insisted that \"these are unfit\r\nthings to be handled in Parliament except your king requires it of you.\r\n\"As to the privileges of Parliament James wrote, \"We cannot allow\r\nof the style calling it your ancient and undoubted right and\r\ninheritance, but could rather have wished that ye had said that your\r\nprivileges were derived from the grace and permission of our ancestors\r\nand us.\" [Footnote: Letter of the king to the House of Commons,\r\nDecember 10,1621.]\r\n\r\nThe Commons, on the other hand, a week later, placed this protestation\r\non their minutes: \"That the liberties, privileges, and jurisdictions of\r\nParliament are the ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of\r\nthe subjects of England, and that the arduous and urgent affairs\r\nconcerning the king, state, and defence of the realm, and of the church\r\nof England and the maintenance and making of laws, and redress of\r\nmischiefs and grievances which daily happen within this realm, are\r\nproper subjects and matters of counsel and debate in Parliament; and\r\nthat in the handling and proceeding of those businesses every member of\r\nthe House of Parliament hath and of right ought to have freedom of\r\nspeech to propound, treat, reason, and bring to conclusion the same.\"\r\n[Footnote: Rushworth, Historical Collections, I., 53.] It is true that\r\nJames sent for the Journal and tore this page from its records, but he\r\ncould not tear the belief in its statements from the hearts of a great\r\npart of the people of England.\r\n\r\nKing and Parliament held diametrically opposite views of their relative\r\npowers, and both appealed to the past in justification of their\r\nopinions. But England's past was a long story, and its successive\r\nchapters read very variously. James appealed to the immediate past to\r\njustify his possession of the \"inseparable rights and prerogatives\r\nannexed to our imperial crown, whereof, not only in the times of other\r\nour progenitors, but in the blessed reign of our late predecessor, that\r\nrenowned queen Elizabeth, we found our crown actually possessed.\"\r\n[Footnote: King's proclamation on dissolving Parliament, January\r\n6,1622.] The leaders of the House of Commons, on the other hand, were\r\nlooking back to a more remote past, the birth-time and period of\r\nacknowledgment by the crown of the parliamentary privileges and English\r\nliberties which now seemed to them endangered.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Parliament, like all other political institutions\r\nin England, had grown up around the monarchy. Primarily, the Houses\r\nwere a body of advisers of the king, summoned by him to give their\r\ncounsel in matters in which he needed the advice of the various classes\r\nof his subjects; and to give their consent to taxation, which would\r\nrequire sacrifice on the part of the people. Once organized, however,\r\nParliament gathered into itself all the shadowy survivals of self-\r\ngovernment coming down from a still earlier period; it reflected the\r\nlocal independence of the towns and counties which sent members to the\r\nHouse of Commons, and the corporate rights of the church and individual\r\nprivileges of the nobility, which constituted its upper house; it\r\nserved as the instrument by which the nation at various times protected\r\nitself against bad government; it embodied the fifteenth-century ideal\r\nof a government conjointly by king and estates of the realm.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Parliament gained by repeated use and acknowledgment an\r\nestablished procedure and powers, well-understood rights, and\r\nprecedents frequently invoked. The four fundamental privileges of\r\nmembers of Parliament were: (1) freedom of elections: (2) freedom from\r\narrest during the sessions; (3) freedom of speech in debate; (4)\r\nfreedom of access to the sovereign for their speaker, if not for all\r\nindividually. These were frequently acknowledged by the sovereign at\r\nthe opening of Parliament and enrolled upon its records, and still more\r\nfrequently asserted in the House. [Footnote: D'Ewes, Journals, 65, 66,\r\n175, 236, 259, 411, 460, etc; Petyt, Jus Parliamentarium, 227-243,\r\nquoted in Prothero, Select Statutes, 289; Commons Journals, I., 431,\r\netc.] The powers of Parliament were less clearly defined than its\r\nprivileges; but its control over taxation and legislation, its right to\r\nimpeach the king's ministers and to discuss all matters of interest to\r\nthe nation, were frequently asserted, and usually conceded. [Footnote:\r\nGneist, Hist. of the English Constitution, chaps. v., xxxii.] Thus\r\nParliament was much more than a royal council; it was a body with\r\nclaims to co-ordinate powers of government. How far, at any one time,\r\nthese privileges and powers were conceded, how far they were denied or\r\nencroached upon by the crown, was largely dependent on circumstances.\r\nThese circumstances during Tudor times had been such as to put the\r\ninitiative and much of the actual power of government in the hands of\r\nthe king, and parliamentary powers were largely in abeyance. Parliament\r\nduring this time was a conservative body; the monarchy was the\r\ninnovating element of the state.\r\n\r\nCircumstances changed with the closing years of the sixteenth century\r\nand favored an increase of parliamentary participation in government.\r\nWith all her prestige the old queen herself had to feel it. [Footnote:\r\nD'Ewes, Journals, 602.] With the accession of the half-foreign Stuarts,\r\nwith the cessation of danger of invasion from abroad, with the\r\nincreasing weight of exactions of an unwise and unpopular personal\r\ngovernment, with the growing interest of the seventeenth century in\r\nmatters of politics, and, above all, with the development of\r\nPuritanism, individualistic and self-assertive in its very essence,\r\nParliament was sure to reassert all the powers which it had ever\r\npossessed, and likely to seek to extend them. The king was now the\r\nconservative element, while Parliament, if recent conditions be taken\r\nas the standard, was the innovating party.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly at this period of contest and of unsettled balance of\r\npowers that the early settlements were made in America. The colonists\r\nrepresented almost without exception what might be called the\r\nparliamentarian view. It was not the king, the--courtiers, the nobles,\r\nthe judges, the higher clergy, the official classes, and the fellows of\r\nthe universities that emigrated. Among these the royalist spirit was\r\nstrong, but they remained in England. It was rather from the middle and\r\nlower classes, from those who were on poor terms with the king,\r\nwhatever their position in society, from the persecuted, the\r\ndissatisfied, the restless, that the great body of colonists was drawn;\r\nand among these classes the views upheld by the House of Commons were\r\nwide-spread. The same thing was true of those companies which,\r\nremaining in England, yet had so much influence over the destinies of\r\nthe American colonies. The most influential elements in the Virginia\r\nCompany, the Massachusetts Bay Company, and other similar bodies were\r\ndistinctly opposed to the high claims of the king. Yet unanimity did\r\nnot exist even among those who, left England; and strong as the\r\npredilection was among the founders of America for self-government and\r\nrepresentative institutions, the Old-World differences of view were\r\ntransferred to the colonies and played a part in local struggles there.\r\n\r\nMuch of the disputation between James and the House of Commons\r\nconcerned the privileges of Parliament, and might be suspected of being\r\nlargely the natural jealousy of its own rights felt and asserted by an\r\nancient corporation. But Parliament was waging war for larger objects\r\nthan the rights of its own body; it felt itself to be defending in its\r\nown privileges the personal rights of all Englishmen. In the contested\r\nelection case of 1604 a member declared that \"the case of Sir John\r\nFortescue and Sir Francis Goodwin has become the case of the whole\r\nkingdom.\" [Footnote: Commons Journals, I, 159, March 30, 1604] \"The\r\nrights and liberties of your subjects of England and the privileges of\r\nthis House,\" is a formula that appears frequently in the documents of\r\nthe time, and combines the two objects of the contest, in which the\r\nlatter were upheld largely because they supported and protected the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nThese ancient rights of the people were less definite than either the\r\nprivileges or the powers of Parliament. They were, perhaps, attractive\r\nand valued somewhat in proportion to their vagueness. They certainly\r\nincluded right of freedom from arrest or imprisonment except on a\r\ndefinite charge and by due process of law; they included exemption from\r\ntaxation except after consent of Parliament, [Footnote: Hakewell's\r\nargument in the Bates case of 1610 (State Trials, ed 1779, XI);\r\nPetition of Right of 1628] they included protection against violence\r\nand injustice; they included the right of petition to the king against\r\nany grievance, [Footnote: Coke's speech on Petition of Right\r\n(Parliamentary History, VIII., 104). VOL 1--19] and in general a right\r\nto have the laws enforced, yet to have nothing done to their\r\ndisadvantage which was not in the law. It was the spirit rather than\r\nthe letter of Magna Carta that was valued by the English people. As\r\ntime passed and under Charles I. the conflict between the parliamentary\r\nand the royal claims became more intense, the upholders of the former\r\nfell back more and more on the ancient rights and liberties of the\r\npeople, and relatively less is said of parliamentary privileges. In the\r\nPetition of Right of 1629, Parliament appeals to the Great Charter, to\r\nthe Confirmation of the Charters, and to other early statements of\r\npersonal liberties. Pym declared that \"the liberties of this House are\r\ninferior to the liberties of this kingdom.\" When the civil war was\r\nactually imminent, in December, 1641, the Grand Remonstrance was issued\r\nas a statement of the contentions of the leaders in Parliament. In this\r\ndocument \"the people,\" \"the liberties of subjects,\" \"rights of the\r\nnation,\" and other popular expressions are constantly used or implied.\r\n[Footnote: Grand Remonstrance, SS 11, 19, 28, 40, 53, 57, 98, 130,\r\netc., in Rushworth, Historical Collections, IV., 438.]\r\n\r\nUltimately, as a result of the struggles of the later years of the\r\nseventeenth century, the more important of such rights were formulated\r\nin the Bill of Rights of 1689. Thus the heritage of civil freedom which\r\nthe people of England had traditionally enjoyed was neither taken from\r\nthem by the strong monarchy of the sixteenth century nor forgotten in\r\nthe struggle of Parliament for its own privileges in the seventeenth.\r\nIt was reasserted with constantly new insistence in England, and was\r\ncarried to America by the colonists as an acknowledged and valued\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH COUNTY AND ITS OFFICERS (1600-1650)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Englishman in the seventeenth century had much more to do\r\nwith local than with national government. Only a few score men served\r\nthe king as ministers, councillors, or judges; only a few hundred\r\nattended Parliament; while as lords lieutenant, sheriffs, justices of\r\nthe peace, constables, church-wardens, mayors, aldermen, and in other\r\ncapacities of local and limited but real power, many thousands must\r\nhave taken a part in public affairs. National government was remote\r\nfrom the ordinary man; local government came close to him. The\r\npolitical institutions which surrounded him on all sides, insensibly\r\ncontrolling every action and forming the world to which his outward\r\nlife conformed, were familiar to him and affected his habits and ideas,\r\nwhether he remained at home or emigrated to the colonies, far more\r\ndirectly than did the political institutions of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe oldest, most stable, and most important unit of local government\r\nwas the shire, or county. The conspicuous official and historic head of\r\nthe county was the sheriff. As Camden says, \"Every year some one of the\r\ngentlemen inhabitants is made ruler of the county wherein he dwelleth.\"\r\n[Footnote: Camden, Britannia (ed. 1637), 160.] Though no longer\r\nrelatively so powerful as in the Middle Ages, his position was even yet\r\none of much dignity and importance. On occasions of public ceremony he\r\nhad an imposing personal retinue, carried a white rod of office, and\r\nwore official robes. [Footnote: King, The Vale-Royall, 40; North,\r\nExamen, quoted in Dict. Nat. Biog., XII., 121.] Richard Evelyn, when\r\nsheriff, \"had one hundred and sixteen servants in liverys, every one\r\nliveryed in greene sattin doubliets; divers gentlemen and persons of\r\nquality waited on him in the same garbe and habit.\" [Footnote: Evelyn,\r\nDiary, 1634.] William Ffarrington, sheriff of Lancashire in 1636, kept\r\nup the following household: a steward, a clerk of the kitchen, two\r\nyeomen of the plate cupboard, a yeoman of the wine-cellar, two\r\nattendants on the sheriff's chamber, an usher of the hall, two\r\nchamberlains, four butlers and butler's assistants, eight cooks, five\r\nscullions, a porter, a baker, a caterer, a slaughterman, a poulterer,\r\ntwo watchmen for the horses, two men to attend the docket door each day\r\nby turns, twenty men to attend upon the prisoners each day by turns--\r\naltogether a household of fifty-six servants. [Footnote: The Shrievalty\r\nof William Ffarrington, 17 (Chetham Society). This reference and a\r\nnumber of those which follow I owe to the industry and good scholarship\r\nof Mr. Charles Burrows, a young man of great promise, who, after\r\nstudying at the universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania, and beginning\r\nthe preparation of a thesis on the Subject of this chapter, went abroad\r\nfor further study and died in 1902.] With the need for such official\r\noutlays, it is no wonder that a long series of statutes should have\r\nprovided that the sheriff should be one who had land in the county\r\n\"sufficient to answer king and people.\" [Footnote: 9 Ed. II., st. 2; 4\r\nEd. III., chap, ix.; 5 Ed. III., chaps, iv., xiii., xiv.] In fact, he\r\nwas usually a knight or a man of such rank as might be made a knight. A\r\nlist of the sheriffs of the county of Chester during the reigns of\r\nJames I. and Charles I. shows twenty-three knights and twenty-three\r\nwithout title, but presumably of equal rank in society. [Footnote:\r\nKing, The Vale-Royall, 233.] Many of the best-known men of this period,\r\nsuch as Sir Thomas Wentworth, Sir Ralph Verney, Sir William Selby, and\r\nSir Anthony Ashley Cooper, afterwards earl of Shaftesbury, acted at\r\nvarious times as sheriffs of their respective counties. They were\r\ndirect successors of Chaucer's Franklyn, of whom we are told, \"A\r\nschirreeve had he been.\" With some exceptions, such as those cities\r\nwhich had their own elective sheriffs, and those pairs of counties\r\nwhich were conjoined under one sheriff, each shire had one sheriff,\r\nappointed in the following manner: every year, on November 1, a special\r\nmeeting of the Privy Council was held at the exchequer, a number of the\r\nhigher government officials being especially required to be present;\r\nhere a list of three persons of distinction from each county, qualified\r\nto fill the office of sheriff, was made up and submitted to the king,\r\nwho \"pricked\" one from each three; the men thus chosen were then bound\r\nto seek letters-patent, and take their oaths as sheriffs for the\r\nensuing year in their respective counties. [Footnote: Fortescue, De\r\nLaudibus Legum Angliae, chap. xxiv.] By law the same man could not be\r\nappointed for two successive years. [Footnote: 14 Ed. III., chap, vii.,\r\netc.] This was probably a welcome restriction, as the appointees bore\r\nsomewhat unwillingly the burdens and expenditures of the office.\r\n[Footnote: Hist. MSS. Commission, Report VII., App., 3-9, 25.] In 1630\r\nwe find Sir Francis Coke writing to ask Sir J. Coke \"to keep my loving\r\nneighbour and friend Edward Revell of Brookhill from being sheriff this\r\nyear\";[Footnote: Ibid., Report XII., App. I., 414. ] and in 1663 Evelyn\r\nenters in his diary, \"To court to get Sir John Evelyn, of Godstone, off\r\nfrom being sheriff of Surrey.\" [Footnote: November 6, 1663.] It is true\r\nthat the office brought with it many small fees. A long list of\r\ncustomary payments for the issue of various writs and the performance\r\nof various services by the sheriff is given in the manuals of the time.\r\n[Footnote: Greenwood, The County Court, 183.] On the other hand, the\r\nfees payable by the sheriff to the officials of the exchequer on his\r\nappointment and discharge, [Footnote: Ibid., 122.] the expenses of his\r\noffice, and the requirements of his position for social expenditure\r\nwere very considerable, and the comment of a contemporary law-writer\r\nwas, no doubt, in most cases, justified: \"But the sheriff is at much\r\nmore charge, which is laid out and is disbursed during his sheriffwick,\r\nas experience will inform him.\"[Footnote: Greenwood, The County Court,\r\n187.] Another burden of the sheriff's office was enforced residence in\r\nhis own county during his term of service. The records are overspread\r\nwith fines for the violation of this requirement and with requests for\r\ndispensations from conformity to it.[Footnote: Hist. MSS. Commission,\r\nReport VII., App., 5; Rushworth, Historical Collections, II., App., 27,\r\nDeputy Keeper of the Public Records, Reports, XLIII.,151; Cal. of State\r\nPap., Dom., 1628-1629, pp., 396, 403, etc.] A personage in an old play\r\nsays of the ladies of his time, \"I think they would rather marry a\r\nLondon jailer than a high-sheriff of a county, since neither can stir\r\nfrom his employment.\" [Footnote: Wycherly, The Country Wife, act iv.,\r\nsc. 1.] The title high-sheriff, frequently used instead of the simple\r\nterm sheriff, had no especial significance and was probably suggested\r\nby a desire to discriminate him from the under-sheriff. The exacting\r\nduties of the office led the sheriff very frequently to appoint, at his\r\nown cost, such a subordinate and to empower him to perform such\r\nservices as could be legally transferred to another. He was usually a\r\nman of some position, \"learned somewhat in the law, especially if the\r\nsheriff be not learned himselfe.\" [Footnote: Smith, Commonwealth of\r\nEngland, book II., chap. xvii.] He was a source of considerable expense\r\nto his superior, an estimate of annual cost made in 1628 amounting to\r\n352 Pounds 18s. 6d. He relieved the sheriff, however, of his more\r\nonerous and invidious duties. North declared that \"Clifford and\r\nShaftesbury looked like high-sheriff and under-sheriff. The former held\r\nthe white staff and had his name to all returns, but all the business,\r\nespecially the knavish part, was done by the latter.\" [Footnote:\r\nExamen, 8, quoted in Dict. Nat, Biog., XII., 113.]\r\n\r\nThe duties of the sheriff were many and varied; some of them old\r\njudicial and administrative functions, others new and irregular\r\nservices demanded of him by the innovating Tudor and Stuart sovereigns.\r\nEvery month he must hold a county court, at which were brought suits\r\nfor debts of less than forty shillings, suits for damages, for breach\r\nof contract, for non-payment of wages, for not returning borrowed or\r\npledged articles, and a hundred other petty causes. [Footnote:\r\nFitzherbert, Natura Brevium, 28 d, etc.] In this court also, and at\r\nsome other times and places, he must proclaim certain ancient statutes\r\nand new laws and ordinances for the information and warning of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe county court as a judicial body was, in the seventeenth century, a\r\nwaning institution, its competence and functions becoming rapidly\r\nobsolete; but occasionally it awakened suddenly to life, took on a new\r\naspect, and became of unwonted importance. This occurred when a summons\r\nwas issued for a new parliament, for the county court was the electing\r\nbody of the knights of the shire, and to the next session after the\r\nwrits for the parliament had been issued came the gentry and\r\nfreeholders of the county to elect their representatives. [Footnote:\r\nDalton, Officium Vicecomitum, chap. xcii.] There was often a great\r\nconcourse and much excitement, and the petty disputes of poor suitors\r\nand the labors of obscure officials were for the time completely\r\nsuperseded. The sheriff, as presiding official at this election, as the\r\nreturning officer of the elected members, and as the official charged\r\nwith levying money for the payment of their wages and expenses, had an\r\nactive and influential connection with the choice of members of\r\nParliament. A long series of statutes checked the abuses connected with\r\nthis influence; but even yet the sheriff exercised some power over the\r\nselection made, especially when he was a man of large influence in his\r\ncounty apart from his office.[Footnote: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nThere was great irregularity in the process of election. Sometimes the\r\nmembers were elected by acclamation, sometimes by show of hands,\r\nsometimes by a poll, one voter after another expressing orally his\r\npreference. The election should, by law, be held between eight and\r\neleven o'clock in the morning, but a sheriff sometimes postponed the\r\nelection, or refused to acknowledge the candidate insisted on by the\r\nelectors, or threw out votes which he claimed were not properly given,\r\nor closed the election when his preferred candidate was in an\r\nadvantageous position. The journals of the House of Commons are filled\r\nwith reports of contested elections, and sheriffs are repeatedly found\r\nkneeling at the bar of the House to receive censure or pardon for such\r\noffences.[Footnote: Commons Journals, I., 511, 556, 801, 854, 884,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\nA period of scarcely less responsibility for the sheriff was the semi-\r\nannual assizes, when the judges in their robes, on their circuit, with\r\nall the dignity of the judicial representatives of the crown, visited\r\nthe county.[Footnote: Rushworth, Historical Collections, I., 294.] It\r\nwas the duty of the sheriff to see that grand and petty juries were\r\nready to perform the services required of them by these judges, and to\r\ncarry out the mandates and judgments of the court. These judgments,\r\nwhich he had to execute either in person or by his under-sheriff or\r\nbailiffs, varied in character from the serving of writs or levying upon\r\nproperty for debt to the infliction of the death penalty. [Footnote:\r\nGreenwood, 133; Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum Angliae, chap xxiv.] The\r\nsheriff had also the supervision of the jail and the appointment of\r\njailers. His presence at the two assizes of the year was considered one\r\nof his most fundamental duties, and heavy fines were imposed when\r\noccasionally a sheriff was absent from his post at that time.\r\n[Footnote: Rushworth, Historical Collections, II., App., 27; Cal. of\r\nState Pap., Dom, 1628-1629, p. 396.] He not only met the judges with\r\nhis retinue and furnished them a guard, but feasted them and acted as a\r\nsort of local host to the circuit court so long as it was in session in\r\nhis county.\r\n\r\nClosely analogous to this duty of the sheriff was the requirement that\r\nhe should be present, provide jurymen, and carry out the behests of the\r\njustices of the peace at their quarter-sessions; but the justices were,\r\nlike himself, local officers belonging to the county, not visitors from\r\nthe capital, so that their sessions had little of the ceremony and\r\nexcitement of the assizes; and, in fact, the sheriff was usually\r\nrepresented there by the under-sheriff acting as his deputy. [Footnote:\r\nLister, Two Earliest Sessions Rolls of West Riding of Yorkshire, 1597-\r\n1602, III., 28, 44, 64, etc.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these and many less conspicuous regular duties the\r\nsheriff in the early seventeenth century was utilized from time to time\r\nby the central government in irregular and somewhat questionable\r\nservices. When James revived the distraint of knighthood it was the\r\nsheriffs who were required to make out lists of all who had 40 Pounds a\r\nyear of lands or rents and to order them to appear at court and receive\r\nknighthood. When Charles I. revived the imposition of ship-money it was\r\nto the sheriff of each county that the writ was sent, stating the\r\namount to be paid by his county and ordering him to arrange with the\r\nlower officials for its assessment and collection.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic resistance of Hampden found a parallel in the passive\r\nopposition of some of the sheriffs to this demand upon them. On June\r\n30, 1640, the King's Council wrote to the sheriff of Huntingdonshire:\r\n\"We have read and considered of your letter of the 24th of the present,\r\nwherein we perceive that you have been rather industrious to represent\r\nthe difficulties which, as you say, you find in the execution of his\r\nmajesty's writ, than circumspect or careful, as you ought to have been,\r\nin overcoming and removing them,... and we cannot but make this\r\njudgment upon your proceedings, that instead of doing your duty in\r\nperson and compelling others subordinate to you to do theirs, you\r\nendeavor to make excuses both for yourself and them.\" [Footnote:\r\nRushworth, Historical Collections, I, 1203.]\r\n\r\nAlongside of the sheriff at the head of the shire was another officer,\r\nthe lord-lieutenant, whose position, although but recently attained,\r\nwas in some ways more conspicuous and in certain exigencies more\r\npowerful than his. No statute or other formal action provided for the\r\noriginal creation of the lord-lieutenancy, and it is probable that\r\nHenry VIII. simply began the habit of delegating his military power in\r\nthe shires to such officers. Early in the reign of Edward VI., October,\r\n1549, they are mentioned as existing in the counties, and by 1600 their\r\noffice was fully established.[Footnote: 3 and 4 Ed VI, chap v, in\r\nStatutes of the Realm, IV, 107.]This position was usually held by the\r\ngreatest nobleman with estates in the county, and he appointed as his\r\ndeputies various knights and gentlemen of high position; as when, in\r\n1626, the duke of Buckingham was lord-lieutenant of Bucks, and Sir\r\nEdward Verney and five others were his deputies in that county.\r\nAlthough purely honorary, the appointment was one of much dignity and\r\nresponsibility in military matters.\r\n\r\nIt was the duty of the lord-lieutenant in times of peace to see that\r\nthe musters of the trained bands were regularly held, that the militia-\r\nmen had their arms, and that men of higher rank who owed military\r\nservice to the crown were prepared to perform it; in time of war to\r\nlevy, muster, and train soldiers, fix the quotas of the hundreds and\r\ntownships, see to the payment of troops, the collection of horses, and\r\nequipment generally, until the recruits were actually handed over to\r\ntheir officers. It was also their duty to see that the beacons were\r\nkept in order. The lords-lieutenant must be present, by an order of\r\n1615, nine months in the year [Footnote: Cal. of State Pap., Dom.,\r\n1611-1618, p. 337.] in their counties; but there was no such rigorous\r\nrequirement of constant residence as in the case of the sheriff, nor\r\nwas the appointment restricted to a single year.\r\n\r\nSuch an official as the lord-lieutenant was not likely to be left\r\nunburdened with other duties when the government was struggling to\r\nobtain the enforcement of its laws, and, as a matter of fact, functions\r\nquite unmilitary were imposed upon him. In 1637 the council orders the\r\nlords-lieutenant of six of the eastern counties to assist in the better\r\nenforcement of the acts for the drainage of the marshes. [Footnote:\r\nCal. of State Pap., Dom., 1637, p. 92.] In 1621 they are to investigate\r\nfrauds of his majesty's carters. [Footnote: Hist. MSS. Commission,\r\nReport VII., App., 670.] They are asked to help collect subsidies and\r\nbenevolences, to search for popish recusants, to oversee ale-houses,\r\nslaughter-houses, and the assize of bread and ale, to assist in the\r\nadministration of poor relief and the suppression of vagrancy.\r\n[Footnote: Chetham Society, Lancashire Lieutenancy, I, Int., 19; Camden\r\nSociety, Verney Papers, 37, 88.] In 1619 the Lords of the Council write\r\nto the lieutenant of Surrey asking him to urge co-operation in a\r\nlottery for the success of \"the English colonies planted in Virginia,\r\nto accept the sums adventured, and to report to the treasurer and\r\ncouncil of Virginia.\" [Footnote: Hist. MSS. Commission, Report VII.,\r\nApp., 670.] Much less dignified in position than either the lord-\r\nlieutenant or the sheriff, and yet filling an old and important office,\r\nwas the coroner. He was elected by the freeholders of the county in the\r\ncounty court, and his oath was administered by the county clerk. He\r\nwas, therefore, more distinctly local and representative than the other\r\ncounty officers, who were appointed by the crown; and as a result he\r\nwas the only officer whose office did not terminate with the death of\r\nthe king. Notwithstanding the generality of duties indicated by his\r\nname, \"custos placitarum coronae,\" his functions were few beyond the\r\nfundamental duty of investigating sudden deaths and binding over for\r\ntrial such persons as were indicated by the jury through which he made\r\nhis inquest. [Footnote: Smith, Commonwealth of England, book II., chap.\r\nxxiv.] Under some circumstances the coroner took the place of the\r\nsheriff, and in general his position looked back to a time when it was\r\nof greater significance than it had become in the seventeenth century.\r\n[Footnote: Greenwood, The County Court, 258.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nENGLISH JUSTICES OF THE PEACE (1600-1650)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever extensive the duties of the officers whose functions are\r\ndescribed above, the real men-of-all-work in the counties at this time\r\nwere the justices of the peace. The law required that a justice of the\r\npeace must have lands and tenements to the value of L 20 a year, the\r\namount of the legal knight's fee; [Footnote: 18 Henry VI., chap. xi]\r\nbut ordinarily he had much greater property. John Evelyn's father, who\r\nhas been so often referred to as a typical country gentleman of the\r\nearly seventeenth century, had an estate of L 4000 a year when he was\r\nsuccessively sheriff and justice of the peace. [Footnote: Evelyn,\r\nDiary, year 1634] The justice of the peace, like the sheriff, the lord-\r\nlieutenant, and the coroner, was expected to perform his public\r\nservices as part of his patriotic duty. It is true that certain\r\nstatutes provided that part of the fines for any violation should go to\r\nthe justices before whom the violators were prosecuted; two or three\r\nothers gave small fees to the justice for affixing his seal or signing\r\na document; but these were apparently casual efforts to secure\r\nenforcement, and can have brought no appreciable return to the\r\njustices. The law gave each justice 2s. for each day of quarter-\r\nsessions up to three days; but this could have produced at most only\r\n6s., and seems to have been usually jointly expended by the magistrates\r\nin a dinner.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting speech by a Mr. Glascock in the House of Commons,\r\nDecember 16, 1601, two equally undesirable justices are described--\r\nfirst, the one \"who from base stock and lineage by his wealth is gotten\r\nto be within the commission\"; the other \"a gentleman born, virtuous,\r\ndiscreet, and wise, yet poor and needy. And so only for his virtues and\r\nqualities put into the commission. This man I hold unfit to be a\r\njustice, though I think him to be a good member in the commonwealth.\r\nBecause I hold this for a ground infallible--that no poor man ought to\r\nbe in authority. My reason is this: he will so bribe you and extort you\r\nthat the sweet scent of riches and gain taketh away and confoundeth the\r\ntrue taste of justice and equity.\" [Footnote: Townshend, Proceedings,\r\n953, 954] But burdensome as the duties of a justice must have been, and\r\nalmost unpaid as they were, the office does not seem to have been\r\navoided as was that of sheriff. Probably such service was taken as a\r\nmatter of course by the gentry, and compensation was found in the stamp\r\nof social position it placed upon them, and in the sense of power, as\r\nwell as of a patriotic fulfilment of duty. It was sometimes a matter of\r\ncomplaint that \"with us these magistrates have been so unsuitably\r\nappointed that a county justice is made a jest in comedies, and his\r\ncharacter the subject of buffoonery and laughter.\" [Footnote: Carey,\r\nEnglish Liberties, 275] This is an obvious reference to Justice Shallow\r\nand other worthies of the dramatists. It is dangerous to make too\r\nserious an inference from contemporary comedies, because certain\r\npersonages soon became stock characters and ceased to have any very\r\nclose relation to actual life, and in this particular instance\r\nShakespeare was probably gratifying an old grudge.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was evidently some foundation for this picture of\r\nthe county justice. Dorothy Osborne, in one of her delightful letters\r\nto Sir William Temple, in giving her requirements for a husband, pokes\r\nfun at such ambitions. \"He must not be so much of a country gentleman\r\nas to understand nothing but hawks and dogs, and be fonder of either\r\nthan his wife; nor of the next sort of them whose aim reaches no\r\nfurther than to be Justice of the Peace, and once in his life High\r\nSheriff, who reads no book but statutes, and studies nothing but how to\r\nmake a speech interlarded with Latin that may amaze his disagreeing\r\npoor neighbours, and fright them rather than persuade them into\r\nquietness.\" [Footnote: Letters of Dorothy Osborne to Sir William\r\nTemple, letter 36 (ed. by Parry), p 171] With all these criticisms, and\r\nin the face of occasional ineptitude, the body of justices of the peace\r\nincluded much ability. It was scarcely possible for a justice to act\r\nwithout some knowledge of Latin, as almost all the records and\r\ndocuments which he would have to make, read, or sign were in that\r\nlanguage. A succession of text-books on the duties of the office, the\r\nmore important of them appearing in many successive editions, proves an\r\nintelligent interest and demand for instruction in their duties.\r\nMoreover, the men who served as justices were often well known in other\r\nways, many of them as sheriffs, as members of Parliament, and in still\r\nother capacities. They were of families who provided the active men of\r\nenterprise of the period. The list of Devonshire justices in 1592\r\nincludes Sir Francis Drake, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Gilberts, Carews,\r\nSeymours, Courtenays, and other names prominent among the men who laid\r\nthe foundations of the maritime greatness of England and of the\r\nexistence of America. Of the fifty-five, twenty-eight were at one time\r\nor another high-sheriffs of the county, twenty more were then, or\r\nbecame afterwards, knights, six sat in the House of Commons, and three\r\nin the House of Lords. [Footnote: Hamilton, Devonshire Quarter-\r\nSessions, 3, 330-348.]\r\n\r\nThe justices of the peace were fair representatives of that great class\r\nof rural gentry which exercised so strong an influence over the\r\ndestinies of England in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth\r\ncenturies. From this class were drawn all the county officials who have\r\nbeen named, except the lord-lieutenant; from it were chosen the county\r\nrepresentatives to Parliament; and in it were found the strength and\r\nthe weakness of the English political system. James I., in appealing to\r\nthe country gentry to continue to live on their estates in their\r\ncounties, said to them, \"Gentlemen, at London you are like ships in a\r\nsea, which shew like nothing, but in your country villages you are like\r\nships in a river, which look like great things.\" [Footnote: Bacon,\r\nApothegms, in Works (Spedding and Heath ed), VII., 125.]\r\n\r\nOut of this body of rural gentry from twenty to sixty in each county\r\nwere chosen by the lord-chancellor to serve as justices of the peace.\r\n[Footnote: Lambard, Eirenarcha, book I., chap. v.] The \"commission of\r\nthe peace,\" by which the justices were appointed and from which they\r\ndrew their powers, was a formula well known and constantly quoted and\r\ncommented upon, and added to from time to time until late in the\r\nsixteenth century. In was then, in 1590, revised and formulated anew by\r\nSir Christopher May, Chief-Justice, with the advice of all the other\r\njudges of the time, and has not been changed from that day to this.\r\n[Footnote: Ibid., book II., chap. vii.]\r\n\r\nThe justices of the peace performed some of their duties separately,\r\nacting individually as circumstances required, or as proved convenient\r\nto themselves. Other powers they could exercise only when two or more\r\nacted together and concurrently. Still others, and those far the most\r\nimportant and dignified, they performed in a body at their \"quarter-\r\nsessions.\" What things a justice might do singly, what two, three, or\r\nfour justices might do together, and what they might do only in the\r\nformal sessions of the whole body of justices of the peace of the\r\ncounty were defined partly in the statutes, partly in the commission\r\nunder which they acted.\r\n\r\nThe regular or quarter-sessions were meetings held four times a year--\r\nin October, midwinter, spring, and midsummer--at which all the justices\r\nof the peace of the county were supposed to be present. There were,\r\nbesides, occasional irregular sessions, or meetings of the regular\r\nsessions adjourned from one time to another. In corporate towns the\r\ncity officers acted as justices of the peace, reinforced usually by\r\nsome others especially appointed; and each town followed its own\r\ncustoms as to meeting in general sessions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the law contemplated the attendance of all the justices of the\r\ncounty at each quarter-sessions, as a matter of fact the attendance was\r\nvery irregular and incomplete, few of the records, so far as published,\r\nshowing an attendance of as many as a dozen out of perhaps forty or\r\nfifty. Most of them evidently came riding up to quarter-sessions if it\r\nsuited their convenience and remained away if it did not, restricting\r\ntheir services to those duties which could be performed in their own\r\nneighborhoods, and leaving to a few active, regular, and hardworking\r\nmagistrates the responsibilities of the higher work. [Footnote: West\r\nRiding Sessions Rolls; Manchester Quarter-Sessions, passim.]\r\n\r\nOf those who made up quarter-sessions one at least must be \"of the\r\nquorum.\" This expression is taken from the commission of the justices\r\nof the peace, which in the clause giving to the justices the power to\r\ninquire and determine by oath of the jurors as to felonies and other\r\noffences and to punish them, after naming all those to whom the\r\ncommission for that county is issued, says, quorum aliquem vestrum, A,\r\nB, C, etc., unum esse volumus (of whom we wish you, A, B, C, etc., to\r\nbe one), naming presumably such as were learned in the law or otherwise\r\nespecially trustworthy. [Footnote: Lambarde, Eirenarcha, book I., chap.\r\nix.] As without the presence of one of the \"quorum\" no quarter-sessions\r\ncould be held, to be a \"justice of the peace and of the quorum\" was to\r\nbe one of a select list of the justices. One-third or one-half of the\r\nlist of those in the commission were usually named also in the quorum.\r\nIn addition to the justices there should, according to law, be present\r\nat quarter-sessions, in the first place, the custos rotulorum, or\r\nkeeper of the rolls of the sessions, the \"custalorum\" of Justice\r\nShallow. [Footnote: Merry Wives of Windsor, act i., sc. i.] This was\r\nalways one of the justices of high rank indicated to the lord-\r\nchancellor for appointment by the king himself, [Footnote: 37 Henry\r\nVIII., chap i.] and was very apt to be the lord-lieutenant of the\r\ncounty. He could be, and probably was, usually represented at the\r\nsessions by a deputy, who was a person of considerable importance and\r\ninfluence, upon whom much responsibility was placed by the statutes,\r\nand whose abilities must have been constantly relied upon by the\r\nmagistrates. The title of this deputy was \"clerk of the peace,\" the\r\npredecessor apparently of the American county clerk. He was usually\r\nfamiliar with the law, and his knowledge of precedents and procedure\r\nmust often have stood the unlearned justices in good stead, besides the\r\nwork which he performed in drawing up indictments, writing orders, and\r\nkeeping records.\r\n\r\nBesides the custos and the clerk, the sheriff or his deputy were bound\r\nto be present prepared to empanel jurors and execute process; as well\r\nas the jailer ready to produce his prisoners; the superintendent of the\r\ncounty house of correction; all jurors who had been summoned by the\r\nsheriff; all persons who had been bound over by single justices to\r\nappear at quarter-sessions; all high constables and bailiffs of\r\nhundreds; and the coroners. [Footnote: Dalton, Officium Vicecomitum,\r\nchaps, xxxiv., clxxxv.] The quarter-sessions should, by law, be kept\r\nfor three continuous days if there was any need; [Footnote: 12 Richard\r\nII, chap. x.] but, as a matter of fact, sessions seldom lasted more\r\nthan a day, and a contemporary complains that \"many doe scantly afford\r\nthem three whole hours, besides the time which is spent in calling of\r\nthe county and giving of the charge.\" [Footnote: Lambarde, Eirenarcha,\r\nbook IV., chap. xix.]\r\n\r\nThe powers and duties of the justices of the peace in quarter-sessions\r\nand separately were so considerable and varied as to tax the ability of\r\nan Elizabethan or Jacobean text-book writer to reduce them to\r\nsimplicity of statement, or to the compass of five or six hundred pages\r\nof enumeration. Many of these powers were general, arising from the\r\nnature of the office for the \"conservation of the peace\"; but the great\r\nmass of their duties was placed upon them by statutes. Ten early\r\nstatutes are enumerated in the commission itself, before coming to the\r\ninclusive \"and cause to be kept all other ordinances and statutes made\r\nfor the good of our peace and the quiet rule and government of our\r\npeople.\" From the middle of the fifteenth century forward, the\r\nenforcement of the greater number of new laws was placed primarily in\r\nthe hands of the justices of the peace.\r\n\r\nAs time passed on legislation became more and more minute and\r\ninclusive. Few interests in human life escaped the paternal attention\r\nof government under the Tudors and Stuarts, and this great mass of\r\nenactment it became the duty of the groups of country gentry in the\r\ncounties and of the civic magistrates of the towns to put into force. A\r\nwriter of the time enumerates two hundred and ninety-three statutes\r\npassed previous to 1603 in which justices of the peace are mentioned\r\nand given some jurisdiction or duties. [Footnote: Lambarde, Eirenarcha,\r\nbook IV., chap, xix., Table, App.] Under Elizabeth alone there were\r\nseventy-eight, ranging from the \"preservation of spawn and frie of\r\nfish\" to those \"touching bulls from Rome.\" The infrequent and short-\r\nlived parliaments of James I. added thirty-six to the list. [Footnote:\r\nDalton, The Country Justice, Table of Contents.]\r\n\r\nAlthough many of these laws are repetitions, some others temporary or\r\nlocal, still others insignificant, yet, on the other hand, some of them\r\nopened up whole new fields of activity to the justices: as, for\r\ninstance, those placing upon them, after 1563, the administration of\r\nthe Act of Apprentice; and, after 1581, the responsibility for the\r\nsearch for and punishment of popish recusants. A whole code of law,\r\nprocedure, and precedent grew up on these two subjects, besides others\r\nscarcely less extensive.\r\n\r\nQuarter-sessions had nothing to do with civil suits, and cases of\r\ntreason, murder, and certain other high crimes were excluded from their\r\ncompetence. Apart from this restriction and these offences, there was\r\nlittle difference between sessions and assizes, between the\r\njurisdiction of the learned judges of the king in their half-yearly\r\ncircuit and that of the county magistrates in their quarter-sessions.\r\nBefore them both grand and petty juries were empanelled, indictments\r\ndrawn up, prisoners tried for assault, burglary, horse-stealing,\r\nwitchcraft, pocket-picking, keeping up nuisances, cheating, failure to\r\nattend church, and almost all other offences of which seventeenth-\r\ncentury Englishmen were capable. If convicted they were placed in the\r\nstocks, whipped, or hanged. In Devonshire, in the midwinter sessions of\r\n1598, out of sixty-five culprits who were tried eight were hanged; at\r\nmidsummer, out of forty-five eight were hanged, thirteen flogged, seven\r\nacquitted, and seven, on account of their claim of benefit of clergy,\r\nwere branded and then released. [Footnote: Hamilton, Devonshire\r\nQuarter-Sessions, 33.]\r\n\r\nThe justices in sessions or singly also performed much administrative\r\nwork, such as the oversight and repair of bridges, the granting of\r\nlicenses to ale-houses, the establishment of wages, the binding out of\r\napprentices, and the relief of wounded soldiers. Many laws passed under\r\nElizabeth and James I. admitted of exceptions when approved by one or\r\nmore justices of the peace, and there was thus constant occasion for\r\ngranting to individual persons or at special times permission to export\r\ngrain, to turn their barley into malt, to build cottages without land\r\nattached, to carry hand-guns, to buy and sell out of market-hours, to\r\nbeg, and other dispensations from the rigorous application of the law.\r\n[Footnote: Ibid., 27, 164, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe punishing of recusants and the discipline of those who refused or\r\nneglected to go to church was, as already stated, an active occupation\r\nof the justices.\r\n\r\nAt certain times, such as the period just following the Gunpowder Plot,\r\nwhen the search was for Catholics, and somewhat later, when the search\r\nwas for Puritans and Separatists, the Privy Council brought severe\r\npressure upon the justices to fulfill these duties, and numerous\r\nprosecutions were brought by them. In Middlesex during the reign of\r\nJames I. the indictments averaged eighty-five per year for religious\r\noffences, and sometimes at one session there were as many as one\r\nhundred and fifty persons indicted. [Footnote: Middlesex County\r\nSessions Rolls, II., III.; Hamilton, Devonshire Quarter-Sessions, 27,\r\n74, etc.; Cal. of State Pap., Dom., 1633-1634, p. 531.]\r\n\r\nThe justices were constantly called upon to act in special emergencies\r\nor to give special relief. If a man's thatched cottage were burned, the\r\nnearest justice might authorize him to make an appeal to his neighbors\r\nfor help to rebuild; if a whole village or town suffered from a more\r\nextensive fire, the justices in their sessions quartered the homeless\r\npeople in various parishes, announced a subscription, and, calling\r\nconstables and leading villagers before them, exhorted them to liberal\r\nvoluntary gifts, and appointed a subcommittee to administer the funds\r\nfor relief; if a pestilence appeared, a tax-rate for immediate\r\nassistance was levied, and the justices supported the sick and enforced\r\nthe quarantine; if food became scarce and high-priced the justices\r\nforbade its export from the county or conversion into malt, and even\r\nannounced a maximum market-price for it. When weavers or other\r\nartificers were out of work the justices set to work to induce masters\r\nto employ them or merchants to buy their goods, or, as a last resort,\r\nlevied a rate for their support. If news came of the capture of a\r\nnumber of English sailors or merchants by Barbary pirates, collections\r\nwere taken up by the justices of the maritime counties for their\r\nredemption. In all such exigencies it was the justices of the peace who\r\nwere expected to tide over the special temporary difficulty or need.\r\n\r\nBesides the ancient regulative duties of the justices, and besides\r\nthose that were definitely given them by successive statutes, they were\r\nconstantly subject to the commands and instructions of the Privy\r\nCouncil. In 1592, soon after the remodelling of the commission, a\r\ncircular letter was sent by the Privy Council to certain commissioners\r\nin each county requiring them to call a special meeting of all justices\r\nof the peace, at which the oath of office and the oath of supremacy\r\nmust be taken by each, or they must retire from the commission of the\r\npeace. [Footnote: Hamilton, Devonshire Quarter-Sessions, 36, 48;\r\nNichols, Hist. of the Poor Law, 252; Hist. MSS. Commission, Report\r\nXIV., App. IV., 42.] This seems to have been preparatory to a more\r\nstrict discipline and oversight of their actions, for communications\r\nfrom the council now became more frequent and more drastic. In\r\nrequiring them to fulfil their duties as magistrates the Privy Council\r\nspoke categorically in the name of the king in a constant series of\r\nletters, couched often in such harsh terms of reproof as to make it\r\nhard to realize that the justices were gentlemen of rank and dignity,\r\nfulfilling laborious services practically without compensation. In 1598\r\nvigorous letters were sent to the various counties calling the\r\nattention of the justices to the recently enacted poor law, and\r\nrequiring them to see it put into execution. [Footnote: Leonard, \"the\r\nPoor Law,\" 143.] From this time forward to the outbreak of the civil\r\nwar the pressure of the council on the justices became stronger and\r\nstronger. In January, 1631, a \"Book of Orders\" was issued by the Privy\r\nCouncil giving instructions in greater detail to the justices as to\r\ntheir duties, especially in regard to the poor law, and requiring them\r\nto make reports every three months to the sheriffs, who were to\r\ntransmit these reports to the justices of assize, who were in turn to\r\nsend them to certain members of the Privy Council deputed for the\r\npurpose. The judges of assize were also to report directly to the king\r\nif they learned of the negligence of any of the justices of the peace.\r\n[Footnote: Ibid., 158, etc.] \"The Book of Orders\" was reissued from\r\ntime to time and its requirements followed up.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made by these means to introduce a system of \"thorough\"\r\nin the affairs of local government during the period of the personal\r\ngovernment of Charles I., analogous to that attempted in the higher\r\nranges of government by Wentworth, Laud, and their fellow-members of\r\nthe Privy Council. The great instruments of this plan were the justices\r\nof the peace, acting within the limits of their respective counties,\r\ncarrying out the manifold duties imposed upon them by law, under\r\nconstant pressure from the Privy Council and the king. After even this\r\npartial enumeration of the services of the justices of the peace and of\r\nthe supervision kept over them, one can readily appreciate the feeling\r\nof the justices of Nottingham who complained that they had \"little rest\r\nat home or abroad.\" [Footnote: \"Cal. of State Pap, Dom,\" 1631-1633, p.\r\n18.]\r\n\r\nThe centre of gravity of local government in England was in the county.\r\nThe power which put its machinery in motion was that of the central\r\ngovernment; but the actual administration was in the hands of the\r\nsheriff, the lord-lieutenant, the coroner, and the justices of the\r\npeace. The county bounded the sphere of activity of all these\r\nofficials. The commission of any group of justices named the county in\r\nwhich they were to exercise their functions, and outside of its\r\nboundaries all their powers dropped from them. The coroner could not\r\nhold an inquest outside of his own county, and even the lord-lieutenant\r\ncould exercise his military functions only within the shire or shires\r\nnamed in his commission. When, in 1603, James I. rode southward from\r\nEdinburgh on the news of the death of Elizabeth, and crossed the border\r\nat Berwick, he was met by the sheriff of Northumberland and escorted by\r\nhim to the borders of Durham, where he was met by the sheriff of that\r\ncounty, and so from shire to shire through the whole length of England\r\ntill he reached London.\r\n\r\nThe basis of representation in Parliament was the county: the counties\r\nformed the districts for all the circuit courts; national taxation was\r\nlargely distributed by counties, and, as has been seen, local\r\njurisdiction and administration were largely in the hands of county\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nENGLISH PARISH OR TOWNSHIP GOVERNMENT (1500-1650)\r\n\r\n\r\nNext below the county as a political subdivision of England came the\r\nhundred, or wapentake, as it was called in the northern shires. One of\r\nthe oldest political units of the country, perhaps the very oldest, it\r\nhad become the least important of all. Its ancient significance as the\r\nprimary organization of the community for judicial purposes disappeared\r\nlong before the beginning of the seventeenth century, leaving only a\r\ndesultory practice of holding a sheriff's semi-annual \"tourn\" through\r\nthe hundreds of the shire; and some traditional payments of fees to the\r\nnoblemen who held the hundred court as a \"liberty,\" or to the crown.\r\nApart from its existence as a unit of jurisdiction, the hundred was\r\nstill put to some use as a subdivision of the county for purposes of\r\ntaxation, for military organization and service, for the preservation\r\nof order, and as the sphere of activity of the high-constable.\r\n[Footnote: Lambarde, Constables, S 25; Cal. of State Pap., Dom., 1637,\r\npp. 39, 104.] The high-constables were, indeed, the only officers of\r\nthe hundreds, one or more being chosen annually by the justices of the\r\npeace in quarter-sessions from the same class of rural gentry as we\r\nhave already seen furnishing the county local officials. The hundred,\r\nfor some reason, took but slight root in colonial soil, though it was\r\nestablished in a few of the colonies, and in such places many of its\r\nEnglish functions reappeared. [Footnote: Howard, Local Constitutional\r\nHistory of the U. 5., 272-286; Wilhelmi, Local Institutions of\r\nMaryland, 60, n. 5.] An ancient Latin law writer says, \"England is\r\ndivided into counties, counties are divided into hundreds (which in\r\nsome parts of England are called wapentakes), and hundreds are again\r\nsubdivided into villas.\" [Footnote: Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum\r\nAngliae, chap. cxxiv.] By using the general word villas (\"vills\") he\r\nevaded one of the greatest difficulties in the description of English\r\nlocal government in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the\r\nconfusing and conflicting use of terms for the smallest subdivision of\r\ncivil government. Shall we use parish, town, township, manor, or\r\ntithing when we speak of a neighborhood organized for the affairs of\r\npetty government? All these terms are used abundantly in the records of\r\nthe time and to a great extent are used indiscriminately.\r\n\r\nThis lack of consistency is quite natural and explicable. In the first\r\nplace, local organization as it existed at this time was the residuum\r\nof several successive systems of custom and law, and contained\r\nsurvivals from the nomenclature of each. \"Township\" or \"town\" was a\r\nterm belonging to a far-distant Anglo-Saxon past, and had been long\r\nobscured by the later institution of tithings and the still later\r\nmanors. Secondly, the union of church and state, the mutual\r\ninterpenetration of the ecclesiastical and civil systems, served to\r\ncomplicate the matter still further by confusing the word \"parish\" with\r\nterms which applied in a non-ecclesiastical sense to the same little\r\ngroup of people and the same tract of land.\r\n\r\nOf all these terms, three--manor, town (or township), and parish--are\r\nthe most usual. A manor was a group of inhabitants and the land they\r\noccupied (usually a single village), so far as these people were\r\nconnected with and dependent upon a certain \"lord of the manor,\" who\r\nhad various rights over the people and their lands. Aside from his\r\nposition as landlord, the most important of these rights was that of\r\nholding a court-baron and a court-leet and view of frank-pledge.\r\n\r\nVarious powers and activities had long gathered around these petty\r\ncourts, but the whole group of manorial rights and duties of\r\njurisdiction and administration was, in 1600, fast becoming an obsolete\r\nand insignificant institution. Yet the terms connected with it had\r\nworked themselves inseparably into local life. Courts-baron were held\r\nin but few places, and almost solely for the purpose of making land\r\ntransfers; courts-leet were held only infrequently and irregularly,\r\nmany lords of manors who possessed the right exercising it but once a\r\nyear or less frequently; the whole system of frank-pledges had long\r\ngone into desuetude. Grants of manorial powers, \"court-leet, court-\r\nbaron, and view of frank-pledge,\" were made in several of the colonial\r\ncharters; but these institutions showed little inclination to renew in\r\nAmerica a vitality they had lost in England.\r\n\r\nThe English word town or township is the nearest equivalent to the\r\nLatin word villa or vill, which is a generic term used in the records,\r\nwithout very exact connotation, for one of those country villages in\r\nwhich the rural population of England was distributed, including the\r\nland connected with the village. Town and township meant the same\r\nthing, except when the former was applied to an urban community. Over\r\nand over again to the same locality first the term \"town\" and then\r\n\"township\" is applied; [Footnote: West Riding Sessions Rolls, passim.]\r\nand a careful search fails to find any distinction drawn between them.\r\nIn the north of England the term town or township seems to have been\r\nespecially familiar and frequently used as a subdivision of some of the\r\nother local units; [Footnote: Fishwick, Hist of Preston, 2.] and it was\r\nin common use everywhere as a synonym for manor or parish.\r\n\r\nWhile all these terms meet us frequently in the records of the\r\nseventeenth century, the term parish, notwithstanding its\r\necclesiastical connotation, was, in fact, superseding all others as the\r\nmost usual appellation to give to the unit of local government. Terms\r\nstrictly applicable to other phases of the local organization were apt\r\nto be applied to the parish. For instance, we hear of the \"constable of\r\na parish,\" [Footnote: Archaeological Review, IV, 344.] although that\r\nofficer was an official of a township; proprietors of \"free\" and \"copy-\r\nhold\" lands of a parish are spoken of, though those terms properly\r\napplied only to a manor; the same is true of an order for a court to be\r\nheld every three weeks in certain parishes, [Footnote: Saalkeld,\r\nReports, III., 98.] the term \"court\" being properly manorial. These\r\nexpressions show the tendency of the time to substitute the term\r\n\"parish\" for more exact terms applied to the local governing body in\r\nits different aspects. It was the \"parish\" that was usually sued,\r\ntaxed, and fined, that received property by bequest, and that was\r\nordered by the government to perform various duties.\r\n\r\nOur colonial forefathers, according to the locality of their origin or\r\nthe particular phase of local government that applied to their new\r\nconditions, used sometimes one term, sometimes another; but in this\r\nstudy of English conditions the parish and the officers whose sphere of\r\naction was the parish may be taken to include all that is necessary,\r\nwith the understanding that our use of the term parish is broad, in\r\nconformity with seventeenth-century usage.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the boundaries of the parish was kept alive by the\r\ntraditional ceremony of perambulation. From time to time, usually once\r\na year, a procession was formed which went the rounds of the outer\r\nboundary, stopping from time to time at well-marked points for various\r\ncommemorative ceremonies. In pre-Reformation times the ceremony was a\r\nreligious one, the priest leading and the parishioners following with\r\ncross, banners, bells, lights, and sacred emblems, successive points\r\nbeing blessed and sprinkled with holy water. [Footnote: Burn,\r\nEcclesiastical Law, II, 133,134.] When religious processions were\r\nforbidden at the Reformation, this ceremony came under the condemnation\r\nof the law; and Queen Elizabeth found it necessary, in order to\r\nperpetuate the useful civil element in it, to direct by proclamation a\r\ncertain form of renewal of the processions. \"The people should, once in\r\nthe year, at the time appointed, with the curate and substantial men of\r\nthe parish, walk about the parish, and at their return to the church\r\nmake their common prayers. And the curate in the said perambulation\r\nwas, at certain convenient places, to admonish the people to give\r\nthanks to God in the beholding of His benefits, and for the increase\r\nand abundance of his fruits upon the face of the earth, with the saying\r\nof the one hundred and third Psalm.\" [Footnote: Gibson, Codex, 213.]\r\n\r\nThe custom survived in this or other forms, [Footnote: Shillingfleet,\r\nEcclesiastical Cases, I., 244.] because there were no surveyed\r\nboundaries, and reliance had to be placed on marked stones and trees,\r\nhill-tops, watercourses, and such indications, interpreted and defined\r\nonly by human tradition. In some remote districts it is still\r\npreserved. From the practice of performing the perambulation in\r\nrogation week it was often called \"the rogation,\" and conversely\r\nrogation days were sometimes called \"gang-days\" [Footnote: Burn,\r\nEcclesiastical Law, II., 133.] In the seventeenth century, as the men\r\nwho afterwards practised it in New England and Virginia must have\r\nremembered, it was still a festivity. In the church-wardens' accounts\r\nfor the parish of St. Clements, Ipswich, in 1638, is the item \"ffor\r\nbread and beare given to the boyes when they wente the boundes of the\r\nparishe, 12s.\" [Footnote: East Anglian, IV., 2d series, 5.] Boys were\r\ntaken as those whose life and memory would naturally be the longest,\r\nand the poorer boys were often especially included as a treat. In\r\nChelsea, Middlesex, at a somewhat later time, a more official feast is\r\nsuggested by the entry: \"Spent at the perambulation dinner, 3 pounds\r\n10s.\" [Footnote: Toulmin Smith, The Parish, 473.]\r\n\r\nNo material obstacle was allowed to interfere with the progress of the\r\nperambulators. They could, by law, enter all dwellings on the boundary\r\nand pass through and even break down all enclosures which lay across\r\nit. Private persons whose houses lay in the line of march of the\r\nperambulators sometimes provided food and drink for them, and this\r\nbecame so customary that efforts were made, though unsuccessfully, to\r\nenforce this custom by law. [Footnote: Burn, Ecclesiastical Law, II.,\r\n133.]\r\n\r\nIn describing the officers of the parish we pass from the class of\r\ncountry gentry, from which the sheriffs, coroners, justices of the\r\npeace, and high-constables were drawn, to a group of lower social rank.\r\nIn the towns they may have been of somewhat higher or at least more\r\nvaried status, but in the rural parishes the officers were of very\r\nhumble position. In the invaluable description of England written by\r\nHarrison in the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth, from which we\r\nhave had occasion to quote so frequently, the author says: \"The fourth\r\nand last sort of people in England are day-labourers, poor husbandmen,\r\nand some retailers (which have no free land), copyholders, and all\r\nartificers, as tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, brickmakers, masons,\r\netc. ... This fourth and last sort of people therefore have neither\r\nvoice nor authority in the commonwealth, but are to be ruled and not to\r\nrule others: yet they are not altogether neglected, for ... in villages\r\nthey are commonly made churchwardens, sidesmen, aleconners, now and\r\nthen constables, and many times enjoy the name of head boroughs.\"\r\n[Footnote: Harrison, Description of England (Camelot ed.), 13.]\r\n\r\nThe most active and conspicuous officer of the parish or township was\r\nthe constable, or petty constable, as he is often called, to\r\ndistinguish him from the high-constable of the hundred. He was\r\nappointed by the court-leet, where this was still held; in other cases\r\nby the steward of the lord of the manor, the vestry of the parish, or,\r\nas a part of their residuary duties, by the justices of the peace. The\r\nregular form of oath of the constable may be quoted in some fulness to\r\nshow the nature of his duties. \"You shall swear that you shall well and\r\ntruly serve our sovereign lord, the king, in the office of a constable.\r\nYou shall see and cause his majesty's peace to be well and duly kept\r\nand preserved, according to your power. You shall arrest all such\r\npersons as in your sight and presence shall ride or go armed\r\noffensively, or shall commit or make any riot, affray, or other breach\r\nof his majesty's peace. You shall do your best endeavor to apprehend\r\nall felons, barrators, and rioters, or persons riotously assembled; and\r\nif any such offenders shall make resistance you shall levy hue and cry\r\nand shall pursue them until they be taken. You shall do your best\r\nendeavors that the watch in and about your town be duly kept for the\r\napprehending of rogues, vagabonds, nightwalkers, eavesdroppers, and\r\nother suspected persons, and of such as go armed and the like. ... You\r\nshall well and duly execute all precepts and warrants to you directed\r\nfrom the justices of the peace of the county or higher officers. In\r\ntime of hay or corn harvest you shall cause all meet persons to serve\r\nby the day for the mowing, reaping, and getting in of corn or hay. You\r\nshall, in Easter week, cause your parishioners to chuse surveyors for\r\nthe mending of the highways in your parish. ... And you shall well and\r\nduly, according to your knowledge, power, and ability, do and execute\r\nall things belonging to the office of a constable so long as you shall\r\ncontinue in this office. So help you God.\" [Footnote: Dalton, The\r\nCountry Justice, chap. clxxiv.]\r\n\r\nThe constable, among the other duties prescribed by his oath, had to\r\n\"raise the hue and cry\" when it was demanded--that is to say, if any\r\none were assaulted or robbed and appealed to the constable of the\r\nparish in which the injury occurred, the constable must summon out his\r\nneighbors, whether it were by day or by night, to seek the culprit. If\r\nnot successful he must give notice to the constables of the adjacent\r\nparishes, who were similarly to raise the hue and cry in their\r\nneighborhoods. If the offender was not then discovered the person who\r\nsuffered the loss might bring suit for its recovery from the whole\r\nhundred in which the attack occurred. [Footnote: Ibid., chap. lxxxiv,]\r\n\r\nIn practice hue and cry was a very ineffective method of capturing ill-\r\ndoers. Harrison says: \"I have known by my own experience felons being\r\ntaken to have escaped out of the stocks, being rescued by others for\r\nwant of watch and guard, that thieves have been let pass, because the\r\ncovetous and greedy parishioners would neither take the pains nor be at\r\nthe charge to carry them to prison, if it were far off; that when hue\r\nand cry have been made even to the faces of some constables, they have\r\nsaid: 'God restore your loss! I have other business at this time.'\"\r\n[Footnote: Harrison, Description of England (Camelot ed.), 247.] To\r\nprosecute petty offenders, to force laborers to serve during harvest-\r\ntime, to sign their testimonials when they wished to leave the parish,\r\nand to see that innkeepers refused no travellers, gave the constable\r\nconsiderable duties of local supervision.\r\n\r\nThe constable must, with the advice of the minister and of one other\r\ninhabitant of the parish, whip any rogue, vagabond, or sturdy beggar\r\nwho appeared in the parish, and then send him, with a testimonial to\r\nthe fact of the whipping, back to his native parish. The word rogue was\r\na comprehensive term as used in the laws of Elizabeth, including\r\nwandering sailors, fortune-tellers, collectors of money for charities,\r\nfencers, bearwards, minstrels, common players of interludes, jugglers,\r\ntinkers, peddlers, and many others, and adequate whipping of them and\r\nstarting them in the direct route homeward must have been no sinecure.\r\n[Footnote: Lambarde, Duties of Constables, S 45.]\r\n\r\nA contemporary testimonial with which such a person was provided may\r\nnot be without interest as an illustration of the manners of the time.\r\n\"A. B., a sturdy rogue of tall stature, red-haired and bearded, about\r\nthe age of thirty years, and having a wart neere under his right eie,\r\nborn (as he confesseth) at East Tilberie, in Essex, was taken begging\r\nat Shorne in this county of Kent, the tenth of March, 1598, and was\r\nthen and there lawfully whipped therefor, and hee is appointed to goe\r\nto East Tilberie aforesaid, the direct way by Gravesend, over the river\r\nof Thamise; for which hee is allowed one whole day, and no more at his\r\nperil; subscribed and sealed the day and yeare aforesaid. By us\"\r\n(signed by the minister, the constable, and a parishioner). [Footnote:\r\nLambarde, Duties of Constables, S 45.] It is no wonder that constables\r\nare advised \"in every corner to have a readie hand and whip.\"\r\n\r\nThe constable was also the warden of such arms and armor as each parish\r\nkept, or was supposed to keep, in obedience to the militia\r\nrequirements. A writer of Elizabeth's time says: \"The said armour and\r\nmunition likewise is kept in one several place of every town, appointed\r\nby the consent of the whole parish, where it is always ready to be had\r\nand worn within an hour's warning. ... Certes there is almost no\r\nvillage so poor ... that hath not sufficient furniture in a readiness\r\nto set forth three or four soldiers, as one archer, one gunner, one\r\npike, and a billman.\" [Footnote: Harrison, Description of England\r\n(Camelot ed.), 224.]\r\n\r\nAn account of the armor kept in a parish in Middlesex is entered in the\r\nvestry accounts of the year 1583. \"Note of the armour for the parish of\r\nFulham: first, a corslet, with a pyke, sworde, and daiger, furnished in\r\nall points, a gyrdle only excepted. Item, two hargobushes, with flaskes\r\nand touch-boxes to the same; two morryons; two swords, and two daigers,\r\nwhich are all for Fulham side only. All which armore are, and do\r\nremayne in the possession and appointment of John Palton, of Northend,\r\nbeing constable of Fulhamsyde the yere above wrytten.\" [Footnote:\r\nToulmin Smith, The Parish, 473.] One may easily imagine the nature and\r\nvalue of such accoutrements, and of the villagers who were occasionally\r\npressed into the service to wear them. Mouldy and Bullcalf, Wart,\r\nShadow, and Feeble, and Falstaff's whole company of \"cankers of a calm\r\nworld and a long peace\" may readily enough have been drawn from the\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese duties the constable must fulfil at his own initiation or upon\r\nthe recurrence of the occasion for them. But the great part of his\r\nduties were those imposed upon him from above in special cases--that is\r\nto say, in carrying out the warrants and precepts of the justices of\r\nthe peace, or occasionally of the coroner, sheriff, lord-lieutenant, or\r\nstill higher officials. If the justice of the peace was the man-of-all-\r\nwork, as has been said, of the government of the time, the constable\r\nwas the tool and instrument with which he worked. The constable was\r\nrequired to arrest all persons who were to be bound over by the\r\njustices to keep the peace, and all felons and other ill-doers for whom\r\na warrant had been issued, and to bring them before the justices into\r\njail. And woe be to him if he allowed such a prisoner to escape. The\r\njustices might construe his inactivity as participation in the crime of\r\nthe prisoner, or he might be fined to the extent of all his property.\r\n[Footnote: Lambarde, Duties of Constables, S 15]\r\n\r\nThe constable must carry out the lesser sentences of the justices,\r\ninflicting the punishment ordered and collecting the fines imposed. For\r\ninstance, when a certain poor woman, Elizabeth Armistead, was convicted\r\nof petty larceny at the West Riding Sessions, in 1598, it was ordered\r\nby the justices that \"she shall nowe be delivered to the constable of\r\nKeerbie, and he to cause her to be stripped naked from the middle\r\nupward and soundly whipped thorowe the said town of Keerbie, and by hym\r\ndelivered to the constable of Kirkby and he to see like execution\r\nwithin his town, and the next markett att Weatherbie to delyver her to\r\nthe constables of Weatherbie, and they to see like punishment of her\r\nexecuted thorow their towns.\" [Footnote: West Riding Sessions Rolls,\r\n58] In assessing and collecting taxes and in obtaining information the\r\nconstables were at the command of county and hundred authorities. They\r\nwere used as the active or at least the most available intermediaries\r\nbetween the justices of the peace and the individuals whom it was\r\ndesirable to reach. [Footnote: Hist. MSS. Commission, Report XIV., App,\r\npt. iv, 28, 67.] They were by no means ideal instruments; many were\r\nextremely ignorant--as, for instance, the constable of Collingbourne\r\nDucis, who in 1650 prays to be relieved from his office because he can\r\nneither read nor write, and is obliged to go to the minister and divers\r\nothers to get his warrants read. [Footnote: Hist. MSS. Commission,\r\nReport I., 121] They were constantly being fined by the justices for\r\nneglect of their duties or for inefficiency. [Footnote: Middlesex\r\nCounty Records, II., 36, 41, 139.]\r\n\r\nThe most important remaining ancient parochial officers were the\r\nchurch-wardens. Their position and functions were not so purely\r\necclesiastical as the name would suggest. Their duties included, it is\r\ntrue, the care of the parish church and the provision of other material\r\nrequirements for religious services. But they also included many things\r\nwhich were quite clearly temporal or civil in their nature. Coke says\r\nof their position, \"The office is mere temporal.\" [Footnote: Lambarde,\r\nDuties of Constables, SS 57-60.] That is to say, the church-wardens\r\nrepresented the parishioners, not the minister or the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities. They formed a quasi-corporation for the holding of the\r\npersonal property that belonged to the parish, and could sue and be\r\nsued as trustees for the parish. [Footnote: Lambarde, Duties of Church-\r\nwardens, S 1.]\r\n\r\nThe almost invariable custom was for the body of the parishioners at a\r\nvestry meeting in Easter week to choose two church-wardens for the next\r\nyear. But neither the number nor the mode of appointment was at this\r\ntime quite fixed. During the first half of the seventeenth century\r\nclergymen were inclined to magnify their office, and the canons of 1603\r\nand 1639 gave to the minister of the parish some control over the\r\nchoice of the wardens; although whenever the rights of the parishioners\r\nwere asserted and an established custom shown, the courts upheld this\r\ncustom against ecclesiastical encroachments. [Footnote: Toulmin Smith,\r\nThe Parish, 78-87.]\r\n\r\nThe financial powers of the church-wardens were considerable, though\r\nexercised in most cases along with the constable, and in many only\r\nafter the approval of the whole body of parishioners at a vestry\r\nmeeting. They had, of course, the duty of providing for the repairs of\r\nthe church and of taxing their neighbors for this purpose. Unless\r\npreviously settled upon by the parishioners themselves, they levied and\r\ncollected the local taxes already described as being imposed by the\r\njustices upon the parishes for various purposes. They had the power to\r\nseize and sell the property of such parishioners as refused or\r\nneglected to pay the amounts assessed upon them. Many of the parishes\r\nalso received considerable sums by gift or bequest, which were\r\ninvested, and the income expended for the poor or other parish objects.\r\n[Footnote: Ibid., chap, v., App.]\r\n\r\nProperty in land and houses also belonged to some parishes, apart from\r\nthe minister's glebe, and the renting and accounts fell within the\r\nchurch-warden's duties. Various means of combining the securing of\r\nfunds with much neighborhood merriment, even in those days of militant\r\nPuritanism, were used by the parish authorities, such as \"church-ales,\"\r\n\"pigeon-holes,\" Hock-tide games, Easter games, processions, and festive\r\ngatherings, at all of which farthings, pence, and shillings were\r\ngathered. [Footnote: Various quotations in Toulmin Smith, The Parish,\r\nchap, vii., S 12.] Such accounts of these various funds and the record\r\nof the thousand and one petty expenditures for local purposes as were\r\nkept were usually the work of the church-wardens and made their office\r\none of real local importance. In fact, a whole cycle of parish life\r\npasses before us in these accounts. \"Paid the carpenters 5s. for a\r\nbarrow to carry the people that died of the sickness to church to bury\r\nthem.\" \"For a coat for the whipper, and making, 3s.\" \"For too payre of\r\nglovys for Robin Hode and Mayde Maryan, 3d.\" \"Received for the May-\r\npole, 1 pound 4s.\" \"Paid Robert Warden, the constable, which he\r\ndisbursed for carrying away the witches, 11s.\" [Footnote: Ibid., 465-\r\n472.]\r\n\r\nThe church-wardens, under a law of Queen Mary, [Footnote: 2 and 3\r\nPhilip and Mary, chap. viii.] with the constables and parishioners,\r\nselected the surveyors of highways; and under two statutes of Queen\r\nElizabeth [Footnote: 8 Eliz., chap, xv., and 14 Eliz., chap. xi.] every\r\nyear appointed two men who should be named \"the distributers of the\r\nprovision for the destruction of noisome fowle and vermine.\" A tax was\r\nlevied upon the parishioners to provide these officers with funds, and\r\nit then became their duty to pay bounties for the heads and eggs of\r\ncrows, rooks, starlings, and many other birds. A long list of four-\r\nfooted beasts is also included in the definition of \"vermine,\" and\r\nrates ranging from a shilling for a fox to a halfpenny for a mole were\r\nestablished. [Footnote: Lambarde, Office of Distributers, etc., 92.]\r\nThe mole-catcher was a regular employe of some parishes. [Footnote:\r\nHist. MSS. Commission, Report III., App., 331; V., App., 597.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the church-wardens were ex-officio overseers of the poor. By\r\nthe great poor law of 1597 the church-wardens, along with four\r\noverseers of the poor appointed each year at Easter by the justices,\r\nhad the whole charge of the relief of the poor. [Footnote: 8 Leonard,\r\nThe Poor Law, 76, etc.]\r\n\r\nThey were to estimate the annual costs and to tax their fellow-townsmen\r\nfor this purpose. From this time forward taxation for the poor under\r\nthe control of parish officers became the most important, as it was the\r\nheaviest, of local charges. The constant efforts of the Privy Council,\r\nthrough the justices of the peace, to enforce the poor law, kept\r\nchurch-wardens and other overseers of the poor up to their duties and\r\nengaged them in constant conferences with the justices and in making\r\nreports, as well as in the actual work of poor relief.\r\n\r\nA vestry clerk existed in some parishes, and later such an office\r\nbecame quite general and influential, but at this period the records\r\nwere generally preserved by one of the church-wardens or by the\r\nminister. The vestry-clerk is of special interest as being apparently\r\nthe prototype of the town-clerk in the American colonies. [Footnote:\r\nHoward, Local Constitutional History of the U. S., 39.]\r\n\r\nVarious other petty officers existed, but their duties were either\r\nidentical with those already described, or insignificant, or so\r\nexceptional as not to reward inquiry and description here. Such were\r\nthe beadle, sexton, haywards, ale-conners, waymen, way-wardens,\r\nsidesmen, synodsmen, swornmen, questmen, and perhaps some others.\r\n[Footnote: Discussed in Charming, Town and County Government in the\r\nEnglish Colonies (Johns Hopkins University Studies, II.), No. 10, p.\r\n18, etc.]\r\n\r\nSuch being the officers whose sphere of activity was the parish, it\r\nremains to describe the general assembly of the people of the parish,\r\nthe vestry. This name arose apparently from the practice of meeting in\r\nthe part of the church in which the vestments were kept. Ordinarily,\r\nall who held house or land in a parish, no matter on what tenure, were\r\nmembers of the vestry of the parish. All inhabitants, therefore--land-\r\nowners, free tenants, copy-holders, laborers occupying cottages, even\r\nthose who held land in the parish but lived somewhere else--were by law\r\nat liberty to attend the meetings of the parishioners and to join in\r\nthe exercise of their functions.\r\n\r\nSuch a body is of great interest. [Footnote: Coke, 5 Report, 66, 67.]\r\nThose officials whose positions and functions have been discussed in\r\nthe two preceding chapters drew all their powers from the crown, and\r\nthe duties that they performed were imposed upon them by statute law or\r\nby royal instruction. The same is true of a considerable part of the\r\nactivity of constables and church-wardens. But the vestry of the parish\r\nexisted as a body which within certain limits had powers of government\r\nof its own, and could impose duties upon parish officials, appoint\r\ncommittees and require services from them, adopt by-laws which bound\r\nall the inhabitants, and impose taxes upon the landholders of the\r\nparish which they were bound to pay.\r\n\r\nYet evidences of anything like regular meetings of the parishioners\r\nare, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, so scanty as to leave\r\nconsiderable doubt as to whether they occurred at all generally. They\r\nare not mentioned in the legal text-books of the time, which were, of\r\ncourse, written by men who looked from above downward and were not\r\ninterested in local institutions as such. A few accounts of such vestry\r\nmeetings remain, [Footnote: E.g., those of Steeple Ashton, quoted in\r\nToulmin Smith, The Parish, chap, vii, SS 12.] but the action taken at\r\nthem was apparently restricted to the choice of parish officers, the\r\nadoption of by-laws for the carrying out of necessary taxation and\r\nother distribution of burdens, and for matters connected with the\r\nbuilding or repair of the church. The attendance probably consisted\r\nonly of the more substantial members of the parish and of those who\r\nheld office and must present reports. The parish life resided more in\r\nthe activity of its officials than of its assembly. Vigorous local\r\nself-government could not have existed without leaving more distinct\r\ntraces than it has done, and our study of the political system of the\r\ntime will have made it clear that much local independence was not\r\nsuited to the period of the Tudors and Stuarts. [Footnote: See Toulmin\r\nSmith, The Parish, chaps, ii., iv., vii.; and Gneist, Self-Government,\r\nbook III., chap, ix., S 115.] Such was the provision for the carrying\r\nout of those matters of local concern in the county, the hundred, and\r\nrural parish which were not performed by immediate officials or\r\ncommissioners of the central government. It is evident that in the\r\nearly seventeenth century the motive power for almost all government,\r\nlocal as well as general, emanated from the national government--from\r\nthe king, Privy Council, and Parliament. It was a vigorous, assertive,\r\ncentralized administration, eager to carry out its will and enforce\r\norder, uniformity, and its own ideas upon all persons and bodies in\r\nEngland. No shade of doubt of their own wisdom or reluctance to\r\noverride local or individual liberty of action troubled the thought or\r\nweakened the resolution of the Tudor and Stuart sovereigns and their\r\nministers. Nor were their Parliaments antagonistic to the principle of\r\ncentralized government, even when they wished to curb unrestrained\r\nroyal control of it. Strong government was in entire consonance with\r\nthe spirit of the time.\r\n\r\nYet this ambitious central government was working with very inadequate\r\nand unsuitable instruments. Instead of a body of efficient and\r\nresponsible officials, directly and immediately dependent upon their\r\nsuperiors, receiving wages and hoping for promotion, such as successful\r\ncentralized governments have usually possessed, the king and council\r\nmade use of the old and cumbrous machinery of local self-government as\r\nthey found it. It was quite unsuited to their purposes. Sheriffs,\r\ncoroners, high and petty constables, church-wardens, even justices of\r\nthe peace, had come down from a period when government was of quite\r\nanother and more primitive character, in which the central power\r\ncounted for far less, local powers for far more. Most of the local\r\nofficials were unpaid, and the others were dependent on insignificant\r\nfees for such money reward as they obtained. The labors imposed upon\r\nthem were performed only from a sense of duty, loyalty, or necessity,\r\nnot as a fair return for remuneration received.\r\n\r\nThere was little provision for a wise selection of office-holders, so\r\nfar as regarded their suitability to the objects of the central\r\nadministration. The county and hundred officials were taken from one\r\nrestricted class, the rural gentry; the township and parish officials\r\nwere chosen by their neighbors from their own number. In a word, the\r\ngovernment of Elizabeth, James, and Charles was trying to carry on an\r\nambitious, centralized administration by means of an unpaid, untrained,\r\nand carelessly selected group of local officials, whose offices had\r\nbeen established and whose characters had been formed for a system of\r\nmuch more limited powers and of more independent local life.\r\n\r\nAt certain times, as in the period of personal government of Charles\r\nI., something like a hierarchy seemed about to develop itself, in which\r\nthe Privy Council, speaking in the name of the king, gave instructions\r\nto the justices of assize, the justices of assize to the sheriffs and\r\njustices of the peace, the justices of the peace to the high-constable\r\nof the hundred, and the high-constable to the petty constable, church-\r\nwardens, and other township or parish officials. But no such regularity\r\nwas attained; the council frequently communicated directly with the\r\njustices of the peace, the sheriff with the parish officers; and the\r\nadministration became no more systematic as time went on.\r\n\r\nThe primary governmental division of the country, the shire, was the\r\nsphere of much activity; but it was not automatic, and acted wholly or\r\nalmost wholly in response to pressure from above. The ultimate unit of\r\nlocal government, the parish, township, or manor, had many and\r\ninteresting functions, but they were for the most part either declining\r\nsurvivals of earlier powers, or new forms of activity imposed upon it\r\nfrom above. It had the necessary officials and the political rights to\r\nenable it to do a great deal, but it showed few signs of vigorous life.\r\nThus government in England in the early seventeenth century was so\r\norganized that at the top was an energetic national government, midway\r\nan active but dependent county organization, and at the bottom the\r\nparish with a residuum of ancient but unutilized powers of self-\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nNo greater contrast could be noted in the position of men than that\r\nbetween the Englishman at home, in the early seventeenth century, and\r\nthe Englishman who emigrated to America. Almost all the conditions that\r\nsurrounded the former were reversed in the case of the latter. The\r\npressure of central government was immediately and almost completely\r\nwithdrawn. Many of the most urgent activities of government in England,\r\nsuch as the administration of the poor law and the restriction of\r\nvagabondage, almost ceased in the colonies. The class of settled rural\r\ngentry from which most local officials were drawn in England did not\r\nexist in America. On the other hand, the wilderness, the Indians, the\r\nfreedom from restraint, the religious liberty, the opportunity for\r\neconomic and social rise in the New World made a set of conditions\r\nwhich had been quite unknown in the mother-country.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the colonists had to make a choice from among the\r\ninstitutions with which they were familiar at home, of those which were\r\napplicable to their new needs. Of such institutions of local government\r\nin England there were, as has been seen, a considerable number and\r\nvariety. Naturally, some functions which had been prominent at home\r\nwere reduced to insignificance in the colonies; some which had been\r\nalmost forgotten or had remained quite undeveloped in England gained\r\nunwonted importance in America. Almost every local official or body\r\nwhich existed in England reappeared in some part or other of the\r\nEnglish colonies, although often with much altered powers and duties.\r\nAll the familiar names are to be found, though sometimes with new\r\nmeanings and always more or less considerably adapted to new\r\nconditions. Moreover, the choice was in the main restricted to familiar\r\nEnglish institutions, for in the great variety of system in different\r\nparts of the colonies there was scarcely an official or body which did\r\nnot have its prototype in England. [Footnote: Howard, Local\r\nConstitutional History of the U. S.; Channing, Town and County\r\nGovernment in the English Colonies; Adams, Germanic Origin of New\r\nEngland Towns. Cf. also Tyler, England in America; Andrews, Colonial\r\nSelf-Government; Greene, Colonial Commonwealth (American Nation\r\nSeries), IV., V., VI.]\r\n\r\nIn this as in other matters, the foundations of America were laid in\r\nEuropean conditions and occurrences. European needs sent explorers on\r\ntheir voyages of discovery, and European ambitions equipped adventurers\r\nfor their expeditions of conquest; the commercial projects of England,\r\nFrance, Holland, and Sweden led to the establishment of the principal\r\nNew-World colonies; the economic exigencies and the political and\r\nreligious struggles of Europe sent a flood of settlers to people them;\r\nthe institutions of Spain, France, Holland, and England all found a\r\nlodgment in the western continent; and those of England became the\r\nbasis of the great nation which has reached so distinct a primacy in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCRITICAL ESSAY ON AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHIES\r\n\r\nNo general bibliography of the whole field of this volume exists,\r\nalthough two comprehensive publications (both described below) have\r\nspecial bibliographic sections: The Cambridge Modern History has full\r\nlists of books, less well analyzed than the systematic and useful\r\nbibliographies in Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire Generale.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SECONDARY WORKS\r\n\r\nSeveral general histories of Europe covering the field of this volume\r\nhave been published in recent years or are now appearing. The most\r\nimportant are: Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire Generale (12 vols., 1893-\r\n1901), of which vols. III. and VI. apply most nearly to the subjects\r\nincluded in this book; The Cambridge Modern History (to be in 12 vols.,\r\n1902-), especially vols. I.-IV.; H. H. Helmolt, History of the World,\r\ntranslated from the German (to be in 8 vols., 1902-), especially vols.\r\nI. and VII. Helmolt differs from all other general histories by its\r\narrangement in accordance with ethnographical and geographical\r\ndivisions rather than historical epochs; he pays also especial\r\nattention to economic phenomena. The following three volumes in the\r\nseries entitled Periods of European History, give an account of this\r\nperiod in somewhat shorter form: Richard Lodge, The Close of the Middle\r\nAges, 1272-1494 (1901); A. H. Johnson, Europe in the Sixteenth Century,\r\n1494-1598 (1897); H. O. Wakeman, Europe, 1598-1715 (1904).\r\n\r\nTwo excellent histories of the period of discovery are O. F. Peschel,\r\nGeschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen (1858), and Sophus Ruge,\r\nGeschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen (1881). More recent works\r\nare S. Gunther, Das Zeitalter der Entdeckungen (1901), and Carlo\r\nErrera, L'Epoca delle Grandi Scoperti Geografiche (1902).\r\n\r\nSPECIAL QUESTION ON COLUMBUS\r\n\r\nThe seemingly well-established view that Columbus when he discovered\r\nAmerica was in search of a direct western route to the East Indies and\r\nCathay, and that he had been led to form this plan by correspondence\r\nwith the Florentine scholar Toscanelli, was attacked by Henry Vignaud,\r\nLa Lettre et la Carte de Toscanelli sur la Route des Indes par L'Orient\r\n(1901), and in a translation and extension of the same work under the\r\ntitle Toscanelli and Columbus (1902). Vignaud considers the letter of\r\nToscanelli a forgery, and the object of Columbus in making the voyage\r\nthe discovery of a certain island of which he had been informed by a\r\ndying pilot. His work elicited many replies in the form of book reviews\r\nor more extended works. Of the former may be mentioned those of E. G.\r\nBourne (American Historical Review, January, 1903) and Sophus Ruge\r\n(Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde zu Berlin, 1902); among the\r\nlatter, the monumental work, Christopher Columbus, His Life, His Work,\r\nHis Remains, by John Boyd Thacher (I., 1903). Few scholars seem to have\r\nbeen convinced by the arguments of Vignaud, but the whole question must\r\nbe considered as still undetermined. The last word is E. G. Bourne,\r\nSpain in America (The American Nation, III., 1904).\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA large number of the contemporary accounts of the early expeditions of\r\ndiscovery and adventure are published by the Hakluyt Society. These\r\nvolumes are provided with introductions of great value and with\r\nnumerous maps, glossaries, and other material illustrative of the time.\r\nThey cover a long period of time and include many lines of travel not\r\nreferred to in this book; but many of them refer to the early\r\nexpeditions to the southeast, west, and northwest which had much to do\r\nwith the discovery and exploration of America. Some of the most\r\nimportant publications of this character in the series are the\r\nfollowing: Select Letters of Columbus, edited by R. H. Major (II, and\r\nXLIII, 1849 and 1870); Narratives of Early Voyages to the Northwest,\r\nedited by Thomas Rundall (V., 1851); India in the Fifteenth Century,\r\nedited by R. H. Major (XXII., 1859); The Commentaries of the Great\r\nAfonso Dalboquerque, edited by Walter de Gray Birch (LIII., LV., LXII.,\r\nLXIX., 1875, 1880, and 1883); The Voyage of John Huyghen van Linschoten\r\nto the East Indies, edited by A. C. Burnell and P. A. Tiele (LXX. and\r\nLXXI., 1884); The Journal of Christopher Columbus, edited by C. R.\r\nMarkham (LXXXVI., 1892); The Discovery and Conquest of Guinea, Written\r\nby Gomes Eannes de Azurara, edited by C. R. Beazley and Edgar Prestage\r\n(XCV. and C., 1896 and 1900); The First Voyage of Vasco da Gama, edited\r\nby E. G. Ravenstein (XCIX., 1898); Texts and Versions of John de Piano\r\nCarpini and William de Rubruquis, edited by C. R. Beazley (1903).\r\n\r\nThe standard editions of the narratives of the early land travellers in\r\neastern Asia are those of the Recueil de Voyages et de Memoires publie\r\npar la Societe de Geographie, including (IV., 1839) Relations des\r\nVoyages de Guillaume de Rubruk, Jean du Plan Carpin, etc. (edited by M.\r\nA. R. D'Avezac); and Schafer et Cordier, Recueil de Voyages et de\r\nDocuments pour Servir a L'Histoire de la Geographie, especially\r\n\"Voyages en Asie ... du ... Odoric de Pordenone\" (edited by Henri\r\nCordier). English translations of Rubruquis and Pordenone also appear\r\nas an appendix in Travels of Sir John Mandeville, edited by A. W.\r\nPollard (1900). Sir John Mandeville is worthless as an historical\r\nsource, as his genuine material is all drawn from these sources and\r\nfrom Marco Polo, and there is no probability that he ever travelled in\r\nthe East. His own additions are usually mendacious. The standard\r\nedition of Marco Polo is that of Sir Henry Yule (2 vols., 1871). This\r\nhas just been reprinted with additional editorial notes by Henri\r\nCordier, under the title, The Book of Ser Marco Polo the Venetian,\r\nConcerning the Kingdoms and Marvels of the East, etc. (1903). A\r\nvaluable collection of narratives of early discovery is M. F. de\r\nNavarrete, Coleccion de los Viages y Descubrimientos (5 vols., 1825-\r\n1837). Those of particular interest to England are in Richard Hakluyt,\r\nPrincipal Navigations, Voyages, and Discoveries (1589, reprinted 1903,\r\nto be in 12 vols.).\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nAmong the standard histories of mediaeval and modern geography are\r\nJoachim Lelewel, Geographie du Moyen Age (4 vols., 1852-1857); Vivien\r\nde St. Martin, Histoire de la Geographie et des Decouvertes\r\nGeographiques (1873); M. F. Vicomte de Santarem, Essai sur L'Histoire\r\nde la Cosmographie pendant le Moyen Age (3 vols., 1849-1852); and C. R.\r\nBeazley, The Dawn of Modern Geography (vols. I. and II., 1897 and\r\n1901). A full account of the history and development of maps,\r\nespecially of the form known as portolani, is to be found in the two\r\nworks translated from the Swedish of A. E. Nordenskiold: Facsimile\r\nAtlas to the Early History of Cartography (1889), Periplus, an Essay on\r\nthe Early History of Charts and Sailing-Directions (1 vol. and an\r\natlas, 1897); G. Wauverman, Histoire de L'Ecole Cartographique Belge et\r\nAnversois du 16 degrees Siecle (2 vols., 1895).\r\n\r\nThe state of geographical knowledge at the beginning of the period of\r\nexplorations is well described in C. R. Beazley, Introduction to the\r\nvolume of the Hakluyt Society's publications for 1899. F. Kunstmann,\r\nDie Kenntniss Indiens in XV. Jahrhunderts (1863); and G. H. Pertz, Der\r\nAelteste Versuch zur Entdeckung des Seeweges nach Ostindien (1859),\r\ndescribe two important phases of that subject.\r\n\r\nThe fullest and best work on the relations between the Orient and the\r\nOccident, the trade-routes, the objects of trade, and the methods of\r\nits administration is Wilhelm Heyd, Geschichte des Levantehandels im\r\nMittelalter (2 vols., 1879). There is a French translation of this work\r\n(1885-1887), which is later and has been corrected by the author. There\r\nis a valuable article on ancient trade in Encyclopaedia Biblica, IV.,\r\n48, etc. Much that is suggestive and informing concerning Eastern\r\ncommerce and trade-routes can be found in Sir W. W. Hunter, History of\r\nBritish India, I. (1899), and on the products of the East in Sir George\r\nBirdwood, Report of Commissioners for the Paris Exhibition of 1878\r\n(1878). Some information concerning trade organization in the\r\nMediterranean Sea and throughout Europe can be found in William\r\nCunningham, An Essay on Western Civilization in Its Economic Aspects (2\r\nvols., 1898-1900). H. H. Helmolt, General History, VII., pt. i., pp. 1-\r\n139, has a long and valuable chapter on \"The Economic Development of\r\nWestern Europe Since the Time of the Crusades,\" by Dr. Richard Mayr.\r\nJohn Fiske, The Discovery of America (2 vols., 1892), contains an\r\ninteresting popular account of the trade conditions of the time and of\r\nthose explorations which were directed westward.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the later commercial companies is described and the\r\nprovisions of their charters analyzed in P. Bonnassieux, Les Grandes\r\nCompagnies de Commerce (1892). This work is somewhat superficial, being\r\nbased, apparently, entirely on works in the French and Latin languages,\r\nand using secondary materials where primary sources are attainable; but\r\nit stands almost alone in its subject, and has, therefore, considerable\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nNaval architecture is described in Auguste Jal, Archeologie Navale (2\r\nvols., 1840); and J. P. E. Jurien de la Graviere, Les Manns du XV. et\r\ndu XVI. Siecle (1879); Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, Don John of\r\nAustria (2 vols., 1883).\r\n\r\nITALY AND THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN\r\n\r\nThe best general account of Italy during the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies is in Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire Generale, III., chaps, ix.\r\nand x., and IV., chap. i. For the intellectual and artistic history of\r\nItaly as a whole, J. Burckhardt, The Civilization of the Renaissance in\r\nItaly (1860, English translation, 2 vols.), is the most satisfactory\r\nwork. J. A. Symonds, Renaissance in Italy (7 vols., 1875-1886), takes\r\nup many sides of the period. A good general history of Venice in small\r\ncompass is H. P. Brown, Venice: a Historical Sketch of the Republic\r\n(1893).\r\n\r\nM. G. Canale, Storia del Commercio dei Viaggi, ... degl' Italiani\r\n(1866), and Storia della Republica di Genoa (1858-1864), contain much\r\ninformation about Mediterranean trade and voyages, especially of the\r\nGenoese.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of Venice is described in H. F. Brown, Calendar of State\r\nPapers, Venetian, Introduction, I. (1864).\r\n\r\nOf the fondaco and the German merchants in Venice a description is\r\ngiven in H. Simonsfeld, Der Fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venedig (2 vols.,\r\n1887). Many additional sources are in G. Thomas, Capitolare dei\r\nVisdomini del Fontego dei Todechi (1874). A valuable article on the\r\nsame subject is W. Heyd, \"Das Haus der deutschen Kaufleute in Venedig,\"\r\nin Historische Zeitschrift, XXXII., 193-220.\r\n\r\nThe standard history of the rise of the Ottoman Empire is J. W.\r\nZinkeisen, Geschichte des Osmanischen Reichs in Europa (6 vols., 1840).\r\nMore modern works are A. La Jonquiere, Histoire de L'Empire Ottoman\r\n(1881); and G. F. Herzberg, Geschichte des Bysantischen und des\r\nOsmanischen Reiches (1883).\r\n\r\nAn excellent work on the fifteenth century is Edwin Pears, The\r\nDestruction of the Greek Empire and the Story of the Capture of\r\nConstantinople by the Turks (2 vols., 1903). For later history, see L.\r\nvon Ranke, Die Osmanen in XVI. und XVII. Jahrhundert (1827). A short\r\nand good popular account is A. Lane-Poole, Turkey (1886). Good sections\r\nare devoted to the Ottoman Turks in the Cambridge Modern History (I.,\r\nchap, iii., by J. B. Bury); and in Lavisse et Rambaud, Histoire\r\nGenerale (III., chap, xvi., and IV., chap, xix.), by A. Rambaud.\r\n\r\nPORTUGAL IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\nA short but excellent history of Portugal is H. M. Stephens, The Story\r\nof Portugal (1891, Stories of the Nations Series).\r\n\r\nThe interesting character and significant work of Prince Henry the\r\nNavigator have made him the subject of many biographies. One of the\r\nearliest of these was G. de Veer, Prinz Heinrich und seine Zeit (1864).\r\nMore detailed is R. H. Major, Life of Prince Henry the Navigator (1868,\r\nabbreviated edition, 1874). A number of other biographies were called\r\nforth by the interest in the five hundredth anniversary of Henry's\r\nbirth, which was coincident with the four hundredth anniversary of the\r\ndiscovery of America. A partial list of these is as follows: C. R.\r\nBeazley, Prince Henry the Navigator (1890); G. Wauverman, Henri le\r\nNavigateur et L'Academie Portugaise de Sagres (1890); J. P. O. Martins,\r\nOs Filhos de Dom Joao I. (1891); M. Barradas, O Infante Dom Henrique\r\n(1894); A. Alves, Dom Henrique o Infante (1894); J. E. Wappaus,\r\nUntersuchungen uber... Heinrich (1842). Two valuable essays, Prince\r\nHenry the Navigator and The Demarcation Line of Pope Alexander III., by\r\nE. G. Bourne, are republished in his Essays in Historical Criticism\r\n(1901).\r\n\r\nThe most important original source for the early exorations of the\r\nPortuguese is Gomes Eannes de Azurara, Chronicle of the Discovery and\r\nConquest of Guinea (2 vols., Hakluyt Society, 1896 and 1899). The\r\nvoyages of Cadamosto are published by the Hakluyt Society. Long\r\nextracts from the accounts of the voyages of Diego Gomez are given in\r\nC. R. Beazley, Prince Henry, 289-298, and in R. H. Major, Prince Henry,\r\n288-298. A number of original documents illustrative of this period are\r\ncontained in Alguns Documentos do Archivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo\r\nAcerca das Navagacoes e Conquistas Portuguezas (1892). An account of\r\nthe latest stages of the Portuguese advance to India is given in F. C.\r\nDanvers, The Portuguese in India (1894). An almost contemporary account\r\nof the explorations is J. Barros, Decadas da Asia (first published\r\n1552, etc.); the first five books have been translated into German by\r\nE. Feust (1844).\r\n\r\nSPAIN IN THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\nThe great collection of sources for the history of Spain is the\r\nColeccion de Documentos Ineditos para la Historia de Espana (112 vols.,\r\n1842-1895). Matters more particularly relating to the subjects of this\r\nbook appear in vols. I., III., VI., XIII., XIX., XXIV., XXVIII.,\r\nXXXIX., and LI. The proceedings of the cortes are published by the\r\nAcademia de la Historia, Cortes de los Antiguos Reinos de Leon y de\r\nCastilla (4 vols., 1861-1884). The records of those called by Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella are in vol. IV. (1882). A careful analysis and\r\nintroduction to these records is by M. Colmeiro (2 vols., 1883-1884).\r\n\r\nThe three most important chronicles of Spain contemporary with\r\nFerdinand and Isabella are Hernando del Pulgar, Cronica de los Reyes\r\nCatolicos (1780); and Andre Bernaldez, Historia de los Reyes (1878).\r\n\r\nThe institutions of Spain are described in detail in two admirable\r\nworks: J. M. Antequera, Historia de la Legislacion Espanola (1874); and\r\nF. M. Marina, Ensayo Historico-critico sobre la Antigua Legislacion ...\r\nde Leon y Castilla (1834). There is a short but systematic and valuable\r\naccount of Spanish institutions in The Cambridge Modern History (I.,\r\nchap, xi., by H. B. Clarke). The most satisfactory general description\r\nof the changes in Spanish institutions during the reign of the Catholic\r\nsovereigns is J. H. Mariejol, L'Espagne sous Ferdinand et Isabelle: le\r\nGouvernement, les Institutions, et les Moeurs (1892). William H.\r\nPrescott, The Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic (various\r\neditions), is less uncritical in character, and consequently more\r\ntrustworthy, than the other works of this author. An important study of\r\nthe personal character of Isabella is Clemencin, Elogio de la Reina\r\nCatolica, in Real Academia de la Historia, Memorias, IV. An important\r\nand suggestive study of this period is W. Maurenbrecher, Spanien unter\r\nden Katholischen Konigen: Studien und Skizzen zur Geschichte der\r\nReformationszeit (1857). Of somewhat similar character is W. Havemann,\r\nDarstellungen aus der inneren Geschichte Spaniens wahrend des XV., XVI.\r\nund XVII. Jahrhunderts (1850). The more purely political history is\r\nbest given in M. Danvilla y Collado, El Poder Civil en Espana (6 vols.,\r\n1885-1887). The expulsion of the Jews is described in the third volume\r\nof J. Amador de los Rios, Los Judios de Espana y Portugal (3 vols.,\r\n1875-1876); that of the Moriscos in H. C. Lea, The Moriscos of Spain,\r\ntheir Conversion and Expulsion (1901). Much valuable description of\r\nthis period is also given in H. C. Lea, Chapters from the Religious\r\nHistory of Spain (1890). Mr. Lea has also an important article, \"The\r\nPolicy of Spain towards the Indies\" (Yale Review, August, 1899). The\r\nmilitary history of Ferdinand's reign is given in P. Boissonade,\r\nReunion de la Navarre a la Castille (1893), and in the large general\r\nhistories of Spain, such as A. Canovas del Castillo, Historia General\r\nde Espana (1894), and Vicente de la Fuente, Historia General de Espana\r\n(30 vols., 1850-1867).\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Casa da Contractacion is fully described in\r\nPrimeras Ordenanzas ... de la Contractacion de las Indias, by J. de\r\nVeitia Linage (1672, \"made English\" by Captain John Stevens, under the\r\ntitle The Spanish Rule of Trade to the West Indies, 1702). It is also\r\ndescribed in Richard Hakluyt, Principal Navigations, IV. Economic\r\nconditions are further described in two books by K. Habler, Geschichte\r\nder Fugger'schen Handlung in Spanien (1897); Die Wirtschaftliche Blute\r\nSpaniens im XVI. Jahrhundert und ihr Verfall (1888).\r\n\r\nFRANCE IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\nThe great mass of contemporary writings for this period is published\r\npartly in the great Collection de Documents Inedits (about 280 vols.,\r\n1835-), partly in other collections, such as that of Michaud et\r\nPoujoulat, Correspondance D'Orient, 1830-1831 (7 vols., 1835), and\r\npartly as individual publications. The royal enactments down to 1514\r\nare best edited in Ordonnances des Roys de France (21 vols., 1723-\r\n1849). The Recueil General des Anciennes Lois Francaises, edited by\r\nIsambert and Taillandier (29 vols., 1822-1833), extends later in time\r\nbut is inferior in fulness and accuracy.\r\n\r\nA short general history of France during this period is A. J. Grant,\r\nThe French Monarchy, 1483-1789 (2 vols., 1900). Of the excellent work,\r\nLavisse, Histoire de France, the latest section to appear is V., pt.\r\ni., by H. Lemonnier, which covers the period 1492-1547.\r\n\r\nFor the commercial history of France valuable works are H. Pigeonneau,\r\nHistoire du Commerce de la France (2 vols., 1887-1889); Pierre Clement,\r\nHistoire de la Vie et de L'Administration de Colbert (2 vols., 1846);\r\nG. Fagniez, \"Le Commerce de la France sous Henri IV.,\" in Revue\r\nHistorique, May-June, 1881; and F. Bourquelot, Etude sur les Foires de\r\nChampagne (Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres de L'Institut de\r\nFrance, series II., vol. V., 1865). For the commercial companies in\r\nCanada, see H. P. Biggar, Early Trading Companies of New France (1901).\r\n\r\nTHE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\nThe best history of the Netherlands is P. J. Blok, History of the\r\nPeople of the Netherlands (1892, in part translated by Ruth Putnam, 3\r\nvols., 1898-1900); J. L. Motley, Rise of the Dutch Republic (many\r\neditions), still has value and much interest, but the work is\r\nuncritical and based on inadequate study of the sources. C. M. Davies,\r\nHistory of Holland and the Dutch Nation (3 vols., 1851), is of special\r\nvalue for its attention to the internal organization of the Dutch\r\nnation. Robert Fruin, Geschiedniss der Staatsinstellingen in Nederland\r\n(edited by H. T. Colenbrander, 1901), is a much more detailed and\r\nmodern work, the first two books of which refer to the period of this\r\nvolume. In it are to be found abundant references to the sources of\r\nDutch institutions. Douglas Campbell, The Puritan in Holland, England,\r\nand America (2 vols., 1892), is a vivacious work including much\r\ndescription of conditions in Holland and England during this period. It\r\nis, however, written in a spirit of controversial exaggeration which\r\nreduces its historical value to small proportions. The long and\r\nvaluable paper \"William Usselinx,\" by J. P. Jameson (American\r\nHistorical Society, Papers, II., 1888), contains much information\r\nconcerning political and commercial conditions in the Netherlands.\r\nThere is a short description of the municipal organization of Holland\r\nin an article by J. F. Jameson in the Magazine of American History,\r\nVIII., 315-330. The charter of the Dutch West India Company is in E. B.\r\nO'Callaghan, History of New Netherland, I., App. A (1855); and in\r\nSamuel Hazard, State Papers, I.\r\n\r\nThe general history of Germany for this period can be Studied from the\r\nfollowing volumes of the series entitled Allgemeine Geschichte in\r\nEinzeldarstellungen--viz., F. von Bezold, Geschichte der deutschen\r\nReformation (1890); G. Droysen, Geschichte der Gegenreformation (1893);\r\nG. Winter, Der dreissigjahrigen Krieges (1893); B. Erdmannsdorfer,\r\nDeutsche Geschichte von westfalischen Frieden bis Friedrichs der\r\nGrossen (2 vols., 1892). The last work contains in its first book a\r\nvaluable resume of the results of the Thirty Years' War and the\r\ncondition of Germany at the time. E. Armstrong, The Emperor Charles V.\r\n(2 vols., 1902), is an excellent account of Germany during the middle\r\nyears of the sixteenth century. Anton Gindely, The Thirty Years' War\r\n(English translation, 2 vols., 1884), is a standard work on the Thirty\r\nYears' War.\r\n\r\nThe religious changes of the time are described in a scholarly but\r\nextremely dry fashion in W. Moeller, History of the Christian Church,\r\nIII. (English translation, 1900). L. von Ranke, Deutsche Geschichte im\r\nZeitalter der Reformation, translated into English (3 vols., 1845-\r\n1847), is a well-known work. More detailed accounts of the Anabaptists\r\nare given in H. W. Erbkam, Geschichte der Protestantischen Sekten in\r\nZeitalter der Reformation (1848); L. Keller, Geschichte der\r\nWiedertaufer (1880); and Max Goebel, Geschichte des Christlichen Leben\r\nin der rheinschwestphdlischen evangelischen Kirche (3 vols., 1849-\r\n1860).\r\n\r\nENGLAND IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.--The standard bibliographical guide in early English\r\nhistory is Charles Gross, Sources and Literature of English History\r\nfrom the Earliest Times to about 1485 (1900).\r\n\r\nGENERAL WORKS.--The best general history of the reign of Henry VII. is\r\nW. Busch, England under the Tudors (I., Henry VII., 1895); on the early\r\npart of the reign of Henry VIII., J. S. Brewer, The Reign of Henry\r\nVIII. (2 vols., 1884); J. A. Froude, History of England from the Fall\r\nof Wolsey to the Defeat of the Armada (12 vols., 1856-1870).\r\nNotwithstanding the criticism to which this work has been subjected it\r\nremains the most detailed, serious, and valuable history of England in\r\nthe sixteenth century. A. F. Pollard, England under Protector Somerset\r\n(1900), is a valuable survey of the period 1547-1551. S. R. Gardiner,\r\nHistory of England from 1603 to 1642 (10 vols., 1883-1884), History of\r\nthe Great Civil War, 1642-1649 (4 vols., 1886-1891), and History of the\r\nCommonwealth and Protectorate (3 vols., 1894-1903), form a series of\r\ngreat value, covering more than half of the seventeenth century. Henry\r\nHallam, Constitutional History of England (3 vols., 1829), is\r\nserviceable. L. O. Pike, Constitutional History of the House of Lords\r\n(1894), and A. V. Dicey, The Privy Council (1895), are valuable\r\nmonographs.\r\n\r\nSOURCES.--The sources for English history during this period are to be\r\nfound principally in the Acts of the Privy Council (in progress 1890-),\r\nCalendars of State Papers (about 300 vols.), Statutes of the Realm,\r\n1235-1713 (11 vols.), Journals of the House of Lords (16 vols. to\r\n1700), Journals of the House of Commons (13 vols. to 1700), Sir S.\r\nD'Ewes, Journals of the Period of Elizabeth (1682), J. Rushworth,\r\nHistorical Collections (1703), Historical Manuscripts Commission,\r\nReports (106 parts), Deputy Keeper of the Rolls, Public Records,\r\nReports (64 vols.), and in a vast number of detached publications of\r\ncontemporary journals, correspondence, etc.\r\n\r\nMany of the most important statutes and other state papers are\r\ncollected in G. W. Prothero, Select Statutes and other Constitutional\r\nDocuments of the Reigns of Elizabeth and James I., 1559-1625 (1894),\r\nand S. R. Gardiner, Constitutional Documents of the Puritan Revolution,\r\n1628-1660 (1889). Each of these collections has an admirable\r\nintroduction discussing the history and institutions of the period.\r\nOther collections illustrating the constitutional history of the time\r\nare George B. Adams and H. Morse Stephens, Select Documents of English\r\nConstitutional History (1901); and Mabel Hill, Liberty Documents\r\n(1901). The following collections of sources also illustrate social\r\nconditions: C. W. Colby, Selections from the Sources of English History\r\n(1899); Elizabeth K. Kendall, Source-Book of English History (1900);\r\nErnest P. Henderson, Side-Lights on English History (1900).\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL HISTORY.--The Merchants Adventurers are discussed and\r\nillustrated in W. E. Lingelbach, Laws and Ordinances of the Merchant\r\nAdventurers (1902), and The Internal Organization of the Merchant\r\nAdventurers (1902); in G. Schanz, Englische Handelspolitik (2 vols.,\r\n1881); Richard Ehrenberg, England and Hamburg (1896); and Charles\r\nGross, The Gild Merchant (2 vols., 1890). The commercial companies\r\ngenerally are described in Cawston and Keane, The Early English\r\nChartered Companies (1896), a book of slight value and limited extent\r\nof information apart from the fact that it is practically the only work\r\ncovering the field. David Macpherson, Annals of Commerce (4 vols.,\r\n1802), is a book of old-fashioned learning on the subject. For the East\r\nIndia Company there is a large literature. Some of the sources are The\r\nCharters of the East India Company (no date or place of publication);\r\nBirdwood and Foster, The First Letter Book of the East India Company,\r\n1600-1619 (1893); Henry Stevens, Dawn of British Trade to the East\r\nIndies (1886). Of more general histories the most recent and one of the\r\nbest is Beckles Wilson, Ledger and Sword (1903).\r\n\r\nEvents in England affecting the early history of Virginia are related\r\nand the original papers given in Alexander Brown, Genesis of the United\r\nStates (2 vols., 1891). Valuable articles by H. L. Osgood bearing on\r\nthis general subject are: \"England and the Colonies\" (Political Science\r\nQuarterly, II.); \"Political Ideas of the Puritans\" (ibid., VI., Nos. 1,\r\n2); and \"The Colonial Corporation\" (ibid., XI., Nos. 2, 3). See also\r\nhis American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century (2 vols., 1904). On\r\ngeneral commercial conditions, William Cunningham, Growth of English\r\nIndustry and Commerce (revised ed., 1904).\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS HISTORY.--W. E. Griffis, The Pilgrims in their Three Homes\r\n(1898); Daniel Neal, History of the Puritans (4 vols., 1732-1738); W.\r\nA. Shaw, The English Church During the Commonwealth (1900); E.\r\nEggleston, Beginners of a Nation (1897), gives interesting and\r\nunfamiliar details of the religious sects in England. A. B. Hinds, The\r\nEngland of Elizabeth (1895), is a careful study of the origins of\r\nEnglish Puritanism on the Continent. G. P. Gooch, English Democratic\r\nIdeas in the Seventeenth Century (1898), throws light on the various\r\nsects. William Sewel, History of the Quakers (1725), is a standard\r\nhistory on the origin of that body.\r\n\r\nC. G. Walpole, The Kingdom of Ireland (1882), describes the \"Plantation\r\nof Ulster\" and the conditions that led to the emigration of the Scotch-\r\nIrish. Of value also are W. E. H. Lecky, England in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury (8 vols., 1878-1890); J. P. Prendergast, The Cromwellian\r\nSettlement of Ireland (1865); and H. Green, The Scotch-Irish in America\r\n(1895).\r\n\r\nENGLISH LOCAL GOVERNMENT.--For local government the admirable\r\nbibliography is Charles Gross, Bibliography of British Municipal\r\nHistory, Including Gilds and Parliamentary Representatives (Harvard\r\nHistorical Studies, V., 1897). Contemporary legal treatises concerning\r\ncounty government are Michael Dalton, Officium Vicecomitum, or the\r\nOffice and Authority of Sheriffs (1623), and The Country Justice\r\n(1681); William Greenwood, Authority, Jurisdiction, and Method of\r\nKeeping County Courts, Courts-Leet, and Courts-Baron, etc. (1659);\r\nWilliam Lambarde, Eirenarcha, or the Office of the Justices of Peace\r\n(1588); A. Fitzherbert, L'Office et Authorities de Justices de Peace\r\n(1514), often quoted as \"Crompton\", an editor who enlarged the original\r\nwork in 1583; John Wilkinson, Office and Authority of Coroners and\r\nSheriffs (1628). All these appear in numerous editions, the above dates\r\nbeing, as far as ascertained, those of the earliest editions.\r\n\r\nFew records of county government exist to any large extent, and very\r\nfew have been printed. Among them are three bodies of quarter-sessions\r\nrecords. John Lister, West Riding Sessions Rolls, 1597-1602 (Yorkshire\r\nArchaeological and Topographical Association, Records Series, III.,\r\n1888); J. C. Jeaffreson, Middlesex County Records, 1549-1608 (Middlesex\r\nCounty Records Society, 1886-1892); Ernest Axon, in Record Society of\r\nLancaster and Cheshire, Manchester Sessions, XLII. Some material for\r\nWiltshire and Worcestershire is published in the Historical Manuscripts\r\nCommission, Reports, VI., VII.\r\n\r\nA. H. A. Hamilton, Quarter-Sessions ... chiefly of Devon (1878),\r\ncontains much on the subject. E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the\r\nEnglish Poor Relief (1900), is a scholarly study involving much\r\ndescription of local administration and the central and local\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nFor the parish, Richard Burn, Ecclesiastical Law (2 vols., 1763);\r\nWilliam Sheppard, Offices and Duties of Constables, Borsholders,\r\nTythingmen, etc. (1641); William Lambarde, Duties of Church-wardens and\r\nDuties of Constables, affixed to his Eirenarcha (1581); George Meriton,\r\nDuties of Constables (1669). For the actual life of the parish,\r\nrecourse must be had to the few bodies of such records that are printed\r\nseparately or in local histories. Some of these are as follows: J. L.\r\nGlasscock, Records of St. Michael's Church (1882); Collyer and Turner,\r\nIlkley, Ancient and Modern (1885); W. T. Woodbridge, Rushbrook Parish\r\nRegisters (1903); W. O. Massingberd, History of Ormsby (1893); J. P.\r\nEarwaker, Constables' Accounts of Manchester (3 vols., 1891-1892); John\r\nNichols, Illustration of the Manners, etc., of England from Accounts of\r\nChurch-wardens (1797).\r\n\r\nThe book that has exerted the most influence on opinion on this subject\r\nis Toulmin Smith, The Parish (1854). It is, however, written in a\r\nspirit of controversy, many of its interpretations of the statutes are\r\nquite incorrect, and it must, therefore, be used with great caution.\r\nIts most valuable contents are its references to sources, and extracts\r\nfrom local records. Rudolf Gneist, Self-Government, Communalverfassung\r\nund Verwaltungsgeschichte in England (1871), is almost the sole work\r\ncovering the whole subject, but it is quite unsatisfactory, being drawn\r\nfrom a comparatively small group of sources. George E. Howard, Local\r\nConstitutional History of the United States (Johns Hopkins University\r\nStudies, extra vol. IV., 1889), and The Development of the King's Peace\r\n(Nebraska University Studies, I., 1890); Edward Channing, Town and\r\nCounty Government in the English Colonies of North America (Johns\r\nHopkins University Studies, II., No. 10), and some other articles by\r\nHerbert B. Adams and others in the same series, include considerable\r\ninformation on local conditions in England, though their primary\r\nreference is to America.\r\n\r\n[Proofer's note: Index omitted.]\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.
