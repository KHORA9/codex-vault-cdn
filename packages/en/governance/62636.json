The People that Sit\r\nin Darkness are getting to be too scarce—too scarce and too shy. And\r\nsuch darkness as is now left is really of but an indifferent quality,\r\nand not dark enough for the game. The most of those People that Sit in\r\nDarkness have been furnished with more light than was good for them or\r\nprofitable for us. We have been injudicious.\r\n\r\nThe Blessings-of-Civilization Trust, wisely and cautiously administered,\r\nis a Daisy. There is more money in it, more territory, more sovereignty\r\nand other kinds of emolument, than there is in any other game that is\r\nplayed. But Christendom has been playing it badly of late years, and\r\nmust certainly suffer by it, in my opinion. She has been so eager to get\r\nevery stake that appeared on the green cloth, that the People who Sit in\r\nDarkness have noticed it—they have noticed it, and have begun to show\r\nalarm. They have become suspicious of the Blessings of Civilization.\r\nMore—they have begun to examine them. This is not well. The Blessings of\r\nCivilization are all right, and a good commercial property; there could\r\nnot be a better, in a dim light. In the right kind of a light, and at a\r\nproper distance, with the goods a little out of focus, they furnish this\r\ndesirable exhibit to the Gentlemen who Sit in Darkness:\r\n\r\nLOVE, JUSTICE, GENTLENESS, CHRISTIANITY, PROTECTION TO THE WEAK,\r\nTEMPERANCE, LAW AND ORDER, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, HONORABLE DEALING, MERCY,\r\nEDUCATION,\r\n\r\n—and so on.\r\n\r\nThere. Is it good? Sir, it is pie. It will bring into camp any idiot\r\nthat sits in darkness anywhere. But not if we adulterate it. It is\r\nproper to be emphatic upon that point. This brand is strictly for\r\nExport—apparently. Apparently. Privately and confidentially, it is\r\nnothing of the kind. Privately and confidentially, it is merely an\r\noutside cover, gay and pretty and attractive, displaying the special\r\npatterns of our Civilization which we reserve for Home Consumption,\r\nwhile inside the bale is the Actual Thing that the Customer Sitting in\r\nDarkness buys with his blood and tears and land and liberty. That Actual\r\nThing is, indeed, Civilization, but it is only for Export. Is there a\r\ndifference between the two brands? In some of the details, yes.\r\n\r\nWe all know that the Business is being ruined. The reason is not far to\r\nseek. It is because our Mr. McKinley, and Mr. Chamberlain, and the\r\nKaiser, and the Czar, and the French have been exporting the Actual\r\nThing with the outside cover left off. This is bad for the Game. It\r\nshows that these new players of it are not sufficiently acquainted with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is a distress to look on and note the mismoves, they are so strange\r\nand so awkward. Mr. Chamberlain manufactures a war out of materials so\r\ninadequate and so fanciful that they make the boxes grieve and the\r\ngallery laugh, and he tries hard to persuade himself that it isn’t\r\npurely a private raid for cash, but has a sort of dim, vague\r\nrespectability about it somewhere, if he could only find the spot; and\r\nthat, by and by, he can scour the flag clean again after he has finished\r\ndragging it through the mud, and make it shine and flash in the vault of\r\nheaven once more as it had shone and flashed there a thousand years in\r\nthe world’s respect until he laid his unfaithful hand upon it. It is bad\r\nplay—bad. For it exposes the Actual Thing to Them that Sit in Darkness,\r\nand they say: “What! Christian against Christian? And only for money? Is\r\nthis a case of magnanimity, forbearance, love, gentleness, mercy,\r\nprotection of the weak—this strange and over-showy onslaught of an\r\nelephant upon a nest of field-mice, on the pretext that the mice had\r\nsqueaked an insolence at him—conduct which ‘no self-respecting\r\ngovernment could allow to pass unavenged?’ as Mr. Chamberlain said. Was\r\nthat a good pretext in a small case, when it had not been a good pretext\r\nin a large one?—for only recently Russia had affronted the elephant\r\nthree times and survived alive and unsmitten. Is this Civilization and\r\nProgress? Is it something better than we already possess? These\r\nharryings and burnings and desert-makings in the Transvaal—is this an\r\nimprovement on our darkness? Is it, perhaps, possible that there are two\r\nkinds of Civilization—one for home consumption and one for the heathen\r\nmarket?”\r\n\r\nThen They that Sit in Darkness are troubled, and shake their heads; and\r\nthey read this extract from a letter of a British private, recounting\r\nhis exploits in one of Methuen’s victories, some days before the affair\r\nof Magersfontein, and they are troubled again:\r\n\r\n  “We tore up the hill and into the intrenchments, and the Boers saw\r\n  we had them; so they dropped their guns and went down on their knees\r\n  and put up their hands clasped, and begged for mercy. And we gave it\r\n  them—_with the long spoon_.”\r\n\r\nThe long spoon is the bayonet. See _Lloyd’s Weekly_, London, of those\r\ndays. The same number—and the same column—contains some quite\r\nunconscious satire in the form of shocked and bitter upbraidings of the\r\nBoers for their brutalities and inhumanities!\r\n\r\nNext to our heavy damage, the Kaiser went to playing the game without\r\nfirst mastering it. He lost a couple of missionaries in a riot in\r\nShantung, and in his account he made an overcharge for them. China had\r\nto pay a hundred thousand dollars apiece for them, in money; twelve\r\nmiles of territory, containing several millions of inhabitants and worth\r\ntwenty million dollars, and to build a monument and also a Christian\r\nChurch; whereas the people of China could have been depended upon to\r\nremember the missionaries without the help of these expensive memorials.\r\nThis was all bad play. Bad, because it would not, and could not, and\r\nwill not now or ever, deceive the Person Sitting in Darkness. He knows\r\nthat it was an overcharge. He knows that a missionary is like any other\r\nman; he is worth merely what you can supply his place for, and no more.\r\nHe is useful, but so is a doctor, so is a sheriff, so is an editor; but\r\na just Emperor does not charge war-prices for such. A diligent,\r\nintelligent, but obscure missionary, and a diligent, intelligent country\r\neditor are worth much, and we know it; but they are not worth the earth.\r\nWe esteem such an editor, and we are sorry to see him go; but, when he\r\ngoes, we should consider twelve miles of territory, and a church, and a\r\nfortune, over-compensation for his loss. I mean, if he was a Chinese\r\neditor, and we had to settle for him. It is no proper figure for an\r\neditor or a missionary; one can get shop-worn kings for less. It was bad\r\nplay on the Kaiser’s part. It got this property, true; but it _produced\r\nthe Chinese revolt_, the indignant uprising of China’s traduced\r\npatriots, the Boxers. The results have been expensive to Germany, and to\r\nthe other Disseminators of Progress and the Blessings of Civilization.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser’s claim was paid, yet it was bad play, for it could not fail\r\nto have an evil effect upon Persons Sitting in Darkness in China. They\r\nwould muse upon the event, and be likely to say: “Civilization is\r\ngracious and beautiful, for such is its reputation; but can we afford\r\nit? There are rich Chinamen, perhaps they could afford it; but this tax\r\nis not laid upon them, it is laid upon the peasants of Shantung; it is\r\nthey that must pay this mighty sum, and their wages are but four cents a\r\nday. Is this a better civilization than ours, and holier and higher and\r\nnobler? Is not this rapacity? Is not this extortion? Would Germany\r\ncharge America two hundred thousand dollars for two missionaries, and\r\nshake the mailed fist in her face, and send warships, and send soldiers,\r\nand say: ‘Seize twelve miles of territory, worth twenty millions of\r\ndollars, as additional pay for the missionaries; and make those peasants\r\nbuild a monument to the missionaries, and a costly Christian church to\r\nremember them by?’ And later would Germany say to her soldiers: ‘March\r\nthrough America and slay, _giving no quarter_; make the German face\r\nthere, as has been our Hun-face here, a terror for a thousand years;\r\nmarch through the Great Republic and slay, slay, slay, carving a road\r\nfor our offended religion through its heart and bowels?’ Would Germany\r\ndo like this to America, to England, to France, to Russia? Or only to\r\nChina the helpless—imitating the elephant’s assault upon the field-mice?\r\nHad we better invest in this Civilization—this Civilization which called\r\nNapoleon a buccaneer for carrying off Venice’s bronze horses, but which\r\nsteals our ancient astronomical instruments from our walls, and goes\r\nlooting like common bandits—that is, all the alien soldiers except\r\nAmerica’s; and (Americans again excepted) storms frightened villages and\r\ncables the result to glad journals at home every day: ‘Chinese losses,\r\n450 killed; ours, _one officer and two men wounded_. Shall proceed\r\nagainst neighboring village to-morrow, where a _massacre_ is reported.’\r\nCan we afford Civilization?”\r\n\r\nAnd, next, Russia must go and play the game injudiciously. She affronts\r\nEngland once or twice—with the Person Sitting in Darkness observing and\r\nnoting; by moral assistance of France and Germany, she robs Japan of her\r\nhard-earned spoil, all swimming in Chinese blood—Port Arthur—with the\r\nPerson again observing and noting; then she seizes Manchuria, raids its\r\nvillages, and chokes its great rivers with the swollen corpses of\r\ncountless massacred peasants—that astonished Person still observing and\r\nnoting. And perhaps he is saying to himself: “It is yet _another_\r\nCivilized Power, with its banner of the Prince of Peace in one hand and\r\nits loot-basket and its butcher-knife in the other. Is there no\r\nsalvation for us but to adopt Civilization and lift ourselves down to\r\nits level?”\r\n\r\nAnd by and by comes America, and our Master of the Game plays it\r\nbadly—plays it as Mr. Chamberlain was playing it in South Africa. It was\r\na mistake to do that; also, it was one which was quite unlooked for in a\r\nMaster who was playing it so well in Cuba. In Cuba, he was playing the\r\nusual and regular _American_ game, and it was winning, for there is no\r\nway to beat it. The Master, contemplating Cuba, said: “Here is an\r\noppressed and friendless little nation which is willing to fight to be\r\nfree; we go partners, and put up the strength of seventy million\r\nsympathizers, and the resources of the United States: play!” Nothing but\r\nEurope combined could call that hand: and Europe cannot combine on\r\nanything. There, in Cuba, he was following our great traditions in a way\r\nwhich made us very proud of him, and proud of the deep dissatisfaction\r\nwhich his play was provoking in Continental Europe. Moved by a high\r\ninspiration, he threw out those stirring words which proclaimed that\r\nforcible annexation would be “criminal aggression;” and in that\r\nutterance fired another “shot heard round the world.” The memory of that\r\nfine saying will be outlived by the remembrance of no act of his but\r\none—that he forgot it within the twelvemonth, and its honorable gospel\r\nalong with it.\r\n\r\nFor, presently, came the Philippine temptation. It was strong; it was\r\ntoo strong, and he made that bad mistake: he played the European game,\r\nthe Chamberlain game. It was a pity; it was a great pity, that error;\r\nthat one grievous error, that irrevocable error. For it was the very\r\nplace and time to play the American game again. And at no cost. Rich\r\nwinnings to be gathered in, too; rich and permanent; indestructible; a\r\nfortune transmissible forever to the children of the flag. Not land, not\r\nmoney, not dominion—no, something worth many times more than that dross:\r\nour share, the spectacle of a nation of long harassed and persecuted\r\nslaves set free through our influence; our posterity’s share, the golden\r\nmemory of that fair deed. The game was in our hands. If it had been\r\nplayed according to the American rules, Dewey would have sailed away\r\nfrom Manila as soon as he had destroyed the Spanish fleet—after putting\r\nup a sign on shore guaranteeing foreign property and life against damage\r\nby the Filipinos, and warning the Powers that interference with the\r\nemancipated patriots would be regarded as an act unfriendly to the\r\nUnited States. The Powers cannot combine, in even a bad cause, and the\r\nsign would not have been molested.\r\n\r\nDewey could have gone about his affairs elsewhere, and left the\r\ncompetent Filipino army to starve out the little Spanish garrison and\r\nsend it home, and the Filipino citizens to set up the form of government\r\nthey might prefer, and deal with the friars and their doubtful\r\nacquisitions according to Filipino ideas of fairness and justice—ideas\r\nwhich have since been tested and found to be of as high an order as any\r\nthat prevail in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nBut we played the Chamberlain game, and lost the chance to add another\r\nCuba and another honorable deed to our good record.\r\n\r\nThe more we examine the mistake, the more clearly we perceive that it is\r\ngoing to be bad for the Business. The Person Sitting in Darkness is\r\nalmost sure to say: “There is something curious about this—curious and\r\nunaccountable. There must be two Americas: one that sets the captive\r\nfree, and one that takes a once-captive’s new freedom away from him, and\r\npicks a quarrel with him with nothing to found it on; then kills him to\r\nget his land.”\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the Person Sitting in Darkness is saying things like that;\r\nand for the sake of the Business we must persuade him to look at the\r\nPhilippine matter in another and healthier way. We must arrange his\r\nopinions for him. I believe it can be done; for Mr. Chamberlain has\r\narranged England’s opinion of the South African matter, and done it most\r\ncleverly and successfully. He presented the facts—some of the facts—and\r\nshowed those confiding people what the facts meant. He did it\r\nstatistically, which is a good way. He used the formula: “Twice 2 are\r\n14, and 2 from 9 leaves 35.” Figures are effective; figures will\r\nconvince the elect.\r\n\r\nNow, my plan is a still bolder one than Mr. Chamberlain’s, though\r\napparently a copy of it. Let us be franker than Mr. Chamberlain; let us\r\naudaciously present the whole of the facts, shirking none, then explain\r\nthem according to Mr. Chamberlain’s formula. This daring truthfulness\r\nwill astonish and dazzle the Person Sitting in Darkness, and he will\r\ntake the Explanation down before his mental vision has had time to get\r\nback into focus. Let us say to him:\r\n\r\n“Our case is simple. On the 1st of May, Dewey destroyed the Spanish\r\nfleet. This left the Archipelago in the hands of its proper and rightful\r\nowners, the Filipino nation. Their army numbered 30,000 men, and they\r\nwere competent to whip out or starve out the little Spanish garrison;\r\nthen the people could set up a government of their own devising. Our\r\ntraditions required that Dewey should now set up his warning sign, and\r\ngo away. But the Master of the Game happened to think of another\r\nplan—the European plan. He acted upon it. This was, to send out an\r\narmy—ostensibly to help the native patriots put the finishing touch upon\r\ntheir long and plucky struggle for independence, but really to take\r\ntheir land away from them and keep it. That is, in the interest of\r\nProgress and Civilization. The plan developed, stage by stage, and quite\r\nsatisfactorily. We entered into a military alliance with the trusting\r\nFilipinos, and they hemmed in Manila on the land side, and by their\r\nvaluable help the place, with its garrison of 8,000 or 10,000 Spaniards,\r\nwas captured—a thing which we could not have accomplished unaided at\r\nthat time. We got their help by—by ingenuity. We knew they were fighting\r\nfor their independence, and that they had been at it for two years. We\r\nknew they supposed that we also were fighting in their worthy cause—just\r\nas we had helped the Cubans fight for Cuban independence—and we allowed\r\nthem to go on thinking so. _Until Manila was ours and we could get along\r\nwithout them._ Then we showed our hand. Of course, they were\r\nsurprised—that was natural; surprised and disappointed; disappointed and\r\ngrieved. To them it looked un-American; un-characteristic; foreign to\r\nour established traditions. And this was natural, too; for we were only\r\nplaying the American Game in public—in private it was the European. It\r\nwas neatly done, very neatly, and it bewildered them so they could not\r\nunderstand it; for we had been so friendly—so affectionate, even—with\r\nthose simple-minded patriots! We, our own selves, had brought back\r\nout of exile their leader, their hero, their hope, their\r\nWashington—Aguinaldo; brought him in a warship, in high honor, under the\r\nsacred shelter and hospitality of the flag; brought him back and\r\nrestored him to his people, and got their moving and eloquent gratitude\r\nfor it. Yes, we had been so friendly to them, and had heartened them up\r\nin so many ways! We had lent them guns and ammunition; advised with\r\nthem; exchanged pleasant courtesies with them; placed our sick and\r\nwounded in their kindly care; entrusted our Spanish prisoners to their\r\nhumane and honest hands; fought shoulder to shoulder with them against\r\n“the common enemy” (our own phrase); praised their courage, praised\r\ntheir gallantry, praised their mercifulness, praised their fine and\r\nhonorable conduct; borrowed their trenches, borrowed strong positions\r\nwhich they had previously captured from the Spaniards; petted them, lied\r\nto them—officially proclaiming that our land and naval forces came to\r\ngive them their freedom and displace the bad Spanish Government—fooled\r\nthem, used them until we needed them no longer; then derided the sucked\r\norange and threw it away. We kept the positions which we had beguiled\r\nthem of; by and by, we moved a force forward and overlapped patriot\r\nground—a clever thought, for we needed trouble, and this would produce\r\nit. A Filipino soldier, crossing the ground, where no one had a right to\r\nforbid him, was shot by our sentry. The badgered patriots resented this\r\nwith arms, without waiting to know whether Aguinaldo, who was absent,\r\nwould approve or not. Aguinaldo did not approve; but that availed\r\nnothing. What we wanted, in the interest of Progress and Civilization,\r\nwas the Archipelago, unencumbered by patriots struggling for\r\nindependence; and the War was what we needed. We clinched our\r\nopportunity. It is Mr. Chamberlain’s case over again—at least in its\r\nmotive and intention; and we played the game as adroitly as he played it\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nAt this point in our frank statement of fact to the Person Sitting in\r\nDarkness, we should throw in a little trade-taffy about the Blessings of\r\nCivilization—for a change, and for the refreshment of his spirit—then go\r\non with our tale:\r\n\r\n“We and the patriots having captured Manila, Spain’s ownership\r\nof the Archipelago and her sovereignty over it were at an\r\nend—obliterated—annihilated—not a rag or shred of either remaining\r\nbehind. It was then that we conceived the divinely humorous idea of\r\n_buying_ both of these spectres from Spain! [It is quite safe to confess\r\nthis to the Person Sitting in Darkness, since neither he nor any other\r\nsane person will believe it.] In buying those ghosts for twenty\r\nmillions, we also contracted to take care of the friars and their\r\naccumulations. I think we also agreed to propagate leprosy and smallpox,\r\nbut as to this there is doubt. But it is not important; persons\r\nafflicted with the friars do not mind the other diseases.\r\n\r\n“With our treaty ratified, Manila subdued, and our Ghosts secured, we\r\nhad no further use for Aguinaldo and the owners of the Archipelago. We\r\nforced a war, and we have been hunting America’s guest and ally through\r\nthe woods and swamps ever since.”\r\n\r\nAt this point in the tale, it will be well to boast a little of our\r\nwar-work and our heroisms in the field, so as to make our performance\r\nlook as fine as England’s in South Africa; but I believe it will not be\r\nbest to emphasize this too much. We must be cautious. Of course, we must\r\nread the war-telegrams to the Person, in order to keep up our frankness;\r\nbut we can throw an air of humorousness over them, and that will modify\r\ntheir grim eloquence a little, and their rather indiscreet exhibitions\r\nof gory exultation. Before reading to him the following display heads of\r\nthe dispatches of November 18, 1900, it will be well to practice on them\r\nin private first, so as to get the right tang of lightness and gaiety\r\ninto them:\r\n\r\n           “ADMINISTRATION WEARY OF PROTRACTED HOSTILITIES!”\r\n\r\n                “REAL WAR AHEAD FOR FILIPINO REBELS!”[1]\r\n\r\n                         “WILL SHOW NO MERCY!”\r\n\r\n                      “KITCHENER’S PLAN ADOPTED!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  “Rebels!” Mumble that funny word—don’t let the Person catch it\r\n  distinctly.\r\n\r\nKitchener knows how to handle disagreeable people who are fighting for\r\ntheir homes and their liberties, and we must let on that we are merely\r\nimitating Kitchener, and have no national interest in the matter,\r\nfurther than to get ourselves admired by the Great Family of Nations, in\r\nwhich august company our Master of the Game has bought a place for us in\r\nthe back row.\r\n\r\nOf course, we must not venture to ignore our General MacArthur’s\r\nreports—oh, why do they keep on printing those embarrassing things?—we\r\nmust drop them trippingly from the tongue and take the chances:\r\n\r\n“During the last ten months our losses have been 268 killed and 750\r\nwounded; Filipino loss, _three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven\r\nkilled_, and 694 wounded.”\r\n\r\nWe must stand ready to grab the Person Sitting in Darkness, for he will\r\nswoon away at this confession, saying: “Good God, those ‘niggers’ spare\r\ntheir wounded, and the Americans massacre theirs!”\r\n\r\nWe must bring him to, and coax him and coddle him, and assure him that\r\nthe ways of Providence are best, and that it would not become us to find\r\nfault with them; and then, to show him that we are only imitators, not\r\noriginators, we must read the following passage from the letter of an\r\nAmerican soldier-lad in the Philippines to his mother, published in\r\n_Public Opinion_, of Decorah, Iowa, describing the finish of a\r\nvictorious battle:\r\n\r\n“WE NEVER LEFT ONE ALIVE. IF ONE WAS WOUNDED, WE WOULD RUN OUR BAYONETS\r\nTHROUGH HIM.”\r\n\r\nHaving now laid all the historical facts before the Person Sitting in\r\nDarkness, we should bring him to again, and explain them to him. We\r\nshould say to him:\r\n\r\n“They look doubtful, but in reality they are not. There have been\r\nlies; yes, but they were told in a good cause. We have been\r\ntreacherous; but that was only in order that real good might come out\r\nof apparent evil. True, we have crushed a deceived and confiding\r\npeople; we have turned against the weak and the friendless who trusted\r\nus; we have stamped out a just and intelligent and well-ordered\r\nrepublic; we have stabbed an ally in the back and slapped the face of\r\na guest; we have bought a Shadow from an enemy that hadn’t it to sell;\r\nwe have robbed a trusting friend of his land and his liberty; we have\r\ninvited our clean young men to shoulder a discredited musket and do\r\nbandit’s work under a flag which bandits have been accustomed to fear,\r\nnot to follow; we have debauched America’s honor and blackened her\r\nface before the world; but each detail was for the best. We know this.\r\nThe Head of every State and Sovereignty in Christendom and ninety per\r\ncent. of every legislative body in Christendom, including our Congress\r\nand our fifty State Legislatures, are members not only of the church,\r\nbut also of the Blessings-of-Civilization Trust. This world-girdling\r\naccumulation of trained morals, high principles, and justice, cannot\r\ndo an unright thing, an unfair thing, an ungenerous thing, an unclean\r\nthing. It knows what it is about. Give yourself no uneasiness; it is\r\nall right.”\r\n\r\nNow then, that will convince the Person. You will see. It will restore\r\nthe Business. Also, it will elect the Master of the Game to the vacant\r\nplace in the Trinity of our national gods; and there on their high\r\nthrones the Three will sit, age after age, in the people’s sight, each\r\nbearing the Emblem of his service: Washington, the Sword of the\r\nLiberator; Lincoln, the Slave’s Broken Chains; the Master, the Chains\r\nRepaired.\r\n\r\nIt will give the Business a splendid new start. You will see.\r\n\r\nEverything is prosperous, now; everything is just as we should wish it.\r\nWe have got the Archipelago, and we shall never give it up. Also, we\r\nhave every reason to hope that we shall have an opportunity before very\r\nlong to slip out of our Congressional contract with Cuba and give her\r\nsomething better in the place of it. It is a rich country, and many of\r\nus are already beginning to see that the contract was a sentimental\r\nmistake. But now—right now—is the best time to do some profitable\r\nrehabilitating work—work that will set us up and make us comfortable,\r\nand discourage gossip. We cannot conceal from ourselves that, privately,\r\nwe are a little troubled about our uniform. It is one of our prides; it\r\nis acquainted with honor; it is familiar with great deeds and noble; we\r\nlove it, we revere it; and so this errand it is on makes us uneasy. And\r\nour flag—another pride of ours, our chiefest! We have worshipped it so;\r\nand when we have seen it in far lands—glimpsing it unexpectedly in that\r\nstrange sky, waving its welcome and benediction to us—we have caught our\r\nbreath and uncovered our heads, and couldn’t speak, for a moment, for\r\nthe thought of what it was to us and the great ideals it stood for.\r\nIndeed, we _must_ do something about these things: we must not have the\r\nflag out there, and the uniform. They are not needed there; we can\r\nmanage in some other way. England manages, as regards the uniform, and\r\nso can we. We have to send soldiers—we can’t get out of that—but we can\r\ndisguise them. It is the way England does in South Africa. Even Mr.\r\nChamberlain himself takes pride in England’s honorable uniform, and\r\nmakes the army down there wear an ugly and odious and appropriate\r\ndisguise, of yellow stuff such as quarantine flags are made of, and\r\nwhich are hoisted to warn the healthy away from unclean disease and\r\nrepulsive death. This cloth is called khaki. We could adopt it. It is\r\nlight, comfortable, grotesque, and deceives the enemy, for he cannot\r\nconceive of a soldier being concealed in it.\r\n\r\nAnd as for a flag for the Philippine Province, it is easily managed. We\r\ncan have a special one—our States do it: we can have just our usual\r\nflag, with the white stripes painted black and the stars replaced by the\r\nskull and cross-bones.\r\n\r\nAnd we do not need that Civil Commission out there. Having no powers, it\r\nhas to invent them, and that kind of work cannot be effectively done by\r\njust anybody; an expert is required. Mr. Croker can be spared. We do not\r\nwant the United States represented there, but only the Game.\r\n\r\nBy help of these suggested amendments, Progress and Civilization in that\r\ncountry can have a boom, and it will take in the Persons who are Sitting\r\nin Darkness, and we can resume Business at the old stand.\r\n\r\n                                                             MARK TWAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor copies, address the Anti-Imperialist League of New York, 150 Nassau\r\nSt., Room 1520.
