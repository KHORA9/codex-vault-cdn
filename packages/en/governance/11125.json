  "content": "A COMPILATION OF THE MESSAGES AND PAPERS OF THE PRESIDENTS\r\n\r\nBY JAMES D. RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1853, to March 4, 1857\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin Pierce was born in Hillsboro, N.H., November 23, 1804. Was\r\nthe fourth son of Benjamin and Anna Pierce. His father was a citizen of\r\nMassachusetts; was a soldier in the War of the Revolution, attaining the\r\nrank of captain and brevet major. After peace was declared he removed\r\nfrom Massachusetts to New Hampshire and located near what is now\r\nHillsboro. His first wife was Elizabeth Andrews, who died at an early\r\nage. His second wife, the mother of Franklin Pierce, was Anna Kendrick,\r\nof Amherst, N.H. He was sheriff of his county, a member of the State\r\nlegislature and of the governor's council, and was twice chosen governor\r\nof his State (as a Democrat), first in 1827 and again in 1829, For many\r\nyears he was declared to be \"the most influential man in New Hampshire,\"\r\nHe died in 1839. Franklin was given an academic education in well-known\r\ninstitutions at Hancock, Francestown, and Exeter, and in 1820 was sent\r\nto Bowdoin College, His college mates there were John P. Hale, his\r\nfuture political rival; Professor Calvin E. Stowe; Sergeant S. Prentiss,\r\nthe distinguished orator; Henry W. Longfellow, and Nathaniel Hawthorne,\r\nhis future biographer and lifelong friend. He graduated in 1824, being\r\nthird in his class. After taking his degree he began the study of law\r\nat Portsmouth in the office of Levi Woodbury, where he remained about\r\na year. Afterwards spent two years in the law school at Northampton,\r\nMass., and in the office of Judge Edmund Parker, at Amherst, N.H.\r\nIn 1827 was admitted to the bar and began practice in his native\r\ntown. Espoused the cause of Andrew Jackson with ardor, and in 1829 was\r\nelected to represent his native town in the legislature, where by three\r\nsubsequent elections he served four years, the last two as speaker.\r\nIn 1833 was elected to represent his native district in the lower House\r\nof Congress, where he remained four years; served on the Judiciary and\r\nother important committees. His first important speech in the House was\r\ndelivered in 1834 upon the necessity of economy and of watchfulness\r\nagainst frauds in the payment of Revolutionary claims. In 1834 married\r\nMiss Jane Means Appleton, daughter of Rev. Jesse Appleton, president of\r\nBowdoin College. In 1837 was elected to the United States Senate. On\r\naccount of ill health of his wife, deeming it best for her to return to\r\nNew Hampshire, on June 28, 1842, resigned his seat, and returning to his\r\nhome resumed the practice of the law. In 1838 he changed his residence\r\nfrom Hillsboro to Concord. In 1845 declined an appointment to the United\r\nStates Senate to fill a vacancy. Also declined the nomination for\r\ngovernor, tendered by the Democratic State convention, and in 1845 an\r\nappointment to the office of Attorney-General of the United States,\r\ntendered by President Polk. In 1846, when the war with Mexico began, he\r\nenlisted as a private in a volunteer company organized at Concord; was\r\nsoon afterwards commissioned colonel of the Ninth Regiment of Infantry;\r\nMarch 3, 1847, was commissioned brigadier-general in the Volunteer Army,\r\nand on March 27 embarked for Mexico, arriving at Vera Cruz June 28.\r\nAugust 6, 1847, joined General Scott with his brigade at Puebla, and\r\nsoon set out for the capture of the City of Mexico. Took part in the\r\nbattle of Contreras September 19, 1847, in which engagement he was\r\nseverely injured by being thrown from his horse. The next day, not\r\nhaving recovered, he undertook to accompany his brigade in action\r\nagainst the enemy, when he fainted. He persisted in remaining on duty\r\nin the subsequent operations of the Army. His conduct and services were\r\nspoken of in high terms by his superior officers, Generals Scott, Worth,\r\nand Pillow. Before the battle of Molino del Rey was appointed one of the\r\nAmerican commissioners in the effort for peace, a truce being declared\r\nfor that purpose. The effort failed and the fighting was renewed.\r\nParticipated in the battle of Molino del Rey and continued on duty till\r\npeace was declared. Resigned his commission in March, 1848, and returned\r\nto his home. The same month the legislature of his State voted him\r\na sword of honor in appreciation of his services in the war. Resumed\r\nhis law practice and was highly successful. In 1850 was a member\r\nof the constitutional convention which met at Concord to amend the\r\nconstitution of New Hampshire, and was chosen to preside over its\r\ndeliberations; he favored the removal of the religious-test clause in\r\nthe old constitution, by which Roman Catholics were disqualified from\r\nholding office in the State, and also the abolition of any \"property\r\nqualification;\" he carried these amendments through the convention,\r\nbut the people defeated them at the election. In January, 1852, the\r\nDemocratic State convention of New Hampshire declared for him for\r\nPresident, but in a letter January 12 he positively refused to permit\r\nthe delegation to present his name. The national convention of the party\r\nmet at Baltimore June 1, 1852. On the fourth day he was nominated for\r\nPresident, and was elected in November, receiving 254 electoral votes,\r\nwhile his opponent, General Scott, received only 42. Was inaugurated\r\nMarch 4, 1853. In 1856 he was voted for by his friends in the national\r\nDemocratic convention for renomination, but was unsuccessful. Upon the\r\nexpiration of his term as President he retired to his home at Concord,\r\nwhere he resided the remainder of his life. Died October 8, 1869, and\r\nwas buried at Concord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Countrymen: It is a relief to feel that no heart but my own can know\r\nthe personal regret and bitter sorrow over which I have been borne to a\r\nposition so suitable for others rather than desirable for myself.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I have been called for a limited period to\r\npreside over the destinies of the Republic fill me with a profound sense\r\nof responsibility, but with nothing like shrinking apprehension. I\r\nrepair to the post assigned me not as to one sought, but in obedience to\r\nthe unsolicited expression of your will, answerable only for a fearless,\r\nfaithful, and diligent exercise of my best powers. I ought to be,\r\nand am, truly grateful for the rare manifestation of the nation's\r\nconfidence; but this, so far from lightening my obligations, only adds\r\nto their weight. You have summoned me in my weakness; you must sustain\r\nme by your strength. When looking for the fulfillment of reasonable\r\nrequirements, you will not be unmindful of the great changes which have\r\noccurred, even within the last quarter of a century, and the consequent\r\naugmentation and complexity of duties imposed in the administration both\r\nof your home and foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nWhether the elements of inherent force in the Republic have kept pace\r\nwith its unparalleled progression in territory, population, and wealth\r\nhas been the subject of earnest thought and discussion on both sides of\r\nthe ocean. Less than sixty-four years ago the Father of his Country made\r\n\"the\" then \"recent accession of the important State of North Carolina\r\nto the Constitution of the United States\" one of the subjects of his\r\nspecial congratulation. At that moment, however, when the agitation\r\nconsequent upon the Revolutionary struggle had hardly subsided, when\r\nwe were just emerging from the weakness and embarrassments of the\r\nConfederation, there was an evident consciousness of vigor equal to the\r\ngreat mission so wisely and bravely fulfilled by our fathers. It was not\r\na presumptuous assurance, but a calm faith, springing from a clear view\r\nof the sources of power in a government constituted like ours. It is\r\nno paradox to say that although comparatively weak the new-born nation\r\nwas intrinsically strong. Inconsiderable in population and apparent\r\nresources, it was upheld by a broad and intelligent comprehension of\r\nrights and an all-pervading purpose to maintain them, stronger than\r\narmaments. It came from the furnace of the Revolution, tempered to the\r\nnecessities of the times. The thoughts of the men of that day were as\r\npractical as their sentiments were patriotic. They wasted no portion of\r\ntheir energies upon idle and delusive speculations, but with a firm\r\nand fearless step advanced beyond the governmental landmarks which had\r\nhitherto circumscribed the limits of human freedom and planted their\r\nstandard, where it has stood against dangers which have threatened from\r\nabroad, and internal agitation, which has at times fearfully menaced at\r\nhome. They proved themselves equal to the solution of the great problem,\r\nto understand which their minds had been illuminated by the dawning\r\nlights of the Revolution. The object sought was not a thing dreamed\r\nof; it was a thing realized. They had exhibited not only the power to\r\nachieve, but, what all history affirms to be So much more unusual, the\r\ncapacity to maintain. The oppressed throughout the world from that day\r\nto the present have turned their eyes hitherward, not to find those\r\nlights extinguished or to fear lest they should wane, but to be\r\nconstantly cheered by their steady and increasing radiance.\r\n\r\nIn this our country has, in my judgment, thus far fulfilled its highest\r\nduty to suffering humanity. It has spoken and will continue to speak,\r\nnot only by its words, but by its acts, the language of sympathy,\r\nencouragement, and hope to those who earnestly listen to tones which\r\npronounce for the largest rational liberty. But after all, the most\r\nanimating encouragement and potent appeal for freedom will be its own\r\nhistory--its trials and its triumphs. Preeminently, the power of our\r\nadvocacy reposes in our example; but no example, be it remembered,\r\ncan be powerful for lasting good, whatever apparent advantages may be\r\ngained, which is not based upon eternal principles of right and justice.\r\nOur fathers decided for themselves, both upon the hour to declare and\r\nthe hour to strike. They were their own judges of the circumstances\r\nunder which it became them to pledge to each other \"their lives, their\r\nfortunes, and their sacred honor\" for the acquisition of the priceless\r\ninheritance transmitted to us. The energy with which that great conflict\r\nwas opened and, under the guidance of a manifest and beneficent\r\nProvidence, the uncomplaining endurance with which it was prosecuted to\r\nits consummation were only surpassed by the wisdom and patriotic spirit\r\nof concession which characterized all the counsels of the early fathers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive evidences of that wisdom is to be found in\r\nthe fact that the actual working of our system has dispelled a degree of\r\nsolicitude which at the outset disturbed bold hearts and far-reaching\r\nintellects. The apprehension of dangers from extended territory,\r\nmultiplied States, accumulated wealth, and augmented population has\r\nproved to be unfounded. The stars upon your banner have become nearly\r\nthreefold their original number; your densely populated possessions\r\nskirt the shores of the two great oceans; and yet this vast increase\r\nof people and territory has not only shown itself compatible with\r\nthe harmonious action of the States and Federal Government in their\r\nrespective constitutional spheres, but has afforded an additional\r\nguaranty of the strength and integrity of both.\r\n\r\nWith an experience thus suggestive and cheering, the policy of my\r\nAdministration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil\r\nfrom expansion. Indeed, it is not to be disguised that our attitude as a\r\nnation and our position on the globe render the acquisition of certain\r\npossessions not within our jurisdiction eminently important for our\r\nprotection, if not in the future essential for the preservation of the\r\nrights of commerce and the peace of the world. Should they be obtained,\r\nit will be through no grasping spirit, but with a view to obvious\r\nnational interest and security, and in a manner entirely consistent with\r\nthe strictest observance of national faith. We have nothing in our\r\nhistory or position to invite aggression; we have everything to beckon\r\nus to the cultivation of relations of peace and amity with all nations.\r\nPurposes, therefore, at once just and pacific will be significantly\r\nmarked in the conduct of our foreign affairs. I intend that my\r\nAdministration shall leave no blot upon our fair record, and trust I may\r\nsafely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scope of my\r\nconstitutional control will be tolerated on the part of any portion of\r\nour citizens which can not challenge a ready justification before the\r\ntribunal of the civilized world. An Administration would be unworthy of\r\nconfidence at home or respect abroad should it cease to be influenced by\r\nthe conviction that no apparent advantage can be purchased at a price so\r\ndear as that of national wrong or dishonor. It is not your privilege as\r\na nation to speak of a distant past. The striking incidents of your\r\nhistory, replete with instruction and furnishing abundant grounds for\r\nhopeful confidence, are comprised in a period comparatively brief.\r\nBut if your past is limited, your future is boundless. Its obligations\r\nthrong the unexplored pathway of advancement, and will be limitless as\r\nduration. Hence a sound and comprehensive policy should embrace not less\r\nthe distant future than the urgent present.\r\n\r\nThe great objects of our pursuit as a people are best to be attained by\r\npeace, and are entirely consistent with the tranquillity and interests\r\nof the rest of mankind. With the neighboring nations upon our continent\r\nwe should cultivate kindly and fraternal relations. We can desire\r\nnothing in regard to them so much as to see them consolidate their\r\nstrength and pursue the paths of prosperity and happiness. If in the\r\ncourse of their growth we should open new channels of trade and create\r\nadditional facilities for friendly intercourse, the benefits realized\r\nwill be equal and mutual, Of the complicated European systems of\r\nnational polity we have heretofore been independent. From their wars,\r\ntheir tumults, and anxieties we have been, happily, almost entirely\r\nexempt. Whilst these are confined to the nations which gave them\r\nexistence, and within their legitimate jurisdiction, they can not affect\r\nus except as they appeal to our Sympathies in the cause of human freedom\r\nand universal advancement. But the vast interests of commerce are\r\ncommon to all mankind, and the advantages of trade and international\r\nintercourse must always present a noble field for the moral influence\r\nof a great people.\r\n\r\nWith these views firmly and honestly carried out, we have a right to\r\nexpect, and shall under all circumstances require, prompt reciprocity.\r\nThe rights which belong to us as a nation are not alone to be regarded,\r\nbut those which pertain to every citizen in his individual capacity, at\r\nhome and abroad, must be sacredly maintained. So long as he can discern\r\nevery star in its place upon that ensign, without wealth to purchase\r\nfor him preferment or title to secure for him place, it will be his\r\nprivilege, and must be his acknowledged right, to stand unabashed even\r\nin the presence of princes, with a proud consciousness that he is\r\nhimself one of a nation of sovereigns and that he can not in legitimate\r\npursuit wander so far from home that the agent whom he shall leave\r\nbehind in the place which I now occupy will not see that no rude hand\r\nof power or tyrannical passion is laid upon him with impunity. He must\r\nrealize that upon every sea and on every soil where our enterprise may\r\nrightfully seek the protection of our flag American citizenship is an\r\ninviolable panoply for the security of American rights. And in this\r\nconnection it can hardly be necessary to reaffirm a principle which\r\nshould now be regarded as fundamental. The rights, security, and repose\r\nof this Confederacy reject the idea of interference or colonization on\r\nthis side of the ocean by any foreign power beyond present jurisdiction\r\nas utterly inadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities of observation furnished by my brief experience as a\r\nsoldier confirmed in my own mind the opinion, entertained and acted upon\r\nby others from the formation of the Government, that the maintenance of\r\nlarge standing armies in our country would be not only dangerous, but\r\nunnecessary. They also illustrated the importance--I might well say\r\nthe absolute necessity--of the military science and practical skill\r\nfurnished in such an eminent degree by the institution which has made\r\nyour Army what it is, under the discipline and instruction of officers\r\nnot more distinguished for their solid attainments, gallantry, and\r\ndevotion to the public service than for unobtrusive bearing and high\r\nmoral tone. The Army as organized must be the nucleus around which in\r\nevery time of need the strength of your military power, the sure bulwark\r\nof your defense--a national militia--may be readily formed into a\r\nwell-disciplined and efficient organization. And the skill and\r\nself-devotion of the Navy assure you that you may take the performance\r\nof the past as a pledge for the future, and may confidently expect that\r\nthe flag which has waved its untarnished folds over every sea will still\r\nfloat in undiminished honor. But these, like many other subjects, will\r\nbe appropriately brought at a future time to the attention of the\r\ncoordinate branches of the Government, to which I shall always look\r\nwith profound respect and with trustful confidence that they will accord\r\nto me the aid and support which I shall so much need and which their\r\nexperience and wisdom will readily suggest.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of domestic affairs you expect a devoted\r\nintegrity in the public service and an observance of rigid economy\r\nin all departments, so marked as never justly to be questioned. If this\r\nreasonable expectation be not realized, I frankly confess that one of\r\nyour leading hopes is doomed to disappointment, and that my efforts\r\nin a very important particular must result in a humiliating failure.\r\nOffices can be properly regarded only in the light of aids for the\r\naccomplishment of these objects, and as occupancy can confer no\r\nprerogative nor importunate desire for preferment any claim, the public\r\ninterest imperatively demands that they be considered with sole\r\nreference to the duties to be performed. Good citizens may well claim\r\nthe protection of good laws and the benign influence of good government,\r\nbut a claim for office is what the people of a republic should never\r\nrecognize. No reasonable man of any party will expect the Administration\r\nto be so regardless of its responsibility and of the obvious elements\r\nof success as to retain persons known to be under the influence of\r\npolitical hostility and partisan prejudice in positions which will\r\nrequire not only severe labor, but cordial cooperation. Having no\r\nimplied engagements to ratify, no rewards to bestow, no resentments to\r\nremember, and no personal wishes to consult in selections for official\r\nstation, I shall fulfill this difficult and delicate trust, admitting\r\nno motive as worthy either of my character or position which does not\r\ncontemplate an efficient discharge of duty and the best interests of my\r\ncountry. I acknowledge my obligations to the masses of my countrymen,\r\nand to them alone. Higher objects than personal aggrandizement gave\r\ndirection and energy to their exertions in the late canvass, and\r\nthey shall not be disappointed. They require at my hands diligence,\r\nintegrity, and capacity wherever there are duties to be performed.\r\nWithout these qualities in their public servants, more stringent laws\r\nfor the prevention or punishment of fraud, negligence, and peculation\r\nwill be vain. With them they will be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut these are not the only points to which you look for vigilant\r\nwatchfulness. The dangers of a concentration of all power in the\r\ngeneral government of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious\r\nto be disregarded. You have a right, therefore, to expect your agents\r\nin every department to regard strictly the limits imposed upon them\r\nby the Constitution of the United States. The great scheme of our\r\nconstitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power\r\nbetween the State and Federal authorities, and experience has shown\r\nthat the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just\r\ndiscrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of\r\nthe States and your common rights and obligations under the General\r\nGovernment; and here, in my opinion, are the considerations which should\r\nform the true basis of future concord in regard to the questions which\r\nhave most seriously disturbed public tranquillity. If the Federal\r\nGovernment will confine itself to the exercise of powers clearly granted\r\nby the Constitution, it can hardly happen that its action upon any\r\nquestion should endanger the institutions of the States or interfere\r\nwith their right to manage matters strictly domestic according to the\r\nwill of their own people.\r\n\r\nIn expressing briefly my views upon an important subject which has\r\nrecently agitated the nation to almost a fearful degree, I am moved by\r\nno other impulse than a most earnest desire for the perpetuation of that\r\nUnion which has made us what we are, showering upon us blessings and\r\nconferring a power and influence which our fathers could hardly have\r\nanticipated, even with their most sanguine hopes directed to a far-off\r\nfuture. The sentiments I now announce were not unknown before the\r\nexpression of the voice which called me here. My own position upon this\r\nsubject was clear and unequivocal, upon the record of my words and my\r\nacts, and it is only recurred to at this time because silence might\r\nperhaps be misconstrued. With the Union my best and dearest earthly\r\nhopes are entwined. Without it what are we individually or collectively?\r\nWhat becomes of the noblest field ever opened for the advancement of our\r\nrace in religion, in government, in the arts, and in all that dignifies\r\nand adorns mankind? From that radiant constellation which both illumines\r\nour own way and points out to struggling nations their course, let but a\r\nsingle star be lost, and, if there be not utter darkness, the luster of\r\nthe whole is dimmed. Do my countrymen need any assurance that such a\r\ncatastrophe is not to overtake them while I possess the power to stay\r\nit? It is with me an earnest and vital belief that as the Union has been\r\nthe source, under Providence, of our prosperity to this time, so it is\r\nthe surest pledge of a continuance of the blessings we have enjoyed, and\r\nwhich we are sacredly bound to transmit undiminished to our children.\r\nThe field of calm and free discussion in our country is open, and will\r\nalways be so, but never has been and never can be traversed for good\r\nin a spirit of sectionalism and uncharitableness. The founders of the\r\nRepublic dealt with things as they were presented to them, in a spirit\r\nof self-sacrificing patriotism, and, as time has proved, with a\r\ncomprehensive wisdom which it will always be safe for us to consult.\r\nEvery measure tending to strengthen the fraternal feelings of all the\r\nmembers of our Union has had my heartfelt approbation. To every theory\r\nof society or government, whether the offspring of feverish ambition\r\nor of morbid enthusiasm, calculated to dissolve the bonds of law\r\nand affection which unite us, I shall interpose a ready and stern\r\nresistance. I believe that involuntary servitude, as it exists in\r\ndifferent States of this Confederacy, is recognized by the Constitution.\r\nI believe that it stands like any other admitted right, and that the\r\nStates where it exists are entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the\r\nconstitutional provisions. I hold that the laws of 1850, commonly called\r\nthe \"compromise measures,\" are strictly constitutional and to be\r\nunhesitatingly carried into effect. I believe that the constituted\r\nauthorities of this Republic are bound to regard the rights of the South\r\nin this respect as they would view any other legal and constitutional\r\nright, and that the laws to enforce them should be respected and obeyed,\r\nnot with a reluctance encouraged by abstract opinions as to their\r\npropriety in a different state of society, but cheerfully and according\r\nto the decisions of the tribunal to which their exposition belongs.\r\nSuch have been, and are, my convictions, and upon them I shall act.\r\nI fervently hope that the question is at rest, and that no sectional or\r\nambitious or fanatical excitement may again threaten the durability of\r\nour institutions or obscure the light of our prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut let not the foundation of our hope rest upon man's wisdom. It will\r\nnot be sufficient that sectional prejudices find no place in the public\r\ndeliberations. It will not be sufficient that the rash counsels of human\r\npassion are rejected. It must be felt that there is no national security\r\nbut in the nation's humble, acknowledged dependence upon God and His\r\noverruling providence.\r\n\r\nWe have been carried in safety through a perilous crisis. Wise counsels,\r\nlike those which gave us the Constitution, prevailed to uphold it. Let\r\nthe period be remembered as an admonition, and not as an encouragement,\r\nin any section of the Union, to make experiments where experiments are\r\nfraught with such fearful hazard. Let it be impressed upon all hearts\r\nthat, beautiful as our fabric is, no earthly power or wisdom could ever\r\nreunite its broken fragments. Standing, as I do, almost within view\r\nof the green slopes of Monticello, and, as it were, within reach of\r\nthe tomb of Washington, with all the cherished memories of the past\r\ngathering around me like so many eloquent voices of exhortation from\r\nheaven, I can express no better hope for my country than that the kind\r\nProvidence which smiled upon our fathers may enable their children to\r\npreserve the blessings they have inherited.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 21, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 17th instant,\r\nrespecting certain propositions to Nicaragua and Costa Rica relative to\r\nthe settlement of the territorial controversies between the States and\r\nGovernments bordering on the river San Juan, I transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 21, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eleventh article of the treaty with the Chickasaw Indians of the\r\n20th October, 1832, provides that certain moneys arising from the sales\r\nof the lands ceded by that treaty shall be laid out under the direction\r\nof the President of the United States, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, in such safe and valuable stock as he may approve\r\nof, for the benefit of the Chickasaw Nation.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury of the 15th instant,\r\nherewith transmitted, shows that the sum of $58,100 5 per cent stock,\r\ncreated under the act of 3d March, 1843, now stands on the books of the\r\nTreasury in the name of the Secretary of the Treasury, as trustee for\r\nthe Chickasaw national fund. This stock, by the terms of its issue, is\r\nredeemable on the 1st July next, when interest thereon will cease.

DOBBIN,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of the Navy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _December 5, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe interest with which the people of the Republic anticipate the\r\nassembling of Congress and the fulfillment on that occasion of the duty\r\nimposed upon a new President is one of the best evidences of their\r\ncapacity to realize the hopes of the founders of a political system\r\nat once complex and symmetrical. While the different branches of the\r\nGovernment are to a certain extent independent of each other, the duties\r\nof all alike have direct reference to the source of power. Fortunately,\r\nunder this system no man is so high and none so humble in the scale of\r\npublic station as to escape from the scrutiny or to be exempt from the\r\nresponsibility which all official functions imply.\r\n\r\nUpon the justice and intelligence of the masses, in a government thus\r\norganized, is the sole reliance of the confederacy and the only security\r\nfor honest and earnest devotion to its interests against the usurpations\r\nand encroachments of power on the one hand and the assaults of personal\r\nambition on the other.\r\n\r\nThe interest of which I have spoken is inseparable from an inquiring,\r\nself-governing community, but stimulated, doubtless, at the present time\r\nby the unsettled condition of our relations with several foreign powers,\r\nby the new obligations resulting from a sudden extension of the field of\r\nenterprise, by the spirit with which that field has been entered and the\r\namazing energy with which its resources for meeting the demands of\r\nhumanity have been developed.\r\n\r\nAlthough disease, assuming at one time the characteristics of a\r\nwidespread and devastating pestilence, has left its sad traces upon\r\nsome portions of our country, we have still the most abundant cause\r\nfor reverent thankfulness to God for an accumulation of signal mercies\r\nshowered upon us as a nation. It is well that a consciousness of rapid\r\nadvancement and increasing strength be habitually associated with an\r\nabiding sense of dependence upon Him who holds in His hands the destiny\r\nof men and of nations.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the wisdom of the broad principle of absolute religious\r\ntoleration proclaimed in our fundamental law, and rejoicing in the\r\nbenign influence which it has exerted upon our social and political\r\ncondition, I should shrink from a clear duty did I fail to express\r\nmy deepest conviction that we can place no secure reliance upon any\r\napparent progress if it be not sustained by national integrity, resting\r\nupon the great truths affirmed and illustrated by divine revelation.\r\nIn the midst of our sorrow for the afflicted and suffering, it has been\r\nconsoling to see how promptly disaster made true neighbors of districts\r\nand cities separated widely from each other, and cheering to watch the\r\nstrength of that common bond of brotherhood which unites all hearts, in\r\nall parts of this Union, when danger threatens from abroad or calamity\r\nimpends over us at home.\r\n\r\nOur diplomatic relations with foreign powers have undergone no essential\r\nchange since the adjournment of the last Congress. With some of them\r\nquestions of a disturbing character are still pending, but there are\r\ngood reasons to believe that these may all be amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nFor some years past Great Britain has so construed the first article of\r\nthe convention of the 20th of April, 1818, in regard to the fisheries\r\non the northeastern coast, as to exclude our citizens from some of the\r\nfishing grounds to which they freely resorted for nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury subsequent to the date of that treaty. The United States have\r\nnever acquiesced in this construction, but have always claimed for\r\ntheir fishermen all the rights which they had so long enjoyed without\r\nmolestation. With a view to remove all difficulties on the subject,\r\nto extend the rights of our fishermen beyond the limits fixed by the\r\nconvention of 1818, and to regulate trade between the United States and\r\nthe British North American Provinces, a negotiation has been opened with\r\na fair prospect of a favorable result. To protect our fishermen in the\r\nenjoyment of their rights and prevent collision between them and British\r\nfishermen, I deemed it expedient to station a naval force in that\r\nquarter during the fishing season.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassing questions have also arisen between the two Governments in\r\nregard to Central America. Great Britain has proposed to settle them by\r\nan amicable arrangement, and our minister at London is instructed to\r\nenter into negotiations on that subject.\r\n\r\nA commission for adjusting the claims of our citizens against Great\r\nBritain and those of British subjects against the United States,\r\norganized under the convention of the 8th of February last, is now\r\nsitting in London for the transaction of business.\r\n\r\nIt is in many respects desirable that the boundary line between the\r\nUnited States and the British Provinces in the northwest, as designated\r\nin the convention of the 15th of June, 1846, and especially that part\r\nwhich separates the Territory of Washington from the British possessions\r\non the north, should be traced and marked. I therefore present the\r\nsubject to your notice.\r\n\r\nWith France our relations continue on the most friendly footing. The\r\nextensive commerce between the United States and that country might,\r\nit is conceived, be released from some unnecessary restrictions to\r\nthe mutual advantage of both parties. With a view to this object,\r\nsome progress has been made in negotiating a treaty of commerce and\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nIndependently of our valuable trade with Spain, we have important\r\npolitical relations with her growing out of our neighborhood to the\r\nislands of Cuba and Porto Rico. I am happy to announce that since the\r\nlast Congress no attempts have been made by unauthorized expeditions\r\nwithin the United States against either of those colonies. Should any\r\nmovement be manifested within our limits, all the means at my command\r\nwill be vigorously exerted to repress it. Several annoying occurrences\r\nhave taken place at Havana, or in the vicinity of the island of Cuba,\r\nbetween our citizens and the Spanish authorities. Considering the\r\nproximity of that island to our shores, lying, as it does, in the track\r\nof trade between some of our principal cities, and the suspicious\r\nvigilance with which foreign intercourse, particularly that with the\r\nUnited States, is there guarded, a repetition of such occurrences may\r\nwell be apprehended.\r\n\r\nAs no diplomatic intercourse is allowed between our consul at Havana\r\nand the Captain-General of Cuba, ready explanations can not be made or\r\nprompt redress afforded where injury has resulted. All complaint on the\r\npart of our citizens under the present arrangement must be, in the first\r\nplace, presented to this Government and then referred to Spain. Spain\r\nagain refers it to her local authorities in Cuba for investigation, and\r\npostpones an answer till she has heard from those authorities. To avoid\r\nthese irritating and vexatious delays, a proposition has been made to\r\nprovide for a direct appeal for redress to the Captain-General by our\r\nconsul in behalf of our injured fellow-citizens. Hitherto the Government\r\nof Spain has declined to enter into any such arrangement. This course\r\non her part is deeply regretted, for without some arrangement of this\r\nkind the good understanding between the two countries may be exposed to\r\noccasional interruption. Our minister at Madrid is instructed to renew\r\nthe proposition and to press it again upon the consideration of Her\r\nCatholic Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nFor several years Spain has been calling the attention of this\r\nGovernment to a claim for losses by some of her subjects in the case\r\nof the schooner _Amistad_. This claim is believed to rest on the\r\nobligations imposed by our existing treaty with that country. Its\r\njustice was admitted in our diplomatic correspondence with the Spanish\r\nGovernment as early as March, 1847, and one of my predecessors, in his\r\nannual message of that year, recommended that provision should be made\r\nfor its payment. In January last it was again submitted to Congress by\r\nthe Executive. It has received a favorable consideration by committees\r\nof both branches, but as yet there has been no final action upon it. I\r\nconceive that good faith requires its prompt adjustment, and I present\r\nit to your early and favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nMartin Koszta, a Hungarian by birth, came to this country in 1850, and\r\ndeclared his intention in due form of law to become a citizen of the\r\nUnited States. After remaining here nearly two years he visited Turkey.\r\nWhile at Smyrna he was forcibly seized, taken on board an Austrian brig\r\nof war then lying in the harbor of that place, and there confined in\r\nirons, with the avowed design to take him into the dominions of Austria.\r\nOur consul at Smyrna and legation at Constantinople interposed for\r\nhis release, but their efforts were ineffectual. While thus in prison\r\nCommander Ingraham, with the United States ship of war _St. Louis_,\r\narrived at Smyrna, and after inquiring into the circumstances of the\r\ncase came to the conclusion that Koszta was entitled to the protection\r\nof this Government, and took energetic and prompt measures for his\r\nrelease. Under an arrangement between the agents of the United States\r\nand of Austria, he was transferred to the custody of the French\r\nconsul-general at Smyrna, there to remain until he should be disposed of\r\nby the mutual agreement of the consuls of the respective Governments at\r\nthat place. Pursuant to that agreement, he has been released, and is now\r\nin the United States. The Emperor of Austria has made the conduct of our\r\nofficers who took part in this transaction a subject of grave complaint.\r\nRegarding Koszta as still his subject, and claiming a right to seize\r\nhim within the limits of the Turkish Empire, he has demanded of this\r\nGovernment its consent to the surrender of the prisoner, a disavowal of\r\nthe acts of its agents, and satisfaction for the alleged outrage. After\r\na careful consideration of the case I came to the conclusion that Koszta\r\nwas seized without legal authority at Smyrna; that he was wrongfully\r\ndetained on board of the Austrian brig of war; that at the time of his\r\nseizure he was clothed with the nationality of the United States, and\r\nthat the acts of our officers, under the circumstances of the case,\r\nwere justifiable, and their conduct has been fully approved by me,\r\nand a compliance with the several demands of the Emperor of Austria has\r\nbeen declined.\r\n\r\nFor a more full account of this transaction and my views in regard\r\nto it I refer to the correspondence between the chargé d'affaires of\r\nAustria and the Secretary of State, which is herewith transmitted. The\r\nprinciples and policy therein maintained on the part of the United\r\nStates will, whenever a proper occasion occurs, be applied and enforced.\r\n\r\nThe condition of China at this time renders it probable that some\r\nimportant changes will occur in that vast Empire which will lead to a\r\nmore unrestricted intercourse with it. The commissioner to that country\r\nwho has been recently appointed is instructed to avail himself of all\r\noccasions to open and extend our commercial relations, not only with the\r\nEmpire of China, but with other Asiatic nations.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 an expedition was sent to Japan, under the command of Commodore\r\nPerry, for the purpose of opening commercial intercourse with that\r\nEmpire. Intelligence has been received of his arrival there and of his\r\nhaving made known to the Emperor of Japan the object of his visit. But\r\nit is not yet ascertained how far the Emperor will be disposed to\r\nabandon his restrictive policy and open that populous country to a\r\ncommercial intercourse with the United States.\r\n\r\nIt has been my earnest desire to maintain friendly intercourse with the\r\nGovernments upon this continent and to aid them in preserving good\r\nunderstanding among themselves. With Mexico a dispute has arisen as\r\nto the true boundary line between our Territory of New Mexico and the\r\nMexican State of Chihuahua. A former commissioner of the United States,\r\nemployed in running that line pursuant to the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, made a serious mistake in determining the initial point on\r\nthe Rio Grande; but inasmuch as his decision was clearly a departure\r\nfrom the directions for tracing the boundary contained in that treaty,\r\nand was not concurred in by the surveyor appointed on the part of the\r\nUnited States, whose concurrence was necessary to give validity to that\r\ndecision, this Government is not concluded thereby; but that of Mexico\r\ntakes a different view of the subject.\r\n\r\nThere are also other questions of considerable magnitude pending between\r\nthe two Republics. Our minister in Mexico has ample instructions to\r\nadjust them. Negotiations have been opened, but sufficient progress has\r\nnot been made therein to enable me to speak of the probable result.\r\nImpressed with the importance of maintaining amicable relations with\r\nthat Republic and of yielding with liberality to all her just claims,\r\nit is reasonable to expect that an arrangement mutually satisfactory to\r\nboth countries may be concluded and a lasting friendship between them\r\nconfirmed and perpetuated.\r\n\r\nCongress having provided for a full mission to the States of Central\r\nAmerica, a minister was sent thither in July last. As yet he has had\r\ntime to visit only one of these States (Nicaragua), where he was\r\nreceived in the most friendly manner. It is hoped that his presence and\r\ngood offices will have a benign effect in composing the dissensions\r\nwhich prevail among them, and in establishing still more intimate and\r\nfriendly relations between them respectively and between each of them\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\nConsidering the vast regions of this continent and the number of states\r\nwhich would be made accessible by the free navigation of the river\r\nAmazon, particular attention has been given to this subject. Brazil,\r\nthrough whose territories it passes into the ocean, has hitherto\r\npersisted in a policy so restricted in regard to the use of this river\r\nas to obstruct and nearly exclude foreign commercial intercourse with\r\nthe States which lie upon its tributaries and upper branches. Our\r\nminister to that country is instructed to obtain a relaxation of that\r\npolicy and to use his efforts to induce the Brazilian Government to open\r\nto common use, under proper safeguards, this great natural highway for\r\ninternational trade. Several of the South American States are deeply\r\ninterested in this attempt to secure the free navigation of the Amazon,\r\nand it is reasonable to expect their cooperation in the measure. As the\r\nadvantages of free commercial intercourse among nations are better\r\nunderstood, more liberal views are generally entertained as to the\r\ncommon rights of all to the free use of those means which nature has\r\nprovided for international communication. To these more liberal and\r\nenlightened views it is hoped that Brazil will conform her policy and\r\nremove all unnecessary restrictions upon the free use of a river which\r\ntraverses so many states and so large a part of the continent. I am\r\nhappy to inform you that the Republic of Paraguay and the Argentine\r\nConfederation have yielded to the liberal policy still resisted by\r\nBrazil in regard to the navigable rivers within their respective\r\nterritories. Treaties embracing this subject, among others, have been\r\nnegotiated with these Governments, which will be submitted to the Senate\r\nat the present session.\r\n\r\nA new branch of commerce, important to the agricultural interests of\r\nthe United States, has within a few years past been opened with Peru.\r\nNotwithstanding the inexhaustible deposits of guano upon the islands of\r\nthat country, considerable difficulties are experienced in obtaining the\r\nrequisite supply. Measures have been taken to remove these difficulties\r\nand to secure a more abundant importation of the article. Unfortunately,\r\nthere has been a serious collision between our citizens who have\r\nresorted to the Chincha Islands for it and the Peruvian authorities\r\nstationed there. Redress for the outrages committed by the latter was\r\npromptly demanded by our minister at Lima. This subject is now under\r\nconsideration, and there is reason to believe that Peru is disposed to\r\noffer adequate indemnity to the aggrieved parties.\r\n\r\nWe are thus not only at peace with all foreign countries, but, in regard\r\nto political affairs, are exempt from any cause of serious disquietude\r\nin our domestic relations.\r\n\r\nThe controversies which have agitated the country heretofore are passing\r\naway with the causes which produced them and the passions which they had\r\nawakened; or, if any trace of them remains, it may be reasonably hoped\r\nthat it will only be perceived in the zealous rivalry of all good\r\ncitizens to testify their respect for the rights of the States, their\r\ndevotion to the Union, and their common determination that each one of\r\nthe States, its institutions, its welfare, and its domestic peace, shall\r\nbe held alike secure under the sacred aegis of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis new league of amity and of mutual confidence and support into which\r\nthe people of the Republic have entered happily affords inducement and\r\nopportunity for the adoption of a more comprehensive and unembarrassed\r\nline of policy and action as to the great material interests of the\r\ncountry, whether regarded in themselves or in connection with the powers\r\nof the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe United States have continued gradually and steadily to expand\r\nthrough acquisitions of territory, which, how much soever some of them\r\nmay have been questioned, are now universally seen and admitted to have\r\nbeen wise in policy, just in character, and a great element in the\r\nadvancement of our country, and with it of the human race, in freedom,\r\nin prosperity, and in happiness. The thirteen States have grown to be\r\nthirty-one, with relations reaching to Europe on the one side and on the\r\nother to the distant realms of Asia.\r\n\r\nI am deeply sensible of the immense responsibility which the present\r\nmagnitude of the Republic and the diversity and multiplicity of its\r\ninterests devolves upon me, the alleviation of which, so far as relates\r\nto the immediate conduct of the public business, is, first, in my\r\nreliance on the wisdom and patriotism of the two Houses of Congress,\r\nand, secondly, in the directions afforded me by the principles of public\r\npolity affirmed by our fathers of the epoch of 1798, sanctioned by long\r\nexperience, and consecrated anew by the overwhelming voice of the people\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nRecurring to these principles, which constitute the organic basis of\r\nunion, we perceive that vast as are the functions and the duties of\r\nthe Federal Government, vested in or intrusted to its three great\r\ndepartments--the legislative, executive, and judicial--yet the\r\nsubstantive power, the popular force, and the large capacities for\r\nsocial and material development exist in the respective States, which,\r\nall being of themselves well-constituted republics, as they preceded\r\nso they alone are capable of maintaining and perpetuating the American\r\nUnion. The Federal Government has its appropriate line of action in the\r\nspecific and limited powers conferred on it by the Constitution, chiefly\r\nas to those things in which the States have a common interest in their\r\nrelations to one another and to foreign governments, while the great\r\nmass of interests which belong to cultivated men--the ordinary business\r\nof life, the springs of industry, all the diversified personal and\r\ndomestic affairs of society--rest securely upon the general reserved\r\npowers of the people of the several States. There is the effective\r\ndemocracy of the nation, and there the vital essence of its being and\r\nits greatness.\r\n\r\nOf the practical consequences which flow from the nature of the Federal\r\nGovernment, the primary one is the duty of administering with integrity\r\nand fidelity the high trust reposed in it by the Constitution,\r\nespecially in the application of the public funds as drawn by taxation\r\nfrom the people and appropriated to specific objects by Congress.\r\n\r\nHappily, I have no occasion to suggest any radical changes in the\r\nfinancial policy of the Government. Ours is almost, if not absolutely,\r\nthe solitary power of Christendom having a surplus revenue drawn\r\nimmediately from imposts on commerce, and therefore measured by the\r\nspontaneous enterprise and national prosperity of the country, with\r\nsuch indirect relation to agriculture, manufactures, and the products\r\nof the earth and sea as to violate no constitutional doctrine and yet\r\nvigorously promote the general welfare. Neither as to the sources of the\r\npublic treasure nor as to the manner of keeping and managing it does any\r\ngrave controversy now prevail, there being a general acquiescence in the\r\nwisdom of the present system.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit in detail the\r\nstate of the public finances and the condition of the various branches\r\nof the public service administered by that Department of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the country, levied almost insensibly to the taxpayer,\r\ngoes on from year to year, increasing beyond either the interests or the\r\nprospective wants of the Government.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1852, there remained in\r\nthe Treasury a balance of $14,632,136. The public revenue for the fiscal\r\nyear ending June 30, 1853, amounted to $58,931,865 from customs and to\r\n$2,405,708 from public lands and other miscellaneous sources, amounting\r\ntogether to $61,337,574, while the public expenditures for the same\r\nperiod, exclusive of payments on account of the public debt, amounted\r\nto $43,554,262, leaving a balance of $32,425,447 of receipts above\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nThis fact of increasing surplus in the Treasury became the subject of\r\nanxious consideration at a very early period of my Administration, and\r\nthe path of duty in regard to it seemed to me obvious and clear, namely:\r\nFirst, to apply the surplus revenue to the discharge of the public debt\r\nso far as it could judiciously be done, and, secondly, to devise means\r\nfor the gradual reduction of the revenue to the standard of the public\r\nexigencies.\r\n\r\nOf these objects the first has been in the course of accomplishment in\r\na manner and to a degree highly satisfactory. The amount of the public\r\ndebt of all classes was on the 4th of March, 1853, $69,190,037, payments\r\non account of which have been made since that period to the amount of\r\n$12,703,329, leaving unpaid and in continuous course of liquidation the\r\nsum of $56,486,708. These payments, although made at the market price of\r\nthe respective classes of stocks, have been effected readily and to the\r\ngeneral advantage of the Treasury, and have at the same time proved of\r\nsignal utility in the relief they have incidentally afforded to the\r\nmoney market and to the industrial and commercial pursuits of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe second of the above-mentioned objects, that of the reduction of the\r\ntariff, is of great importance, and the plan suggested by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, which is to reduce the duties on certain articles and\r\nto add to the free list many articles now taxed, and especially such as\r\nenter into manufactures and are not largely, or at all, produced in the\r\ncountry, is commended to your candid and careful consideration.\r\n\r\nYou will find in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, also,\r\nabundant proof of the entire adequacy of the present fiscal system\r\nto meet all the requirements of the public service, and that, while\r\nproperly administered, it operates to the advantage of the community\r\nin ordinary business relations.\r\n\r\nI respectfully ask your attention to sundry suggestions of improvements\r\nin the settlement of accounts, especially as regards the large sums of\r\noutstanding arrears due to the Government, and of other reforms in the\r\nadministrative action of his Department which are indicated by the\r\nSecretary; as also to the progress made in the construction of marine\r\nhospitals, custom-houses, and of a new mint in California and assay\r\noffice in the city of New York, heretofore provided for by Congress, and\r\nalso to the eminently successful progress of the Coast Survey and of the\r\nLight-House Board.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects meriting your attention will be important\r\nrecommendations from the Secretaries of War and Navy. I am fully\r\nsatisfied that the Navy of the United States is not in a condition\r\nof strength and efficiency commensurate with the magnitude of our\r\ncommercial and other interests, and commend to your especial attention\r\nthe suggestions on this subject made by the Secretary of the Navy.\r\nI respectfully submit that the Army, which under our system must always\r\nbe regarded with the highest interest as a nucleus around which the\r\nvolunteer forces of the nation gather in the hour of danger, requires\r\naugmentation, or modification, to adapt it to the present extended\r\nlimits and frontier relations of the country and the condition of the\r\nIndian tribes in the interior of the continent, the necessity of which\r\nwill appear in the communications of the Secretaries of War and the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the Post-Office Department for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1853, the gross expenditure was $7,982,756, and the\r\ngross receipts during the same period $5,942,734, showing that the\r\ncurrent revenue failed to meet the current expenses of the Department\r\nby the sum of $2,042,032. The causes which, under the present postal\r\nsystem and laws, led inevitably to this result are fully explained by\r\nthe report of the Postmaster-General, one great cause being the enormous\r\nrates the Department has been compelled to pay for mail service rendered\r\nby railroad companies.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit in the report of the Postmaster-General of the income and\r\nexpenditures by mail steamers will be found peculiarly interesting and\r\nof a character to demand the immediate action of Congress.\r\n\r\nNumerous and flagrant frauds upon the Pension Bureau have been brought\r\nto light within the last year, and in some instances merited punishments\r\ninflicted; but, unfortunately, in others guilty parties have escaped,\r\nnot through the want of sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, but\r\nin consequence of the provisions of limitation in the existing laws.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of these claims, the remoteness of the tribunals to pass\r\nupon them, and the mode in which the proof is of necessity furnished,\r\ntemptations to crime have been greatly stimulated by the obvious\r\ndifficulties of detection. The defects in the law upon this subject are\r\nso apparent and so fatal to the ends of justice that your early action\r\nrelating to it is most desirable.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 9,819,411 acres of the public lands have\r\nbeen surveyed and 10,363,891 acres brought into market. Within the\r\nsame period the sales by public purchase and private entry amounted to\r\n1,083,495 acres; located under military bounty-land warrants, 6,142,360\r\nacres; located under other certificates, 9,427 acres; ceded to the\r\nStates as swamp lands, 16,684,253 acres; selected for railroad and other\r\nobjects under acts of Congress, 1,427,457 acres; total amount of lands\r\ndisposed of within the fiscal year, 25,346,992 acres, which is an\r\nincrease in quantity sold and located under land warrants and grants\r\nof 12,231,818 acres over the fiscal year immediately preceding. The\r\nquantity of land sold during the second and third quarters of 1852 was\r\n334,451 acres; the amount received therefor was $623,687. The quantity\r\nsold the second and third quarters of the year 1853 was 1,609,919 acres,\r\nand the amount received therefor $2,226,876.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of land warrants issued under existing laws prior to\r\nthe 30th of September last was 266,042, of which there were outstanding\r\nat that date 66,947. The quantity of land required to satisfy these\r\noutstanding warrants is 4,778,120 acres.\r\n\r\nWarrants have been issued to 30th of September last under the act\r\nof 11th February, 1847, calling for 12,879,280 acres, under acts of\r\nSeptember 28, 1850, and March 22, 1852, calling for 12,505,360 acres,\r\nmaking a total of 25,384,640 acres.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that experience has verified the wisdom and justice of\r\nthe present system with regard to the public domain in most essential\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Interior that\r\nopinions which have often been expressed in relation to the operation of\r\nthe land system as not being a source of revenue to the Federal Treasury\r\nwere erroneous. The net profits from the sale of the public lands to\r\nJune 30, 1853, amounted to the sum of $53,289,465.\r\n\r\nI recommend the extension of the land system over the Territories of\r\nUtah and New Mexico, with such modifications as their peculiarities may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nRegarding our public domain as chiefly valuable to provide homes for\r\nthe industrious and enterprising, I am not prepared to recommend any\r\nessential change in the land system, except by modifications in favor\r\nof the actual settler and an extension of the preemption principle in\r\ncertain cases, for reasons and on grounds which will be fully developed\r\nin the reports to be laid before you.\r\n\r\nCongress, representing the proprietors of the territorial domain and\r\ncharged especially with power to dispose of territory belonging to\r\nthe United States, has for a long course of years, beginning with the\r\nAdministration of Mr. Jefferson, exercised the power to construct roads\r\nwithin the Territories, and there are so many and obvious distinctions\r\nbetween this exercise of power and that of making roads within the\r\nStates that the former has never been considered subject to such\r\nobjections as apply to the latter; and such may now be considered the\r\nsettled construction of the power of the Federal Government upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nNumerous applications have been and no doubt will continue to be made\r\nfor grants of land in aid of the construction of railways. It is not\r\nbelieved to be within the intent and meaning of the Constitution that\r\nthe power to dispose of the public domain should be used otherwise than\r\nmight be expected from a prudent proprietor, and therefore that grants\r\nof land to aid in the construction of roads should be restricted to\r\ncases where it would be for the interest of a proprietor under like\r\ncircumstances thus to contribute to the construction of these works.\r\nFor the practical operation of such grants thus far in advancing the\r\ninterests of the States in which the works are located, and at the same\r\ntime the substantial interests of all the other States, by enhancing the\r\nvalue and promoting the rapid sale of the public domain, I refer you\r\nto the report of the Secretary of the Interior. A careful examination,\r\nhowever, will show that this experience is the result of a just\r\ndiscrimination and will be far from affording encouragement to a\r\nreckless or indiscriminate extension of the principle.\r\n\r\nI commend to your favorable consideration the men of genius of our\r\ncountry who by their inventions and discoveries in science and arts have\r\ncontributed largely to the improvements of the age without, in many\r\ninstances, securing for themselves anything like an adequate reward.\r\nFor many interesting details upon this subject I refer you to the\r\nappropriate reports, and especially urge upon your early attention the\r\napparently slight, but really important, modifications of existing laws\r\ntherein suggested.\r\n\r\nThe liberal spirit which has so long marked the action of Congress in\r\nrelation to the District of Columbia will, I have no doubt, continue to\r\nbe manifested.\r\n\r\nThe erection of an asylum for the insane of the District of Columbia and\r\nof the Army and Navy of the United States has been somewhat retarded by\r\nthe great demand for materials and labor during the past summer, but\r\nfull preparation for the reception of patients before the return of\r\nanother winter is anticipated; and there is the best reason to believe,\r\nfrom the plan and contemplated arrangements which have been devised,\r\nwith the large experience furnished within the last few years in\r\nrelation to the nature and treatment of the disease, that it will prove\r\nan asylum indeed to this most helpless and afflicted class of sufferers\r\nand stand as a noble monument of wisdom and mercy.\r\n\r\nUnder the acts of Congress of August 31, 1852, and of March 3, 1853,\r\ndesigned to secure for the cities of Washington and Georgetown an\r\nabundant supply of good and wholesome water, it became my duty to\r\nexamine the report and plans of the engineer who had charge of the\r\nsurveys under the act first named. The best, if not the only, plan\r\ncalculated to secure permanently the object sought was that which\r\ncontemplates taking the water from the Great Falls of the Potomac,\r\nand consequently I gave to it my approval.\r\n\r\nFor the progress and present condition of this important work and for\r\nits demands so far as appropriations are concerned I refer you to the\r\nreport of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe present judicial system of the United States has now been in\r\noperation for so long a period of time and has in its general theory and\r\nmuch of its details become so familiar to the country and acquired so\r\nentirely the public confidence that if modified in any respect it should\r\nonly be in those particulars which may adapt it to the increased extent,\r\npopulation, and legal business of the United States. In this relation\r\nthe organization of the courts is now confessedly inadequate to the\r\nduties to be performed by them, in consequence of which the States of\r\nFlorida, Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas, and California, and districts of other\r\nStates, are in effect excluded from the full benefits of the general\r\nsystem by the functions of the circuit court being devolved on the\r\ndistrict judges in all those States or parts of States.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Constitution and a due regard to justice require\r\nthat all the States of the Union should be placed on the same footing\r\nin regard to the judicial tribunals. I therefore commend to your\r\nconsideration this important subject, which in my judgment demands the\r\nspeedy action of Congress. I will present to you, if deemed desirable,\r\na plan which I am prepared to recommend for the enlargement and\r\nmodification of the present judicial system.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution provided\r\nthat the President of the United States and other persons therein\r\ndesignated should constitute an \"establishment\" by that name, and that\r\nthe members should hold stated and special meetings for the supervision\r\nof the affairs of the Institution. The organization not having taken\r\nplace, it seemed to me proper that it should be effected without delay.\r\nThis has been done; and an occasion was thereby presented for inspecting\r\nthe condition of the Institution and appreciating its successful\r\nprogress thus far and its high promise of great and general usefulness.\r\n\r\nI have omitted to ask your favorable consideration for the estimates of\r\nworks of a local character in twenty-seven of the thirty-one States,\r\namounting to $1,754,500, because, independently of the grounds which\r\nhave so often been urged against the application of the Federal revenue\r\nfor works of this character, inequality, with consequent injustice, is\r\ninherent in the nature of the proposition, and because the plan has\r\nproved entirely inadequate to the accomplishment of the objects sought.\r\n\r\nThe subject of internal improvements, claiming alike the interest\r\nand good will of all, has, nevertheless, been the basis of much\r\npolitical discussion and has stood as a deep-graven line of division\r\nbetween statesmen of eminent ability and patriotism. The rule of strict\r\nconstruction of all powers delegated by the States to the General\r\nGovernment has arrayed itself from time to time against the rapid\r\nprogress of expenditures from the National Treasury on works of a local\r\ncharacter within the States. Memorable as an epoch in the history of\r\nthis subject is the message of President Jackson of the 27th of May,\r\n1830, which met the system of internal improvements in its comparative\r\ninfancy; but so rapid had been its growth that the projected\r\nappropriations in that year for works of this character had risen to\r\nthe alarming amount of more than $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn that message the President admitted the difficulty of bringing back\r\nthe operations of the Government to the construction of the Constitution\r\nset up in 1798, and marked it as an admonitory proof of the necessity of\r\nguarding that instrument with sleepless vigilance against the authority\r\nof precedents which had not the sanction of its most plainly defined\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nOur Government exists under a written compact between sovereign States,\r\nuniting for specific objects and with specific grants to their general\r\nagent. If, then, in the progress of its administration there have been\r\ndepartures from the terms and intent of the compact, it is and will ever\r\nbe proper to refer back to the fixed standard which our fathers left us\r\nand to make a stern effort to conform our action to it. It would seem\r\nthat the fact of a principle having been resisted from the first by many\r\nof the wisest and most patriotic men of the Republic, and a policy\r\nhaving provoked constant strife without arriving at a conclusion which\r\ncan be regarded as satisfactory to its most earnest advocates, should\r\nsuggest the inquiry whether there may not be a plan likely to be crowned\r\nby happier results. Without perceiving any sound distinction or\r\nintending to assert any principle as opposed to improvements needed for\r\nthe protection of internal commerce which does not equally apply to\r\nimprovements upon the seaboard for the protection of foreign commerce,\r\nI submit to you whether it may not be safely anticipated that if the\r\npolicy were once settled against appropriations by the General\r\nGovernment for local improvements for the benefit of commerce,\r\nlocalities requiring expenditures would not, by modes and means clearly\r\nlegitimate and proper, raise the fund necessary for such constructions\r\nas the safety or other interests of their commerce might require.\r\n\r\nIf that can be regarded as a system which in the experience of more than\r\nthirty years has at no time so commanded the public judgment as to give\r\nit the character of a settled policy; which, though it has produced some\r\nworks of conceded importance, has been attended with an expenditure\r\nquite disproportionate to their value and has resulted in squandering\r\nlarge sums upon objects which have answered no valuable purpose, the\r\ninterests of all the States require it to be abandoned unless hopes may\r\nbe indulged for the future which find no warrant in the past.\r\n\r\nWith an anxious desire for the completion of the works which are\r\nregarded by all good citizens with sincere interest, I have deemed it my\r\nduty to ask at your hands a deliberate reconsideration of the question,\r\nwith a hope that, animated by a desire to promote the permanent and\r\nsubstantial interests of the country, your wisdom may prove equal to the\r\ntask of devising and maturing a plan which, applied to this subject, may\r\npromise something better than constant strife, the suspension of the\r\npowers of local enterprise, the exciting of vain hopes, and the\r\ndisappointment of cherished expectations.\r\n\r\nIn expending the appropriations made by the last Congress several cases\r\nhave arisen in relation to works for the improvement of harbors which\r\ninvolve questions as to the right of soil and jurisdiction, and have\r\nthreatened conflict between the authority of the State and General\r\nGovernments. The right to construct a breakwater, jetty, or dam would\r\nseem necessarily to carry with it the power to protect and preserve such\r\nconstructions. This can only be effectually done by having jurisdiction\r\nover the soil. But no clause of the Constitution is found on which to\r\nrest the claim of the United States to exercise jurisdiction over the\r\nsoil of a State except that conferred by the eighth section of the first\r\narticle of the Constitution. It is, then, submitted whether, in all\r\ncases where constructions are to be erected by the General Government,\r\nthe right of soil should not first be obtained and legislative provision\r\nbe made to cover all such cases.\r\n\r\nFor the progress made in the construction of roads within the\r\nTerritories, as provided for in the appropriations of the last Congress,\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThere is one subject of a domestic nature which, from its intrinsic\r\nimportance and the many interesting questions of future policy which it\r\ninvolves, can not fail to receive your early attention. I allude to the\r\nmeans of communication by which different parts of the wide expanse of\r\nour country are to be placed in closer connection for purposes both\r\nof defense and commercial intercourse, and more especially such as\r\nappertain to the communication of those great divisions of the Union\r\nwhich lie on the opposite sides of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThat the Government has not been unmindful of this heretofore is\r\napparent from the aid it has afforded through appropriations for mail\r\nfacilities and other purposes. But the general subject will now present\r\nitself under aspects more imposing and more purely national by reason of\r\nthe surveys ordered by Congress, and now in the process of completion,\r\nfor communication by railway across the continent, and wholly within the\r\nlimits of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe power to declare war, to raise and support armies, to provide and\r\nmaintain a navy, and to call forth the militia to execute the laws,\r\nsuppress insurrections, and repel invasions was conferred upon Congress\r\nas means to provide for the common defense and to protect a territory\r\nand a population now widespread and vastly multiplied. As incidental to\r\nand indispensable for the exercise of this power, it must sometimes be\r\nnecessary to construct military roads and protect harbors of refuge.\r\nTo appropriations by Congress for such objects no sound objection can\r\nbe raised. Happily for our country, its peaceful policy and rapidly\r\nincreasing population impose upon us no urgent necessity for\r\npreparation, and leave but few trackless deserts between assailable\r\npoints and a patriotic people ever ready and generally able to protect\r\nthem. These necessary links the enterprise and energy of our people are\r\nsteadily and boldly struggling to supply. All experience affirms that\r\nwherever private enterprise will avail it is most wise for the General\r\nGovernment to leave to that and individual watchfulness the location and\r\nexecution of all means of communication.\r\n\r\nThe surveys before alluded to were designed to ascertain the most\r\npracticable and economical route for a railroad from the river\r\nMississippi to the Pacific Ocean. Parties are now in the field making\r\nexplorations, where previous examinations had not supplied sufficient\r\ndata and where there was the best reason to hope the object sought might\r\nbe found. The means and time being both limited, it is not to be\r\nexpected that all the accurate knowledge desired will be obtained, but\r\nit is hoped that much and important information will be added to the\r\nstock previously possessed, and that partial, if not full, reports of\r\nthe surveys ordered will be received in time for transmission to the two\r\nHouses of Congress on or before the first Monday in February next, as\r\nrequired by the act of appropriation. The magnitude of the enterprise\r\ncontemplated has aroused and will doubtless continue to excite a\r\nvery general interest throughout the country. In its political, its\r\ncommercial, and its military bearings it has varied, great, and\r\nincreasing claims to consideration. The heavy expense, the great delay,\r\nand, at times, fatality attending travel by either of the Isthmus routes\r\nhave demonstrated the advantage which would result from interterritorial\r\ncommunication by such safe and rapid means as a railroad would supply.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties, which have been encountered in a period of peace,\r\nwould be magnified and still further increased in time of war. But\r\nwhilst the embarrassments already encountered and others under new\r\ncontingencies to be anticipated may serve strikingly to exhibit the\r\nimportance of such a work, neither these nor all considerations combined\r\ncan have an appreciable value when weighed against the obligation\r\nstrictly to adhere to the Constitution and faithfully to execute the\r\npowers it confers.\r\n\r\nWithin this limit and to the extent of the interest of the Government\r\ninvolved it would seem both expedient and proper if an economical and\r\npracticable route shall be found to aid by all constitutional means\r\nin the construction of a road which will unite by speedy transit the\r\npopulations of the Pacific and Atlantic States. To guard against\r\nmisconception, it should be remarked that although the power to\r\nconstruct or aid in the construction of a road within the limits of\r\na Territory is not embarrassed by that question of jurisdiction which\r\nwould arise within the limits of a State, it is, nevertheless, held\r\nto be of doubtful power and more than doubtful propriety, even within\r\nthe limits of a Territory, for the General Government to undertake\r\nto administer the affairs of a railroad, a canal, or other similar\r\nconstruction, and therefore that its connection with a work of this\r\ncharacter should be incidental rather than primary. I will only add\r\nat present that, fully appreciating the magnitude of the subject and\r\nsolicitous that the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the Republic may be\r\nbound together by inseparable ties of common interest, as well as of\r\ncommon fealty and attachment to the Union, I shall be disposed, so far\r\nas my own action is concerned, to follow the lights of the Constitution\r\nas expounded and illustrated by those whose opinions and expositions\r\nconstitute the standard of my political faith in regard to the powers\r\nof the Federal Government. It is, I trust, not necessary to say that\r\nno grandeur of enterprise and no present urgent inducement promising\r\npopular favor will lead me to disregard those lights or to depart from\r\nthat path which experience has proved to be safe, and which is now\r\nradiant with the glow of prosperity and legitimate constitutional\r\nprogress. We can afford to wait, but we can not afford to overlook\r\nthe ark of our security.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my purpose to give prominence to any subject which may\r\nproperly be regarded as set at rest by the deliberate judgment of the\r\npeople. But while the present is bright with promise and the future full\r\nof demand and inducement for the exercise of active intelligence, the\r\npast can never be without useful lessons of admonition and instruction.\r\nIf its dangers serve not as beacons, they will evidently fail to fulfill\r\nthe object of a wise design. When the grave shall have closed over\r\nall who are now endeavoring to meet the obligations of duty, the year\r\n1850 will be recurred to as a period filled with anxious apprehension.\r\nA successful war had just terminated. Peace brought with it a vast\r\naugmentation of territory. Disturbing questions arose bearing upon the\r\ndomestic institutions of one portion of the Confederacy and involving\r\nthe constitutional rights of the States. But notwithstanding differences\r\nof opinion and sentiment which then existed in relation to details and\r\nspecific provisions, the acquiescence of distinguished citizens, whose\r\ndevotion to the Union can never be doubted, has given renewed vigor to\r\nour institutions and restored a sense of repose and security to the\r\npublic mind throughout the Confederacy. That this repose is to suffer\r\nno shock during my official term, if I have power to avert it, those\r\nwho placed me here may be assured. The wisdom of men who knew what\r\nindependence cost, who had put all at stake upon the issue of the\r\nRevolutionary struggle, disposed of the subject to which I refer in the\r\nonly way consistent with the Union of these States and with the march of\r\npower and prosperity which has made us what we are. It is a significant\r\nfact that from the adoption of the Constitution until the officers and\r\nsoldiers of the Revolution had passed to their graves, or, through the\r\ninfirmities of age and wounds, had ceased to participate actively in\r\npublic affairs, there was not merely a quiet acquiescence in, but a\r\nprompt vindication of, the constitutional rights of the States. The\r\nreserved powers were scrupulously respected. No statesman put forth the\r\nnarrow views of casuists to justify interference and agitation, but\r\nthe spirit of the compact was regarded as sacred in the eye of honor\r\nand indispensable for the great experiment of civil liberty, which,\r\nenvironed by inherent difficulties, was yet borne forward in apparent\r\nweakness by a power superior to all obstacles. There is no condemnation\r\nwhich the voice of freedom will not pronounce upon us should we prove\r\nfaithless to this great trust. While men inhabiting different parts of\r\nthis vast continent can no more be expected to hold the same opinions or\r\nentertain the same sentiments than every variety of climate or soil can\r\nbe expected to furnish the same agricultural products, they can unite\r\nin a common object and sustain common principles essential to the\r\nmaintenance of that object. The gallant men of the South and the North\r\ncould stand together during the struggle of the Revolution; they could\r\nstand together in the more trying period which succeeded the clangor of\r\narms. As their united valor was adequate to all the trials of the camp\r\nand dangers of the field, so their united wisdom proved equal to the\r\ngreater task of founding upon a deep and broad basis institutions which\r\nit has been our privilege to enjoy and will ever be our most sacred\r\nduty to sustain. It is but the feeble expression of a faith strong and\r\nuniversal to say that their sons, whose blood mingled so often upon the\r\nsame field during the War of 1812 and who have more recently borne in\r\ntriumph the flag of the country upon a foreign soil, will never permit\r\nalienation of feeling to weaken the power of their united efforts nor\r\ninternal dissensions to paralyze the great arm of freedom, uplifted for\r\nthe vindication of self-government.\r\n\r\nI have thus briefly presented such suggestions as seem to me especially\r\nworthy of your consideration. In providing for the present you can\r\nhardly fail to avail yourselves of the light which the experience of the\r\npast casts upon the future.\r\n\r\nThe growth of our population has now brought us, in the destined career\r\nof our national history, to a point at which it well behooves us to\r\nexpand our vision over the vast prospective.\r\n\r\nThe successive decennial returns of the census since the adoption of the\r\nConstitution have revealed a law of steady, progressive development,\r\nwhich may be stated in general terms as a duplication every quarter\r\ncentury. Carried forward from the point already reached for only a short\r\nperiod of time, as applicable to the existence of a nation, this law of\r\nprogress, if unchecked, will bring us to almost incredible results.\r\nA large allowance for a diminished proportional effect of emigration\r\nwould not very materially reduce the estimate, while the increased\r\naverage duration of human life known to have already resulted from the\r\nscientific and hygienic improvements of the past fifty years will tend\r\nto keep up through the next fifty, or perhaps hundred, the same ratio\r\nof growth which has been thus revealed in our past progress; and to the\r\ninfluence of these causes may be added the influx of laboring masses\r\nfrom eastern Asia to the Pacific side of our possessions, together\r\nwith the probable accession of the populations already existing in\r\nother parts of our hemisphere, which within the period in question will\r\nfeel with yearly increasing force the natural attraction of so vast,\r\npowerful, and prosperous a confederation of self-governing republics and\r\nwill seek the privilege of being admitted within its safe and happy\r\nbosom, transferring with themselves, by a peaceful and healthy process\r\nof incorporation, spacious regions of virgin and exuberant soil, which\r\nare destined to swarm with the fast-growing and fast-spreading millions\r\nof our race.\r\n\r\nThese considerations seem fully to justify the presumption that\r\nthe law of population above stated will continue to act with\r\nundiminished effect through at least the next half century, and that\r\nthousands of persons who have already arrived at maturity and are now\r\nexercising the rights of freemen will close their eyes on the spectacle\r\nof more than 100,000,000 of population embraced within the majestic\r\nproportions of the American Union. It is not merely as an interesting\r\ntopic of speculation that I present these views for your consideration.\r\nThey have important practical bearings upon all the political duties we\r\nare called upon to perform. Heretofore our system of government has\r\nworked on what may be termed a miniature scale in comparison with the\r\ndevelopment which it must thus assume within a future so near at hand\r\nas scarcely to be beyond the present of the existing generation.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a confederation so vast and so varied, both in\r\nnumbers and in territorial extent, in habits and in interests, could\r\nonly be kept in national cohesion by the strictest fidelity to the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution as understood by those who have adhered\r\nto the most restricted construction of the powers granted by the people\r\nand the States. Interpreted and applied according to those principles,\r\nthe great compact adapts itself with healthy ease and freedom to an\r\nunlimited extension of that benign system of federative self-government\r\nof which it is our glorious and, I trust, immortal charter. Let us,\r\nthen, with redoubled vigilance, be on our guard against yielding to the\r\ntemptation of the exercise of doubtful powers, even under the pressure\r\nof the motives of conceded temporary advantage and apparent temporary\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\nThe minimum of Federal government compatible with the maintenance of\r\nnational unity and efficient action in our relations with the rest of\r\nthe world should afford the rule and measure of construction of our\r\npowers under the general clauses of the Constitution. A spirit of strict\r\ndeference to the sovereign rights and dignity of every State, rather\r\nthan a disposition to subordinate the States into a provincial relation\r\nto the central authority, should characterize all our exercise of the\r\nrespective powers temporarily vested in us as a sacred trust from the\r\ngenerous confidence of our constituents.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, as a manifestly indispensable condition of the\r\nperpetuation of the Union and of the realization of that magnificent\r\nnational future adverted to, does the duty become yearly stronger and\r\nclearer upon us, as citizens of the several States, to cultivate a\r\nfraternal and affectionate spirit, language, and conduct in regard to\r\nother States and in relation to the varied interests, institutions, and\r\nhabits of sentiment and opinion which may respectively characterize\r\nthem. Mutual forbearance, respect, and noninterference in our personal\r\naction as citizens and an enlarged exercise of the most liberal\r\nprinciples of comity in the public dealings of State with State, whether\r\nin legislation or in the execution of laws, are the means to perpetuate\r\nthat confidence and fraternity the decay of which a mere political\r\nunion, on so vast a scale, could not long survive.\r\n\r\nIn still another point of view is an important practical duty suggested\r\nby this consideration of the magnitude of dimensions to which our\r\npolitical system, with its corresponding machinery of government,\r\nis so rapidly expanding. With increased vigilance does it require us\r\nto cultivate the cardinal virtues of public frugality and official\r\nintegrity and purity. Public affairs ought to be so conducted that a\r\nsettled conviction shall pervade the entire Union that nothing short of\r\nthe highest tone and standard of public morality marks every part of\r\nthe administration and legislation of the General Government. Thus will\r\nthe federal system, whatever expansion time and progress may give it,\r\ncontinue more and more deeply rooted in the love and confidence of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThat wise economy which is as far removed from parsimony as from corrupt\r\nand corrupting extravagance; that single regard for the public good\r\nwhich will frown upon all attempts to approach the Treasury with\r\ninsidious projects of private interest cloaked under public pretexts;\r\nthat sound fiscal administration which, in the legislative department,\r\nguards against the dangerous temptations incident to overflowing\r\nrevenue, and, in the executive, maintains an unsleeping watchfulness\r\nagainst the tendency of all national expenditure to extravagance, while\r\nthey are admitted elementary political duties, may, I trust, be deemed\r\nas properly adverted to and urged in view of the more impressive sense\r\nof that necessity which is directly suggested by the considerations now\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the Vice-President of the United\r\nStates has passed from the scenes of earth, without having entered upon\r\nthe duties of the station to which he had been called by the voice of\r\nhis countrymen. Having occupied almost continuously for more than thirty\r\nyears a seat in one or the other of the two Houses of Congress, and\r\nhaving by his singular purity and wisdom secured unbounded confidence\r\nand universal respect, his failing health was watched by the nation\r\nwith painful solicitude. His loss to the country, under all the\r\ncircumstances, has been justly regarded as irreparable.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress of March 2, 1853, the oath of\r\noffice was administered to him on the 24th of that month at Ariadne\r\nestate, near Matanzas, in the island of Cuba; but his strength gradually\r\ndeclined, and was hardly sufficient to enable him to return to his home\r\nin Alabama, where, on the 18th day of April, in the most calm and\r\npeaceful way, his long and eminently useful career was terminated.\r\n\r\nEntertaining unlimited confidence in your intelligent and patriotic\r\ndevotion to the public interest, and being conscious of no motives on\r\nmy part which are not inseparable from the honor and advancement of my\r\ncountry, I hope it may be my privilege to deserve and secure not only\r\nyour cordial cooperation in great public measures, but also those\r\nrelations of mutual confidence and regard which it is always so\r\ndesirable to cultivate between members of coordinate branches of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1853_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United

Certain amendments are proposed to\r\nthe instrument, as hereinafter specified, viz:\r\n\r\nIn order to make the duties and obligations stipulated in the second\r\narticle reciprocal, it is proposed to add to that article the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  And the Government of Mexico agrees that the stipulations contained in\r\n  this article to be performed by the United States shall be reciprocal,\r\n  and Mexico shall be under like obligations to the United States and the\r\n  citizens thereof as those hereinabove imposed on the latter in favor of\r\n  the Republic of Mexico and Mexican citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended that for the third article of the original treaty\r\nthe following shall be adopted as a substitute:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In consideration of the grants received by the United States and the\r\n  obligations relinquished by the Mexican Republic pursuant to this\r\n  treaty, the former agree to pay to the latter the sum of $15,000,000\r\n  in gold or silver coin at the Treasury at Washington, one-fifth of\r\n  the amount on the exchange of ratifications of the present treaty at\r\n  Washington and the remaining four-fifths in monthly installments of\r\n  three millions each, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum\r\n  until the whole be paid, the Government of the United States reserving\r\n  the right to pay up the whole sum of fifteen millions at an earlier\r\n  date, as may be to it convenient.\r\n\r\n  The United States also agree to assume all the claims of their citizens\r\n  against the Mexican Republic which may have arisen under treaty or\r\n  the law of nations since the date of the signature of the treaty of\r\n  Guadalupe, and the Mexican Republic agrees to exonerate the United\r\n  States of America from all claims of Mexico or Mexican citizens which\r\n  may have arisen under treaty or the law of nations since the date of\r\n  the treaty of Guadalupe, so that each Government, in the most formal\r\n  and effective manner, shall be exempted and exonerated of all such\r\n  obligations to each other respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also recommend that the eighth article be modified by striking out all\r\nafter the word \"attempts\" in the twenty-third line of that article. The\r\npart to be omitted is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  They mutually and especially obligate themselves, in all cases of such\r\n  lawless enterprises which may not have been prevented through the civil\r\n  authorities before formation, to aid with the naval and military forces,\r\n  on due notice being given by the aggrieved party of the aggressions of\r\n  the citizens and subjects of the other, so that the lawless adventurers\r\n  may be pursued and overtaken on the high seas, their elements of war\r\n  destroyed, and the deluded captives held responsible in their persons\r\n  and meet with the merited retribution inflicted by the laws of nations\r\n  against all such disturbers of the peace and happiness of contiguous and\r\n  friendly powers. It being understood that in all cases of successful\r\n  pursuit and capture the delinquents so captured shall be judged and\r\n  punished by the government of that nation to which the vessel capturing\r\n  them may belong, conformably to the laws of each nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the instrument it will also be advisable to substitute\r\n\"seventy-eighth\" for \"seventy-seventh\" year of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 13, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, an additional article to the convention for the\r\nestablishment of international copyright, which was concluded at\r\nWashington on the 17th of February, 1853, between the United States of\r\nAmerica and Her Britannic Majesty, extending the time limited in that\r\nconvention for the exchange of the ratifications of the same.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments[7] therein referred to, in compliance with the resolution of\r\nthe Senate of the 13th instant.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Relating to the repair of the United States frigate\r\n_Susquehanna_ at Rio de Janeiro.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying documents,[8] in compliance with their resolution of the 2d\r\nultimo.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Communications from the American legation at Constantinople\r\nrespecting the seizure of Martin Koszta by Austrian authorities at\r\nSmyrna.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 13th instant, requesting information respecting negotiations with\r\nPeru for the removal of restrictions upon the exportation of guano,\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\ncorrespondence therein referred to.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nof the 23d January last, \"that the President of the United States\r\nbe respectfully requested to furnish this House with copies of all\r\ncontracts made by and correspondence subsequently with the Chief of\r\nthe Bureau of Topographical Engineers for furnishing materials of wood\r\nand stone for improving the harbors and rivers on Lake Michigan, under\r\nand by virtue of the act making appropriations for the improvement of\r\ncertain harbors and rivers,\" approved August 30, 1852, I transmit\r\na letter of the Secretary of War submitting a report of the Colonel\r\nof Topographical Engineers inclosing copies of the contracts and\r\ncorrespondence called for.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 7th of December last,\r\nrequesting me to present to the Senate the plan referred to in my annual\r\nmessage to Congress, and recommended therein, for the enlargement and\r\nmodification of the present judicial system of the United States,\r\nI transmit a report from the Attorney-General, to whom the resolution\r\nwas referred.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Attorney-General, in answer to\r\nthe resolutions of the House of the 22d of December, requesting me to\r\ncommunicate to the House the plan for the modification and enlargement\r\nof the judicial system of the United States, recommended in my annual\r\nmessage to Congress.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 7, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments[9] therein referred to, in answer to the resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 26th March, 1853.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Correspondence with R.C.

West in the island of Cuba.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 14, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn transmitting to the Senate the report of the Secretary of\r\nState, together with the documents therein referred to, being the\r\ncorrespondence called for by the resolution of that body of the 9th of\r\nJanuary last, I deem it proper to state briefly the reasons which have\r\ndeterred me from sending to the Senate for ratification the proposed\r\nconvention between the United States of America and the United Mexican\r\nStates, concluded by the respective plenipotentiaries of the two\r\nGovernments on the 21st day of March, 1853, on the subject of a transit\r\nway across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.\r\n\r\nWithout adverting to the want of authority on the part of the American\r\nminister to conclude any such convention, or to the action of this\r\nGovernment in relation to the rights of certain of its citizens under\r\nthe grant for a like object originally made to Josè Garay, the\r\nobjections to it upon its face are numerous, and should, in my judgment,\r\nbe regarded as conclusive.\r\n\r\nProminent among these objections is the fact that the convention binds\r\nus to a foreign Government, to guarantee the contract of a private\r\ncompany with that Government for the construction of the contemplated\r\ntransit way, \"to protect the persons engaged and property employed in\r\nthe construction of the said work from the commencement thereof to\r\nits completion against all confiscation, spoliation, or violence of\r\nwhatsoever nature,\" and to guarantee the entire security of the capital\r\ninvested therein during the continuance of the contract. Such is the\r\nsubstance of the second and third articles.\r\n\r\nHence it will be perceived that the obligations which this Government is\r\nasked to assume are not to terminate in a few years, or even with the\r\npresent generation.\r\n\r\nAnd again: \"If the regulations which may be prescribed concerning the\r\ntraffic on said transit way shall be clearly contrary to the spirit and\r\nintention of this convention,\" even then this Government is not to be at\r\nliberty to withdraw its \"protection and guaranty\" without first giving\r\none year's notice to the Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nWhen the fact is duly considered that the responsibility of this\r\nGovernment is thus pledged for a long series of years to the interests\r\nof a private company established for purposes of internal improvement,\r\nin a foreign country, and that country peculiarly subject to civil wars\r\nand other public vicissitudes, it will be seen how comprehensive and\r\nembarrassing would be those engagements to the Government of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNot less important than this objection is the consideration that the\r\nUnited States can not agree to the terms of this convention without\r\ndisregarding the provisions of the eighth article of the convention\r\nwhich this Government entered into with Great Britain on April 19, 1850,\r\nwhich expressly includes any interoceanic communication whatever by the\r\nIsthmus of Tehuantepec. However inconvenient may be the conditions of\r\nthat convention, still they exist, and the obligations of good faith\r\nrest alike upon the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWithout enlarging upon these and other questionable features of the\r\nproposed convention which will suggest themselves to your minds, I will\r\nonly add that after the most careful consideration I have deemed it my\r\nduty not to ask for its ratification by the Senate.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 15, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n10th instant, I herewith transmit a report of the Secretary of State,\r\ncontaining all the information received at the Department in relation to\r\nthe seizure of the _Black Warrior_ at Havana on the 28th ultimo.\r\n\r\nThere have been in the course of a few years past many other instances\r\nof aggression upon our commerce, violations of the rights of American\r\ncitizens, and insults to the national flag by the Spanish authorities in\r\nCuba, and all attempts to obtain redress have led to protracted, and as\r\nyet fruitless, negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe documents in these cases are voluminous, and when prepared will be\r\nsent to Congress.\r\n\r\nThose now transmitted relate exclusively to the seizure of the _Black\r\nWarrior_, and present so clear a case of wrong that it would be\r\nreasonable to expect full indemnity therefor as soon as this\r\nunjustifiable and offensive conduct shall be made known to Her Catholic\r\nMajesty's Government; but similar expectations in other cases have not\r\nbeen realized.\r\n\r\nThe offending party is at our doors with large powers for aggression,\r\nbut none, it is alleged, for reparation. The source of redress is in\r\nanother hemisphere, and the answers to our just complaints made to the\r\nhome Government are but the repetition of excuses rendered by inferior\r\nofficials to their superiors in reply to representations of misconduct.\r\nThe peculiar situation of the parties has undoubtedly much aggravated\r\nthe annoyances and injuries which our citizens have suffered from the\r\nCuban authorities, and Spain does not seem to appreciate to its full\r\nextent her responsibility for the conduct of these authorities. In\r\ngiving very extraordinary powers to them she owes it to justice and\r\nto her friendly relations with this Government to guard with great\r\nvigilance against the exorbitant exercise of these powers, and in case\r\nof injuries to provide for prompt redress.\r\n\r\nI have already taken measures to present to the Government of Spain the\r\nwanton injury of the Cuban authorities in the detention and seizure of\r\nthe _Black Warrior_, and to demand immediate indemnity for the injury\r\nwhich has thereby resulted to our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn view of the position of the island of Cuba, its proximity to our\r\ncoast, the relations which it must ever bear to our commercial and\r\nother interests, it is vain to expect that a series of unfriendly\r\nacts infringing our commercial rights and the adoption of a policy\r\nthreatening the honor and security of these States can long consist\r\nwith peaceful relations.\r\n\r\nIn case the measures taken for amicable adjustment of our difficulties\r\nwith Spain should, unfortunately, fail, I shall not hesitate to use the\r\nauthority and means which Congress may grant to insure the observance of\r\nour just rights, to obtain redress for injuries received, and to\r\nvindicate the honor of our flag.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of that contingency, which I earnestly hope may not\r\narise, I suggest to Congress the propriety of adopting such provisional\r\nmeasures as the exigency may seem to demand.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 17, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the Senate herewith, for its constitutional action, two\r\ntreaties recently negotiated by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, as\r\ncommissioner on the part of the United States, with the delegates now at\r\nthe seat of Government representing the confederated tribes of Otoes and\r\nMissourias and the Omaha Indians, for the extinguishment of their titles\r\nto lands west of the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 18. 1854_.\r\n\r\nHon.

relative to the claims of the Mexican Government\r\nand of citizens of the Mexican Republic on this Government, and of\r\ncitizens of the United States on the Government of that Republic, I\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of State, to whom the resolution\r\nwas referred.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 31, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United

ultimo.\r\n\r\nThat part of the document which purports to recite my official\r\ninstructions is strictly correct; that which is avowedly unofficial and\r\nunauthorized, it can hardly be necessary for me to say, in view of the\r\ndocuments already before the Senate, does not convey a correct\r\nimpression of my \"views and wishes.\"\r\n\r\nAt no time after an intention was entertained of sending Mr. Ward as\r\nspecial agent to Mexico was either the Garay grant or the convention\r\nentered into by Mr. Conkling alluded to otherwise than as subjects which\r\nmight embarrass the negotiation of the treaty, and were consequently not\r\nincluded in the instructions.\r\n\r\nWhile the departure of Mr. Ward, under any circumstances or in any\r\nrespect, from the instructions committed to him is a matter of regret,\r\nit is just to say that, although he failed to convey in his letter to\r\nGeneral Gadsden the correct import of remarks made by me anterior to his\r\nappointment as special agent, I impute to him no design of\r\nmisrepresentation.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 5, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a

But I am\r\nconstrained to say that such is not the fact. The formal demand for\r\nimmediate reparation in the case of the _Black Warrior_, instead of\r\nhaving been met on the part of Spain by prompt satisfaction, has only\r\nserved to call forth a justification of the local authorities of Cuba,\r\nand thus to transfer the responsibility for their acts to the Spanish\r\nGovernment itself.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile information, not only reliable in its nature, but of an\r\nofficial character, was received to the effect that preparation was\r\nmaking within the limits of the United States by private individuals\r\nunder military organization for a descent upon the island of Cuba with\r\na view to wrest that colony from the dominion of Spain. International\r\ncomity, the obligations of treaties, and the express provisions of law\r\nalike required, in my judgment, that all the constitutional power of\r\nthe Executive should be exerted to prevent the consummation of such a\r\nviolation of positive law and of that good faith on which mainly the\r\namicable relations of neighboring nations must depend. In conformity\r\nwith these convictions of public duty, a proclamation was issued to warn\r\nall persons not to participate in the contemplated enterprise and to\r\ninvoke the interposition in this behalf of the proper officers of the\r\nGovernment. No provocation whatever can justify private expeditions of\r\nhostility against a country at peace with the United States. The power\r\nto declare war is vested by the Constitution in Congress, and the\r\nexperience of our past history leaves no room to doubt that the wisdom\r\nof this arrangement of constitutional power will continue to be verified\r\nwhenever the national interest and honor shall demand a resort to\r\nultimate measures of redress. Pending negotiations by the Executive,\r\nand before the action of Congress, individuals could not be permitted\r\nto embarrass the operations of the one and usurp the powers of the other\r\nof these depositaries of the functions of Government.\r\n\r\nI have only to add that nothing has arisen since the date of my former\r\nmessage to \"dispense with the suggestions therein contained touching the\r\npropriety of provisional measures by Congress.\"\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 2, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of State, with the\r\naccompanying documents,[32] in answer to the resolution of the Senate\r\nof the 5th ultimo.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Correspondence relative to the imprisonment of George\r\nMarsden and to the seizure of the cargo of the American bark _Griffon_\r\nby the authorities of Brazil.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 2, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to you a copy of a treaty between the United States\r\nand Great Britain, negotiated at Washington on the 5th of June last.\r\nIt has been concurred in by the Senate, and I have no doubt that the\r\nratifications of it will be soon exchanged.

That 10,000,000 acres of land be granted to the several States,\r\nto be apportioned among them in the compound ratio of the geographical\r\narea and representation of said States in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nSecond. That wherever there are public lands in a State subject to sale\r\nat the regular price of private entry, the proportion of said 10,000,000\r\nacres falling to such State shall be selected from such lands within it,\r\nand that to the States in which there are no such public lands land\r\nscrip shall be issued to the amount of their distributive shares,\r\nrespectively, said scrip not to be entered by said States, but to be\r\nsold by them and subject to entry by their assignees: _Provided_, That\r\nnone of it shall be sold at less than $1 per acre, under penalty of\r\nforfeiture of the same to the United States.\r\n\r\nThird. That the expenses of the management and superintendence of said\r\nlands and of the moneys received therefrom shall be paid by the States\r\nto which they may belong out of the treasury of said States.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the gross proceeds of the sales of such lands or land scrip\r\nso granted shall be invested by the several States in safe stocks, to\r\nconstitute a perpetual fund, the principal of which shall remain forever\r\nundiminished, and the interest to be appropriated to the maintenance of\r\nthe indigent insane within the several States.\r\n\r\nFifth. That annual returns of lands or scrip sold shall be made by the\r\nStates to the Secretary of the Interior, and the whole grant be subject\r\nto certain conditions and limitations prescribed in the bill, to be\r\nassented to by legislative acts of said States.\r\n\r\nThis bill therefore proposes that the Federal Government shall make\r\nprovision to the amount of the value of 10,000,000 acres of land for an\r\neleemosynary object within the several States, to be administered by the\r\npolitical authority of the same; and it presents at the threshold the\r\nquestion whether any such act on the part of the Federal Government\r\nis warranted and sanctioned by the Constitution, the provisions and\r\nprinciples of which are to be protected and sustained as a first and\r\nparamount duty.\r\n\r\nIt can not be questioned that if Congress has power to make provision\r\nfor the indigent insane without the limits of this District it has the\r\nsame power to provide for the indigent who are not insane, and thus\r\nto transfer to the Federal Government the charge of all the poor in\r\nall the States. It has the same power to provide hospitals and other\r\nlocal establishments for the care and cure of every species of human\r\ninfirmity, and thus to assume all that duty of either public\r\nphilanthropy or public necessity to the dependent, the orphan, the\r\nsick, or the needy which is now discharged by the States themselves\r\nor by corporate institutions or private endowments existing under the\r\nlegislation of the States. The whole field of public beneficence is\r\nthrown open to the care and culture of the Federal Government. Generous\r\nimpulses no longer encounter the limitations and control of our\r\nimperious fundamental law; for however worthy may be the present object\r\nin itself, it is only one of a class. It is not exclusively worthy of\r\nbenevolent regard. Whatever considerations dictate sympathy for this\r\nparticular object apply in like manner, if not in the same degree, to\r\nidiocy, to physical disease, to extreme destitution. If Congress may\r\nand ought to provide for any one of these objects, it may and ought to\r\nprovide for them all. And if it be done in this case, what answer shall\r\nbe given when Congress shall be called upon, as it doubtless will be, to\r\npursue a similar course of legislation in the others? It will obviously\r\nbe vain to reply that the object is worthy, but that the application has\r\ntaken a wrong direction. The power will have been deliberately assumed,\r\nthe general obligation will by this act have been acknowledged, and the\r\nquestion of means and expediency will alone be left for consideration.\r\nThe decision upon the principle in any one case determines it for the\r\nwhole class. The question presented, therefore, clearly is upon the\r\nconstitutionality and propriety of the Federal Government assuming\r\nto enter into a novel and vast field of legislation, namely, that of\r\nproviding for the care and support of all those among the people of the\r\nUnited States who by any form of calamity become fit objects of public\r\nphilanthropy.\r\n\r\nI readily and, I trust, feelingly acknowledge the duty incumbent on us\r\nall as men and citizens, and as among the highest and holiest of our\r\nduties, to provide for those who, in the mysterious order of Providence,\r\nare subject to want and to disease of body or mind; but I can not find\r\nany authority in the Constitution for making the Federal Government the\r\ngreat almoner of public charity throughout the United States. To do so\r\nwould, in my judgment, be contrary to the letter and spirit of the\r\nConstitution and subversive of the whole theory upon which the Union of\r\nthese States is founded. And if it were admissible to contemplate the\r\nexercise of this power for any object whatever, I can not avoid the\r\nbelief that it would in the end be prejudicial rather than beneficial in\r\nthe noble offices of charity to have the charge of them transferred from\r\nthe States to the Federal Government. Are we not too prone to forget\r\nthat the Federal Union is the creature of the States, not they of\r\nthe Federal Union? We were the inhabitants of colonies distinct in\r\nlocal government one from the other before the Revolution. By that\r\nRevolution the colonies each became an independent State. They achieved\r\nthat independence and secured its recognition by the agency of a\r\nconsulting body, which, from being an assembly of the ministers of\r\ndistinct sovereignties instructed to agree to no form of government\r\nwhich did not leave the domestic concerns of each State to itself, was\r\nappropriately denominated a Congress. When, having tried the experiment\r\nof the Confederation, they resolved to change that for the present\r\nFederal Union, and thus to confer on the Federal Government more ample\r\nauthority, they scrupulously measured such of the functions of their\r\ncherished sovereignty as they chose to delegate to the General\r\nGovernment. With this aim and to this end the fathers of the Republic\r\nframed the Constitution, in and by which the independent and sovereign\r\nStates united themselves for certain specified objects and purposes, and\r\nfor those only, leaving all powers not therein set forth as conferred on\r\none or another of the three great departments--the legislative, the\r\nexecutive, and the judicial--indubitably with the States. And when the\r\npeople of the several States had in their State conventions, and thus\r\nalone, given effect and force to the Constitution, not content that any\r\ndoubt should in future arise as to the scope and character of this act,\r\nthey ingrafted thereon the explicit declaration that \"the powers not\r\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by\r\nit to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the\r\npeople.\" Can it be controverted that the great mass of the business\r\nof Government--that involved in the social relations, the internal\r\narrangements of the body politic, the mental and moral culture of men,\r\nthe development of local resources of wealth, the punishment of crimes\r\nin general, the preservation of order, the relief of the needy or\r\notherwise unfortunate members of society--did in practice remain with\r\nthe States; that none of these objects of local concern are by the\r\nConstitution expressly or impliedly prohibited to the States, and that\r\nnone of them are by any express language of the Constitution transferred\r\nto the United States? Can it be claimed that any of these functions\r\nof local administration and legislation are vested in the Federal\r\nGovernment by any implication? I have never found anything in the\r\nConstitution which is susceptible of such a construction. No one of\r\nthe enumerated powers touches the subject or has even a remote analogy\r\nto it. The powers conferred upon the United States have reference to\r\nfederal relations, or to the means of accomplishing or executing things\r\nof federal relation. So also of the same character are the powers taken\r\naway from the States by enumeration. In either case the powers granted\r\nand the powers restricted were so granted or so restricted only where\r\nit was requisite for the maintenance of peace and harmony between the\r\nStates or for the purpose of protecting their common interests and\r\ndefending their common sovereignty against aggression from abroad or\r\ninsurrection at home.\r\n\r\nI shall not discuss at length the question of power sometimes claimed\r\nfor the General Government under the clause of the eighth section of the\r\nConstitution, which gives Congress the power \"to lay and collect taxes,\r\nduties, imposts, and excises, to pay debts and provide for the common\r\ndefense and general welfare of the United States,\" because if it has not\r\nalready been settled upon sound reason and authority it never will be.\r\nI take the received and just construction of that article, as if written\r\nto lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises _in order_ to pay\r\nthe debts and _in order_ to provide for the common defense and general\r\nwelfare. It is not a substantive general power to provide for the\r\nwelfare of the United States, but is a limitation on the grant of power\r\nto raise money by taxes, duties, and imposts. If it were otherwise, all\r\nthe rest of the Constitution, consisting of carefully enumerated and\r\ncautiously guarded grants of specific powers, would have been useless,\r\nif not delusive. It would be impossible in that view to escape from the\r\nconclusion that these were inserted only to mislead for the present,\r\nand, instead of enlightening and defining the pathway of the future,\r\nto involve its action in the mazes of doubtful construction. Such a\r\nconclusion the character of the men who framed that sacred instrument\r\nwill never permit us to form. Indeed, to suppose it susceptible of any\r\nother construction would be to consign all the rights of the States and\r\nof the people of the States to the mere discretion of Congress, and thus\r\nto clothe the Federal Government with authority to control the sovereign\r\nStates, by which they would have been dwarfed into provinces or\r\ndepartments and all sovereignty vested in an absolute consolidated\r\ncentral power, against which the spirit of liberty has so often and\r\nin so many countries struggled in vain. In my judgment you can not by\r\ntributes to humanity make any adequate compensation for the wrong you\r\nwould inflict by removing the sources of power and political action from\r\nthose who are to be thereby affected. If the time shall ever arrive\r\nwhen, for an object appealing, however strongly, to our sympathies,\r\nthe dignity of the States shall bow to the dictation of Congress by\r\nconforming their legislation thereto, when the power and majesty and\r\nhonor of those who created shall become subordinate to the thing of\r\ntheir creation, I but feebly utter my apprehensions when I express\r\nmy firm conviction that we shall see \"the beginning of the end.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately, we are not left in doubt as to the purpose of the\r\nConstitution any more than as to its express language, for although the\r\nhistory of its formation, as recorded in the Madison Papers, shows that\r\nthe Federal Government in its present form emerged from the conflict of\r\nopposing influences which have continued to divide statesmen from that\r\nday to this, yet the rule of clearly defined powers and of strict\r\nconstruction presided over the actual conclusion and subsequent adoption\r\nof the Constitution. President Madison, in the Federalist, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution are few and defined.\r\n  Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and\r\n  indefinite. ... Its [the General Government's] jurisdiction extends to\r\n  certain enumerated objects only, and leaves to the several States a\r\n  residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit President Jefferson invokes \"the support of\r\nthe State governments in all their rights as the most competent\r\nadministrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks\r\nagainst anti-republican tendencies;\" and President Jackson said that our\r\ntrue strength and wisdom are not promoted by invasions of the rights and\r\npowers of the several States, but that, on the contrary, they consist\r\n\"not in binding the States more closely to the center, but in leaving\r\neach more unobstructed in its proper orbit.\"\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution, in refusing to confer on the Federal\r\nGovernment any jurisdiction over these purely local objects, in my\r\njudgment manifested a wise forecast and broad comprehension of the true\r\ninterests of these objects themselves. It is clear that public charities\r\nwithin the States can be efficiently administered only by their\r\nauthority. The bill before me concedes this, for it does not commit the\r\nfunds it provides to the administration of any other authority.\r\n\r\nI can not but repeat what I have before expressed, that if the several\r\nStates, many of which have already laid the foundation of munificent\r\nestablishments of local beneficence, and nearly all of which are\r\nproceeding to establish them, shall be led to suppose, as, should this\r\nbill become a law, they will be, that Congress is to make provision for\r\nsuch objects, the fountains of charity will be dried up at home, and the\r\nseveral States, instead of bestowing their own means on the social wants\r\nof their own people, may themselves, through the strong temptation which\r\nappeals to states as to individuals, become humble suppliants for the\r\nbounty of the Federal Government, reversing their true relations to\r\nthis Union.\r\n\r\nHaving stated my views of the limitation of the powers conferred by\r\nthe eighth section of the first article of the Constitution, I deem it\r\nproper to call attention to the third section of the fourth article\r\nand to the provisions of the sixth article bearing directly upon\r\nthe question under consideration, which, instead of aiding the claim\r\nto power exercised in this case, tend, it is believed, strongly to\r\nillustrate and explain positions which, even without such support,\r\nI can not regard as questionable. The third section of the fourth\r\narticle of the Constitution is in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Congress shall have power to _dispose_ of and make all needful rules\r\n  and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging\r\n  to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so\r\n  construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States or of any\r\n  particular State.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sixth article is as follows, to wit, that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  All debts contracted and engagements entered into before the adoption of\r\n  this Constitution shall be as valid against the United States under this\r\n  Constitution as under the Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a correct understanding of the terms used in the third section of\r\nthe fourth article, above quoted, reference should be had to the history\r\nof the times in which the Constitution was formed and adopted. It was\r\ndecided upon in convention on the 17th September, 1787, and by it\r\nCongress was empowered \"to dispose of,\" etc., \"the territory or other\r\nproperty belonging to the United States.\" The only territory then\r\nbelonging to the United States was that then recently ceded by the\r\nseveral States, to wit: By New York in 1781, by Virginia in 1784, by\r\nMassachusetts in 1785, and by South Carolina in August, 1787, only\r\nthe month before the formation of the Constitution. The cession from\r\nVirginia contained the following provision:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That all the lands within the territory so ceded to the United States,\r\n  and not reserved for or appropriated to any of the before-mentioned\r\n  purposes or disposed of in bounties to the officers and soldiers of the\r\n  American Army, shall be considered a common fund for the use and benefit\r\n  of such of the United States as have become or shall become members of\r\n  the Confederation or Federal Alliance of the said States, Virginia\r\n  included, according to their usual respective proportions in the general\r\n  charge and expenditure, and shall be faithfully and _bona fide disposed\r\n  of_ for that purpose and for no other use or purpose whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the object for which these lands are to be disposed of is clearly\r\nset forth, and the power to dispose of them granted by the third section\r\nof the fourth article of the Constitution clearly contemplates such\r\ndisposition only. If such be the fact, and in my mind there can be no\r\ndoubt of it, then you have again not only no implication in favor of the\r\ncontemplated grant, but the strongest authority against it. Furthermore,\r\nthis bill is in violation of the faith of the Government pledged in the\r\nact of January 28, 1847. The nineteenth section of that act declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That for the payment of the stock which may be created under the\r\n  provisions of this act the sales of the public lands are hereby pledged;\r\n  and it is hereby made the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to use\r\n  and apply all moneys which may be received into the Treasury for the\r\n  sales of the public lands after the 1st day of January, 1848, first,\r\n  to pay the interest on all stocks issued by virtue of this act, and,\r\n  secondly, to use the balance of said receipts, after paying the interest\r\n  aforesaid, in the purchase of said stocks at their market value, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe debts then contracted have not been liquidated, and the language of\r\nthis section and the obligations of the United States under it are too\r\nplain to need comment.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to discover any distinction on constitutional grounds\r\nor grounds of expediency between an appropriation of $10,000,000\r\ndirectly from the money in the Treasury for the object contemplated and\r\nthe appropriation of lands presented for my sanction, and yet I can not\r\ndoubt that if the bill proposed $10,000,000 from the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States for the support of the indigent insane in the several\r\nStates that the constitutional question involved in the act would have\r\nattracted forcibly the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nI respectfully submit that in a constitutional point of view it is\r\nwholly immaterial whether the appropriation be in money or in land.\r\n\r\nThe public domain is the common property of the Union just as much as\r\nthe surplus proceeds of that and of duties on imports remaining\r\nunexpended in the Treasury. As such it has been pledged, is now pledged,\r\nand may need to be so pledged again for public indebtedness.\r\n\r\nAs property it is distinguished from actual money chiefly in this\r\nrespect, that its profitable management sometimes requires that portions\r\nof it be appropriated to local objects in the States wherein it may\r\nhappen to lie, as would be done by any prudent proprietor to enhance the\r\nsale value of his private domain. All such grants of land are in fact\r\na disposal of it for value received, but they afford no precedent or\r\nconstitutional reason for giving away the public lands. Still less do\r\nthey give sanction to appropriations for objects which have not been\r\nintrusted to the Federal Government, and therefore belong exclusively\r\nto the States.\r\n\r\nTo assume that the public lands are applicable to ordinary State\r\nobjects, whether of public structures, police, charity, or expenses of\r\nState administration, would be to disregard to the amount of the value\r\nof the public lands all the limitations of the Constitution and confound\r\nto that extent all distinctions between the rights and powers of the\r\nStates and those of the United States; for if the public lands may be\r\napplied to the support of the poor, whether sane or insane, if the\r\ndisposal of them and their proceeds be not subject to the ordinary\r\nlimitations of the Constitution, then Congress possesses unqualified\r\npower to provide for expenditures in the States by means of the public\r\nlands, even to the degree of defraying the salaries of governors,\r\njudges, and all other expenses of the government and internal\r\nadministration within the several States.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion from the general survey of the whole subject is to\r\nmy mind irresistible, and closes the question both of right and of\r\nexpediency so far as regards the principle of the appropriation proposed\r\nin this bill. Would not the admission of such power in Congress to\r\ndispose of the public domain work the practical abrogation of some\r\nof the most important provisions of the Constitution?\r\n\r\nIf the systematic reservation of a definite portion of the public lands\r\n(the sixteenth sections) in the States for the purposes of education and\r\noccasional grants for similar purposes be cited as contradicting these\r\nconclusions, the answer as it appears to me is obvious and satisfactory.\r\nSuch reservations and grants, besides being a part of the conditions on\r\nwhich the proprietary right of the United States is maintained, along\r\nwith the eminent domain of a particular State, and by which the public\r\nland remains free from taxation in the State in which it lies as long\r\nas it remains the property of the United States, are the acts of a mere\r\nlandowner disposing of a small share of his property in a way to augment\r\nthe value of the residue and in this mode to encourage the early\r\noccupation of it by the industrious and intelligent pioneer.\r\n\r\nThe great example of apparent donation of lands to the States likely\r\nto be relied upon as sustaining the principles of this bill is the\r\nrelinquishment of swamp lands to the States in which they are situated,\r\nbut this also, like other grants already referred to, was based\r\nexpressly upon grounds clearly distinguishable in principle from any\r\nwhich can be assumed for the bill herewith returned, viz, upon the\r\ninterest and duty of the proprietor. They were charged, and not without\r\nreason, to be a nuisance to the inhabitants of the surrounding country.\r\nThe measure was predicated not only upon the ground of the disease\r\ninflicted upon the people of the States, which the United States could\r\nnot justify as a just and honest proprietor, but also upon an express\r\nlimitation of the application of the proceeds in the first instance\r\nto purposes of levees and drains, thus protecting the health of the\r\ninhabitants and at the same time enhancing the value of the remaining\r\nlands belonging to the General Government.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be denied that Congress, while administering the public\r\nlands as a proprietor within the principle distinctly announced in my\r\nannual message, may sometimes have failed to distinguish accurately\r\nbetween objects which are and which are not within its constitutional\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nAfter the most careful examination I find but two examples in the acts\r\nof Congress which furnish any precedent for the present bill, and those\r\nexamples will, in my opinion, serve rather as a warning than as an\r\ninducement to tread in the same path.\r\n\r\nThe first is the act of March 3, 1819, granting a township of land to\r\nthe Connecticut asylum for the education of the deaf and dumb; the\r\nsecond, that of April 5, 1826, making a similar grant of land to the\r\nKentucky asylum for teaching the deaf and dumb--the first more than\r\nthirty years after the adoption of the Constitution and the second more\r\nthan a quarter of a century ago. These acts were unimportant as to the\r\namount appropriated, and so far as I can ascertain were passed on two\r\ngrounds: First, that the object was a charitable one, and, secondly,\r\nthat it was national. To say that it was a charitable object is only\r\nto say that it was an object of expenditure proper for the competent\r\nauthority; but it no more tended to show that it was a proper object of\r\nexpenditure by the United States than is any other purely local object\r\nappealing to the best sympathies of the human heart in any of the\r\nStates. And the suggestion that a school for the mental culture of the\r\ndeaf and dumb in Connecticut or Kentucky is a national object only\r\nshows how loosely this expression has been used when the purpose was\r\nto procure appropriations by Congress. It is not perceived how a school\r\nof this character is otherwise national than is any establishment of\r\nreligious or moral instruction. All the pursuits of industry, everything\r\nwhich promotes the material or intellectual well-being of the race,\r\nevery ear of corn or boll of cotton which grows, is national in the same\r\nsense, for each one of these things goes to swell the aggregate of\r\nnational prosperity and happiness of the United States; but it confounds\r\nall meaning of language to say that these things are \"national,\" as\r\nequivalent to \"Federal,\" so as to come within any of the classes of\r\nappropriation for which Congress is authorized by the Constitution\r\nto legislate.\r\n\r\nIt is a marked point of the history of the Constitution that when it was\r\nproposed to empower Congress to establish a university the proposition\r\nwas confined to the District intended for the future seat of Government\r\nof the United States, and that even that proposed clause was omitted in\r\nconsideration of the exclusive powers conferred on Congress to legislate\r\nfor that District. Could a more decisive indication of the true\r\nconstruction and the spirit of the Constitution in regard to all matters\r\nof this nature have been given? It proves that such objects were\r\nconsidered by the Convention as appertaining to local legislation only;\r\nthat they were not comprehended, either expressly or by implication,\r\nin the grant of general power to Congress, and that consequently they\r\nremained with the several States.\r\n\r\nThe general result at which I have arrived is the necessary consequence\r\nof those views of the relative rights, powers, and duties of the States\r\nand of the Federal Government which I have long entertained and often\r\nexpressed and in reference to which my convictions do but increase in\r\nforce with time and experience.\r\n\r\nI have thus discharged the unwelcome duty of respectfully stating my\r\nobjections to this bill, with which I cheerfully submit the whole\r\nsubject to the wisdom of Congress.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 4, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received the bill entitled \"An act making appropriations for the\r\nrepair, preservation, and completion of certain public works heretofore\r\ncommenced under the authority of law.\" It reaches me in the expiring\r\nhours of the session, and time does not allow full opportunity for\r\nexamining and considering its provisions or of stating at length the\r\nreasons which forbid me to give it my signature.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to that class of measures which are commonly known as\r\ninternal improvements by the General Government, and which from a very\r\nearly period have been deemed of doubtful constitutionality and\r\nexpediency, and have thus failed to obtain the approbation of successive\r\nChief Magistrates.\r\n\r\nOn such an examination of this bill as it has been in my power to make,\r\nI recognize in it certain provisions national in their character, and\r\nwhich, if they stood alone, it would be compatible with my convictions\r\nof public duty to assent to; but at the same time, it embraces others\r\nwhich are merely local, and not, in my judgment, warranted by any safe\r\nor true construction of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTo make proper and sound discriminations between these different\r\nprovisions would require a deliberate discussion of general principles,\r\nas well as a careful scrutiny of details for the purpose of rightfully\r\napplying those principles to each separate item of appropriation.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion with regard to the value and importance of internal\r\nimprovements in the country is undivided. There is a disposition on all\r\nhands to have them prosecuted with energy and to see the benefits sought\r\nto be attained by them fully realized.\r\n\r\nThe prominent point of difference between those who have been regarded\r\nas the friends of a system of internal improvements by the General\r\nGovernment and those adverse to such a system has been one of\r\nconstitutional power, though more or less connected with considerations\r\nof expediency.\r\n\r\nMy own judgment, it is well known, has on both grounds been opposed to\r\n\"a general system of internal improvements\" by the Federal Government. I\r\nhave entertained the most serious doubts from the inherent difficulties\r\nof its application, as well as from past unsatisfactory experience,\r\nwhether the power could be so exercised by the General Government as to\r\nrender its use advantageous either to the country at large or effectual\r\nfor the accomplishment of the object contemplated.\r\n\r\nI shall consider it incumbent on me to present to Congress at its next\r\nsession a matured view of the whole subject, and to endeavor to define,\r\napproximately at least, and according to my own convictions, what\r\nappropriations of this nature by the General Government the great\r\ninterests of the United States require and the Constitution will admit\r\nand sanction, in case no substitute should be devised capable of\r\nreconciling differences both of constitutionality and expediency.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the requisite means and time for duly considering the\r\nwhole subject at present and discussing such possible substitute, it\r\nbecomes necessary to return this bill to the House of Representatives,\r\nin which it originated, and for the reasons thus briefly submitted to\r\nthe consideration of Congress to withhold from it my approval.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following message is inserted here because it is an exposition of\r\nthe reasons of the President for the veto of August 4, 1854, immediately\r\npreceding.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 30, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn returning to the House of Representatives, in which it originated,\r\na bill entitled \"An act making appropriations for the repair,\r\npreservation, and completion of certain public works heretofore\r\ncommenced under the authority of law,\" it became necessary for me, owing\r\nto the late day at which the bill was passed, to state my objections\r\nto it very briefly, announcing at the same time a purpose to resume\r\nthe subject for more deliberate discussion at the present session of\r\nCongress; for, while by no means insensible of the arduousness of the\r\ntask thus undertaken by me, I conceived that the two Houses were\r\nentitled to an exposition of the considerations which had induced\r\ndissent on my part from their conclusions in this instance.\r\n\r\nThe great constitutional question of the power of the General Government\r\nin relation to internal improvements has been the subject of earnest\r\ndifference of opinion at every period of the history of the United\r\nStates. Annual and special messages of successive Presidents have been\r\noccupied with it, sometimes in remarks on the general topic and\r\nfrequently in objection to particular bills. The conflicting sentiments\r\nof eminent statesmen, expressed in Congress or in conventions called\r\nexpressly to devise, if possible, some plan calculated to relieve the\r\nsubject of the embarrassments with which it is environed, while they\r\nhave directed public attention strongly to the magnitude of the\r\ninterests involved, have yet left unsettled the limits, not merely of\r\nexpediency, but of constitutional power, in relation to works of this\r\nclass by the General Government.\r\n\r\nWhat is intended by the phrase \"internal improvements\"? What does it\r\nembrace and what exclude? No such language is found in the Constitution.\r\nNot only is it not an expression of ascertainable constitutional power,\r\nbut it has no sufficient exactness of meaning to be of any value as the\r\nbasis of a safe conclusion either of constitutional law or of practical\r\nstatesmanship.\r\n\r\nPresident John Quincy Adams, in claiming on one occasion, after his\r\nretirement from office, the authorship of the idea of introducing into\r\nthe administration of the affairs of the General Government \"a permanent\r\nand regular system\" of internal improvements, speaks of it as a system\r\nby which \"the whole Union would have been checkered over with railroads\r\nand canals,\" affording \"high wages and constant employment to hundreds\r\nof thousands of laborers;\" and he places it in express contrast with the\r\nconstruction of such works by the legislation of the States and by\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt is quite obvious that if there be any constitutional power which\r\nauthorizes the construction of \"railroads and canals\" by Congress, the\r\nsame power must comprehend turnpikes and ordinary carriage roads; nay, it\r\nmust extend to the construction of bridges, to the draining of marshes,\r\nto the erection of levees, to the construction of canals of irrigation;\r\nin a word, to all the possible means of the material improvement of the\r\nearth, by developing its natural resources anywhere and everywhere, even\r\nwithin the proper jurisdiction of the several States. But if there be\r\nany constitutional power thus comprehensive in its nature, must not the\r\nsame power embrace within its scope other kinds of improvement of equal\r\nutility in themselves and equally important to the welfare of the whole\r\ncountry? President Jefferson, while intimating the expediency of so\r\namending the Constitution as to comprise objects of physical progress\r\nand well-being, does not fail to perceive that \"other objects of public\r\nimprovement,\" including \"public education\" by name, belong to the same\r\nclass of powers. In fact, not only public instruction, but hospitals,\r\nestablishments of science and art, libraries, and, indeed, everything\r\nappertaining to the internal welfare of the country, are just as much\r\nobjects of internal improvement, or, in other words, of internal\r\nutility, as canals and railways.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the power in either of its senses implies its existence\r\nin the other; and since if it exists at all it involves dangerous\r\naugmentation of the political functions and of the patronage of the\r\nFederal Government, we ought to see clearly by what clause or clauses of\r\nthe Constitution it is conferred.\r\n\r\nI have had occasion more than once to express, and deem it proper now\r\nto repeat, that it is, in my judgment, to be taken for granted, as a\r\nfundamental proposition not requiring elucidation, that the Federal\r\nGovernment is the creature of the individual States and of the people\r\nof the States severally; that the sovereign power was in them alone;\r\nthat all the powers of the Federal Government are derivative ones, the\r\nenumeration and limitations of which are contained in the instrument\r\nwhich organized it; and by express terms \"the powers not delegated to\r\nthe United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States\r\nare reserved to the States respectively or to the people.\"\r\n\r\nStarting from this foundation of our constitutional faith and proceeding\r\nto inquire in what part of the Constitution the power of making\r\nappropriations for internal improvements is found, it is necessary to\r\nreject all idea of there being any grant of power in the preamble.\r\nWhen that instrument says, \"We, the people of the United States, in\r\norder to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic\r\ntranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general\r\nwelfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our\r\nposterity,\" it only declares the inducements and the anticipated results\r\nof the things ordained and established by it. To assume that anything\r\nmore can be designed by the language of the preamble would be to\r\nconvert all the body of the Constitution, with its carefully weighed\r\nenumerations and limitations, into mere surplusage. The same may be said\r\nof the phrase in the grant of the power to Congress \"to pay the debts\r\nand provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United\r\nStates;\" or, to construe the words more exactly, they are not\r\nsignificant of grant or concession, but of restriction of the specific\r\ngrants, having the effect of saying that in laying and collecting\r\ntaxes for each of the precise objects of power granted to the General\r\nGovernment Congress must exercise any such definite and undoubted power\r\nin strict subordination to the purpose of the common defense and general\r\nwelfare of all the States.\r\n\r\nThere being no specific grant in the Constitution of a power to sanction\r\nappropriations for internal improvements, and no general provision broad\r\nenough to cover any such indefinite object, it becomes necessary to look\r\nfor particular powers to which one or another of the things included in\r\nthe phrase \"internal improvements\" may be referred.\r\n\r\nIn the discussions of this question by the advocates of the organization\r\nof a \"general system of internal improvements\" under the auspices of the\r\nFederal Government, reliance is had for the justification of the measure\r\non several of the powers expressly granted to Congress, such as to\r\nestablish post-offices and post-roads, to declare war, to provide and\r\nmaintain a navy, to raise and support armies, to regulate commerce, and\r\nto dispose of the territory and other public property of the United\r\nStates,\r\n\r\nAs to the last of these sources of power, that of disposing of the\r\nterritory and other public property of the United States, it may be\r\nconceded that it authorizes Congress, in the management of the public\r\nproperty, to make improvements essential to the successful execution of\r\nthe trust; but this must be the primary object of any such improvement,\r\nand it would be an abuse of the trust to sacrifice the interest of the\r\nproperty to incidental purposes.\r\n\r\nAs to the other assumed sources of a general power over internal\r\nimprovements, they being specific powers of which this is supposed to be\r\nthe incident, if the framers of the Constitution, wise and thoughtful\r\nmen as they were, intended to confer on Congress the power over a\r\nsubject so wide as the whole field of internal improvements, it is\r\nremarkable that they did not use language clearly to express it, or, in\r\nother words, that they did not give it as a distinct and substantive\r\npower instead of making it the implied incident of some other one; for\r\nsuch is the magnitude of the supposed incidental power and its capacity\r\nof expansion that any system established under it would exceed each of\r\nthe others in the amount of expenditure and number of the persons\r\nemployed, which would thus be thrown upon the General Government.\r\n\r\nThis position may be illustrated by taking as a single example one of\r\nthe many things comprehended clearly in the idea of \"a general system of\r\ninternal improvements,\" namely, roads. Let it be supposed that the power\r\nto construct roads over the whole Union, according to the suggestion of\r\nPresident J.Q. Adams in 1807, whilst a member of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, had been conceded. Congress would have begun, in\r\npursuance of the state of knowledge at the time, by constructing\r\nturnpikes; then, as knowledge advanced, it would have constructed\r\ncanals, and at the present time it would have been embarked in an almost\r\nlimitless scheme of railroads.\r\n\r\nNow there are in the United States, the results of State or private\r\nenterprise, upward of 17,000 miles of railroads and 5,000 miles of\r\ncanals; in all, 22,000 miles, the total cost of which may be estimated\r\nat little short of $600,000,000; and if the same works had been\r\nconstructed by the Federal Government, supposing the thing to have\r\nbeen practicable, the cost would have probably been not less than\r\n$900,000,000. The number of persons employed in superintending,\r\nmanaging, and keeping up these canals and railroads may be stated at\r\n126,000 or thereabouts, to which are to be added 70,000 or 80,000\r\nemployed on the railroads in construction, making a total of at least\r\n200,000 persons, representing in families nearly 1,000,000 souls,\r\nemployed on or maintained by this one class of public works in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn view of all this, it is not easy to estimate the disastrous\r\nconsequences which must have resulted from such extended local\r\nimprovements being undertaken by the General Government. State\r\nlegislation upon this subject would have been suspended and private\r\nenterprise paralyzed, while applications for appropriations would have\r\nperverted the legislation of Congress, exhausted the National Treasury,\r\nand left the people burdened with a heavy public debt, beyond the\r\ncapacity of generations to discharge.\r\n\r\nIs it conceivable that the framers of the Constitution intended that\r\nauthority drawing after it such immense consequences should be inferred\r\nby implication as the incident of enumerated powers? I can not think\r\nthis, and the impossibility of supposing it would be still more glaring\r\nif similar calculations were carried out in regard to the numerous\r\nobjects of material, moral, and political usefulness of which the idea\r\nof internal improvement admits. It may be safely inferred that if the\r\nframers of the Constitution had intended to confer the power to make\r\nappropriations for the objects indicated, it would have been enumerated\r\namong the grants expressly made to Congress.. When, therefore, any one\r\nof the powers actually enumerated is adduced or referred to as the\r\nground of an assumption to warrant the incidental or implied power of\r\n\"internal improvement,\" that hypothesis must be rejected, or at least\r\ncan be no further admitted than as the particular act of internal\r\nimprovement may happen to be necessary to the exercise of the granted\r\npower. Thus, when the object of a given road, the clearing of a\r\nparticular channel, or the construction of a particular harbor of refuge\r\nis manifestly required by the exigencies of the naval or military\r\nservice of the country, then it seems to me undeniable that it may be\r\nconstitutionally comprehended in the powers to declare war, to provide\r\nand maintain a navy, and to raise and support armies. At the same time,\r\nit would be a misuse of these powers and a violation of the Constitution\r\nto undertake to build upon them a great system of internal improvements.\r\nAnd similar reasoning applies to the assumption of any such power as\r\nis involved in that to establish post-roads and to regulate commerce.\r\nIf the particular improvement, whether by land or sea, be necessary to\r\nthe execution of the enumerated powers, then, but not otherwise, it\r\nfalls within the jurisdiction of Congress. To this extent only can\r\nthe power be claimed as the incident of any express grant to the\r\nFederal Government.\r\n\r\nBut there is one clause of the Constitution in which it has been\r\nsuggested that express authority to construct works of internal\r\nimprovement has been conferred on Congress, namely, that which empowers\r\nit \"to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such\r\ndistrict (not exceeding 10 miles square) as may by cession of particular\r\nStates and the acceptance of Congress become the seat of the Government\r\nof the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places\r\npurchased by the consent of the legislature of the State in which the\r\nsame shall be for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards,\r\nand _other needful buildings_...\" But any such supposition will be seen\r\nto be groundless when this provision is carefully examined and compared\r\nwith other parts of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that \"like authority\" refers back to \"exclusive\r\nlegislation in all cases whatsoever\" as applied to the District of\r\nColumbia, and there is in the District no division of powers as between\r\nthe General and the State Governments.\r\n\r\nIn those places which the United States has purchased or retains within\r\nany of the States--sites for dockyards or forts, for example--legal\r\nprocess of the given State is still permitted to run for some purposes,\r\nand therefore the jurisdiction of the United States is not absolutely\r\nperfect. But let us assume for the argument's sake that the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States in a tract of land ceded to it for the purpose of a\r\ndockyard or fort by Virginia or Maryland is as complete as in that ceded\r\nby them for the seat of Government, and then proceed to analyze this\r\nclause of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt provides that Congress shall have certain legislative authority over\r\nall places purchased by the United States for certain purposes. It\r\nimplies that Congress has otherwise the power to purchase. But where\r\ndoes Congress get the power to purchase? Manifestly it must be from some\r\nother clause of the Constitution, for it is not conferred by this one.\r\nNow, as it is a fundamental principle that the Constitution is one of\r\nlimited powers, the authority to purchase must be conferred in one of\r\nthe enumerations of legislative power; so that the power to purchase is\r\nitself not an unlimited one, but is limited by the objects in regard to\r\nwhich legislative authority is directly conferred.\r\n\r\nThe other expressions of the clause in question confirm this\r\nconclusion, since the jurisdiction is given as to places purchased\r\nfor certain enumerated objects or purposes. Of these the first great\r\ndivision--forts, magazines, arsenals, and dockyards--is obviously\r\nreferable to recognized heads of specific constitutional power. There\r\nremains only the phrase \"and other _needful_ buildings.\" Wherefore\r\nneedful? Needful for any possible purpose within the whole range of\r\nthe business of society and of Government? Clearly not; but only such\r\n\"buildings\" as are \"needful\" to the United States in the exercise of\r\nany of the powers conferred on Congress.\r\n\r\nThus the United States need, in the exercise of admitted powers, not\r\nonly forts, magazines, arsenals, and dockyards, but also court-houses,\r\nprisons, custom-houses, and post-offices within the respective States.\r\nPlaces for the erection of such buildings the General Government may\r\nconstitutionally purchase, and, having purchased them, the jurisdiction\r\nover them belongs to the United States. So if the General Government has\r\nthe power to build a light-house or a beacon, it may purchase a place\r\nfor that object; and having purchased it, then this clause of the\r\nConstitution gives jurisdiction over it. Still, the power to purchase\r\nfor the purpose of erecting a light-house or beacon must depend on the\r\nexistence of the power to erect, and if that power exists it must be\r\nsought after in some other clause of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point of view, therefore, the subject is regarded, whether\r\nas a question of express or implied power, the conclusion is the same,\r\nthat Congress has no constitutional authority to carry on a system of\r\ninternal improvements; and in this conviction the system has been\r\nsteadily opposed by the soundest expositors of the functions of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that in no conceivable case shall there be\r\ndoubt as to whether a given object be or not a necessary incident\r\nof the military, naval, or any other power. As man is imperfect, so\r\nare his methods of uttering his thoughts. Human language, save in\r\nexpressions for the exact sciences, must always fail to preclude all\r\npossibility of controversy. Hence it is that in one branch of the\r\nsubject--the question of the power of Congress to make appropriations\r\nin aid of navigation--there is less of positive conviction than in\r\nregard to the general subject; and it therefore seems proper in this\r\nrespect to revert to the history of the practice of the Government.\r\n\r\nAmong the very earliest acts of the first session of Congress was that\r\nfor the establishment and support of light-houses, approved by President\r\nWashington on the 7th of August, 1789, which contains the following\r\nprovisions:\r\n\r\n\r\n  That all expenses which shall accrue from and after the 15th day of\r\n  August, 1789, in the necessary support, maintenance, and repairs of\r\n  all light-houses, beacons, buoys, and public piers erected, placed, or\r\n  sunk before the passing of this act at the entrance of or within any\r\n  bay, inlet, harbor, or port of the United States, for rendering the\r\n  navigation thereof easy and safe, shall be defrayed out of the Treasury\r\n  of the United States: _Provided, nevertheless_, That none of the said\r\n  expenses shall continue to be so defrayed after the expiration of one\r\n  year from the day aforesaid unless such light-houses, beacons, buoys,\r\n  and public piers shall in the meantime be ceded to and vested in the\r\n  United States by the State or States, respectively, in which the same\r\n  may be, together with the lands and tenements thereunto belonging and\r\n  together with the jurisdiction of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nActs containing appropriations for this class of public works were\r\npassed in 1791, 1792, 1793, and so on from year to year down to the\r\npresent time; and the tenor of these acts, when examined with reference\r\nto other parts of the subject, is worthy of special consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that for a period of more than thirty years\r\nafter the adoption of the Constitution all appropriations of this class\r\nwere confined, with scarcely an apparent exception, to the construction\r\nof light-houses, beacons, buoys, and public piers and the stakage of\r\nchannels; to render navigation \"safe and easy,\" it is true, but only\r\nby indicating to the navigator obstacles in his way, not by removing\r\nthose obstacles nor in any other respect changing, artificially, the\r\npreexisting natural condition of the earth and sea. It is obvious,\r\nhowever, that works of art for the removal of natural impediments to\r\nnavigation, or to prevent their formation, or for supplying harbors\r\nwhere these do not exist, are also means of rendering navigation safe\r\nand easy, and may in supposable cases be the most efficient, as well as\r\nthe most economical, of such means. Nevertheless, it is not until the\r\nyear 1824 that in an act to improve the navigation of the rivers Ohio\r\nand Mississippi and in another act making appropriations for deepening\r\nthe channel leading into the harbor of Presque Isle, on Lake Erie, and\r\nfor repairing Plymouth Beach, in Massachusetts Bay, we have any example\r\nof an appropriation for the improvement of harbors in the nature of\r\nthose provided for in the bill returned by me to the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nIt appears not probable that the abstinence of Congress in this respect\r\nis attributable altogether to considerations of economy or to any\r\nfailure to perceive that the removal of an obstacle to navigation might\r\nbe not less useful than the indication of it for avoidance, and it may\r\nbe well assumed that the course of legislation so long pursued was\r\ninduced, in whole or in part, by solicitous consideration in regard to\r\nthe constitutional power over such matters vested in Congress.\r\n\r\nOne other peculiarity in this course of legislation is not less\r\nremarkable. It is that when the General Government first took charge of\r\nlighthouses and beacons it required the works themselves and the lands\r\non which they were situated to be ceded to the United States. And\r\nalthough for a time this precaution was neglected in the case of new\r\nworks, in the sequel it was provided by general laws that no light-house\r\nshould be constructed on any site previous to the jurisdiction over the\r\nsame being ceded to the United States.\r\n\r\nConstitutional authority for the construction and support of many of the\r\npublic works of this nature, it is certain, may be found in the power\r\nof Congress to maintain a navy and provide for the general defense; but\r\ntheir number, and in many instances their location, preclude the idea of\r\ntheir being fully justified as necessary and proper incidents of that\r\npower. And they do not seem susceptible of being referred to any other\r\nof the specific powers vested in Congress by the Constitution, unless it\r\nbe that to raise revenue in so far as this relates to navigation. The\r\npractice under all my predecessors in office, the express admissions of\r\nsome of them, and absence of denial by any sufficiently manifest their\r\nbelief that the power to erect light-houses, beacons, and piers is\r\npossessed by the General Government. In the acts of Congress, as we\r\nhave already seen, the inducement and object of the appropriations\r\nare expressly declared, those appropriations being for \"light-houses,\r\nbeacons, buoys, and public piers\" erected or placed \"within any bay,\r\ninlet, harbor, or port of the United States for rendering the navigation\r\nthereof easy and safe.\"\r\n\r\nIf it be contended that this review of the history of appropriations\r\nof this class leads to the inference that, beyond the purposes of\r\nnational defense and maintenance of a navy, there is authority in the\r\nConstitution to construct certain works in aid of navigation, it is\r\nat the same time to be remembered that the conclusions thus deduced\r\nfrom cotemporaneous construction and long-continued acquiescence are\r\nthemselves directly suggestive of limitations of constitutionality, as\r\nwell as expediency, regarding the nature and the description of those\r\naids to navigation which Congress may provide as incident to the revenue\r\npower; for at this point controversy begins, not so much as to the\r\nprinciple as to its application.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with long-established legislative usage, Congress may\r\nconstruct light-houses and beacons and provide, as it does, other means\r\nto prevent shipwrecks on the coasts of the United States. But the\r\nGeneral Government can not go beyond this and make improvements of\r\nrivers and harbors of the nature and to the degree of all the provisions\r\nof the bill of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nTo justify such extended power, it has been urged that if it be\r\nconstitutional to appropriate money for the purpose of pointing out,\r\nby the construction of light-houses or beacons, where an obstacle to\r\nnavigation exists, it is equally so to remove such obstacle or to avoid\r\nit by the creation of an artificial channel; that if the object be\r\nlawful, then the means adopted solely with reference to the end must\r\nbe lawful, and that therefore it is not material, constitutionally\r\nspeaking, whether a given obstruction to navigation be indicated for\r\navoidance or be actually avoided by excavating a new channel; that if\r\nit be a legitimate object of expenditure to preserve a ship from wreck\r\nby means of a beacon or of revenue cutters, it must be not less so\r\nto provide places of safety by the improvement of harbors, or, where\r\nnone exist, by their artificial construction; and thence the argument\r\nnaturally passes to the propriety of improving rivers for the benefit\r\nof internal navigation, because all these objects are of more or less\r\nimportance to the commercial as well as the naval interests of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe answer to all this is that the question of opening speedy and easy\r\ncommunication to and through all parts of the country is substantially\r\nthe same, whether done by land or water; that the uses of roads and\r\ncanals in facilitating commercial intercourse and uniting by community\r\nof interests the most remote quarters of the country by land\r\ncommunication are the same in their nature as the uses of navigable\r\nwaters; and that therefore the question of the facilities and aids to\r\nbe provided to navigation, by whatsoever means, is but a subdivision of\r\nthe great question of the constitutionality and expediency of internal\r\nimprovements by the General Government. In confirmation of this it is to\r\nbe remarked that one of the most important acts of appropriation of this\r\nclass, that of the year 1833, under the Administration of President\r\nJackson, by including together and providing for in one bill as well\r\nriver and harbor works as road works, impliedly recognizes the fact that\r\nthey are alike branches of the same great subject of internal\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nAs the population, territory, and wealth of the country increased and\r\nsettlements extended into remote regions, the necessity for additional\r\nmeans of communication impressed itself upon all minds with a force\r\nwhich had not been experienced at the date of the formation of the\r\nConstitution, and more and more embarrassed those who were most anxious\r\nto abstain scrupulously from any exercise of doubtful power. Hence the\r\nrecognition in the messages of Presidents Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe\r\nof the eminent desirableness of such works, with admission that some of\r\nthem could lawfully and should be conducted by the General Government,\r\nbut with obvious uncertainty of opinion as to the line between such\r\nas are constitutional and such as are not, such as ought to receive\r\nappropriations from Congress and such as ought to be consigned to\r\nprivate enterprise or the legislation of the several States.\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty has not been removed by the practical working of our\r\ninstitutions in later times; for although the acquisition of additional\r\nterritory and the application of steam to the propulsion of vessels have\r\ngreatly magnified the importance of internal commerce, this fact has at\r\nthe same time complicated the question of the power of the General\r\nGovernment over the present subject.\r\n\r\nIn fine, a careful review of the opinions of all my predecessors and of\r\nthe legislative history of the country does not indicate any fixed rule\r\nby which to decide what, of the infinite variety of possible river and\r\nharbor improvements, are within the scope of the power delegated by\r\nthe Constitution; and the question still remains unsettled. President\r\nJackson conceded the constitutionality, under suitable circumstances, of\r\nthe improvement of rivers and harbors through the agency of Congress,\r\nand President Polk admitted the propriety of the establishment and\r\nsupport by appropriations from the Treasury of light-houses, beacons,\r\nbuoys, and other improvements within the bays, inlets, and harbors of\r\nthe ocean and lake coasts immediately connected with foreign commerce.\r\n\r\nBut if the distinction thus made rests upon the differences between\r\nforeign and domestic commerce it can not be restricted thereby to the\r\nbays, inlets, and harbors of the oceans and lakes, because foreign\r\ncommerce has already penetrated thousands of miles into the interior\r\nof the continent by means of our great rivers, and will continue so to\r\nextend itself with the progress of settlement until it reaches the limit\r\nof navigability.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the Constitution the vast Valley of the\r\nMississippi, now teeming with population and supplying almost boundless\r\nresources, was literally an unexplored wilderness. Our advancement has\r\noutstripped even the most sanguine anticipations of the fathers of\r\nthe Republic, and it illustrates the fact that no rule is admissible\r\nwhich undertakes to discriminate, so far as regards river and harbor\r\nimprovements, between the Atlantic or Pacific coasts and the great lakes\r\nand rivers of the interior regions of North America. Indeed, it is quite\r\nerroneous to suppose that any such discrimination has ever existed\r\nin the practice of the Government. To the contrary of which is the\r\nsignificant fact, before stated, that when, after abstaining from all\r\nsuch appropriations for more than thirty years, Congress entered upon\r\nthe policy of improving the navigation of rivers and harbors, it\r\ncommenced with the rivers Mississippi and Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the Union, adopting in this respect one of the ideas of\r\nthat of the Confederation, has taken heed to declare from time to time,\r\nas occasion required, either in acts for disposing of the public lands\r\nin the Territories or in acts for admitting new States, that all\r\nnavigable rivers within the same \"shall be deemed to be and remain\r\npublic highways.\"\r\n\r\nOut of this condition of things arose a question which at successive\r\nperiods of our public annals has occupied the attention of the best\r\nminds in the Union. This question is, What waters are public navigable\r\nwaters, so as not to be of State character and jurisdiction, but of\r\nFederal jurisdiction and character, in the intent of the Constitution\r\nand of Congress? A proximate, but imperfect, answer to this important\r\nquestion is furnished by the acts of Congress and the decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States defining the constitutional limits of\r\nthe maritime jurisdiction of the General Government. That jurisdiction\r\nis entirely independent of the revenue power. It is not derived from\r\nthat, nor is it measured thereby.\r\n\r\nIn that act of Congress which, in the first year of the Government,\r\norganized our judicial system, and which, whether we look to the\r\nsubject, the comprehensive wisdom with which it was treated, or the\r\ndeference with which its provisions have come to be regarded, is only\r\nsecond to the Constitution itself, there is a section in which the\r\nstatesmen who framed the Constitution have placed on record their\r\nconstruction of it in this matter. It enacts that the district courts of\r\nthe United States \"shall have exclusive cognizance of all civil cases\r\nof admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including all seizures under\r\nthe law of impost, navigation, or trade of the United States, when the\r\nseizures are made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels\r\nof 10 or more tons burden, within their respective districts, as well\r\nas upon the high seas.\" In this cotemporaneous exposition of the\r\nConstitution there is no trace or suggestion that nationality of\r\njurisdiction is limited to the sea, or even to tide waters. The law is\r\nmarked by a sagacious apprehension of the fact that the Great Lakes\r\nand the Mississippi were navigable waters of the United States even\r\nthen, before the acquisition of Louisiana had made wholly our own the\r\nterritorial greatness of the West. It repudiates unequivocally the rule\r\nof the common law, according to which the question of whether a water\r\nis public navigable water or not depends on whether it is salt or not,\r\nand therefore, in a river, confines that quality to tide water--a rule\r\nresulting from the geographical condition of England and applicable to\r\nan island, with small and narrow streams, the only navigable portion of\r\nwhich, for ships, is in immediate contact with the ocean, but wholly\r\ninapplicable to the great inland fresh-water seas of America and its\r\nmighty rivers, with secondary branches exceeding in magnitude the\r\nlargest rivers of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAt a later period it is true that, in disregard of the more\r\ncomprehensive definition of navigability afforded by that act of\r\nCongress, it was for a time held by many that the rule established for\r\nEngland was to be received in the United States, the effect of which was\r\nto exclude from the jurisdiction of the General Government not only the\r\nwaters of the Mississippi, but also those of the Great Lakes. To this\r\nconstruction it was with truth objected that, in so far as concerns the\r\nlakes, they are in fact seas, although of freshwater; that they are the\r\nnatural marine communications between a series of populous States and\r\nbetween them and the possessions of a foreign nation; that they are\r\nactually navigated by ships of commerce of the largest capacity; that\r\nthey had once been and might again be the scene of foreign war; and that\r\ntherefore it was doing violence to all reason to undertake by means of\r\nan arbitrary doctrine of technical foreign law to exclude such waters\r\nfrom the jurisdiction of the General Government. In regard to the river\r\nMississippi, it was objected that to draw a line across that river at\r\nthe point of ebb and flood of tide, and say that the part below was\r\npublic navigable water and the part above not, while in the latter the\r\nwater was at least equally deep and navigable and its commerce as rich\r\nas in the former, with numerous ports of foreign entry and delivery, was\r\nto sanction a distinction artificial and unjust, because regardless of\r\nthe real fact of navigability.\r\n\r\nWe may conceive that some such considerations led to the enactment in\r\nthe year 1845 of an act in addition to that of 1789, declaring that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The district courts of the United States shall have, possess, and\r\n  exercise the same jurisdiction in matters of contract and tort arising\r\n  in, upon, or concerning steamboats and other vessels of 20 tons burden\r\n  and upward, enrolled and licensed for the coasting trade and at the time\r\n  employed in business of commerce and navigation between ports and places\r\n  in different States and Territories upon the lakes and navigable waters\r\n  connecting said lakes, as is now possessed and exercised by the said\r\n  courts in cases of the like steamboats and other vessels employed in\r\n  navigation and commerce upon the high seas or tide waters within the\r\n  admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is observable that the act of 1789 applies the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States to all \"waters which are navigable from the sea\" for\r\nvessels of 10 tons burden, and that of 1845 extends the jurisdiction to\r\nenrolled vessels of 20 tons burden, on the lakes and navigable waters\r\nconnecting said lakes, though not waters navigable from the sea,\r\nprovided such vessels be employed between places in different States and\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that these provisions of law in effect prescribe\r\nconditions by which to determine whether any waters are public navigable\r\nwaters, subject to the authority of the Federal Government. The\r\nconditions include all waters, whether salt or fresh, and whether of\r\nsea, lake, or river, provided they be capable of navigation by vessels\r\nof a certain tonnage, and for commerce either between the United States\r\nand foreign countries or between any two or more of the States or\r\nTerritories of the Union. This excludes water wholly within any\r\nparticular State, and not used as the means of commercial communication\r\nwith any other State, and subject to be improved or obstructed at will\r\nby the State within which it may happen to be.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of these provisions of statute has been called\r\nin question. Their constitutionality has been maintained, however,\r\nby repeated decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, and\r\nthey are therefore the law of the land by the concurrent act of the\r\nlegislative, the executive, and the judicial departments of the\r\nGovernment. Regarded as affording a criterion of what is navigable\r\nwater, and as such subject to the maritime jurisdiction of the Supreme\r\nCourt and of Congress, these acts are objectionable in this, that the\r\nrule of navigability is an arbitrary one, that Congress may repeal\r\nthe present rule and adopt a new one, and that thus a legislative\r\ndefinition will be able to restrict or enlarge the limits of\r\nconstitutional power. Yet this variableness of standard seems inherent\r\nin the nature of things. At any rate, neither the First Congress,\r\ncomposed of the statesmen of the era when the Constitution was adopted,\r\nnor any subsequent Congress has afforded us the means of attaining\r\ngreater precision of construction as to this part of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis reflection may serve to relieve from undeserved reproach an\r\nidea of one of the greatest men of the Republic--President Jackson.\r\nHe, seeking amid all the difficulties of the subject for some practical\r\nrule of action in regard to appropriations for the improvement of rivers\r\nand harbors, prescribed for his own official conduct the rule of\r\nconfining such appropriations to \"places below the ports of entry or\r\ndelivery established by law.\" He saw clearly, as the authors of the\r\nabove-mentioned acts of 1789 and 1845 did, that there is no inflexible\r\nnatural line of discrimination between what is national and what local\r\nby means of which to determine absolutely and unerringly at what point\r\non a river the jurisdiction of the United States shall end. He\r\nperceived, and of course admitted, that the Constitution, while\r\nconferring on the General Government some power of action to render\r\nnavigation safe and easy, had of necessity left to Congress much of\r\ndiscretion in this matter. He confided in the patriotism of Congress to\r\nexercise that discretion wisely, not permitting himself to suppose it\r\npossible that a port of entry or delivery would ever be established by\r\nlaw for the express and only purpose of evading the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt remains, therefore, to consider the question of the measure of\r\ndiscretion in the exercise by Congress of the power to provide for the\r\nimprovement of rivers and harbors, and also that of the legitimate\r\nresponsibility of the Executive in the same relation.\r\n\r\nIn matters of legislation of the most unquestionable constitutionality\r\nit is always material to consider what amount of public money shall be\r\nappropriated for any particular object. The same consideration applies\r\nwith augmented force to a class of appropriations which are in their\r\nnature peculiarly prone to run to excess, and which, being made in the\r\nexercise of incidental powers, have intrinsic tendency to overstep the\r\nbounds of constitutionality.\r\n\r\nIf an appropriation for improving the navigability of a river or\r\ndeepening or protecting a harbor have reference to military or naval\r\npurposes, then its rightfulness, whether in amount or in the objects\r\nto which it is applied, depends, manifestly, on the military or naval\r\nexigency; and the subject-matter affords its own measure of legislative\r\ndiscretion. But if the appropriation for such an object have no distinct\r\nrelation to the military or naval wants of the country, and is wholly,\r\nor even mainly, intended to promote the revenue from commerce, then the\r\nvery vagueness of the proposed purpose of the expenditure constitutes\r\na perpetual admonition of reserve and caution. Through disregard of\r\nthis it is undeniable that in many cases appropriations of this nature\r\nhave been made unwisely, without accomplishing beneficial results\r\ncommensurate with the cost, and sometimes for evil rather than good,\r\nindependently of their dubious relation to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAmong the radical changes of the course of legislation in these matters\r\nwhich, in my judgment, the public interest demands, one is a return to\r\nthe primitive idea of Congress, which required in this class of public\r\nworks, as in all others, a conveyance of the soil and a cession of the\r\njurisdiction to the United States. I think this condition ought never to\r\nhave been waived in the case of any harbor improvement of a permanent\r\nnature, as where piers, jetties, sea walls, and other like works are to\r\nbe constructed and maintained. It would powerfully tend to counteract\r\nendeavors to obtain appropriations of a local character and chiefly\r\ncalculated to promote individual interests. The want of such a provision\r\nis the occasion of abuses in regard to existing works, exposing them to\r\nprivate encroachment without sufficient means of redress by law. Indeed,\r\nthe absence in such cases of a cession of jurisdiction has constituted\r\none of the constitutional objections to appropriations of this class.\r\nIt is not easy to perceive any sufficient reason for requiring it in\r\nthe case of arsenals or forts which does not equally apply to all other\r\npublic works. If to be constructed and maintained by Congress in the\r\nexercise of a constitutional power of appropriation, they should be\r\nbrought within the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is another measure of precaution in regard to such appropriations\r\nwhich seems to me to be worthy of the consideration of Congress. It is\r\nto make appropriation for every work in a separate bill, so that each\r\none shall stand on its own independent merits, and if it pass shall\r\ndo so under circumstances of legislative scrutiny entitling it to be\r\nregarded as of general interest and a proper subject of charge on the\r\nTreasury of the Union.\r\n\r\nDuring that period of time in which the country had not come to look to\r\nCongress for appropriations of this nature several of the States whose\r\nproductions or geographical position invited foreign commerce had\r\nentered upon plans for the improvement of their harbors by themselves\r\nand through means of support drawn directly from that commerce, in\r\nvirtue of an express constitutional power, needing for its exercise\r\nonly the permission of Congress. Harbor improvements thus constructed\r\nand maintained, the expenditures upon them being defrayed by the very\r\nfacilities they afford, are a voluntary charge on those only who see fit\r\nto avail themselves of such facilities, and can be justly complained of\r\nby none. On the other hand, so long as these improvements are carried on\r\nby appropriations from the Treasury the benefits will continue to inure\r\nto those alone who enjoy the facilities afforded, while the expenditure\r\nwill be a burden upon the whole country and the discrimination a double\r\ninjury to places equally requiring improvement, but not equally favored\r\nby appropriations.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, added to the embarrassments of the whole question,\r\namply suffice to suggest the policy of confining appropriations by the\r\nGeneral Government to works necessary to the execution of its undoubted\r\npowers and of leaving all others to individual enterprise or to the\r\nseparate States, to be provided for out of their own resources or by\r\nrecurrence to the provision of the Constitution which authorizes the\r\nStates to lay duties of tonnage with the consent of Congress.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been received by me that an unlawful expedition\r\nhas been fitted out in the State of California with a view to invade\r\nMexico, a nation maintaining friendly relations with the United States,\r\nand that other expeditions are organizing within the United States for\r\nthe same unlawful purpose; and\r\n\r\nWhereas certain citizens and inhabitants of this country, unmindful\r\nof their obligations and duties and of the rights of a friendly power,\r\nhave participated and are about to participate in these enterprises,\r\nso derogatory to our national character and so threatening to our\r\ntranquillity, and are thereby incurring the severe penalties imposed\r\nby law against such offenders:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Franklin Pierce, President of the United States,\r\nhave issued this my proclamation, warning all persons who shall connect\r\nthemselves with any such enterprise or expedition that the penalties\r\nof the law denounced against such criminal conduct will be rigidly\r\nenforced; and I exhort all good citizens, as they regard our national\r\ncharacter, as they respect our laws or the law of nations, as they\r\nvalue the blessings of peace and the welfare of their country,\r\nto discountenance and by all lawful means prevent such criminal\r\nenterprises; and I call upon all officers of this Government, civil\r\nand military, to use any efforts which may be in their power to arrest\r\nfor trial and punishment every such offender.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthis 18th day of January, A.D. 1854, and the seventy-eighth of the\r\nIndependence of the United States.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W.L.

MARCY,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 4_, _1854_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe past has been an eventful year, and will be hereafter referred to as\r\na marked epoch in the history of the world. While we have been happily\r\npreserved from the calamities of war, our domestic prosperity has not\r\nbeen entirely uninterrupted. The crops in portions of the country have\r\nbeen nearly cut off. Disease has prevailed to a greater extent than\r\nusual, and the sacrifice of human life through casualties by sea and\r\nland is without parallel. But the pestilence has swept by, and restored\r\nsalubrity invites the absent to their homes and the return of business\r\nto its ordinary channels. If the earth has rewarded the labor of the\r\nhusbandman less bountifully than in preceding seasons, it has left him\r\nwith abundance for domestic wants and a large surplus for exportation.\r\nIn the present, therefore, as in the past, we find ample grounds for\r\nreverent thankfulness to the God of grace and providence for His\r\nprotecting care and merciful dealings with us as a people.\r\n\r\nAlthough our attention has been arrested by painful interest in passing\r\nevents, yet our country feels no more than the slight vibrations of the\r\nconvulsions which have shaken Europe. As individuals we can not repress\r\nsympathy with human suffering nor regret for the causes which produce\r\nit; as a nation we are reminded that whatever interrupts the peace or\r\nchecks the prosperity of any part of Christendom tends more or less\r\nto involve our own. The condition of States is not unlike that of\r\nindividuals; they are mutually dependent upon each other. Amicable\r\nrelations between them and reciprocal good will are essential for the\r\npromotion of whatever is desirable in their moral, social, and political\r\ncondition. Hence it has been my earnest endeavor to maintain peace and\r\nfriendly intercourse with all nations.\r\n\r\nThe wise theory of this Government, so early adopted and steadily\r\npursued, of avoiding all entangling alliances has hitherto exempted\r\nit from many complications in which it would otherwise have become\r\ninvolved. Notwithstanding this our clearly defined and well-sustained\r\ncourse of action and our geographical position, so remote from Europe,\r\nincreasing disposition has been manifested by some of its Governments to\r\nsupervise and in certain respects to direct our foreign policy. In plans\r\nfor adjusting the balance of power among themselves they have assumed to\r\ntake us into account, and would constrain us to conform our conduct to\r\ntheir views. One or another of the powers of Europe has from time to\r\ntime undertaken to enforce arbitrary regulations contrary in many\r\nrespects to established principles of international law. That law the\r\nUnited States have in their foreign intercourse uniformly respected and\r\nobserved, and they can not recognize any such interpolations therein as\r\nthe temporary interests of others may suggest. They do not admit that\r\nthe sovereigns of one continent or of a particular community of states\r\ncan legislate for all others.\r\n\r\nLeaving the transatlantic nations to adjust their political system in\r\nthe way they may think best for their common welfare, the independent\r\npowers of this continent may well assert the right to be exempt from all\r\nannoying interference on their part. Systematic abstinence from intimate\r\npolitical connection with distant foreign nations does not conflict with\r\ngiving the widest range to our foreign commerce. This distinction, so\r\nclearly marked in history, seems to have been overlooked or disregarded\r\nby some leading foreign states. Our refusal to be brought within and\r\nsubjected to their peculiar system has, I fear, created a jealous\r\ndistrust of our conduct and induced on their part occasional acts of\r\ndisturbing effect upon our foreign relations. Our present attitude and\r\npast course give assurances, which should not be questioned, that our\r\npurposes are not aggressive nor threatening to the safety and welfare of\r\nother nations. Our military establishment in time of peace is adapted to\r\nmaintain exterior defenses and to preserve order among the aboriginal\r\ntribes within the limits of the Union. Our naval force is intended only\r\nfor the protection of our citizens abroad and of our commerce, diffused,\r\nas it is, over all the seas of the globe. The Government of the United\r\nStates, being essentially pacific in policy, stands prepared to repel\r\ninvasion by the voluntary service of a patriotic people, and provides no\r\npermanent means of foreign aggression. These considerations should allay\r\nall apprehension that we are disposed to encroach on the rights or\r\nendanger the security of other states.\r\n\r\nSome European powers have regarded with disquieting concern the\r\nterritorial expansion of the United States. This rapid growth has\r\nresulted from the legitimate exercise of sovereign rights belonging\r\nalike to all nations, and by many liberally exercised. Under such\r\ncircumstances it could hardly have been expected that those among them\r\nwhich have within a comparatively recent period subdued and absorbed\r\nancient kingdoms, planted their standards on every continent, and now\r\npossess or claim the control of the islands of every ocean as their\r\nappropriate domain would look with unfriendly sentiments upon the\r\nacquisitions of this country, in every instance honorably obtained, or\r\nwould feel themselves justified in imputing our advancement to a spirit\r\nof aggression or to a passion for political predominance.\r\n\r\nOur foreign commerce has reached a magnitude and extent nearly equal to\r\nthat of the first maritime power of the earth, and exceeding that of any\r\nother. Over this great interest, in which not only our merchants, but\r\nall classes of citizens, at least indirectly, are concerned, it is\r\nthe duty of the executive and legislative branches of the Government\r\nto exercise a careful supervision and adopt proper measures for its\r\nprotection. The policy which I had in view in regard to this interest\r\nembraces its future as well as its present security. Long experience has\r\nshown that, in general, when the principal powers of Europe are engaged\r\nin war the rights of neutral nations are endangered. This consideration\r\nled, in the progress of the War of our Independence, to the formation of\r\nthe celebrated confederacy of armed neutrality, a primary object of\r\nwhich was to assert the doctrine that free ships make free goods, except\r\nin the case of articles contraband of war--a doctrine which from the\r\nvery commencement of our national being has been a cherished idea of the\r\nstatesmen of this country. At one period or another every maritime power\r\nhas by some solemn treaty stipulation recognized that principle, and it\r\nmight have been hoped that it would come to be universally received and\r\nrespected as a rule of international law. But the refusal of one power\r\nprevented this, and in the next great war which ensued--that of the\r\nFrench Revolution--it failed to be respected among the belligerent\r\nStates of Europe. Notwithstanding this, the principle is generally\r\nadmitted to be a sound and salutary one, so much so that at the\r\ncommencement of the existing war in Europe Great Britain and France\r\nannounced their purpose to observe it for the present; not, however, as\r\na recognized international right, but as a mere concession for the time\r\nbeing. The cooperation, however, of these two powerful maritime nations\r\nin the interest of neutral rights appeared to me to afford an occasion\r\ninviting and justifying on the part of the United States a renewed\r\neffort to make the doctrine in question a principle of international\r\nlaw, by means of special conventions between the several powers of\r\nEurope and America. Accordingly, a proposition embracing not only the\r\nrule that free ships make free goods, except contraband articles, but\r\nalso the less contested one that neutral property other than contraband,\r\nthough on board enemy's ships, shall be exempt from confiscation, has\r\nbeen submitted by this Government to those of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nRussia acted promptly in this matter, and a convention was concluded\r\nbetween that country and the United States providing for the observance\r\nof the principles announced, not only as between themselves, but also\r\nas between them and all other nations which shall enter into like\r\nstipulations. None of the other powers have as yet taken final action on\r\nthe subject. I am not aware, however, that any objection to the proposed\r\nstipulations has been made, but, on the contrary, they are acknowledged\r\nto be essential to the security of neutral commerce, and the only\r\napparent obstacle to their general adoption is in the possibility that\r\nit may be encumbered by inadmissible conditions.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Two Sicilies has expressed to our minister at Naples his\r\nreadiness to concur in our proposition relative to neutral rights and to\r\nenter into a convention on that subject.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia entirely approves of the project of a treaty to\r\nthe same effect submitted to him, but proposes an additional article\r\nproviding for the renunciation of privateering. Such an article,\r\nfor most obvious reasons, is much desired by nations having naval\r\nestablishments large in proportion to their foreign commerce. If it\r\nwere adopted as an international rule, the commerce of a nation having\r\ncomparatively a small naval force would be very much at the mercy of its\r\nenemy in case of war with a power of decided naval superiority. The bare\r\nstatement of the condition in which the United States would be placed,\r\nafter having surrendered the right to resort to privateers, in the\r\nevent of war with a belligerent of naval supremacy will show that this\r\nGovernment could never listen to such a proposition. The navy of the\r\nfirst maritime power in Europe is at least ten times as large as that of\r\nthe United States. The foreign commerce of the two countries is nearly\r\nequal, and about equally exposed to hostile depredations. In war between\r\nthat power and the United States, without resort on our part to our\r\nmercantile marine the means of our enemy to inflict injury upon our\r\ncommerce would be tenfold greater than ours to retaliate. We could not\r\nextricate our country from this unequal condition, with such an enemy,\r\nunless we at once departed from our present peaceful policy and became a\r\ngreat naval power. Nor would this country be better situated in war with\r\none of the secondary naval powers. Though the naval disparity would be\r\nless, the greater extent and more exposed condition of our widespread\r\ncommerce would give any of them a like advantage over us.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to enter into engagements to forego a resort to\r\nprivateers in case this country should be forced into war with a great\r\nnaval power is not entitled to more favorable consideration than would\r\nbe a proposition to agree not to accept the services of volunteers for\r\noperations on land. When the honor or the rights of our country require\r\nit to assume a hostile attitude, it confidently relies upon the\r\npatriotism of its citizens, not ordinarily devoted to the military\r\nprofession, to augment the Army and the Navy so as to make them fully\r\nadequate to the emergency which calls them into action. The proposal to\r\nsurrender the right to employ privateers is professedly founded upon the\r\nprinciple that private property of unoffending noncombatants, though\r\nenemies, should be exempt from the ravages of war; but the proposed\r\nsurrender goes but little way in carrying out that principle, which\r\nequally requires that such private property should not be seized or\r\nmolested by national ships of war. Should the leading powers of Europe\r\nconcur in proposing as a rule of international law to exempt private\r\nproperty upon the ocean from seizure by public armed cruisers as well\r\nas by privateers, the United States will readily meet them upon that\r\nbroad ground.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain relative to coast fisheries\r\nand to reciprocal trade with the British North American Provinces have\r\nbeen exchanged, and some of its anticipated advantages are already\r\nenjoyed by us, although its full execution was to abide certain acts of\r\nlegislation not yet fully performed. So soon as it was ratified Great\r\nBritain opened to our commerce the free navigation of the river St.\r\nLawrence and to our fishermen unmolested access to the shores and bays,\r\nfrom which they had been previously excluded, on the coasts of her North\r\nAmerican Provinces; in return for which she asked for the introduction\r\nfree of duty into the ports of the United States of the fish caught\r\non the same coast by British fishermen. This being the compensation\r\nstipulated in the treaty for privileges of the highest importance and\r\nvalue to the United States, which were thus voluntarily yielded before\r\nit became effective, the request seemed to me to be a reasonable one;\r\nbut it could not be acceded to from want of authority to suspend our\r\nlaws imposing duties upon all foreign fish. In the meantime the Treasury\r\nDepartment issued a regulation for ascertaining the duties paid or\r\nsecured by bonds on fish caught on the coasts of the British Provinces\r\nand brought to our markets by British subjects after the fishing grounds\r\nhad been made fully accessible to the citizens of the United States.\r\nI recommend to your favorable consideration a proposition, which will\r\nbe submitted to you, for authority to refund the duties and cancel the\r\nbonds thus received. The Provinces of Canada and New Brunswick have\r\nalso anticipated the full operation of the treaty by legislative\r\narrangements, respectively, to admit free of duty the products of\r\nthe United States mentioned in the free list of the treaty; and an\r\narrangement similar to that regarding British fish has been made for\r\nduties now chargeable on the products of those Provinces enumerated in\r\nthe same free list and introduced therefrom into the United States, a\r\nproposition for refunding which will, in my judgment, be in like manner\r\nentitled to your favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is difference of opinion between the United States and Great\r\nBritain as to the boundary line of the Territory of Washington adjoining\r\nthe British possessions on the Pacific, which has already led to\r\ndifficulties on the part of the citizens and local authorities of the\r\ntwo Governments. I recommend that provision be made for a commission,\r\nto be joined by one on the part of Her Britannic Majesty, for the\r\npurpose of running and establishing the line in controversy. Certain\r\nstipulations of the third and fourth articles of the treaty concluded by\r\nthe United States and Great Britain in 1846, regarding possessory rights\r\nof the Hudsons Bay Company and property of the Pugets Sound Agricultural\r\nCompany, have given rise to serious disputes, and it is important to\r\nall concerned that summary means of settling them amicably should be\r\ndevised. I have reason to believe that an arrangement can be made on\r\njust terms for the extinguishment of the rights in question, embracing\r\nalso the right of the Hudsons Bay Company to the navigation of the river\r\nColumbia; and I therefore suggest to your consideration the expediency\r\nof making a contingent appropriation for that purpose.\r\n\r\nFrance was the early and efficient ally of the United States in\r\ntheir struggle for independence. From that time to the present, with\r\noccasional slight interruptions, cordial relations of friendship have\r\nexisted between the Governments and people of the two countries. The\r\nkindly sentiments cherished alike by both nations have led to extensive\r\nsocial and commercial intercourse, which I trust will not be interrupted\r\nor checked by any casual event of an apparently unsatisfactory\r\ncharacter. The French consul at San Francisco was not long since brought\r\ninto the United States district court at that place by compulsory\r\nprocess as a witness in favor of another foreign consul, in violation,\r\nas the French Government conceives, of his privileges under our consular\r\nconvention with France. There being nothing in the transaction which\r\ncould imply any disrespect to France or its consul, such explanation\r\nhas been made as, I hope, will be satisfactory. Subsequently\r\nmisunderstanding arose on the subject of the French Government having,\r\nas it appeared, abruptly excluded the American minister to Spain from\r\npassing through France on his way from London to Madrid. But that\r\nGovernment has unequivocally disavowed any design to deny the right of\r\ntransit to the minister of the United States, and after explanations to\r\nthis effect he has resumed his journey and actually returned through\r\nFrance to Spain. I herewith lay before Congress the correspondence on\r\nthis subject between our envoy at Paris and the minister of foreign\r\nrelations of the French Government.\r\n\r\nThe position of our affairs with Spain remains as at the close of the\r\nlast session. Internal agitation, assuming very nearly the character\r\nof political revolution, has recently convulsed that country. The late\r\nministers were violently expelled from power, and men of very different\r\nviews in relation to its internal affairs have succeeded. Since this\r\nchange there has been no propitious opportunity to resume and press\r\non negotiations for the adjustment of serious questions of difficulty\r\nbetween the Spanish Government and the United States. There is reason\r\nto believe that our minister will find the present Government more\r\nfavorably inclined than the preceding to comply with our just demands\r\nand to make suitable arrangements for restoring harmony and preserving\r\npeace between the two countries.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are pending with Denmark to discontinue the practice of\r\nlevying tolls on our vessels and their cargoes passing through the\r\nSound. I do not doubt that we can claim exemption therefrom as a matter\r\nof right. It is admitted on all hands that this exaction is sanctioned,\r\nnot by the general principles of the law of nations, but only by special\r\nconventions which most of the commercial nations have entered into with\r\nDenmark. The fifth article of our treaty of 1826 with Denmark provides\r\nthat there shall not be paid on the vessels of the United States and\r\ntheir cargoes when passing through the Sound higher duties than those of\r\nthe most favored nations. This may be regarded as an implied agreement\r\nto submit to the tolls during the continuance of the treaty, and\r\nconsequently may embarrass the assertion of our right to be released\r\ntherefrom. There are also other provisions in the treaty which ought to\r\nbe modified. It was to remain in force for ten years and until one year\r\nafter either party should give notice to the other of intention to\r\nterminate it. I deem it expedient that the contemplated notice should\r\nbe given to the Government of Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe naval expedition dispatched about two years since for the purpose\r\nof establishing relations with the Empire of Japan has been ably and\r\nskillfully conducted to a successful termination by the officer to whom\r\nit was intrusted. A treaty opening certain of the ports of that populous\r\ncountry has been negotiated, and in order to give full effect thereto it\r\nonly remains to exchange ratifications and adopt requisite commercial\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe treaty lately concluded between the United States and Mexico settled\r\nsome of our most embarrassing difficulties with that country, but\r\nnumerous claims upon it for wrongs and injuries to our citizens remained\r\nunadjusted, and many new cases have been recently added to the former\r\nlist of grievances. Our legation has been earnest in its endeavors to\r\nobtain from the Mexican Government a favorable consideration of these\r\nclaims, but hitherto without success. This failure is probably in some\r\nmeasure to be ascribed to the disturbed condition of that country.\r\nIt has been my anxious desire to maintain friendly relations with\r\nthe Mexican Republic and to cause its rights and territories to be\r\nrespected, not only by our citizens, but by foreigners who have resorted\r\nto the United States for the purpose of organizing hostile expeditions\r\nagainst some of the States of that Republic. The defenseless condition\r\nin which its frontiers have been left has stimulated lawless adventurers\r\nto embark in these enterprises and greatly increased the difficulty of\r\nenforcing our obligations of neutrality. Regarding it as my solemn duty\r\nto fulfill efficiently these obligations, not only toward Mexico, but\r\nother foreign nations, I have exerted all the powers with which I am\r\ninvested to defeat such proceedings and bring to punishment those who by\r\ntaking a part therein violated our laws. The energy and activity of our\r\ncivil and military authorities have frustrated the designs of those who\r\nmeditated expeditions of this character except in two instances. One of\r\nthese, composed of foreigners, was at first countenanced and aided by\r\nthe Mexican Government itself, it having been deceived as to their\r\nreal object. The other, small in number, eluded the vigilance of the\r\nmagistrates at San Francisco and succeeded in reaching the Mexican\r\nterritories; but the effective measures taken by this Government\r\ncompelled the abandonment of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe commission to establish the new line between the United States and\r\nMexico, according to the provisions of the treaty of the 30th of\r\nDecember last, has been organized, and the work is already commenced.\r\n\r\nOur treaties with the Argentine Confederation and with the Republics of\r\nUruguay and Paraguay secure to us the free navigation of the river La\r\nPlata and some of its larger tributaries, but the same success has not\r\nattended our endeavors to open the Amazon. The reasons in favor of the\r\nfree use of that river I had occasion to present fully in a former\r\nmessage, and, considering the cordial relations which have long existed\r\nbetween this Government and Brazil, it may be expected that pending\r\nnegotiations will eventually reach a favorable result.\r\n\r\nConvenient means of transit between the several parts of a country\r\nare not only desirable for the objects of commercial and personal\r\ncommunication, but essential to its existence under one government.\r\nSeparated, as are the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States,\r\nby the whole breadth of the continent, still the inhabitants of each\r\nare closely bound together by community of origin and institutions and\r\nby strong attachment to the Union. Hence the constant and increasing\r\nintercourse and vast interchange of commercial productions between\r\nthese remote divisions of the Republic. At the present time the most\r\npracticable and only commodious routes for communication between them\r\nare by the way of the isthmus of Central America. It is the duty of the\r\nGovernment to secure these avenues against all danger of interruption.\r\n\r\nIn relation to Central America, perplexing questions existed between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain at the time of the cession of\r\nCalifornia. These, as well as questions which subsequently arose\r\nconcerning interoceanic communication across the Isthmus, were,\r\nas it was supposed, adjusted by the treaty of April 19, 1850, but,\r\nunfortunately, they have been reopened by serious misunderstanding as\r\nto the import of some of its provisions, a readjustment of which is now\r\nunder consideration. Our minister at London has made strenuous efforts\r\nto accomplish this desirable object, but has not yet found it possible\r\nto bring the negotiations to a termination.\r\n\r\nAs incidental to these questions, I deem it proper to notice an\r\noccurrence which happened in Central America near the close of the\r\nlast session of Congress. So soon as the necessity was perceived of\r\nestablishing interoceanic communications across the Isthmus a company\r\nwas organized, under the authority of the State of Nicaragua, but\r\ncomposed for the most part of citizens of the United States, for the\r\npurpose of opening such a transit way by the river San Juan and Lake\r\nNicaragua, which soon became an eligible and much used route in the\r\ntransportation of our citizens and their property between the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific. Meanwhile, and in anticipation of the completion and\r\nimportance of this transit way, a number of adventurers had taken\r\npossession of the old Spanish port at the mouth of the river San Juan\r\nin open defiance of the State or States of Central America, which\r\nupon their becoming independent had rightfully succeeded to the local\r\nsovereignty and jurisdiction of Spain. These adventurers undertook to\r\nchange the name of the place from San Juan del Norte to Greytown, and\r\nthough at first pretending to act as the subjects of the fictitious\r\nsovereign of the Mosquito Indians, they subsequently repudiated the\r\ncontrol of any power whatever, assumed to adopt a distinct political\r\norganization, and declared themselves an independent sovereign state.\r\nIf at some time a faint hope was entertained that they might become\r\na stable and respectable community, that hope soon vanished. They\r\nproceeded to assert unfounded claims to civil jurisdiction over Punta\r\nArenas, a position on the opposite side of the river San Juan, which was\r\nin possession, under a title wholly independent of them, of citizens of\r\nthe United States interested in the Nicaragua Transit Company, and which\r\nwas indispensably necessary to the prosperous operation of that route\r\nacross the Isthmus. The company resisted their groundless claims,\r\nwhereupon they proceeded to destroy some of its buildings and attempted\r\nviolently to dispossess it.\r\n\r\nAt a later period they organized a strong force for the purpose of\r\ndemolishing the establishment at Punta Arenas, but this mischievous\r\ndesign was defeated by the interposition of one of our ships of war at\r\nthat time in the harbor of San Juan. Subsequently to this, in May last,\r\na body of men from Greytown crossed over to Punta Arenas, arrogating\r\nauthority to arrest on the charge of murder a captain of one of the\r\nsteamboats of the Transit Company. Being well aware that the claim to\r\nexercise jurisdiction there would be resisted then, as it had been on\r\nprevious occasions, they went prepared to assert it by force of arms.\r\nOur minister to Central America happened to be present on that occasion.\r\nBelieving that the captain of the steamboat was innocent (for he\r\nwitnessed the transaction on which the charge was founded), and\r\nbelieving also that the intruding party, having no jurisdiction over\r\nthe place where they proposed to make the arrest, would encounter\r\ndesperate resistance if they persisted in their purpose, he interposed,\r\neffectually, to prevent violence and bloodshed. The American minister\r\nafterwards visited Greytown, and whilst he was there a mob, including\r\ncertain of the so-called public functionaries of the place, surrounded\r\nthe house in which he was, avowing that they had come to arrest him by\r\norder of some person exercising the chief authority. While parleying\r\nwith them he was wounded by a missile from the crowd. A boat dispatched\r\nfrom the American steamer _Northern Light_ to release him from the\r\nperilous situation in which he was understood to be was fired into by\r\nthe town guard and compelled to return. These incidents, together with\r\nthe known character of the population of Greytown and their excited\r\nstate, induced just apprehensions that the lives and property of our\r\ncitizens at Punta Arenas would be in imminent danger after the departure\r\nof the steamer, with her passengers, for New York, unless a guard was\r\nleft for their protection. For this purpose, and in order to insure the\r\nsafety of passengers and property passing over the route, a temporary\r\nforce was organized, at considerable expense to the United States, for\r\nwhich provision was made at the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThis pretended community, a heterogeneous assemblage gathered from\r\nvarious countries, and composed for the most part of blacks and persons\r\nof mixed blood, had previously given other indications of mischievous\r\nand dangerous propensities. Early in the same month property was\r\nclandestinely abstracted from the depot of the Transit Company and taken\r\nto Greytown. The plunderers obtained shelter there and their pursuers\r\nwere driven back by its people, who not only protected the wrongdoers\r\nand shared the plunder, but treated with rudeness and violence those who\r\nsought to recover their property.\r\n\r\nSuch, in substance, are the facts submitted to my consideration, and\r\nproved by trustworthy evidence. I could not doubt that the case demanded\r\nthe interposition of this Government. Justice required that reparation\r\nshould be made for so many and such gross wrongs, and that a course of\r\ninsolence and plunder, tending directly to the insecurity of the lives\r\nof numerous travelers and of the rich treasure belonging to our citizens\r\npassing over this transit way, should be peremptorily arrested. Whatever\r\nit might be in other respects, the community in question, in power to do\r\nmischief, was not despicable. It was well provided with ordnance, small\r\narms, and ammunition, and might easily seize on the unarmed boats,\r\nfreighted with millions of property, which passed almost daily within\r\nits reach. It did not profess to belong to any regular government, and\r\nhad, in fact, no recognized dependence on or connection with anyone\r\nto which the United States or their injured citizens might apply for\r\nredress or which could be held responsible in any way for the outrages\r\ncommitted. Not standing before the world in the attitude of an organized\r\npolitical society, being neither competent to exercise the rights nor to\r\ndischarge the obligations of a government, it was, in fact, a marauding\r\nestablishment too dangerous to be disregarded and too guilty to pass\r\nunpunished, and yet incapable of being treated in any other way than\r\nas a piratical resort of outlaws or a camp of savages depredating on\r\nemigrant trains or caravans and the frontier settlements of civilized\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nReasonable notice was given to the people of Greytown that this\r\nGovernment required them to repair the injuries they had done to our\r\ncitizens and to make suitable apology for their insult of our minister,\r\nand that a ship of war would be dispatched thither to enforce compliance\r\nwith these demands. But the notice passed unheeded. Thereupon a\r\ncommander of the Navy, in charge of the sloop of war _Cyane_, was\r\nordered to repeat the demands and to insist upon a compliance therewith.\r\nFinding that neither the populace nor those assuming to have authority\r\nover them manifested any disposition to make the required reparation,\r\nor even to offer excuse for their conduct, he warned them by a public\r\nproclamation that if they did not give satisfaction within a time\r\nspecified he would bombard the town. By this procedure he afforded\r\nthem opportunity to provide for their personal safety. To those also\r\nwho desired to avoid loss of property in the punishment about to be\r\ninflicted on the offending town he furnished the means of removing their\r\neffects by the boats of his own ship and of a steamer which he procured\r\nand tendered to them for that purpose. At length, perceiving no\r\ndisposition on the part of the town to comply with his requisitions, he\r\nappealed to the commander of Her Britannic Majesty's schooner _Bermuda_,\r\nwho was seen to have intercourse and apparently much influence with the\r\nleaders among them, to interpose and persuade them to take some course\r\ncalculated to save the necessity of resorting to the extreme measure\r\nindicated in his proclamation; but that officer, instead of acceding to\r\nthe request, did nothing more than to protest against the contemplated\r\nbombardment. No steps of any sort were taken by the people to give the\r\nsatisfaction required. No individuals, if any there were, who regarded\r\nthemselves as not responsible for the misconduct of the community\r\nadopted any means to separate themselves from the fate of the guilty.\r\nThe several charges on which the demands for redress were founded had\r\nbeen publicly known to all for some time, and were again announced\r\nto them. They did not deny any of these charges; they offered no\r\nexplanation, nothing in extenuation of their conduct, but contumaciously\r\nrefused to hold any intercourse with the commander of the _Cyane_.\r\nBy their obstinate silence they seemed rather desirous to provoke\r\nchastisement than to escape it. There is ample reason to believe that\r\nthis conduct of wanton defiance on their part is imputable chiefly to\r\nthe delusive idea that the American Government would be deterred from\r\npunishing them through fear of displeasing a formidable foreign power,\r\nwhich they presumed to think looked with complacency upon their\r\naggressive and insulting deportment toward the United States. The\r\n_Cyane_ at length fired upon the town. Before much injury had been done\r\nthe fire was twice suspended in order to afford opportunity for an\r\narrangement, but this was declined. Most of the buildings of the place,\r\nof little value generally, were in the sequel destroyed, but, owing to\r\nthe considerate precautions taken by our naval commander, there was no\r\ndestruction of life.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Cyane_ was ordered to Central America, it was confidently\r\nhoped and expected that no occasion would arise for \"a resort to\r\nviolence and destruction of property and loss of life.\" Instructions to\r\nthat effect were given to her commander; and no extreme act would have\r\nbeen requisite had not the people themselves, by their extraordinary\r\nconduct in the affair, frustrated all the possible mild measures for\r\nobtaining satisfaction. A withdrawal from the place, the object of his\r\nvisit entirely defeated, would under the circumstances in which the\r\ncommander of the _Cyane_ found himself have been absolute abandonment\r\nof all claim of our citizens for indemnification and submissive\r\nacquiescence in national indignity. It would have encouraged in these\r\nlawless men a spirit of insolence and rapine most dangerous to the lives\r\nand property of our citizens at Punta Arenas, and probably emboldened\r\nthem to grasp at the treasures and valuable merchandise continually\r\npassing over the Nicaragua route. It certainly would have been most\r\nsatisfactory to me if the objects of the _Cyane's_ mission could have\r\nbeen consummated without any act of public force, but the arrogant\r\ncontumacy of the offenders rendered it impossible to avoid the\r\nalternative either to break up their establishment or to leave them\r\nimpressed with the idea that they might persevere with impunity in\r\na career of insolence and plunder.\r\n\r\nThis transaction has been the subject of complaint on the part of some\r\nforeign powers, and has been characterized with more of harshness than\r\nof justice. If comparisons were to be instituted, it would not be\r\ndifficult to present repeated instances in the history of states\r\nstanding in the very front of modern civilization where communities far\r\nless offending and more defenseless than Greytown have been chastised\r\nwith much greater severity, and where not cities only have been laid in\r\nruins, but human life has been recklessly sacrificed and the blood of\r\nthe innocent made profusely to mingle with that of the guilty.\r\n\r\nPassing from foreign to domestic affairs, your attention is naturally\r\ndirected to the financial condition of the country, always a subject\r\nof general interest. For complete and exact information regarding the\r\nfinances and the various branches of the public service connected\r\ntherewith I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nfrom which it will appear that the amount of revenue during the last\r\nfiscal year from all sources was $73,549,705, and that the public\r\nexpenditures for the same period, exclusive of payments on account of\r\nthe public debt, amounted to $51,018,249. During the same period the\r\npayments made in redemption of the public debt, including interest and\r\npremium, amounted to $24,336,380. To the sum total of the receipts of\r\nthat year is to be added a balance remaining in the Treasury at the\r\ncommencement thereof, amounting to $21,942,892; and at the close of the\r\nsame year a corresponding balance, amounting to $20,137,967, of receipts\r\nabove expenditures also remained in the Treasury. Although, in the\r\nopinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, the receipts of the current\r\nfiscal year are not likely to equal in amount those of the last, yet\r\nthey will undoubtedly exceed the amount of expenditures by at least\r\n$15,000,000. I shall therefore continue to direct that the surplus\r\nrevenue be applied, so far as it can be judiciously and economically\r\ndone, to the reduction of the public debt, the amount of which at the\r\ncommencement of the last fiscal year was $67,340,628; of which there had\r\nbeen paid on the 20th day of November, 1854, the sum of $22,365,172,\r\nleaving a balance of outstanding public debt of only $44,975,456,\r\nredeemable at different periods within fourteen years. There are also\r\nremnants of other Government stocks, most of which are already due, and\r\non which the interest has ceased, but which have not yet been presented\r\nfor payment, amounting to $233,179. This statement exhibits the fact\r\nthat the annual income of the Government greatly exceeds the amount of\r\nits public debt, which latter remains unpaid only because the time of\r\npayment has not yet matured, and it can not be discharged at once except\r\nat the option of public creditors, who prefer to retain the securities\r\nof the United States; and the other fact, not less striking, that the\r\nannual revenue from all sources exceeds by many millions of dollars\r\nthe amount needed for a prudent and economical administration of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe estimates presented to Congress from the different Executive\r\nDepartments at the last session amounted to $38,406,581 and the\r\nappropriations made to the sum of $58,116,958. Of this excess of\r\nappropriations over estimates, however, more than twenty millions was\r\napplicable to extraordinary objects, having no reference to the usual\r\nannual expenditures. Among these objects was embraced ten millions to\r\nmeet the third article of the treaty between the United States and\r\nMexico; so that, in fact, for objects of ordinary expenditure the\r\nappropriations were limited to considerably less than $40,000,000.\r\nI therefore renew my recommendation for a reduction of the duties on\r\nimports. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury presents a series\r\nof tables showing the operation of the revenue system for several\r\nsuccessive years; and as the general principle of reduction of duties\r\nwith a view to revenue, and not protection, may now be regarded as the\r\nsettled policy of the country, I trust that little difficulty will be\r\nencountered in settling the details of a measure to that effect.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I recommend a change in the laws, which\r\nrecent experience has shown to be essential to the protection of the\r\nGovernment. There is no express provision of law requiring the records\r\nand papers of a public character of the several officers of the\r\nGovernment to be left in their offices for the use of their successors,\r\nnor any provision declaring it felony on their part to make false\r\nentries in the books or return false accounts. In the absence of such\r\nexpress provision by law, the outgoing officers in many instances have\r\nclaimed and exercised the right to take into their own possession\r\nimportant books and papers, on the ground that these were their private\r\nproperty, and have placed them beyond the reach of the Government.\r\nConduct of this character, brought in several instances to the notice of\r\nthe present Secretary of the Treasury, naturally awakened his suspicion,\r\nand resulted in the disclosure that at four ports--namely, Oswego,\r\nToledo, Sandusky, and Milwaukee--the Treasury had, by false entries,\r\nbeen defrauded within the four years next preceding March, 1853, of the\r\nsum of $198,000. The great difficulty with which the detection of these\r\nfrauds has been attended, in consequence of the abstraction of books and\r\npapers by the retiring officers, and the facility with which similar\r\nfrauds in the public service may be perpetrated render the necessity of\r\nnew legal enactments in the respects above referred to quite obvious.\r\nFor other material modifications of the revenue laws which seem to me\r\ndesirable, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nThat report and the tables which accompany it furnish ample proofs of\r\nthe solid foundation on which the financial security of the country\r\nrests and of the salutary influence of the independent-treasury system\r\nupon commerce and all monetary operations.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the last year furnishes additional reasons, I regret\r\nto say, of a painful character, for the recommendation heretofore made\r\nto provide for increasing the military force employed in the Territory\r\ninhabited by the Indians. The settlers on the frontier have suffered\r\nmuch from the incursions of predatory bands, and large parties of\r\nemigrants to our Pacific possessions have been massacred with impunity.\r\nThe recurrence of such scenes can only be prevented by teaching these\r\nwild tribes the power of and their responsibility to the United States.\r\nFrom the garrisons of our frontier posts it is only possible to detach\r\ntroops in small bodies; and though these have on all occasions displayed\r\na gallantry and a stern devotion to duty which on a larger field would\r\nhave commanded universal admiration, they have usually suffered severely\r\nin these conflicts with superior numbers, and have sometimes been\r\nentirely sacrificed. All the disposable force of the Army is already\r\nemployed on this service, and is known to be wholly inadequate to the\r\nprotection which should be afforded. The public mind of the country has\r\nbeen recently shocked by savage atrocities committed upon defenseless\r\nemigrants and border settlements, and hardly less by the unnecessary\r\ndestruction of valuable lives where inadequate detachments of troops\r\nhave undertaken to furnish the needed aid. Without increase of the\r\nmilitary force these scenes will be repeated, it is to be feared, on\r\na larger scale and with more disastrous consequences. Congress, I am\r\nsure, will perceive that the plainest duties and responsibilities of\r\nGovernment are involved in this question, and I doubt not that prompt\r\naction may be confidently anticipated when delay must be attended by\r\nsuch fearful hazards.\r\n\r\nThe bill of the last session providing for an increase of the pay of\r\nthe rank and file of the Army has had beneficial results, not only in\r\nfacilitating enlistments, but in obvious improvement in the class of men\r\nwho enter the service. I regret that corresponding consideration was not\r\nbestowed on the officers, who, in view of their character and services\r\nand the expenses to which they are necessarily subject, receive at\r\npresent what is, in my judgment, inadequate compensation.\r\n\r\nThe valuable services constantly rendered by the Army and its\r\ninestimable importance as the nucleus around which the volunteer forces\r\nof the nation can promptly gather in the hour of danger, sufficiently\r\nattest the wisdom of maintaining a military peace establishment; but the\r\ntheory of our system and the wise practice under it require that any\r\nproposed augmentation in time of peace be only commensurate with our\r\nextended limits and frontier relations. While scrupulously adhering\r\nto this principle, I find in existing circumstances a necessity for\r\nincrease of our military force, and it is believed that four new\r\nregiments, two of infantry and two of mounted men, will be sufficient to\r\nmeet the present exigency. If it were necessary carefully to weigh the\r\ncost in a case of such urgency, it would be shown that the additional\r\nexpense would be comparatively light.\r\n\r\nWith the increase of the numerical force of the Army should, I think, be\r\ncombined certain measures of reform in its organic arrangement and\r\nadministration. The present organization is the result of partial\r\nlegislation often directed to special objects and interests; and the\r\nlaws regulating rank and command, having been adopted many years ago\r\nfrom the British code, are not always applicable to our service. It is\r\nnot surprising, therefore, that the system should be deficient in the\r\nsymmetry and simplicity essential to the harmonious working of its\r\nseveral parts, and require a careful revision.\r\n\r\nThe present organization, by maintaining large staff corps or\r\ndepartments, separates many officers from that close connection with\r\ntroops and those active duties in the field which are deemed requisite\r\nto qualify them for the varied responsibilities of high command. Were\r\nthe duties of the Army staff mainly discharged by officers detached\r\nfrom their regiments, it is believed that the special service would be\r\nequally well performed and the discipline and instruction of the Army be\r\nimproved. While due regard to the security of the rights of officers and\r\nto the nice sense of honor which should be cultivated among them would\r\nseem to exact compliance with the established rule of promotion in\r\nordinary cases, still it can hardly be doubted that the range of\r\npromotion by selection, which is now practically confined to the grade\r\nof general officers, might be somewhat extended with benefit to the\r\npublic service. Observance of the rule of seniority sometimes leads,\r\nespecially in time of peace, to the promotion of officers who, after\r\nmeritorious and even distinguished service, may have been rendered\r\nby age or infirmity incapable of performing active duty, and whose\r\nadvancement, therefore, would tend to impair the efficiency of the Army.\r\nSuitable provision for this class of officers, by the creation of a\r\nretired list, would remedy the evil without wounding the just pride of\r\nmen who by past services have established a claim to high consideration.\r\nIn again commending this measure to the favorable consideration of\r\nCongress I would suggest that the power of placing officers on the\r\nretired list be limited to one year. The practical operation of the\r\nmeasure would thus be tested, and if after the lapse of years there\r\nshould be occasion to renew the provision it can be reproduced with any\r\nimprovements which experience may indicate. The present organization\r\nof the artillery into regiments is liable to obvious objections. The\r\nservice of artillery is that of batteries, and an organization of\r\nbatteries into a corps of artillery would be more consistent with the\r\nnature of their duties. A large part of the troops now called artillery\r\nare, and have been, on duty as infantry, the distinction between the\r\ntwo arms being merely nominal. This nominal artillery in our service is\r\ndisproportionate to the whole force and greater than the wants of the\r\ncountry demand. I therefore commend the discontinuance of a distinction\r\nwhich has no foundation in either the arms used or the character of the\r\nservice expected to be performed.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the proposition for the increase of the Army, I have\r\npresented these suggestions with regard to certain measures of reform as\r\nthe complement of a system which would produce the happiest results from\r\na given expenditure, and which, I hope, may attract the early attention\r\nand be deemed worthy of the approval of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy having reference to\r\nmore ample provisions for the discipline and general improvement in the\r\ncharacter of seamen and for the reorganization and gradual increase of\r\nthe Navy I deem eminently worthy of your favorable consideration. The\r\nprinciples which have controlled our policy in relation to the permanent\r\nmilitary force by sea and land are sound, consistent with the theory\r\nof our system, and should by no means be disregarded. But, limiting\r\nthe force to the objects particularly set forth in the preceding part\r\nof this message, we should not overlook the present magnitude and\r\nprospective extension of our commercial marine, nor fail to give due\r\nweight to the fact that besides the 2,000 miles of Atlantic seaboard\r\nwe have now a Pacific coast stretching from Mexico to the British\r\npossessions in the north, teeming with wealth and enterprise and\r\ndemanding the constant presence of ships of war. The augmentation of\r\nthe Navy has not kept pace with the duties properly and profitably\r\nassigned to it in time of peace, and it is inadequate for the large\r\nfield of its operations, not merely in the present, but still more in\r\nthe progressively increasing exigencies of the commerce of the United\r\nStates. I cordially approve of the proposed apprentice system for our\r\nnational vessels recommended by the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence during the last few months of marine disasters of the\r\nmost tragic nature, involving great loss of human life, has produced\r\nintense emotions of sympathy and sorrow throughout the country. It\r\nmay well be doubted whether all these calamitous events are wholly\r\nattributable to the necessary and inevitable dangers of the sea. The\r\nmerchants, mariners, and shipbuilders of the United States are, it is\r\ntrue, unsurpassed in far-reaching enterprise, skill, intelligence, and\r\ncourage by any others in the world. But with the increasing amount of\r\nour commercial tonnage in the aggregate and the larger size and improved\r\nequipment of the ships now constructed a deficiency in the supply of\r\nreliable seamen begins to be very seriously felt. The inconvenience may\r\nperhaps be met in part by due regulation for the introduction into our\r\nmerchant ships of indented apprentices, which, while it would afford\r\nuseful and eligible occupation to numerous young men, would have a\r\ntendency to raise the character of seamen as a class. And it is\r\ndeserving of serious reflection whether it may not be desirable to\r\nrevise the existing laws for the maintenance of discipline at sea, upon\r\nwhich the security of life and property on the ocean must to so great\r\nan extent depend. Although much attention has already been given by\r\nCongress to the proper construction and arrangement of steam vessels and\r\nall passenger ships, still it is believed that the resources of science\r\nand mechanical skill in this direction have not been exhausted. No good\r\nreason exists for the marked distinction which appears upon our statutes\r\nbetween the laws for protecting life and property at sea and those for\r\nprotecting them on land. In most of the States severe penalties are\r\nprovided to punish conductors of trains, engineers, and others employed\r\nin the transportation of persons by railway or by steamboats on rivers.\r\nWhy should not the same principle be applied to acts of insubordination,\r\ncowardice, or other misconduct on the part of masters and mariners\r\nproducing injury or death to passengers on the high seas, beyond the\r\njurisdiction of any of the States, and where such delinquencies can be\r\nreached only by the power of Congress? The whole subject is earnestly\r\ncommended to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General, to which you are referred for many\r\ninteresting details in relation to this important and rapidly extending\r\nbranch of the public service, shows that the expenditure of the year\r\nending June 30, 1854, including $133,483 of balance due to foreign\r\noffices, amounted to $8,710,907. The gross receipts during the same\r\nperiod amounted to $6,955,586, exhibiting an expenditure over income\r\nof $1,755,321 and a diminution of deficiency as compared with the last\r\nyear of $361,756. The increase of the revenue of the Department for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1854, over the preceding year was $970,399, No\r\nproportionate increase, however, can be anticipated for the current\r\nyear, in consequence of the act of Congress of June 23, 1854, providing\r\nfor increased compensation to all postmasters. From these statements it\r\nis apparent that the Post-Office Department, instead of defraying its\r\nexpenses according to the design at the time of its creation, is now,\r\nand under existing laws must continue to be, to no small extent a charge\r\nupon the general Treasury. The cost of mail transportation during the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1854, exceeds the cost of the preceding year\r\nby $495,074. I again call your attention to the subject of mail\r\ntransportation by ocean steamers, and commend the suggestions of the\r\nPostmaster-General to your early attention.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 11,070,935 acres of the public lands have\r\nbeen surveyed and 8,190,017 acres brought into market. The number of\r\nacres sold is 7,035,735 and the amount received therefor $9,285,533.\r\nThe aggregate amount of lands sold, located under military scrip and\r\nland warrants, selected as swamp lands by States, and by locating\r\nunder grants for roads is upward of 23,000,000 acres. The increase of\r\nlands sold over the previous year is about 6,000,000 acres, and the\r\nsales during the first two quarters of the current year present the\r\nextraordinary result of five and a half millions sold, exceeding by\r\nnearly 4,000,000 acres the sales of the corresponding quarters of the\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nThe commendable policy of the Government in relation to setting apart\r\npublic domain for those who have served their country in time of war is\r\nillustrated by the fact that since 1790 no less than 30,000,000 acres\r\nhave been applied to this object.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions which I submitted in my annual message of last year in\r\nreference to grants of land in aid of the construction of railways were\r\nless full and explicit than the magnitude of the subject and subsequent\r\ndevelopments would seem to render proper and desirable. Of the soundness\r\nof the principle then asserted with regard to the limitation of the\r\npower of Congress I entertain no doubt, but in its application it is not\r\nenough that the value of lands in a particular locality may be enhanced;\r\nthat, in fact, a larger amount of money may probably be received in a\r\ngiven time for alternate sections than could have been realized for\r\nall the sections without the impulse and influence of the proposed\r\nimprovements. A prudent proprietor looks beyond limited sections of his\r\ndomain, beyond present results to the ultimate effect which a particular\r\nline of policy is likely to produce upon all his possessions and\r\ninterests. The Government, which is trustee in this matter for the\r\npeople of the States, is bound to take the same wise and comprehensive\r\nview. Prior to and during the last session of Congress upward of\r\n30,000,000 acres of land were withdrawn from public sale with a view\r\nto applications for grants of this character pending before Congress.\r\nA careful review of the whole subject led me to direct that all such\r\norders be abrogated and the lands restored to market, and instructions\r\nwere immediately given to that effect. The applications at the last\r\nsession contemplated the construction of more than 5,000 miles of road\r\nand grants to the amount of nearly 20,000,000 acres of the public\r\ndomain. Even admitting the right on the part of Congress to be\r\nunquestionable, is it quite clear that the proposed grants would be\r\nproductive of good, and not evil? The different projects are confined\r\nfor the present to eleven States of this Union and one Territory. The\r\nreasons assigned for the grants show that it is proposed to put the\r\nworks speedily in process of construction. When we reflect that since\r\nthe commencement of the construction of railways in the United States,\r\nstimulated, as they have been, by the large dividends realized from\r\nthe earlier works over the great thoroughfares and between the most\r\nimportant points of commerce and population, encouraged by State\r\nlegislation, and pressed forward by the amazing energy of private\r\nenterprise, only 17,000 miles have been completed in all the States in a\r\nquarter of a century; when we see the crippled condition of many works\r\ncommenced and prosecuted upon what were deemed to be sound principles\r\nand safe calculations; when we contemplate the enormous absorption\r\nof capital withdrawn from the ordinary channels of business, the\r\nextravagant rates of interest at this moment paid to continue\r\noperations, the bankruptcies, not merely in money but in character, and\r\nthe inevitable effect upon finances generally, can it be doubted that\r\nthe tendency is to run to excess in this matter? Is it wise to augment\r\nthis excess by encouraging hopes of sudden wealth expected to flow\r\nfrom magnificent schemes dependent upon the action of Congress? Does\r\nthe spirit which has produced such results need to be stimulated or\r\nchecked? Is it not the better rule to leave all these works to private\r\nenterprise, regulated and, when expedient, aided by the cooperation of\r\nStates? If constructed by private capital the stimulant and the check go\r\ntogether and furnish a salutary restraint against speculative schemes\r\nand extravagance. But it is manifest that with the most effective guards\r\nthere is danger of going too fast and too far.\r\n\r\nWe may well pause before a proposition contemplating a simultaneous\r\nmovement for the construction of railroads which in extent will equal,\r\nexclusive of the great Pacific road and all its branches, nearly\r\none-third of the entire length of such works now completed in the United\r\nStates, and which can not cost with equipments less than $150,000,000.\r\nThe dangers likely to result from combinations of interests of this\r\ncharacter can hardly be overestimated. But independently of these\r\nconsiderations, where is the accurate knowledge, the comprehensive\r\nintelligence, which shall discriminate between the relative claims of\r\nthese twenty-eight proposed roads in eleven States and one Territory?\r\nWhere will you begin and where end? If to enable these companies to\r\nexecute their proposed works it is necessary that the aid of the General\r\nGovernment be primarily given, the policy will present a problem so\r\ncomprehensive in its bearings and so important to our political and\r\nsocial well-being as to claim in anticipation the severest analysis.\r\nEntertaining these views, I recur with satisfaction to the experience\r\nand action of the last session of Congress as furnishing assurance that\r\nthe subject will not fail to elicit a careful reexamination and rigid\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to present on this occasion some suggestions\r\nregarding internal improvements by the General Government, which want\r\nof time at the close of the last session prevented my submitting on\r\nthe return to the House of Representatives with objections of the bill\r\nentitled \"An act making appropriations for the repair, preservation,\r\nand completion of certain public works heretofore commenced under the\r\nauthority of law;\" but the space in this communication already occupied\r\nwith other matter of immediate public exigency constrains me to reserve\r\nthat subject for a special message, which will be transmitted to the two\r\nHouses of Congress at an early day.\r\n\r\nThe judicial establishment of the United States requires modification,\r\nand certain reforms in the manner of conducting the legal business of\r\nthe Government are also much needed; but as I have addressed you upon\r\nboth of these subjects at length before, I have only to call your\r\nattention to the suggestions then made.\r\n\r\nMy former recommendations in relation to suitable provision for various\r\nobjects of deep interest to the inhabitants of the District of Columbia\r\nare renewed. Many of these objects partake largely of a national\r\ncharacter, and are important independently of their relation to the\r\nprosperity of the only considerable organized community in the Union\r\nentirely unrepresented in Congress.\r\n\r\nI have thus presented suggestions on such subjects as appear to me to\r\nbe of particular interest or importance, and therefore most worthy of\r\nconsideration during the short remaining period allotted to the labors\r\nof the present Congress.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers of the thirteen united colonies, in acquiring their\r\nindependence and in founding this Republic of the United States of\r\nAmerica, have devolved upon us, their descendants, the greatest and the\r\nmost noble trust ever committed to the hands of man, imposing upon all,\r\nand especially such as the public will may have invested for the time\r\nbeing with political functions, the most sacred obligations. We have to\r\nmaintain inviolate the great doctrine of the inherent right of popular\r\nself-government; to reconcile the largest liberty of the individual\r\ncitizen with complete security of the public order; to render cheerful\r\nobedience to the laws of the land, to unite in enforcing their\r\nexecution, and to frown indignantly on all combinations to resist\r\nthem; to harmonize a sincere and ardent devotion to the institutions\r\nof religious faith with the most universal religious toleration; to\r\npreserve the rights of all by causing each to respect those of the\r\nother; to carry forward every social improvement to the uttermost limit\r\nof human perfectibility, by the free action of mind upon mind, not by\r\nthe obtrusive intervention of misapplied force; to uphold the integrity\r\nand guard the limitations of our organic law; to preserve sacred\r\nfrom all touch of usurpation, as the very palladium of our political\r\nsalvation, the reserved rights and powers of the several States and of\r\nthe people; to cherish with loyal fealty and devoted affection this\r\nUnion, as the only sure foundation on which the hopes of civil liberty\r\nrest; to administer government with vigilant integrity and rigid\r\neconomy; to cultivate peace and friendship with foreign nations, and to\r\ndemand and exact equal justice from all, but to do wrong to none; to\r\neschew intermeddling with the national policy and the domestic repose of\r\nother governments, and to repel it from our own; never to shrink from\r\nwar when the rights and the honor of the country call us to arms, but\r\nto cultivate in preference the arts of peace, seek enlargement of the\r\nrights of neutrality, and elevate and liberalize the intercourse of\r\nnations; and by such just and honorable means, and such only, whilst\r\nexalting the condition of the Republic, to assure to it the legitimate\r\ninfluence and the benign authority of a great example amongst all the\r\npowers of Christendom.\r\n\r\nUnder the solemnity of these convictions the blessing of Almighty God is\r\nearnestly invoked to attend upon your deliberations and upon all the\r\ncounsels and acts of the Government, to the end that, with common zeal\r\nand common efforts, we may, in humble submission to the divine will,\r\ncooperate for the promotion of the supreme good of these United States.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to approval,\r\na compact between the United States and the royal Government of Lew\r\nChew, entered into at Napa on the 11th day of July last, for securing\r\ncertain privileges to vessels of the United States resorting to the Lew\r\nChew Islands.\r\n\r\nA copy of the instructions of the Secretary of State upon the subject is\r\nalso herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1894_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention for regulating the right of inheriting and\r\nacquiring property, concluded in this city on the 21st day of August\r\nlast between the United States and His Highness the Duke of Brunswick\r\nand Luneburg.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAn act for the relief of the legal representatives of Samuel Prioleau,\r\ndeceased, which provided for the payment of the sum of $6,928.60 to the\r\nlegal representatives of said Prioleau by the proper accounting officer\r\nof the Treasury, was approved by me July 27, 1854. It having been\r\nascertained that the identical claim provided for in this act was\r\nliquidated and paid under the provisions of the general act of August 4,\r\n1790, and of the special act of January 24, 1795, the First Comptroller\r\nof the Treasury declined to give effect to the law first above referred\r\nto without communicating the facts for my consideration. This refusal\r\nI regard as fully justified by the facts upon which it was predicated.\r\n\r\nIn view of the destruction of valuable papers by fire in the building\r\noccupied by the Treasury Department in 1814 and again in 1833, it is not\r\nsurprising that cases like this should, more than seventy years after\r\nthe transaction with which they were connected, be involved in much\r\ndoubt. The report of the Comptroller, however, shows conclusively by\r\nrecord evidence still preserved in the Department and elsewhere that the\r\nsum of $6,122.44, with $3,918.36 interest thereon from the date of the\r\ndestruction of the property, making the sum of $10,040.80, was allowed\r\nto Samuel Prioleau under the act for his relief passed in 1795.\r\n\r\nThat amount was reported by the Auditor to the Comptroller on the\r\n4th day of February, 1795, to be funded as follows, to wit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Two thirds of $6,122.44 called 6 per cent stock   $4,081.63\r\n  One third called deferred stock                    2,040.81\r\n  Interest on the principal, called 3 per cent stock 3,918.36\r\n\r\n  Total                                             10,040.80\r\n\r\n  On the books of the loan office of South Carolina, under date of April\r\n  27, 1795 is an entry showing that there was issued of the funded 6 per\r\n  cent stock to\r\n\r\n  Samuel Prioleau                                    4,081.63\r\n  Of the deferred stock                              2,040.81\r\n  Of the 3 per cent stock                            3,918.36\r\n\r\n  Total                                             10,040.80\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the ledger of said loan office an account was opened with Samuel\r\nPrioleau, in which he was credited with the three items of stock and\r\ndeputed by the transfer of each certificate to certain persons named,\r\nunder dates of May 20, 1795, August 24, 1795, and April 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nThese records show that the account of Samuel Prioleau, required to be\r\nsettled by the act of January 28, 1795, was settled; that the value of\r\nthe property destroyed was allowed; that the amount so found due was\r\nfunded by said Prioleau and entered by his order on the loan-office\r\nbooks of South Carolina, and soon thereafter by him sold and\r\ntransferred. That the entire funded debt of the United States was long\r\nsince paid is matter of history.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the claim has been prosecuted under a\r\nmisapprehension on the part of the present claimants.\r\n\r\nI present the evidence in the case collected by the First Comptroller\r\nand embodied in his report for your consideration, together with a copy\r\nof a letter just received by that officer from the executor of P.G.\r\nPrioleau, and respectfully recommend the repeal of the act of July 27,\r\n1854.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying documents,[33] in compliance with the resolution of the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the 27th of July last.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Correspondence of the American consul-general at Cairo\r\nrelative to the expulsion of the Greeks from Egypt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 11, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nrequesting authority to invest the sum of $6,561.80, received from the\r\nsales of lands in the Chickasaw cession, in stocks for the benefit of\r\nthe Chickasaw national fund, as required by the eleventh article of the\r\ntreaty with the Chickasaws of the 20th October, 1832, and the act of\r\nCongress of 11th September, 1841.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I transmit a report of the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers,[34] in answer to the resolution of the Senate\r\nof the 3d of August last.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Correspondence relative to difficulties between Rev.\r\nJonas King and the Government of Greece.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 16, 1854_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\npapers,[35] in answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nof the 27th of July last.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Relating to the case of Walter M.

The employment of volunteer troops, as suggested by\r\nthe Secretary, seems to afford the only practicable means of providing\r\nfor the present emergency.\r\n\r\nThere is much reason to believe that other cases similar in character\r\nto those particularly referred to in the accompanying papers will at\r\nan early day require vigorous measures and the exhibition of a strong\r\nmilitary force. The proposed temporary provision to meet a special\r\ndemand, so far from obviating, in my judgment only serves to illustrate\r\nthe urgent necessity of an increase of the Regular Army, at least to\r\nthe extent recommended in my late annual message. Unless by the plan\r\nproposed, or some other equally effective, a force can be early brought\r\ninto the field adequate to the suppression of existing hostilities, the\r\ncombination of predatory bands will be extended and the difficulty of\r\nrestoring order and security greatly magnified. On the other hand,\r\nwithout a permanent military force of sufficient strength to control\r\nthe unfriendly Indians, it may be expected that hostilities will soon\r\nbe renewed and that years of border warfare will afflict the country,\r\nretarding the progress of settlement, exposing emigrant trains to savage\r\nbarbarities and consuming millions of the public money.\r\n\r\nThe state of things made known in various letters recently received\r\nat the War Department, extracts from a portion of which are herewith\r\ninclosed, is calculated to augment the deep solicitude which this matter\r\nhas for some time past awakened, and which has been earnestly expressed\r\nin previous messages and in the annual reports of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI respectfully submit that the facts now communicated urgently call for\r\nimmediate action on the part of Congress.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 17, 1855_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn further compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 5th\r\nof December last, requesting copies of correspondence[36] between\r\nMajor-General Wool and the different Departments of the Government,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents by\r\nwhich it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Relating to affairs on the Pacific Coast.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 19, 1855_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn further compliance with the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 27th of July last, upon the subject of the case\r\nof Walter M.

Although the President is required from time to time\r\nto recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall\r\njudge necessary and expedient, his participation in the formal business\r\nof legislation is limited to the single duty, in a certain contingency,\r\nof demanding for a bill a particular form of vote prescribed by the\r\nConstitution before it can become a law. He is not invested with power\r\nto defeat legislation by an absolute veto, but only to restrain it, and\r\nis charged with the duty, in case he disapproves a measure, of invoking\r\na second and a more deliberate and solemn consideration of it on the\r\npart of Congress. It is not incumbent on the President to sign a bill\r\nas a matter of course, and thus merely to authenticate the action of\r\nCongress, for he must exercise intelligent judgment or be faithless to\r\nthe trust reposed in him. If he approve a bill, he shall sign it, but\r\nif not he shall return it with his objections to that House in which\r\nit shall have originated for such further action as the Constitution\r\ndemands, which is its enactment, if at all, not by a bare numerical\r\nmajority, as in the first instance, but by a constitutional majority\r\nof two-thirds of both Houses.\r\n\r\nWhile the Constitution thus confers on the legislative bodies the\r\ncomplete power of legislation in all cases, it proceeds, in the spirit\r\nof justice, to provide for the protection of the responsibility of the\r\nPresident. It does not compel him to affix the signature of approval to\r\nany bill unless it actually have his approbation; for while it requires\r\nhim to sign if he approve, it, in my judgment, imposes upon him the duty\r\nof withholding his signature if he do not approve. In the execution of\r\nhis official duty in this respect he is not to perform a mere mechanical\r\npart, but is to decide and act according to conscientious convictions of\r\nthe rightfulness or wrongfulness of the proposed law. In a matter as to\r\nwhich he is doubtful in his own mind he may well defer to the majority\r\nof the two Houses. Individual members of the respective Houses, owing to\r\nthe nature, variety, and amount of business pending, must necessarily\r\nrely for their guidance in many, perhaps most, cases, when the matters\r\ninvolved are not of popular interest, upon the investigation of\r\nappropriate committees, or, it may be, that of a single member, whose\r\nattention has been particularly directed to the subject. For similar\r\nreasons, but even to a greater extent, from the number and variety of\r\nsubjects daily urged upon his attention, the President naturally relies\r\nmuch upon the investigation had and the results arrived at by the two\r\nHouses, and hence those results, in large classes of cases, constitute\r\nthe basis upon which his approval rests. The President's responsibility\r\nis to the whole people of the United States, as that of a Senator is to\r\nthe people of a particular State, that of a Representative to the people\r\nof a State or district; and it may be safely assumed that he will not\r\nresort to the clearly defined and limited power of arresting legislation\r\nand calling for reconsideration of any measure except in obedience\r\nto requirements of duty. When, however, he entertains a decisive and\r\nfixed conclusion, not merely of the unconstitutionality, but of the\r\nimpropriety, or injustice in other respects, of any measure, if he\r\ndeclare that he approves it he is false to his oath, and he deliberately\r\ndisregards his constitutional obligations.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully recognize the weight of authority which attaches to the\r\naction of a majority of the two Houses. But in this case, as in some\r\nothers, the framers of our Constitution, for wise considerations of\r\npublic good, provided that nothing less than a two-thirds vote of one\r\nor both of the Houses of Congress shall become effective to bind the\r\ncoordinate departments of the Government, the people, and the several\r\nStates. If there be anything of seeming invidiousness in the official\r\nright thus conferred on the President, it is in appearance only, for the\r\nsame right of approving or disapproving a bill, according to each one's\r\nown judgment, is conferred on every member of the Senate and of the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, therefore, that the circumstances must be extraordinary\r\nwhich would induce the President to withhold approval from a bill\r\ninvolving no violation of the Constitution. The amount of the claims\r\nproposed to be discharged by the bill before me, the nature of the\r\ntransactions in which those claims are alleged to have originated,\r\nthe length of time during which they have occupied the attention of\r\nCongress and the country, present such an exigency. Their history\r\nrenders it impossible that a President who has participated to any\r\nconsiderable degree in public affairs could have failed to form\r\nrespecting them a decided opinion upon what he would deem satisfactory\r\ngrounds. Nevertheless, instead of resting on former opinions, it has\r\nseemed to me proper to review and more carefully examine the whole\r\nsubject, so as satisfactorily to determine the nature and extent of my\r\nobligations in the premises.\r\n\r\nI feel called upon at the threshold to notice an assertion, often\r\nrepeated, that the refusal of the United States to satisfy these claims\r\nin the manner provided by the present bill rests as a stain on the\r\njustice of our country. If it be so, the imputation on the public honor\r\nis aggravated by the consideration that the claims are coeval with the\r\npresent century, and it has been a persistent wrong during that whole\r\nperiod of time. The allegation is that private property has been taken\r\nfor public use without just compensation, in violation of express\r\nprovision of the Constitution, and that reparation has been withheld\r\nand justice denied until the injured parties have for the most part\r\ndescended to the grave. But it is not to be forgotten or overlooked that\r\nthose who represented the people in different capacities at the time\r\nwhen the alleged obligations were incurred, and to whom the charge of\r\ninjustice attaches in the first instance, have also passed away and\r\nborne with them the special information which controlled their decision\r\nand, it may be well presumed, constituted the justification of their\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the charge in question be well founded, although its\r\nadmission would inscribe on our history a page which we might desire\r\nmost of all to obliterate, and although, if true, it must painfully\r\ndisturb our confidence in the justice and the high sense of moral and\r\npolitical responsibility of those whose memories we have been taught\r\nto cherish with so much reverence and respect, still we have only one\r\ncourse of action left to us, and that is to make the most prompt and\r\nample reparation in our power and consign the wrong as far as may be\r\nto forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nBut no such heavy sentence of condemnation should be lightly passed upon\r\nthe sagacious and patriotic men who participated in the transactions out\r\nof which these claims are supposed to have arisen, and who, from their\r\nample means of knowledge of the general subject in its minute details\r\nand from their official position, are peculiarly responsible for\r\nwhatever there is of wrong or injustice in the decisions of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nTheir justification consists in that which constitutes the objection to\r\nthe present bill, namely, the absence of any indebtedness on the part\r\nof the United States. The charge of denial of justice in this case, and\r\nconsequent stain upon our national character, has not yet been indorsed\r\nby the American people. But if it were otherwise, this bill, so far from\r\nrelieving the past, would only stamp on the present a more deep and\r\nindelible stigma. It admits the justice of the claims, concedes that\r\npayment has been wrongfully withheld for fifty years, and then proposes\r\nnot to pay them, but to compound with the public creditors by providing\r\nthat, whether the claims shall be presented or not, whether the sum\r\nappropriated shall pay much or little of what shall be found due, the\r\nlaw itself shall constitute a perpetual bar to all future demands. This\r\nis not, in my judgment, the way to atone for wrongs if they exist, nor\r\nto meet subsisting obligations.\r\n\r\nIf new facts, not known or not accessible during the Administration of\r\nMr. Jefferson, Mr. Madison, or Mr. Monroe, had since been brought to\r\nlight, or new sources of information discovered, this would greatly\r\nrelieve the subject of embarrassment. But nothing of this nature has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThat those eminent statesmen had the best means of arriving at a correct\r\nconclusion no one will deny. That they never recognized the alleged\r\nobligation on the part of the Government is shown by the history of\r\ntheir respective Administrations. Indeed, it stands not as a matter of\r\ncontrolling authority, but as a fact of history, that these claims have\r\nnever since our existence as a nation been deemed by any President\r\nworthy of recommendation to Congress.\r\n\r\nClaims to payment can rest only on the plea of indebtedness on the part\r\nof the Government. This requires that it should be shown that the United\r\nStates have incurred liability to the claimants, either by such acts as\r\ndeprived them of their property or by having actually taken it for\r\npublic use without making just compensation for it.\r\n\r\nThe first branch of the proposition--that on which an equitable claim\r\nto be indemnified by the United States for losses sustained might\r\nrest--requires at least a cursory examination of the history of the\r\ntransactions on which the claims depend. The first link which in the\r\nchain of events arrests attention is the treaties of alliance and of\r\namity and commerce between the United States and France negotiated in\r\n1778. By those treaties peculiar privileges were secured to the armed\r\nvessels of each of the contracting parties in the ports of the other,\r\nthe freedom of trade was greatly enlarged, and mutual obligations were\r\nincurred by each to guarantee to the other their territorial possessions\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nIn 1792-93, when war broke out between France and Great Britain, the\r\nformer claimed privileges in American ports which our Government did\r\nnot admit as deducible from the treaties of 1778, and which it was held\r\nwere in conflict with obligations to the other belligerent powers. The\r\nliberal principle of one of the treaties referred to--that free ships\r\nmake free goods, and that subsistence and supplies were not contraband\r\nof war unless destined to a blockaded port--was found, in a commercial\r\nview, to operate disadvantageously to France as compared with her enemy,\r\nGreat Britain, the latter asserting, under the law of nations, the right\r\nto capture as contraband supplies when bound for an enemy's port.\r\n\r\nInduced mainly, it is believed, by these considerations, the Government\r\nof France decreed on the 9th of May, 1793, the first year of the war,\r\nthat \"the French people are no longer permitted to fulfill toward the\r\nneutral powers in general the vows they have so often manifested, and\r\nwhich they constantly make for the full and entire liberty of commerce\r\nand navigation,\" and, as a counter measure to the course of Great\r\nBritain, authorized the seizure of neutral vessels bound to an enemy's\r\nport in like manner as that was done by her great maritime rival.\r\nThis decree was made to act retrospectively, and to continue until the\r\nenemies of France should desist from depredations on the neutral vessels\r\nbound to the ports of France. Then followed the embargo, by which our\r\nvessels were detained in Bordeaux; the seizure of British goods on\r\nboard of our ships, and of the property of American citizens under the\r\npretense that it belonged to English subjects, and the imprisonment of\r\nAmerican citizens captured on the high seas.\r\n\r\nAgainst these infractions of existing treaties and violations of our\r\nrights as a neutral power we complained and remonstrated. For the\r\nproperty of our injured citizens we demanded that due compensation\r\nshould be made, and from 1793 to 1797 used every means, ordinary and\r\nextraordinary, to obtain redress by negotiation. In the last-mentioned\r\nyear these efforts were met by a refusal to receive a minister sent\r\nby our Government with special instructions to represent the amicable\r\ndisposition of the Government and people of the United States and their\r\ndesire to remove jealousies and to restore confidence by showing that\r\nthe complaints against them were groundless. Failing in this, another\r\nattempt to adjust all differences between the two Republics was made in\r\nthe form of an extraordinary mission, composed of three distinguished\r\ncitizens, but the refusal to receive was offensively repeated, and thus\r\nterminated this last effort to preserve peace and restore kind relations\r\nwith our early friend and ally, to whom a debt of gratitude was due\r\nwhich the American people have never been willing to depreciate or to\r\nforget. Years of negotiation had not only failed to secure indemnity\r\nfor our citizens and exemption from further depredation, but these\r\nlong-continued efforts had brought upon the Government the suspension\r\nof diplomatic intercourse with France and such indignities as to induce\r\nPresident Adams, in his message of May 16, 1797, to Congress, convened\r\nin special session, to present it as the particular matter for their\r\nconsideration and to speak of it in terms of the highest indignation.\r\nThenceforward the action of our Government assumed a character which\r\nclearly indicates that hope was no longer entertained from the amicable\r\nfeeling or justice of the Government of France, and hence the subsequent\r\nmeasures were those of force.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May, 1798, an act was passed for the employment of the\r\nNavy of the United States against \"armed vessels of the Republic of\r\nFrance,\" and authorized their capture if \"found hovering on the coast\r\nof the United States for the purpose of committing depredations on the\r\nvessels belonging to the citizens thereof;\" on the 18th of June, 1798,\r\nan act was passed prohibiting commercial intercourse with France under\r\nthe penalty of the forfeiture of the vessels so employed; on the 25th\r\nof June, the same year, an act to arm the merchant marine to oppose\r\nsearches, capture aggressors, and recapture American vessels taken by\r\nthe French; on the 28th of June, same year, an act for the condemnation\r\nand sale of French vessels captured by authority of the act of 28th of\r\nMay preceding; on the 27th of July, same year, an act abrogating the\r\ntreaties and the convention which had been concluded between the United\r\nStates and France, and declaring \"that the same shall not henceforth\r\nbe regarded as legally obligatory on the Government or citizens of the\r\nUnited States;\" on the 9th of the same month an act was passed which\r\nenlarged the limits of the hostilities then existing by authorizing our\r\npublic vessels to capture armed vessels of France wherever found upon\r\nthe high seas, and conferred power on the President to issue commissions\r\nto private armed vessels to engage in like service.\r\n\r\nThese acts, though short of a declaration of war, which would put ail\r\nthe citizens of each country in hostility with those of the other, were,\r\nnevertheless, actual war, partial in its application, maritime in its\r\ncharacter, but which required the expenditure of much of our public\r\ntreasure and much of the blood of our patriotic citizens, who, in\r\nvessels but little suited to the purposes of war, went forth to battle\r\non the high seas for the rights and security of their fellow-citizens\r\nand to repel indignities offered to the national honor.\r\n\r\nIt is not, then, because of any failure to use all available means,\r\ndiplomatic and military, to obtain reparation that liability for private\r\nclaims can have been incurred by the United States, and if there is any\r\npretense for such liability it must flow from the action, not from the\r\nneglect, of the United States. The first complaint on the part of France\r\nwas against the proclamation of President Washington of April 22, 1793.\r\nAt that early period in the war which involved Austria, Prussia,\r\nSardinia, the United Netherlands, and Great Britain on the one part and\r\nFrance on the other, the great and wise man who was the Chief Executive,\r\nas he was and had been the guardian of our then infant Republic,\r\nproclaimed that \"the duty and interest of the United States require that\r\nthey should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct\r\nfriendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers.\" This attitude of\r\nneutrality, it was pretended, was in disregard of the obligations of\r\nalliance between the United States and France. And this, together with\r\nthe often-renewed complaint that the stipulations of the treaties of\r\n1778 had not been observed and executed by the United States, formed the\r\npretext for the series of outrages upon our Government and its citizens\r\nwhich finally drove us to seek redress and safety by an appeal to force.\r\nThe treaties of 1778, so long the subject of French complaints, are now\r\nunderstood to be the foundation upon which are laid these claims of\r\nindemnity from the United States for spoliations committed by the French\r\nprior to 1800. The act of our Government which abrogated not only the\r\ntreaties of 1778, but also the subsequent consular convention of 1788,\r\nhas already been referred to, and it may be well here to inquire what\r\nthe course of France was in relation thereto. By the decrees of 9th of\r\nMay, 1793, 7th of July, 1796, and 2d of March, 1797, the stipulations\r\nwhich were then and subsequently most important to the United States\r\nwere rendered wholly inoperative. The highly injurious effects which\r\nthese decrees are known to have produced show how vital were the\r\nprovisions of treaty which they violated, and make manifest the\r\nincontrovertible right of the United States to declare, as the\r\nconsequence of these acts of the other contracting party, the treaties\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nThe next step in this inquiry is whether the act declaring the treaties\r\nnull and void was ever repealed, or whether by any other means the\r\ntreaties were ever revived so as to be either the subject or the source\r\nof national obligation. The war which has been described was terminated\r\nby the treaty of Paris of 1800, and to that instrument it is necessary\r\nto turn to find how much of preexisting obligations between the two\r\nGovernments outlived the hostilities in which they had been engaged.\r\nBy the second article of the treaty of 1800 it was declared that the\r\nministers plenipotentiary of the two parties not being able to agree\r\nrespecting the treaties of alliance, amity, and commerce of 1778 and the\r\nconvention of 1788, nor upon the indemnities mutually due or claimed,\r\nthe parties will negotiate further on these subjects at a convenient\r\ntime; and until they shall have agreed upon these points the said\r\ntreaties and convention shall have no operation.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty was submitted to the Senate of the United States, the\r\nsecond article was disagreed to and the treaty amended by striking it\r\nout and inserting a provision that the convention then made should\r\ncontinue in force eight years from the date of ratification, which\r\nconvention, thus amended, was accepted by the First Consul of France,\r\nwith the addition of a note explanatory of his construction of the\r\nconvention, to the effect that by the retrenchment of the second article\r\nthe two States renounce the respective pretensions which were the object\r\nof the said article.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived by the language of the second article, as\r\noriginally framed by the negotiators, that they had found themselves\r\nunable to adjust the controversies on which years of diplomacy and of\r\nhostilities had been expended, and that they were at last compelled to\r\npostpone the discussion of those questions to that most indefinite\r\nperiod, a \"convenient time.\" All, then, of these subjects which was\r\nrevived by the convention was the right to renew, when it should be\r\nconvenient to the parties, a discussion which had already exhausted\r\nnegotiation, involved the two countries in a maritime war, and on which\r\nthe parties had approached no nearer to concurrence than they were when\r\nthe controversy began.\r\n\r\nThe obligations of the treaties of 1778 and the convention of 1788 were\r\nmutual, and estimated to be equal. But however onerous they may have\r\nbeen to the United States, they had been abrogated, and were not revived\r\nby the convention of 1800, but expressly spoken of as suspended until an\r\nevent which could only occur by the pleasure of the United States. It\r\nseems clear, then, that the United States were relieved of no obligation\r\nto France by the retrenchment of the second article of the convention,\r\nand if thereby France was relieved of any valid claims against her the\r\nUnited States received no consideration in return, and that if private\r\nproperty was taken by the United States from their own citizens it was\r\nnot for public use. But it is here proper to inquire whether the United\r\nStates did relieve France from valid claims against her on the part of\r\ncitizens of the United States, and did thus deprive them of their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe complaints and counter complaints of the two Governments had been\r\nthat treaties were violated and that both public and individual rights\r\nand interests had been sacrificed. The correspondence of our ministers\r\nengaged in negotiations, both before and after the convention of 1800,\r\nsufficiently proves how hopeless was the effort to obtain full indemnity\r\nfrom France for injuries inflicted on our commerce from 1793 to 1800,\r\nunless it should be by an account in which the rival pretensions of the\r\ntwo Governments should each be acknowledged and the balance struck\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIt is supposable, and may be inferred from the contemporaneous history\r\nas probable, that had the United States agreed in 1800 to revive the\r\ntreaties of 1778 and 1788 with the construction which France had placed\r\nupon them, that the latter Government would, on the other hand, have\r\nagreed to make indemnity for those spoliations which were committed\r\nunder the pretext that the United States were faithless to the\r\nobligations of the alliance between the two countries.\r\n\r\nHence the conclusion that the United States did not sacrifice private\r\nrights or property to get rid of public obligations, but only refused to\r\nreassume public obligations for the purpose of obtaining the recognition\r\nof the claims of American citizens on the part of France.\r\n\r\nAll those claims which the French Government was willing to admit were\r\ncarefully provided for elsewhere in the convention, and the declaration\r\nof the First Consul, which was appended in his additional note, had no\r\nother application than to the claims which had been mutually made by the\r\nGovernments, but on which they had never approximated to an adjustment.\r\nIn confirmation of the fact that our Government did not intend to cease\r\nfrom the prosecution of the just claims of our citizens against France,\r\nreference is here made to the annual message of President Jefferson of\r\nDecember 8, 1801, which opens with expressions of his gratification at\r\nthe restoration of peace among sister nations; and, after speaking of\r\nthe assurances received from all nations with whom we had principal\r\nrelations and of the confidence thus inspired that our peace with them\r\nwould not have been disturbed if they had continued at war with each\r\nother, he proceeds to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n  But a cessation of irregularities which had affected the commerce of\r\n  neutral nations, and of the irritations and injuries produced by them,\r\n  can not but add to this confidence, and strengthens at the same time the\r\n  hope that wrongs committed on unoffending friends under a pressure of\r\n  circumstances will now be reviewed with candor, and will be considered\r\n  as founding just claims of retribution for the past and new assurance\r\n  for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe zeal and diligence with which the claims of our citizens against\r\nFrance were prosecuted appear in the diplomatic correspondence of the\r\nthree years next succeeding the convention of 1800, and the effect of\r\nthese efforts is made manifest in the convention of 1803, in which\r\nprovision was made for payment of a class of cases the consideration of\r\nwhich France had at all previous periods refused to entertain, and which\r\nare of that very class which it has been often assumed were released by\r\nstriking out the second article of the convention of 1800. This is shown\r\nby reference to the preamble and to the fourth and fifth articles of the\r\nconvention of 1803, by which were admitted among the debts due by France\r\nto citizens of the United States the amounts chargeable for \"prizes made\r\nat sea in which the appeal has been properly lodged within the time\r\nmentioned in the said convention of the 30th of September, 1800;\" and\r\nthis class was further defined to be only \"captures of which the council\r\nof prizes shall have ordered restitution, it being well understood that\r\nthe claimant can not have recourse to the United States otherwise than\r\nhe might have had to the French Republic, and only in case of the\r\ninsufficiency of the captors.\"\r\n\r\nIf, as was affirmed on all hands, the convention of 1803 was intended\r\nto close all questions between the Governments of France and the United\r\nStates, and 20,000,000 francs were set apart as a sum which might\r\nexceed, but could not fall short of, the debts due by France to the\r\ncitizens of the United States, how are we to reconcile the claim now\r\npresented with the estimates made by those who were of the time and\r\nimmediately connected with the events, and whose intelligence and\r\nintegrity have in no small degree contributed to the character and\r\nprosperity of the country in which we live? Is it rational to assume\r\nthat the claimants who now present themselves for indemnity by the\r\nUnited States represent debts which would have been admitted and paid by\r\nFrance but for the intervention of the United States? And is it possible\r\nto escape from the effect of the voluminous evidence tending to\r\nestablish the fact that France resisted all these claims; that it was\r\nonly after long and skillful negotiation that the agents of the United\r\nStates obtained the recognition of such of the claims as were provided\r\nfor in the conventions of 1800 and 1803? And is it not conclusive\r\nagainst any pretensions of possible success on the part of the\r\nclaimants, if left unaided to make their applications to France, that\r\nthe only debts due to American citizens which have been paid by France\r\nare those which were assumed by the United States as part of the\r\nconsideration in the purchase of Louisiana?\r\n\r\nThere is little which is creditable either to the judgment or patriotism\r\nof those of our fellow-citizens who at this day arraign the justice,\r\nthe fidelity, or love of country of the men who founded the Republic in\r\nrepresenting them as having bartered away the property of individuals to\r\nescape from public obligations, and then to have withheld from them just\r\ncompensation. It has been gratifying to me in tracing the history of\r\nthese claims to find that ample evidence exists to refute an accusation\r\nwhich would impeach the purity, the justice, and the magnanimity of the\r\nillustrious men who guided and controlled the early destinies of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nI pass from this review of the history of the subject, and, omitting\r\nmany substantial objections to these claims, proceed to examine somewhat\r\nmore closely the only grounds upon which they can by possibility be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on this it may be proper to state distinctly certain\r\npropositions which it is admitted on all hands are essential to prove\r\nthe obligations of the Government.\r\n\r\nFirst. That at the date of the treaty of September 30, 1800, these\r\nclaims were valid and subsisting as against France.\r\n\r\nSecond. That they were released or extinguished by the United States in\r\nthat treaty and by the manner of its ratification.\r\n\r\nThird. That they were so released or extinguished for a consideration\r\nvaluable to the Government, but in which the claimants had no more\r\ninterest than any other citizens.\r\n\r\nThe convention between the French Republic and the United States of\r\nAmerica signed at Paris on the 30th day of September, 1800, purports\r\nin the preamble to be founded on the equal desire of the First Consul\r\n(Napoleon Bonaparte) and the President of the United States to terminate\r\nthe differences which have arisen between the two States. It declares,\r\nin the first place, that there shall be firm, inviolable, and universal\r\npeace and a true and sincere friendship between the French Republic and\r\nthe United States. Next it proceeds, in the second, third, fourth, and\r\nfifth articles, to make provision in sundry respects, having reference\r\nto past differences and the transition from the state of war between the\r\ntwo countries to that of general and permanent peace. Finally, in the\r\nresidue of the twenty-seventh article, it stipulates anew the conditions\r\nof amity and intercourse, commercial and political, thereafter to exist,\r\nand, of course, to be substituted in place of the previous conditions of\r\nthe treaties of alliance and of commerce and the consular convention,\r\nwhich are thus tacitly but unequivocally recognized as no longer in\r\nforce, but in effect abrogated, either by the state of war or by the\r\npolitical action of the two Republics.\r\n\r\nExcept in so far as the whole convention goes to establish the fact that\r\nthe previous treaties were admitted on both sides to be at an end, none\r\nof the articles are directly material to the present question save the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ART. II. The ministers plenipotentiary of the two parties not being able\r\n  to agree at present respecting the treaty of alliance of 6th February,\r\n  1778, the treaty of amity and commerce of the same date, and the\r\n  convention of 14th of November, 1788, nor upon the indemnities mutually\r\n  due or claimed, the parties will negotiate further on these subjects at\r\n  a convenient time; and until they may have agreed upon these points the\r\n  said treaties and convention shall have no operation, and the relations\r\n  of the two countries shall be regulated as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ART. V. The debts contracted by one of the two nations with individuals\r\n  of the other, or by the individuals of one with the individuals of the\r\n  other, shall be paid, or the payment may be prosecuted, in the same\r\n  manner as if there had been no misunderstanding between the two States.\r\n  But this clause shall not extend to indemnities claimed on account of\r\n  captures or confiscations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this convention being submitted to the Senate of the United States,\r\nthey consented and advised to its ratification with the following\r\nproviso:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, That the second article be expunged, and that the following\r\n  article be added or inserted: It is agreed that the present convention\r\n  shall be in force for the term of eight years from the time of the\r\n  exchange of ratifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spirit and purpose of this change are apparent and unmistakable.\r\nThe convention as signed by the respective plenipotentiaries did not\r\nadjust all the points of controversy. Both nations, however, desired the\r\nrestoration of peace. Accordingly, as to those matters in the relations\r\nof the two countries concerning which they could agree, they did agree\r\nfor the time being; and as to the rest, concerning which they could not\r\nagree, they suspended and postponed further negotiation.\r\n\r\nThey abandoned no pretensions, they relinquished no right on either\r\nside, but simply adjourned the question until \"a convenient time.\"\r\nMeanwhile, and until the arrival of such convenient time, the relations\r\nof the two countries were to be regulated by the stipulations of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nOf course the convention was on its face a temporary and provisional\r\none, but in the worst possible form of prospective termination. It was\r\nto cease at a convenient time. But how should that convenient time be\r\nascertained? It is plain that such a stipulation, while professedly not\r\ndisposing of the present controversy, had within itself the germ of a\r\nfresh one, for the two Governments might at any moment fall into dispute\r\non the question whether that convenient time had or had not arrived.\r\nThe Senate of the United States anticipated and prevented this question\r\nby the only possible expedient; that is, the designation of a precise\r\ndate. This being done, the remaining parts of the second article became\r\nsuperfluous and useless, for as all the provisions of the convention\r\nwould expire in eight years, it would necessarily follow that\r\nnegotiations must be renewed within that period, more especially as the\r\noperation of the amendment which covered the whole convention was that\r\neven the stipulation of peace in the first article became temporary and\r\nexpired in eight years, whereas that article, and that article alone,\r\nwas permanent according to the original tenor of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe convention thus amended, being submitted to the First Consul, was\r\nratified by him, his act of acceptance being accompanied with the\r\nfollowing declaratory note:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Government of the United States having added in its ratification\r\n  that the convention should be in force for the space of eight years, and\r\n  having omitted the second article, the Government of the French Republic\r\n  consents to accept, ratify, and confirm the above convention with the\r\n  addition importing that the convention shall be in force for the space\r\n  of eight years and with the retrenchment of the second article:\r\n  _Provided_, That by this retrenchment the two States renounce the\r\n  respective pretensions which are the object of the said article.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe convention, as thus ratified by the First Consul, having been again\r\nsubmitted to the Senate of the United States, that body resolved that\r\n\"they considered the convention as fully ratified,\" and returned the\r\nsame to the President for promulgation, and it was accordingly\r\npromulgated in the usual form by President Jefferson.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that in simply resolving that \"they considered the\r\nconvention as fully ratified\" the Senate did in fact abstain from any\r\nexpress declaration of dissent or assent to the construction put by the\r\nFirst Consul on the retrenchment of the second article. If any inference\r\nbeyond this can be drawn from their resolution, it is that they regarded\r\nthe proviso annexed by the First Consul to his declaration of acceptance\r\nas foreign to the subject, as nugatory, or as without consequence or\r\neffect. Notwithstanding this proviso, they considered the ratification\r\nas full. If the new proviso made any change in the previous import of\r\nthe convention, then it was not full; and in considering it a full\r\nratification they in substance deny that the proviso did in any respect\r\nchange the tenor of the convention.\r\n\r\nBy the second article, as it originally stood, neither Republic had\r\nrelinquished its existing rights or pretensions, either as to other\r\nprevious treaties or the indemnities mutually due or claimed, but\r\nonly deferred the consideration of them to a convenient time. By the\r\namendment of the Senate of the United States that convenient time,\r\ninstead of being left indefinite, was fixed at eight years; but no\r\nright or pretension of either party was surrendered or abandoned.\r\n\r\nIf the Senate erred in assuming that the proviso added by the First\r\nConsul did not affect the question, then the transaction would amount\r\nto nothing more than to have raised a new question, to be disposed of\r\non resuming the negotiations, namely, the question whether the proviso\r\nof the First Consul did or not modify or impair the effect of the\r\nconvention as it had been ratified by the Senate.\r\n\r\nThat such, and such only, was the true meaning and effect of the\r\ntransaction; that it was not, and was not intended to be, a\r\nrelinquishment by the United States of any existing claim on France, and\r\nespecially that it was not an abandonment of any claims of individual\r\ncitizens, nor the set off of these against any conceded national\r\nobligations to France, is shown by the fact that President Jefferson did\r\nat once resume and prosecute to successful conclusion negotiations to\r\nobtain from France indemnification for the claims of citizens of the\r\nUnited States existing at the date of that convention; for on the 30th\r\nof April, 1803, three treaties were concluded at Paris between the\r\nUnited States of America and the French Republic, one of which embraced\r\nthe cession of Louisiana; another stipulated for the payment of\r\n60,000,000 francs by the United States to France; and a third provided\r\nthat, for the satisfaction of sums due by France to citizens of the\r\nUnited States at the conclusion of the convention of September 30, 1800,\r\nand in express compliance with the second and fifth articles thereof,\r\na further sum of 20,000,000 francs should be appropriated and paid by\r\nthe United States. In the preamble to the first of these treaties, which\r\nceded Louisiana, it is set forth that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The President of the United States of America and the First Consul of\r\n  the French Republic, in the name of the French people, desiring to\r\n  remove all source of misunderstanding relative to objects of discussion\r\n  mentioned in the second and fifth articles of the convention of the 8th\r\n  Vendémiaire, an 9 (30th September, 1800), relative to the rights claimed\r\n  by the United States in virtue of the treaty concluded at Madrid the\r\n  27th of October, 1795, between His Catholic Majesty and the said United\r\n  States, and willing to strengthen the union and friendship which at the\r\n  time of the said convention was happily reestablished between the two\r\n  nations, have respectively named their plenipotentiaries, ... who ...\r\n  have agreed to the following articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the most distinct and categorical declaration of the two\r\nGovernments that the matters of claim in the second article of the\r\nconvention of 1800 had not been ceded away, relinquished, or set off,\r\nbut they were still subsisting subjects of demand against France. The\r\nsame declaration appears in equally emphatic language in the third of\r\nthese treaties, bearing the same date, the preamble of which recites\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The President of the United States of America and the First Consul of\r\n  the French Republic, in the name of the French people, having by a\r\n  treaty of this date terminated all difficulties relative to Louisiana\r\n  and established on a solid foundation the friendship which unites the\r\n  two nations, and being desirous, in compliance with the second and fifth\r\n  articles of the convention of the 8th Vendémiaire, ninth year of the\r\n  French Republic (30th September, 1800), to secure the payment of the\r\n  sums due by France to the citizens of the United States, have appointed\r\n  plenipotentiaries--\r\n\r\n\r\nwho agreed to the following among other articles:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ART. I. The debts due by France to citizens of the United States,\r\n  contracted before the 8th of Vendémiaire, ninth year of the French\r\n  Republic (30th September, 1800), shall be paid according to the\r\n  following regulations, with interest at 6 per cent, to commence from\r\n  the periods when the accounts and vouchers were presented to the\r\n  French Government.\r\n\r\n  ART. II. The debts provided for by the preceding article are those whose\r\n  result is comprised in the conjectural note annexed to the present\r\n  convention, and which, with the interest, can not exceed the sum of\r\n  20,000,000 francs. The claims comprised in the said note which fall\r\n  within the exceptions of the following articles shall not be admitted\r\n  to the benefit of this provision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ART. IV. It is expressly agreed that the preceding articles shall\r\n  comprehend no debts but such as are due to citizens of the United States\r\n  who have been and are yet creditors of France for supplies, for\r\n  embargoes, and prizes made at sea in which the appeal has been properly\r\n  lodged within the time mentioned in the said convention, 8th\r\n  Vendémiaire, ninth year (30th September, 1800).\r\n\r\n  ART. V. The preceding articles shall apply only, first, to captures of\r\n  which the council of prizes shall have ordered restitution, it being\r\n  well understood that the claimant can not have recourse to the United\r\n  States otherwise than he might have had to the Government of the French\r\n  Republic, and only in case of insufficiency of the captors; second, the\r\n  debts mentioned in the said fifth article of the convention, contracted\r\n  before the 8th Vendémiaire, an 9 (30th September, 1800), the payment of\r\n  which has been heretofore claimed of the actual Government of France\r\n  and for which the creditors have a right to the protection of the\r\n  United States; the said fifth article does not comprehend prizes whose\r\n  condemnation has been or shall be confirmed. It is the express intention\r\n  of the contracting parties not to extend the benefit of the present\r\n  convention to reclamations of American citizens who shall have\r\n  established houses of commerce in France, England, or other countries\r\n  than the United States, in partnership with foreigners, and who by\r\n  that reason and the nature of their commerce ought to be regarded as\r\n  domiciliated in the places where such houses exist. All agreements and\r\n  bargains concerning merchandise which shall not be the property of\r\n  American citizens are equally excepted from the benefit of the said\r\n  convention, saving, however, to such persons their claims in like manner\r\n  as if this treaty had not been made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ART. XII. In case of claims for debts contracted by the Government of\r\n  France with citizens of the United States since the 8th Vendémiaire,\r\n  ninth year (30th September, 1800), not being comprised in this\r\n  convention, may be pursued, and the payment demanded in the same manner\r\n  as if it had not been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther articles of the treaty provide for the appointment of agents to\r\nliquidate the claims intended to be secured, and for the payment of them\r\nas allowed at the Treasury of the United States. The following is the\r\nconcluding clause of the tenth article:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The rejection of any claim shall have no other effect than to exempt\r\n  the United States from the payment of it, the French Government\r\n  reserving to itself the right to decide definitively on such claim so\r\n  far as it concerns itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, from the provisions of the treaties thus collated the following\r\ndeductions undeniably follow, namely:\r\n\r\nFirst. Neither the second article of the convention of 1800, as it\r\noriginally stood, nor the retrenchment of that article, nor the proviso\r\nin the ratification by the First Consul, nor the action of the Senate of\r\nthe United States thereon, was regarded by either France or the United\r\nStates as the renouncement of any claims of American citizens against\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nSecond. On the contrary, in the treaties of 1803 the two Governments\r\ntook up the question precisely where it was left on the day of the\r\nsignature of that of 1800, without suggestion on the part of France that\r\nthe claims of our citizens were excluded by the retrenchment of the\r\nsecond article or the note of the First Consul, and proceeded to make\r\nample provision for such as France could be induced to admit were justly\r\ndue, and they were accordingly discharged in full, with interest, by the\r\nUnited States in the stead and behalf of France.\r\n\r\nThird. The United States, not having admitted in the convention of\r\n1800 that they were under any obligations to France by reason of the\r\nabrogation of the treaties of 1778 and 1788, persevered in this view of\r\nthe question by the tenor of the treaties of 1803, and therefore had no\r\nsuch national obligation to discharge, and did not, either in purpose\r\nor in fact, at any time undertake to discharge themselves from any such\r\nobligation at the expense and with the property of individual citizens\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nFourth. By the treaties of 1803 the United States obtained from France\r\nthe acknowledgment and payment, as part of the indemnity for the cession\r\nof Louisiana, of claims of citizens of the United States for spoliations,\r\nso far as France would admit her liability in the premises; but even then\r\nthe United States did not relinquish any claim of American citizens not\r\nprovided for by those treaties; so far from it, to the honor of France be\r\nit remembered, she expressly reserved to herself the right to reconsider\r\nany rejected claims of citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nFifth. As to claims of citizens of the United States against France,\r\nwhich had been the subject of controversy between the two countries\r\nprior to the signature of the convention of 1800, and the further\r\nconsideration of which was reserved for a more convenient time by the\r\nsecond article of that convention, for these claims, and these only,\r\nprovision was made in the treaties of 1803, all other claims being\r\nexpressly excluded by them from their scope and purview.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be overlooked, though not necessary to the conclusion,\r\nthat by the convention between France and the United States of the\r\n4th of July, 1831, complete provision was made for the liquidation,\r\ndischarge, and payment on both sides of all claims of citizens of either\r\nagainst the other for unlawful seizures, captures, sequestrations, or\r\ndestructions of the vessels, cargoes, or other property, without any\r\nlimitation of time, so as in terms to run back to the date of the\r\nlast preceding settlement, at least to that of 1803, if not to the\r\ncommencement of our national relations with France.\r\n\r\nThis review of the successive treaties between France and the United\r\nStates has brought my mind to the undoubting conviction that while\r\nthe United States have in the most ample and the completest manner\r\ndischarged their duty toward such of their citizens as may have been at\r\nany time aggrieved by acts of the French Government, so also France has\r\nhonorably discharged herself of all obligations in the premises toward\r\nthe United States. To concede what this bill assumes would be to impute\r\nundeserved reproach both to France and to the United States.\r\n\r\nI am, of course, aware that the bill proposes only to provide\r\nindemnification for such valid claims of citizens of the United States\r\nagainst France as shall not have been stipulated for and embraced in\r\nany of the treaties enumerated. But in excluding all such claims it\r\nexcludes all, in fact, for which, during the negotiations, France could\r\nbe persuaded to agree that she was in any wise liable to the United\r\nStates or our citizens. What remains? And for what is five millions\r\nappropriated? In view of what has been said there would seem to be no\r\nground on which to raise a liability of the United States, unless it be\r\nthe assumption that the United States are to be considered the insurer\r\nand the guarantor of all claims, of whatever nature, which any\r\nindividual citizen may have against a foreign nation.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3_, [_1855_.]\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith to the House of Representatives, in which it\r\noriginated, the bill entitled \"An act making appropriations for\r\nthe transportation of the United States mail, by ocean steamers and\r\notherwise, during the fiscal years ending the 30th of June, 1855, and\r\nthe 30th of June, 1856,\" with a brief statement of the reasons which\r\nprevent its receiving my approval. The bill provides, among other\r\nthings, that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The following sums be, and the same are hereby, appropriated, to be\r\n  paid out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for\r\n  the year ending the 30th of June, 1856:\r\n\r\n  For transportation of the mails from New York to Liverpool and back,\r\n  $858,000; and that the proviso contained in the first section of the\r\n  act entitled \"An act to supply deficiencies in the appropriations for\r\n  the service of the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1852,\" approved\r\n  the 21st of July, 1852, be, and the same is hereby, repealed:\r\n  _Provided_, That Edward K. Collins and his associates shall proceed\r\n  with all due diligence to build another steamship, in accordance with\r\n  the terms of their contract, and have the same ready for the mail\r\n  service in two years from and after the passage of this act; and if the\r\n  said steamship is not ready within the time above mentioned, by reason\r\n  of any neglect or want of diligence on their part, then the said Edward\r\n  K. Collins and his associates shall carry the United States mails\r\n  between New York and Liverpool from the expiration of the said two\r\n  years, every fortnight, free of any charge to the Government, until the\r\n  new steamship shall have commenced the said mail service.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original contract was predicated upon the proposition of E.K.\r\nCollins of March 6, 1846, made with abundant means of knowledge as to\r\nthe advantages and disadvantages of the terms which he then submitted\r\nfor the acceptance of the Government. The proposition was in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, _March 6, 1846_.\r\n\r\n  E.K. Collins and his associates propose to carry the United States mail\r\n  between New York and Liverpool twice each month during eight months of\r\n  the year and once a month during the other four months for the sum of\r\n  $385,000 per annum, payable quarterly. For this purpose they will agree\r\n  to build five steamships of not less than 2,000 tons measurement and of\r\n  1,000 horsepower each, which vessels shall be built for great speed and\r\n  sufficiently strong for war purposes.\r\n\r\n  Four of said vessels to be ready for service in eighteen months from\r\n  the signing of the contract. The fifth vessel to be built as early as\r\n  possibly practicable, and when not employed in the mail service to be\r\n  subject to the orders of the Government for carrying dispatches, for\r\n  which service a fair compensation is to be paid. Contract to be for\r\n  the term of ten years. It is also proposed to secure to the United\r\n  States the privilege of purchasing said steamships whenever they\r\n  may be required for public purposes, at a fair valuation, to be\r\n  ascertained by appraisers appointed by the United States and by the\r\n  owners.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD K. COLLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act of March 3, 1847, provides--\r\n\r\n\r\n  That from and immediately after the passage of this act it shall\r\n  be the duty of the Secretary of the Navy to accept, on the part of\r\n  the Government of the United States, the proposals of E.K. Collins\r\n  and his associates, of the city of New York, submitted to the\r\n  Postmaster-General, and dated at Washington, March 6, 1846, for\r\n  the transportation of the United States mail between New York and\r\n  Liverpool, and to contract with the said E.K. Collins and his\r\n  associates for the faithful fulfillment of the stipulations therein\r\n  contained, and in accordance with the provisions of this act.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd under this proposition and enactment the original contract was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of that contract the parties were to receive from\r\nthe United States for twenty round trips each year the sum of $19,250\r\nthe trip, or $385,000 per annum; and they were to construct and provide\r\nfive ships of a stipulated size and quality for the performance of this\r\nor other service for the Government.\r\n\r\nOf the ships contracted for, only four have been furnished--the\r\n_Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic_, and _Baltic_--and the present bill proposes\r\nto dispense entirely with the original condition of a fifth ship, by\r\nonly requiring the construction of one, which would but supply the\r\nplace of the _Arctic_, recently lost by peril of the sea. Certain minor\r\nconditions involving expense to the contractors, among which was one\r\nfor the accommodation and subsistence of a certain number of passed\r\nmidshipmen on each vessel, had previously been dispensed with on the\r\npart of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy act of Congress of July 21, 1852, the amount of compensation to\r\nthe contractors was increased from $19,250 to $33,000 a trip and the\r\nnumber of trips from twenty to twenty-six each year, making the whole\r\ncompensation $858,000 per annum. During the period of time from the\r\ncommencement of the service of these contractors, on the 27th of April,\r\n1850, to the end of the last fiscal year, June 30, 1854, the sum paid\r\nto them by the United States amounted to $2,620,906, without reckoning\r\npublic money advanced on loan to aid them in the construction of the\r\nships; while the whole amount of postages derived to the Department has\r\nbeen only $734,056, showing an excess of expenditure above receipts of\r\n$1,886,440 to the charge of the Government. In the meantime, in addition\r\nto the payments from the Treasury, the parties have been in the\r\nenjoyment of large receipts from the transportation of passengers and\r\nmerchandise, the profits of which are in addition to the amount allowed\r\nby the United States.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the liberal conditions heretofore enjoyed by\r\nthe parties were less than a proper compensation for the service to be\r\nperformed, including whatever there may have been of hazard in a new\r\nundertaking, nor that any hardship can be justly alleged calling for\r\nrelief on the part of the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the construction of five ships of great speed,\r\nand sufficiently strong for war purposes, and the services of passed\r\nmidshipmen on board of them, so as thus to augment the contingent force\r\nand the actual efficiency of the Navy, were among the inducements of the\r\nGovernment to enter into the contract.\r\n\r\nThe act of July 21, 1852, provides \"that it shall be in the power of\r\nCongress at any time after the 31st day of December, 1854, to terminate\r\nthe arrangement for the additional allowance herein provided for upon\r\ngiving six months' notice;\" and it will be seen that, with the exception\r\nof the six additional trips required by the act of July 21, 1852, there\r\nhas been no departure from the original engagement but to relieve\r\nthe contractors from obligation, and yet by the act last named the\r\ncompensation was increased from $385,000 to $858,000, with no other\r\nprotection to the public interests provided than the right which\r\nCongress reserved to itself to terminate the contract, so far as this\r\nincreased compensation was concerned, after six months' notice. This\r\nlast provision, certainly a primary consideration for the more generous\r\naction of the Government, the present bill proposes to repeal, so as to\r\nleave Congress no power to terminate the new arrangement.\r\n\r\nTo this repeal the objections are, in my mind, insuperable, because in\r\nterms it deprives the United States of all future discretion as to the\r\nincreased service and compensation, whatever changes may occur in the\r\nart of navigation, its expenses, or the policy and political condition\r\nof the country. The gravity of this objection is enhanced by other\r\nconsiderations. While the contractors are to be paid a compensation\r\nnearly double the rate of the original contract, they are exempted from\r\nseveral of its conditions, which has the effect of adding still more to\r\nthat rate; while the further advantage is conceded to them of placing\r\ntheir new privileges beyond the control even of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt will be regarded as a less serious objection than that already\r\nstated, but one which should not be overlooked, that the privileges\r\nbestowed upon the contractors are without corresponding advantages to\r\nthe Government, which receives no sufficient pecuniary or other return\r\nfor the immense outlay involved, which could obtain the same service of\r\nother parties at less cost, and which, if the bill becomes a law, will\r\npay them a large amount of public money without adequate consideration;\r\nthat is, will in effect confer a gratuity whilst nominally making\r\nprovision for the transportation of the mails of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo provide for making a donation of such magnitude and to give to the\r\narrangement the character of permanence which this bill proposes would\r\nbe to deprive commercial enterprise of the benefits of free competition\r\nand to establish a monopoly in violation of the soundest principles of\r\npublic policy and of doubtful compatibility with the Constitution.\r\n\r\nI am, of course, not unmindful of the fact that the bill comprises\r\nvarious other appropriations which are more or less important to the\r\npublic interests, for which reason my objections to it are communicated\r\nat the first meeting of the House following its presentation to me, in\r\nthe hope that by amendment to bills now pending or otherwise suitable\r\nprovision for all the objects in question may be made before the\r\nadjournment of Congress.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States approved the\r\n5th day of August, 1854, entitled \"An act to carry into effect a\r\ntreaty between the United States and Great Britain signed on the 5th\r\nday of June, 1854,\" it is provided that whenever the President of the\r\nUnited States shall receive satisfactory evidence that the Imperial\r\nParliament of Great Britain and the Provincial Parliaments of Canada,\r\nNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edwards Island have passed laws\r\non their part to give full effect to the provisions of the said treaty,\r\nhe is authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that he has such\r\nevidence; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory information has been received by me that the\r\nImperial Parliament of Great Britain and the Provincial Parliaments\r\nof Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edwards Island have\r\npassed laws on their part to give full effect to the provisions of the\r\ntreaty aforesaid:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Franklin Pierce, President of the United States\r\nof America, do hereby declare and proclaim that from this date the\r\nfollowing articles, being the growth and produce of the said Provinces\r\nof Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edwards Island, to\r\nwit: Grain, flour, and breadstuffs of all kinds; animals of all kinds;\r\nfresh, smoked, and salted meats; cotton wool, seeds and vegetables,\r\nundried fruits, dried fruits, fish of all kinds, products of fish and\r\nall other creatures living in the water, poultry, eggs; hides, furs,\r\nskins, or tails, undressed; stone or marble in its crude or unwrought\r\nstate, slate, butter, cheese, tallow, lard, horns, manures, ores of\r\nmetals of all kinds, coal, pitch, tar, turpentine, ashes; timber and\r\nlumber of all kinds, round, hewed, and sawed, unmanufactured in whole\r\nor in part; firewood; plants, shrubs, and trees; pelts, wool, fish oil,\r\nrice, broom corn, and bark; gypsum, ground or unground; hewn or wrought\r\nor unwrought burr or grind stones; dyestuffs; flax, hemp, and tow,\r\nunmanufactured; unmanufactured tobacco, rags--shall be introduced into\r\nthe United States free of duty so long as the said treaty shall remain\r\nin force, subject, however, to be suspended in relation to the trade\r\nwith Canada on the condition mentioned in the fourth article of the said\r\ntreaty, and that all the other provisions of the said treaty shall go\r\ninto effect and be observed on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, the 16th day of March,\r\nA.D. 1855, and of the Independence of the United States the\r\nseventy-ninth.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W.L.

I have deferred to this usage until the close of the first\r\nmonth of the session, but my convictions of duty will not permit me\r\nlonger to postpone the discharge of the obligation enjoined by the\r\nConstitution upon the President \"to give to the Congress information of\r\nthe state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such\r\nmeasures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\"\r\n\r\nIt is matter of congratulation that the Republic is tranquilly advancing\r\nin a career of prosperity and peace.\r\n\r\nWhilst relations of amity continue to exist between the United States\r\nand all foreign powers, with some of them grave questions are depending\r\nwhich may require the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nOf such questions, the most important is that which has arisen out of\r\nthe negotiations with Great Britain in reference to Central America.\r\n\r\nBy the convention concluded between the two Governments on the 19th of\r\nApril, 1850, both parties covenanted that \"neither will ever\" \"occupy,\r\nor fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion over\r\nNicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast, or any part of Central\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the undoubted understanding of the United States in making this\r\ntreaty that all the present States of the former Republic of Central\r\nAmerica and the entire territory of each would thenceforth enjoy\r\ncomplete independence, and that both contracting parties engaged equally\r\nand to the same extent, for the present and for the future, that if\r\neither then had any claim of right in Central America such claim and all\r\noccupation or authority under it were unreservedly relinquished by the\r\nstipulations of the convention, and that no dominion was thereafter to\r\nbe exercised or assumed in any part of Central America by Great Britain\r\nor the United States.\r\n\r\nThis Government consented to restrictions in regard to a region of\r\ncountry wherein we had specific and peculiar interests only upon the\r\nconviction that the like restrictions were in the same sense obligatory\r\non Great Britain. But for this understanding of the force and effect of\r\nthe convention it would never have been concluded by us.\r\n\r\nSo clear was this understanding on the part of the United States that in\r\ncorrespondence contemporaneous with the ratification of the convention\r\nit was distinctly expressed that the mutual covenants of nonoccupation\r\nwere not intended to apply to the British establishment at the Balize.\r\nThis qualification is to be ascribed to the fact that, in virtue of\r\nsuccessive treaties with previous sovereigns of the country, Great\r\nBritain had obtained a concession of the right to cut mahogany or\r\ndye-woods at the Balize, but with positive exclusion of all domain\r\nor sovereignty; and thus it confirms the natural construction and\r\nunderstood import of the treaty as to all the rest of the region\r\nto which the stipulations applied.\r\n\r\nIt, however, became apparent at an early day after entering upon the\r\ndischarge of my present functions that Great Britain still continued in\r\nthe exercise or assertion of large authority in all that part of Central\r\nAmerica commonly called the Mosquito Coast, and covering the entire\r\nlength of the State of Nicaragua and a part of Costa Rica; that she\r\nregarded the Balize as her absolute domain and was gradually extending\r\nits limits at the expense of the State of Honduras, and that she had\r\nformally colonized a considerable insular group known as the Bay\r\nIslands, and belonging of right to that State.\r\n\r\nAll these acts or pretensions of Great Britain, being contrary to the\r\nrights of the States of Central America and to the manifest tenor of her\r\nstipulations with the United States as understood by this Government,\r\nhave been made the subject of negotiation through the American minister\r\nin London. I transmit herewith the instructions to him on the subject\r\nand the correspondence between him and the British secretary for foreign\r\naffairs, by which you will perceive that the two Governments differ\r\nwidely and irreconcilably as to the construction of the convention and\r\nits effect on their respective relations to Central America.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain so construes the convention as to maintain unchanged all\r\nher previous pretensions over the Mosquito Coast and in different parts\r\nof Central America. These pretensions as to the Mosquito Coast are\r\nfounded on the assumption of political relation between Great Britain\r\nand the remnant of a tribe of Indians on that coast, entered into at a\r\ntime when the whole country was a colonial possession of Spain. It can\r\nnot be successfully controverted that by the public law of Europe and\r\nAmerica no possible act of such Indians or their predecessors could\r\nconfer on Great Britain any political rights.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain does not allege the assent of Spain as the origin of her\r\nclaims on the Mosquito Coast. She has, on the contrary, by repeated and\r\nsuccessive treaties renounced and relinquished all pretensions of her\r\nown and recognized the full and sovereign rights of Spain in the most\r\nunequivocal terms. Yet these pretensions, so without solid foundation\r\nin the beginning and thus repeatedly abjured, were at a recent period\r\nrevived by Great Britain against the Central American States, the\r\nlegitimate successors to all the ancient jurisdiction of Spain in that\r\nregion. They were first applied only to a defined part of the coast of\r\nNicaragua, afterwards to the whole of its Atlantic coast, and lastly to\r\na part of the coast of Costa Rica, and they are now reasserted to this\r\nextent notwithstanding engagements to the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica the interference of\r\nGreat Britain, though exerted at one time in the form of military\r\noccupation of the port of San Juan del Norte, then in the peaceful\r\npossession of the appropriate authorities of the Central American\r\nStates, is now presented by her as the rightful exercise of a\r\nprotectorship over the Mosquito tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nBut the establishment at the Balize, now reaching far beyond its\r\ntreaty limits into the State of Honduras, and that of the Bay Islands,\r\nappertaining of right to the same State, are as distinctly colonial\r\ngovernments as those of Jamaica or Canada, and therefore contrary to the\r\nvery letter, as well as the spirit, of the convention with the United\r\nStates as it was at the time of ratification and now is understood by\r\nthis Government.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation which the British Government thus, in assertion\r\nand act, persists in ascribing to the convention entirely changes\r\nits character. While it holds us to all our obligations, it in a\r\ngreat measure releases Great Britain from those which constituted the\r\nconsideration of this Government for entering into the convention. It\r\nis impossible, in my judgment, for the United States to acquiesce in\r\nsuch a construction of the respective relations of the two Governments\r\nto Central America.\r\n\r\nTo a renewed call by this Government upon Great Britain to abide by and\r\ncarry into effect the stipulations of the convention according to its\r\nobvious import by withdrawing from the possession or colonization of\r\nportions of the Central American States of Honduras, Nicaragua, and\r\nCosta Rica, the British Government has at length replied, affirming that\r\nthe operation of the treaty is prospective only and did not require\r\nGreat Britain to abandon or contract any possessions held by her in\r\nCentral America at the date of its conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis reply substitutes a partial issue in the place of the general one\r\npresented by the United States. The British Government passes over the\r\nquestion of the rights of Great Britain, real or supposed, in Central\r\nAmerica, and assumes that she had such rights at the date of the treaty\r\nand that those rights comprehended the protectorship of the Mosquito\r\nIndians, the extended jurisdiction and limits of the Balize, and the\r\ncolony of the Bay Islands, and thereupon proceeds by implication to\r\ninfer that if the stipulations of the treaty be merely future in effect\r\nGreat Britain may still continue to hold the contested portions of\r\nCentral America. The United States can not admit either the inference\r\nor the premises. We steadily deny that at the date of the treaty Great\r\nBritain had any possessions there other than the limited and peculiar\r\nestablishment at the Balize, and maintain that if she had any they were\r\nsurrendered by the convention.\r\n\r\nThis Government, recognizing the obligations of the treaty, has, of\r\ncourse, desired to see it executed in good faith by both parties, and\r\nin the discussion, therefore, has not looked to rights which we might\r\nassert independently of the treaty in consideration of our geographical\r\nposition and of other circumstances which create for us relations to the\r\nCentral American States different from those of any government of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, in its last communication, although well knowing\r\nthe views of the United States, still declares that it sees no reason\r\nwhy a conciliatory spirit may not enable the two Governments to overcome\r\nall obstacles to a satisfactory adjustment of the subject.\r\n\r\nAssured of the correctness of the construction of the treaty constantly\r\nadhered to by this Government and resolved to insist on the rights\r\nof the United States, yet actuated also by the same desire which is\r\navowed by the British Government, to remove all causes of serious\r\nmisunderstanding between two nations associated by so many ties of\r\ninterest and kindred, it has appeared to me proper not to consider\r\nan amicable solution of the controversy hopeless.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, reason to apprehend that with Great Britain in the\r\nactual occupation of the disputed territories, and the treaty therefore\r\npractically null so far as regards our rights, this international\r\ndifficulty can not long remain undetermined without involving in serious\r\ndanger the friendly relations which it is the interest as well as the\r\nduty of both countries to cherish and preserve. It will afford me\r\nsincere gratification if future efforts shall result in the success\r\nanticipated heretofore with more confidence than the aspect of the case\r\npermits me now to entertain.\r\n\r\nOne other subject of discussion between the United States and Great\r\nBritain has grown out of the attempt, which the exigencies of the war in\r\nwhich she is engaged with Russia induced her to make, to draw recruits\r\nfrom the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is the traditional and settled policy of the United States to\r\nmaintain impartial neutrality during the wars which from time to time\r\noccur among the great powers of the world. Performing all the duties of\r\nneutrality toward the respective belligerent states, we may reasonably\r\nexpect them not to interfere with our lawful enjoyment of its benefits.\r\nNotwithstanding the existence of such hostilities, our citizens retained\r\nthe individual right to continue all their accustomed pursuits, by land\r\nor by sea, at home or abroad, subject only to such restrictions in this\r\nrelation as the laws of war, the usage of nations, or special treaties\r\nmay impose; and it is our sovereign right that our territory and\r\njurisdiction shall not be invaded by either of the belligerent parties\r\nfor the transit of their armies, the operations of their fleets, the\r\nlevy of troops for their service, the fitting out of cruisers by or\r\nagainst either, or any other act or incident of war. And these\r\nundeniable rights of neutrality, individual and national, the United\r\nStates will under no circumstances surrender.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this policy, the laws of the United States do not\r\nforbid their citizens to sell to either of the belligerent powers\r\narticles contraband of war or take munitions of war or soldiers on\r\nboard their private ships for transportation; and although in so doing\r\nthe individual citizen exposes his property or person to some of the\r\nhazards of war, his acts do not involve any breach of national neutrality\r\nnor of themselves implicate the Government. Thus, during the progress\r\nof the present war in Europe, our citizens have, without national\r\nresponsibility therefor, sold gunpowder and arms to all buyers,\r\nregardless of the destination of those articles. Our merchantmen have\r\nbeen, and still continue to be, largely employed by Great Britain and by\r\nFrance in transporting troops, provisions, and munitions of war to the\r\nprincipal seat of military operations and in bringing home their sick\r\nand wounded soldiers; but such use of our mercantile marine is not\r\ninterdicted either by the international or by our municipal law, and\r\ntherefore does not compromit our neutral relations with Russia.\r\n\r\nBut our municipal law, in accordance with the law of nations,\r\nperemptorily forbids not only foreigners, but our own citizens, to fit\r\nout within the United States a vessel to commit hostilities against any\r\nstate with which the United States are at peace, or to increase the\r\nforce of any foreign armed vessel intended for such hostilities against\r\na friendly state.\r\n\r\nWhatever concern may have been felt by either of the belligerent powers\r\nlest private armed cruisers or other vessels in the service of one might\r\nbe fitted out in the ports of this country to depredate on the property\r\nof the other, all such fears have proved to be utterly groundless. Our\r\ncitizens have been withheld from any such act or purpose by good faith\r\nand by respect for the law.\r\n\r\nWhile the laws of the Union are thus peremptory in their prohibition of\r\nthe equipment or armament of belligerent cruisers in our ports, they\r\nprovide not less absolutely that no person shall, within the territory\r\nor jurisdiction of the United States, enlist or enter himself, or hire\r\nor retain another person to enlist or enter himself, or to go beyond the\r\nlimits or jurisdiction of the United States with intent to be enlisted\r\nor entered, in the service of any foreign state, either as a soldier or\r\nas a marine or seaman on board of any vessel of war, letter of marque,\r\nor privateer. And these enactments are also in strict conformity with\r\nthe law of nations, which declares that no state has the right to raise\r\ntroops for land or sea service in another state without its consent, and\r\nthat, whether forbidden by the municipal law or not, the very attempt to\r\ndo it without such consent is an attack on the national sovereignty.\r\n\r\nSuch being the public rights and the municipal law of the United States,\r\nno solicitude on the subject was entertained by this Government when,\r\na year since, the British Parliament passed an act to provide for the\r\nenlistment of foreigners in the military service of Great Britain.\r\nNothing on the face of the act or in its public history indicated that\r\nthe British Government proposed to attempt recruitment in the United\r\nStates, nor did it ever give intimation of such intention to this\r\nGovernment. It was matter of surprise, therefore, to find subsequently\r\nthat the engagement of persons within the United States to proceed to\r\nHalifax, in the British Province of Nova Scotia, and there enlist in the\r\nservice of Great Britain, was going on extensively, with little or no\r\ndisguise. Ordinary legal steps were immediately taken to arrest and\r\npunish parties concerned, and so put an end to acts infringing the\r\nmunicipal law and derogatory to our sovereignty. Meanwhile suitable\r\nrepresentations on the subject were addressed to the British Government.\r\n\r\nThereupon it became known, by the admission of the British Government\r\nitself, that the attempt to draw recruits from this country originated\r\nwith it, or at least had its approval and sanction; but it also appeared\r\nthat the public agents engaged in it had \"stringent instructions\" not to\r\nviolate the municipal law of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how it should have been supposed that\r\ntroops could be raised here by Great Britain without violation of the\r\nmunicipal law. The unmistakable object of the law was to prevent every\r\nsuch act which if performed must be either in violation of the law or in\r\nstudied evasion of it, and in either alternative the act done would be\r\nalike injurious to the sovereignty of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the matter acquired additional importance by the\r\nrecruitments in the United States not being discontinued, and the\r\ndisclosure of the fact that they were prosecuted upon a systematic plan\r\ndevised by official authority; that recruiting rendezvous had been\r\nopened in our principal cities and depots for the reception of recruits\r\nestablished on our frontier, and the whole business conducted under the\r\nsupervision and by the regular cooperation of British officers, civil\r\nand military, some in the North American Provinces and some in the\r\nUnited States. The complicity of those officers in an undertaking which\r\ncould only be accomplished by defying our laws, throwing suspicion over\r\nour attitude of neutrality, and disregarding our territorial rights is\r\nconclusively proved by the evidence elicited on the trial of such of\r\ntheir agents as have been apprehended and convicted. Some of the\r\nofficers thus implicated are of high official position, and many of them\r\nbeyond our jurisdiction, so that legal proceedings could not reach the\r\nsource of the mischief.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, and the fact that the cause of complaint was not a\r\nmere casual occurrence, but a deliberate design, entered upon with full\r\nknowledge of our laws and national policy and conducted by responsible\r\npublic functionaries, impelled me to present the case to the British\r\nGovernment, in order to secure not only a cessation of the wrong, but\r\nits reparation. The subject is still under discussion, the result of\r\nwhich will be communicated to you in due time.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation submitted to the last Congress, that\r\nprovision be made for the appointment of a commissioner, in connection\r\nwith Great Britain, to survey and establish the boundary line which\r\ndivides the Territory of Washington from the contiguous British\r\npossessions. By reason of the extent and importance of the country\r\nin dispute, there has been imminent danger of collision between the\r\nsubjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States,\r\nincluding their respective authorities, in that quarter. The prospect of\r\na speedy arrangement has contributed hitherto to induce on both sides\r\nforbearance to assert by force what each claims as a right. Continuance\r\nof delay on the part of the two Governments to act in the matter will\r\nincrease the dangers and difficulties of the controversy.\r\n\r\nMisunderstanding exists as to the extent, character, and value of the\r\npossessory rights of the Hudsons Bay Company and the property of the\r\nPugets Sound Agricultural Company reserved in our treaty with Great\r\nBritain relative to the Territory of Oregon. I have reason to believe\r\nthat a cession of the rights of both companies to the United States,\r\nwhich would be the readiest means of terminating all questions, can be\r\nobtained on reasonable terms, and with a view to this end I present the\r\nsubject to the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Newfoundland, having enacted the laws required by the\r\ntreaty of the 5th of June, 1854, is now placed on the same footing in\r\nrespect to commercial intercourse with the United States as the other\r\nBritish North American Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe commission which that treaty contemplated, for determining the\r\nrights of fishery in rivers and mouths of rivers on the coasts of\r\nthe United States and the British North American Provinces, has been\r\norganized, and has commenced its labors, to complete which there are\r\nneeded further appropriations for the service of another season.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the authority conferred by a resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe United States passed on the 3d of March last, notice was given to\r\nDenmark on the 14th day of April of the intention of this Government\r\nto avail itself of the stipulation of the subsisting convention of\r\nfriendship, commerce, and navigation between that Kingdom and the United\r\nStates whereby either party might after ten years terminate the same at\r\nthe expiration of one year from the date of notice for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which led me to call the attention of Congress to\r\nthat convention and induced the Senate to adopt the resolution referred\r\nto still continue in full force. The convention contains an article\r\nwhich, although it does not directly engage the United States to submit\r\nto the imposition of tolls on the vessels and cargoes of Americans\r\npassing into or from the Baltic Sea during the continuance of the\r\ntreaty, yet may by possibility be construed as implying such submission.\r\nThe exaction of those tolls not being justified by any principle of\r\ninternational law, it became the right and duty of the United States to\r\nrelieve themselves from the implication of engagement on the subject,\r\nso as to be perfectly free to act in the premises in such way as their\r\npublic interests and honor shall demand.\r\n\r\nI remain of the opinion that the United States ought not to submit to\r\nthe payment of the Sound dues, not so much because of their amount,\r\nwhich is a secondary matter, but because it is in effect the recognition\r\nof the right of Denmark to treat one of the great maritime highways of\r\nnations as a close sea, and prevent the navigation of it as a privilege,\r\nfor which tribute may be imposed upon those who have occasion to use it.\r\n\r\nThis Government on a former occasion, not unlike the present, signalized\r\nits determination to maintain the freedom of the seas and of the great\r\nnatural channels of navigation. The Barbary States had for a long time\r\ncoerced the payment of tribute from all nations whose ships frequented\r\nthe Mediterranean. To the last demand of such payment made by them the\r\nUnited States, although suffering less by their depredations than many\r\nother nations, returned the explicit answer that we preferred war to\r\ntribute, and thus opened the way to the relief of the commerce of the\r\nworld from an ignominious tax, so long submitted to by the more powerful\r\nnations of Europe.\r\n\r\nIf the manner of payment of the Sound dues differ from that of the\r\ntribute formerly conceded to the Barbary States, still their exaction\r\nby Denmark has no better foundation in right. Each was in its origin\r\nnothing but a tax on a common natural right, extorted by those who were\r\nat that time able to obstruct the free and secure enjoyment of it, but\r\nwho no longer possess that power.\r\n\r\nDenmark, while resisting our assertion of the freedom of the Baltic\r\nSound and Belts, has indicated a readiness to make some new arrangement\r\non the subject, and has invited the governments interested, including\r\nthe United States, to be represented in a convention to assemble for the\r\npurpose of receiving and considering a proposition which she intends to\r\nsubmit for the capitalization of the Sound dues and the distribution of\r\nthe sum to be paid as commutation among the governments according to\r\nthe respective proportions of their maritime commerce to and from the\r\nBaltic. I have declined, in behalf of the United States, to accept this\r\ninvitation, for the most cogent reasons. One is that Denmark does not\r\noffer to submit to the convention the question of her right to levy the\r\nSound dues. The second is that if the convention were allowed to take\r\ncognizance of that particular question, still it would not be competent\r\nto deal with the great international principle involved, which affects\r\nthe right in other cases of navigation and commercial freedom, as well\r\nas that of access to the Baltic. Above all, by the express terms of the\r\nproposition it is contemplated that the consideration of the Sound dues\r\nshall be commingled with and made subordinate to a matter wholly\r\nextraneous--the balance of power among the Governments of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, rejecting this proposition and insisting on the right\r\nof free transit into and from the Baltic, I have expressed to Denmark\r\na willingness on the part of the United States to share liberally with\r\nother powers in compensating her for any advantages which commerce shall\r\nhereafter derive from expenditures made by her for the improvement and\r\nsafety of the navigation of the Sound or Belts.\r\n\r\nI lay before you herewith sundry documents on the subject, in which my\r\nviews are more fully disclosed. Should no satisfactory arrangement be\r\nsoon concluded, I shall again call your attention to the subject, with\r\nrecommendation of such measures as may appear to be required in order to\r\nassert and secure the rights of the United States, so far as they are\r\naffected by the pretensions of Denmark.\r\n\r\nI announce with much gratification that since the adjournment of the\r\nlast Congress the question then existing between this Government and\r\nthat of France respecting the French consul at San Francisco has been\r\nsatisfactorily determined, and that the relations of the two Governments\r\ncontinue to be of the most friendly nature.\r\n\r\nA question, also, which has been pending for several years between\r\nthe United States and the Kingdom of Greece, growing out of the\r\nsequestration by public authorities of that country of property\r\nbelonging to the present American consul at Athens, and which had been\r\nthe subject of very earnest discussion heretofore, has recently been\r\nsettled to the satisfaction of the party interested and of both\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nWith Spain peaceful relations are still maintained, and some progress\r\nhas been made in securing the redress of wrongs complained of by this\r\nGovernment. Spain has not only disavowed and disapproved the conduct\r\nof the officers who illegally seized and detained the steamer _Black\r\nWarrior_ at Havana, but has also paid the sum claimed as indemnity for\r\nthe loss thereby inflicted on citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a destructive hurricane which visited Cuba in 1844,\r\nthe supreme authority of that island issued a decree permitting the\r\nimportation for the period of six months of certain building materials\r\nand provisions free of duty, but revoked it when about half the period\r\nonly had elapsed, to the injury of citizens of the United States who had\r\nproceeded to act on the faith of that decree. The Spanish Government\r\nrefused indemnification to the parties aggrieved until recently, when it\r\nwas assented to, payment being promised to be made so soon as the amount\r\ndue can be ascertained.\r\n\r\nSatisfaction claimed for the arrest and search of the steamer _El\r\nDorado_ has not yet been accorded, but there is reason to believe that\r\nit will be; and that case, with others, continues to be urged on the\r\nattention of the Spanish Government. I do not abandon the hope of\r\nconcluding with Spain some general arrangement which, if it do not\r\nwholly prevent the recurrence of difficulties in Cuba, will render them\r\nless frequent, and, whenever they shall occur, facilitate their more\r\nspeedy settlement.\r\n\r\nThe interposition of this Government has been invoked by many of its\r\ncitizens on account of injuries done to their persons and property for\r\nwhich the Mexican Republic is responsible. The unhappy situation of that\r\ncountry for some time past has not allowed its Government to give due\r\nconsideration to claims of private reparation, and has appeared to\r\ncall for and justify some forbearance in such matters on the part\r\nof this Government. But if the revolutionary movements which have\r\nlately occurred in that Republic end in the organization of a stable\r\ngovernment, urgent appeals to its justice will then be made, and, it\r\nmay be hoped, with success, for the redress of all complaints of our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the American Republics, which from their proximity and\r\nother considerations have peculiar relations to this Government, while\r\nit has been my constant aim strictly to observe all the obligations of\r\npolitical friendship and of good neighborhood, obstacles to this have\r\narisen in some of them from their own insufficient power to check\r\nlawless irruptions, which in effect throws most of the task on the\r\nUnited States. Thus it is that the distracted internal condition of the\r\nState of Nicaragua has made it incumbent on me to appeal to the good\r\nfaith of our citizens to abstain from unlawful intervention in its\r\naffairs and to adopt preventive measures to the same end, which on a\r\nsimilar occasion had the best results in reassuring the peace of the\r\nMexican States of Sonora and Lower California.\r\n\r\nSince the last session of Congress a treaty of amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation and for the surrender of fugitive criminals with the Kingdom\r\nof the Two Sicilies; a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation\r\nwith Nicaragua, and a convention of commercial reciprocity with the\r\nHawaiian Kingdom have been negotiated. The latter Kingdom and the\r\nState of Nicaragua have also acceded to a declaration recognizing as\r\ninternational rights the principles contained in the convention between\r\nthe United States and Russia of July 22, 1854. These treaties and\r\nconventions will be laid before the Senate for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe statements made in my last annual message respecting the anticipated\r\nreceipts and expenditures of the Treasury have been substantially\r\nverified.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that the\r\nreceipts during the last fiscal year, ending June 30, 1855, from all\r\nsources were $65,003,930, and that the public expenditures for the same\r\nperiod, exclusive of payments on account of the public debt, amounted to\r\n$56,365,393. During the same period the payments made in redemption of\r\nthe public debt, including interest and premium, amounted to $9,844,528.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury at the beginning of the present fiscal year,\r\nJuly 1, 1855, was $18,931,976; the receipts for the first quarter and\r\nthe estimated receipts for the remaining three quarters amount together\r\nto $67,918,734; thus affording in all, as the available resources of the\r\ncurrent fiscal year, the sum of $86,856,710.\r\n\r\nIf to the actual expenditures of the first quarter of the current\r\nfiscal year be added the probable expenditures for the remaining three\r\nquarters, as estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury, the sum total\r\nwill be $71,226,846, thereby leaving an estimated balance in the\r\nTreasury on July 1, 1856, of $15,623,863.41.\r\n\r\nIn the above-estimated expenditures of the present fiscal year are\r\nincluded $3,000,000 to meet the last installment of the ten millions\r\nprovided for in the late treaty with Mexico and $7,750,000 appropriated\r\non account of the debt due to Texas, which two sums make an aggregate\r\namount of $10,750,000 and reduce the expenditures, actual or estimated,\r\nfor ordinary objects of the year to the sum of $60,476,000.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt at the commencement of the present fiscal\r\nyear was $40,583,631, and, deduction being made of subsequent payments,\r\nthe whole public debt of the Federal Government remaining at this time\r\nis less than $40,000,000. The remnant of certain other Government\r\nstocks, amounting to $243,000, referred to in my last message as\r\noutstanding, has since been paid.\r\n\r\nI am fully persuaded that it would be difficult to devise a system\r\nsuperior to that by which the fiscal business of the Government is\r\nnow conducted. Notwithstanding the great number of public agents of\r\ncollection and disbursement, it is believed that the checks and guards\r\nprovided, including the requirement of monthly returns, render it\r\nscarcely possible for any considerable fraud on the part of those agents\r\nor neglect involving hazard of serious public loss to escape detection.\r\nI renew, however, the recommendation heretofore made by me of the\r\nenactment of a law declaring it felony on the part of public officers\r\nto insert false entries in their books of record or account or to make\r\nfalse returns, and also requiring them on the termination of their\r\nservice to deliver to their successors all books, records, and other\r\nobjects of a public nature in their custody.\r\n\r\nDerived, as our public revenue is, in chief part from duties on imports,\r\nits magnitude affords gratifying evidence of the prosperity, not only of\r\nour commerce, but of the other great interests upon which that depends.\r\n\r\nThe principle that all moneys not required for the current expenses of\r\nthe Government should remain for active employment in the hands of the\r\npeople and the conspicuous fact that the annual revenue from all sources\r\nexceeds by many millions of dollars the amount needed for a prudent and\r\neconomical administration of public affairs can not fail to suggest the\r\npropriety of an early revision and reduction of the tariff of duties on\r\nimports. It is now so generally conceded that the purpose of revenue\r\nalone can justify the imposition of duties on imports that in\r\nreadjusting the impost tables and schedules, which unquestionably\r\nrequire essential modifications, a departure from the principles of the\r\npresent tariff is not anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe Army during the past year has been actively engaged in defending the\r\nIndian frontier, the state of the service permitting but few and small\r\ngarrisons in our permanent fortifications. The additional regiments\r\nauthorized at the last session of Congress have been recruited and\r\norganized, and a large portion of the troops have already been sent to\r\nthe field. All the duties which devolve on the military establishment\r\nhave been satisfactorily performed, and the dangers and privations\r\nincident to the character of the service required of our troops have\r\nfurnished additional evidence of their courage, zeal, and capacity to\r\nmeet any requisition which their country may make upon them. For the\r\ndetails of the military operations, the distribution of the troops, and\r\nadditional provisions required for the military service, I refer to the\r\nreport of the Secretary of War and the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nExperience gathered from events which have transpired since my last\r\nannual message has but served to confirm the opinion then expressed of\r\nthe propriety of making provision by a retired list for disabled\r\nofficers and for increased compensation to the officers retained on the\r\nlist for active duty. All the reasons which existed when these measures\r\nwere recommended on former occasions continue without modification,\r\nexcept so far as circumstances have given to some of them additional\r\nforce. The recommendations heretofore made for a partial reorganization\r\nof the Army are also renewed. The thorough elementary education given\r\nto those officers who commence their service with the grade of cadet\r\nqualifies them to a considerable extent to perform the duties of every\r\narm of the service; but to give the highest efficiency to artillery\r\nrequires the practice and special study of many years, and it is not,\r\ntherefore, believed to be advisable to maintain in time of peace a\r\nlarger force of that arm than can be usually employed in the duties\r\nappertaining to the service of field and siege artillery. The duties of\r\nthe staff in all its various branches belong to the movements of troops,\r\nand the efficiency of an army in the field would materially depend upon\r\nthe ability with which those duties are discharged. It is not, as in\r\nthe case of the artillery, a specialty, but requires also an intimate\r\nknowledge of the duties of an officer of the line, and it is not doubted\r\nthat to complete the education of an officer for either the line or the\r\ngeneral staff it is desirable that he shall have served in both. With\r\nthis view, it was recommended on a former occasion that the duties of\r\nthe staff should be mainly performed by details from the line, and, with\r\nconviction of the advantages which would result from such a change,\r\nit is again presented for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy, herewith submitted, exhibits in\r\nfull the naval operations of the past year, together with the present\r\ncondition of the service, and it makes suggestions of further\r\nlegislation, to which your attention is invited.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the six steam frigates for which appropriations were\r\nmade by the last Congress has proceeded in the most satisfactory manner\r\nand with such expedition as to warrant the belief that they will be\r\nready for service early in the coming spring. Important as this addition\r\nto our naval force is, it still remains inadequate to the contingent\r\nexigencies of the protection of the extensive seacoast and vast\r\ncommercial interests of the United States. In view of this fact and of\r\nthe acknowledged wisdom of the policy of a gradual and systematic\r\nincrease of the Navy an appropriation is recommended for the\r\nconstruction of six steam sloops of war.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the steps taken in execution of the act of Congress to\r\npromote the efficiency of the Navy, it is unnecessary for me to say more\r\nthan to express entire concurrence in the observations on that subject\r\npresented by the Secretary in his report.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived by the report of the Postmaster-General that\r\nthe gross expenditure of the Department for the last fiscal year was\r\n$9,968,342 and the gross receipts $7,342,136, making an excess of\r\nexpenditure over receipts of $2,626,206; and that the cost of mail\r\ntransportation during that year was $674,952 greater than the previous\r\nyear. Much of the heavy expenditures to which the Treasury is thus\r\nsubjected is to be ascribed to the large quantity of printed matter\r\nconveyed by the mails, either franked or liable to no postage by law or\r\nto very low rates of postage compared with that charged on letters, and\r\nto the great cost of mail service on railroads and by ocean steamers.\r\nThe suggestions of the Postmaster-General on the subject deserve the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior will engage your attention\r\nas well for useful suggestions it contains as for the interest and\r\nimportance of the subjects to which they refer.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate amount of public land sold during the last fiscal year,\r\nlocated with military scrip or land warrants, taken up under grants for\r\nroads, and selected as swamp lands by States is 24,557,409 acres, of\r\nwhich the portion sold was 15,729,524 acres, yielding in receipts the\r\nsum of $11,485,380. In the same period of time 8,723,854 acres have been\r\nsurveyed, but, in consideration of the quantity already subject to\r\nentry, no additional tracts have been brought into market.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar relation of the General Government to the District of\r\nColumbia renders it proper to commend to your care not only its material\r\nbut also its moral interests, including education, more especially in\r\nthose parts of the District outside of the cities of Washington and\r\nGeorgetown.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed to revise and codify the laws of the\r\nDistrict have made such progress in the performance of their task as to\r\ninsure its completion in the time prescribed by the act of Congress.\r\n\r\nInformation has recently been received that the peace of the settlements\r\nin the Territories of Oregon and Washington is disturbed by hostilities\r\non the part of the Indians, with indications of extensive combinations\r\nof a hostile character among the tribes in that quarter, the more\r\nserious in their possible effect by reason of the undetermined foreign\r\ninterests existing in those Territories, to which your attention has\r\nalready been especially invited. Efficient measures have been taken,\r\nwhich, it is believed, will restore quiet and afford protection to our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Kansas there have been acts prejudicial to good\r\norder, but as yet none have occurred under circumstances to justify the\r\ninterposition of the Federal Executive. That could only be in case of\r\nobstruction to Federal law or of organized resistance to Territorial\r\nlaw, assuming the character of insurrection, which, if it should occur,\r\nit would be my duty promptly to overcome and suppress. I cherish the\r\nhope, however, that the occurrence of any such untoward event will be\r\nprevented by the sound sense of the people of the Territory, who by its\r\norganic law, possessing the right to determine their own domestic\r\ninstitutions, are entitled while deporting themselves peacefully to the\r\nfree exercise of that right, and must be protected in the enjoyment of\r\nit without interference on the part of the citizens of any of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary line of this Territory has never been surveyed and\r\nestablished. The rapidly extending settlements in that region and the\r\nfact that the main route between Independence, in the State of Missouri,\r\nand New Mexico is contiguous in this line suggest the probability that\r\nembarrassing questions of jurisdiction may consequently arise. For these\r\nand other considerations I commend the subject to your early attention.\r\n\r\nI have thus passed in review the general state of the Union, including\r\nsuch particular concerns of the Federal Government, whether of domestic\r\nor foreign relation, as it appeared to me desirable and useful to bring\r\nto the special notice of Congress. Unlike the great States of Europe and\r\nAsia and many of those of America, these United States are wasting\r\ntheir strength neither in foreign war nor domestic strife. Whatever\r\nof discontent or public dissatisfaction exists is attributable to the\r\nimperfections of human nature or is incident to all governments, however\r\nperfect, which human wisdom can devise. Such subjects of political\r\nagitation as occupy the public mind consist to a great extent of\r\nexaggeration of inevitable evils, or overzeal in social improvement, or\r\nmere imagination of grievance, having but remote connection with any\r\nof the constitutional functions or duties of the Federal Government.\r\nTo whatever extent these questions exhibit a tendency menacing to the\r\nstability of the Constitution or the integrity of the Union, and no\r\nfurther, they demand the consideration of the Executive and require\r\nto be presented by him to Congress.\r\n\r\nBefore the thirteen colonies became a confederation of independent\r\nStates they were associated only by community of transatlantic origin,\r\nby geographical position, and by the mutual tie of common dependence on\r\nGreat Britain. When that tie was sundered they severally assumed the\r\npowers and rights of absolute self-government. The municipal and social\r\ninstitutions of each, its laws of property and of personal relation,\r\neven its political organization, were such only as each one chose to\r\nestablish, wholly without interference from any other. In the language\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, each State had \"full power to levy\r\nwar, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do\r\nall other acts and things which independent states may of right do.\" The\r\nseveral colonies differed in climate, in soil, in natural productions,\r\nin religion, in systems of education, in legislation, and in the forms\r\nof political administration, and they continued to differ in these\r\nrespects when they voluntarily allied themselves as States to carry\r\non the War of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe object of that war was to disenthrall the united colonies from\r\nforeign rule, which had proved to be oppressive, and to separate them\r\npermanently from the mother country. The political result was the\r\nfoundation of a Federal Republic of the free white men of the colonies,\r\nconstituted, as they were, in distinct and reciprocally independent\r\nState governments. As for the subject races, whether Indian or\r\nAfrican, the wise and brave statesmen of that day, being engaged in\r\nno extravagant scheme of social change, left them as they were, and\r\nthus preserved themselves and their posterity from the anarchy and the\r\never-recurring civil wars which have prevailed in other revolutionized\r\nEuropean colonies of America.\r\n\r\nWhen the confederated States found it convenient to modify the\r\nconditions of their association by giving to the General Government\r\ndirect access in some respects to the people of the States, instead of\r\nconfining it to action on the States as such, they proceeded to frame\r\nthe existing Constitution, adhering steadily to one guiding thought,\r\nwhich was to delegate only such power as was necessary and proper to the\r\nexecution of specific purposes, or, in other words, to retain as much as\r\npossible consistently with those purposes of the independent powers of\r\nthe individual States. For objects of common defense and security, they\r\nintrusted to the General Government certain carefully defined functions,\r\nleaving all others as the undelegated rights of the separate independent\r\nsovereignties.\r\n\r\nSuch is the constitutional theory of our Government, the practical\r\nobservance of which has carried us, and us alone among modern republics,\r\nthrough nearly three generations of time without the cost of one drop\r\nof blood shed in civil war. With freedom and concert of action, it has\r\nenabled us to contend successfully on the battlefield against foreign\r\nfoes, has elevated the feeble colonies into powerful States, and has\r\nraised our industrial productions and our commerce which transports them\r\nto the level of the richest and the greatest nations of Europe. And the\r\nadmirable adaptation of our political institutions to their objects,\r\ncombining local self-government with aggregate strength, has established\r\nthe practicability of a government like ours to cover a continent with\r\nconfederate states.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States is in effect that congress of\r\nsovereignties which good men in the Old World have sought for, but\r\ncould never attain, and which imparts to America an exemption from the\r\nmutable leagues for common action, from the wars, the mutual invasions,\r\nand vague aspirations after the balance of power which convulse from\r\ntime to time the Governments of Europe. Our cooperative action rests\r\nin the conditions of permanent confederation prescribed by the\r\nConstitution. Our balance of power is in the separate reserved rights\r\nof the States and their equal representation in the Senate. That\r\nindependent sovereignty in every one of the States, with its reserved\r\nrights of local self-government assured to each by their coequal power\r\nin the Senate, was the fundamental condition of the Constitution.\r\nWithout it the Union would never have existed. However desirous the\r\nlarger States might be to reorganize the Government so as to give\r\nto their population its proportionate weight in the common counsels,\r\nthey knew it was impossible unless they conceded to the smaller ones\r\nauthority to exercise at least a negative influence on all the measures\r\nof the Government, whether legislative or executive, through their equal\r\nrepresentation in the Senate. Indeed, the larger States themselves could\r\nnot have failed to perceive that the same power was equally necessary\r\nto them for the security of their own domestic interests against the\r\naggregate force of the General Government. In a word, the original\r\nStates went into this permanent league on the agreed premises of\r\nexerting their common strength for the defense of the whole and of\r\nall its parts, but of utterly excluding all capability of reciprocal\r\naggression. Each solemnly bound itself to all the others neither to\r\nundertake nor permit any encroachment upon or intermeddling with\r\nanother's reserved rights.\r\n\r\nWhere it was deemed expedient particular rights of the States were\r\nexpressly guaranteed by the Constitution, but in all things besides\r\nthese rights were guarded by the limitation of the powers granted and by\r\nexpress reservation of all powers not granted in the compact of union.\r\nThus the great power of taxation was limited to purposes of common\r\ndefense and general welfare, excluding objects appertaining to the local\r\nlegislation of the several States; and those purposes of general welfare\r\nand common defense were afterwards defined by specific enumeration as\r\nbeing matters only of co-relation between the States themselves or\r\nbetween them and foreign governments, which, because of their common and\r\ngeneral nature, could not be left to the separate control of each State.\r\n\r\nOf the circumstances of local condition, interest, and rights in which\r\na portion of the States, constituting one great section of the Union,\r\ndiffered from the rest and from another section, the most important was\r\nthe peculiarity of a larger relative colored population in the Southern\r\nthan in the Northern States.\r\n\r\nA population of this class, held in subjection, existed in nearly all\r\nthe States, but was more numerous and of more serious concernment in the\r\nSouth than in the North on account of natural differences of climate and\r\nproduction; and it was foreseen that, for the same reasons, while this\r\npopulation would diminish and sooner or later cease to exist in some\r\nStates, it might increase in others. The peculiar character and\r\nmagnitude of this question of local rights, not in material relations\r\nonly, but still more in social ones, caused it to enter into the special\r\nstipulations of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHence, while the General Government, as well by the enumerated powers\r\ngranted to it as by those not enumerated, and therefore refused to it,\r\nwas forbidden to touch this matter in the sense of attack or offense,\r\nit was placed under the general safeguard of the Union in the sense of\r\ndefense against either invasion or domestic violence, like all other\r\nlocal interests of the several States. Each State expressly stipulated,\r\nas well for itself as for each and all of its citizens, and every\r\ncitizen of each State became solemnly bound by his allegiance to the\r\nConstitution that any person held to service or labor in one State,\r\nescaping into another, should not, in consequence of any law or\r\nregulation thereof, be discharged from such service or labor, but should\r\nbe delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor\r\nmight be due by the laws of his State.\r\n\r\nThus and thus only, by the reciprocal guaranty of all the rights of\r\nevery State against interference on the part of another, was the present\r\nform of government established by our fathers and transmitted to us, and\r\nby no other means is it possible for it to exist. If one State ceases\r\nto respect the rights of another and obtrusively intermeddles with its\r\nlocal interests; if a portion of the States assume to impose their\r\ninstitutions on the others or refuse to fulfill their obligations to\r\nthem, we are no longer united, friendly States, but distracted, hostile\r\nones, with little capacity left of common advantage, but abundant means\r\nof reciprocal injury and mischief. Practically it is immaterial whether\r\naggressive interference between the States or deliberate refusal on the\r\npart of any one of them to comply with constitutional obligations arise\r\nfrom erroneous conviction or blind prejudice, whether it be perpetrated\r\nby direction or indirection. In either case it is full of threat and of\r\ndanger to the durability of the Union.\r\n\r\nPlaced in the office of Chief Magistrate as the executive agent of the\r\nwhole country, bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\r\nand specially enjoined by the Constitution to give information to\r\nCongress on the state of the Union, it would be palpable neglect of duty\r\non my part to pass over a subject like this, which beyond all things at\r\nthe present time vitally concerns individual and public security.\r\n\r\nIt has been matter of painful regret to see States conspicuous for their\r\nservices in founding this Republic and equally sharing its advantages\r\ndisregard their constitutional obligations to it. Although conscious\r\nof their inability to heal admitted and palpable social evils of their\r\nown, and which are completely within their jurisdiction, they engage\r\nin the offensive and hopeless undertaking of reforming the domestic\r\ninstitutions of other States, wholly beyond their control and authority.\r\nIn the vain pursuit of ends by them entirely unattainable, and which\r\nthey may not legally attempt to compass, they peril the very existence\r\nof the Constitution and all the countless benefits which it has\r\nconferred. While the people of the Southern States confine their\r\nattention to their own affairs, not presuming officiously to intermeddle\r\nwith the social institutions of the Northern States, too many of the\r\ninhabitants of the latter are permanently organized in associations to\r\ninflict injury on the former by wrongful acts, which would be cause of\r\nwar as between foreign powers and only fail to be such in our system\r\nbecause perpetrated under cover of the Union.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to present this subject as truth and the occasion require\r\nwithout noticing the reiterated but groundless allegation that the\r\nSouth has persistently asserted claims and obtained advantages in the\r\npractical administration of the General Government to the prejudice of\r\nthe North, and in which the latter has acquiesced? That is, the States\r\nwhich either promote or tolerate attacks on the rights of persons and of\r\nproperty in other States, to disguise their own injustice, pretend or\r\nimagine, and constantly aver, that they, whose constitutional rights are\r\nthus systematically assailed, are themselves the aggressors. At the\r\npresent time this imputed aggression, resting, as it does, only in the\r\nvague declamatory charges of political agitators, resolves itself into\r\nmisapprehension, or misinterpretation, of the principles and facts of\r\nthe political organization of the new Territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat is the voice of history? When the ordinance which provided for the\r\ngovernment of the territory northwest of the river Ohio and for its\r\neventual subdivision into new States was adopted in the Congress of the\r\nConfederation, it is not to be supposed that the question of future\r\nrelative power as between the States which retained and those which did\r\nnot retain a numerous colored population escaped notice or failed to\r\nbe considered. And yet the concession of that vast territory to the\r\ninterests and opinions of the Northern States, a territory now the seat\r\nof five among the largest members of the Union, was in great measure the\r\nact of the State of Virginia and of the South.\r\n\r\nWhen Louisiana was acquired by the United States, it was an acquisition\r\nnot less to the North than to the South; for while it was important to\r\nthe country at the mouth of the river Mississippi to become the emporium\r\nof the country above it, so also it was even more important to the whole\r\nUnion to have that emporium; and although the new province, by reason of\r\nits imperfect settlement, was mainly regarded as on the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nyet in fact it extended to the opposite boundaries of the United States,\r\nwith far greater breadth above than below, and was in territory, as in\r\neverything else, equally at least an accession to the Northern States.\r\nIt is mere delusion and prejudice, therefore, to speak of Louisiana as\r\nacquisition in the special interest of the South.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic and just men who participated in that act were influenced\r\nby motives far above all sectional jealousies. It was in truth the great\r\nevent which, by completing for us the possession of the Valley of the\r\nMississippi, with commercial access to the Gulf of Mexico, imparted\r\nunity and strength to the whole Confederation and attached together by\r\nindissoluble ties the East and the West, as well as the North and the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nAs to Florida, that was but the transfer by Spain to the United States\r\nof territory on the east side of the river Mississippi in exchange for\r\nlarge territory which the United States transferred to Spain on the west\r\nside of that river, as the entire diplomatic history of the transaction\r\nserves to demonstrate. Moreover, it was an acquisition demanded by the\r\ncommercial interests and the security of the whole Union.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the people of the United States had grown up to a proper\r\nconsciousness of their strength, and in a brief contest with France and\r\nin a second serious war with Great Britain they had shaken off all which\r\nremained of undue reverence for Europe, and emerged from the atmosphere\r\nof those transatlantic influences which surrounded the infant Republic,\r\nand had begun to turn their attention to the full and systematic\r\ndevelopment of the internal resources of the Union.\r\n\r\nAmong the evanescent controversies of that period the most conspicuous\r\nwas the question of regulation by Congress of the social condition of\r\nthe future States to be founded in the territory of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance for the government of the territory northwest of the river\r\nOhio had contained a provision which prohibited the use of servile labor\r\ntherein, subject to the condition of the extraditions of fugitives from\r\nservice due in any other part of the United States. Subsequently to the\r\nadoption of the Constitution this provision ceased to remain as a law,\r\nfor its operation as such was absolutely superseded by the Constitution.\r\nBut the recollection of the fact excited the zeal of social propagandism\r\nin some sections of the Confederation, and when a second State, that of\r\nMissouri, came to be formed in the territory of Louisiana proposition\r\nwas made to extend to the latter territory the restriction originally\r\napplied to the country situated between the rivers Ohio and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nMost questionable as was this proposition in all its constitutional\r\nrelations, nevertheless it received the sanction of Congress, with\r\nsome slight modifications of line, to save the existing rights of the\r\nintended new State. It was reluctantly acquiesced in by Southern States\r\nas a sacrifice to the cause of peace and of the Union, not only of the\r\nrights stipulated by the treaty of Louisiana, but of the principle\r\nof equality among the States guaranteed by the Constitution. It was\r\nreceived by the Northern States with angry and resentful condemnation\r\nand complaint, because it did not concede all which they had exactingly\r\ndemanded. Having passed through the forms of legislation, it took its\r\nplace in the statute book, standing open to repeal, like any other act\r\nof doubtful constitutionality, subject to be pronounced null and void by\r\nthe courts of law, and possessing no possible efficacy to control the\r\nrights of the States which might thereafter be organized out of any part\r\nof the original territory of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn all this, if any aggression there were, any innovation upon\r\npreexisting rights, to which portion of the Union are they justly\r\nchargeable?\r\n\r\nThis controversy passed away with the occasion, nothing surviving it\r\nsave the dormant letter of the statute.\r\n\r\nBut long afterwards, when by the proposed accession of the Republic of\r\nTexas the United States were to take their next step in territorial\r\ngreatness, a similar contingency occurred and became the occasion for\r\nsystematized attempts to intervene in the domestic affairs of one\r\nsection of the Union, in defiance of their rights as States and of the\r\nstipulations of the Constitution. These attempts assumed a practical\r\ndirection in the shape of persevering endeavors by some of the\r\nRepresentatives in both Houses of Congress to deprive the Southern\r\nStates of the supposed benefit of the provisions of the act authorizing\r\nthe organization of the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\nBut the good sense of the people and the vital force of the Constitution\r\ntriumphed over sectional prejudice and the political errors of the day,\r\nand the State of Texas returned to the Union as she was, with social\r\ninstitutions which her people had chosen for themselves and with express\r\nagreement by the reannexing act that she should be susceptible of\r\nsubdivision into a plurality of States.\r\n\r\nWhatever advantage the interests of the Southern States, as such, gained\r\nby this were far inferior in results, as they unfolded in the progress\r\nof time, to those which sprang from previous concessions made by the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nTo every thoughtful friend of the Union, to the true lovers of their\r\ncountry, to all who longed and labored for the full success of this\r\ngreat experiment of republican institutions, it was cause of gratulation\r\nthat such an opportunity had occurred to illustrate our advancing power\r\non this continent and to furnish to the world additional assurance of\r\nthe strength and stability of the Constitution. Who would wish to see\r\nFlorida still a European colony? Who would rejoice to hail Texas\r\nas a lone star instead of one in the galaxy of States? Who does not\r\nappreciate the incalculable benefits of the acquisition of Louisiana?\r\nAnd yet narrow views and sectional purposes would inevitably have\r\nexcluded them all from the Union.\r\n\r\nBut another struggle on the same point ensued when our victorious\r\narmies returned from Mexico and it devolved on Congress to provide for\r\nthe territories acquired by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The great\r\nrelations of the subject had now become distinct and clear to the\r\nperception of the public mind, which appreciated the evils of sectional\r\ncontroversy upon the question of the admission of new States. In that\r\ncrisis intense solicitude pervaded the nation. But the patriotic\r\nimpulses of the popular heart, guided by the admonitory advice of the\r\nFather of his Country, rose superior to all the difficulties of the\r\nincorporation of a new empire into the Union. In the counsels of\r\nCongress there was manifested extreme antagonism of opinion and\r\naction between some Representatives, who sought by the abusive and\r\nunconstitutional employment of the legislative powers of the Government\r\nto interfere in the condition of the inchoate States and to impose their\r\nown social theories upon the latter, and other Representatives, who\r\nrepelled the interposition of the General Government in this respect and\r\nmaintained the self-constituting rights of the States. In truth, the\r\nthing attempted was in form alone action of the General Government,\r\nwhile in reality it was the endeavor, by abuse of legislative power,\r\nto force the ideas of internal policy entertained in particular States\r\nupon allied independent States. Once more the Constitution and the\r\nUnion triumphed signally. The new territories were organized without\r\nrestrictions on the disputed point, and were thus left to judge in that\r\nparticular for themselves; and the sense of constitutional faith proved\r\nvigorous enough in Congress not only to accomplish this primary object,\r\nbut also the incidental and hardly less important one of so amending the\r\nprovisions of the statute for the extradition of fugitives, from service\r\nas to place that public duty under the safeguard of the General\r\nGovernment, and thus relieve it from obstacles raised up by the\r\nlegislation of some of the States.\r\n\r\nVain declamation regarding the provisions of law for the extradition of\r\nfugitives from service, with occasional episodes of frantic effort to\r\nobstruct their execution by riot and murder, continued for a brief time\r\nto agitate certain localities. But the true principle of leaving each\r\nState and Territory to regulate its own laws of labor according to its\r\nown sense of right and expediency had acquired fast hold of the public\r\njudgment, to such a degree that by common consent it was observed in the\r\norganization of the Territory of Washington.\r\n\r\nWhen, more recently, it became requisite to organize the Territories\r\nof Nebraska and Kansas, it was the natural and legitimate, if not the\r\ninevitable, consequence of previous events and legislation that the same\r\ngreat and sound principle which had already been applied to Utah and New\r\nMexico should be applied to them--that they should stand exempt from the\r\nrestrictions proposed in the act relative to the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions were, in the estimation of many thoughtful men, null\r\nfrom the beginning, unauthorized by the Constitution, contrary to the\r\ntreaty stipulations for the cession of Louisiana, and inconsistent with\r\nthe equality of these States.\r\n\r\nThey had been stripped of all moral authority by persistent efforts to\r\nprocure their indirect repeal through contradictory enactments. They had\r\nbeen practically abrogated by the legislation attending the organization\r\nof Utah, New Mexico, and Washington. If any vitality remained in them it\r\nwould have been taken away, in effect, by the new Territorial acts in\r\nthe form originally proposed to the Senate at the first session of the\r\nlast Congress. It was manly and ingenuous, as well as patriotic and\r\njust, to do this directly and plainly, and thus relieve the statute book\r\nof an act which might be of possible future injury, but of no possible\r\nfuture benefit; and the measure of its repeal was the final consummation\r\nand complete recognition of the principle that no portion of the United\r\nStates shall undertake through assumption of the powers of the General\r\nGovernment to dictate the social institutions of any other portion.\r\n\r\nThe scope and effect of the language of repeal were not left in doubt.\r\nIt was declared in terms to be \"the true intent and meaning of this act\r\nnot to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe measure could not be withstood upon its merits alone. It was\r\nattacked with violence on the false or delusive pretext that it\r\nconstituted a breach of faith. Never was objection more utterly\r\ndestitute of substantial justification. When before was it imagined by\r\nsensible men that a regulative or declarative statute, whether enacted\r\nten or forty years ago, is irrepealable; that an act of Congress is\r\nabove the Constitution? If, indeed, there were in the facts any cause to\r\nimpute bad faith, it would attach to those only who have never ceased,\r\nfrom the time of the enactment of the restrictive provision to the\r\npresent day, to denounce and condemn it; who have constantly refused\r\nto complete it by needful supplementary legislation; who have spared no\r\nexertion to deprive it of moral force; who have themselves again and\r\nagain attempted its repeal by the enactment of incompatible provisions,\r\nand who, by the inevitable reactionary effect of their own violence\r\non the subject, awakened the country to perception of the true\r\nconstitutional principle of leaving the matter involved to the\r\ndiscretion of the people of the respective existing or incipient States.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that this principle or any other precludes the\r\npossibility of evils in practice, disturbed, as political action is\r\nliable to be, by human passions. No form of government is exempt from\r\ninconveniences; but in this case they are the result of the abuse, and\r\nnot of the legitimate exercise, of the powers reserved or conferred in\r\nthe organization of a Territory. They are not to be charged to the great\r\nprinciple of popular sovereignty. On the contrary, they disappear before\r\nthe intelligence and patriotism of the people, exerting through the\r\nballot box their peaceful and silent but irresistible power.\r\n\r\nIf the friends of the Constitution are to have another struggle, its\r\nenemies could not present a more acceptable issue than that of a State\r\nwhose constitution clearly embraces \"a republican form of government\"\r\nbeing excluded from the Union because its domestic institutions may not\r\nin all respects comport with the ideas of what is wise and expedient\r\nentertained in some other State. Fresh from groundless imputations of\r\nbreach of faith against others, men will commence the agitation of this\r\nnew question with indubitable violation of an express compact between\r\nthe independent sovereign powers of the United States and of the\r\nRepublic of Texas, as well as of the older and equally solemn compacts\r\nwhich assure the equality of all the States.\r\n\r\nBut deplorable as would be such a violation of compact in itself and\r\nin all its direct consequences, that is the very least of the evils\r\ninvolved. When sectional agitators shall have succeeded in forcing on\r\nthis issue, can their pretensions fail to be met by counter pretensions?\r\nWill not different States be compelled, respectively, to meet extremes\r\nwith extremes? And if either extreme carry its point, what is that so\r\nfar forth but dissolution of the Union? If a new State, formed from the\r\nterritory of the United States, be absolutely excluded from admission\r\ntherein, that fact of itself constitutes the disruption of union between\r\nit and the other States. But the process of dissolution could not\r\nstop there. Would not a sectional decision producing such result by a\r\nmajority of votes, either Northern or Southern, of necessity drive out\r\nthe oppressed and aggrieved minority and place in presence of each other\r\ntwo irreconcilably hostile confederations?\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to speak thus plainly of projects the offspring of that\r\nsectional agitation now prevailing in some of the States, which are as\r\nimpracticable as they are unconstitutional, and which if persevered in\r\nmust and will end calamitously. It is either disunion and civil war\r\nor it is mere angry, idle, aimless disturbance of public peace and\r\ntranquillity. Disunion for what? If the passionate rage of fanaticism\r\nand partisan spirit did not force the fact upon our attention, it would\r\nbe difficult to believe that any considerable portion of the people of\r\nthis enlightened country could have so surrendered themselves to a\r\nfanatical devotion to the supposed interests of the relatively few\r\nAfricans in the United States as totally to abandon and disregard\r\nthe interests of the 25,000,000 Americans; to trample under foot the\r\ninjunctions of moral and constitutional obligation, and to engage in\r\nplans of vindictive hostility against those who are associated with them\r\nin the enjoyment of the common, heritage of our national institutions.\r\n\r\nNor is it hostility against their fellow-citizens of one section of the\r\nUnion alone. The interests, the honor, the duty, the peace, and the\r\nprosperity of the people of all sections are equally involved and\r\nimperiled in this question. And are patriotic men in any part of the\r\nUnion prepared on such issue thus madly to invite all the consequences\r\nof the forfeiture of their constitutional engagements? It is impossible.\r\nThe storm of frenzy and faction must inevitably dash itself in vain\r\nagainst the unshaken rock of the Constitution. I shall never doubt it.\r\nI know that the Union is stronger a thousand times than all the wild\r\nand chimerical schemes of social change which are generated one after\r\nanother in the unstable minds of visionary sophists and interested\r\nagitators. I rely confidently on the patriotism of the people, on the\r\ndignity and self-respect of the States, on the wisdom of Congress, and,\r\nabove all, on the continued gracious favor of Almighty God to maintain\r\nagainst all enemies, whether at home or abroad, the sanctity of the\r\nConstitution and the integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 26, 1855_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 17th instant,\r\nI send herewith the \"memorial of citizens of New Orleans, complaining\r\nof the irregularity of the mail service between Washington and New\r\nOrleans.\" I deem it proper also to transmit with the memorial my note\r\nof the 18th instant to the memorialists and a copy of the letter of the\r\nPostmaster-General therein referred to.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1855_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na treaty between the United States and Nicaragua, signed at Granada on\r\nthe 20th day of June, A.D. 1855.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1855_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na treaty between the United States and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\r\nand a declaration as to the construction thereof, both signed at Naples\r\non the 1st day of October last.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1855_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na treaty between the United States and His Majesty the King of the\r\nHawaiian Islands, signed in Washington the 20th day of July, A.D. 1855.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 3, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith lay before the Senate, for its constitutional action thereon,\r\nthe following-described Indian treaties, negotiated by George W.\r\nManypenny and Henry C.

Such are the\r\ngreat political rights which are solemnly declared and affirmed by\r\nthat act.\r\n\r\nBased upon this theory, the act of Congress defined for each Territory\r\nthe outlines of republican government, distributing public authority\r\namong lawfully created agents--executive, judicial, and legislative--to\r\nbe appointed either by the General Government or by the Territory.\r\nThe legislative functions were intrusted to a council and a house of\r\nrepresentatives, duly elected, and empowered to enact all the local laws\r\nwhich they might deem essential to their prosperity, happiness, and good\r\ngovernment. Acting in the same spirit, Congress also defined the persons\r\nwho were in the first instance to be considered as the people of each\r\nTerritory, enacting that every free white male inhabitant of the same\r\nabove the age of 21 years, being an actual resident thereof and\r\npossessing the qualifications hereafter described, should be entitled\r\nto vote at the first election and be eligible to any office within the\r\nTerritory, but that the qualification of voters and holding office at\r\nall subsequent elections should be such as might be prescribed by the\r\nlegislative assembly; provided, however, that the right of suffrage and\r\nof holding office should be exercised only by citizens of the United\r\nStates and those who should have declared on oath their intention to\r\nbecome such and have taken an oath to support the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the provisions of the act; and provided further, that\r\nno officer, soldier, seaman, or marine or other person in the Army or\r\nNavy of the United States or attached to troops in their service should\r\nbe allowed to vote or hold office in either Territory by reason of being\r\non service therein.\r\n\r\nSuch of the public officers of the Territories as by the provisions\r\nof the act were to be appointed by the General Government, including\r\nthe governors, were appointed and commissioned in due season, the law\r\nhaving been enacted on the 30th of May, 1854, and the commission of\r\nthe governor of the Territory of Nebraska being dated on the 2d day of\r\nAugust, 1854, and of the Territory of Kansas on the 29th day of June,\r\n1854. Among the duties imposed by the act on the governors was that of\r\ndirecting and superintending the political organization of the\r\nrespective Territories.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Kansas was required to cause a census or enumeration\r\nof the inhabitants and qualified voters of the several counties and\r\ndistricts of the Territory to be taken by such persons and in such mode\r\nas he might designate and appoint; to appoint and direct the time and\r\nplaces of holding the first elections, and the manner of conducting\r\nthem, both as to the persons to superintend such elections and the\r\nreturns thereof; to declare the number of the members of the council\r\nand the house of representatives for each county or district; to\r\ndeclare what persons might appear to be duly elected, and to appoint\r\nthe time and place of the first meeting of the legislative assembly.\r\nIn substance, the same duties were devolved on the governor of Nebraska.\r\n\r\nWhile by this act the principle of constitution for each of the\r\nTerritories was one and the same and the details of organic legislation\r\nregarding both were as nearly as could be identical, and while the\r\nTerritory of Nebraska was tranquilly and successfully organized in the\r\ndue course of law, and its first legislative assembly met on the 16th\r\nof January, 1855, the organization of Kansas was long delayed, and has\r\nbeen attended with serious difficulties and embarrassments, partly the\r\nconsequence of local maladministration and partly of the unjustifiable\r\ninterference of the inhabitants of some of the States, foreign by\r\nresidence, interests, and rights to the Territory.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the Territory of Kansas, commissioned as before stated,\r\non the 29th of June, 1854, did not reach the designated seat of his\r\ngovernment until the 7th of the ensuing October, and even then failed\r\nto make the first step in its legal organization, that of ordering the\r\ncensus or enumeration of its inhabitants, until so late a day that the\r\nelection of the members of the legislative assembly did not take place\r\nuntil the 30th of March, 1855, nor its meeting until the 2d of July,\r\n1855. So that for a year after the Territory was constituted by the act\r\nof Congress and the officers to be appointed by the Federal Executive\r\nhad been commissioned it was without a complete government, without any\r\nlegislative authority, without local law, and, of course, without the\r\nordinary guaranties of peace and public order.\r\n\r\nIn other respects the governor, instead of exercising constant vigilance\r\nand putting forth all his energies to prevent or counteract the\r\ntendencies to illegality which are prone to exist in all imperfectly\r\norganized and newly associated communities, allowed his attention to be\r\ndiverted from official obligations by other objects, and himself set\r\nan example of the violation of law in the performance of acts which\r\nrendered it my duty in the sequel to remove him from the office of chief\r\nexecutive magistrate of the Territory.\r\n\r\nBefore the requisite preparation was accomplished for election of a\r\nTerritorial legislature, an election of Delegate to Congress had been\r\nheld in the Territory on the 29th day of November, 1854, and the\r\nDelegate took his seat in the House of Representatives without\r\nchallenge. If arrangements had been perfected by the governor so that\r\nthe election for members of the legislative assembly might be held in\r\nthe several precincts at the same time as for Delegate to Congress, any\r\nquestion appertaining to the qualification of the persons voting as\r\npeople of the Territory would have passed necessarily and at once under\r\nthe supervision of Congress, as the judge of the validity of the return\r\nof the Delegate, and would have been determined before conflicting\r\npassions had become inflamed by time, and before opportunity could have\r\nbeen afforded for systematic interference of the people of individual\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis interference, in so far as concerns its primary causes and its\r\nimmediate commencement, was one of the incidents of that pernicious\r\nagitation on the subject of the condition of the colored persons held\r\nto service in some of the States which has so long disturbed the repose\r\nof our country and excited individuals, otherwise patriotic and law\r\nabiding, to toil with misdirected zeal in the attempt to propagate their\r\nsocial theories by the perversion and abuse of the powers of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe persons and the parties whom the tenor of the act to organize the\r\nTerritories of Nebraska and Kansas thwarted in the endeavor to impose,\r\nthrough the agency of Congress, their particular views of social\r\norganization on the people of the future new States now perceiving\r\nthat the policy of leaving the inhabitants of each State to judge for\r\nthemselves in this respect was ineradicably rooted in the convictions\r\nof the people of the Union, then had recourse, in the pursuit of\r\ntheir general object, to the extraordinary measure of propagandist\r\ncolonization of the Territory of Kansas to prevent the free and natural\r\naction of its inhabitants in its internal organization, and thus to\r\nanticipate or to force the determination of that question in this\r\ninchoate State.\r\n\r\nWith such views associations were organized in some of the States, and\r\ntheir purposes were proclaimed through the press in language extremely\r\nirritating and offensive to those of whom the colonists were to become\r\nthe neighbors. Those designs and acts had the necessary consequence to\r\nawaken emotions of intense indignation in States near to the Territory\r\nof Kansas, and especially in the adjoining State of Missouri, whose\r\ndomestic peace was thus the most directly endangered; but they are far\r\nfrom justifying the illegal and reprehensible countermovements which\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nUnder these inauspicious circumstances the primary elections for members\r\nof the legislative assembly were held in most, if not all, of the\r\nprecincts at the time and the places and by the persons designated and\r\nappointed by the governor according to law.\r\n\r\nAngry accusations that illegal votes had been polled abounded on all\r\nsides, and imputations were made both of fraud and violence. But the\r\ngovernor, in the exercise of the power and the discharge of the duty\r\nconferred and imposed by law on him alone, officially received and\r\nconsidered the returns, declared a large majority of the members of\r\nthe council and the house of representatives \"duly elected,\" withheld\r\ncertificates from others because of alleged illegality of votes,\r\nappointed a new election to supply the places of the persons not\r\ncertified, and thus at length, in all the forms of statute, and with\r\nhis own official authentication, complete legality was given to the\r\nfirst legislative assembly of the Territory.\r\n\r\nThose decisions of the returning officers and of the governor are final,\r\nexcept that by the parliamentary usage of the country applied to the\r\norganic law it may be conceded that each house of the assembly must have\r\nbeen competent to determine in the last resort the qualifications and\r\nthe election of its members. The subject was by its nature one\r\nappertaining exclusively to the jurisdiction of the local authorities\r\nof the Territory. Whatever irregularities may have occurred in the\r\nelections, it seems too late now to raise that question. At all events,\r\nit is a question as to which, neither now nor at any previous time, has\r\nthe least possible legal authority been possessed by the President of\r\nthe United States. For all present purposes the legislative body thus\r\nconstituted and elected was the legitimate legislative assembly of the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the governor by proclamation convened the assembly thus\r\nelected to meet at a place called Pawnee City; the two houses met and\r\nwere duly organized in the ordinary parliamentary form; each sent to and\r\nreceived from the governor the official communications usual on such\r\noccasions; an elaborate message opening the session was communicated by\r\nthe governor, and the general business of legislation was entered upon\r\nby the legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nBut after a few days the assembly resolved to adjourn to another place\r\nin the Territory. A law was accordingly passed, against the consent\r\nof the governor, but in due form otherwise, to remove the seat of\r\ngovernment temporarily to the \"Shawnee Manual Labor School\" (or\r\nmission), and thither the assembly proceeded. After this, receiving\r\na bill for the establishment of a ferry at the town of Kickapoo, the\r\ngovernor refused to sign it, and by special message assigned for reason\r\nof refusal not anything objectionable in the bill itself nor any\r\npretense of the illegality or incompetency of the assembly as such, but\r\nonly the fact that the assembly had by its act transferred the seat of\r\ngovernment temporarily from Pawnee City to the Shawnee Mission. For\r\nthe same reason he continued to refuse to sign other bills until in the\r\ncourse of a few days he by official message communicated to the assembly\r\nthe fact that he had received notification of the termination of his\r\nfunctions as governor, and that the duties of the office were legally\r\ndevolved on the secretary of the Territory; thus to the last recognizing\r\nthe body as a duly elected and constituted legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that if any constitutional defect attached to the\r\nlegislative acts of the assembly it is not pretended to consist in\r\nirregularity of election or want of qualification of the members,\r\nbut only in the change of its place of session. However trivial this\r\nobjection may seem to be, it requires to be considered, because upon it\r\nis founded all that superstructure of acts, plainly against law, which\r\nnow threaten the peace, not only of the Territory of Kansas, but of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nSuch an objection to the proceedings of the legislative assembly was\r\nof exceptionable origin, for the reason that by the express terms of\r\nthe organic law the seat of government of the Territory was \"located\r\ntemporarily at Fort Leavenworth;\" and yet the governor himself remained\r\nthere less than two months, and of his own discretion transferred the\r\nseat of government to the Shawnee Mission, where it in fact was at the\r\ntime the assembly were called to meet at Pawnee City. If the governor\r\nhad any such right to change temporarily the seat of government, still\r\nmore had the legislative assembly. The objections are of exceptionable\r\norigin for the further reason that the place indicated by the governor,\r\nwithout having any exclusive claim of preference in itself, was a\r\nproposed town site only, which he and others were attempting to\r\nlocate unlawfully upon land within a military reservation, and for\r\nparticipation in which illegal act the commandant of the post, a\r\nsuperior officer in the Army, has been dismissed by sentence of\r\ncourt-martial. Nor is it easy to see why the legislative assembly might\r\nnot with propriety pass the Territorial act transferring its sittings to\r\nthe Shawnee Mission. If it could not, that must be on account of some\r\nprohibitory or incompatible provision of act of Congress; but no such\r\nprovision exists. The organic act, as already quoted, says \"the seat\r\nof government is hereby located temporarily at Fort Leavenworth;\" and\r\nit then provides that certain of the public buildings there \"may be\r\noccupied and used under the direction of the governor and legislative\r\nassembly.\" These expressions might possibly be construed to imply that\r\nwhen, in a previous section of the act, it was enacted that \"the first\r\nlegislative assembly shall meet at such place and on such day as\r\nthe governor shall appoint,\" the word \"place\" means place at Fort\r\nLeavenworth, not place anywhere in the Territory. If so, the governor\r\nwould have been the first to err in this matter, not only in himself\r\nhaving removed the seat of government to the Shawnee Mission, but in\r\nagain removing it to Pawnee City. If there was any departure from the\r\nletter of the law, therefore, it was his in both instances. But however\r\nthis may be, it is most unreasonable to suppose that by the terms of\r\nthe organic act Congress intended to do impliedly what it has not done\r\nexpressly--that is, to forbid to the legislative assembly the power\r\nto choose any place it might see fit as the temporary seat of its\r\ndeliberations. That is proved by the significant language of one of\r\nthe subsequent acts of Congress on the subject--that of March 3,\r\n1855--which, in making appropriation for public buildings of the\r\nTerritory, enacts that the same shall not be expended \"until the\r\nlegislature of said Territory shall have fixed by law the permanent\r\nseat of government.\" Congress in these expressions does not profess\r\nto be granting the power to fix the permanent seat of government, but\r\nrecognizes the power as one already granted. But how? Undoubtedly by the\r\ncomprehensive provision of the organic act itself, which declares that\r\n\"the legislative power of the Territory shall extend to all rightful\r\nsubjects of legislation consistent with the Constitution of the United\r\nStates and the provisions of this act.\" If in view of this act the\r\nlegislative assembly had the large power to fix the permanent seat\r\nof government at any place in its discretion, of course by the same\r\nenactment it had the less and the included power to fix it temporarily.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the allegation that the acts of the legislative assembly\r\nwere illegal by reason of this removal of its place of session was\r\nbrought forward to justify the first great movement in disregard of\r\nlaw within the Territory. One of the acts of the legislative assembly\r\nprovided for the election of a Delegate to the present Congress, and a\r\nDelegate was elected under that law. But subsequently to this a portion\r\nof the people of the Territory proceeded without authority of law to\r\nelect another Delegate.\r\n\r\nFollowing upon this movement was another and more important one of the\r\nsame general character. Persons confessedly not constituting the body\r\npolitic or all the inhabitants, but merely a party of the inhabitants,\r\nand without law, have undertaken to summon a convention for the purpose\r\nof transforming the Territory into a State, and have framed a\r\nconstitution, adopted it, and under it elected a governor and other\r\nofficers and a Representative to Congress. In extenuation of these\r\nillegal acts it is alleged that the States of California, Michigan, and\r\nothers were self-organized, and as such were admitted into the Union\r\nwithout a previous enabling act of Congress. It is true that while\r\nin a majority of cases a previous act of Congress has been passed to\r\nauthorize the Territory to present itself as a State, and that this is\r\ndeemed the most regular course, yet such an act has not been held to be\r\nindispensable, and in some cases the Territory has proceeded without it,\r\nand has nevertheless been admitted into the Union as a State. It lies\r\nwith Congress to authorize beforehand or to confirm afterwards, in\r\nits discretion. But in no instance has a State been admitted upon the\r\napplication of persons acting against authorities duly constituted by\r\nact of Congress. In every case it is the people of the Territory, not\r\na party among them, who have the power to form a constitution and ask\r\nfor admission as a State. No principle of public law, no practice or\r\nprecedent under the Constitution of the United States, no rule of\r\nreason, right, or common sense, confers any such power as that now\r\nclaimed by a mere party in the Territory. In fact what has been done\r\nis of revolutionary character. It is avowedly so in motive and in aim\r\nas respects the local law of the Territory. It will become treasonable\r\ninsurrection if it reach the length of organized resistance by force to\r\nthe fundamental or any other Federal law and to the authority of the\r\nGeneral Government. In such an event the path of duty for the Executive\r\nis plain. The Constitution requiring him to take care that the laws of\r\nthe United States be faithfully executed, if they be opposed in the\r\nTerritory of Kansas he may, and should, place at the disposal of the\r\nmarshal any public force of the United States which happens to be within\r\nthe jurisdiction, to be used as a portion of the _posse comitatus_; and\r\nif that do not suffice to maintain order, then he may call forth the\r\nmilitia of one or more States for that object, or employ for the same\r\nobject any part of the land or naval force of the United States. So,\r\nalso, if the obstruction be to the laws of the Territory, and it be\r\nduly presented to him as a case of insurrection, he may employ for its\r\nsuppression the militia of any State or the land or naval force of the\r\nUnited States. And if the Territory be invaded by the citizens of other\r\nStates, whether for the purpose of deciding elections or for any other,\r\nand the local authorities find themselves unable to repel or withstand\r\nit, they will be entitled to, and upon the fact being fully ascertained\r\nthey shall most certainly receive, the aid of the General Government.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the duty of the President of the United States to\r\nvolunteer interposition by force to preserve the purity of elections\r\neither in a State or Territory. To do so would be subversive of public\r\nfreedom. And whether a law be wise or unwise, just or unjust, is not a\r\nquestion for him to judge. If it be constitutional--that is, if it be\r\nthe law of the land--it is his duty to cause it to be executed, or to\r\nsustain the authorities of any State or Territory in executing it in\r\nopposition to all insurrectionary movements.\r\n\r\nOur system affords no justification of revolutionary acts, for the\r\nconstitutional means of relieving the people of unjust administration\r\nand laws, by a change of public agents and by repeal, are ample, and\r\nmore prompt and effective than illegal violence. These means must be\r\nscrupulously guarded, this great prerogative of popular sovereignty\r\nsacredly respected.\r\n\r\nIt is the undoubted right of the peaceable and orderly people of the\r\nTerritory of Kansas to elect their own legislative body, make their\r\nown laws, and regulate their own social institutions, without foreign\r\nor domestic molestation. Interference on the one hand to procure the\r\nabolition or prohibition of slave labor in the Territory has produced\r\nmischievous interference on the other for its maintenance or\r\nintroduction. One wrong begets another. Statements entirely unfounded,\r\nor grossly exaggerated, concerning events within the Territory are\r\nsedulously diffused through remote States to feed the flame of sectional\r\nanimosity there, and the agitators there exert themselves indefatigably\r\nin return to encourage and stimulate strife within the Territory.\r\n\r\nThe inflammatory agitation, of which the present is but a part, has for\r\ntwenty years produced nothing save unmitigated evil, North and South.\r\nBut for it the character of the domestic institutions of the future new\r\nState would have been a matter of too little interest to the inhabitants\r\nof the contiguous States, personally or collectively, to produce among\r\nthem any political emotion. Climate, soil, production, hopes of rapid\r\nadvancement and the pursuit of happiness on the part of the settlers\r\nthemselves, with good wishes, but with no interference from without,\r\nwould have quietly determined the question which is at this time of such\r\ndisturbing character.\r\n\r\nBut we are constrained to turn our attention to the circumstances of\r\nembarrassment as they now exist. It is the duty of the people of Kansas\r\nto discountenance every act or purpose of resistance to its laws. Above\r\nall, the emergency appeals to the citizens of the States, and especially\r\nof those contiguous to the Territory, neither by intervention of\r\nnonresidents in elections nor by unauthorized military force to attempt\r\nto encroach upon or usurp the authority of the inhabitants of the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nNo citizen of our country should permit himself to forget that he is a\r\npart of its Government and entitled to be heard in the determination\r\nof its policy and its measures, and that therefore the highest\r\nconsiderations of personal honor and patriotism require him to maintain\r\nby whatever of power or influence he may possess the integrity of the\r\nlaws of the Republic.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these views, it will be my imperative duty to exert the\r\nwhole power of the Federal Executive to support public order in the\r\nTerritory; to vindicate its laws, whether Federal or local, against all\r\nattempts of organized resistance, and so to protect its people in the\r\nestablishment of their own institutions, undisturbed by encroachment\r\nfrom without, and in the full enjoyment of the rights of self-government\r\nassured to them by the Constitution and the organic act of Congress.\r\n\r\nAlthough serious and threatening disturbances in the Territory of\r\nKansas, announced to me by the governor in December last, were speedily\r\nquieted without the effusion of blood and in a satisfactory manner,\r\nthere is, I regret to say, reason to apprehend that disorders will\r\ncontinue to occur there, with increasing tendency to violence, until\r\nsome decisive measure be taken to dispose of the question itself which\r\nconstitutes the inducement or occasion of internal agitation and of\r\nexternal interference.\r\n\r\nThis, it seems to me, can best be accomplished by providing that when\r\nthe inhabitants of Kansas may desire it and shall be of sufficient\r\nnumber to constitute a State, a convention of delegates, duly elected by\r\nthe qualified voters, shall assemble to frame a constitution, and thus\r\nto prepare through regular and lawful means for its admission into the\r\nUnion as a State.\r\n\r\nI respectfully recommend the enactment of a law to that effect.\r\n\r\nI recommend also that a special appropriation be made to defray any\r\nexpense which may become requisite in the execution of the laws or the\r\nmaintenance of public order in the Territory of Kansas.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 25, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy the inclosed letter of the

of the act making\r\nappropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of the Government,\r\napproved March 2, 1855, which provides for the construction of the\r\narmory in this District before referred to.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 15, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith reports of the Secretary of State, the Secretary\r\nof the Navy, and the Attorney-General, in reply to a resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 24th of March last, and also to a resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives of the 8th of May instant, both having reference to\r\nthe routes of transit between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through\r\nthe Republics of New Granada and Nicaragua and to the condition of\r\naffairs in Central America.\r\n\r\nThese documents relate to questions of the highest importance and\r\ninterest to the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe narrow isthmus which connects the continents of North and South\r\nAmerica, by the facilities it affords for easy transit between the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans, rendered the countries of Central America\r\nan object of special consideration to all maritime nations, which has\r\nbeen greatly augmented in modern times by the operation of changes in\r\ncommercial relations, especially those produced by the general use of\r\nsteam as a motive power by land and sea. To us, on account of its\r\ngeographical position and of our political interest as an American State\r\nof primary magnitude, that isthmus is of peculiar importance, just as\r\nthe Isthmus of Suez is, for corresponding reasons, to the maritime\r\npowers of Europe. But above all, the importance to the United States of\r\nsecuring free transit across the American isthmus has rendered it of\r\nparamount interest to us since the settlement of the Territories of\r\nOregon and Washington and the accession of California to the Union.\r\n\r\nImpelled by these considerations, the United States took steps at an\r\nearly day to assure suitable means of commercial transit by canal\r\nrailway, or otherwise across this isthmus.\r\n\r\nWe concluded, in the first place, a treaty of peace, amity, navigation,\r\nand commerce with the Republic of New Granada, among the conditions of\r\nwhich was a stipulation on the part of New Granada guaranteeing to the\r\nUnited States the right of way or transit across that part of the\r\nIsthmus which lies in the territory of New Granada, in consideration of\r\nwhich the United States guaranteed in respect of the same territory the\r\nrights of sovereignty and property of New Granada.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this treaty was to afford to the people of the United\r\nStates facilities for at once opening a common road from Chagres to\r\nPanama and for at length constructing a railway in the same direction,\r\nto connect regularly with steamships, for the transportation of mails,\r\nspecie, and passengers to and fro between the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nStates and Territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe United States also endeavored, but unsuccessfully, to obtain from\r\nthe Mexican Republic the cession of the right of way at the northern\r\nextremity of the Isthmus by Tehuantepec, and that line of communication\r\ncontinues to be an object of solicitude to the people of this Republic.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, intervening between the Republic of New Granada and\r\nthe Mexican Republic lie the States of Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras,\r\nNicaragua, and Costa Rica, the several members of the former Republic of\r\nCentral America. Here, in the territory of the Central American States,\r\nis the narrowest part of the Isthmus, and hither, of course, public\r\nattention has been directed as the most inviting field for enterprises\r\nof interoceanic communication between the opposite shores of America,\r\nand more especially to the territory of the States of Nicaragua and\r\nHonduras.\r\n\r\nParamount to that of any European State, as was the interest of\r\nthe United States in the security and freedom of projected lines of\r\ntravel across the Isthmus by the way of Nicaragua and Honduras, still\r\nwe did not yield in this respect to any suggestions of territorial\r\naggrandizement, or even of exclusive advantage, either of communication\r\nor of commerce. Opportunities had not been wanting to the United States\r\nto procure such advantage by peaceful means and with full and free\r\nassent of those who alone had any legitimate authority in the matter.\r\nWe disregarded those opportunities from considerations alike of domestic\r\nand foreign policy, just as, even to the present day, we have persevered\r\nin a system of justice and respect for the rights and interests of\r\nothers as well as our own in regard to each and all of the States of\r\nCentral America.\r\n\r\nIt was with surprise and regret, therefore, that the United States\r\nlearned a few days after the conclusion of the treaty of Guadalupe\r\nHidalgo, by which the United States became, with the consent of the\r\nMexican Republic, the rightful owners of California, and thus invested\r\nwith augmented special interest in the political condition of Central\r\nAmerica, that a military expedition, under the authority of the British\r\nGovernment, had landed at San Juan del Norte, in the State of Nicaragua,\r\nand taken forcible possession of that port, the necessary terminus of\r\nany canal or railway across the Isthmus within the territories of\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nIt did not diminish the unwelcomeness to us of this act on the part of\r\nGreat Britain to find that she assumed to justify it on the ground of\r\nan alleged protectorship of a small and obscure band of uncivilized\r\nIndians, whose proper name had even become lost to history, who did not\r\nconstitute a state capable of territorial sovereignty either in fact or\r\nof right, and all political interest in whom and in the territory they\r\noccupied Great Britain had previously renounced by successive treaties\r\nwith Spain when Spain was sovereign to the country and subsequently with\r\nindependent Spanish America.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and injuriously affected as the United States conceived\r\nthemselves to have been by this act of the British Government and by its\r\noccupation about the same time of insular and of continental portions\r\nof the territory of the State of Honduras, we remembered the many and\r\npowerful ties and mutual interests by which Great Britain and the United\r\nStates are associated, and we proceeded in earnest good faith and with\r\na sincere desire to do whatever might strengthen the bonds of peace\r\nbetween us to negotiate with Great Britain a convention to assure the\r\nperfect neutrality of all interoceanic communications across the Isthmus\r\nand, as the indispensable condition of such neutrality, the absolute\r\nindependence of the States of Central America and their complete\r\nsovereignty within the limits of their own territory as well against\r\nGreat Britain as against the United States. We supposed we had\r\naccomplished that object by the convention of April 19, 1850, which\r\nwould never have been signed nor ratified on the part of the United\r\nStates but for the conviction that in virtue of its provisions neither\r\nGreat Britain nor the United States was thereafter to exercise any\r\nterritorial sovereignty in fact or in name in any part of Central\r\nAmerica, however or whensoever acquired, either before or afterwards.\r\nThe essential object of the convention--the neutralization of the\r\nIsthmus--would, of course, become a nullity if either Great Britain\r\nor the United States were to continue to hold exclusively islands or\r\nmainland of the Isthmus, and more especially if, under any claim of\r\nprotectorship of Indians, either Government were to remain forever\r\nsovereign in fact of the Atlantic shores of the three States of Costa\r\nRica, Nicaragua, and Honduras.\r\n\r\nI have already communicated to the two Houses of Congress full\r\ninformation of the protracted and hitherto fruitless efforts which the\r\nUnited States have made to arrange this international question with\r\nGreat Britain. It is referred to on the present occasion only because of\r\nits intimate connection with the special object now to be brought to the\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled political condition of some of the Spanish American\r\nRepublics has never ceased to be regarded by this Government with\r\nsolicitude and regret on their own account, while it has been the source\r\nof continual embarrassment in our public and private relations with\r\nthem. In the midst of the violent revolutions and the wars by which they\r\nare continually agitated, their public authorities are unable to afford\r\ndue protection to foreigners and to foreign interests within their\r\nterritory, or even to defend their own soil against individual\r\naggressors, foreign or domestic, the burden of the inconveniences and\r\nlosses of which therefore devolves in no inconsiderable degree upon the\r\nforeign states associated with them in close relations of geographical\r\nvicinity or of commercial intercourse.\r\n\r\nSuch is more emphatically the situation of the United States\r\nwith respect to the Republics of Mexico and of Central America.\r\nNotwithstanding, however, the relative remoteness of the European\r\nStates from America, facts of the same order have not failed to appear\r\nconspicuously in their intercourse with Spanish American Republics.\r\nGreat Britain has repeatedly been constrained to recur to measures of\r\nforce for the protection of British interests in those countries. France\r\nfound it necessary to attack the castle of San Juan de Uloa and even to\r\ndebark troops at Vera Cruz in order to obtain redress of wrongs done to\r\nFrenchmen in Mexico.\r\n\r\nWhat is memorable in this respect in the conduct and policy of the\r\nUnited States is that while it would be as easy for us to annex and\r\nabsorb new territories in America as it is for European States to do\r\nthis in Asia or Africa, and while if done by us it might be justified as\r\nwell on the alleged ground of the advantage which would accrue therefrom\r\nto the territories annexed and absorbed, yet we have abstained from\r\ndoing it, in obedience to considerations of right not less than of\r\npolicy; and that while the courageous and self-reliant spirit of our\r\npeople prompts them to hardy enterprises, and they occasionally yield to\r\nthe temptation of taking part in the troubles of countries near at hand,\r\nwhere they know how potential their influence, moral and material, must\r\nbe, the American Government has uniformly and steadily resisted all\r\nattempts of individuals in the United States to undertake armed\r\naggression against friendly Spanish American Republics.\r\n\r\nWhile the present incumbent of the executive office has been in\r\ndischarge of its duties he has never failed to exert all the authority\r\nin him vested to repress such enterprises, because they are in violation\r\nof the law of the land, which the Constitution requires him to execute\r\nfaithfully; because they are contrary to the policy of the Government,\r\nand because to permit them would be a departure from good faith toward\r\nthose American Republics in amity with us, which are entitled to, and\r\nwill never cease to enjoy, in their calamities the cordial sympathy, and\r\nin their prosperity the efficient good will, of the Government and of\r\nthe people of the United States.\r\n\r\nTo say that our laws in this respect are sometimes violated or\r\nsuccessfully evaded is only to say what is true of all laws in all\r\ncountries, but not more so in the United States than in any one whatever\r\nof the countries of Europe. Suffice it to repeat that the laws of\r\nthe United States prohibiting all foreign military enlistments or\r\nexpeditions within our territory have been executed with impartial\r\ngood faith, and, so far as the nature of things permits, as well in\r\nrepression of private persons as of the official agents of other\r\nGovernments, both of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nAmong the Central American Republics to which modern events have\r\nimparted most prominence is that of Nicaragua, by reason of its\r\nparticular position on the Isthmus. Citizens of the United States have\r\nestablished in its territory a regular interoceanic transit route,\r\nsecond only in utility and value to the one previously established in\r\nthe territory of New Granada. The condition of Nicaragua would, it is\r\nbelieved, have been much more prosperous than it has been but for the\r\noccupation of its only Atlantic port by a foreign power, and of the\r\ndisturbing authority set up and sustained by the same power in a portion\r\nof its territory, by means of which its domestic sovereignty was\r\nimpaired, its public lands were withheld from settlement, and it was\r\ndeprived of all the maritime revenue which it would otherwise collect\r\non imported merchandise at San Juan del Norte.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances of the political debility of the Republic of\r\nNicaragua, and when its inhabitants were exhausted by long-continued\r\ncivil war between parties neither of them strong enough to overcome\r\nthe other or permanently maintain internal tranquillity, one of\r\nthe contending factions of the Republic invited the assistance and\r\ncooperation of a small body of citizens of the United States from the\r\nState of California, whose presence, as it appears, put an end at once\r\nto civil war and restored apparent order throughout the territory of\r\nNicaragua, with a new administration, having at its head a distinguished\r\nindividual, by birth a citizen of the Republic, D. Patricio Rivas,\r\nas its provisional President.\r\n\r\nIt is the established policy of the United States to recognize all\r\ngovernments without question of their source or their organization, or\r\nof the means by which the governing persons attain their power, provided\r\nthere be a government _de facto_ accepted by the people of the country,\r\nand with reserve only of the time as to the recognition of revolutionary\r\ngovernments arising out of the subdivision of parent states with which\r\nwe are in relations of amity. We do not go behind the fact of a foreign\r\ngovernment exercising actual power to investigate questions of\r\nlegitimacy; we do not inquire into the causes which may have led to\r\na change of government. To us it is indifferent whether a successful\r\nrevolution has been aided by foreign intervention or not; whether\r\ninsurrection has overthrown existing government, and another has been\r\nestablished in its place according to preexisting forms or in a manner\r\nadopted for the occasion by those whom we may find in the actual\r\npossession of power. All these matters we leave to the people and\r\npublic authorities of the particular country to determine; and their\r\ndetermination, whether it be by positive action or by ascertained\r\nacquiescence, is to us a sufficient warranty of the legitimacy of\r\nthe new government.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixty-seven years which have elapsed since the establishment\r\nof the existing Government of the United States, in all which time this\r\nUnion has maintained undisturbed domestic tranquillity, we have had\r\noccasion to recognize governments _de facto_, founded either by domestic\r\nrevolution or by military invasion from abroad, in many of the\r\nGovernments of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is the more imperatively necessary to apply this rule to the\r\nSpanish American Republics, in consideration of the frequent and not\r\nseldom anomalous changes of organization or administration which they\r\nundergo and the revolutionary nature of most of these changes, of\r\nwhich the recent series of revolutions in the Mexican Republic is an\r\nexample, where five successive revolutionary governments have made\r\ntheir appearance in the course of a few months and been recognized\r\nsuccessively, each as the political power of that country, by the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, some time since, a new minister from the Republic of\r\nNicaragua presented himself, bearing the commission of President Rivas,\r\nhe must and would have been received as such, unless he was found\r\non inquiry subject to personal exception, but for the absence of\r\nsatisfactory information upon the question whether President Rivas was\r\n_in fact_ the head of an established Government of the Republic of\r\nNicaragua, doubt as to which arose not only from the circumstances of\r\nhis avowed association with armed emigrants recently from the United\r\nStates, but that the proposed minister himself was of that class of\r\npersons, and not otherwise or previously a citizen of Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nAnother minister from the Republic of Nicaragua has now presented\r\nhimself, and has been received as such, satisfactory evidence appearing\r\nthat he represents the Government _de facto_ and, so far as such exists,\r\nthe Government _de jure_ of that Republic.\r\n\r\nThat reception, while in accordance with the established policy of the\r\nUnited States, was likewise called for by the most imperative special\r\nexigencies, which require that this Government shall enter at once into\r\ndiplomatic relations with that of Nicaragua. In the first place, a\r\ndifference has occurred between the Government of President Rivas and\r\nthe Nicaragua Transit Company, which involves the necessity of inquiry\r\ninto rights of citizens of the United States, who allege that they\r\nhave been aggrieved by the acts of the former and claim protection\r\nand redress at the hands of their Government. In the second place,\r\nthe interoceanic communication by the way of Nicaragua is effectually\r\ninterrupted, and the persons and property of unoffending private\r\ncitizens of the United States in that country require the attention of\r\ntheir Government. Neither of these objects can receive due consideration\r\nwithout resumption of diplomatic intercourse with the Government of\r\nNicaragua.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, the documents communicated show that while the\r\ninteroceanic transit by the way of Nicaragua is cut off, disturbances\r\nat Panama have occurred to obstruct, temporarily at least, that by the\r\nway of New Granada, involving the sacrifice of the lives and property\r\nof citizens of the United States. A special commissioner has been\r\ndispatched to Panama to investigate the facts of this occurrence with a\r\nview particularly to the redress of parties aggrieved. But measures of\r\nanother class will be demanded for the future security of interoceanic\r\ncommunication by this as by the other routes of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to suggest a single object of interest, external\r\nor internal, more important to the United States than the maintenance\r\nof the communication, by land and sea, between the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nStates and Territories of the Union It is a material element of the\r\nnational integrity and sovereignty.\r\n\r\nI have adopted such precautionary measures and have taken such action\r\nfor the purpose of affording security to the several transit routes\r\nof Central America and to the persons and property of citizens of\r\nthe United States connected with or using the same as are within my\r\nconstitutional power and as existing circumstances have seemed to\r\ndemand. Should these measures prove inadequate to the object, that\r\nfact will be communicated to Congress with such recommendations as\r\nthe exigency of the case may indicate.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, May 16, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a report from the Secretary of the Interior,\r\ncontaining estimates of appropriations required in the fulfillment of\r\ntreaty stipulations with certain Indian tribes, and recommend that the\r\nappropriations asked for be made in the manner therein suggested.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 19, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n7th ultimo, requesting the President \"to communicate what information he\r\nmay possess in regard to citizens of the United States being engaged in\r\nthe slave trade, or in the transportation in American ships of coolies\r\nfrom China to Cuba and other countries with the intention of placing or\r\ncontinuing them in a state of slavery or servitude, and whether such\r\ntraffic is not, in his opinion, a violation of the spirit of existing\r\ntreaties, rendering those engaged in it liable to indictment for piracy;\r\nand especially that he be requested to communicate to this House the\r\nfacts and circumstances attending the shipment from China of some 500\r\ncoolies in the ship _Sea Witch_, of the city of New York, lately wrecked\r\non the coast of Cuba,\" I transmit the accompanying report of the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 20, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of and extracts from dispatches of the late minister\r\nof the United States at London, and of his correspondence with Lord\r\nClarendon which accompanied them, relative to the enlistment of soldiers\r\nfor the British army within the United States by agents of the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain.

But a careful examination of\r\nthe subject, with the aid of information officially received since my\r\nlast annual message was communicated to Congress, has convinced me that\r\nthe expenditure of the sum proposed would serve no valuable purpose as\r\ncontributing to the common defense, because all which could be effected\r\nby it would be to afford a channel of 12 feet depth and of so temporary\r\na character that unless the work was done immediately before the\r\nnecessity for its use should arise it could not be relied on for the\r\nvessels of even the small draft the passage of which it would permit.\r\n\r\nUnder existing circumstances, therefore, it can not be considered\r\nas a necessary means for the common defense, and is subject to those\r\nobjections which apply to other works designed to facilitate commerce\r\nand contribute to the convenience and local prosperity of those more\r\nimmediately concerned--an object not to be constitutionally and justly\r\nattained by the taxation of the people of the whole country.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 22, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving considered the bill, which originated in the Senate, entitled \"An\r\nact making an appropriation for deepening the channel over the flats of\r\nthe St. Marys River, in the State of Michigan,\" it is herewith returned\r\nwithout my approval.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation proposed by this bill is not, in my judgment, a\r\nnecessary means for the execution of any of the expressly granted powers\r\nof the Federal Government. The work contemplated belongs to a general\r\nclass of improvements, embracing roads, rivers, and canals, designed\r\nto afford additional facilities for intercourse and for the transit of\r\ncommerce, and no reason has been suggested to my mind for excepting\r\nit from the objections which apply to appropriations by the General\r\nGovernment for deepening the channels of rivers wherever shoals or other\r\nobstacles impede their navigation, and thus obstruct communication\r\nand impose restraints upon commerce within the States or between the\r\nStates or Territories of the Union. I therefore submit it to the\r\nreconsideration of Congress, on account of the same objections which\r\nhave been presented in my previous communications on the subject of\r\ninternal improvements.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 11, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith to the House of Representatives, in which it\r\noriginated, a bill entitled \"An act for continuing the improvement of\r\nthe Des Moines Rapids, in the Mississippi River,\" and submit it for\r\nreconsideration, because it is, in my judgment, liable to the objections\r\nto the prosecution of internal improvements by the General Government\r\nset forth at length in a communication addressed by me to the two Houses\r\nof Congress on the 30th day of December, 1854, and in other subsequent\r\nmessages upon the same subject, to which on this occasion I respectfully\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 14, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return herewith to the Senate, in which it originated, a bill entitled\r\n\"An act for the improvement of the navigation of the Patapsco River and\r\nto render the port of Baltimore accessible to the war steamers of the\r\nUnited States,\" and submit it for reconsideration, because it is, in\r\nmy judgment, liable to the objections to the prosecution of internal\r\nimprovements by the General Government set forth at length in a\r\ncommunication addressed by me to the two Houses of Congress on the\r\n30th day of December, 1854, and other subsequent messages upon the\r\nsame subject, to which on this occasion I respectfully refer.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has been received by me that sundry persons,\r\ncitizens of the United States and others resident therein, are\r\npreparing, within the jurisdiction of the same, to enlist, or enter\r\nthemselves, or to hire or retain others to participate in military\r\noperations within the State of Nicaragua:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Franklin Pierce, President of the United States, do\r\nwarn all persons against connecting themselves with any such enterprise\r\nor undertaking, as being contrary to their duty as good citizens and to\r\nthe laws of their country and threatening to the peace of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI do further admonish all persons who may depart from the United States,\r\neither singly or in numbers, organized or unorganized, for any such\r\npurpose, that they will thereby cease to be entitled to the protection\r\nof this Government.\r\n\r\nI exhort all good citizens to discountenance and prevent any such\r\ndisreputable and criminal undertaking as aforesaid, charging all\r\nofficers, civil and military, having lawful power in the premises,\r\nto exercise the same for the purpose of maintaining the authority\r\nand enforcing the laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed to these presents.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, the 8th day of December, 1855, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States the eightieth.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  W.L.

MARCY,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 21, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the failure of Congress at its recent session to make\r\nprovision for the support of the Army, it became imperatively incumbent\r\non me to exercise the power which the Constitution confers on the\r\nExecutive for extraordinary occasions, and promptly to convene the two\r\nHouses in order to afford them an opportunity of reconsidering a subject\r\nof such vital interest to the peace and welfare of the Union.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a partial authority vested by law in the Secretary\r\nof War to contract for the supply of clothing and subsistence, the Army\r\nis wholly dependent on the appropriations annually made by Congress.\r\nThe omission of Congress to act in this respect before the termination of\r\nthe fiscal year had already caused embarrassments to the service, which\r\nwere overcome only in expectation of appropriations before the close\r\nof the present month. If the requisite funds be not speedily provided,\r\nthe Executive will no longer be able to furnish the transportation,\r\nequipments, and munitions which are essential to the effectiveness of a\r\nmilitary force in the field. With no provision for the pay of troops the\r\ncontracts of enlistment would be broken and the Army must in effect be\r\ndisbanded, the consequences of which would be so disastrous as to demand\r\nall possible efforts to avert the calamity.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely that the officers and enlisted men of the Army are to\r\nbe thus deprived of the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled by\r\nstanding laws; that the construction of arms at the public armories, the\r\nrepair and construction of ordnance at the arsenals, and the manufacture\r\nof military clothing and camp equipage must be discontinued, and the\r\npersons connected with this branch of the public service thus be\r\ndeprived suddenly of the employment essential to their subsistence;\r\nnor is it merely the waste consequent on the forced abandonment of the\r\nseaboard fortifications and of the interior military posts and other\r\nestablishments, and the enormous expense of recruiting and reorganizing\r\nthe Army and again distributing it over the vast regions which it now\r\noccupies. These are evils which may, it is true, be repaired hereafter\r\nby taxes imposed on the country; but other evils are involved, which no\r\nexpenditures, however lavish, could remedy, in comparison with which\r\nlocal and personal injuries or interests sink into insignificance.\r\n\r\nA great part of the Army is situated on the remote frontier or in the\r\ndeserts and mountains of the interior. To discharge large bodies of men\r\nin such places without the means of regaining their homes, and where\r\nfew, if any, could obtain subsistence by honest industry, would be to\r\nsubject them to suffering and temptation, with disregard of justice and\r\nright most derogatory to the Government.\r\n\r\nIn the Territories of Washington and Oregon numerous bands of Indians\r\nare in arms and are waging a war of extermination against the white\r\ninhabitants; and although our troops are actively carrying on the\r\ncampaign, we have no intelligence as yet of a successful result. On the\r\nWestern plains, notwithstanding the imposing display of military force\r\nrecently made there and the chastisement inflicted on the rebellious\r\ntribes, others, far from being dismayed, have manifested hostile\r\nintentions and been guilty of outrages which, if not designed to provoke\r\na conflict, serve to show that the apprehension of it is insufficient\r\nwholly to restrain their vicious propensities. A strong force in the\r\nState of Texas has produced a temporary suspension of hostilities there,\r\nbut in New Mexico incessant activity on the part of the troops is\r\nrequired to keep in check the marauding tribes which infest that\r\nTerritory. The hostile Indians have not been removed from the State of\r\nFlorida, and the withdrawal of the troops therefrom, leaving that object\r\nunaccomplished, would be most injurious to the inhabitants and a breach\r\nof the positive engagement of the General Government.\r\n\r\nTo refuse supplies to the Army, therefore, is to compel the complete\r\ncessation of all its operations and its practical disbandment, and thus\r\nto invite hordes of predatory savages from the Western plains and the\r\nRocky Mountains to spread devastation along a frontier of more than\r\n4,000 miles in extent and to deliver up the sparse population of a vast\r\ntract of country to rapine and murder.\r\n\r\nSuch, in substance, would be the direct and immediate effects of\r\nthe refusal of Congress, for the first time in the history of the\r\nGovernment, to grant supplies for the maintenance of the Army--the\r\ninevitable waste of millions of public treasure; the infliction of\r\nextreme wrong upon all persons connected with the military establishment\r\nby service, employment, or contracts; the recall of our forces from the\r\nfield; the fearful sacrifice of life and incalculable destruction of\r\nproperty on the remote frontiers; the striking of our national flag\r\non the battlements of the fortresses which defend our maritime cities\r\nagainst foreign invasion; the violation of the public honor and good\r\nfaith, and the discredit of the United States in the eyes of the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nI confidently trust that these considerations, and others appertaining\r\nto the domestic peace of the country which can not fail to suggest\r\nthemselves to every patriotic mind, will on reflection be duly\r\nappreciated by both Houses of Congress and induce the enactment of the\r\nrequisite provisions of law for the support of the Army of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, August 21, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a letter from the Secretary of War, in relation to\r\nthe balances remaining in the Treasury from the last appropriation for\r\nthe support of the Army.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution requires that the President shall from time to time not\r\nonly recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he may\r\njudge necessary and expedient, but also that he shall give information\r\nto them of the state of the Union. To do this fully involves exposition\r\nof all matters in the actual condition of the country, domestic or\r\nforeign, which essentially concern the general welfare. While performing\r\nhis constitutional duty in this respect, the President does not speak\r\nmerely to express personal convictions, but as the executive minister of\r\nthe Government, enabled by his position and called upon by his official\r\nobligations to scan with an impartial eye the interests of the whole and\r\nof every part of the United States.\r\n\r\nOf the condition of the domestic interests of the Union--its agriculture,\r\nmines, manufactures, navigation, and commerce--it is necessary only to\r\nsay that the internal prosperity of the country, its continuous and\r\nsteady advancement in wealth and population and in private as well\r\nas public well-being, attest the wisdom of our institutions and the\r\npredominant spirit of intelligence and patriotism which, notwithstanding\r\noccasional irregularities of opinion or action resulting from popular\r\nfreedom, has distinguished and characterized the people of America.\r\n\r\nIn the brief interval between the termination of the last and the\r\ncommencement of the present session of Congress the public mind has been\r\noccupied with the care of selecting for another constitutional term the\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the persons who are of right, or contingently, to\r\npreside over the administration of the Government is under our system\r\ncommitted to the States and the people. We appeal to them, by their\r\nvoice pronounced in the forms of law, to call whomsoever they will to\r\nthe high post of Chief Magistrate.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is that as the Senators represent the respective States of\r\nthe Union and the members of the House of Representatives the several\r\nconstituencies of each State, so the President represents the aggregate\r\npopulation of the United States. Their election of him is the explicit\r\nand solemn act of the sole sovereign authority of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to misapprehend the great principles which by their\r\nrecent political action the people of the United States have sanctioned\r\nand announced.\r\n\r\nThey have asserted the constitutional equality of each and all of the\r\nStates of the Union as States; they have affirmed the constitutional\r\nequality of each and all of the citizens of the United States as\r\ncitizens, whatever their religion, wherever their birth or their\r\nresidence; they have maintained the inviolability of the constitutional\r\nrights of the different sections of the Union, and they have proclaimed\r\ntheir devoted and unalterable attachment to the Union and to the\r\nConstitution, as objects of interest superior to all subjects of local\r\nor sectional controversy, as the safeguard of the rights of all, as the\r\nspirit and the essence of the liberty, peace, and greatness of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nIn doing this they have at the same time emphatically condemned the idea\r\nof organizing in these United States mere geographical parties, of\r\nmarshaling in hostile array toward each other the different parts of the\r\ncountry, North or South, East or West.\r\n\r\nSchemes of this nature, fraught with incalculable mischief, and which\r\nthe considerate sense of the people has rejected, could have had\r\ncountenance in no part of the country had they not been disguised by\r\nsuggestions plausible in appearance, acting upon an excited state of the\r\npublic mind, induced by causes temporary in their character and, it is\r\nto be hoped, transient in their influence.\r\n\r\nPerfect liberty of association for political objects and the widest\r\nscope of discussion are the received and ordinary conditions of\r\ngovernment in our country. Our institutions, framed in the spirit\r\nof confidence in the intelligence and integrity of the people, do not\r\nforbid citizens, either individually or associated together, to attack\r\nby writing, speech, or any other methods short of physical force the\r\nConstitution and the very existence of the Union. Under the shelter\r\nof this great liberty, and protected by the laws and usages of the\r\nGovernment they assail, associations have been formed in some of the\r\nStates of individuals who, pretending to seek only to prevent the spread\r\nof the institution of slavery into the present or future inchoate States\r\nof the Union, are really inflamed with desire to change the domestic\r\ninstitutions of existing States. To accomplish their objects they\r\ndedicate themselves to the odious task of depreciating the government\r\norganization which stands in their way and of calumniating with\r\nindiscriminate invective not only the citizens of particular States with\r\nwhose laws they find fault, but all others of their fellow-citizens\r\nthroughout the country who do not participate with them in their\r\nassaults upon the Constitution, framed and adopted by our fathers, and\r\nclaiming for the privileges it has secured and the blessings it has\r\nconferred the steady support and grateful reverence of their children.\r\nThey seek an object which they well know to be a revolutionary one.\r\nThey are perfectly aware that the change in the relative condition of\r\nthe white and black races in the slaveholding States which they would\r\npromote is beyond their lawful authority; that to them it is a foreign\r\nobject; that it can not be effected by any peaceful instrumentality of\r\ntheirs; that for them and the States of which they are citizens the\r\nonly path to its accomplishment is through burning cities, and ravaged\r\nfields, and slaughtered populations, and all there is most terrible in\r\nforeign complicated with civil and servile war; and that the first step\r\nin the attempt is the forcible disruption of a country embracing in its\r\nbroad bosom a degree of liberty and an amount of individual and public\r\nprosperity to which there is no parallel in history, and substituting in\r\nits place hostile governments, driven at once and inevitably into mutual\r\ndevastation and fratricidal carnage, transforming the now peaceful and\r\nfelicitous brotherhood into a vast permanent camp of armed men like the\r\nrival monarchies of Europe and Asia. Well knowing that such, and such\r\nonly, are the means and the consequences of their plans and purposes,\r\nthey endeavor to prepare the people of the United States for civil war\r\nby doing everything in their power to deprive the Constitution and the\r\nlaws of moral authority and to undermine the fabric of the Union by\r\nappeals to passion and sectional prejudice, by indoctrinating its people\r\nwith reciprocal hatred, and by educating them to stand face to face as\r\nenemies, rather than shoulder to shoulder as friends.\r\n\r\nIt is by the agency of such unwarrantable interference, foreign and\r\ndomestic, that the minds of many otherwise good citizens have been so\r\ninflamed into the passionate condemnation of the domestic institutions\r\nof the Southern States as at length to pass insensibly to almost equally\r\npassionate hostility toward their fellow-citizens of those States, and\r\nthus finally to fall into temporary fellowship with the avowed and\r\nactive enemies of the Constitution. Ardently attached to liberty in the\r\nabstract, they do not stop to consider practically how the objects they\r\nwould attain can be accomplished, nor to reflect that, even if the evil\r\nwere as great as they deem it, they have no remedy to apply, and that it\r\ncan be only aggravated by their violence and unconstitutional action.\r\nA question which is one of the most difficult of all the problems of\r\nsocial institution, political economy, and statesmanship they treat\r\nwith unreasoning intemperance of thought and language. Extremes beget\r\nextremes. Violent attack from the North finds its inevitable consequence\r\nin the growth of a spirit of angry defiance at the South. Thus in the\r\nprogress of events we had reached that consummation, which the voice of\r\nthe people has now so pointedly rebuked, of the attempt of a portion of\r\nthe States, by a sectional organization and movement, to usurp the\r\ncontrol of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nI confidently believe that the great body of those who inconsiderately\r\ntook this fatal step are sincerely attached to the Constitution and the\r\nUnion. They would upon deliberation shrink with unaffected horror from\r\nany conscious act of disunion or civil war. But they have entered into\r\na path which leads nowhere unless it be to civil war and disunion, and\r\nwhich has no other possible outlet. They have proceeded thus far in\r\nthat direction in consequence of the successive stages of their progress\r\nhaving consisted of a series of secondary issues, each of which\r\nprofessed to be confined within constitutional and peaceful limits, but\r\nwhich attempted indirectly what few men were willing to do directly;\r\nthat is, to act aggressively against the constitutional rights of\r\nnearly one-half of the thirty-one States.\r\n\r\nIn the long series of acts of indirect aggression, the first was the\r\nstrenuous agitation by citizens of the Northern States, in Congress and\r\nout of it, of the question of negro emancipation in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe second step in this path of evil consisted of acts of the people\r\nof the Northern States, and in several instances of their governments,\r\naimed to facilitate the escape of persons held to service in the\r\nSouthern States and to prevent their extradition when reclaimed\r\naccording to law and in virtue of express provisions of the\r\nConstitution. To promote this object, legislative enactments and other\r\nmeans were adopted to take away or defeat rights which the Constitution\r\nsolemnly guaranteed. In order to nullify the then existing act of\r\nCongress concerning the extradition of fugitives from service, laws were\r\nenacted in many States forbidding their officers, under the severest\r\npenalties, to participate in the execution of any act of Congress\r\nwhatever. In this way that system of harmonious cooperation between the\r\nauthorities of the United States and of the several States, for the\r\nmaintenance of their common institutions, which existed in the early\r\nyears of the Republic was destroyed; conflicts of jurisdiction came to\r\nbe frequent, and Congress found itself compelled, for the support of\r\nthe Constitution and the vindication of its power, to authorize the\r\nappointment of new officers charged with the execution of its acts, as\r\nif they and the officers of the States were the ministers, respectively,\r\nof foreign governments in a state of mutual hostility rather than\r\nfellow-magistrates of a common country peacefully subsisting under the\r\nprotection of one well-constituted Union. Thus here also aggression was\r\nfollowed by reaction, and the attacks upon the Constitution at this\r\npoint did but serve to raise up new barriers for its defense and\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of this unhappy sectional controversy was in\r\nconnection with the organization of Territorial governments and\r\nthe admission of new States into the Union. When it was proposed to\r\nadmit the State of Maine, by separation of territory from that of\r\nMassachusetts, and the State of Missouri, formed of a portion of the\r\nterritory ceded by France to the United States, representatives in\r\nCongress objected to the admission of the latter unless with conditions\r\nsuited to particular views of public policy. The imposition of such a\r\ncondition was successfully resisted; but at the same period the question\r\nwas presented of imposing restrictions upon the residue of the territory\r\nceded by France. That question was for the time disposed of by the\r\nadoption of a geographical line of limitation.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should not be forgotten that when France, of\r\nher own accord, resolved, for considerations of the most far-sighted\r\nsagacity, to cede Louisiana to the United States, and that accession was\r\naccepted by the United States, the latter expressly engaged that \"the\r\ninhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union\r\nof the United States and admitted as soon as possible, according to the\r\nprinciples of the Federal Constitution, to the enjoyment of all the\r\nrights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the United States;\r\nand in the meantime they shall be maintained and protected in the free\r\nenjoyment of their _liberty, property_, and the religion which they\r\nprofess;\" that is to say, while it remains in a Territorial condition\r\nits inhabitants are maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of\r\ntheir liberty and property, with a right then to pass into the condition\r\nof States on a footing of perfect equality with the original States.\r\n\r\nThe enactment which established the restrictive geographical line was\r\nacquiesced in rather than approved by the States of the Union. It stood\r\non the statute book, however, for a number of years; and the people of\r\nthe respective States acquiesced in the reenactment of the principle as\r\napplied to the State of Texas, and it was proposed to acquiesce in its\r\nfurther application to the territory acquired by the United States\r\nfrom Mexico. But this proposition was successfully resisted by the\r\nrepresentatives from the Northern States, who, regardless of the statute\r\nline, insisted upon applying restriction to the new territory generally,\r\nwhether lying north or south of it, thereby repealing it as a\r\nlegislative compromise, and, on the part of the North, persistently\r\nviolating the compact, if compact there was.\r\n\r\nThereupon this enactment ceased to have binding virtue in any sense,\r\nwhether as respects the North or the South, and so in effect it was\r\ntreated on the occasion of the admission of the State of California and\r\nthe organization of the Territories of New Mexico, Utah, and Washington.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of this question when the time arrived for the\r\norganization of the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska. In the progress\r\nof constitutional inquiry and reflection it had now at length come to\r\nbe seen clearly that Congress does not possess constitutional power to\r\nimpose restrictions of this character upon any present or future State\r\nof the Union. In a long series of decisions, on the fullest argument and\r\nafter the most deliberate consideration, the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates had finally determined this point in every form under which the\r\nquestion could arise, whether as affecting public or private rights--in\r\nquestions of the public domain, of religion, of navigation, and of\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nThe several States of the Union are by force of the Constitution coequal\r\nin domestic legislative power. Congress can not change a law of domestic\r\nrelation in the State of Maine; no more can it in the State of Missouri.\r\nAny statute which proposes to do this is a mere nullity; it takes away\r\nno right, it confers none. If it remains on the statute book unrepealed,\r\nit remains there only as a monument of error and a beacon of warning to\r\nthe legislator and the statesman. To repeal it will be only to remove\r\nimperfection from the statutes, without affecting, either in the sense\r\nof permission or of prohibition, the action of the States or of their\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nStill, when the nominal restriction of this nature, already a dead\r\nletter in law, was in terms repealed by the last Congress, in a clause\r\nof the act organizing the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, that\r\nrepeal was made the occasion of a widespread and dangerous agitation.\r\n\r\nIt was alleged that the original enactment being a compact of perpetual\r\nmoral obligation, its repeal constituted an odious breach of faith.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress, while it remains unrepealed, more especially if it\r\nbe constitutionally valid in the judgment of those public functionaries\r\nwhose duty it is to pronounce on that point, is undoubtedly binding on\r\nthe conscience of each good citizen of the Republic. But in what sense\r\ncan it be asserted that the enactment in question was invested with\r\nperpetuity and entitled to the respect of a solemn compact? Between whom\r\nwas the compact? No distinct contending powers of the Government, no\r\nseparate sections of the Union treating as such, entered into treaty\r\nstipulations on the subject. It was a mere clause of an act of Congress,\r\nand, like any other controverted matter of legislation, received its\r\nfinal shape and was passed by compromise of the conflicting opinions or\r\nsentiments of the members of Congress. But if it had moral authority\r\nover men's consciences, to whom did this authority attach? Not to those\r\nof the North, who had repeatedly refused to confirm it by extension\r\nand who had zealously striven to establish other and incompatible\r\nregulations upon the subject. And if, as it thus appears, the supposed\r\ncompact had no obligatory force as to the North, of course it could not\r\nhave had any as to the South, for all such compacts must be mutual and\r\nof reciprocal obligation.\r\n\r\nIt has not unfrequently happened that lawgivers, with undue estimation\r\nof the value of the law they give or in the view of imparting to it\r\npeculiar strength, make it perpetual in terms; but they can not thus\r\nbind the conscience, the judgment, and the will of those who may succeed\r\nthem, invested with similar responsibilities and clothed with equal\r\nauthority. More careful investigation may prove the law to be unsound\r\nin principle. Experience may show it to be imperfect in detail and\r\nimpracticable in execution. And then both reason and right combine\r\nnot merely to justify but to require its repeal.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, supreme, as it is, over all the departments of the\r\nGovernment--legislative, executive, and judicial--is open to amendment\r\nby its very terms; and Congress or the States may, in their discretion,\r\npropose amendment to it, solemn compact though it in truth is between\r\nthe sovereign States of the Union. In the present instance a political\r\nenactment which had ceased to have legal power or authority of any kind\r\nwas repealed. The position assumed that Congress had no moral right to\r\nenact such repeal was strange enough, and singularly so in view of the\r\nfact that the argument came from those who openly refused obedience\r\nto existing laws of the land, having the same popular designation and\r\nquality as compromise acts; nay, more, who unequivocally disregarded\r\nand condemned the most positive and obligatory injunctions of the\r\nConstitution itself, and sought by every means within their reach to\r\ndeprive a portion of their fellow-citizens of the equal enjoyment of\r\nthose rights and privileges guaranteed alike to all by the fundamental\r\ncompact of our Union.\r\n\r\nThis argument against the repeal of the statute line in question was\r\naccompanied by another of congenial character and equally with the\r\nformer destitute of foundation in reason and truth. It was imputed that\r\nthe measure originated in the conception of extending the limits of\r\nslave labor beyond those previously assigned to it, and that such was\r\nits natural as well as intended effect; and these baseless assumptions\r\nwere made, in the Northern States, the ground of unceasing assault upon\r\nconstitutional right.\r\n\r\nThe repeal in terms of a statute, which was already obsolete and also\r\nnull for unconstitutionality, could have no influence to obstruct or\r\nto promote the propagation of conflicting views of political or social\r\ninstitution. When the act organizing the Territories of Kansas and\r\nNebraska was passed, the inherent effect upon that portion of the\r\npublic domain thus opened to legal settlement was to admit settlers\r\nfrom all the States of the Union alike, each with his convictions of\r\npublic policy and private interest, there to found, in their discretion,\r\nsubject to such limitations as the Constitution and acts of Congress\r\nmight prescribe, new States, hereafter to be admitted into the Union.\r\nIt was a free field, open alike to all, whether the statute line of\r\nassumed restriction were repealed or not. That repeal did not open to\r\nfree competition of the diverse opinions and domestic institutions a\r\nfield which without such repeal would have been closed against them;\r\nit found that field of competition already opened, in fact and in law.\r\nAll the repeal did was to relieve the statute book of an objectionable\r\nenactment, unconstitutional in effect and injurious in terms to a large\r\nportion of the States.\r\n\r\nIs it the fact that in all the unsettled regions of the United States,\r\nif emigration be left free to act in this respect for itself, without\r\nlegal prohibitions on either side, slave labor will spontaneously go\r\neverywhere in preference to free labor? Is it the fact that the peculiar\r\ndomestic institutions of the Southern States possess relatively so much\r\nof vigor that wheresoever an avenue is freely opened to all the world\r\nthey will penetrate to the exclusion of those of the Northern States?\r\nIs it the fact that the former enjoy, compared with the latter, such\r\nirresistibly superior vitality, independent of climate, soil, and all\r\nother accidental circumstances, as to be able to produce the supposed\r\nresult in spite of the assumed moral and natural obstacles to its\r\naccomplishment and of the more numerous population of the Northern\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nThe argument of those who advocate the enactment of new laws of\r\nrestriction and condemn the repeal of old ones in effect avers that\r\ntheir particular views of government have no self-extending or\r\nself-sustaining power of their own, and will go nowhere unless forced by\r\nact of Congress. And if Congress do but pause for a moment in the policy\r\nof stern coercion; if it venture to try the experiment of leaving men to\r\njudge for themselves what institutions will best suit them; if it be not\r\nstrained up to perpetual legislative exertion on this point--if Congress\r\nproceed thus to act in the very spirit of liberty, it is at once charged\r\nwith aiming to extend slave labor into all the new Territories of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOf course these imputations on the intentions of Congress in this\r\nrespect, conceived, as they were, in prejudice and disseminated in\r\npassion, are utterly destitute of any justification in the nature of\r\nthings and contrary to all the fundamental doctrines and principles of\r\ncivil liberty and self-government.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, in general, the people of the Northern States\r\nhave never at any time arrogated for the Federal Government the\r\npower to interfere directly with the domestic condition of persons\r\nin the Southern States, but, on the contrary, have disavowed all such\r\nintentions and have shrunk from conspicuous affiliation with those few\r\nwho pursue their fanatical objects avowedly through the contemplated\r\nmeans of revolutionary change of the Government and with acceptance of\r\nthe necessary consequences--a civil and servile war--yet many citizens\r\nhave suffered themselves to be drawn into one evanescent political issue\r\nof agitation after another, appertaining to the same set of opinions,\r\nand which subsided as rapidly as they arose when it came to be seen, as\r\nit uniformly did, that they were incompatible with the compacts of the\r\nConstitution and the existence of the Union. Thus when the acts of some\r\nof the States to nullify the existing extradition law imposed upon\r\nCongress the duty of passing a new one, the country was invited by\r\nagitators to enter into party organization for its repeal; but that\r\nagitation speedily ceased by reason of the impracticability of its\r\nobject. So when the statute restriction upon the institutions of new\r\nStates by a geographical line had been repealed, the country was urged\r\nto demand its restoration, and that project also died almost with its\r\nbirth. Then followed the cry of alarm from the North against imputed\r\nSouthern encroachments, which cry sprang in reality from the spirit of\r\nrevolutionary attack on the domestic institutions of the South, and,\r\nafter a troubled existence of a few months, has been rebuked by the\r\nvoice of a patriotic people.\r\n\r\nOf this last agitation, one lamentable feature was that it was carried\r\non at the immediate expense of the peace and happiness of the people of\r\nthe Territory of Kansas. That was made the battlefield, not so much of\r\nopposing factions or interests within itself as of the conflicting\r\npassions of the whole people of the United States. Revolutionary\r\ndisorder in Kansas had its origin in projects of intervention\r\ndeliberately arranged by certain members of that Congress which enacted\r\nthe law for the organization of the Territory; and when propagandist\r\ncolonization of Kansas had thus been undertaken in one section of the\r\nUnion for the systematic promotion of its peculiar views of policy there\r\nensued as a matter of course a counteraction with opposite views in\r\nother sections of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these and other incidents, many acts of disorder,\r\nit is undeniable, have been perpetrated in Kansas, to the occasional\r\ninterruption rather than the permanent suspension of regular government.\r\nAggressive and most reprehensible incursions into the Territory were\r\nundertaken both in the North and the South, and entered it on its\r\nnorthern border by the way of Iowa, as well as on the eastern by way\r\nof Missouri; and there has existed within it a state of insurrection\r\nagainst the constituted authorities, not without countenance from\r\ninconsiderate persons in each of the great sections of the Union. But\r\nthe difficulties in that Territory have been extravagantly exaggerated\r\nfor purposes of political agitation elsewhere. The number and gravity of\r\nthe acts of violence have been magnified partly by statements entirely\r\nuntrue and partly by reiterated accounts of the same rumors or facts.\r\nThus the Territory has been seemingly filled with extreme violence,\r\nwhen the whole amount of such acts has not been greater than what\r\noccasionally passes before us in single cities to the regret of all\r\ngood citizens, but without being regarded as of general or permanent\r\npolitical consequence.\r\n\r\nImputed irregularities in the elections had in Kansas, like occasional\r\nirregularities of the same description in the States, were beyond the\r\nsphere of action of the Executive. But incidents of actual violence or\r\nof organized obstruction of law, pertinaciously renewed from time to\r\ntime, have been met as they occurred by such means as were available and\r\nas the circumstances required, and nothing of this character now remains\r\nto affect the general peace of the Union. The attempt of a part of the\r\ninhabitants of the Territory to erect a revolutionary government, though\r\nsedulously encouraged and supplied with pecuniary aid from active agents\r\nof disorder in some of the States, has completely failed. Bodies of\r\narmed men, foreign to the Territory, have been prevented from entering\r\nor compelled to leave it; predatory bands, engaged in acts of rapine\r\nunder cover of the existing political disturbances, have been arrested\r\nor dispersed, and every well-disposed person is now enabled once more to\r\ndevote himself in peace to the pursuits of prosperous industry, for the\r\nprosecution of which he undertook to participate in the settlement of\r\nthe Territory.\r\n\r\nIt affords me unmingled satisfaction thus to announce the peaceful\r\ncondition of things in Kansas, especially considering the means to which\r\nit was necessary to have recourse for the attainment of the end, namely,\r\nthe employment of a part of the military force of the United States. The\r\nwithdrawal of that force from its proper duty of defending the country\r\nagainst foreign foes or the savages of the frontier to employ it for\r\nthe suppression of domestic insurrection is, when the exigency occurs,\r\na matter of the most earnest solicitude. On this occasion of imperative\r\nnecessity it has been done with the best results, and my satisfaction\r\nin the attainment of such results by such means is greatly enhanced by\r\nthe consideration that, through the wisdom and energy of the present\r\nexecutive of Kansas and the prudence, firmness, and vigilance of the\r\nmilitary officers on duty there tranquillity has been restored without\r\none drop of blood having been shed in its accomplishment by the forces\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of comparative tranquillity in that Territory furnishes\r\nthe means of observing calmly and appreciating at their just value the\r\nevents which have occurred there and the discussions of which the\r\ngovernment of the Territory has been the subject.\r\n\r\nWe perceive that controversy concerning its future domestic institutions\r\nwas inevitable; that no human prudence, no form of legislation, no\r\nwisdom on the part of Congress, could have prevented it.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to suppose that the particular provisions of their organic\r\nlaw were the cause of agitation. Those provisions were but the occasion,\r\nor the pretext, of an agitation which was inherent in the nature of\r\nthings. Congress legislated upon the subject in such terms as were most\r\nconsonant with the principle of popular sovereignty which underlies our\r\nGovernment. It could not have legislated otherwise without doing\r\nviolence to another great principle of our institutions--the\r\nimprescriptible right of equality of the several States.\r\n\r\nWe perceive also that sectional interests and party passions have been\r\nthe great impediment to the salutary operation of the organic principles\r\nadopted and the chief cause of the successive disturbances in Kansas,\r\nThe assumption that because in the organization of the Territories of\r\nNebraska and Kansas Congress abstained from imposing restraints upon\r\nthem to which certain other Territories had been subject, therefore\r\ndisorders occurred in the latter Territory, is emphatically contradicted\r\nby the fact that none have occurred in the former. Those disorders were\r\nnot the consequence, in Kansas, of the freedom of self-government\r\nconceded to that Territory by Congress, but of unjust interference on\r\nthe part of persons not inhabitants of the Territory. Such interference,\r\nwherever it has exhibited itself by acts of insurrectionary character or\r\nof obstruction to process of law, has been repelled or suppressed by all\r\nthe means which the Constitution and the laws place in the hands of the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the United States where, by reason of the inflamed\r\nstate of the public mind, false rumors and misrepresentations have\r\nthe greatest currency it has been assumed that it was the duty of the\r\nExecutive not only to suppress insurrectionary movements in Kansas,\r\nbut also to see to the regularity of local elections. It needs little\r\nargument to show that the President has no such power. All government in\r\nthe United States rests substantially upon popular election. The freedom\r\nof elections is liable to be impaired by the intrusion of unlawful votes\r\nor the exclusion of lawful ones, by improper influences, by violence,\r\nor by fraud. But the people of the United States are themselves the\r\nall-sufficient guardians of their own rights, and to suppose that they\r\nwill not remedy in due season any such incidents of civil freedom is\r\nto suppose them to have ceased to be capable of self-government. The\r\nPresident of the United States has not power to interpose in elections,\r\nto see to their freedom, to canvass their votes, or to pass upon their\r\nlegality in the Territories any more than in the States. If he had such\r\npower the Government might be republican in form, but it would be a\r\nmonarchy in fact; and if he had undertaken to exercise it in the case of\r\nKansas he would have been justly subject to the charge of usurpation and\r\nof violation of the dearest rights of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnwise laws, equally with irregularities at elections, are in periods\r\nof great excitement the occasional incidents of even the freest and\r\nbest political institutions; but all experience demonstrates that in a\r\ncountry like ours, where the right of self-constitution exists in the\r\ncompletest form, the attempt to remedy unwise legislation by resort\r\nto revolution is totally out of place, inasmuch as existing legal\r\ninstitutions afford more prompt and efficacious means for the redress\r\nof wrong.\r\n\r\nI confidently trust that now, when the peaceful condition of Kansas\r\naffords opportunity for calm reflection and wise legislation, either\r\nthe legislative assembly of the Territory or Congress will see that\r\nno act shall remain on its statute book violative of the provisions\r\nof the Constitution or subversive of the great objects for which\r\nthat was ordained and established, and will take all other necessary\r\nsteps to assure to its inhabitants the enjoyment, without obstruction or\r\nabridgment, of all the constitutional rights, privileges, and immunities\r\nof citizens of the United States, as contemplated by the organic law of\r\nthe Territory.\r\n\r\nFull information in relation to recent events in this Territory will be\r\nfound in the documents communicated herewith from the Departments of\r\nState and War.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for\r\nparticular information concerning the financial condition of the\r\nGovernment and the various branches of the public service connected\r\nwith the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the receipts from customs were for the first\r\ntime more than $64,000,000, and from all sources $73,918,141, which,\r\nwith the balance on hand up to the 1st of July, 1855, made the total\r\nresources of the year amount to $92,850,117. The expenditures, including\r\n$3,000,000 in execution of the treaty with Mexico and excluding sums\r\npaid on account of the public debt, amounted to $60,172,401, and\r\nincluding the latter to $72,948,792, the payment on this account having\r\namounted to $12,776,390.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1853, the amount of the public debt was\r\n$69,129,937. There was a subsequent increase of $2,750,000 for the debt\r\nof Texas, making a total of $71,879,937. Of this the sum of $45,525,319,\r\nincluding premium, has been discharged, reducing the debt to\r\n$30,963,909, all which might be paid within a year without embarrassing\r\nthe public service, but being not yet due and only redeemable at the\r\noption of the holder, can not be pressed to payment by the Government.\r\n\r\nOn examining the expenditures of the last five years it will be seen\r\nthat the average, deducting payments on account of the public debt and\r\n$10,000,000 paid by treaty to Mexico, has been but about $48,000,000.\r\nIt is believed that under an economical administration of the Government\r\nthe average expenditure for the ensuing five years will not exceed that\r\nsum, unless extraordinary occasion for its increase should occur. The\r\nacts granting bounty lands will soon have been executed, while the\r\nextension of our frontier settlements will cause a continued demand\r\nfor lands and augmented receipts, probably, from that source. These\r\nconsiderations will justify a reduction of the revenue from customs\r\nso as not to exceed forty-eight or fifty million dollars. I think the\r\nexigency for such reduction is imperative, and again urge it upon the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe amount of reduction, as well as the manner of effecting it,\r\nare questions of great and general interest, it being essential to\r\nindustrial enterprise and the public prosperity, as well as the dictate\r\nof obvious justice, that the burden of taxation be made to rest as\r\nequally as possible upon all classes and all sections and interests\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore recommended to your consideration the revision of\r\nthe revenue laws, prepared under the direction of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and also legislation upon some special questions affecting the\r\nbusiness of that Department, more especially the enactment of a law to\r\npunish the abstraction of official books or papers from the files of the\r\nGovernment and requiring all such books and papers and all other public\r\nproperty to be turned over by the outgoing officer to his successor;\r\nof a law requiring disbursing officers to deposit all public money in\r\nthe vaults of the Treasury or in other legal depositories, where the\r\nsame are conveniently accessible, and a law to extend existing penal\r\nprovisions to all persons who may become possessed of public money by\r\ndeposit or otherwise and who shall refuse or neglect on due demand to\r\npay the same into the Treasury. I invite your attention anew to each\r\nof these objects.\r\n\r\nThe Army during the past year has been so constantly employed against\r\nhostile Indians in various quarters that it can scarcely be said, with\r\npropriety of language, to have been a peace establishment. Its duties\r\nhave been satisfactorily performed, and we have reason to expect as\r\na result of the year's operations greater security to the frontier\r\ninhabitants than has been hitherto enjoyed. Extensive combinations among\r\nthe hostile Indians of the Territories of Washington and Oregon at one\r\ntime threatened the devastation of the newly formed settlements of that\r\nremote portion of the country. From recent information we are permitted\r\nto hope that the energetic and successful operations conducted there\r\nwill prevent such combinations in future and secure to those Territories\r\nan opportunity to make steady progress in the development of their\r\nagricultural and mineral resources.\r\n\r\nLegislation has been recommended by me on previous occasions to cure\r\ndefects in the existing organization and to increase the efficiency of\r\nthe Army, and further observation has but served to confirm me in the\r\nviews then expressed and to enforce on my mind the conviction that such\r\nmeasures are not only proper, but necessary.\r\n\r\nI have, in addition, to invite the attention of Congress to a change of\r\npolicy in the distribution of troops and to the necessity of providing\r\na more rapid increase of the military armament. For details of these\r\nand other subjects relating to the Army I refer to the report of the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Navy is not merely satisfactory, but exhibits the\r\nmost gratifying evidences of increased vigor. As it is comparatively\r\nsmall, it is more important that it should be as complete as possible\r\nin all the elements of strength; that it should be efficient in the\r\ncharacter of its officers, in the zeal and discipline of its men, in the\r\nreliability of its ordnance, and in the capacity of its ships. In all\r\nthese various qualities the Navy has made great progress within the last\r\nfew years. The execution of the law of Congress of February 28, 1855,\r\n\"to promote the efficiency of the Navy,\" has been attended by the most\r\nadvantageous results. The law for promoting discipline among the men\r\nis found convenient and salutary. The system of granting an honorable\r\ndischarge to faithful seamen on the expiration of the period of their\r\nenlistment and permitting them to reenlist after a leave of absence\r\nof a few months without cessation of pay is highly beneficial in its\r\ninfluence. The apprentice system recently adopted is evidently destined\r\nto incorporate into the service a large number of our countrymen,\r\nhitherto so difficult to procure. Several hundred American boys are\r\nnow on a three years' cruise in our national vessels and will return\r\nwell-trained seamen. In the Ordnance Department there is a decided and\r\ngratifying indication of progress, creditable to it and to the country.\r\nThe suggestions of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to further\r\nimprovement in that branch of the service I commend to your favorable\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe new frigates ordered by Congress are now afloat and two of them in\r\nactive service. They are superior models of naval architecture, and with\r\ntheir formidable battery add largely to public strength and security.\r\nI concur in the views expressed by the Secretary of the Department in\r\nfavor of a still further increase of our naval force.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior presents facts and views\r\nin relation to internal affairs over which the supervision of his\r\nDepartment extends of much interest and importance.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate sales of the public lands during the last fiscal year\r\namount to 9,227,878 acres, for which has been received the sum of\r\n$8,821,414. During the same period there have been located with military\r\nscrip and land warrants and for other purposes 30,100,230 acres, thus\r\nmaking a total aggregate of 39,328,108 acres. On the 30th of September\r\nlast surveys had been made of 16,873,699 acres, a large proportion of\r\nwhich is ready for market.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions in this report in regard to the complication and\r\nprogressive expansion of the business of the different bureaus of the\r\nDepartment, to the pension system, to the colonization of Indian tribes,\r\nand the recommendations in relation to various improvements in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia are especially commended to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents fully the condition of\r\nthat Department of the Government. Its expenditures for the last fiscal\r\nyear were $10,407,868 and its gross receipts $7,620,801, making an\r\nexcess of expenditure over receipts of $2,787,046. The deficiency\r\nof this Department is thus $744,000 greater than for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1853. Of this deficiency $330,000 is to be attributed to the\r\nadditional compensation allowed to postmasters by the act of Congress\r\nof June 22, 1854. The mail facilities in every part of the country have\r\nbeen very much increased in that period, and the large addition of\r\nrailroad service, amounting to 7,908 miles, has added largely to the\r\ncost of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe inconsiderable augmentation of the income of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment under the reduced rates of postage and its increasing\r\nexpenditures must for the present make it dependent to some extent\r\nupon the Treasury for support. The recommendations of the\r\nPostmaster-General in relation to the abolition of the franking\r\nprivilege and his views on the establishment of mail steamship lines\r\ndeserve the consideration of Congress. I also call the special attention\r\nof Congress to the statement of the Postmaster-General respecting the\r\nsums now paid for the transportation of mails to the Panama Railroad\r\nCompany, and commend to their early and favorable consideration the\r\nsuggestions of that officer in relation to new contracts for mail\r\ntransportation upon that route, and also upon the Tehuantepec and\r\nNicaragua routes.\r\n\r\nThe United States continue in the enjoyment of amicable relations with\r\nall foreign powers.\r\n\r\nWhen my last annual message was transmitted to Congress two subjects of\r\ncontroversy, one relating to the enlistment of soldiers in this country\r\nfor foreign service and the other to Central America, threatened to\r\ndisturb the good understanding between the United States and Great\r\nBritain. Of the progress and termination of the former question you were\r\ninformed at the time, and the other is now in the way of satisfactory\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\nThe object of the convention between the United States and Great Britain\r\nof the 19th of April, 1850, was to secure for the benefit of all nations\r\nthe neutrality and the common use of any transit way or interoceanic\r\ncommunication across the Isthmus of Panama which might be opened within\r\nthe limits of Central America. The pretensions subsequently asserted by\r\nGreat Britain to dominion or control over territories in or near two of\r\nthe routes, those of Nicaragua and Honduras, were deemed by the United\r\nStates not merely incompatible with the main object of the treaty, but\r\nopposed even to its express stipulations. Occasion of controversy on\r\nthis point has been removed by an additional treaty, which our minister\r\nat London has concluded, and which will be immediately submitted to\r\nthe Senate for its consideration. Should the proposed supplemental\r\narrangement be concurred in by all the parties to be affected by it,\r\nthe objects contemplated by the original convention will have been\r\nfully attained.\r\n\r\nThe treaty between the United States and Great Britain of the 5th of\r\nJune, 1854, which went into effective operation in 1855, put an end to\r\ncauses of irritation between the two countries, by securing to the\r\nUnited States the right of fishery on the coast of the British North\r\nAmerican Provinces, with advantages equal to those enjoyed by British\r\nsubjects. Besides the signal benefits of this treaty to a large class of\r\nour citizens engaged in a pursuit connected to no inconsiderable degree\r\nwith our national prosperity and strength, it has had a favorable effect\r\nupon other interests in the provision it made for reciprocal freedom of\r\ntrade between the United States and the British Provinces in America.\r\n\r\nThe exports of domestic articles to those Provinces during the last year\r\namounted to more than $22,000,000, exceeding those of the preceding year\r\nby nearly $7,000,000; and the imports therefrom during the same period\r\namounted to more than twenty-one million, an increase of six million\r\nupon those of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe improved condition of this branch of our commerce is mainly\r\nattributable to the above-mentioned treaty.\r\n\r\nProvision was made in the first article of that treaty for a commission\r\nto designate the mouths of rivers to which the common right of fishery\r\non the coast of the United States and the British Provinces was not to\r\nextend. This commission has been employed a part of two seasons, but\r\nwithout much progress in accomplishing the object for which it was\r\ninstituted, in consequence of a serious difference of opinion between\r\nthe commissioners, not only as to the precise point where the rivers\r\nterminate, but in many instances as to what constitutes a river. These\r\ndifficulties, however, may be overcome by resort to the umpirage\r\nprovided for by the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe efforts perseveringly prosecuted since the commencement of my\r\nAdministration to relieve our trade to the Baltic from the exaction of\r\nSound dues by Denmark have not yet been attended with success. Other\r\ngovernments have also sought to obtain a like relief to their commerce,\r\nand Denmark was thus induced to propose an arrangement to all the\r\nEuropean powers interested in the subject, and the manner in which her\r\nproposition was received warranting her to believe that a satisfactory\r\narrangement with them could soon be concluded, she made a strong appeal\r\nto this Government for temporary suspension of definite action on its\r\npart, in consideration of the embarrassment which might result to her\r\nEuropean negotiations by an immediate adjustment of the question with\r\nthe United States. This request has been acceded to upon the condition\r\nthat the sums collected after the 16th of June last and until the 16th\r\nof June next from vessels and cargoes belonging to our merchants are to\r\nbe considered as paid under protest and subject to future adjustment.\r\nThere is reason to believe that an arrangement between Denmark and the\r\nmaritime powers of Europe on the subject will be soon concluded, and\r\nthat the pending negotiation with the United States may then be resumed\r\nand terminated in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nWith Spain no new difficulties have arisen, nor has much progress been\r\nmade in the adjustment of pending ones.\r\n\r\nNegotiations entered into for the purpose of relieving our commercial\r\nintercourse with the island of Cuba of some of its burdens and providing\r\nfor the more speedy settlement of local disputes growing out of that\r\nintercourse have not yet been attended with any results.\r\n\r\nSoon after the commencement of the late war in Europe this Government\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of all maritime nations two principles\r\nfor the security of neutral commerce--one that the neutral flag should\r\ncover enemies' goods, except articles contraband of war, and the other\r\nthat neutral property on board merchant vessels of belligerents should\r\nbe exempt from condemnation, with the exception of contraband articles.\r\nThese were not presented as new rules of international law, having\r\nbeen generally claimed by neutrals, though not always admitted by\r\nbelligerents. One of the parties to the war (Russia), as well as several\r\nneutral powers, promptly acceded to these propositions, and the two\r\nother principal belligerents (Great Britain and France) having consented\r\nto observe them for the present occasion, a favorable opportunity seemed\r\nto be presented for obtaining a general recognition of them, both in\r\nEurope and America.\r\n\r\nBut Great Britain and France, in common with most of the States of\r\nEurope, while forbearing to reject, did not affirmatively act upon the\r\novertures of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile the question was in this position the representatives of Russia,\r\nFrance, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, and Turkey, assembled\r\nat Paris, took into consideration the subject of maritime rights,\r\nand put forth a declaration containing the two principles which this\r\nGovernment had submitted nearly two years before to the consideration\r\nof maritime powers, and adding thereto the following propositions:\r\n\"Privateering is and remains abolished,\" and \"Blockades in order to\r\nbe binding must be effective; that is to say, maintained by a force\r\nsufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy;\" and to\r\nthe declaration thus composed of four points, two of which had already\r\nbeen proposed by the United States, this Government has been invited to\r\naccede by all the powers represented at Paris except Great Britain and\r\nTurkey. To the last of the two additional propositions--that in relation\r\nto blockades--there can certainly be no objection. It is merely the\r\ndefinition of what shall constitute the effectual investment of a\r\nblockaded place, a definition for which this Government has always\r\ncontended, claiming indemnity for losses where a practical violation\r\nof the rule thus defined has been injurious to our commerce. As to the\r\nremaining, article of the declaration of the conference of Paris, that\r\n\"privateering is and remains abolished,\" I certainly can not ascribe to\r\nthe powers represented in the conference of Paris any but liberal and\r\nphilanthropic views in the attempt to change the unquestionable rule of\r\nmaritime law in regard to privateering. Their proposition was doubtless\r\nintended to imply approval of the principle that private property upon\r\nthe ocean, although it might belong to the citizens of a belligerent\r\nstate, should be exempted from capture; and had that proposition been so\r\nframed as to give full effect to the principle, it would have received\r\nmy ready assent on behalf of the United States. But the measure proposed\r\nis inadequate to that purpose. It is true that if adopted private\r\nproperty upon the ocean would be withdrawn from one mode of plunder,\r\nbut left exposed meanwhile to another mode, which could be used with\r\nincreased effectiveness. The aggressive capacity of great naval powers\r\nwould be thereby augmented, while the defensive ability of others would\r\nbe reduced. Though the surrender of the means of prosecuting hostilities\r\nby employing privateers, as proposed by the conference of Paris, is\r\nmutual in terms, yet in practical effect it would be the relinquishment\r\nof a right of little value to one class of states, but of essential\r\nimportance to another and a far larger class. It ought not to have been\r\nanticipated that a measure so inadequate to the accomplishment of the\r\nproposed object and so unequal in its operation would receive the assent\r\nof all maritime powers. Private property would be still left to the\r\ndepredations of the public armed cruisers.\r\n\r\nI have expressed a readiness on the part of this Government to accede\r\nto all the principles contained in the declaration of the conference of\r\nParis provided that the one relating to the abandonment of privateering\r\ncan be so amended as to effect the object for which, as is presumed, it\r\nwas intended--the immunity of private property on the ocean from hostile\r\ncapture. To effect this object, it is proposed to add to the declaration\r\nthat \"privateering is and remains abolished\" the following amendment:\r\n\r\n\r\n  And that the private property of subjects and citizens of a belligerent\r\n  on the high seas shall be exempt from seizure by the public armed\r\n  vessels of the other belligerent, except it be contraband.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis amendment has been presented not only to the powers which have\r\nasked our assent to the declaration to abolish privateering, but to all\r\nother maritime states. Thus far it has not been rejected by any, and is\r\nfavorably entertained by all which have made any communication in reply.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the governments regarding with favor the proposition of\r\nthe United States have delayed definitive action upon it only for the\r\npurpose of consulting with others, parties to the conference of Paris.\r\nI have the satisfaction of stating, however, that the Emperor of Russia\r\nhas entirely and explicitly approved of that modification and will\r\ncooperate in endeavoring to obtain the assent of other powers, and that\r\nassurances of a similar purport have been received in relation to the\r\ndisposition of the Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\nThe present aspect of this important subject allows us to cherish the\r\nhope that a principle so humane in its character, so just and equal in\r\nits operation, so essential to the prosperity of commercial nations, and\r\nso consonant to the sentiments of this enlightened period of the world\r\nwill command the approbation of all maritime powers, and thus be\r\nincorporated into the code of international law.\r\n\r\nMy views on the subject are more fully set forth in the reply of the\r\nSecretary of State, a copy of which is herewith transmitted, to the\r\ncommunications on the subject made to this Government, especially to\r\nthe communication of France.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States has at all times regarded with\r\nfriendly interest the other States of America, formerly, like this\r\ncountry, European colonies, and now independent members of the great\r\nfamily of nations. But the unsettled condition of some of them,\r\ndistracted by frequent revolutions, and thus incapable of regular and\r\nfirm internal administration, has tended to embarrass occasionally our\r\npublic intercourse by reason of wrongs which our citizens suffer at\r\ntheir hands, and which they are slow to redress.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is against the Republic of Mexico, with which it\r\nis our special desire to maintain a good understanding, that such\r\ncomplaints are most numerous; and although earnestly urged upon its\r\nattention, they have not as yet received the consideration which this\r\nGovernment had a right to expect. While reparation for past injuries has\r\nbeen withheld, others have been added. The political condition of that\r\ncountry, however, has been such as to demand forbearance on the part of\r\nthe United States. I shall continue my efforts to procure for the wrongs\r\nof our citizens that redress which is indispensable to the continued\r\nfriendly association of the two Republics.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar condition of affairs in Nicaragua in the early part of the\r\npresent year rendered it important that this Government should have\r\ndiplomatic relations with that State. Through its territory had been\r\nopened one of the principal thoroughfares across the isthmus connecting\r\nNorth and South America, on which a vast amount of property was\r\ntransported and to which our citizens resorted in great numbers in\r\npassing between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States.\r\nThe protection of both required that the existing power in that State\r\nshould be regarded as a responsible Government, and its minister was\r\naccordingly received. But he remained here only a short time. Soon\r\nthereafter the political affairs of Nicaragua underwent unfavorable\r\nchange and became involved in much uncertainty and confusion. Diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives from two contending parties have been recently sent to\r\nthis Government, but with the imperfect information possessed it was not\r\npossible to decide which was the Government _de facto_, and, awaiting\r\nfurther developments, I have refused to receive either.\r\n\r\nQuestions of the most serious nature are pending between the United\r\nStates and the Republic of New Granada. The Government of that Republic\r\nundertook a year since to impose tonnage duties on foreign vessels in\r\nher ports, but the purpose was resisted by this Government as being\r\ncontrary to existing treaty stipulations with the United States and\r\nto rights conferred by charter upon the Panama Railroad Company, and\r\nwas accordingly relinquished at that time, it being admitted that our\r\nvessels were entitled to be exempt from tonnage duty in the free ports\r\nof Panama and Aspinwall. But the purpose has been recently revived on\r\nthe part of New Granada by the enactment of a law to subject vessels\r\nvisiting her ports to the tonnage duty of 40 cents per ton, and although\r\nthe law has not been put in force, yet the right to enforce it is still\r\nasserted and may at any time be acted on by the Government of that\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of New Granada has also enacted a law during the last\r\nyear which levies a tax of more than $3 on every pound of mail matter\r\ntransported across the Isthmus. The sum thus required to be paid on\r\nthe mails of the United States would be nearly $2,000,000 annually in\r\naddition to the large sum payable by contract to the Panama Railroad\r\nCompany. If the only objection to this exaction were the exorbitancy\r\nof its amount, it could not be submitted to by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe imposition of it, however, would obviously contravene our treaty\r\nwith New Granada and infringe the contract of that Republic with the\r\nPanama Railroad Company. The law providing for this tax was by its terms\r\nto take effect on the ist of September last, but the local authorities\r\non the Isthmus have been induced to suspend its execution and to await\r\nfurther instructions on the subject from the Government of the Republic.\r\nI am not yet advised of the determination of that Government. If a\r\nmeasure so extraordinary in its character and so clearly contrary to\r\ntreaty stipulations and the contract rights of the Panama Railroad\r\nCompany, composed mostly of American citizens, should be persisted\r\nin, it will be the duty of the United States to resist its execution.\r\n\r\nI regret exceedingly that occasion exists to invite your attention to\r\na subject of still graver import in our relations with the Republic of\r\nNew Granada. On the 15th day of April last a riotous assemblage of the\r\ninhabitants of Panama committed a violent and outrageous attack on the\r\npremises of the railroad company and the passengers and other persons\r\nin or near the same, involving the death of several citizens of the\r\nUnited States, the pillage of many others, and the destruction of a\r\nlarge amount of property belonging to the railroad company. I caused\r\nfull investigation of that event to be made, and the result shows\r\nsatisfactorily that complete responsibility for what occurred attaches\r\nto the Government of New Granada. I have therefore demanded of that\r\nGovernment that the perpetrators of the wrongs in question should be\r\npunished; that provision should be made for the families of citizens of\r\nthe United States who were killed, with full indemnity for the property\r\npillaged or destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Isthmus of Panama, in so far as regards\r\nthe security of persons and property passing over it, requires serious\r\nconsideration. Recent incidents tend to show that the local authorities\r\ncan not be relied on to maintain the public peace of Panama, and there\r\nis just ground for apprehension that a portion of the inhabitants are\r\nmeditating further outrages, without adequate measures for the security\r\nand protection of persons or property having been taken, either by the\r\nState of Panama or by the General Government of New Granada.\r\n\r\nUnder the guaranties of treaty, citizens of the United States have, by\r\nthe outlay of several million dollars, constructed a railroad across\r\nthe Isthmus, and it has become the main route between our Atlantic\r\nand Pacific possessions, over which multitudes of our citizens and a\r\nvast amount of property are constantly passing; to the security and\r\nprotection of all which and the continuance of the public advantages\r\ninvolved it is impossible for the Government of the United States to\r\nbe indifferent.\r\n\r\nI have deemed the danger of the recurrence of scenes of lawless violence\r\nin this quarter so imminent as to make it my duty to station a part of\r\nour naval force in the harbors of Panama and Aspinwall, in order to\r\nprotect the persons and property of the citizens of the United States\r\nin those ports and to insure to them safe passage across the Isthmus.\r\nAnd it would, in my judgment, be unwise to withdraw the naval force now\r\nin those ports until, by the spontaneous action of the Republic of New\r\nGranada or otherwise, some adequate arrangement shall have been made for\r\nthe protection and security of a line of interoceanic communication, so\r\nimportant at this time not to the United States only, but to all other\r\nmaritime states, both of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile negotiations have been instituted, by means of a special\r\ncommission, to obtain from New Granada full indemnity for injuries\r\nsustained by our citizens on the Isthmus and satisfactory security\r\nfor the general interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn addressing to you my last annual message the occasion seems to me\r\nan appropriate one to express my congratulations, in view of the peace,\r\ngreatness, and felicity which the United States now possess and enjoy.\r\nTo point you to the state of the various Departments of the Government\r\nand of all the great branches of the public service, civil and military,\r\nin order to speak of the intelligence and the integrity which pervades\r\nthe whole, would be to indicate but imperfectly the administrative\r\ncondition of the country and the beneficial effects of that on the\r\ngeneral welfare. Nor would it suffice to say that the nation is actually\r\nat peace at home and abroad; that its industrial interests are\r\nprosperous; that the canvas of its mariners whitens every sea, and the\r\nplow of its husbandmen is marching steadily onward to the bloodless\r\nconquest of the continent; that cities and populous States are springing\r\nup, as if by enchantment, from the bosom of our Western wilds, and that\r\nthe courageous energy of our people is making of these United States\r\nthe great Republic of the world. These results have not been attained\r\nwithout passing through trials and perils, by experience of which,\r\nand thus only, nations can harden into manhood. Our forefathers were\r\ntrained to the wisdom which conceived and the courage which achieved\r\nindependence by the circumstances which surrounded them, and they were\r\nthus made capable of the creation of the Republic. It devolved on the\r\nnext generation to consolidate the work of the Revolution, to deliver\r\nthe country entirely from the influences of conflicting transatlantic\r\npartialities or antipathies which attached to our colonial and\r\nRevolutionary history, and to organize the practical operation of\r\nthe constitutional and legal institutions of the Union. To us of\r\nthis generation remains the not less noble task of maintaining and\r\nextending the national power. We have at length reached that stage\r\nof our country's career in which the dangers to be encountered and\r\nthe exertions to be made are the incidents, not of weakness, but of\r\nstrength. In foreign relations we have to attemper our power to the less\r\nhappy condition of other Republics in America and to place ourselves in\r\nthe calmness and conscious dignity of right by the side of the greatest\r\nand wealthiest of the Empires of Europe. In domestic relations we have\r\nto guard against the shock of the discontents, the ambitions, the\r\ninterests, and the exuberant, and therefore sometimes irregular,\r\nimpulses of opinion or of action which are the natural product of the\r\npresent political elevation, the self-reliance, and the restless spirit\r\nof enterprise of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nI shall prepare to surrender the Executive trust to my successor and\r\nretire to private life with sentiments of profound gratitude to the good\r\nProvidence which during the period of my Administration has vouchsafed\r\nto carry the country through many difficulties, domestic and foreign,\r\nand which enables me to contemplate the spectacle of amicable and\r\nrespectful relations between ours and all other governments and the\r\nestablishment of constitutional order and tranquillity throughout the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report[63] from the Secretary of State, in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n7th of August last.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Stating that the correspondence in the Departments of State\r\nand of the Navy relative to Hamet Caramally had been transmitted to\r\nCongress.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States and Siam, concluded\r\nat Bangkok on the 29th day of May last.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty for the settlement of the questions which have\r\ncome into discussion between the United States and Great Britain\r\nrelative to Central America, concluded and signed at London on the\r\n17th day of October last between the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 12, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a letter of the 20th of May last from the\r\ncommissioner of the United States in China, and of the decree and\r\nregulations[64] which accompanied it, for such revision thereof as\r\nCongress may deem expedient, pursuant to the sixth section of the\r\nact approved 11th August, 1848.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: For judicial jurisdiction by acting consuls or vice-consuls\r\nof the United States in China.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 15, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress an extract from a letter of the 22d ultimo from\r\nthe governor of the Territory of Kansas to the Secretary of State, with\r\na copy of the executive minutes[65] to which it refers.
