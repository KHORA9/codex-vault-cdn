ROBT. SMALLS.\r\n\r\n  WITH THE\r\n  RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE\r\n  PASSED BY THE\r\n  CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n  COMPILED BY MISS SARAH V. SMALLS.\r\n\r\n  ENQUIRER PRINT, 425 KING STREET.\r\n  CHARLESTON, S. C.\r\n  1896\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonths previous to the time that the recent Constitutional Convention\r\nmet, Conservatives and Reformers, announced publicly their intention to\r\ndisfranchise the Negro in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nFor this pamphlet such portions of the new Constitution have been\r\nselected as affect the colored people, together with the speeches made\r\nthereon by my father Robert Smalls; several editorials from leading\r\nnewspapers; also a few of many letters received by him from all parts\r\nof the country congratulating him for the manly spirit displayed by him\r\nand the other colored delegates, whenever the rights of their race were\r\nin jeopardy.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may have been an object lesson, planned by the All-wise God,\r\nto teach the haughty, boastful sons of Carolina that there are Negroes\r\ncapable and amply qualified in every respect to protect themselves\r\nwhenever it becomes necessary to do so; that those few representatives\r\nof the race were but a _very small_ part of the rising host that time\r\nand education are bringing forward day by day in spite of lynching,\r\ncaste prejudice or any methods used against them.\r\n\r\nNo stenographers were employed by the Convention, the speeches were not\r\nwritten, and are therefore not given in full, but just as they were\r\npublished in the papers of the State.\r\n\r\n  SARAH V. SMALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following plan of suffrage was introduced by Hon. Robert Smalls\r\nand referred to the suffrage committee, which reported it unfavorably,\r\nnotwithstanding that he went before the committee and made a strong\r\nspeech in advocacy of the said plan, and said report was adopted by the\r\nConvention:\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. In all elections by the people the electors shall vote by\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. Every male citizen of the United States of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years and upwards, not laboring under the disabilities named\r\nin this Constitution, without distinction of race, color or former\r\ncondition, who shall be a resident of this State at the time of the\r\nadoption of this Constitution, or who shall thereafter reside in this\r\nState one year, and in the county in which he offers to vote sixty days\r\nnext preceding any election, shall be entitled to vote for all officers\r\nthat are now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all\r\nquestions submitted to the electors at any elections; provided, That no\r\nperson shall be allowed to vote or hold office who is now, or hereafter\r\nmay be, disqualified therefor by the Constitution of the United States,\r\nuntil such disqualification shall be removed by the Congress of the\r\nUnited States; provided, further, That no person while kept in any alms\r\nhouse or asylum, or any of unsound mind, or confined in any public\r\nprison, shall be allowed to vote or hold office.\r\n\r\nSEC. 3. It shall be the duty of the General Assembly to provide from\r\ntime to time for the registration of all electors.\r\n\r\nSEC. 4. For the purpose of voting, no person shall be deemed to have\r\nlost his residence by reason of absence while employed in the service\r\nof the United States, nor while engaged upon the waters of this State,\r\nor the United States, or the high seas, nor while temporarily absent\r\nfrom the State, or removing from one house to another or from one place\r\nto another in the same precinct.\r\n\r\nSEC. 5. No soldier, seaman or marine in the army or navy of the United\r\nStates shall be deemed a resident of this State in consequence of\r\nhaving been stationed therein.\r\n\r\nSEC. 6. Electors shall in all cases, except treason, felony, or breach\r\nof the peace, be privileged from arrest and civil process during\r\nattendance at elections and in going to and returning from the same.\r\n\r\nSEC. 7. Every person entitled to vote at any election shall be eligible\r\nto any office, which now is, or hereafter shall be elective by the\r\npeople in the county where he shall have resided sixty days previous to\r\nsuch election, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution or the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States.\r\n\r\nSEC. 8. The General Assembly shall never pass any law that will deprive\r\nany of the citizens of this State of the right of suffrage, except for\r\ntreason, murder, robbery, or duelling, whereof the persons shall have\r\nbeen duly tried and convicted.\r\n\r\nSEC. 9. Presidential electors shall be elected by the people.\r\n\r\nSEC. 10. In all elections, State and Federal, there shall be but one\r\nballot box, and one ticket for each party or faction thereof, with the\r\nnames of all the candidates thereon. There shall be three commissioners\r\nof election for each county and three managers for each polling\r\nprecinct, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nSEC. 11. In all elections held by the people under this Constitution\r\nthe person or persons who shall receive the highest number of votes\r\nshall be declared elected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT: I have been asked whether I would speak on this\r\nimportant matter. I replied that it all depended on circumstances\r\nwhether or not I would. The circumstances are such that I have made up\r\nmy mind to make a short speech on the general bill, and content myself\r\nwith the vote I will cast on the amendments and sections as they are\r\nbrought up; inasmuch as I have been perfectly pleased with the speeches\r\nmade last night, and the one just concluded by the representatives from\r\nmy county, as I feel that they echo the sentiments not only of the\r\ncounty they represent, but the entire race in the State, and every one\r\nI could claim to represent. I endorse their utterances in the language\r\nof Mr. Cash when he said he endorsed “every syllable” and accepted it\r\nas his own in this letter. I want to hear some of the speeches on the\r\nother side, because I do not like this matter that is called Indian\r\nfile, as it seems now we are to form a Negro file in this Convention.\r\nI will only say that this Convention has violated the principle laid\r\ndown in the Constitution under which we are now living, it giving the\r\nright for any two members to call for an “aye” and “nay” vote, but the\r\nskillful chairman of the committee on rules, from Edgefield, I mean\r\nex-governor No. 1, (laughter) has made a rule which requires 10, four\r\nabove the number we have, to call for the “aye” and “nay” vote, hence\r\nwe cannot put the members on record without the assistance of some of\r\nthe white members of the Convention. They formed a “dark corner” over\r\nthere by themselves.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in South Carolina and to-day I live on the very\r\nspot on which I was born, and I expect to remain here as long as the\r\ngreat God allows me to live, and I will ask no one else to let me\r\nremain. I love this State as much as any member of this Convention,\r\nbecause it is the garden spot of the South.\r\n\r\nMr. President, this Convention has been called for no other purpose\r\nthan the disfranchisement of the Negro. Be careful and bear in mind\r\nthat the elections which are to take place early next month in very\r\nmany of the States are watching the action of this Convention,\r\nespecially on the suffrage question. Remember that the Negro was not\r\nbrought here of his own accord. I found by reference to a history in\r\nthe Congressional Library in Washington, written by Neil, that he\r\nsays that in 1619, in the month of June a Dutch man-of-war landed\r\nat Jamestown, Va., with 15 sons of Africa aboard, at the time Miles\r\nKendall was deputy Governor of Virginia. He refused to allow the vessel\r\nto be anchored in any of her harbors. But he found out after his order\r\nhad been sent out that the vessel was without provisions, and the crew\r\nwas in a starving condition. He countermanded his order, and supplied\r\nthe vessel with the needed provisions in exchange for 14 Negroes. It\r\nwas then that the seed of slavery was planted in the land. So you see\r\nwe did not come here of our own accord; we were brought here in a Dutch\r\nvessel, and we have been here ever since. The Dutch are here and are\r\ncontrolling the business of Charleston to-day. They are not to blame,\r\nand are not being blamed.\r\n\r\nWe served our masters faithfully, and willingly, and as we were made\r\nto do for 244 years. In the last war you left them home. You went to\r\nthe war, fought, and came back home, shattered to pieces, worn out,\r\none-legged, and found your wife and family being properly cared for by\r\nthe Negroes you left behind. Why should you now seek to disfranchise a\r\nrace that has been so true to you?\r\n\r\nThis Convention has a good leader in the person of the distinguished\r\ngentleman from Edgefield. Mr. President, when men go out shooting\r\nand want to shoot straight, they are compelled to shut one eye, and\r\nthis leader uses only one eye in this Convention, hence he is always\r\nstriking the bull’s eye; let him beware lest he strikes it one time too\r\noften. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nSince Reconstruction times 53,000 have been killed in the South, and\r\nnot more than three white men have been convicted and hung for these\r\ncrimes. I want you to be mindful of the fact that the good people of\r\nthe North are watching this Convention upon this subject. I hope you\r\nwill make a Constitution that will stand the test. I hope that we\r\nmay be able to say when our work is done that we have made as good a\r\nConstitution as the one we are doing away with.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes are paying taxes in the South on $263,000,000 worth of\r\nproperty. In South Carolina, according to the census, the Negroes pay\r\ntax on $12,500,000 worth of property. That was in 1890. You voted down\r\nwithout discussion merely to lay on the table, a proposition for a\r\nsimple property and educational qualification. What do you want? You\r\ntried the infamous eight-box and registration laws until they were\r\nworn to such a thinness that they could stand neither the test of the\r\nlaw nor of public opinion. In behalf of the 600,000 Negroes in the\r\nState and the 132,000 Negro voters all that I demand is that a fair\r\nand honest election law be passed. We care not what the qualifications\r\nimposed are: all that we ask is that they be fair and honest and\r\nhonorable, and with these provisos we will stand or fall by it. You\r\nhave 102,000 white men over 21 years of age; 13,000 of these cannot\r\nread nor write. You dare not disfranchise them; and you know that the\r\nman who proposes it will never be elected to another office in the\r\nState of South Carolina. But whatever Mr. Tillman can do, he can make\r\nnothing worse than the infamous eight-box law, and I have no praise\r\nfor the Conservatives, for they gave the people that law. Fifty-eight\r\nthousand Negroes cannot read nor write. This leaves a majority of\r\n14,000 white men who can read and write over the same class of Negroes\r\nin this State. We are willing to accept a scheme that provides that no\r\nman who cannot read nor write can vote, if you dare pass it. How can\r\nyou expect an ordinary man to “understand and explain” any section of\r\nthe Constitution, to correspond to the interpretation put upon it by\r\nthe manager of election, when by a very recent decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, composed of the most learned men in the State, two of them put\r\none construction upon a section, and the other Justice put an entirely\r\ndifferent construction upon it. To embody such a provision in the\r\nelection law would be to mean that every white man would interpret\r\nit aright and every Negro would interpret it wrong. I appeal to the\r\ngentleman from Edgefield to realize that he is not making a law for\r\none set of men. Some morning you may wake up to find that the bone\r\nand sinew of your country is gone. The Negro is needed in the cotton\r\nfields and in the low country rice fields, and if you impose too\r\nhard conditions upon the Negro in this State there will be nothing\r\nelse for him to do but to leave. What then will you do about your\r\nphosphate works? No one but a Negro can work them: the mines that pay\r\nthe interest on your State debt. I tell you the Negro is the bone and\r\nsinew of your country and you cannot do without him. I do not believe\r\nyou want to get rid of the Negro, else why did you impose a high tax on\r\nimmigration agents who might come here to get him to leave?\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, we should not talk one thing and mean another. We\r\nshould not deceive ourselves. Let us make a Constitution that is fair,\r\nhonest and just. Let us make a Constitution for all the people, one\r\nwe will be proud of and our children will receive with delight. Don’t\r\nlet us act like a gentleman said he talked. The other day a gentleman\r\ntold me that a prominent lawyer, a member of this Convention, made\r\na very bitter speech against the Negro while he was a candidate for\r\nelection to this Convention. After the lawyer had concluded his speech\r\nof bitterness against the Negro and in favor of white supremacy, some\r\ncolored men waited on him and asked him why he had made such a bitter\r\nspeech against them, saying they had regarded the gentleman as their\r\nfriend, as he had often acted as their lawyer. This gentleman replied\r\nto them: “Don’t mind my speech. I am a friend to the Negro, but I have\r\ngot to make bitter speeches to fool the Crackers because I want their\r\nvotes.” Gentlemen, I warn you that you can fool the Crackers when you\r\ntalk to them, but if you pass this ordinance that has been proposed by\r\nthe committee on suffrage you will fool nobody, for every person in the\r\nnation has been informed of your speeches on the stump and you will not\r\nbe able to explain it away as that lawyer did his words of bitterness\r\nto the colored men who waited on him.\r\n\r\nMr. President, strange things have happened and I have been shocked\r\nin my life, but the greatest surprise of my life was when the\r\ndistinguished lawyer from Barnwell, Mr. Aldrich, introduced a\r\nConstitution in this Convention that was taken verbatim et literatim\r\nfrom the Constitution of ’65 and the black code of ’66, which deprived\r\nevery Negro from holding an office in this State, notwithstanding\r\nthat Constitution and black code were rejected by Congress. That\r\nConstitution caused the passage of the acts of reconstruction by\r\nCongress and made it necessary for the Constitutional Convention\r\nof 1868, which gave to you the best Constitution of any one of the\r\nSouthern States. Let us make a Constitution, Mr. President, that will\r\ndemand the respect of mankind everywhere, for we are not above public\r\nopinion. While in Washington a committee of capitalists came over\r\nfrom England hunting for timber land in which to invest. One of South\r\nCarolina’s Representative in Congress called upon those gentlemen and\r\ninformed them that there were large tracts of land in Beaufort County,\r\nin the Township of Blufton, for sale. They inquired for the name of\r\nthe State, and when they were informed that the timber lands were in\r\nSouth Carolina they answered: “You need not go any further, as our\r\ninstructions were, before we left England, not to invest money in a\r\nState where life and property was not secure under the law.” In God’s\r\nname let us make a Constitution that will receive the approval of\r\neverybody--the outside world as well as those at home.\r\n\r\nSome time ago I heard the distinguished gentleman from Edgefield, I\r\nmean Mr. George D. Tillman, say that the white man wanted elbow room,\r\nand I suppose that this is what this suffrage plan is proposed to\r\ngive him. Again, the other day, in this Convention, I heard him make\r\na very eloquent speech on the township government bill, but before he\r\ngot through he had acted like the good Jersey cow, which gave her two\r\ngallons of milk, and, though she did not put her foot in it before she\r\nwas through, she had shaken so much dirt from her tail into the pail\r\nthat we could not accept the milk. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, I will not detain this Convention, as I had no\r\nintention of making a speech upon this subject, as I said before; but\r\nnow, sir, in the language of Mr. E. B. Cash, in his letter received\r\nfrom the distinguished “Bald Eagle,” of Edgefield, Gen. Mart Gary,\r\n(holding up the letter) let me say that I endorse every letter,\r\nsyllable, verbatim et literatim, and accept as my own the speeches made\r\nby my colleagues last night and this morning. And I would, therefore,\r\nask that the Convention will not vote down the substitute for the\r\nsuffrage bill introduced by my colleague, Mr. Whipper, as they did that\r\nof Mr. Wigg, by a simple motion to lay on the table, but will allow\r\nthis matter to go over, as the attendance is very slim, until Monday. I\r\nask the Senator from Edgefield if he intends to press this matter to a\r\nvote this afternoon.\r\n\r\nSenator Tillman remarked that that was what he proposed to do.\r\n\r\nSmalls--Ah! I am beginning to know the Senator at last. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE PLAN ADOPTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is the plan reported by the suffrage committee, which was\r\nadopted by the Convention, and which is now a part of the Constitution\r\nof South Carolina:\r\n\r\nARTICLE II.\r\n\r\nRIGHT OF SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. All elections by the people shall be by ballot and\r\nelections shall never be held or the ballots counted in secret.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. Every qualified elector shall be eligible to any office\r\nto be voted for, unless disqualified by age as prescribed in this\r\nConstitution.

Every male citizen of this State and of the United States 21\r\nyears of age and upwards, not laboring under the disabilities named\r\nin this Constitution and possessing the qualification required by it,\r\nshall be an elector.\r\n\r\nSEC. 4. The qualifications for suffrage shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Residence in the State for two years, in the county one year, in\r\nthe polling precinct in which the elector offers to vote four months,\r\nand the payment six months before any election of any poll tax then\r\ndue and payable; provided, however, that ministers in charge of an\r\norganized church and teachers of public schools shall be entitled to\r\nvote after six months residence in the State, if otherwise qualified.\r\n\r\n(b) Registration, which shall provide for the enrollment of every\r\nelector once in ten years and also an enrollment during each and every\r\nyear of every elector not previously registered under the provisions on\r\nthis article.\r\n\r\n(c) Up to January 1, 1898, all male persons of voting age applying for\r\nregistration who can read any section in this Constitution submitted\r\nto them by the registration officer, or understand and explain it when\r\nread to them by the registration officer shall be entitled to register\r\nand become electors. A separate record of all persons registered before\r\nJanuary 1, 1898, sworn to by the registration officer shall be filed,\r\none copy with the clerk of court and one in the office of the secretary\r\nof the state, on or before February 1, 1898, and such persons shall\r\nremain during life qualified electors unless disqualified by the other\r\nprovisions of this article. The certificate of the clerk of court or\r\nSecretary of State shall be sufficient evidence to establish the right\r\nof said citizens to any subsequent registration and the franchise under\r\nthe limitations herein imposed.\r\n\r\n(d) Any person who shall apply for registration after January 1st,\r\n1898, if otherwise qualified, shall be registered; provided, that he\r\ncan both read and write any section of this Constitution submitted to\r\nhim by the registration officer, or can show that he owns and has paid\r\nall taxes collectible during the previous year on property in this\r\nState assessed at $300 or more.\r\n\r\n(e) Managers of elections shall require of every elector offering to\r\nvote at any election, before allowing him to vote, proof of the payment\r\nof all taxes, including poll tax, assessed against him and collectible\r\nduring the previous year.

Any person denied registration shall have the right to appeal\r\nto the Court of Common Pleas or any judge thereof, and thence to the\r\nSupreme Court, to determine his right to vote under the limitations\r\nimposed in this article, and on such appeal the hearing shall be de\r\nnovo and the General Assembly shall provide by law for such appeal and\r\nfor the correction of illegal and fraudulent registration, voting and\r\nall other crimes against the election laws.\r\n\r\nSEC. 6. The following persons are disqualified from being registered or\r\nvoting:\r\n\r\nFirst.

The general assembly shall provide by law for the registration\r\nof all qualified electors and shall prescribe the manner of holding\r\nelections and of ascertaining the results, of the same; provided, at\r\nthe first registration under this Constitution, and until the 1st\r\nof January, 1898, the registration shall be conducted by a board\r\nof three discreet persons in each county, to be appointed by the\r\ngovernor, by and with the advice and consent of the senate. For the\r\nfirst registration to be provided for under this Constitution, the\r\nregistration books shall be kept open for at least six consecutive\r\nweeks, and thereafter from time to time at least one week in each\r\nmonth, up to 30 days next preceding the first election to be held under\r\nthis Constitution. The registration books shall be public records open\r\nto the inspection of any citizen at all times.\r\n\r\nSEC. 9. The general assembly shall provide for the establishment of\r\npolling precincts in the several counties of the State and those now\r\nexisting shall so continue until abolished or changed.

The production of a certificate of registration from\r\nthe registration officers of the county as an elector at a precinct\r\nincluded in the incorporated city or town in which the voter desires\r\nto vote is declared a condition prerequisite to his obtaining a\r\ncertificate of registration for municipal elections, and in addition\r\nhe must have been a resident within the corporate limits at least four\r\nmonths before the election and have paid all taxes due and collectible\r\nfor the preceding fiscal year. The general assembly shall provide for\r\nthe registration of all voters before each election in municipalities;\r\nprovided, that nothing herein contained shall apply to any municipal\r\nelection which may be held prior to the general election of the year\r\n1896.\r\n\r\nSEC. 13. In authorizing a special election in any incorporated city or\r\ntown in this State for the purpose of bonding the same, the general\r\nassembly shall prescribe as a condition precedent to the holding of\r\nsaid election a petition from a majority of the freeholders of said\r\ncity or town as shown by its tax books, and at such elections all\r\nelectors of such city or town who are duly qualified for voting under\r\nsection 12 of this article, and who have paid all taxes, State, county,\r\nmunicipal, for the previous year, shall be allowed to vote, and the\r\nvote of a majority of those voting in said elections shall be necessary\r\nto authorize the issue of said bonds.\r\n\r\nSEC. 14. Electors shall in all cases except treason, felony or breach\r\nof peace, be privileged from arrest on the days of election during\r\ntheir attendance at the polls and going and returning therefrom.\r\n\r\nSEC. 15. No power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to\r\nprevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage in this State.\r\n\r\nThe Convention having under consideration the Legislative Department\r\nOrdinance, when Section 34 was reached, which reads:\r\n\r\n“The marriage of white persons with a Negro or a mulatto, or person who\r\nshall have one-eighth or more of Negro blood, shall be unlawful and\r\nvoid;”\r\n\r\nhe proposed an amendment adding after the word “void” in the second\r\nline, the words “and any white person who lives and cohabits with a\r\nNegro, mulatto, or person who shall have one-eighth or more of Negro\r\nblood, shall be disqualified from holding any office of emolument or\r\ntrust in this State, and the offspring of any such living or cohabiting\r\nshall bear the name of the father, and shall be entitled to inherit and\r\nacquire property the same as if they were legitimate.” He then spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“MR. PRESIDENT: I hope this amendment will be adopted. Sir, there\r\nis not a colored man or woman of any respectability, not only in\r\nSouth Carolina, but in the whole country, that does not oppose the\r\nintermarriage of the races. There are very few, if any exceptions, in\r\nSouth Carolina, where a white man ever married a respectable colored\r\nwoman or a colored man married a respectable white woman. The facts in\r\nthe case are, that the white woman that marries a Negro man as a rule\r\nhas been an outcast by her race, and the colored woman that marries a\r\nwhite man, has no standing with the respectable women of her race, and\r\nthe white man no better with his. I cannot see why you want to prevent\r\nthe intermarriage of the races, when they want to legitimize their\r\nactions, unless you adopt my amendment, prohibiting the cohabitation\r\nof the white men with the Negro women. Mr. President, and gentlemen of\r\nthis Convention let me give you a little statistic, showing you, if it\r\nis possible, to do so, the wrongs you, or your fore-fathers have done\r\nto my race. Let us stop it, if we can; I fear not, but let us put it in\r\nthe fundamental laws of this State.\r\n\r\n“The number of Americans of African descent, wholly and in part,\r\nreturned to the census bureau in 1890 was 7,470,035. These were divided\r\nas follows: Pure Africans, 6,337,980; mulattoes 956,987; quadroons,\r\n105,132; octoroons, 69,936. The total mixed bloods, white and black,\r\nwas 1,132,060 in the whole country, and a third of these are above the\r\nMason and Dixon line.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, a careful perusal of the census, also history, shows\r\nthat more than three-fourths of the mothers of this large number of\r\nmixed blood whom you seek to legislate against, are colored women, if\r\nso, who could have been their fathers? Do not any of you rise and deny\r\nthis, because I am no lawyer, but know enough about it that I cannot\r\nimpeach my own witness. A careful perusal of the census, also shows in\r\nthe State, that this one-fourth that lives beyond Mason and Dixon’s\r\nline shows fully that three-fourths of the one-fourth of the mixed\r\nblood were born in the Southern States. So you see, gentlemen, you are\r\nresponsible for the wrongs that have been done; let us in the name of\r\nGod, and in behalf of virtue, try and put a stop to this cohabitation.\r\nI could but admire a few days ago, when the gentlemen upon this floor\r\nspoke so highly of the women of this State, I am mindful of the fact\r\nthat when they spoke of the women of this State that they spoke of\r\nthe white women. I can but echo their sentiment, and do say, that I\r\nbelieve them to be as pure women as can be found anywhere in the world.\r\nI have not been strongly in favor of female suffrage, but since your\r\ndiscussion on the Divorce Law I feel I shall have to vote for the\r\nsuffrage in order that they may pass a law or laws that will make\r\nyou as pure as they are. We have, sir, as pure colored women in South\r\nCarolina and in this country, as any race upon this earth. Sir, that\r\nevil, known as slavery caused all of this. This wrong was done by you\r\nall, owning them as your slaves. Sir, no act of yours will prevent a\r\nwhite man from marrying a colored woman or a colored man from marrying\r\na white woman, who have the means to go in another State. There are\r\nmany States in the Union, that do not prevent them marrying and they\r\ncan go and get married and you cannot help yourself. I have in my mind\r\ndistinctly, a colored man and a white woman who were in love with each\r\nother, and who wanted to get married, but this man recited to her the\r\nlaw on your Statute book that prohibited the intermarriage of the\r\nraces. This lady stated that there were no such laws in the district of\r\nColumbia, New York or Massachusetts. She was as pure a lady as there\r\nis. I only cite this because it is a matter that you cannot control\r\nexcept directly in the State. This entire matter, sir, has no right in\r\nthe Constitution of the State, if your women are as pure as you stated,\r\nand I have reason to believe that they are, they can be trusted; then\r\nwhy the necessity of this being placed in the Constitution? Can you not\r\ntrust yourselves? Is it because that these wrongs have been perpetrated\r\nhere, since the formation of the Government, that you feel that you\r\ncan’t be trusted? When I say you, I mean the white men of the entire\r\nState. I fear not; hence I trust the amendment will be adopted. These\r\nwrongs have been done, and are still being done, it is not done by\r\ncolored men, it is done by white men. If a Negro should improperly\r\napproach a white woman, his body would be hanging on the nearest tree\r\nfilled with air holes before daylight the next morning--and perhaps\r\nproperly so. If the same rule were applied on the other side, and white\r\nmen who insulted or debauched Negro women were treated likewise, this\r\nConvention would have to be adjourned sine die for lack of a quorum.\r\n\r\n“The gentleman called me to order stating that I had reflected on the\r\nConvention. I do not wish to reflect on the Convention. I do not wish\r\nto reflect on the Convention, but do say, that if he has clean hands\r\nhe will keep his seat, because I do not mean to reflect on any man who\r\nobjects to the intermarriage of a Negro or Mulatto woman with a white\r\nman, and is willing to prohibit the cohabitation, which is the root\r\nand branch of this evil. Stop this evil, and there will be no occasion\r\nfor your intermarriage law. Sir, I oppose the intermarriage of the\r\nraces as strongly as you do, and I feel that I echo the sentiment of\r\nthe respectable class of both sides; because with few exceptions, we\r\nfind these marriages are among the lower element of both races, and,\r\ntherefore, they degrade and not elevate either race. But sir, don’t\r\ntell me that you will make a law to prevent lawful marriages and give\r\nfull license to illicit marriages. Watch the census of each decade,\r\nyou will clearly see that this vice is decreasing among our people; as\r\nthey are progressing educationally they are raising themselves out of\r\nthis degradation, that your race has placed upon them. Now sir, I say,\r\nprohibit intermarriage of the races, also make a law as binding against\r\ncohabitation. Then you will make your men as true as your women. And\r\nour race will be freed from a vice, that is as degrading as the system\r\nof slavery. Again sir, in behalf of my race, I hope that the amendment\r\nto the section under consideration will be adopted and become a part of\r\nthe Constitution of the State.”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of this amendment caused a great deal of discussion,\r\nwhich showed plainly that South Carolina had no idea of punishing white\r\nmen for wrong done to colored women, nor would she allow the wrong to\r\nbe rectified, and the original Section 34 was adopted, and is now the\r\nfundamental law of the State.\r\n\r\nOn page (20-22) we have selected two editorials on this amendment, also\r\na telegram on page 23.\r\n\r\nThe following is clipped from Section 6 on Education. There are in this\r\nState several thousand soldiers who fought for the perpetuity of the\r\nUnion, yet they are compelled to pay the poll tax ten years longer than\r\nthese who sought to destroy it.\r\n\r\n“There shall be assessed on all taxable polls in the State between\r\nthe ages of 21 and 60 years (excepting Confederate soldiers above the\r\nage of 50 years) an annual tax of $1 on each poll, the proceeds of\r\nwhich tax shall be expended for school purposes in the several school\r\ndistricts in which it is collected.”\r\n\r\nClaflin College was advocated for colored students, taught by Negroes;\r\nthe best, wherever they could be found, should be secured.\r\n\r\nThe committee on order, style and revision had the work ready, and\r\nall that was needed was the signature of the members to make the\r\nConstitution final. The members went up in county delegations and\r\nsigned the new organic law.\r\n\r\nPresident Evans and Vice President Jones signed the new Constitution as\r\nthe officers present, and then came Abbeville and the other counties on\r\ndown. When Beaufort was reached, Delegate Smalls asked to be excused\r\nfrom signing the Constitution, as he would not sign a Constitution with\r\nsuch an article on suffrage. He was unanimously excused. He was the\r\nonly member of the Beaufort delegation present.\r\n\r\nSome one during the progress of the signing sent up a resolution that\r\nmembers not signing the Constitution should not be paid. Gen. Smalls\r\nsaid he would walk home rather than sign the instrument. President\r\nEvans did not press the resolution, and members generally thought\r\nlightly of the matter, and it was not even put to the Convention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDITORIAL FROM THE (N. Y.) PRESS, OCT. 5, 1895.\r\n\r\nWe can recall no more brilliant moral victory of a parliamentary\r\nminority than that gained on Thursday in the South Carolina\r\nConstitutional Convention by the representatives of the race about to\r\nbe disfranchised for lack of intelligence wherewith to vote. In so\r\ncharacterizing the attack of these black delegates we have in mind the\r\nextraordinary ends accomplished with minorities by Mr. Randall, Mr.\r\nBlaine and Mr. Reed, the chief parliamentarians of our generation.\r\n\r\nIn this case the white majority laid themselves open to the flank\r\nmovement, which Robert Smalls had evidently meditated throughout\r\nthe session, by introducing a quite supererogatory article for the\r\namendment of mixed marriages. The black leader instantly moved an\r\namendment providing that illicit as well as legal unions between the\r\nraces should be prohibited. He proposed to disqualify all men--and\r\nthis of course would mean only white men--who were parties to such\r\nunions. He proposed that the offspring of such unions should take their\r\nfathers’ names.\r\n\r\nSenator Tillman, who seems, though the author of this new secession of\r\nSouth Carolina, to be the only man in the Convention who appreciates\r\nin the slightest degree the effect of its actions upon outside public\r\nopinion, proceeded at once to save his record by espousing the Negro\r\ncause. He cut himself loose promptly from the majority in the course\r\ninto which he knew its provincial ignorance would direct it. He went so\r\nfar as roundly to berate his own chairman for his attempt to choke off\r\nthe plea of the black men for the integrity of black women.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly a debate that followed. It was an arraignment which\r\nculminated when Mr. Smalls, after approving the punishment which lynch\r\nlaw has meted out to the worst offenders of his race, said:\r\n\r\n“If the same rule were applied on the other side and white men were\r\ntreated likewise, I fear this Convention would have to be adjourned for\r\nlack of a quorum.”\r\n\r\nThe “burst of laughter” which followed this threw an interesting light\r\non the morals and manners of South Carolina. It showed the state of\r\ncivilization depicted in “Tom Jones.” A Convention composed entirely\r\nof Squire Westerns would have met such an impeachment in a precisely\r\nsimilar way. Having satisfied their sense of humor the delegates killed\r\nthe amendment and passed the mixed marriages article.\r\n\r\nThis seizure of a parliamentary advantage in so sudden and effective a\r\nmanner as to cause the majority leader to abandon his forces and leave\r\nthem to expose their moral nakedness to the world was more than equal\r\nto Mr. Blaine’s rout of the Rebel Brigadiers in the famous Amnesty\r\nDebate. For those gentry managed to fan and sponge Ben Hill into the\r\nring again, and these remained “out of time.”\r\n\r\nAnd in no one other way could the Negroes have so convincingly proved\r\nto the world their right to the ballot than by this victory of black\r\nmind over white matter. It is now made plain, as it was made plain by\r\nthe first laws passed by the unreconstructed Legislature of the same\r\nState after the war, that the fear of Negro domination is not born so\r\nmuch of a regard for the numbers as for the developed intellectual\r\nability of the blacks. It is not Negro ignorance, but Negro\r\nintelligence, that is feared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDITORIAL FROM THE NEWS AND COURIER, THE LEADING DEMOCRATIC PAPER OF\r\nCHARLESTON, S. C., Nov. 23, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe troublesome matter of miscegenation was settled finally by the\r\nadoption of the provision that “the marriage of a white person with a\r\nNegro or mulatto, or person who shall have one-eighth of Negro blood,\r\nshall be unlawful and void” hereafter. The provision would have been\r\nstrengthened and improved by the adoption of Gen. Smalls’ proposed\r\naddition to it that “any white person who lives and cohabits with\r\nsuch persons should be disqualified from holding office of emolument\r\nor trust in this State, and the offspring of such living or cohabiting\r\nshall bear the name of the father,” but the Convention rejected the\r\naddition by the largest vote recorded recently. Its action was a\r\nmistake. The addition was a proper corollary to the section adopted,\r\nand should have been extended to disqualify from voting, as well as\r\nholding office, the class of offenders at which it was aimed. Of the\r\ntwo offences--miscegenation within the marriage bond and miscegenation\r\nwithout it--the latter is the greater social evil. It should have been\r\ntreated accordingly. The action of the Convention in this instance\r\nand its action of the preceding day in reducing the age of consent to\r\nthe limits of childhood will inevitably be construed together to the\r\ninjury and reproach to the State. Both decisions should not stand.\r\nTaken together they offer a premium for a condition of affairs which\r\nis condemned alike by every dictate of sound morals and of the public\r\nsentiment of the State. Miscegenation is contrary to the law of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOSTON, MASS., Oct. 16, 1895.\r\n\r\n  To the Hon. Robert Smalls, Columbia, S.

C.:\r\n\r\nMy Dear General--I am very desirous of procuring a copy of each one of\r\nthe speeches delivered in your Convention at Columbia on the suffrage\r\nquestion. If you have within easy reach any or all of them in print,\r\nI shall esteem it as a favor if you will kindly forward to me here\r\nsuch of them as you can readily spare. And let me say to you, my dear\r\nGeneral, what has, I presume, been said to you already, that the\r\ndignity, courage and signal ability with which you and your Republican\r\ncolleagues at Columbia, have asserted and maintained manhood rights and\r\nthe just claims of all citizens to fair play under the supreme law of\r\nthe land as well as under the civilization of our times, have touched\r\nthe heart of the great North and called forth its soberest approval and\r\nits high admiration.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is felt here that, in your statements, your arguments and\r\nwarnings, you have covered the whole case and done lasting honor to the\r\nNegro race and to American patriotism. All hail to you and your noble\r\nband of Spartans at Columbia!\r\n\r\n  Yours very sincerely,\r\n  E. C. BOSSETT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  NEWBERRY, Oct. 28, 1895.\r\n  Hon. Robert Smalls:\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I take the liberty of expressing to you and through you\r\nto your colleagues, Messrs. Miller, Wigg and Whipper my very great\r\ngratification and approval of your and their very able and eloquent\r\naddresses in behalf of sound Republican principles, of justice towards\r\nall classes, and of fair and honest elections. You all did credit\r\nto your race, to the Republican party, and as I hope and believe\r\nto the cause of justice, for I have no doubt your efforts will\r\nhave great influence outside the State. The prompt voting down of\r\neverything proposed, however fair and moderate, looked very much like\r\npre-concerted action, and was not creditable to the Convention, either\r\nConservatives or “Reformers.” But I should say, keep up the fight at\r\nevery point along the line. Propose amendments to every objectionable\r\nsection, even if they are voted down.\r\n\r\n  Very Respectfully,\r\n  B. O. DUNCAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ADELPHI HOTEL,           }\r\n  LIVERPOOL, Oct. 6, 1895. }\r\n\r\n  Mr. Robert Smalls, Beaufort, S. C.:\r\n\r\nDear Sir--We have read over here the telegraphic report about the\r\nmetaphorical bomb you threw into the Constitutional Convention, with\r\nthe greatest glee. But not only was it the best sort of fuse--it was\r\nloaded, too, with the most explosive truth, (it seems to have scattered\r\nthe ladies.) Such jokes as yours make an entrance for the truth when\r\ncold logic slides off like water from a duck’s back. Gen. Ben Butler’s\r\nphrase about the contraband of war converted more Democrats than\r\nSeward’s great speeches. And so I doubt not your “little joke” will do\r\nmore to make the scales drop from people’s eyes than even Douglass’\r\nadmirable tract “Why is the Negro Lynched;” (Of this I will try to\r\nsend you a copy.) Butler’s “Contraband” prepared the way for Lincoln’s\r\nEmancipation Proclamation. Your resolution, so aptly timed, I regard\r\nas one of those _immense_ things that influence destiny. I do not know\r\nhow much it will be written about in the papers, but I believe it is\r\nonly second in the importance of its influence to Uncle Tom’s Cabin,\r\nbecause of its _opportuneness_. _No occasion could have occurred--none\r\ncan again occur_--when that truth wrapped up in the words of your\r\namendment could have reached home to the American people--could have\r\npenetrated the harness and armor of the late Rebel master. More than\r\nthat, you have prepared the way for one of the greatest books on the\r\nrelations of the Negro and the mulatto to the white race. I speak,\r\nof course, of Mr. Keeper’s book, “Minden Armies.” At once on reading\r\nyour action and its result in the Convention, I wrote an article,\r\nintended to be light and attractive, and took it to one of the great\r\nLondon dailies, but it was returned as the subject was hardly of enough\r\nconsequence to their constituency, their columns being so crowded. I\r\nshould be very glad to have the best report of that meeting that is\r\npublished, as I want to see the details in full. Address me.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n  HORACE J. SMITH,\r\n  44 Grosvenor Road, London S. W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIAL TO THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA, S. C., Sept. 30--Five of the six Negro delegates to the South\r\nCarolina Constitutional Convention, which proposes to disfranchise the\r\nblacks, have joined in the following address to the North, through The\r\nWorld:\r\n\r\n  To the Editor of the World:\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Constitutional Convention called in South Carolina is\r\nin session. It has been called for the purpose of dealing with the\r\nNegro problem. Those who have advocated its assembling have been\r\nexplicit in their declaration of the purposes to be accomplished--the\r\ndisfranchisement of the Negro and the elimination of him entirely,\r\nnot from a participation in elections, for he has not since 1886 had\r\nany show at all in any of the elections held in the State, but of\r\nthe possibility of the Negro uniting with the conservative Democratic\r\nfaction and thus oust from place and power those now in control of\r\nthe Government. The chief obstacle in the way of accomplishing what\r\nis desired is the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Federal\r\nConstitution. This difficulty removed, there will be plain sailing.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Benjamin Ryan Tillman, who is the head and front of the\r\nmovement, has not been at all politic or hypocritical as to his\r\nintentions. He has said that his object is to disfranchise as many\r\nNegroes as he possibly can without disfranchising a single white man,\r\nexcept for crime.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE CENSUS SHOWS.\r\n\r\nIn the State, according to the census of the United States, taken in\r\n1890, there were: Negroes over twenty-one years of age, 132,949; whites\r\nover twenty-one years of age, 102,567; Negro majority, 30,292. Of these\r\nare illiterate, 58,086 Negroes and 13,242 whites. Now, it will plainly\r\nbe seen that a purely educational qualification, honestly administered,\r\nwould give the whites 89,415, and the Negroes 74,851 votes; white\r\nmajority, 14,564 votes.\r\n\r\nBut the nut for Tillman to crack is how he can disfranchise the\r\nNegro without disfranchising the 13,242 illiterate whites, whose\r\nvotes would be lost entirely to his faction should the conservative\r\nelement nominate and vote an independent ticket. The highest vote\r\nhis faction has ever been able to poll in round numbers is 60,000,\r\nand the Conservatives 35,000. If Tillman’s faction, therefore,\r\nshould lose 13,242 votes it would leave him only 46,758 votes, and\r\nthe Conservatives 35,000 votes, and Tillman’s majority over the\r\nConservatives would be only 11,758 votes.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that the 74,851 Negro votes or any\r\nconsiderable part of them uniting with the Conservatives would make\r\nthat faction master of the situation, and that is what Tillman wants to\r\nprevent. He has thus far hypnotized the whites of both factions With\r\nthe scarecrow, “White supremacy,” which he has shaken in their faces\r\non every occasion, and which he is shrewd enough to know has the same\r\neffect upon the whites as a red flag has upon an enraged bull.\r\n\r\nTILLMAN’S SUFFRAGE PLAN.\r\n\r\nThe real truth is that “white supremacy” has never been endangered;\r\nfor even in the days of Republican ascendancy all the great offices,\r\nand a large majority of all the offices, were held by white men, and\r\nno one ever thought of making it a Negro government. The suffrage\r\nplan, as we have been informed, as agreed upon by the committee, is as\r\nfollows: Every male citizen twenty-one years of age who has not been\r\nconvicted of crime, and is not an idiot or an inmate of a prison or\r\na charitable institution, who can read a section of the Constitution\r\nto the satisfaction of the officers of election, or who can explain\r\nsaid section when read to him to the satisfaction of said officers, or\r\nwho pays taxes on $500 worth of real property; or who can satisfy the\r\nelection officers that he has paid all taxes due by him to the State,\r\nand who shall be duly registered according to law, shall be entitled to\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these provisions, as simple and just as they appear, when\r\nread by the uninitiated, are freighted with fraud, corruption and\r\nprostitution of the suffrage. For the officers of election are the sole\r\njudges of the qualification of the elector, and can at their will make\r\nthe Negro vote or the white vote as large or as small as they choose.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS OF FRAUD.\r\n\r\nEveryone of these innocent little “ors” is the instrument of and\r\ncontains infinite possibilities of fraud, and in the hands of election\r\nofficers, all of whom are members of one party and of the same faction,\r\nare construed to mean one thing to one set of voters and another thing\r\nto another set, when they offer to register.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Creelman has explained in his dispatches, the registration\r\nofficer and his board will have the sole power to make voters in South\r\nCarolina, as the Supreme Court of the State has decided that there is\r\nno appeal to any Court of law from the acts of election officers. In\r\nshort, the Convention has been called to legalize the frauds which have\r\nbeen perpetrated upon the elective franchise in this State since 1876.\r\nNo one can tell or estimate what the vote will be, and that question\r\ncan be answered only by the election officers.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT SMALLS,\r\n  THOMAS E.
