But in this sense he is known chiefly as the “Rough Rider”\r\nof the Santiago campaign; whereas those who read these books will see\r\nthat his experience as a volunteer officer in the war with Spain is\r\nonly one incident in a life which has been singularly varied in thought\r\nand accomplishment and useful in many fields.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt was born in New York City, October 27, 1858. On his father’s\r\nside he is descended from a Dutch emigrant of the seventeenth century\r\nand the intermediate generations have been prudent, hard-working,\r\nsuccessful merchants, prominent at all times in the commercial and\r\nsocial life of New York. His father’s mother was from Pennsylvania,\r\nof Irish stock. His own mother was from Georgia, a daughter of James\r\nDunwoodie Bullock, whose family was of Scotch and Huguenot origin, and\r\nhad been prominent in public life in the South.\r\n\r\nDuring his childhood, Roosevelt was in such bad health that it was\r\ndoubtful if he would ever grow to manhood, and his robust strength\r\nand extraordinary capacity for physical endurance were not acquired\r\nuntil after his outdoor life in the West. He was educated at private\r\nschools in New York City, whence he went to Harvard University in\r\n1876, graduating in the usual course in 1880. His tastes were for\r\nliterary work, but the very year after leaving college he was elected\r\nto the Legislature as a representative of one of the City Assembly\r\ndistricts; and in the same fashion that has since characterized him,\r\nhe plunged at once into the thick of the fight as an ardent reformer,\r\nparticularly with reference to legislation affecting New York City.\r\nHis youth and lack of experience were more than counterbalanced by his\r\nearnestness and aggressive energy, so that he speedily became a power\r\nwhich had to be recognized. He was the leader of his party while it\r\nwas in the minority, and when it was in the majority he was Chairman\r\nof the Committee on Cities. He served three terms in the Legislature,\r\nand during that time introduced and carried through more important city\r\nlegislation than was ever brought about by any one assemblyman. It was\r\nall directed by one central purpose, namely, to put an end to boards\r\nand commissions with their opportunities for “trades” and “deals,” to\r\nrestrict the powers of the Board of Aldermen, who were notoriously\r\ncorrupt, and to concentrate responsibility in the Mayor and single\r\nheads of departments, who could be held accountable; in other words,\r\nto effect the transformation from what was suitable for town-meeting\r\ngovernment in New England or New Holland one or two centuries ago to\r\nwhat was required for the complicated cosmopolitan metropolis of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Legislature he still found time for literary work, and\r\nin 1882 wrote _The Naval War of 1812_, which told the story of our\r\nglorious successes on the sea; it was written at a period when our\r\nmerchant marine was in decadence, our navy at its lowest ebb, and\r\npublic interest in the subject almost wholly lost. It was not without\r\nits effect on the rebuilding of the navy which began two years\r\nlater, which fortunately for us had already reached such a splendid\r\ndevelopment before 1898, and which is still in progress.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, severe domestic affliction and ill-health caused Roosevelt\r\nto abandon his work in New York and go to Wyoming. He invested a\r\nconsiderable part of what he inherited from his father in a cattle\r\nranch, and intended and expected to remain in the West for many years.\r\nThe wild, outdoor life fascinated him, and it brought him health and\r\nstrength; in spite of defective eyesight, he became a good shot, and\r\nwas particularly fond of hunting big game--where the other fellow had\r\nan even chance; and the peculiar characteristics of the cowboy, since\r\ncalled cow-puncher, appealed alike to his sense of humor and his love\r\nof fair play. After he returned to live in the East, his fondness for\r\nhunting took him to the plains or mountains for his vacation every\r\nyear; and his hunting experiences are charmingly described in two\r\nvolumes, _Hunting Trips of a Ranchman_ (1885) and _The Wilderness\r\nHunter_ (1893). Senator Wolcott, in his speech notifying Roosevelt of\r\nhis nomination for the Vice-Presidency, playfully referred to these\r\nhunting stories with the remark that “now that you are our candidate\r\nthey will all be believed”; but anyone who enjoys or admires manly\r\nsport--such as requires courage, endurance, hardship, and a contest\r\nwith animals which are superior to man in strength or speed--will take\r\nthe stories on faith, regardless of political belief.\r\n\r\nCattle raising did not prove financially successful, though Roosevelt\r\nkept his ranch until 1896. He returned to New York in 1886, married\r\nagain, and once more plunged into political life. A mayor of New\r\nYork was to be elected that year. Abram S. Hewitt had received the\r\nnomination from Tammany Hall and other Democrats; Henry George was\r\nthe candidate of the Socialists; the Republican party decided to put\r\nforward a candidate, and selected Roosevelt. There was but little\r\nchance of his election, but he made a most energetic canvass, speaking\r\nin three or four places every night during the latter part of the\r\ncampaign. Hewitt was elected, George being second, and Roosevelt third,\r\nwith a vote of about 60,000 out of a total of 220,000.\r\n\r\nThe next three years were devoted almost wholly to literary and\r\nhistorical work. The upbuilding of the great West is one of the great\r\nworld movements, in some respects the most important fact of the\r\ncentury now closing. Roosevelt began writing the story of it in 1886,\r\nunder the title of _The Winning of the West_; the first two volumes\r\nappearing in 1889, the third in 1894, and the fourth in 1896. Each\r\nvolume describes a distinct period and is complete in itself. The last\r\ncarried the story through the Louisiana Purchase. The history has been\r\ninterrupted by the Spanish War and the engrossing duties of the office\r\nof Governor of New York; but it is hoped that the leisure hours of a\r\nVice-President and the facilities of the libraries in Washington will\r\nafford the time and opportunity for its completion. Readers of the four\r\nvolumes already published will understand the reasons why Roosevelt\r\nhas such an extraordinary hold upon the sentiment and sympathy of the\r\nWestern people. They will see that, although born and bred in the great\r\ncity of the East, he realizes that the bone and sinew of this country,\r\nits strength and the sources of its wealth, are in the wide valley\r\nbetween the Alleghanies and the Rocky Mountains. Its origin and growth\r\nhave been studied by him in every detail; he has participated enough\r\nin its life thoroughly to understand it, and he is in close touch and\r\naccord with its aspirations for the future.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, Roosevelt was appointed by President Harrison a member of the\r\nCivil Service Commission at Washington and soon became its president,\r\nretaining that office until the spring of 1895. A thorough believer\r\nin the principle of merit instead of favor in selecting and promoting\r\nappointees for the thousands of minor offices in the public service,\r\nhe entered with his usual combativeness upon the task of enforcing the\r\nlaw for carrying this principle into effect. For six years, under his\r\nguidance, this was a fighting commission, not hesitating to grapple\r\nwith any Cabinet officer or members of Congress, irrespective of their\r\nparty affiliations, who tried to nullify or repeal the law. The result\r\nwas the extension of the Civil Service rules to more than 50,000\r\ngovernment employés who were not protected by them in 1889.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 there was a union of all parties in New York City who were\r\nopposed to Tammany Hall, and W. L. Strong was elected Mayor. He invited\r\nRoosevelt to join his administration as head of one of the departments;\r\nfirst, as head of the Street-Cleaning Department, which he declined\r\nfor lack of special knowledge; and second, as head of the Police\r\nDepartment, which he accepted. Some of his friends in Washington urged\r\nhim not to accept the place on the ground that it was beneath his\r\ndignity; others urged him with even more vehemence to accept it, partly\r\nbecause of the good work he could do for New York in putting this\r\ndepartment on an honest basis, and partly because of the opportunity\r\nit would afford him of getting on the firing-line in the contest for\r\ngood government in cities. He held this office for two years, and\r\nthough subjected to much criticism from certain quarters for enforcing\r\nthe liquor-license law, yet it can be said, in a word, that during\r\nhis administration he placed the department on a thoroughly efficient\r\nbasis, broke up the organized system of blackmail which had hitherto\r\nprevailed in the department, and gained the affectionate admiration of\r\nthe members of the force to an extent which has never been equalled by\r\nany Police Commissioner before or since.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years from 1894 to 1897 he wrote the greater part of\r\nthe essays on political subjects which are printed in the volumes of\r\n_American Ideals_. In these will be found his whole theory of politics,\r\nbased on honesty, courage, never-ending hard work, and fair play; and\r\ncoupled with these a certain measure of expediency which, without\r\nsacrificing principle, strives to get things done, and to accept the\r\nsecond best if what he considers the first best is not attainable;\r\nrealizing that in a government of universal suffrage many minds must be\r\nconsulted and a majority of them brought to the same conclusion before\r\nanything can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhen President McKinley took office in 1897, he offered Roosevelt\r\nthe position of Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and it was promptly\r\naccepted. He had been only a few months in office before he reached\r\ncertain conclusions, to wit: that a war with Spain was inevitable, that\r\nit was desirable, and that he should take an active part in it. He\r\ndid everything that lay in his power during the nine months preceding\r\nApril, 1898, to see that the Navy was prepared for the struggle, and\r\nhow well he succeeded the officers of Dewey’s and Sampson’s fleets and\r\nthe Bureau Chiefs in the Navy Department are always abundantly able and\r\nwilling to testify to. As war drew near he began to make his plans\r\nfor his own part in it. He at first endeavored to obtain a commission\r\nin one of the National Guard regiments in New York which he felt sure\r\nwould volunteer for the war, but this for various reasons being not\r\npracticable, he determined to raise a regiment of volunteer cavalry in\r\nthe West. His friends in Washington did everything to dissuade him from\r\nthis project: his wife was ill, his little children were dependent on\r\nhim, and it was urged that he could render far more valuable service in\r\nthe Navy Department than in the field. But his purpose was inflexible.\r\nOn account of his lack of experience in technical military details,\r\nhe asked his friend, Dr. Leonard Wood, an army surgeon who had had\r\nmuch experience in Indian fighting in Arizona, to take the position\r\nof Colonel, he taking that of Lieutenant-Colonel. He persuaded the\r\nPresident to authorize the raising of the 1st U. S. Volunteer Cavalry\r\non this basis. In about thirty days from the issuing of this authority\r\nthe regiment was recruited, uniformed, drilled, armed, equipped, and\r\ntransported to Tampa, Florida, ready for duty. The story of the Rough\r\nRiders is a household word from Maine to Arizona and from Oregon to\r\nFlorida. As told by Roosevelt himself, it has been read by millions of\r\nreaders. It is the most picturesque story in our military annals. In\r\nthe first skirmish, after landing on Cuban soil, Wood was promoted to\r\nthe rank of Brigadier-General, and Roosevelt was left in command of the\r\nregiment. It owed its origin to him, and he was associated with it\r\nfrom start to finish.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1898, the Republican State Convention met to nominate\r\na candidate for Governor of New York. Roosevelt was then with his\r\nregiment at Montauk Point, about to be mustered out of service. He was\r\nnominated, and at once entered upon a vigorous campaign. The party was\r\nthen suffering from criticism on account of its alleged mismanagement\r\nof the canals, and in the opinion of the best judges any other\r\ncandidate would have been defeated. Roosevelt was elected by about\r\n20,000 majority.\r\n\r\nHis election was doubtless due to his services in the war with Spain,\r\nbut these contributed little or nothing to his qualifications for the\r\noffice. These were found in his experience in the State Legislature,\r\nin the Civil Service Commission, the Police Department, and the Navy\r\nDepartment, an experience which had given him an intimate knowledge of\r\nthe practical working of municipal, state, and national governments;\r\nand above all, to his fearless honesty and tireless energy in devotion\r\nto sound principles of administration. During his two years of office\r\nas Governor, he has set a standard which the people of New York will\r\nnot soon allow to be lowered. He has put through a first-class Civil\r\nService law, he has framed and carried through legislation in regard\r\nto the difficult question of taxation, based on a new principle which\r\nis perfectly equitable, is particularly suited to modern conditions,\r\nand when modified in details to such extent as experience shall\r\ndemonstrate to be necessary will be accepted by all; he has honestly\r\nand economically administered the canals, and has caused the canal\r\nquestion to be carefully studied so as to bring out all the essential\r\nfacts upon which its solution must be based; he has resolutely refused\r\nto appoint any unfit man to office, although usually ready to accept\r\na suitable man when recommended by the Republican organization, which\r\nincludes the greater part of the voters in the party; he has appointed\r\ncommissions to study the educational system, the tenement-house\r\nquestion, and a revision of the Charter of the great city of New York.\r\nHis appointees, from top to bottom, have been of the very highest type;\r\nfrom the foundation of the State there have been no higher.\r\n\r\nMany of his measures are in a half-finished condition. The Republicans\r\nof New York would, beyond question, have renominated and re-elected\r\nhim to carry them to completion. But at this stage the Republicans of\r\nthe United States with singular unanimity have called him away from\r\nNew York, against his personal wishes and judgment, to take part in\r\nnational affairs and to aid President McKinley in carrying out those\r\npolicies which during the last four years have brought such prosperity\r\nat home and such greatness abroad. He has yielded his judgment to\r\ntheirs, and cheerfully accepted the call.\r\n\r\nHe has six children--Alice Lee, Theodore, Kermit, Ethel Carow,\r\nArchibald Bullock, and Quentin. His home is at Sagamore Hill, Oyster\r\nBay, Long Island.\r\n\r\nIn these pages the people of this land can read the thoughts that have\r\nbeen spun out by his brain during the last eighteen years, and can see\r\nwhat manner of man he is. They believe him to be honest, fearless,\r\nstraightforward, a tireless worker, experienced in the administration\r\nof city, state, and national affairs, a careful student and writer of\r\nhis country’s history, an American in every fibre, a man who holds his\r\nlife at his country’s service whenever a war is on during his lifetime.\r\nIn reading these books their belief in him will be justified and\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\n                                                      FRANCIS V. GREENE.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, July 16, 1900.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to be virtuous in a cloistered and negative way.\r\nNeither is it difficult to succeed, after a fashion, in active life,\r\nif one is content to disregard the considerations which bind honorable\r\nand upright men. But it is by no means easy to combine honesty and\r\nefficiency; and yet it is absolutely necessary, in order to do any work\r\nreally worth doing. It is not hard, while sitting in one’s study, to\r\ndevise admirable plans for the betterment of politics and of social\r\nconditions; but in practice it too often proves very hard to make any\r\nsuch plan work at all, no matter how imperfectly. Yet the effort must\r\ncontinually be made, under penalty of constant retrogression in our\r\npolitical life.\r\n\r\nNo one quality or one virtue is enough to insure success; vigor,\r\nhonesty, common sense,--all are needed. The practical man is merely\r\nrendered more noxious by his practical ability if he employs it\r\nwrongly, whether from ignorance or from lack of morality; while the\r\ndoctrinaire, the man of theories, whether written or spoken, is useless\r\nif he cannot also act.\r\n\r\nThese essays are written on behalf of the many men who do take an\r\nactual part in trying practically to bring about the conditions for\r\nwhich we somewhat vaguely hope; on behalf of the under-officers in that\r\narmy which, with much stumbling, halting, and slipping, many mistakes\r\nand shortcomings, and many painful failures, does, nevertheless,\r\nthrough weary strife, accomplish something toward raising the standard\r\nof public life.\r\n\r\nWe feel that the doer is better than the critic and that the man who\r\nstrives stands far above the man who stands aloof, whether he thus\r\nstands aloof because of pessimism or because of sheer weakness. To\r\nborrow a simile from the football field, we believe that men must play\r\nfair, but that there must be no shirking, and that success can only\r\ncome to the player who “hits the line hard.”\r\n\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n                                                        SAGAMORE HILL,\r\n                                                        _October, 1897_.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                             PAGE\r\n\r\nI.--AMERICAN IDEALS                                                    1\r\n\r\nII.--TRUE AMERICANISM                                                 15\r\n\r\nIII.--THE MANLY VIRTUES AND PRACTICAL POLITICS                        35\r\n\r\nIV.--THE COLLEGE GRADUATE AND PUBLIC LIFE                             47\r\n\r\nV.--PHASES OF STATE LEGISLATION                                       63\r\n\r\nVI.--MACHINE POLITICS IN NEW YORK CITY                               102\r\n\r\nVII.--SIX YEARS OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM                              134\r\n\r\nVIII.--ADMINISTERING THE NEW YORK POLICE FORCE                       160\r\n\r\nIX.--THE VICE-PRESIDENCY AND THE CAMPAIGN OF 1896                    189\r\n\r\nX.--HOW NOT TO HELP OUR POORER BROTHER                               214\r\n\r\nXI.--THE MONROE DOCTRINE                                             228\r\n\r\nXII.--WASHINGTON’S FORGOTTEN MAXIM                                   247\r\n\r\nXIII.--NATIONAL LIFE AND CHARACTER                                   271\r\n\r\nXIV.--SOCIAL EVOLUTION                                               303\r\n\r\nXV.--THE LAW OF CIVILIZATION AND DECAY                               329\r\n\r\nXVI.--[1]REFORM THROUGH SOCIAL WORK                                  355\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Reprinted through the courtesy of the S.

It would be difficult to exaggerate the material effects\r\nof the careers of Washington and of Lincoln upon the United States.\r\nWithout Washington we should probably never have won our independence\r\nof the British crown, and we should almost certainly have failed to\r\nbecome a great nation, remaining instead a cluster of jangling little\r\ncommunities, drifting toward the type of government prevalent in\r\nSpanish America. Without Lincoln we might perhaps have failed to keep\r\nthe political unity we had won; and even if, as is possible, we had\r\nkept it, both the struggle by which it was kept and the results of this\r\nstruggle would have been so different that the effect upon our national\r\nhistory could not have failed to be profound. Yet the nation’s debt\r\nto these men is not confined to what it owes them for its material\r\nwell-being, incalculable though this debt is. Beyond the fact that we\r\nare an independent and united people, with half a continent as our\r\nheritage, lies the fact that every American is richer by the heritage\r\nof the noble deeds and noble words of Washington and of Lincoln. Each\r\nof us who reads the Gettysburg speech or the second inaugural address\r\nof the greatest American of the nineteenth century, or who studies\r\nthe long campaigns and lofty statesmanship of that other American who\r\nwas even greater, cannot but feel within him that lift toward things\r\nhigher and nobler which can never be bestowed by the enjoyment of mere\r\nmaterial prosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the country which these men helped to make and helped\r\nto save that is ours by inheritance; we inherit also all that is best\r\nand highest in their characters and in their lives. We inherit from\r\nLincoln and from the might of Lincoln’s generation not merely the\r\nfreedom of those who once were slaves; for we inherit also the fact of\r\nthe freeing of them, we inherit the glory and the honor and the wonder\r\nof the deed that was done, no less than the actual results of the deed\r\nwhen done. The bells that rang at the passage of the Emancipation\r\nProclamation still ring in Whittier’s ode; and as men think over the\r\nreal nature of the triumph then scored for humankind their hearts shall\r\never throb as they cannot over the greatest industrial success or over\r\nany victory won at a less cost than ours.\r\n\r\nThe captains and the armies who, after long years of dreary campaigning\r\nand bloody, stubborn fighting, brought to a close the Civil War have\r\nlikewise left us even more than a reunited realm. The material effect\r\nof what they did is shown in the fact that the same flag flies from\r\nthe Great Lakes to the Rio Grande, and all the people of the United\r\nStates are richer because they are one people and not many, because\r\nthey belong to one great nation and not to a contemptible knot of\r\nstruggling nationalities. But besides this, besides the material\r\nresults of the Civil War, we are all, North and South, incalculably\r\nricher for its memories. We are the richer for each grim campaign, for\r\neach hard-fought battle. We are the richer for valor displayed alike by\r\nthose who fought so valiantly for the right and by those who, no less\r\nvaliantly, fought for what they deemed the right. We have in us nobler\r\ncapacities for what is great and good because of the infinite woe and\r\nsuffering, and because of the splendid ultimate triumph.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that we are the better for the deeds of our mighty men\r\nwho have served the nation well, so we are the worse for the deeds and\r\nthe words of those who have striven to bring evil on the land. Most\r\nfortunately we have been free from the peril of the most dangerous\r\nof all examples. We have not had to fight the influence exerted over\r\nthe minds of eager and ambitious men by the career of the military\r\nadventurer who heads some successful revolutionary or separatist\r\nmovement. No man works such incalculable woe to a free country as\r\nhe who teaches young men that one of the paths to glory, renown,\r\nand temporal success lies along the line of armed resistance to the\r\nGovernment, of its attempted overthrow.\r\n\r\nYet if we are free from the peril of this example, there are other\r\nperils from which we are not free. All through our career we have had\r\nto war against a tendency to regard, in the individual and the nation\r\nalike, as most important, things that are of comparatively little\r\nimportance. We rightfully value success, but sometimes we overvalue\r\nit, for we tend to forget that success may be obtained by means which\r\nshould make it abhorred and despised by every honorable man. One\r\nsection of the community deifies as “smartness” the kind of trickery\r\nwhich enables a man without conscience to succeed in the financial\r\nor political world. Another section of the community deifies violent\r\nhomicidal lawlessness. If ever our people as a whole adopt these\r\nviews, then we shall have proved that we are unworthy of the heritage\r\nour forefathers left us; and our country will go down in ruin.\r\n\r\nThe people that do harm in the end are not the wrong-doers whom all\r\nexecrate; they are the men who do not do quite as much wrong, but who\r\nare applauded instead of being execrated. The career of Benedict Arnold\r\nhas done us no harm as a nation because of the universal horror it\r\ninspired. The men who have done us harm are those who have advocated\r\ndisunion, but have done it so that they have been enabled to keep their\r\npolitical position; who have advocated repudiation of debts, or other\r\nfinancial dishonesty, but have kept their standing in the community;\r\nwho preach the doctrines of anarchy, but refrain from action that will\r\nbring them within the pale of the law; for these men lead thousands\r\nastray by the fact that they go unpunished or even rewarded for their\r\nmisdeeds.\r\n\r\nIt is unhappily true that we inherit the evil as well as the good\r\ndone by those who have gone before us, and in the one case as in the\r\nother the influence extends far beyond the mere material effects. The\r\nfoes of order harm quite as much by example as by what they actually\r\naccomplish. So it is with the equally dangerous criminals of the\r\nwealthy classes. The conscienceless stock speculator who acquires\r\nwealth by swindling his fellows, by debauching judges and corrupting\r\nlegislatures, and who ends his days with the reputation of being among\r\nthe richest men in America, exerts over the minds of the rising\r\ngeneration an influence worse than that of the average murderer or\r\nbandit, because his career is even more dazzling in its success, and\r\neven more dangerous in its effects upon the community. Any one who\r\nreads the essays of Charles Francis Adams and Henry Adams, entitled\r\n“A Chapter of Erie,” and “The Gold Conspiracy in New York,” will read\r\nabout the doings of men whose influence for evil upon the community is\r\nmore potent than that of any band of anarchists or train robbers.\r\n\r\nThere are other members of our mercantile community who, being\r\nperfectly honest themselves, nevertheless do almost as much damage as\r\nthe dishonest. The professional labor agitator, with all his reckless\r\nincendiarism of speech, can do no more harm than the narrow, hard,\r\nselfish merchant or manufacturer who deliberately sets himself to\r\nkeep the laborers he employs in a condition of dependence which will\r\nrender them helpless to combine against him; and every such merchant or\r\nmanufacturer who rises to sufficient eminence leaves the record of his\r\nname and deeds as a legacy of evil to all who come after him.\r\n\r\nBut of course the worst foes of America are the foes to that orderly\r\nliberty without which our Republic must speedily perish. The reckless\r\nlabor agitator who arouses the mob to riot and bloodshed is in the last\r\nanalysis the most dangerous of the workingman’s enemies. This man is\r\na real peril; and so is his sympathizer, the legislator, who to catch\r\nvotes denounces the judiciary and the military because they put down\r\nmobs. We Americans have, on the whole, a right to be optimists; but it\r\nis mere folly to blind ourselves to the fact that there are some black\r\nclouds on the horizon of our future.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1894, every American capable of thinking must at\r\ntimes have pondered very gravely over certain features of the national\r\ncharacter which were brought into unpleasant prominence by the course\r\nof events. The demagogue, in all his forms, is as characteristic an\r\nevil of a free society as the courtier is of a despotism; and the\r\nattitude of many of our public men at the time of the great strike\r\nin July, 1894, was such as to call down on their heads the hearty\r\ncondemnation of every American who wishes well to his country. It\r\nwould be difficult to overestimate the damage done by the example and\r\naction of a man like Governor Altgeld of Illinois. Whether he is honest\r\nor not in his beliefs is not of the slightest consequence. He is as\r\nemphatically the foe of decent government as Tweed himself, and is\r\ncapable of doing far more damage than Tweed. The Governor, who began\r\nhis career by pardoning anarchists, and whose most noteworthy feat\r\nsince was his bitter and undignified, but fortunately futile, campaign\r\nagainst the election of the upright judge who sentenced the anarchists,\r\nis the foe of every true American and is the foe particularly of every\r\nhonest workingman. With such a man it was to be expected that he\r\nshould in time of civic commotion act as the foe of the law-abiding\r\nand the friend of the lawless classes, and endeavor, in company with\r\nthe lowest and most abandoned office-seeking politicians, to prevent\r\nproper measures being taken to prevent riot and to punish the rioters.\r\nHad it not been for the admirable action of the Federal Government,\r\nChicago would have seen a repetition of what occurred during the Paris\r\nCommune, while Illinois would have been torn by a fierce social war;\r\nand for all the horrible waste of life that this would have entailed\r\nGovernor Altgeld would have been primarily responsible. It was a\r\nmost fortunate thing that the action at Washington was so quick and\r\nso emphatic. Senator Davis of Minnesota set the key of patriotism at\r\nthe time when men were still puzzled and hesitated. The President and\r\nAttorney-General Olney acted with equal wisdom and courage, and the\r\ndanger was averted. The completeness of the victory of the Federal\r\nauthorities, representing the cause of law and order, has been perhaps\r\none reason why it was so soon forgotten; and now not a few shortsighted\r\npeople need to be reminded that when we were on the brink of an almost\r\nterrific explosion the governor of Illinois did his best to work to\r\nthis country a measure of harm as great as any ever planned by Benedict\r\nArnold, and that we were saved by the resolute action of the Federal\r\njudiciary and of the regular army. Moreover, Governor Altgeld, though\r\npre-eminent, did not stand alone on his unenviable prominence. Governor\r\nWaite of Colorado stood with him. Most of the Populist governors of\r\nthe Western States, and the Republican governor of California and the\r\nDemocratic governor of North Dakota, shared the shame with him; and\r\nit makes no difference whether in catering to riotous mobs they paid\r\nheed to their own timidity and weakness, or to that spirit of blatant\r\ndemagogism which, more than any other, jeopardizes the existence of\r\nfree institutions. On the other hand, the action of the then Governor\r\nof Ohio, Mr. McKinley, entitled him to the gratitude of all good\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nEvery true American, every man who thinks, and who if the occasion\r\ncomes is ready to act, may do well to ponder upon the evil wrought by\r\nthe lawlessness of the disorderly classes when once they are able to\r\nelect their own chiefs to power. If the Government generally got into\r\nthe hands of men such as Altgeld, the Republic would go to pieces in\r\na year; and it would be right that it should go to pieces, for the\r\nelection of such men shows that the people electing them are unfit to\r\nbe entrusted with self-government.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, plenty of wrong-doers besides those who commit\r\nthe overt act. Too much cannot be said against the men of wealth who\r\nsacrifice everything to getting wealth. There is not in the world a\r\nmore ignoble character than the mere money-getting American, insensible\r\nto every duty, regardless of every principle, bent only on amassing\r\na fortune, and putting his fortune only to the basest uses--whether\r\nthese uses be to speculate in stocks and wreck railroads himself, or\r\nto allow his son to lead a life of foolish and expensive idleness\r\nand gross debauchery, or to purchase some scoundrel of high social\r\nposition, foreign or native, for his daughter. Such a man is only\r\nthe more dangerous if he occasionally does some deed like founding a\r\ncollege or endowing a church, which makes those good people who are\r\nalso foolish forget his real iniquity. These men are equally careless\r\nof the workingmen, whom they oppress, and of the state, whose existence\r\nthey imperil. There are not very many of them, but there is a very\r\ngreat number of men who approach more or less closely to the type,\r\nand, just in so far as they do so approach, they are curses to the\r\ncountry. The man who is content to let politics go from bad to worse,\r\njesting at the corruption of politicians, the man who is content to\r\nsee the maladministration of justice without an immediate and resolute\r\neffort to reform it, is shirking his duty and is preparing the way for\r\ninfinite woe in the future. Hard, brutal indifference to the right,\r\nand an equally brutal shortsightedness as to the inevitable results of\r\ncorruption and injustice, are baleful beyond measure; and yet they are\r\ncharacteristic of a great many Americans who think themselves perfectly\r\nrespectable, and who are considered thriving, prosperous men by their\r\neasy-going fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nAnother class, merging into this, and only less dangerous, is that of\r\nthe men whose ideals are purely material. These are the men who are\r\nwilling to go for good government when they think it will pay, but\r\nwho measure everything by the shop-till, the people who are unable to\r\nappreciate any quality that is not a mercantile commodity, who do not\r\nunderstand that a poet may do far more for a country than the owner\r\nof a nail factory, who do not realize that no amount of commercial\r\nprosperity can supply the lack of the heroic virtues, or can in itself\r\nsolve the terrible social problems which all the civilized world is now\r\nfacing. The mere materialist is, above all things, short-sighted. In a\r\nrecent article Mr. Edward Atkinson casually mentioned that the regular\r\narmy could now render the country no “effective or useful service.”\r\nTwo months before this sapient remark was printed the regular army\r\nhad saved Chicago from the fate of Paris in 1870 and had prevented\r\na terrible social war in the West. At the end of this article Mr.\r\nAtkinson indulged in a curious rhapsody against the navy, denouncing\r\nits existence and being especially wrought up, not because war-vessels\r\ntake life, but because they “destroy commerce.” To men of a certain\r\nkind, trade and property are far more sacred than life or honor, of\r\nfar more consequence than the great thoughts and lofty emotions,\r\nwhich alone make a nation mighty. They believe, with a faith almost\r\ntouching in its utter feebleness, that “the Angel of Peace, draped\r\nin a garment of untaxed calico,” has given her final message to men\r\nwhen she has implored them to devote all their energies to producing\r\noleomargarine at a quarter of a cent less a firkin, or to importing\r\nwoollens for a fraction less than they can be made at home. These\r\nsolemn prattlers strive after an ideal in which they shall happily\r\nunite the imagination of a green-grocer with the heart of a Bengalee\r\nbaboo. They are utterly incapable of feeling one thrill of generous\r\nemotion, or the slightest throb of that pulse which gives to the world\r\nstatesmen, patriots, warriors, and poets, and which makes a nation\r\nother than a cumberer of the world’s surface. In the concluding page of\r\nhis article Mr. Atkinson, complacently advancing his panacea, his quack\r\ncure-all, says that “all evil powers of the world will go down before”\r\na policy of “reciprocity of trade without obstruction”! Fatuity can go\r\nno farther.\r\n\r\nNo Populist who wishes a currency based on corn and cotton stands in\r\nmore urgent need of applied common sense than does the man who believes\r\nthat the adoption of any policy; no matter what, in reference to our\r\nforeign commerce, will cut that tangled knot of social well-being\r\nand misery at which the fingers of the London free-trader clutch as\r\nhelplessly as those of the Berlin protectionist. Such a man represents\r\nindividually an almost imponderable element in the work and thought\r\nof the community; but in the aggregate he stands for a real danger,\r\nbecause he stands for a feeling evident of late years among many\r\nrespectable people. The people who pride themselves upon having a\r\npurely commercial ideal are apparently unaware that such an ideal\r\nis as essentially mean and sordid as any in the world, and that no\r\nbandit community of the Middle Ages can have led a more unlovely life\r\nthan would be the life of men to whom trade and manufactures were\r\neverything, and to whom such words as national honor and glory,\r\nas courage and daring, and loyalty and unselfishness, had become\r\nmeaningless. The merely material, the merely commercial ideal, the\r\nideal of the men “whose fatherland is the till,” is in its very essence\r\ndebasing and lowering. It is as true now as ever it was that no man\r\nand no nation shall live by bread alone. Thrift and industry are\r\nindispensable virtues; but they are not all-sufficient. We must base\r\nour appeals for civic and national betterment on nobler grounds than\r\nthose of mere business expediency.\r\n\r\nWe have examples enough and to spare that tend to evil; nevertheless,\r\nfor our good fortune, the men who have most impressed themselves upon\r\nthe thought of the nation have left behind them careers the influence\r\nof which must tell for good. The unscrupulous speculator who rises to\r\nenormous wealth by swindling his neighbor; the capitalist who oppresses\r\nthe workingman; the agitator who wrongs the workingman yet more deeply\r\nby trying to teach him to rely not upon himself, but partly upon the\r\ncharity of individuals or of the state and partly upon mob violence;\r\nthe man in public life who is a demagogue or corrupt, and the newspaper\r\nwriter who fails to attack him because of his corruption, or who\r\nslanderously assails him when he is honest; the political leader who,\r\ncursed by some obliquity of moral or of mental vision, seeks to produce\r\nsectional or social strife--all these, though important in their day,\r\nhave hitherto failed to leave any lasting impress upon the life of\r\nthe nation. The men who have profoundly influenced the growth of our\r\nnational character have been in most cases precisely those men whose\r\ninfluence was for the best and was strongly felt as antagonistic to the\r\nworst tendency of the age. The great writers, who have written in prose\r\nor verse, have done much for us. The great orators whose burning words\r\non behalf of liberty, of union, of honest government, have rung through\r\nour legislative halls, have done even more. Most of all has been done\r\nby the men who have spoken to us through deeds and not words, or whose\r\nwords have gathered their especial charm and significance because they\r\ncame from men who did speak in deeds. A nation’s greatness lies in its\r\npossibility of achievement in the present, and nothing helps it more\r\nthan the consciousness of achievement in the past.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] _The Forum_, February, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                          TRUE AMERICANISM[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nPatriotism was once defined as “the last refuge of a scoundrel”;\r\nand somebody has recently remarked that when Dr. Johnson gave this\r\ndefinition he was ignorant of the infinite possibilities contained\r\nin the word “reform.” Of course both gibes were quite justifiable,\r\nin so far as they were aimed at people who use noble names to cloak\r\nbase purposes. Equally of course the man shows little wisdom and a\r\nlow sense of duty who fails to see that love of country is one of the\r\nelemental virtues, even though scoundrels play upon it for their own\r\nselfish ends; and, inasmuch as abuses continually grow up in civic life\r\nas in all other kinds of life, the statesman is indeed a weakling who\r\nhesitates to reform these abuses because the word “reform” is often on\r\nthe lips of men who are silly or dishonest.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of patriotism and reform is true also of Americanism.\r\nThere are plenty of scoundrels always ready to try to belittle\r\nreform movements or to bolster up existing iniquities in the name of\r\nAmericanism; but this does not alter the fact that the man who can do\r\nmost in this country is and must be the man whose Americanism is most\r\nsincere and intense. Outrageous though it is to use a noble idea as\r\nthe cloak for evil, it is still worse to assail the noble idea itself\r\nbecause it can thus be used. The men who do iniquity in the name of\r\npatriotism, of reform, of Americanism, are merely one small division of\r\nthe class that has always existed and will always exist,--the class of\r\nhypocrites and demagogues, the class that is always prompt to steal the\r\nwatchwords of righteousness and use them in the interests of evil-doing.\r\n\r\nThe stoutest and truest Americans are the very men who have the least\r\nsympathy with the people who invoke the spirit of Americanism to aid\r\nwhat is vicious in our government or to throw obstacles in the way of\r\nthose who strive to reform it. It is contemptible to oppose a movement\r\nfor good because that movement has already succeeded somewhere else,\r\nor to champion an existing abuse because our people have always been\r\nwedded to it. To appeal to national prejudice against a given reform\r\nmovement is in every way unworthy and silly. It is as childish to\r\ndenounce free trade because England has adopted it as to advocate\r\nit for the same reason. It is eminently proper, in dealing with the\r\ntariff, to consider the effect of tariff legislation in time past upon\r\nother nations as well as the effect upon our own; but in drawing\r\nconclusions it is in the last degree foolish to try to excite prejudice\r\nagainst one system because it is in vogue in some given country, or to\r\ntry to excite prejudice in its favor because the economists of that\r\ncountry have found that it was suited to their own peculiar needs. In\r\nattempting to solve our difficult problem of municipal government it is\r\nmere folly to refuse to profit by whatever is good in the examples of\r\nManchester and Berlin because these cities are foreign, exactly as it\r\nis mere folly blindly to copy their examples without reference to our\r\nown totally different conditions. As for the absurdity of declaiming\r\nagainst civil-service reform, for instance, as “Chinese,” because\r\nwritten examinations have been used in China, it would be quite as\r\nwise to declaim against gunpowder because it was first utilized by the\r\nsame people. In short, the man who, whether from mere dull fatuity or\r\nfrom an active interest in misgovernment, tries to appeal to American\r\nprejudice against things foreign, so as to induce Americans to oppose\r\nany measure for good, should be looked on by his fellow-countrymen with\r\nthe heartiest contempt. So much for the men who appeal to the spirit\r\nof Americanism to sustain us in wrong-doing. But we must never let our\r\ncontempt for these men blind us to the nobility of the idea which they\r\nstrive to degrade.\r\n\r\nWe Americans have many grave problems to solve, many threatening evils\r\nto fight, and many deeds to do, if, as we hope and believe, we have\r\nthe wisdom, the strength, the courage, and the virtue to do them. But\r\nwe must face facts as they are. We must neither surrender ourselves\r\nto a foolish optimism, nor succumb to a timid and ignoble pessimism.\r\nOur nation is that one among all the nations of the earth which holds\r\nin its hands the fate of the coming years. We enjoy exceptional\r\nadvantages, and are menaced by exceptional dangers; and all signs\r\nindicate that we shall either fail greatly or succeed greatly. I\r\nfirmly believe that we shall succeed; but we must not foolishly blink\r\nthe dangers by which we are threatened, for that is the way to fail.\r\nOn the contrary, we must soberly set to work to find out all we can\r\nabout the existence and extent of every evil, must acknowledge it to\r\nbe such, and must then attack it with unyielding resolution. There are\r\nmany such evils, and each must be fought after a separate fashion;\r\nyet there is one quality which we must bring to the solution of every\r\nproblem,--that is, an intense and fervid Americanism. We shall never be\r\nsuccessful over the dangers that confront us; we shall never achieve\r\ntrue greatness, nor reach the lofty ideal which the founders and\r\npreservers of our mighty Federal Republic have set before us, unless we\r\nare Americans in heart and soul, in spirit and purpose, keenly alive\r\nto the responsibility implied in the very name of American, and proud\r\nbeyond measure of the glorious privilege of bearing it.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three sides to the question of Americanism, and two\r\nor three senses in which the word “Americanism” can be used to express\r\nthe antithesis of what is unwholesome and undesirable. In the first\r\nplace we wish to be broadly American and national, as opposed to being\r\nlocal or sectional. We do not wish, in politics, in literature, or in\r\nart, to develop that unwholesome parochial spirit, that over-exaltation\r\nof the little community at the expense of the great nation, which\r\nproduces what has been described as the patriotism of the village,\r\nthe patriotism of the belfry. Politically, the indulgence of this\r\nspirit was the chief cause of the calamities which befell the ancient\r\nrepublics of Greece, the mediæval republics of Italy, and the petty\r\nStates of Germany as it was in the last century. It is this spirit of\r\nprovincial patriotism, this inability to take a view of broad adhesion\r\nto the whole nation that has been the chief among the causes that have\r\nproduced such anarchy in the South American States, and which have\r\nresulted in presenting to us, not one great Spanish-American federal\r\nnation stretching from the Rio Grande to Cape Horn, but a squabbling\r\nmultitude of revolution-ridden States, not one of which stands even\r\nin the second rank as a power. However, politically this question of\r\nAmerican nationality has been settled once for all. We are no longer\r\nin danger of repeating in our history the shameful and contemptible\r\ndisasters that have befallen the Spanish possessions on this continent\r\nsince they threw off the yoke of Spain. Indeed there is, all through\r\nour life, very much less of this parochial spirit than there was\r\nformerly. Still there is an occasional outcropping here and there; and\r\nit is just as well that we should keep steadily in mind the futility\r\nof talking of a Northern literature or a Southern literature, an\r\nEastern or a Western school of art or science. Joel Chandler Harris is\r\nemphatically a national writer; so is Mark Twain. They do not write\r\nmerely for Georgia or Missouri or California any more than for Illinois\r\nor Connecticut; they write as Americans and for all people who can\r\nread English. St. Gaudens lives in New York; but his work is just as\r\ndistinctive of Boston or Chicago. It is of very great consequence that\r\nwe should have a full and ripe literary development in the United\r\nStates, but it is not of the least consequence whether New York, or\r\nBoston, or Chicago, or San Francisco becomes the literary or artistic\r\ncentre of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is a second side to this question of a broad Americanism,\r\nhowever. The patriotism of the village or the belfrey is bad, but the\r\nlack of all patriotism is even worse. There are philosophers who assure\r\nus, that in the future, patriotism will be regarded not as a virtue\r\nat all, but merely as a mental stage in the journey toward a state of\r\nfeeling when our patriotism will include the whole human race and all\r\nthe world. This may be so; but the age of which these philosophers\r\nspeak is still several æons distant. In fact, philosophers of this\r\ntype are so very advanced that they are of no practical service to\r\nthe present generation. It may be, that in ages so remote that we\r\ncannot now understand any of the feelings of those who will dwell in\r\nthem, patriotism will no longer be regarded as a virtue, exactly as\r\nit may be that in those remote ages people will look down upon and\r\ndisregard monogamic marriage; but as things now are and have been for\r\ntwo or three thousand years past, and are likely to be for two or\r\nthree thousand years to come, the words “home” and “country” mean a\r\ngreat deal. Nor do they show any tendency to lose their significance.\r\nAt present, treason, like adultery, ranks as one of the worst of all\r\npossible crimes.\r\n\r\nOne may fall very far short of treason and yet be an undesirable\r\ncitizen in the community. The man who becomes Europeanized, who loses\r\nhis power of doing good work on this side of the water, and who loses\r\nhis love for his native land, is not a traitor; but he is a silly and\r\nundesirable citizen. He is as emphatically a noxious element in our\r\nbody politic as is the man who comes here from abroad and remains a\r\nforeigner. Nothing will more quickly or more surely disqualify a man\r\nfrom doing good work in the world than the acquirement of that flaccid\r\nhabit of mind which its possessors style cosmopolitanism.\r\n\r\nIt is not only necessary to Americanize the immigrants of foreign birth\r\nwho settle among us, but it is even more necessary for those among us\r\nwho are by birth and descent already Americans not to throw away our\r\nbirthright, and, with incredible and contemptible folly, wander back to\r\nbow down before the alien gods whom our forefathers forsook. It is hard\r\nto believe that there is any necessity to warn Americans that, when\r\nthey seek to model themselves on the lines of other civilizations,\r\nthey make themselves the butts of all right-thinking men; and yet\r\nthe necessity certainly exists to give this warning to many of our\r\ncitizens who pride themselves on their standing in the world of art\r\nand letters, or, perchance, on what they would style their social\r\nleadership in the community. It is always better to be an original\r\nthan an imitation, even when the imitation is of something better than\r\nthe original; but what shall we say of the fool who is content to be\r\nan imitation of something worse? Even if the weaklings who seek to be\r\nother than Americans were right in deeming other nations to be better\r\nthan their own, the fact yet remains that to be a first-class American\r\nis fifty-fold better than to be a second-class imitation of a Frenchman\r\nor Englishman. As a matter of fact, however, those of our countrymen\r\nwho do believe in American inferiority are always individuals who,\r\nhowever cultivated, have some organic weakness in their moral or mental\r\nmake-up; and the great mass of our people, who are robustly patriotic,\r\nand who have sound, healthy minds, are justified in regarding these\r\nfeeble renegades with a half-impatient and half-amused scorn.\r\n\r\nWe believe in waging relentless war on rank-growing evils of all\r\nkinds, and it makes no difference to us if they happen to be of purely\r\nnative growth. We grasp at any good, no matter whence it comes. We do\r\nnot accept the evil attendant upon another system of government as\r\nan adequate excuse for that attendant upon our own; the fact that\r\nthe courtier is a scamp does not render the demagogue any the less\r\na scoundrel. But it remains true that, in spite of all our faults\r\nand shortcomings, no other land offers such glorious possibilities\r\nto the man able to take advantage of them, as does ours; it remains\r\ntrue that no one of our people can do any work really worth doing\r\nunless he does it primarily as an American. It is because certain\r\nclasses of our people still retain their spirit of colonial dependence\r\non, and exaggerated deference to, European opinion, that they fail\r\nto accomplish what they ought to. It is precisely along the lines\r\nwhere we have worked most independently that we have accomplished\r\nthe greatest results; and it is in those professions where there\r\nhas been no servility to, but merely a wise profiting by, foreign\r\nexperience, that we have produced our greatest men. Our soldiers and\r\nstatesmen and orators; our explorers, our wilderness-winners, and\r\ncommonwealth-builders; the men who have made our laws and seen that\r\nthey were executed; and the other men whose energy and ingenuity have\r\ncreated our marvellous material prosperity,--all these have been men\r\nwho have drawn wisdom from the experience of every age and nation, but\r\nwho have nevertheless thought, and worked, and conquered, and lived,\r\nand died, purely as Americans; and on the whole they have done better\r\nwork than has been done in any other country during the short period of\r\nour national life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is in those professions where our people have\r\nstriven hardest to mould themselves in conventional European forms\r\nthat they have succeeded least; and this holds true to the present day,\r\nthe failure being of course most conspicuous where the man takes up\r\nhis abode in Europe; where he becomes a second-rate European, because\r\nhe is over-civilized, over-sensitive, over-refined, and has lost the\r\nhardihood and manly courage by which alone he can conquer in the keen\r\nstruggle of our national life. Be it remembered, too, that this same\r\nbeing does not really become a European; he only ceases being an\r\nAmerican, and becomes nothing. He throws away a great prize for the\r\nsake of a lesser one, and does not even get the lesser one. The painter\r\nwho goes to Paris, not merely to get two or three years’ thorough\r\ntraining in his art, but with the deliberate purpose of taking up his\r\nabode there, and with the intention of following in the ruts worn deep\r\nby ten thousand earlier travellers, instead of striking off to rise\r\nor fall on a new line, thereby forfeits all chance of doing the best\r\nwork. He must content himself with aiming at that kind of mediocrity\r\nwhich consists in doing fairly well what has already been done better;\r\nand he usually never even sees the grandeur and picturesqueness lying\r\nopen before the eyes of every man who can read the book of America’s\r\npast and the book of America’s present. Thus it is with the undersized\r\nman of letters, who flees his country because he, with his delicate,\r\neffeminate sensitiveness, finds the conditions of life on this side\r\nof the water crude and raw; in other words, because he finds that he\r\ncannot play a man’s part among men, and so goes where he will be\r\nsheltered from the winds that harden stouter souls. This _emigré_ may\r\nwrite graceful and pretty verses, essays, novels; but he will never\r\ndo work to compare with that of his brother, who is strong enough to\r\nstand on his own feet, and do his work as an American. Thus it is\r\nwith the scientist who spends his youth in a German university, and\r\ncan thenceforth work only in the fields already fifty times furrowed\r\nby the German ploughs. Thus it is with that most foolish of parents\r\nwho sends his children to be educated abroad, not knowing--what every\r\nclear-sighted man from Washington and Jay down has known--that the\r\nAmerican who is to make his way in America should be brought up among\r\nhis fellow Americans. It is among the people who like to consider\r\nthemselves, and, indeed, to a large extent are, the leaders of the\r\nso-called social world, especially in some of the northeastern cities,\r\nthat this colonial habit of thought, this thoroughly provincial spirit\r\nof admiration for things foreign, and inability to stand on one’s own\r\nfeet, becomes most evident and most despicable. We believe in every\r\nkind of honest and lawful pleasure, so long as the getting it is not\r\nmade man’s chief business; and we believe heartily in the good that\r\ncan be done by men of leisure who work hard in their leisure, whether\r\nat politics or philanthropy, literature or art. But a leisure class\r\nwhose leisure simply means idleness is a curse to the community, and\r\nin so far as its members distinguish themselves chiefly by aping the\r\nworst--not the best--traits of similar people across the water, they\r\nbecome both comic and noxious elements of the body politic.\r\n\r\nThe third sense in which the word “Americanism” may be employed is\r\nwith reference to the Americanizing of the newcomers to our shores.\r\nWe must Americanize them in every way, in speech, in political ideas\r\nand principles, and in their way of looking at the relations between\r\nChurch and State. We welcome the German or the Irishman who becomes\r\nan American. We have no use for the German or Irishman who remains\r\nsuch. We do not wish German-Americans and Irish-Americans who figure\r\nas such in our social and political life; we want only Americans, and,\r\nprovided they are such, we do not care whether they are of native or of\r\nIrish or of German ancestry. We have no room in any healthy American\r\ncommunity for a German-American vote or an Irish-American vote, and it\r\nis contemptible demagogy to put planks into any party platform with the\r\npurpose of catching such a vote. We have no room for any people who do\r\nnot act and vote simply as Americans, and as nothing else. Moreover, we\r\nhave as little use for people who carry religious prejudices into our\r\npolitics as for those who carry prejudices of caste or nationality. We\r\nstand unalterably in favor of the public-school system in its entirety.\r\nWe believe that English, and no other language, is that in which all\r\nthe school exercises should be conducted. We are against any division\r\nof the school fund, and against any appropriation of public money for\r\nsectarian purposes. We are against any recognition whatever by the\r\nState in any shape or form of State-aided parochial schools. But we\r\nare equally opposed to any discrimination against or for a man because\r\nof his creed. We demand that all citizens, Protestant and Catholic,\r\nJew and Gentile, shall have fair treatment in every way; that all\r\nalike shall have their rights guaranteed them. The very reasons that\r\nmake us unqualified in our opposition to State-aided sectarian schools\r\nmake us equally bent that, in the management of our public schools,\r\nthe adherents of each creed shall be given exact and equal justice,\r\nwholly without regard to their religious affiliations; that trustees,\r\nsuperintendents, teachers, scholars, all alike, shall be treated\r\nwithout any reference whatsoever to the creed they profess. We maintain\r\nthat it is an outrage, in voting for a man for any position, whether\r\nState or national, to take into account his religious faith, provided\r\nonly he is a good American. When a secret society does what in some\r\nplaces the American Protective Association seems to have done, and\r\ntries to proscribe Catholics both politically and socially, the members\r\nof such society show that they themselves are as utterly un-American,\r\nas alien to our school of political thought, as the worst immigrants\r\nwho land on our shores. Their conduct is equally base and contemptible;\r\nthey are the worst foes of our public-school system, because they\r\nstrengthen the hands of its ultramontane enemies; they should receive\r\nthe hearty condemnation of all Americans who are truly patriotic.\r\n\r\nThe mighty tide of immigration to our shores has brought in its train\r\nmuch of good and much of evil; and whether the good or the evil shall\r\npredominate depends mainly on whether these newcomers do or do not\r\nthrow themselves heartily into our national life, cease to be European,\r\nand become Americans like the rest of us. More than a third of the\r\npeople of the Northern States are of foreign birth or parentage. An\r\nimmense number of them have become completely Americanized, and these\r\nstand on exactly the same plane as the descendants of any Puritan,\r\nCavalier, or Knickerbocker among us, and do their full and honorable\r\nshare of the nation’s work. But where immigrants, or the sons of\r\nimmigrants, do not heartily and in good faith throw in their lot\r\nwith us, but cling to the speech, the customs, the ways of life, and\r\nthe habits of thought of the Old World which they have left, they\r\nthereby harm both themselves and us. If they remain alien elements,\r\nunassimilated, and with interests separate from ours, they are mere\r\nobstructions to the current of our national life, and, moreover, can\r\nget no good from it themselves. In fact, though we ourselves also\r\nsuffer from their perversity, it is they who really suffer most. It\r\nis an immense benefit to the European immigrant to change him into an\r\nAmerican citizen. To bear the name of American is to bear the most\r\nhonorable of titles; and whoever does not so believe has no business\r\nto bear the name at all, and, if he comes from Europe, the sooner\r\nhe goes back there the better. Besides, the man who does not become\r\nAmericanized nevertheless fails to remain a European, and becomes\r\nnothing at all. The immigrant cannot possibly remain what he was,\r\nor continue to be a member of the Old-World society. If he tries to\r\nretain his old language, in a few generations it becomes a barbarous\r\njargon; if he tries to retain his old customs and ways of life, in a\r\nfew generations he becomes an uncouth boor. He has cut himself off from\r\nthe Old-World, and cannot retain his connection with it; and if he\r\nwishes ever to amount to anything he must throw himself heart and soul,\r\nand without reservation, into the new life to which he has come. It is\r\nurgently necessary to check and regulate our immigration, by much more\r\ndrastic laws than now exist; and this should be done both to keep out\r\nlaborers who tend to depress the labor market, and to keep out races\r\nwhich do not assimilate readily with our own, and unworthy individuals\r\nof all races--not only criminals, idiots, and paupers, but anarchists\r\nof the Most and O’Donovan Rossa type.\r\n\r\nFrom his own standpoint, it is beyond all question the wise thing for\r\nthe immigrant to become thoroughly Americanized. Moreover, from our\r\nstandpoint, we have a right to demand it. We freely extend the hand\r\nof welcome and of good-fellowship to every man, no matter what his\r\ncreed or birthplace, who comes here honestly intent on becoming a good\r\nUnited States citizen like the rest of us; but we have a right, and\r\nit is our duty, to demand that he shall indeed become so, and shall\r\nnot confuse the issues with which we are struggling by introducing\r\namong us Old-World quarrels and prejudices. There are certain ideas\r\nwhich he must give up. For instance, he must learn that American life\r\nis incompatible with the existence of any form of anarchy, or of any\r\nsecret society having murder for its aim, whether at home or abroad;\r\nand he must learn that we exact full religious toleration and the\r\ncomplete separation of Church and State. Moreover, he must not bring\r\nin his Old-World religious race and national antipathies, but must\r\nmerge them into love for our common country, and must take pride in the\r\nthings which we can all take pride in. He must revere only our flag;\r\nnot only must it come first, but no other flag should even come second.\r\nHe must learn to celebrate Washington’s birthday rather than that of\r\nthe Queen or Kaiser, and the Fourth of July instead of St. Patrick’s\r\nDay. Our political and social questions must be settled on their own\r\nmerits, and not complicated by quarrels between England and Ireland, or\r\nFrance and Germany, with which we have nothing to do: it is an outrage\r\nto fight an American political campaign with reference to questions\r\nof European politics. Above all, the immigrant must learn to talk and\r\nthink and _be_ United States.\r\n\r\nThe immigrant of to-day can learn much from the experience of the\r\nimmigrants of the past, who came to America prior to the Revolutionary\r\nWar. We were then already, what we are now, a people of mixed blood.\r\nMany of our most illustrious Revolutionary names were borne by men\r\nof Huguenot blood--Jay, Sevier, Marion, Laurens. But the Huguenots\r\nwere, on the whole, the best immigrants we have ever received; sooner\r\nthan any other, and more completely, they became American in speech,\r\nconviction, and thought. The Hollanders took longer than the Huguenots\r\nto become completely assimilated; nevertheless they in the end became\r\nso, immensely to their own advantage. One of the leading Revolutionary\r\ngenerals, Schuyler, and one of the Presidents of the United States,\r\nVan Buren, were of Dutch blood; but they rose to their positions,\r\nthe highest in the land, because they had become Americans and had\r\nceased being Hollanders. If they had remained members of an alien\r\nbody, cut off by their speech and customs and belief from the rest\r\nof the American community, Schuyler would have lived his life as a\r\nboorish, provincial squire, and Van Buren would have ended his days\r\na small tavern-keeper. So it is with the Germans of Pennsylvania.\r\nThose of them who became Americanized have furnished to our history\r\na multitude of honorable names, from the days of the Mühlenbergs\r\nonward; but those who did not become Americanized form to the present\r\nday an unimportant body, of no significance in American existence.\r\nSo it is with the Irish, who gave to Revolutionary annals such names\r\nas Carroll and Sullivan, and to the Civil War men like Sheridan--men\r\nwho were Americans and nothing else: while the Irish who remain such,\r\nand busy themselves solely with alien politics, can have only an\r\nunhealthy influence upon American life, and can never rise as do their\r\ncompatriots who become straightout Americans. Thus it has ever been\r\nwith all people who have come hither, of whatever stock or blood. The\r\nsame thing is true of the churches. A church which remains foreign, in\r\nlanguage or spirit, is doomed.\r\n\r\nBut I wish to be distinctly understood on one point. Americanism\r\nis a question of spirit, conviction, and purpose, not of creed or\r\nbirthplace. The politician who bids for the Irish or German vote,\r\nor the Irishman or German who votes as an Irishman or German, is\r\ndespicable, for all citizens of this commonwealth should vote solely\r\nas Americans; but he is not a whit less despicable than the voter who\r\nvotes against a good American, merely because that American happens to\r\nhave been born in Ireland or Germany. Know-nothingism, in any form, is\r\nas utterly un-American as foreignism. It is a base outrage to oppose\r\na man because of his religion or birthplace, and all good citizens\r\nwill hold any such effort in abhorrence. A Scandinavian, a German, or\r\nan Irishman who has really become an American has the right to stand\r\non exactly the same footing as any native-born citizen in the land,\r\nand is just as much entitled to the friendship and support, social\r\nand political, of his neighbors. Among the men with whom I have been\r\nthrown in close personal contact socially, and who have been among my\r\nstaunchest friends and allies politically, are not a few Americans who\r\nhappen to have been born on the other side of the water, in Germany,\r\nIreland, Scandinavia; and there could be no better men in the ranks of\r\nour native-born citizens.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I cannot better express the ideal attitude that should be\r\ntaken by our fellow-citizens of foreign birth than by quoting the words\r\nof a representative American, born in Germany, the Honorable Richard\r\nGuenther, of Wisconsin. In a speech spoken at the time of the Samoan\r\ntrouble, he said:\r\n\r\n “We know as well as any other class of American citizens where our\r\n duties belong. We will work for our country in time of peace and\r\n fight for it in time of war, if a time of war should ever come. When\r\n I say our country, I mean, of course, our adopted country. I mean\r\n the United States of America. After passing through the crucible\r\n of naturalization, we are no longer Germans; we are Americans.\r\n Our attachment to America cannot be measured by the length of our\r\n residence here. We are Americans from the moment we touch the American\r\n shore until we are laid in American graves. We will fight for America\r\n whenever necessary. America, first, last, and all the time. America\r\n against Germany, America against the world; America, right or wrong;\r\n always America. We are Americans.”\r\n\r\nAll honor to the man who spoke such words as those; and I believe\r\nthey express the feelings of the great majority of those among our\r\nfellow-American citizens who were born abroad. We Americans can only\r\ndo our allotted task well if we face it steadily and bravely, seeing\r\nbut not fearing the dangers. Above all we must stand shoulder to\r\nshoulder, not asking as to the ancestry or creed of our comrades, but\r\nonly demanding that they be in very truth Americans, and that we all\r\nwork together, heart, hand, and head, for the honor and the greatness\r\nof our common country.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] _The Forum_, April, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n              THE MANLY VIRTUES AND PRACTICAL POLITICS[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes, in addressing men who sincerely desire the betterment of our\r\npublic affairs, but who have not taken active part in directing them,\r\nI feel tempted to tell them that there are two gospels which should be\r\npreached to every reformer. The first is the gospel of morality; the\r\nsecond is the gospel of efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo decent, upright citizens it is hardly necessary to preach the\r\ndoctrine of morality as applied to the affairs of public life. It is\r\nan even graver offence to sin against the commonwealth than to sin\r\nagainst an individual. The man who debauches our public life, whether\r\nby malversation of funds in office, by the actual bribery of voters\r\nor of legislators, or by the corrupt use of the offices as spoils\r\nwherewith to reward the unworthy and the vicious for their noxious\r\nand interested activity in the baser walks of political life,--this\r\nman is a greater foe to our well-being as a nation than is even the\r\ndefaulting cashier of a bank, or the betrayer of a private trust. No\r\namount of intelligence and no amount of energy will save a nation which\r\nis not honest, and no government can ever be a permanent success if\r\nadministered in accordance with base ideals. The first requisite in\r\nthe citizen who wishes to share the work of our public life, whether\r\nhe wishes himself to hold office or merely to do his plain duty as an\r\nAmerican by taking part in the management of our political machinery,\r\nis that he shall act disinterestedly and with a sincere purpose to\r\nserve the whole commonwealth.\r\n\r\nBut disinterestedness and honesty and unselfish desire to do what\r\nis right are not enough in themselves. A man must not only be\r\ndisinterested, but he must be efficient. If he goes into politics he\r\nmust go into practical politics, in order to make his influence felt.\r\nPractical politics must not be construed to mean dirty politics. On\r\nthe contrary, in the long run the politics of fraud and treachery\r\nand foulness are unpractical politics, and the most practical of all\r\npoliticians is the politician who is clean and decent and upright. But\r\na man who goes into the actual battles of the political world must\r\nprepare himself much as he would for the struggle in any other branch\r\nof our life. He must be prepared to meet men of far lower ideals than\r\nhis own, and to face things, not as he would wish them, but as they\r\nare. He must not lose his own high ideal, and yet he must face the fact\r\nthat the majority of the men with whom he must work have lower ideals.\r\nHe must stand firmly for what he believes, and yet he must realize that\r\npolitical action, to be effective, must be the joint action of many\r\nmen, and that he must sacrifice somewhat of his own opinions to those\r\nof his associates if he ever hopes to see his desires take practical\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nThe prime thing that every man who takes an interest in politics\r\nshould remember is that he must act, and not merely criticise the\r\nactions of others. It is not the man who sits by his fireside reading\r\nhis evening paper, and saying how bad our politics and politicians\r\nare, who will ever do anything to save us; it is the man who goes\r\nout into the rough hurly-burly of the caucus, the primary, and the\r\npolitical meeting, and there faces his fellows on equal terms. The\r\nreal service is rendered, not by the critic who stands aloof from the\r\ncontest, but by the man who enters into it and bears his part as a man\r\nshould, undeterred by the blood and the sweat. It is a pleasant but a\r\ndangerous thing to associate merely with cultivated, refined men of\r\nhigh ideals and sincere purpose to do right, and to think that one has\r\ndone all one’s duty by discussing politics with such associates. It\r\nis a good thing to meet men of this stamp; indeed it is a necessary\r\nthing, for we thereby brighten our ideals, and keep in touch with the\r\npeople who are unselfish in their purposes; but if we associate with\r\nsuch men exclusively we can accomplish nothing. The actual battle must\r\nbe fought out on other and less pleasant fields. The actual advance\r\nmust be made in the field of practical politics among the men who\r\nrepresent or guide or control the mass of the voters, the men who are\r\nsometimes rough and coarse, who sometimes have lower ideals than they\r\nshould, but who are capable, masterful, and efficient. It is only by\r\nmingling on equal terms with such men, by showing them that one is\r\nable to give and to receive heavy punishment without flinching, and\r\nthat one can master the details of political management as well as\r\nthey can, that it is possible for a man to establish a standing that\r\nwill be useful to him in fighting for a great reform. Every man who\r\nwishes well to his country is in honor bound to take an active part\r\nin political life. If he does his duty and takes that active part\r\nhe will be sure occasionally to commit mistakes and to be guilty of\r\nshortcomings. For these mistakes and shortcomings he will receive the\r\nunmeasured denunciation of the critics who commit neither because\r\nthey never do anything but criticise. Nevertheless he will have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that the salvation of the country ultimately\r\nlies, not in the hands of his critics, but in the hands of those who,\r\nhowever imperfectly, actually do the work of the nation. I would not\r\nfor one moment be understood as objecting to criticism or failing to\r\nappreciate its importance. We need fearless criticism of our public men\r\nand public parties; we need unsparing condemnation of all persons and\r\nall principles that count for evil in our public life: but it behooves\r\nevery man to remember that the work of the critic, important though\r\nit is, is of altogether secondary importance, and that, in the end,\r\nprogress is accomplished by the man who does the things, and not by the\r\nman who talks about how they ought or ought not to be done.\r\n\r\nTherefore the man who wishes to do good in his community must go into\r\nactive political life. If he is a Republican, let him join his local\r\nRepublican association; if a Democrat, the Democratic association; if\r\nan Independent, then let him put himself in touch with those who think\r\nas he does. In any event let him make himself an active force and make\r\nhis influence felt. Whether he works within or without party lines he\r\ncan surely find plenty of men who are desirous of good government,\r\nand who, if they act together, become at once a power on the side\r\nof righteousness. Of course, in a government like ours, a man can\r\naccomplish anything only by acting in combination with others, and\r\nequally, of course, a number of people can act together only by each\r\nsacrificing certain of his beliefs or prejudices. That man is indeed\r\nunfortunate who cannot in any given district find some people with\r\nwhom he can conscientiously act. He may find that he can do best by\r\nacting within a party organization; he may find that he can do best by\r\nacting, at least for certain purposes, or at certain times, outside of\r\nparty organizations, in an independent body of some kind; but with some\r\nassociation he must act if he wishes to exert any real influence.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be always remembered is that neither independence on the\r\none hand nor party fealty on the other can ever be accepted as an\r\nexcuse for failure to do active work in politics. The party man who\r\noffers his allegiance to party as an excuse for blindly following his\r\nparty, right or wrong, and who fails to try to make that party in any\r\nway better, commits a crime against the country; and a crime quite as\r\nserious is committed by the independent who makes his independence an\r\nexcuse for easy self-indulgence, and who thinks that when he says he\r\nbelongs to neither party he is excused from the duty of taking part in\r\nthe practical work of party organizations. The party man is bound to do\r\nhis full share in party management. He is bound to attend the caucuses\r\nand the primaries, to see that only good men are put up, and to exert\r\nhis influence as strenuously against the foes of good government within\r\nhis party, as, through his party machinery, he does against those who\r\nare without the party. In the same way the independent, if he cannot\r\ntake part in the regular organizations, is bound to do just as much\r\nactive constructive work (not merely the work of criticism) outside;\r\nhe is bound to try to get up an organization of his own and to try to\r\nmake that organization felt in some effective manner. Whatever course\r\nthe man who wishes to do his duty by his country takes in reference\r\nto parties or to independence of parties, he is bound to try to put\r\nhimself in touch with men who think as he does, and to help make their\r\njoint influence felt in behalf of the powers that go for decency and\r\ngood government. He must try to accomplish things; he must not vote in\r\nthe air unless it is really necessary. Occasionally a man must cast a\r\n“conscience vote,” when there is no possibility of carrying to victory\r\nhis principles or his nominees; at times, indeed, this may be his\r\nhighest duty; but ordinarily this is not the case. As a general rule a\r\nman ought to work and vote for something which there is at least a a\r\nfair chance of putting into effect.\r\n\r\nYet another thing to be remembered by the man who wishes to make his\r\ninfluence felt for good in our politics is that he must act purely as\r\nan American. If he is not deeply imbued with the American spirit he\r\ncannot succeed. Any organization which tries to work along the line of\r\ncaste or creed, which fails to treat all American citizens on their\r\nmerits as men, will fail, and will deserve to fail. Where our political\r\nlife is healthy, there is and can be no room for any movement organized\r\nto help or to antagonize men because they do or do not profess a\r\ncertain religion, or because they were or were not born here or abroad.\r\nWe have a right to ask that those with whom we associate, and those for\r\nwhom we vote, shall be themselves good Americans in heart and spirit,\r\nunhampered by adherence to foreign ideals, and acting without regard\r\nto the national and religious prejudices of European countries; but if\r\nthey really are good Americans in spirit and thought and purpose, that\r\nis all that we have any right to consider in regard to them. In the\r\nsame way there must be no discrimination for or against any man because\r\nof his social standing. On the one side, there is nothing to be made\r\nout of a political organization which draws an exclusive social line,\r\nand on the other it must be remembered that it is just as un-American\r\nto vote against a man because he is rich as to vote against him because\r\nhe is poor. The one man has just as much right as the other to claim\r\nto be treated purely on his merits as a man. In short, to do good work\r\nin politics, the men who organize must organize wholly without regard\r\nto whether their associates were born here or abroad, whether they are\r\nProtestants or Catholics, Jews or Gentiles, whether they are bankers\r\nor butchers, professors or day-laborers. All that can rightly be asked\r\nof one’s political associates is that they shall be honest men, good\r\nAmericans, and substantially in accord as regards their political ideas.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that must not be forgotten by the man desirous of doing\r\ngood political work is the need of the rougher, manlier virtues,\r\nand above all the virtue of personal courage, physical as well\r\nas moral. If we wish to do good work for our country we must be\r\nunselfish, disinterested, sincerely desirous of the well-being of the\r\ncommonwealth, and capable of devoted adherence to a lofty ideal; but\r\nin addition we must be vigorous in mind and body, able to hold our own\r\nin rough conflict with our fellows, able to suffer punishment without\r\nflinching, and, at need, to repay it in kind with full interest. A\r\npeaceful and commercial civilization is always in danger of suffering\r\nthe loss of the virile fighting qualities without which no nation,\r\nhowever cultured, however refined, however thrifty and prosperous, can\r\never amount to anything. Every citizen should be taught, both in public\r\nand in private life, that while he must avoid brawling and quarrelling,\r\nit is his duty to stand up for his rights. He must realize that the\r\nonly man who is more contemptible than the blusterer and bully is the\r\ncoward. No man is worth much to the commonwealth if he is not capable\r\nof feeling righteous wrath and just indignation, if he is not stirred\r\nto hot anger by misdoing, and is not impelled to see justice meted\r\nout to the wrong-doers. No man is worth much anywhere if he does not\r\npossess both moral and physical courage. A politician who really serves\r\nhis country well, and deserves his country’s gratitude, must usually\r\npossess some of the hardy virtues which we admire in the soldier who\r\nserves his country well in the field.\r\n\r\nAn ardent young reformer is very apt to try to begin by reforming too\r\nmuch. He needs always to keep in mind that he has got to serve as a\r\nsergeant before he assumes the duties of commander-in-chief. It is\r\nright for him from the beginning to take a great interest in National,\r\nState, and Municipal affairs, and to try to make himself felt in them\r\nif the occasion arises; but the best work must be done by the citizen\r\nworking in his own ward or district. Let him associate himself with\r\nthe men who think as he does, and who, like him, are sincerely devoted\r\nto the public good. Then let them try to make themselves felt in the\r\nchoice of alderman, of council-man, of assemblyman. The politicians\r\nwill be prompt to recognize their power, and the people will recognize\r\nit too, after a while. Let them organize and work, undaunted by any\r\ntemporary defeat. If they fail at first, and if they fail again, let\r\nthem merely make up their minds to redouble their efforts, and perhaps\r\nalter their methods; but let them keep on working.\r\n\r\nIt is sheer unmanliness and cowardice to shrink from the contest\r\nbecause at first there is failure, or because the work is difficult\r\nor repulsive. No man who is worth his salt has any right to abandon\r\nthe effort to better our politics merely because he does not find it\r\npleasant, merely because it entails associations which to him happen\r\nto be disagreeable. Let him keep right on, taking the buffets he gets\r\ngood-humoredly, and repaying them with heartiness when the chance\r\narises. Let him make up his mind that he will have to face the violent\r\nopposition of the spoils politician, and also, too often, the unfair\r\nand ungenerous criticism of those who ought to know better. Let him\r\nbe careful not to show himself so thin-skinned as to mind either; let\r\nhim fight his way forward, paying only so much regard to both as is\r\nnecessary to enable him to win in spite of them. He may not, and indeed\r\nprobably will not, accomplish nearly as much as he would like to, or as\r\nhe thinks he ought to: but he will certainly accomplish something; and\r\nif he can feel that he has helped to elevate the type of representative\r\nsent to the municipal, the State, or the national legislature from his\r\ndistrict, or to elevate the standard of duty among the public officials\r\nin his own ward, he has a right to be profoundly satisfied with what he\r\nhas accomplished.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is one other matter which the man who tries to wake his\r\nfellows to higher political action would do well to ponder. It is a\r\ngood thing to appeal to citizens to work for good government because\r\nit will better their estate materially, but it is a far better thing\r\nto appeal to them to work for good government because it is right in\r\nitself to do so. Doubtless, if we can have clean honest politics, we\r\nshall be better off in material matters. A thoroughly pure, upright,\r\nand capable administration of the affairs of New York city results\r\nin a very appreciable increase of comfort to each citizen. We should\r\nhave better systems of transportation; we should have cleaner streets,\r\nbetter sewers, and the like. But it is sometimes difficult to show\r\nthe individual citizen that he will be individually better off in his\r\nbusiness and in his home affairs for taking part in politics. I do not\r\nthink it is always worth while to show that this will always be the\r\ncase. The citizen should be appealed to primarily on the ground that\r\nit is his plain duty, if he wishes to deserve the name of freeman, to\r\ndo his full share in the hard and difficult work of self-government.\r\nHe must do his share unless he is willing to prove himself unfit for\r\nfree institutions, fit only to live under a government where he will be\r\nplundered and bullied because he deserves to be plundered and bullied\r\non account of his selfish timidity and short-sightedness. A clean\r\nand decent government is sure in the end to benefit our citizens in\r\nthe material circumstances of their lives; but each citizen should be\r\nappealed to, to take part in bettering our politics, not for the sake\r\nof any possible improvement it may bring to his affairs, but on the\r\nground that it is his plain duty to do so, and that this is a duty\r\nwhich it is cowardly and dishonorable in him to shirk.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, the men who wish to work for decent politics must work\r\npractically, and yet must not swerve from their devotion to a high\r\nideal. They must actually do things, and not merely confine themselves\r\nto criticising those who do them. They must work disinterestedly, and\r\nappeal to the disinterested element in others, although they must also\r\ndo work which will result in the material betterment of the community.\r\nThey must act as Americans through and through, in spirit and hope and\r\npurpose, and, while being disinterested, unselfish, and generous in\r\ntheir dealings with others, they must also show that they possess the\r\nessential manly virtues of energy, of resolution, and of indomitable\r\npersonal courage.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _The Forum_, July, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                THE COLLEGE GRADUATE AND PUBLIC LIFE[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are always, in our national life, certain tendencies that give\r\nus ground for alarm, and certain others that give us ground for hope.\r\nAmong the latter we must put the fact that there has undoubtedly been a\r\ngrowing feeling among educated men that they are in honor bound to do\r\ntheir full share of the work of American public life.\r\n\r\nWe have in this country an equality of rights. It is the plain duty of\r\nevery man to see that his rights are respected. That weak good-nature\r\nwhich acquiesces in wrong-doing, whether from laziness, timidity,\r\nor indifference, is a very unwholesome quality. It should be second\r\nnature with every man to insist that he be given full justice. But\r\nif there is an equality of rights, there is an inequality of duties.\r\nIt is proper to demand more from the man with exceptional advantages\r\nthan from the man without them. A heavy moral obligation rests upon\r\nthe man of means and upon the man of education to do their full duty\r\nby their country. On no class does this obligation rest more heavily\r\nthan upon the men with a collegiate education, the men who are\r\ngraduates of our universities. Their education gives them no right\r\nto feel the least superiority over any of their fellow-citizens; but\r\nit certainly ought to make them feel that they should stand foremost\r\nin the honorable effort to serve the whole public by doing their\r\nduty as Americans in the body politic. This obligation very possibly\r\nrests even more heavily upon the men of means; but of this it is not\r\nnecessary now to speak. The men of mere wealth never can have and never\r\nshould have the capacity for doing good work that is possessed by the\r\nmen of exceptional mental training; but that they may become both a\r\nlaughing-stock and a menace to the community is made unpleasantly\r\napparent by that portion of the New York business and social world\r\nwhich is most in evidence in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nTo the great body of men who have had exceptional advantages in the\r\nway of educational facilities we have a right, then, to look for good\r\nservice to the state. The service may be rendered in many different\r\nways. In a reasonable number of cases, the man may himself rise to high\r\npolitical position. That men actually do so rise is shown by the number\r\nof graduates of Harvard, Yale, and our other universities who are now\r\ntaking a prominent part in public life. These cases must necessarily,\r\nhowever, form but a small part of the whole. The enormous majority of\r\nour educated men have to make their own living, and are obliged to\r\ntake up careers in which they must work heart and soul to succeed.\r\nNevertheless, the man of business and the man of science, the doctor of\r\ndivinity and the doctor of law, the architect, the engineer, and the\r\nwriter, all alike owe a positive duty to the community, the neglect of\r\nwhich they cannot excuse on any plea of their private affairs. They\r\nare bound to follow understandingly the course of public events; they\r\nare bound to try to estimate and form judgment upon public men; and\r\nthey are bound to act intelligently and effectively in support of the\r\nprinciples which they deem to be right and for the best interests of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing for this class of educated men to realize is\r\nthat they do not really form a class at all. I have used the word in\r\ndefault of another, but I have merely used it roughly to group together\r\npeople who have had unusual opportunities of a certain kind. A large\r\nnumber of the people to whom these opportunities are offered fail to\r\ntake advantage of them, and a very much larger number of those to whom\r\nthey have not been offered succeed none the less in making them for\r\nthemselves. An educated man must not go into politics as such; he must\r\ngo in simply as an American; and when he is once in, he will speedily\r\nrealize that he must work very hard indeed, or he will be upset by\r\nsome other American, with no education at all, but with much natural\r\ncapacity. His education ought to make him feel particularly ashamed of\r\nhimself if he acts meanly or dishonorably, or in any way falls short\r\nof the ideal of good citizenship, and it ought to make him feel that\r\nhe must show that he has profited by it; but it should certainly give\r\nhim no feeling of superiority until by actual work he has shown that\r\nsuperiority. In other words, the educated man must realize that he is\r\nliving in a democracy and under democratic conditions, and that he is\r\nentitled to no more respect and consideration than he can win by actual\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nThis must be steadily kept in mind not only by educated men themselves,\r\nbut particularly by the men who give the tone to our great educational\r\ninstitutions. These educational institutions, if they are to do their\r\nbest work, must strain every effort to keep their life in touch with\r\nthe life of the nation at the present day. This is necessary for\r\nthe country, but it is very much more necessary for the educated\r\nmen themselves. It is a misfortune for any land if its people of\r\ncultivation take little part in shaping its destiny; but the misfortune\r\nis far greater for the people of cultivation. The country has a right\r\nto demand the honest and efficient service of every man in it, but\r\nespecially of every man who has had the advantage of rigid mental\r\nand moral training; the country is so much the poorer when any class\r\nof honest men fail to do their duty by it; but the loss to the class\r\nitself is immeasurable. If our educated men as a whole become incapable\r\nof playing their full part in our life, if they cease doing their\r\nshare of the rough, hard work which must be done, and grow to take\r\na position of mere dilettanteism in our public affairs, they will\r\nspeedily sink in relation to their fellows who really do the work of\r\ngoverning, until they stand toward them as a cultivated, ineffective\r\nman with a taste for bric-a-brac stands toward a great artist. When\r\nonce a body of citizens becomes thoroughly out of touch and out of\r\ntemper with the national life, its usefulness is gone, and its power of\r\nleaving its mark on the times is gone also.\r\n\r\nThe first great lesson which the college graduate should learn is the\r\nlesson of work rather than of criticism. Criticism is necessary and\r\nuseful; it is often indispensable; but it can never take the place of\r\naction, or be even a poor substitute for it. The function of the mere\r\ncritic is of very subordinate usefulness. It is the doer of deeds who\r\nactually counts in the battle for life, and not the man who looks on\r\nand says how the fight ought to be fought, without himself sharing the\r\nstress and the danger.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a need for proper critical work. Wrongs should be\r\nstrenuously and fearlessly denounced; evil principles and evil men\r\nshould be condemned. The politician who cheats or swindles, or the\r\nnewspaper man who lies in any form, should be made to feel that he is\r\nan object of scorn for all honest men. We need fearless criticism; but\r\nwe need that it should also be intelligent. At present, the man who is\r\nmost apt to regard himself as an intelligent critic of our political\r\naffairs is often the man who knows nothing whatever about them.\r\nCriticism which is ignorant or prejudiced is a source of great harm to\r\nthe nation; and where ignorant or prejudiced critics are themselves\r\neducated men, their attitude does real harm also to the class to which\r\nthey belong.\r\n\r\nThe tone of a portion of the press of the country toward public men,\r\nand especially toward political opponents, is degrading, all forms of\r\ncoarse and noisy slander being apparently considered legitimate weapons\r\nto employ against men of the opposite party or faction. Unfortunately,\r\nnot a few of the journals that pride themselves upon being independent\r\nin politics, and the organs of cultivated men, betray the same\r\ncharacteristics in a less coarse but quite as noxious form. All these\r\njournals do great harm by accustoming good citizens to see their public\r\nmen, good and bad, assailed indiscriminately as scoundrels. The effect\r\nis twofold: the citizen learning, on the one hand, to disbelieve\r\nany statement he sees in any newspaper, so that the attacks on evil\r\nlose their edge; and on the other, gradually acquiring a deep-rooted\r\nbelief that all public men are more or less bad. In consequence, his\r\npolitical instinct becomes hopelessly blurred, and he grows unable to\r\ntell the good representative from the bad. The worst offence that can\r\nbe committed against the Republic is the offence of the public man who\r\nbetrays his trust; but second only to it comes the offence of the man\r\nwho tries to persuade others that an honest and efficient public man\r\nis dishonest or unworthy. This is a wrong that can be committed in a\r\ngreat many different ways. Downright foul abuse may be, after all, less\r\ndangerous than incessant misstatements, sneers, and those half-truths\r\nthat are the meanest lies.\r\n\r\nFor educated men of weak fibre, there lies a real danger in that\r\nspecies of literary work which appeals to their cultivated senses\r\nbecause of its scholarly and pleasant tone, but which enjoins as the\r\nproper attitude to assume in public life one of mere criticism and\r\nnegation; which teaches the adoption toward public men and public\r\naffairs of that sneering tone which so surely denotes a mean and\r\nsmall mind. If a man does not have belief and enthusiasm, the chances\r\nare small indeed that he will ever do a man’s work in the world;\r\nand the paper or the college which, by its general course, tends to\r\neradicate this power of belief and enthusiasm, this desire for work,\r\nhas rendered to the young men under its influence the worst service it\r\ncould possibly render. Good can often be done by criticising sharply\r\nand severely the wrong; but excessive indulgence in criticism is never\r\nanything but bad, and no amount of criticism can in any way take the\r\nplace of active and zealous warfare for the right.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a certain tendency in college life, a tendency\r\nencouraged by some of the very papers referred to, to make educated\r\nmen shrink from contact with the rough people who do the world’s work,\r\nand associate only with one another and with those who think as they\r\ndo. This is a most dangerous tendency. It is very agreeable to deceive\r\none’s self into the belief that one is performing the whole duty of\r\nman by sitting at home in ease, doing nothing wrong, and confining\r\none’s participation in politics to conversations and meetings with men\r\nwho have had the same training and look at things in the same way. It\r\nis always a temptation to do this, because those who do nothing else\r\noften speak as if in some way they deserved credit for their attitude,\r\nand as if they stood above their brethren who plough the rough fields.\r\nMoreover, many people whose political work is done more or less\r\nafter this fashion are very noble and very sincere in their aims and\r\naspirations, and are striving for what is best and most decent in\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is a snare round which it behooves every young man\r\nto walk carefully. Let him beware of associating only with the people\r\nof his own caste and of his own little ways of political thought. Let\r\nhim learn that he must deal with the mass of men; that he must go out\r\nand stand shoulder to shoulder with his friends of every rank, and\r\nface to face with his foes of every rank, and must bear himself well\r\nin the hurly-burly. He must not be frightened by the many unpleasant\r\nfeatures of the contest, and he must not expect to have it all his\r\nown way, or to accomplish too much. He will meet with checks and will\r\nmake many mistakes; but if he perseveres, he will achieve a measure of\r\nsuccess and will do a measure of good such as is never possible to the\r\nrefined, cultivated, intellectual men who shrink aside from the actual\r\nfray.\r\n\r\nYet again, college men must learn to be as practical in politics as\r\nthey would be in business or in law. It is surely unnecessary to say\r\nthat by “practical” I do not mean anything that savors in the least\r\nof dishonesty. On the contrary, a college man is peculiarly bound to\r\nkeep a high ideal and to be true to it; but he must work in practical\r\nways to try to realize this ideal, and must not refuse to do anything\r\nbecause he cannot get everything. One especially necessary thing is to\r\nknow the facts by actual experience, and not to take refuge in mere\r\ntheorizing. There are always a number of excellent and well-meaning\r\nmen whom we grow to regard with amused impatience because they waste\r\nall their energies on some visionary scheme which, even if it were not\r\nvisionary, would be useless. When they come to deal with political\r\nquestions, these men are apt to err from sheer lack of familiarity with\r\nthe workings of our government. No man ever really learned from books\r\nhow to manage a governmental system. Books are admirable adjuncts, and\r\nthe statesman who has carefully studied them is far more apt to do good\r\nwork than if he had not; but if he has never done anything but study\r\nbooks he will not be a statesman at all. Thus, every young politician\r\nshould of course read the _Federalist_. It is the greatest book of\r\nthe kind that has ever been written. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay would\r\nhave been poorly equipped for writing it if they had not possessed an\r\nextensive acquaintance with literature, and in particular if they had\r\nnot been careful students of political literature; but the great cause\r\nof the value of their writings lay in the fact that they knew by actual\r\nwork and association what practical politics meant. They had helped to\r\nshape the political thought of the country, and to do its legislative\r\nand executive work, and so they were in a condition to speak\r\nunderstandingly about it. For similar reasons, Mr. Bryce’s _American\r\nCommonwealth_ has a value possessed by no other book of the kind,\r\nlargely because Mr. Bryce is himself an active member of Parliament,\r\na man of good standing and some leadership in his own party, and a\r\npractical politician. In the same way, a life of Washington by Cabot\r\nLodge, a sketch of Lincoln by Carl Schurz, a biography of Pitt by Lord\r\nRosebery, have an added value because of the writers’ own work in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nIt is always a pity to see men fritter away their energies on any\r\npointless scheme; and unfortunately, a good many of our educated people\r\nwhen they come to deal with politics, do just such frittering. Take,\r\nfor instance, the queer freak of arguing in favor of establishing\r\nwhat its advocates are pleased to call “responsible government” in\r\nour institutions, or in other words of grafting certain features\r\nof the English parliamentary system upon our own Presidential and\r\nCongressional system. This agitation was too largely deficient in\r\nbody to enable it to last, and it has now, I think, died away; but\r\nat one time quite a number of our men who spoke of themselves as\r\nstudents of political history were engaged in treating this scheme\r\nas something serious. Few men who had ever taken an active part in\r\npolitics, or who had studied politics in the way that a doctor is\r\nexpected to study surgery and medicine, so much as gave it a thought;\r\nbut very intelligent men did, just because they were misdirecting their\r\nenergies, and were wholly ignorant that they ought to know practically\r\nabout a problem before they attempted its solution. The English, or\r\nso-called “responsible,” theory of parliamentary government is one\r\nentirely incompatible with our own governmental institutions. It could\r\nnot be put into operation here save by absolutely sweeping away the\r\nUnited States Constitution. Incidentally, I may say it would be to\r\nthe last degree undesirable, if it were practicable. But this is not\r\nthe point upon which I wish to dwell; the point is that it was wholly\r\nimpracticable to put it into operation, and that an agitation favoring\r\nthis kind of government was from its nature unintelligent. The people\r\nwho wrote about it wasted their time, whereas they could have spent\r\nit to great advantage had they seriously studied our institutions and\r\nsought to devise practicable and desirable methods of increasing and\r\ncentring genuine responsibility--for all thinking men agree that there\r\nis an undoubted need for a change in this direction.\r\n\r\nBut of course much of the best work that has been done in the field of\r\npolitical study has been done by men who were not active politicians,\r\nthough they were careful and painstaking students of the phenomena\r\nof politics. The back numbers of our leading magazines afford proof\r\nof this. Certain of the governmental essays by such writers as Mr.\r\nLawrence Lowell and Professor A. B. Hart, and especially such books as\r\nthat on the _Speakers’ Powers and Duties_, by Miss Follet, have been\r\ngenuine and valuable contributions to our political thought. These\r\nessays have been studied carefully not only by scholars, but by men\r\nengaged in practical politics, because they were written with good\r\njudgment and keen insight after careful investigation of the facts, and\r\nso deserved respectful attention.\r\n\r\nIt is a misfortune for any people when the paths of the practical\r\nand the theoretical politicians diverge so widely that they have no\r\ncommon standing-ground. When the Greek thinkers began to devote their\r\nattention to purely visionary politics of the kind found in Plato’s\r\nRepublic, while the Greek practical politicians simply exploited the\r\nquarrelsome little commonwealths in their own interests, then the\r\nend of Greek liberty was at hand. No government that cannot command\r\nthe respectful support of the best thinkers is in an entirely sound\r\ncondition; but it is well to keep in mind the remark of Frederick\r\nthe Great, that if he wished to punish a province, he would allow it\r\nto be governed by the philosophers. It is a great misfortune for the\r\ncountry when the practical politician and the doctrinaire have no\r\npoint in common, but the misfortune is, if anything, greatest for the\r\ndoctrinaire. The ideal to be set before the student of politics and\r\nthe practical politician alike is the ideal of the _Federalist_. Each\r\nman should realize that he cannot do his best, either in the study\r\nof politics or in applied politics unless he has a working knowledge\r\nof both branches. A limited number of people can do good work by the\r\ncareful study of governmental institutions, but they can do it only\r\nif they have themselves a practical knowledge of the workings of\r\nthese institutions. A very large number of people, on the other hand,\r\nmay do excellent work in politics without much theoretic knowledge\r\nof the subject; but without this knowledge they cannot rise to the\r\nhighest rank, while in any rank their capacity to do good work will be\r\nimmensely increased if they have such knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other qualities, about which it is hardly necessary\r\nto speak. If an educated man is not heartily American in instinct\r\nand feeling and taste and sympathy, he will amount to nothing in our\r\npublic life. Patriotism, love of country, and pride in the flag which\r\nsymbolizes country may be feelings which the race will at some period\r\noutgrow, but at present they are very real and strong, and the man who\r\nlacks them is a useless creature, a mere incumbrance to the land.\r\n\r\nA man of sound political instincts can no more subscribe to the\r\ndoctrine of absolute independence of party on the one hand than to\r\nthat of unquestioning party allegiance on the other. No man can\r\naccomplish much unless he works in an organization with others, and\r\nthis organization, no matter how temporary, is a party for the time\r\nbeing. But that man is a dangerous citizen who so far mistakes means\r\nfor ends as to become servile in his devotion to his party, and afraid\r\nto leave it when the party goes wrong. To deify either independence or\r\nparty allegiance merely as such is a little absurd. It depends entirely\r\nupon the motive, the purpose, the result. For the last two years, the\r\nSenator who, beyond all his colleagues in the United States Senate, has\r\nshown himself independent of party ties is the very man to whom the\r\nleading champions of independence in politics most strenuously object.\r\nThe truth is, simply, that there are times when it may be the duty of a\r\nman to break with his party, and there are other times when it may be\r\nhis duty to stand by his party, even though, on some points, he thinks\r\nthat party wrong; he must be prepared to leave it when necessary,\r\nand he must not sacrifice his influence by leaving it unless it is\r\nnecessary. If we had no party allegiance, our politics would become\r\nmere windy anarchy, and, under present conditions, our government could\r\nhardly continue at all. If we had no independence, we should always be\r\nrunning the risk of the most degraded kind of despotism,--the despotism\r\nof the party boss and the party machine.\r\n\r\nIt is just the same way about compromises. Occasionally one hears some\r\nwell-meaning person say of another, apparently in praise, that he is\r\n“never willing to compromise.” It is a mere truism to say that, in\r\npolitics, there has to be one continual compromise. Of course now and\r\nthen questions arise upon which a compromise is inadmissible. There\r\ncould be no compromise with secession, and there was none. There should\r\nbe no avoidable compromise about any great moral question. But only a\r\nvery few great reforms or great measures of any kind can be carried\r\nthrough without concession. No student of American history needs to be\r\nreminded that the Constitution itself is a bundle of compromises, and\r\nwas adopted only because of this fact, and that the same thing is true\r\nof the Emancipation Proclamation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, then, the man with a university education is in honor\r\nbound to take an active part in our political life, and to do his\r\nfull duty as a citizen by helping his fellow-citizens to the extent\r\nof his power in the exercise of the rights of self-government. He is\r\nbound to rank action far above criticism, and to understand that the\r\nman deserving of credit is the man who actually does the things, even\r\nthough imperfectly, and not the man who confines himself to talking\r\nabout how they ought to be done. He is bound to have a high ideal and\r\nto strive to realize it, and yet he must make up his mind that he will\r\nnever be able to get the highest good, and that he must devote himself\r\nwith all his energy to getting the best that he can. Finally, his\r\nwork must be disinterested and honest, and it must be given without\r\nregard to his own success or failure, and without regard to the effect\r\nit has upon his own fortunes; and while he must show the virtues of\r\nuprightness and tolerance and gentleness, he must also show the sterner\r\nvirtues of courage, resolution, and hardihood, and the desire to war\r\nwith merciless effectiveness against the existence of wrong.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] _Atlantic Monthly_, August, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                    PHASES OF STATE LEGISLATION[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE ALBANY LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nFew persons realize the magnitude of the interests affected by\r\nState legislation in New York. It is no mere figure of speech to\r\ncall New York the Empire State; and many of the laws most directly\r\nand immediately affecting the interests of its citizens are passed\r\nat Albany, and not at Washington. In fact, there is at Albany a\r\nlittle home rule parliament which presides over the destinies of a\r\ncommonwealth more populous than any one of two thirds of the kingdoms\r\nof Europe, and one which, in point of wealth, material prosperity,\r\nvariety of interests, extent of territory, and capacity for expansion,\r\ncan fairly be said to rank next to the powers of the first class. This\r\nlittle parliament, composed of one hundred and twenty-eight members in\r\nthe Assembly and thirty-two in the Senate, is, in the fullest sense of\r\nthe term, a _representative_ body; there is hardly one of the many and\r\nwidely diversified interests of the State that has not a mouthpiece at\r\nAlbany, and hardly a single class of its citizens--not even excepting,\r\nI regret to say, the criminal class--which lacks its representative\r\namong the legislators. In the three Legislatures of which I have been\r\na member, I have sat with bankers and bricklayers, with merchants\r\nand mechanics, with lawyers, farmers, day-laborers, saloonkeepers,\r\nclergymen, and prize-fighters. Among my colleagues there were many very\r\ngood men; there was a still more numerous class of men who were neither\r\nvery good nor very bad, but went one way or the other, according to the\r\nstrength of the various conflicting influences acting around, behind,\r\nand upon them; and, finally, there were many very bad men. Still, the\r\nNew York Legislature, taken as a whole, is by no means as bad a body\r\nas we would be led to believe if our judgment was based purely on\r\nwhat we read in the great metropolitan papers; for the custom of the\r\nlatter is to portray things as either very much better or very much\r\nworse than they are. Where a number of men, many of them poor, some of\r\nthem unscrupulous, and others elected by constituents too ignorant to\r\nhold them to a proper accountability for their actions, are put into\r\na position of great temporary power, where they are called to take\r\naction upon questions affecting the welfare of large corporations and\r\nwealthy private individuals, the chances for corruption are always\r\ngreat; and that there is much viciousness and political dishonesty,\r\nmuch moral cowardice, and a good deal of actual bribe-taking in\r\nAlbany, no one who has had any practical experience of legislation can\r\ndoubt; but, at the same time, I think that the good members generally\r\noutnumber the bad, and that there is not often doubt as to the result\r\nwhen a naked question of right or wrong can be placed clearly and in\r\nits true light before the Legislature. The trouble is that on many\r\nquestions the Legislature never does have the right and wrong clearly\r\nshown it. Either some bold, clever parliamentary tactician snaps the\r\nmeasure through before the members are aware of its nature, or else\r\nthe obnoxious features are so combined with good ones as to procure\r\nthe support of a certain proportion of that large class of men whose\r\nintentions are excellent, but whose intellects are foggy. Or else the\r\nnecessary party organization, which we call the “machine,” uses its\r\ngreat power for some definite evil aim.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE CHARACTER OF THE REPRESENTATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe representatives from different sections of the State differ widely\r\nin character. Those from the country districts are generally very good\r\nmen. They are usually well-to-do farmers, small lawyers, or prosperous\r\nstore-keepers, and are shrewd, quiet, and honest. They are often\r\nnarrow-minded and slow to receive an idea; but, on the other hand, when\r\nthey get a good one, they cling to it with the utmost tenacity. They\r\nform very much the most valuable class of legislators. For the most\r\npart they are native Americans, and those who are not are men who\r\nhave become completely Americanized in all their ways and habits of\r\nthought. One of the most useful members of the last Legislature was a\r\nGerman from a western county, and the extent of his Americanization can\r\nbe judged from the fact that he was actually an ardent prohibitionist:\r\ncertainly no one who knows Teutonic human nature will require further\r\nproof. Again, I sat for an entire session beside a very intelligent\r\nmember from northern New York before I discovered that he was an\r\nIrishman: all his views of legislation, even upon such subjects as free\r\nschools and the impropriety of making appropriations from the treasury\r\nfor the support of sectarian institutions, were precisely similar to\r\nthose of his Protestant-American neighbors, though he was himself a\r\nCatholic. Now a German or an Irishman from one of the great cities\r\nwould probably have retained many of his national peculiarities.\r\n\r\nIt is from these same great cities that the worst legislators come.\r\nIt is true that there are always among them a few cultivated and\r\nscholarly men who are well educated, and who stand on a higher and\r\nbroader intellectual and moral plane than the country members, but the\r\nbulk are very low indeed. They are usually foreigners, of little or no\r\neducation, with exceedingly misty ideas as to morality, and possessed\r\nof an ignorance so profound that it could only be called comic, were\r\nit not for the fact that it has at times such serious effects upon our\r\nlaws. It is their ignorance, quite as much as actual viciousness,\r\nwhich makes it so difficult to procure the passage of good laws or\r\nprevent the passage of bad ones; and it is the most irritating of the\r\nmany elements with which we have to contend in the fight for good\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DARK SIDE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PICTURE.\r\n\r\nMention has been made above of the bribe-taking which undoubtedly at\r\ntimes occurs in the New York Legislature. This is what is commonly\r\ncalled “a delicate subject” with which to deal, and, therefore,\r\naccording to our usual methods of handling delicate subjects, it is\r\neither never discussed at all, or else discussed with the grossest\r\nexaggeration; but most certainly there is nothing about which it is\r\nmore important to know the truth.\r\n\r\nIn each of the last three legislatures there were a number of us who\r\nwere interested in getting through certain measures which we deemed\r\nto be for the public good, but which were certain to be strongly\r\nopposed, some for political and some for pecuniary reasons. Now, to\r\nget through any such measure requires genuine hard work, a certain\r\namount of parliamentary skill, a good deal of tact and courage, and\r\nabove all, a thorough knowledge of the men with whom one has to deal,\r\nand of the motives which actuate them. In other words, before taking\r\nany active steps, we had to “size up” our fellow-legislators, to\r\nfind out their past history and present character and associates, to\r\nfind out whether they were their own masters or were acting under\r\nthe directions of somebody else, whether they were bright or stupid,\r\netc., etc. As a result, and after very careful study, conducted\r\npurely with the object of learning the truth, so that we might work\r\nmore effectually, we came to the conclusion that about a third of the\r\nmembers were open to corrupt influences in some form or other; in\r\ncertain sessions the proportion was greater, and in some less. Now it\r\nwould, of course, be impossible for me or for anyone else to prove in\r\na court of law that these men were guilty, except perhaps in two or\r\nthree cases; yet we felt absolutely confident that there was hardly\r\na case in which our judgment as to the honesty of any given member\r\nwas not correct. The two or three exceptional cases alluded to, where\r\nlegal proof of guilt might have been forthcoming, were instances in\r\nwhich honest men were approached by their colleagues at times when\r\nthe need for votes was very great; but, even then, it would have been\r\nalmost impossible to punish the offenders before a court, for it would\r\nhave merely resulted in his denying what his accuser stated. Moreover,\r\nthe members who had been approached would have been very reluctant\r\nto come forward, for each of them felt ashamed that his character\r\nshould not have been well enough known to prevent anyone’s daring to\r\nspeak to him on such a subject. And another reason why the few honest\r\nmen who are approached (for the lobbyist rarely makes a mistake in\r\nhis estimate of the men who will be apt to take bribes) do not feel\r\nlike taking action in the matter is that a doubtful lawsuit will\r\ncertainly follow, which will drag on so long that the public will come\r\nto regard all of the participants with equal distrust, while in the\r\nend the decision is quite as likely to be against as to be for them.\r\nTake the Bradly-Sessions case, for example. This was an incident that\r\noccurred at the time of the faction-fight in the Republican ranks\r\nover the return of Mr. Conkling to the United States Senate after his\r\nresignation from that body. Bradly, an Assemblyman, accused Sessions,\r\na State Senator, of attempting to bribe him. The affair dragged on for\r\nan indefinite time; no one was able actually to determine whether it\r\nwas a case of blackmail on the one hand, or of bribery on the other;\r\nthe vast majority of people recollected the names of both parties, but\r\ntotally forgot which it was that was supposed to have bribed the other,\r\nand regarded both with equal disfavor; and the upshot has been that the\r\ncase is now merely remembered as illustrating one of the most unsavory\r\nphases of the once-famous Halfbreed-Stalwart fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n         DIFFICULTIES OF PREVENTING AND PUNISHING CORRUPTION.\r\n\r\nFrom the causes indicated, it is almost impossible to actually convict\r\na legislator of bribe-taking; but at the same time, the character of a\r\nlegislator, if bad, soon becomes a matter of common notoriety, and no\r\ndishonest legislator can long keep his reputation good with honest men.\r\nIf the constituents wish to know the character of their member, they\r\ncan easily find it out, and no member will be dishonest if he thinks\r\nhis constituents are looking at him; he presumes upon their ignorance\r\nor indifference. I do not see how bribe-taking among legislators can\r\nbe stopped until the public conscience becomes awake to the matter.\r\nThen it will stop fast enough; for just as soon as politicians realize\r\nthat the people are in earnest in wanting a thing done, they make haste\r\nto do it. The trouble is always in rousing the people sufficiently\r\nto make them take an _effective_ interest,--that is, in making them\r\nsufficiently in earnest to be willing to give a little of their time to\r\nthe accomplishment of the object they have in view.\r\n\r\nMuch the largest percentage of corrupt legislators come from the\r\ngreat cities; indeed, the majority of the assemblymen from the great\r\ncities are “very poor specimens” indeed, while, on the contrary, the\r\ncongressmen who go from them are generally pretty good men. This fact\r\nis only one of the many which go to establish the curious political\r\nlaw that in a great city the larger the constituency which elects a\r\npublic servant, the more apt that servant is to be a good one; exactly\r\nas the Mayor is almost certain to be infinitely superior in character\r\nto the average alderman, or the average city judge to the average\r\ncivil justice. This is because the public servants of comparatively\r\nsmall importance are protected by their own insignificance from the\r\nconsequences of their bad actions. Life is carried on at such a high\r\npressure in the great cities, men’s time is so fully occupied by their\r\nmanifold and harassing interests and duties, and their knowledge of\r\ntheir neighbors is necessarily so limited, that they are only able\r\nto fix in their minds the characters and records of a few prominent\r\nmen; the others they lump together without distinguishing between\r\nindividuals. They know whether the aldermen, as a body, are to be\r\nadmired or despised; but they probably do not even know the name,\r\nfar less the worth, of the particular aldermen who represents their\r\ndistrict; so it happens that their votes for aldermen or assemblymen\r\nare generally given with very little intelligence indeed, while, on the\r\ncontrary, they are fully competent to pass and execute judgment upon\r\nas prominent an official as a mayor or even a congressman. Hence it\r\nfollows that the latter have to give a good deal of attention to the\r\nwishes and prejudices of the public at large, while a city assemblyman,\r\nthough he always talks a great deal about the people, rarely, except in\r\ncertain extraordinary cases, has to pay much heed to their wants. His\r\npolitical future depends far more upon the skill and success with which\r\nhe cultivates the good-will of certain “bosses,” or of certain cliques\r\nof politicians, or even of certain bodies and knots of men (such as\r\ncompose a trade-union, or a collection of merchants in some special\r\nbusiness, or the managers of a railroad) whose interests, being vitally\r\naffected by Albany legislation, oblige them closely to watch, and to\r\ntry to punish or reward, the Albany legislators. These politicians\r\nor sets of interested individuals generally care very little for a\r\nman’s honesty so long as he can be depended upon to do as they wish on\r\ncertain occasions; and hence it often happens that a dishonest man who\r\nhas sense enough not to excite attention by any flagrant outrage may\r\ncontinue for a number of years to represent an honest constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE CONSTITUENTS LARGELY TO BLAME.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a member from a large city can often count upon the educated\r\nand intelligent men of his district showing the most gross ignorance\r\nand stupidity in political affairs. The much-lauded intelligent\r\nvoter--the man of cultured mind, liberal education, and excellent\r\nintentions--at times performs exceedingly queer antics.\r\n\r\nThe great public meetings to advance certain political movements\r\nirrespective of party, which have been held so frequently during the\r\npast few years, have undoubtedly done a vast amount of good; but the\r\nvery men who attend these public meetings and inveigh against the\r\nfolly and wickedness of the politicians will sometimes on election\r\nday do things which have quite as evil effects as any of the acts of\r\nthe men whom they very properly condemn. A recent instance of this is\r\nworth giving. In 1882 there was in the Assembly a young member from\r\nNew York, who did as hard and effective work for the city of New York\r\nas has ever been done by anyone. It was a peculiarly disagreeable year\r\nto be in the Legislature. The composition of that body was unusually\r\nbad. The more disreputable politicians relied upon it to pass some\r\nof their schemes and to protect certain of their members from the\r\nconsequences of their own misdeeds. Demagogic measures were continually\r\nbrought forward, nominally in the interests of the laboring classes,\r\nfor which an honest and intelligent man could not vote, and yet which\r\nwere jealously watched by, and received the hearty support of, not\r\nmere demagogues and agitators, but also a large number of perfectly\r\nhonest though misguided workingmen. And, finally, certain wealthy\r\ncorporations attempted, by the most unscrupulous means, to rush through\r\na number of laws in their own interest. The young member of whom we are\r\nspeaking incurred by his course on these various measures the bitter\r\nhostility alike of the politicians, the demagogues, and the members of\r\nthat most dangerous of all classes, the wealthy criminal class. He had\r\nalso earned the gratitude of all honest citizens, and he got it--as\r\nfar as words went. The better class of newspapers spoke well of him;\r\ncultured and intelligent men generally--the well-to-do, prosperous\r\npeople who belong to the different social and literary clubs, and their\r\nfollowers--were loud in his praise. I call to mind one man who lived\r\nin his district who expressed great indignation that the politicians\r\nshould dare to oppose his re-election; when told that it was to be\r\nhoped he would help to insure the legislator’s return to Albany by\r\nhimself staying at the polls all day, he answered that he was very\r\nsorry, but he unfortunately had an engagement to go quail-shooting on\r\nelection day! Most respectable people, however, would undoubtedly\r\nhave voted for and re-elected the young member had it not been for the\r\nunexpected political movements that took place in the fall. A citizens’\r\nticket, largely non-partisan in character, was run for certain local\r\noffices, receiving its support from among those who claimed to be,\r\nand who undoubtedly were, the best men of both parties. The ticket\r\ncontained the names of candidates only for municipal offices, and had\r\nnothing whatever to do with the election of men to the Legislature; yet\r\nit proved absolutely impossible to drill this simple fact through the\r\nheads of a great many worthy people, who, when election day came round,\r\ndeclined to vote anything but the citizens’ ticket, and persisted in\r\nthinking that if no legislative candidate was on the ticket, it was\r\nbecause, for some reason or other, the citizens’ committee did not\r\nconsider any legislative candidate worth voting for. All over the city\r\nthe better class of candidates for legislative offices lost from this\r\ncause votes which they had a right to expect, and in the particular\r\ndistrict under consideration the loss was so great as to cause the\r\ndefeat of the sitting member, or rather to elect him by so narrow a\r\nvote as to enable an unscrupulously partisan legislative majority to\r\nkeep him out of his seat.\r\n\r\nIt is this kind of ignorance of the simplest political matters among\r\nreally good citizens, combined with their timidity, which is so apt\r\nto characterize a wealthy _bourgeoisie_, and with their short-sighted\r\nselfishness in being unwilling to take the smallest portion of time\r\naway from their business or pleasure to devote to public affairs,\r\nwhich renders it so easy for corrupt men from the city to keep their\r\nplaces in the Legislature. In the country the case is different.\r\nHere the constituencies, who are usually composed of honest though\r\nnarrow-minded and bigoted individuals, generally keep a pretty sharp\r\nlookout on their members, and, as already said, the latter are apt to\r\nbe fairly honest men. Even when they are not honest, they take good\r\ncare to act perfectly well as regards all district matters, for most\r\nof the measures about which corrupt influences are at work relate to\r\ncity affairs. The constituents of a country member know well how to\r\njudge him for those of his acts which immediately affect themselves;\r\nbut as regards others they often have no means of forming an opinion,\r\nexcept through the newspapers,--more especially through the great\r\nmetropolitan newspapers,--and they have gradually come to look upon\r\nall statements made by the latter with reference to the honesty or\r\ndishonesty of public men with extreme distrust. This is because our\r\nnewspapers, including those who professedly stand as representatives\r\nof the highest culture of the community, have been in the habit of\r\nmaking such constant and reckless assaults upon the characters of even\r\nvery good public men, as to greatly detract from their influence when\r\nthey attack one who is really bad. They paint everyone with whom they\r\ndisagree black. As a consequence the average man, who knows they are\r\npartly wrong, thinks they may also be partly right; he concludes that\r\nno man is absolutely white, and at the same time that no one is as\r\nblack as he is painted; and takes refuge in the belief that all alike\r\nare gray. It then becomes impossible to rouse him to make an effort\r\neither for a good man or against a scoundrel. Nothing helps dishonest\r\npoliticians as much as this feeling; and among the chief instruments in\r\nits production we must number certain of our newspapers who are loudest\r\nin asserting that they stand on the highest moral plane. As for the\r\nother newspapers, those of frankly “sensational” character, such as\r\nthe two which at present claim to have the largest circulation in New\r\nYork, there is small need to characterize them; they form a very great\r\npromotive to public corruption and private vice, and are on the whole\r\nthe most potent of all the forces for evil which are at work in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PERILS OF LEGISLATIVE LIFE.\r\n\r\nHowever, there can be no question that a great many men do deteriorate\r\nvery much morally when they go to Albany. The last accusation most of\r\nus would think of bringing against that dear, dull, old Dutch city is\r\nthat of being a fast place; and yet there are plenty of members coming\r\nfrom out-of-the-way villages or quiet country towns on whom Albany has\r\nas bad an effect as Paris sometimes has on wealthy young Americans from\r\nthe great sea-board cities. Many men go to the Legislature with the set\r\npurpose of making money; but many others, who afterwards become bad,\r\ngo there intending to do good work. These latter may be well-meaning,\r\nweak young fellows of some shallow brightness, who expect to make names\r\nfor themselves; perhaps they are young lawyers, or real-estate brokers,\r\nor small shop-keepers; they achieve but little success; they gradually\r\nbecome conscious that their business is broken up, and that they have\r\nnot enough ability to warrant any expectation of their continuing in\r\npublic life; some great temptation comes in their way (a corporation\r\nwhich expects to be relieved of perhaps a million dollars of taxes by\r\nthe passage of a bill can afford to pay high for voters); they fall,\r\nand that is the end of them. Indeed, legislative life has temptations\r\nenough to make it unadvisable for any weak man, whether young or old,\r\nto enter it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALLIES OF VICIOUS LEGISLATORS.\r\n\r\nThe array of vicious legislators is swelled by a number of men who\r\nreally at bottom are not bad. Foremost among these are those most\r\nhopeless of beings who are handicapped by having some measure which\r\nthey consider it absolutely necessary for the sake of their own future\r\nto “get through.” One of these men will have a bill, for instance,\r\nappropriating a sum of money from the State Treasury to clear out a\r\nriver, dam the outlet of a lake, or drain a marsh; it may be, although\r\nnot usually so, proper enough in itself, but it is drawn up primarily\r\nin the interest of a certain set of his constituents who have given\r\nhim clearly to understand that his continuance in their good graces\r\ndepends upon his success in passing the bill. He feels that he must\r\nget it through at all hazards; the bad men find this out, and tell him\r\nhe must count on their opposition unless he consents also to help their\r\nmeasures; he resists at first, but sooner or later yields; and from\r\nthat moment his fate is sealed,--so far as his ability to do any work\r\nof general good is concerned.\r\n\r\nA still larger number of men are good enough in themselves, but are\r\n“owned” by third parties. Usually the latter are politicians who have\r\nabsolute control of the district machine, or who are, at least, of\r\nvery great importance in the political affairs of their district. A\r\ncurious fact is that they are not invariably, though usually, of the\r\nsame party as the member; for in some places, especially in the lower\r\nportions of the great cities, politics become purely a business, and\r\nin the squabbles for offices of emolument it becomes important for a\r\nlocal leader to have supporters among all the factions. When one of\r\nthese supporters is sent to a legislative body, he is allowed to act\r\nwith the rest of his party on what his chief regards as the unimportant\r\nquestions of party or public interest, but he has to come in to heel at\r\nonce when any matter arises touching the said chief’s power, pocket, or\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nOther members will be controlled by some wealthy private citizen who is\r\nnot in politics, but who has business interests likely to be affected\r\nby legislation, and who is therefore, willing to subscribe heavily to\r\nthe campaign expenses of an individual or of an association so as to\r\ninsure the presence in Albany of someone who will give him information\r\nand assistance.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion there came before a committee of which I happened to\r\nbe a member, a perfectly proper bill in the interest of a certain\r\ncorporation; the majority of the committee, six in number, were\r\nthoroughly bad men, who opposed the measure with the hope of being paid\r\nto cease their opposition. When I consented to take charge of the bill,\r\nI had stipulated that not a penny should be paid to insure its passage.\r\nIt therefore became necessary to see what pressure could be brought\r\nto bear on the recalcitrant members; and, accordingly, we had to find\r\nout who were the authors and sponsors of their political being. Three\r\nproved to be under the control of local statesmen of the same party\r\nas themselves, and of equally bad moral character; one was ruled by a\r\npolitician of unsavory reputation from a different city; the fifth, a\r\nDemocrat, was owned by a Republican Federal official; and the sixth by\r\nthe president of a horse-car company. A couple of letters from these\r\ntwo magnates forced the last members mentioned to change front on the\r\nbill with surprising alacrity.\r\n\r\nNowadays, however, the greatest danger is that the member will be a\r\nservile tool of the “boss” or “machine” of his own party, in which case\r\nhe can very rarely indeed be a good public servant.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of cases in which corrupt members get money. One\r\nis when a wealthy corporation buys through some measure which will be\r\nof great benefit to itself, although, perhaps an injury to the public\r\nat large; the other is when a member introduces a bill hostile to\r\nsome moneyed interest, with the expectation of being paid to let the\r\nmatter drop. The latter, technically called a “strike,” is much the\r\nmost common; for, in spite of the outcry against them in legislative\r\nmatters, corporations are more often sinned against than sinning. It\r\nis difficult, for reasons already given, in either case to convict the\r\noffending member, though we have very good laws against bribery. The\r\nreform has got to come from the people at large. It will be hard to\r\nmake any very great improvement in the character of the legislators\r\nuntil respectable people become more fully awake to their duties, and\r\nuntil the newspapers become more truthful and less reckless in their\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nIt is not a pleasant task to have to draw one side of legislative life\r\nin such dark colors; but as the side exists, and as the dark lines\r\nnever can be rubbed out until we have manfully acknowledged that they\r\nare there and need rubbing out, it seems the falsest of false delicacy\r\nto refrain from dwelling upon them. But it would be most unjust to\r\naccept this partial truth as being the whole truth. We blame the\r\nLegislature for many evils, the ultimate cause for whose existence is\r\nto be found in our own shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PICTURE.\r\n\r\nThere is a much brighter side to the picture, and this is the larger\r\nside, too. It would be impossible to get together a body of more\r\nearnest, upright, and disinterested men than the band of legislators,\r\nlargely young men, who during the past three years have averted so\r\nmuch evil and accomplished so much good at Albany. They were able, at\r\nleast partially, to put into actual practice the theories that had long\r\nbeen taught by the intellectual leaders of the country. And the life\r\nof a legislator who is earnest in his efforts faithfully to perform\r\nhis duty as a public servant, is harassing and laborious to the last\r\ndegree. He is kept at work from eight to fourteen hours a day; he is\r\nobliged to incur the bitterest hostility of a body of men as powerful\r\nas they are unscrupulous, who are always on the watch to find out, or\r\nto make out, anything in his private or his public life which can be\r\nused against him; and he has on his side either a but partially roused\r\npublic opinion, or else a public opinion roused, it is true, but only\r\nblindly conscious of the evil from which it suffers, and alike ignorant\r\nand unwilling to avail itself of the proper remedy.\r\n\r\nThis body of legislators, who, at any rate, worked honestly for what\r\nthey thought right, were, as a whole, quite unselfish, and were not\r\ntreated particularly well by their constituents. Most of them soon got\r\nto realize the fact that if they wished to enjoy their brief space of\r\npolitical life (and most though not all of them did enjoy it) they\r\nwould have to make it a rule never to consider, in deciding how to vote\r\nupon any question, how their vote would affect their own political\r\nprospects. No man can do good service in the Legislature as long as he\r\nis worrying over the effect of his actions upon his own future. After\r\nhaving learned this, most of them got on very happily indeed. As a\r\nrule, and where no matter of vital principle is involved, a member is\r\nbound to represent the views of those who have elected him; but there\r\nare times when the voice of the people is anything but the voice of\r\nGod, and then a conscientious man is equally bound to disregard it.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, and on the average, the public will usually do\r\njustice to its representatives; but it is a very rough, uneven, and\r\nlong-delayed justice. That is, judging from what I have myself seen of\r\nthe way in which members were treated by their constituents, I should\r\nsay that the chances of an honest man being retained in public life\r\nwere about ten per cent. better than if he were dishonest, other things\r\nbeing equal. This is not a showing very creditable to us as a people;\r\nand the explanation is to be found in the shortcomings peculiar to the\r\ndifferent classes of our honest and respectable voters,--shortcomings\r\nwhich may be briefly outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SHORTCOMINGS OF THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD TAKE PART IN POLITICAL WORK.\r\n\r\nThe people of means in all great cities have in times past shamefully\r\nneglected their political duties, and have been contemptuously\r\ndisregarded by the professional politicians in consequence. A number\r\nof them will get together in a large hall, will vociferously demand\r\n“reform,” as if it were some concrete substance which could be handed\r\nout to them in slices, and will then disband with a feeling of the\r\nmost serene self-satisfaction, and the belief that they have done their\r\nentire duty as citizens and members of the community. It is an actual\r\nfact that four out of five of our wealthy and educated men, of those\r\nwho occupy what is called good social position, are really ignorant of\r\nthe nature of a caucus or a primary meeting, and never attend either.\r\nNow, under our form of government, no man can accomplish anything by\r\nhimself; he must work in combination with others; and the men of whom\r\nwe are speaking will never carry their proper weight in the political\r\naffairs of the country until they have formed themselves into some\r\norganization, or else, which would be better, have joined some of\r\nthe organizations already existing. But there seems often to be a\r\ncertain lack of the robuster virtues in our educated men, which makes\r\nthem shrink from the struggle and the inevitable contact with rough\r\npoliticians (who must often be rudely handled before they can be forced\r\nto behave); while their lack of familiarity with their surroundings\r\ncauses them to lack discrimination between the politicians who are\r\ndecent, and those who are not; for in their eyes the two classes both\r\nequally unfamiliar, are indistinguishable. Another reason why this\r\nclass is not of more consequence in politics, is that it is often\r\nreally out of sympathy--or, at least, its more conspicuous members\r\nare--with the feelings and interests of the great mass of the American\r\npeople; and it is a discreditable fact that it is in this class that\r\nwhat has been most aptly termed the “colonial” spirit still survives.\r\nUntil this survival of the spirit of colonial dependence is dead,\r\nthose in whom it exists will serve chiefly as laughing-stocks to the\r\nshrewd, humorous, and prejudiced people who form nine tenths of our\r\nbody-politic, and whose chief characteristics are their intensely\r\nAmerican habits of thought, and their surly intolerance of anything\r\nlike subservience to outside and foreign influences.\r\n\r\nFrom different causes, the laboring classes, even when thoroughly\r\nhonest at heart, often fail to appreciate honesty in their\r\nrepresentatives. They are frequently not well informed in regard\r\nto the character of the latter, and they are apt to be led aside\r\nby the loud professions of the so-called labor reformers, who are\r\nalways promising to procure by legislation the advantages which can\r\nonly come to working men, or to any other men, by their individual\r\nor united energy, intelligence, and forethought. Very much has been\r\naccomplished by legislation for laboring men, by procuring mechanics’\r\nlien laws, factory laws, etc.; and hence it often comes that they\r\nthink legislation can accomplish all things for them; and it is only\r\nnatural, for instance, that a certain proportion of their number\r\nshould adhere to the demagogue who votes for a law to double the rate\r\nof wages, rather than to the honest man who opposes it. When people\r\nare struggling for the necessaries of existence, and vaguely feel, no\r\nmatter how wrongly, that they are also struggling against an unjustly\r\nordered system of life, it is hard to convince them of the truth that\r\nan ounce of performance on their own part is worth a ton of legislative\r\npromises to change in some mysterious manner that life-system.\r\n\r\nIn the country districts justice to a member is somewhat more apt to\r\nbe done. When, as is so often the case, it is not done, the cause is\r\nusually to be sought for in the numerous petty jealousies and local\r\nrivalries which are certain to exist in any small community whose\r\ninterests are narrow and most of whose members are acquainted with each\r\nother; and besides this, our country vote is essentially a Bourbon or\r\nTory vote, being very slow to receive new ideas, very tenacious of old\r\nones, and hence inclined to look with suspicion upon any one who tries\r\nto shape his course according to some standard differing from that\r\nwhich is already in existence.\r\n\r\nThe actual work of procuring the passage of a bill through the\r\nLegislature is in itself far from slight. The hostility of the actively\r\nbad has to be discounted in advance, and the indifference of the\r\npassive majority, who are neither very good nor very bad, has to be\r\novercome. This can usually be accomplished only by stirring up their\r\nconstituencies; and so, besides the constant watchfulness over the\r\ncourse of the measure through both houses and the continual debating\r\nand parliamentary fencing which is necessary, it is also indispensable\r\nto get the people of districts not directly affected by the bill alive\r\nto its importance, so as to induce their representatives to vote for\r\nit. Thus, when the bill to establish a State Park at Niagara was\r\non its passage, it was found that the great majority of the country\r\nmembers were opposed to it, fearing that it might conceal some\r\nland-jobbing scheme, and also fearing that their constituents, whose\r\nvice is not extravagance, would not countenance so great an expenditure\r\nof public money. It was of no use arguing with the members, and instead\r\nthe country newspapers were flooded with letters, pamphlets were\r\ncirculated, visits and personal appeals were made, until a sufficient\r\nnumber of these members changed front to enable us to get the lacking\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LIFE IN THE LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\nAs already said, some of us who usually acted together took a great\r\ndeal of genuine enjoyment out of our experience at Albany. We liked\r\nthe excitement and perpetual conflict, the necessity for putting forth\r\nall our powers to reach our ends, and the feeling that we were really\r\nbeing of some use in the world; and if we were often both saddened and\r\nangered by the viciousness and ignorance of some of our colleagues,\r\nyet, in return, the latter many times unwittingly furnished us a good\r\ndeal of amusement by their preposterous actions and speeches. Some\r\nof these are worth repeating, though they can never, in repetition,\r\nseem what they were when they occurred. The names and circumstances,\r\nof course, have been so changed as to prevent the possibility of the\r\nreal heroes of them being recognized. It must be understood that\r\nthey stand for the exceptional and not the ordinary workings of the\r\naverage legislative intellect. I have heard more sound sense than\r\nfoolishness talked in Albany, but to record the former would only bore\r\nthe reader. And we must bear in mind that while the ignorance of some\r\nof our representatives warrants our saying that they should not be in\r\nthe Legislature, it does not at all warrant our condemning the system\r\nof government which permits them to be sent there. There is no system\r\nso good that it has not some disadvantages. The only way to teach our\r\nforeign-born fellow-citizens how to govern themselves, is to give each\r\nthe full rights possessed by other American citizens; and it is not\r\nto be wondered at if they at first show themselves unskilful in the\r\nexercise of these rights. It has been my experience moreover in the\r\nLegislature that when Hans or Paddy does turn out really well, there\r\nare very few native Americans indeed who do better. A very large number\r\nof the ablest and most disinterested and public-spirited citizens in\r\nNew York are by birth Germans; and their names are towers of strength\r\nin the community. When I had to name a committee which was to do the\r\nmost difficult, dangerous, and important work that came before the\r\nLegislature at all during my presence in it, I chose three of my four\r\ncolleagues from among those of my fellow-legislators who were Irish\r\neither by birth or descent. One of the warmest and most disinterested\r\nfriends I have ever had or hope to have in New York politics, is by\r\nbirth an Irishman, and is also as genuine and good an American citizen\r\nas is to be found within the United States.\r\n\r\nA good many of the Yankees in the house would blunder time and again;\r\nbut their blunders were generally merely stupid and not at all amusing,\r\nwhile, on the contrary, the errors of those who were of Milesian\r\nextraction always possessed a most refreshing originality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 INCIDENTS OF LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the Democrats in the house had a clear majority, but were for\r\na long time unable to effect an organization, owing to a faction-fight\r\nin their own ranks between the Tammany and anti-Tammany members,\r\neach side claiming the lion’s share of the spoils. After a good\r\ndeal of bickering, the anti-Tammany men drew up a paper containing\r\na series of propositions, and submitted it to their opponents, with\r\nthe prefatory remark, in writing, that it was an _ultimatum_. The\r\nTammany members were at once summoned to an indignation meeting, their\r\nfeelings closely resembling those of the famous fish-wife who was\r\ncalled a parallelopipedon. None of them had any very accurate idea\r\nas to what the word _ultimatum_ meant; but that it was intensively\r\noffensive, not to say abusive, in its nature, they did not question\r\nfor a moment. It was felt that some equivalent and equally strong term\r\nby which to call Tammany’s proposed counter-address must be found\r\nimmediately; but, as the Latin vocabulary of the members was limited,\r\nit was some time before a suitable term was forthcoming. Finally, by\r\na happy inspiration, some gentlemen of classical education remembered\r\nthe phrase _ipse dixit_; it was at once felt to be the very phrase\r\nrequired by the peculiar exigencies of the case, and next day the reply\r\nappeared, setting forth with well-satisfied gravity that, in response\r\nto the County Democracy’s “_ultimatum_,” Tammany herewith produced her\r\n“_ipse dixit_.”\r\n\r\nPublic servants of higher grade than aldermen or assemblymen sometimes\r\ngive words a wider meaning than would be found in the dictionary.\r\nIn many parts of the United States, owing to a curious series of\r\nhistorical associations (which, by the way, it would be interesting\r\nto trace), anything foreign and un-English is called “Dutch,” and it\r\nwas in this sense that a member of a recent Congress used the term\r\nwhen, in speaking in favor of a tariff on works of art, he told of the\r\nreluctance with which he saw the productions of native artists exposed\r\nto competition “with Dutch daubs from Italy”; a sentence pleasing\r\nalike from its alliteration and from its bold disregard of geographic\r\ntrivialties.\r\n\r\nOften an orator of this sort will have his attention attracted by\r\nsome high-sounding word, which he has not before seen, and which he\r\ntreasures up to use in his next rhetorical flight, without regard to\r\nthe exact meaning. There was a laboring man’s advocate in the last\r\nLegislature, one of whose efforts attracted a good deal of attention\r\nfrom his magnificent heedlessness of technical accuracy in the use of\r\nsimiles. He was speaking against the convict contract-labor system,\r\nand wound up an already sufficiently remarkable oration with the\r\nstill more startling ending that the system “was a vital cobra which\r\nwas swamping the lives of the laboring men.” Now, he had evidently\r\ncarefully put together the sentence beforehand, and the process of\r\nmental synthesis by which he built it up must have been curious.\r\n“Vital” was, of course, used merely as an adjective of intensity; he\r\nwas a little uncertain in his ideas as to what a “cobra” was, but took\r\nit for granted that it was some terrible manifestation of nature,\r\npossibly hostile to man, like a volcano, or a cyclone, or Niagara,\r\nfor instance; then “swamping” was chosen as describing an operation\r\nvery likely to be performed by Niagara, or a cyclone, or a cobra; and\r\nbehold, the sentence was complete.\r\n\r\nSometimes a common phrase will be given a new meaning. Thus, the mass\r\nof legislation is strictly local in its character. Over a thousand\r\nbills come up for consideration in the course of a session, but a very\r\nfew of which affect the interests of the State at large. The latter\r\nand the more important private bills are, or ought to be, carefully\r\nstudied by each member; but it is a physical impossibility for any\r\none man to examine the countless local bills of small importance. For\r\nthese we have to trust to the member for the district affected, and\r\nwhen one comes up the response to any inquiry about it is usually, “Oh,\r\nit’s a local bill, affecting so-and-so’s district; he is responsible\r\nfor it.” By degrees, some of the members get to use “local” in the\r\nsense of unimportant, and a few of the assemblymen of doubtful honesty\r\ngradually come to regard it as meaning a bill of no pecuniary interest\r\nto themselves. There was a smug little rascal in one of the last\r\nlegislatures, who might have come out of one of Lever’s novels. He\r\nwas undoubtedly a bad case, but had a genuine sense of humor, and his\r\n“bulls” made him the delight of the house. One day I came in late,\r\njust as a bill was being voted on, and meeting my friend, hailed him,\r\n“Hello, Pat, what’s up? what’s this they’re voting on?” to which Pat\r\nreplied, with contemptuous indifference to the subject, but with a sly\r\ntwinkle in his eye, “Oh, some unimportant measure, sorr; some local\r\nbill or other--_a constitutional amendment_!”\r\n\r\nThe old Dublin Parliament never listened to a better specimen of a bull\r\nthan was contained in the speech of a very genial and pleasant friend\r\nof mine, a really finished orator, who, in the excitement attendant\r\nupon receiving Governor Cleveland’s message vetoing the five-cent-fare\r\nbill, uttered the following sentence: “Mr. Speaker, I recognize the\r\nhand that crops out in that veto; _I have heard it before_!”\r\n\r\nOne member rather astonished us one day by his use of the word\r\n“shibboleth.” He had evidently concluded that this was merely a more\r\nelegant synonym of the good old word shillalah, and in reproving a\r\ncolleague for opposing a bill to increase the salaries of public\r\nlaborers, he said, very impressively, “The throuble wid the young man\r\nis, that he uses the wurrd economy as a shibboleth, wherewith to strike\r\nthe working man.” Afterwards he changed the metaphor, and spoke of a\r\nnumber of us as using the word “reform” as a shibboleth, behind which\r\nto cloak our evil intentions.\r\n\r\nA mixture of classical and constitutional misinformation was displayed\r\na few sessions past in the State Assembly when I was a member of the\r\nLegislature. It was on the occasion of that annual nuisance, the debate\r\nupon the Catholic Protectory item of the Supply Bill. Every year\r\nsome one who is desirous of bidding for the Catholic vote introduces\r\nthis bill, which appropriates a sum of varying dimensions for the\r\nsupport of the Catholic Protectory, an excellent institution, but one\r\nwhich has no right whatever to come to the State for support; each\r\nyear the insertion of the item is opposed by a small number of men,\r\nincluding the more liberal Catholics themselves, on proper grounds,\r\nand by a larger number from simple bigotry--a fact which was shown\r\ntwo years ago, when many of the most bitter opponents of this measure\r\ncheerfully supported a similar and equally objectionable one in aid of\r\na Protestant institution. On the occasion referred to there were two\r\nassemblymen, both Celtic gentlemen, who were rivals for the leadership\r\nof the minority; one of them a stout, red-faced man, who may go by the\r\nname of the “Colonel,” owing to his having seen service in the army;\r\nwhile the other was a dapper, voluble fellow, who had at one time been\r\na civil justice and was called the “Judge.” Somebody was opposing the\r\ninsertion of the item on the ground (perfectly just, by the way)\r\nthat it was unconstitutional, and he dwelt upon this objection at\r\nsome length. The Judge, who knew nothing of the constitution, except\r\nthat it was continually being quoted against all of his favorite\r\nprojects, fidgeted about for some time, and at last jumped up to know\r\nif he might ask the gentleman a question. The latter said, “Yes,”\r\nand the Judge went on, “I’d like to know if the gintleman has ever\r\npersonally seen the Catholic Protectoree?” “No, I haven’t,” said his\r\nastonished opponent. “Then, phwat do you mane by talking about its\r\nbeing unconstitootional? It’s no more unconstitootional than you are!”\r\nThen, turning to the house, with slow and withering sarcasm, he added,\r\n“The throuble wid the gintleman is that he okkipies what lawyers would\r\ncall a kind of a quasi-position upon this bill,” and sat down amid the\r\napplause of his followers.\r\n\r\nHis rival, the Colonel, felt he had gained altogether too much glory\r\nfrom the encounter, and after the nonplussed countryman had taken\r\nhis seat, he stalked solemnly over to the desk of the elated Judge,\r\nlooked at him majestically for a moment, and said, “You’ll excuse\r\nmy mentioning, sorr, that the gintleman who has just sat down knows\r\nmore law in a wake than you do in a month; and more than that, Mike\r\nShaunnessy, phwat do you mane by quotin’ Latin on the flure of this\r\nHouse, _when you don’t know the alpha and omayga of the language_!” and\r\nback he walked, leaving the Judge in humiliated submission behind him.\r\n\r\nThe Judge was always falling foul of the Constitution. Once, when\r\ndefending one of his bills which made a small but wholly indefensible\r\nappropriation of State money for a private purpose, he asserted “that\r\nthe Constitution didn’t touch little things like that”; and on another\r\noccasion he remarked to me that he “never allowed the Constitution to\r\ncome between friends.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was at that time chairman of a committee, before\r\nwhich there sometimes came questions affecting the interests or\r\nsupposed interests of labor. The committee was hopelessly bad in\r\nits composition, most of the members being either very corrupt or\r\nexceedingly inefficient. The Colonel generally kept order with a good\r\ndeal of dignity; indeed, when, as not infrequently happened, he had\r\nlooked upon the rye that was flavored with lemon-peel, his sense of\r\npersonal dignity grew till it became fairly majestic, and he ruled the\r\ncommittee with a rod of iron. At one time a bill had been introduced\r\n(one of the several score of preposterous measures that annually make\r\ntheir appearance purely for purposes of buncombe), by whose terms all\r\nlaborers in the public works of great cities were to receive three\r\ndollars a day--double the market price of labor. To this bill, by\r\nthe way, an amendment was afterwards offered in the house by some\r\ngentleman with a sense of humor, which was to make it read that all\r\nthe inhabitants of great cities were to receive three dollars a day,\r\nand the privilege of laboring on the public works if they chose; the\r\noriginal author of the bill questioning doubtfully if the amendment\r\n“didn’t make the measure too sweeping.” The measure was, of course,\r\nof no consequence whatever to the genuine laboring men, but was of\r\ninterest to the professional labor agitators; and a body of the latter\r\nrequested leave to appear before the committee. This was granted, but\r\non the appointed day the chairman turned up in a condition of such\r\nportentous dignity as to make it evident that he had been on a spree\r\nof protracted duration. Down he sat at the head of the table, and\r\nglared at the committeemen, while the latter, whose faces would not\r\nhave looked amiss in a rogues’ gallery, cowered before him. The first\r\nspeaker was a typical professional laboring man; a sleek, oily little\r\nfellow, with a black mustache, who had never done a stroke of work\r\nin his life. He felt confident that the Colonel would favor him,--a\r\nconfidence soon to be rudely shaken,--and began with a deprecatory\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n“Humble though I am----”\r\n\r\nRap, rap, went the chairman’s gavel, and the following dialogue\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n_Chairman_ (with dignity). “What’s that you said you were, sir?”\r\n\r\n_Professional Workingman_ (decidedly taken aback). “I--I said I was\r\nhumble, sir?”\r\n\r\n_Chairman_ (reproachfully). “Are you an American citizen, sir?”\r\n\r\n_P. W._ “Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n_Chairman_ (with emphasis). “Then you’re the equal of any man in this\r\nState! Then you’re the equal of any man on this committee! _Don’t let\r\nme hear you call yourself humble again! Go on sir!_”\r\n\r\nAfter this warning the advocate managed to keep clear of the rocks\r\nuntil, having worked himself up to quite a pitch of excitement, he\r\nincautiously exclaimed, “But the poor man has no friends!” which\r\nbrought the Colonel down on him at once. Rap, rap, went his gavel,\r\nand he scowled grimly at the offender while he asked with deadly\r\ndeliberation:\r\n\r\n“What did you say that time, sir?”\r\n\r\n_P. W._ (hopelessly). “I said the poor man had no friends, sir.”\r\n\r\n_Chairman_ (with sudden fire). “Then you lied, sir! I am the poor man’s\r\nfriend! so are my colleagues, sir!” (Here the rogues’ gallery tried to\r\nlook benevolent.) “Speak the truth, sir!” (with sudden change from the\r\nmanner admonitory to the manner mandatory). “Now, you sit down quick,\r\nor get out of this somehow!”\r\n\r\nThis put an end to the sleek gentleman, and his place was taken by a\r\nfellow-professional of another type--a great, burly man, who would talk\r\nto you on private matters in a perfectly natural tone of voice, but\r\nwho, the minute he began to speak of the Wrongs (with a capital W) of\r\nLabor (with a capital L), bellowed as if he had been a bull of Bashan.\r\nThe Colonel, by this time pretty far gone, eyed him malevolently,\r\nswaying to and fro in his chair. However, the first effect of the\r\nfellow’s oratory was soothing rather than otherwise, and produced the\r\nunexpected result of sending the chairman fast asleep sitting bolt\r\nupright. But in a minute or two, as the man warmed up to his work, he\r\ngave a peculiarly resonant howl which waked the Colonel up. The latter\r\ncame to himself with a jerk, looked fixedly at the audience, caught\r\nsight of the speaker, remembered having seen him before, forgot that he\r\nhad been asleep, and concluded that it must have been on some previous\r\nday. Hammer, hammer, went the gavel, and--\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen you before, sir!”\r\n\r\n“You have not,” said the man.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me I lie, sir!” responded the Colonel, with sudden\r\nferocity. “You’ve addressed this committee on a previous day!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never--” began the man; but the Colonel broke in again:\r\n\r\n“Sit down, sir! The dignity of the chair must be preserved! No man\r\nshall speak to this committee twice. The committee stands adjourned.”\r\nAnd with that he stalked majestically out of the room, leaving the\r\ncommittee and the delegation to gaze sheepishly into each other’s faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OUTSIDERS.\r\n\r\nAfter all, outsiders furnish quite as much fun as the legislators\r\nthemselves. The number of men who persist in writing one letters of\r\npraise, abuse, and advice on every conceivable subject is appalling;\r\nand the writers are of every grade, from the lunatic and the criminal\r\nup. The most difficult to deal with are the men with hobbies. There is\r\nthe Protestant fool, who thinks that our liberties are menaced by the\r\nmachinations of the Church of Rome; and his companion idiot, who wants\r\nlegislation against all secret societies, especially the Masons. Then\r\nthere are the believers in “isms,” of whom the women-suffragists stand\r\nin the first rank. Now I have always been a believer in woman’s rights,\r\nbut I must confess I have never seen such a hopelessly impracticable\r\nset of persons as the woman-suffragists who came up to Albany to get\r\nlegislation. They simply would not draw up their measures in proper\r\nform; when I pointed out to one of them that their proposed bill\r\nwas drawn up in direct defiance of certain of the sections of the\r\nConstitution of the State he blandly replied that he did not care at\r\nall for that, because the measure had been drawn up so as to be in\r\naccord with the Constitution of Heaven. There was no answer to this\r\nbeyond the very obvious one that Albany was in no way akin to Heaven.\r\nThe ultra-temperance people--not the moderate and sensible ones--are\r\nquite as impervious to common sense.\r\n\r\nA member’s correspondence is sometimes amusing. A member receives\r\nshoals of letters of advice, congratulation, entreaty, and abuse, half\r\nof them anonymous. Most of these are stupid; but some are at least out\r\nof the common.\r\n\r\nI had some constant correspondents. One lady in the western part\r\nof the State wrote me a weekly disquisition on woman’s rights. A\r\nBuffalo clergyman spent two years on a one-sided correspondence about\r\nprohibition. A gentleman of Syracuse wrote me such a stream of essays\r\nand requests about the charter of that city that I feared he would\r\ndrive me into a lunatic asylum; but he anticipated matters by going\r\ninto one himself. A New Yorker at regular intervals sent up a request\r\nthat I would “reintroduce” the Dongan charter, which had lapsed two\r\ncenturies before. A gentleman interested in a proposed law to protect\r\nprimaries took to telegraphing daily questions as to its progress--a\r\nhabit of which I broke him by sending in response telegrams of several\r\nhundred words each, which I was careful not to prepay.\r\n\r\nThere are certain legislative actions which must be taken in a purely\r\nPickwickian sense. Notable among these are the resolutions of sympathy\r\nfor the alleged oppressed patriots and peoples of Europe. These are\r\ngenerally directed against England, as there exists in the lower\r\nstrata of political life an Anglophobia quite as objectionable as the\r\nAnglomania of the higher social circles.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these resolutions are to be classed as simply\r\n_bouffe_ affairs; they are commonly introduced by some ambitious\r\nlegislator--often, I regret to say, a native American--who has a\r\nlarge foreign vote in his district. During my term of service in\r\nthe Legislature, resolutions were introduced demanding the recall\r\nof Minister Lowell, assailing the Czar for his conduct towards the\r\nRussian Jews, sympathizing with the Land League and the Dutch Boers,\r\netc., etc.; the passage of each of which we strenuously and usually\r\nsuccessfully opposed, on the ground that while we would warmly\r\nwelcome any foreigner who came here, and in good faith assumed the\r\nduties of American citizenship, we had a right to demand in return\r\nthat he should not bring any of his race or national antipathies into\r\nAmerican political life. Resolutions of this character are sometimes\r\nundoubtedly proper; but in nine cases out of ten they are wholly\r\nunjustifiable. An instance of this sort of thing which took place not\r\nat Albany may be cited. Recently the Board of Aldermen of one of our\r\ngreat cities received a stinging rebuke, which it is to be feared the\r\naldermanic intellect was too dense fully to appreciate. The aldermen\r\npassed a resolution “condemning” the Czar of Russia for his conduct\r\ntowards his fellow-citizens of Hebrew faith, and “demanding” that he\r\nshould forthwith treat them better; this was forwarded to the Russian\r\nMinister, with a request that it be sent to the Czar. It came back\r\nforty-eight hours afterwards, with a note on the back by one of the\r\nunder-secretaries of the legation, to the effect that as he was not\r\naware that Russia had any diplomatic relations with this particular\r\nBoard of Aldermen, and as, indeed, Russia was not officially cognizant\r\nof their existence, and, moreover, was wholly indifferent to their\r\nopinions on any conceivable subject, he herewith returned them their\r\nkind communication.[7]\r\n\r\nIn concluding I would say, that while there is so much evil at Albany,\r\nand so much reason for our exerting ourselves to bring about a better\r\nstate of things, yet there is no cause for being disheartened or for\r\nthinking that it is hopeless to expect improvement. On the contrary,\r\nthe standard of legislative morals is certainly higher than it was\r\nfifteen years ago or twenty-five years ago. In the future it may\r\neither improve or retrograde, by fits and starts, for it will keep\r\npace exactly with the awakening of the popular mind to the necessity\r\nof having honest and intelligent representatives in the State\r\nLegislature.[8]\r\n\r\nI have had opportunity of knowing something about the workings of but a\r\nfew of our other State legislatures: from what I have seen and heard,\r\nI should say that we stand about on a par with those of Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, and Illinois, above that of Louisiana, and below those of\r\nVermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wyoming, as well as below\r\nthe national legislature at Washington. But the moral status of a\r\nlegislative body, especially in the West, often varies widely from year\r\nto year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] The _Century_, January, 1885.\r\n\r\n[7] A few years later a member of the Italian Legation “scored” heavily\r\non one of our least pleasant national peculiarities. An Italian had\r\njust been lynched in Colorado, and an Italian paper in New York\r\nbitterly denounced the Italian Minister for his supposed apathy in\r\nthe matter. The member of the Legation in question answered that the\r\naccusations were most unjust, for the Minister had worked zealously\r\nuntil he found that the deceased “had taken out his naturalization\r\npapers, and was entitled to all the privileges of American citizenship.”\r\n\r\n[8] At present, twelve years later, I should say that there was rather\r\nless personal corruption in the Legislature; but also less independence\r\nand greater subservience to the machine, which is even less responsive\r\nto honest and enlightened public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n                 MACHINE POLITICS IN NEW YORK CITY[9]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn New York city, as in most of our other great municipalities, the\r\ndirection of political affairs has been for many years mainly in the\r\nhands of a class of men who make politics their regular business\r\nand means of livelihood. These men are able to keep their grip only\r\nby means of the singularly perfect way in which they have succeeded\r\nin organizing their respective parties and factions; and it is in\r\nconsequence of the clock-work regularity and efficiency with which\r\nthese several organizations play their parts, alike for good and for\r\nevil, that they have been nicknamed by outsiders “machines,” while the\r\nmen who take part in and control, or, as they would themselves say,\r\n“run” them, now form a well-recognized and fairly well-defined class\r\nin the community, and are familiarly known as machine politicians. It\r\nmay be of interest to sketch in outline some of the characteristics of\r\nthese men and of their machines, the methods by which and the objects\r\nfor which they work, and the reasons for their success in the political\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe terms machine and machine politician are now undoubtedly used\r\nordinarily in a reproachful sense; but it does not at all follow that\r\nthis sense is always the right one. On the contrary, the machine is\r\noften a very powerful instrument for good; and a machine politician\r\nreally desirous of doing honest work on behalf of the community,\r\nis fifty times as useful an ally as is the average philanthropic\r\noutsider. Indeed, it is of course true, that any political organization\r\n(and absolutely no good work can be done in politics without an\r\norganization) is a machine; and any man who perfects and uses this\r\norganization is himself, to a certain extent, a machine politician.\r\nIn the rough, however, the feeling against machine politics and\r\npoliticians is tolerably well justified by the facts, although this\r\nstatement really reflects most severely upon the educated and honest\r\npeople who largely hold themselves aloof from public life, and show a\r\ncurious incapacity for fulfilling their public duties.\r\n\r\nThe organizations that are commonly and distinctively known as machines\r\nare those belonging to the two great recognized parties, or to their\r\nfactional subdivisions; and the reason why the word machine has come to\r\nbe used, to a certain extent, as a term of opprobrium is to be found\r\nin the fact that these organizations are now run by the leaders very\r\nlargely as business concerns to benefit themselves and their followers,\r\nwith little regard to the community at large. This is natural enough.\r\nThe men having control and doing all the work have gradually come to\r\nhave the same feeling about politics that other men have about the\r\nbusiness of a merchant or manufacturer; it was too much to expect that\r\nif left entirely to themselves they would continue disinterestedly to\r\nwork for the benefit of others. Many a machine politician who is to-day\r\na most unwholesome influence in our politics is in private life quite\r\nas respectable as anyone else; only he has forgotten that his business\r\naffects the state at large, and, regarding it as merely his own private\r\nconcern, he has carried into it the same selfish spirit that actuates\r\nin business matters the majority of the average mercantile community.\r\nA merchant or manufacturer works his business, as a rule, purely for\r\nhis own benefit, without any regard whatever for the community at\r\nlarge. The merchant uses all his influence for a low tariff, and the\r\nmanufacturer is even more strenuously in favor of protection, not at\r\nall from any theory of abstract right, but because of self-interest.\r\nEach views such a political question as the tariff, not from the\r\nstandpoint of how it will affect the nation as a whole, but merely\r\nfrom that of how it will affect him personally. If a community were in\r\nfavor of protection, but nevertheless permitted all the governmental\r\nmachinery to fall into the hands of importing merchants, it would\r\nbe small cause for wonder if the latter shaped the laws to suit\r\nthemselves, and the chief blame, after all, would rest with the supine\r\nand lethargic majority which failed to have enough energy to take\r\ncharge of their own affairs. Our machine politicians, in actual life\r\nact in just this same way; their actions are very often dictated by\r\nselfish motives, with but little regard for the people at large though,\r\nlike the merchants, they often hold a very high standard of honor on\r\ncertain points; they therefore need continually to be watched and\r\nopposed by those who wish to see good government. But, after all, it is\r\nhardly to be wondered at that they abuse power which is allowed to fall\r\ninto their hands owing to the ignorance or timid indifference of those\r\nwho by rights should themselves keep it.\r\n\r\nIn a society properly constituted for true democratic government--in\r\na society such as that seen in many of our country towns, for\r\nexample--machine rule is impossible. But in New York, as well as\r\nin most of our other great cities, the conditions favor the growth\r\nof ring or boss rule. The chief causes thus operating against good\r\ngovernment are the moral and mental attitudes towards politics assumed\r\nby different sections of the voters. A large number of these are\r\nsimply densely ignorant, and, of course, such are apt to fall under\r\nthe influence of cunning leaders, and even if they do right, it is\r\nby hazard merely. The criminal class in a great city is always of\r\nsome size, while what may be called the potentially criminal class is\r\nstill larger. Then there is a great class of laboring men, mostly\r\nof foreign birth or parentage, who at present both expect too much\r\nfrom legislation and yet at the same time realize too little how\r\npowerfully though indirectly they are affected by a bad or corrupt\r\ngovernment. In many wards the overwhelming majority of the voters do\r\nnot realize that heavy taxes fall ultimately upon them, and actually\r\nview with perfect complacency burdens laid by their representatives\r\nupon the tax-payers, and, if anything, approve of a hostile attitude\r\ntowards the latter--having a vague feeling of animosity towards them\r\nas possessing more than their proper proportion of the world’s good\r\nthings, and sharing with most other human beings the capacity to bear\r\nwith philosophic equanimity ills merely affecting one’s neighbors. When\r\npowerfully roused on some financial, but still more on some sentimental\r\nquestion, this same laboring class will throw its enormous and usually\r\ndecisive weight into the scale which it believes inclines to the right;\r\nbut its members are often curiously and cynically indifferent to\r\ncharges of corruption against favorite heroes or demagogues, so long\r\nas these charges do not imply betrayal of their own real or fancied\r\ninterests. Thus an alderman or assemblyman representing certain wards\r\nmay make as much money as he pleases out of corporations without\r\nseriously jeopardizing his standing with his constituents; but if he\r\nonce, whether from honest or dishonest motives, stands by a corporation\r\nwhen the interests of the latter are supposed to conflict with those\r\nof “the people,” it is all up with him. These voters are, moreover,\r\nvery emotional; they value in a public man what we are accustomed\r\nto consider virtues only to be taken into account when estimating\r\nprivate character. Thus, if a man is open-handed and warm-hearted,\r\nthey consider it as a fair offset to his being a little bit shaky\r\nwhen it comes to applying the eighth commandment to affairs of state.\r\nI have more than once heard the statement, “He is very liberal to\r\nthe poor,” advanced as a perfectly satisfactory answer to the charge\r\nthat a certain public man was corrupt. Moreover, working men, whose\r\nlives are passed in one unceasing round of narrow and monotonous\r\ntoil, are not unnaturally inclined to pay heed to the demagogues and\r\nprofessional labor advocates who promise if elected to try to pass\r\nlaws to better their condition; they are hardly prepared to understand\r\nor approve the American doctrine of government, which is that the\r\nstate cannot ordinarily attempt to better the condition of a man or a\r\nset of men, but can merely see that no wrong is done him or them by\r\nanyone else, and that all alike have a fair chance in the struggle\r\nfor life--a struggle wherein, it may as well at once be freely though\r\nsadly acknowledged, very many are bound to fail, no matter how ideally\r\nperfect any given system of government may be.\r\n\r\nOf course it must be remembered that all these general statements are\r\nsubject to an immense number of individual exceptions; there are tens\r\nof thousands of men who work with their hands for their daily bread\r\nand yet put into actual practice that sublime virtue of disinterested\r\nadherence to the right, even when it seems likely merely to benefit\r\nothers, and those others better off than they themselves are; for they\r\nvote for honesty and cleanliness, in spite of great temptation to\r\ndo the opposite, and in spite of their not seeing how any immediate\r\nbenefit will result to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REASONS FOR THE NEGLECT OF PUBLIC DUTIES BY RESPECTABLE MEN IN EASY\r\n                            CIRCUMSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThis class is composed of the great bulk of the men who range from\r\nwell-to-do up to very rich; and of these the former generally and the\r\nlatter almost universally neglect their political duties, for the most\r\npart rather pluming themselves upon their good conduct if they so\r\nmuch as vote on election day. This largely comes from the tremendous\r\nwear and tension of life in our great cities. Moreover, the men of\r\nsmall means with us are usually men of domestic habits; and this very\r\ndevotion to home, which is one of their chief virtues, leads them to\r\nneglect their public duties. They work hard, as clerks, mechanics,\r\nsmall tradesmen, etc., all day long, and when they get home in the\r\nevening they dislike to go out. If they do go to a ward meeting, they\r\nfind themselves isolated, and strangers both to the men whom they meet\r\nand to the matter on which they have to act; for in the city a man is\r\nquite as sure to know next to nothing about his neighbors as in the\r\ncountry he is to be intimately acquainted with them. In the country\r\nthe people of a neighborhood, when they assemble in one of their\r\nlocal conventions, are already well acquainted, and therefore able to\r\nact together with effect; whereas in the city, even if the ordinary\r\ncitizens do come out, they are totally unacquainted with one another,\r\nand are as helplessly unable to oppose the disciplined ranks of the\r\nprofessional politicians as is the case with a mob of freshmen in\r\none of our colleges when in danger of being hazed by the sophomores.\r\nMoreover, the pressure of competition in city life is so keen that men\r\noften have as much as they can do to attend to their own affairs, and\r\nreally hardly have the leisure to look after those of the public. The\r\ngeneral tendency everywhere is toward the specialization of functions,\r\nand this holds good as well in politics as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe reputable private citizens of small means thus often neglect to\r\nattend to their public duties because to do so would perhaps interfere\r\nwith their private business. This is bad enough, but the case is\r\nworse with the really wealthy, who still more generally neglect\r\nthese same duties, partly because not to do so would interfere with\r\ntheir pleasure, and partly from a combination of other motives, all\r\nof them natural but none of them creditable. A successful merchant,\r\nwell dressed, pompous, self-important, unused to any life outside of\r\nthe counting-room, and accustomed because of his very success to be\r\ntreated with deferential regard, as one who stands above the common run\r\nof humanity, naturally finds it very unpleasant to go to a caucus or\r\nprimary where he has to stand on an equal footing with his groom and\r\nday-laborers, and indeed may discover that the latter, thanks to their\r\nfaculty for combination, are rated higher in the scale of political\r\nimportance than he is himself. In all the large cities of the North the\r\nwealthier, or, as they would prefer to style themselves, the “upper”\r\nclasses, tend distinctly towards the bourgeois type; and an individual\r\nin the bourgeois stage of development, while honest, industrious, and\r\nvirtuous, is also not unapt to be a miracle of timid and short-sighted\r\nselfishness. The commercial classes are only too likely to regard\r\neverything merely from the standpoint of “Does it pay?” and many a\r\nmerchant does not take any part in politics because he is short-sighted\r\nenough to think that it will pay him better to attend purely to making\r\nmoney, and too selfish to be willing to undergo any trouble for the\r\nsake of abstract duty; while the younger men of this type are too much\r\nengrossed in their various social pleasures to be willing to give\r\ntheir time to anything else. It is also unfortunately true, especially\r\nthroughout New England and the Middle States, that the general tendency\r\namong people of culture and high education has been to neglect and even\r\nto look down upon the rougher and manlier virtues, so that an advanced\r\nstate of intellectual development is too often associated with a\r\ncertain effeminacy of character. Our more intellectual men often shrink\r\nfrom the raw coarseness and the eager struggle of political life as if\r\nthey were women. Now, however refined and virtuous a man may be, he is\r\nyet entirely out of place in the American body-politic unless he is\r\nhimself of sufficiently coarse fibre and virile character to be more\r\nangered than hurt by an insult or injury; the timid good form a most\r\nuseless as well as a most despicable portion of the community. Again,\r\nwhen a man is heard objecting to taking part in politics because it is\r\n“low,” he may be set down as either a fool or a coward: it would be\r\nquite as sensible for a militiaman to advance the same statement as an\r\nexcuse for refusing to assist in quelling a riot. Many cultured men\r\nneglect their political duties simply because they are too delicate to\r\nhave the element of “strike back” in their natures, and because they\r\nhave an unmanly fear of being forced to stand up for their own rights\r\nwhen threatened with abuse or insult. Such are the conditions which\r\ngive the machine men their chance; and they have been able to make the\r\nmost possible out of this chance,--first, because of the perfection to\r\nwhich they have brought their machinery, and, second, because of the\r\nsocial character of their political organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ORGANIZATION AND WORK OF THE MACHINES.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of any one of our political bodies is always rather\r\ncomplicated; and its politicians invariably endeavor to keep it so,\r\nbecause, their time being wholly given to it, they are able to become\r\nperfectly familiar with all its workings, while the average outsider\r\nbecomes more and more helpless in proportion as the organization is\r\nless and less simple. Besides some others of minor importance, there\r\nare at present in New York three great political organizations, _viz._,\r\nthose of the regular Republicans, of the County Democracy,[10] and of\r\nTammany Hall, that of the last being perhaps the most perfect, viewed\r\nfrom a machine standpoint. Although with wide differences in detail,\r\nall these bodies are organized upon much the same general plan; and\r\none description may be taken in the rough, as applying to all. There\r\nis a large central committee, composed of numerous delegates from the\r\ndifferent assembly districts, which decides upon the various questions\r\naffecting the party as a whole in the county and city; and then there\r\nare the various organizations in the assembly districts themselves,\r\nwhich are the real sources of strength, and with which alone it is\r\nnecessary to deal. There are different rules for the admission to the\r\nvarious district primaries and caucuses of the voters belonging to the\r\nrespective parties; but in almost every case the real work is done and\r\nthe real power held by a small knot of men, who in turn pay a greater\r\nor less degree of fealty to a single boss.\r\n\r\nThe mere work to be done on election day and in preparing for it\r\nforms no slight task. There is an association in each assembly or\r\nelection district, with its president, secretary, treasurer, executive\r\ncommittee, etc.; these call the primaries and caucuses, arrange the\r\nlists of the delegates to the various nominating conventions, raise\r\nfunds for campaign purposes, and hold themselves in communication\r\nwith their central party organizations. At the primaries in each\r\nassembly district a full set of delegates is chosen to nominate\r\nassemblymen and aldermen, while others are chosen to go to the\r\nState, county, and congressional conventions. Before election day\r\nmany thousands of complete sets of the party ticket are printed,\r\nfolded, and put together, or, as it is called, “bunched.” A single\r\nbundle of these ballots is then sent to every voter in the district,\r\nwhile thousands are reserved for distribution at the polls. In every\r\nelection precinct--there are probably twenty or thirty in each\r\nassembly district--a captain and from two to a dozen subordinates\r\nare appointed.[11] These have charge of the actual giving out of the\r\nballots at the polls. On election day they are at their places long\r\nbefore the hour set for voting; each party has a wooden booth, looking\r\na good deal like a sentry-box, covered over with flaming posters\r\ncontaining the names of their nominees, and the “workers” cluster\r\naround these as centres. Every voter as he approaches is certain to be\r\noffered a set of tickets; usually these sets are “straight,” that is,\r\ncontain all the nominees of one party, but frequently crooked work will\r\nbe done, and some one candidate will get his own ballots bunched with\r\nthe rest of those of the opposite party. Each captain of a district\r\nis generally paid a certain sum of money, greater or less according to\r\nhis ability as a politician or according to his power of serving the\r\nboss or machine. Nominally this money goes in paying the subordinates\r\nand in what are vaguely termed “campaign expenses,” but as a matter of\r\nfact it is in many instances simply pocketed by the recipient; indeed,\r\nvery little of the large sums of money annually spent by candidates to\r\nbribe voters actually reaches the voters supposed to be bribed. The\r\nmoney thus furnished is procured either by subscriptions from rich\r\noutsiders, or by assessments upon the candidates themselves; formerly\r\nmuch was also obtained from office-holders, but this is now prohibited\r\nby law. A great deal of money is also spent in advertising, placarding\r\nposters, paying for public meetings, and organizing and uniforming\r\nmembers to take part in some huge torchlight procession--this last\r\nparticular form of spectacular enjoyment being one peculiarly dear to\r\nthe average American political mind. Candidates for very lucrative\r\npositions are often assessed really huge sums, in order to pay for\r\nthe extravagant methods by which our canvasses are conducted. Before\r\na legislative committee of which I was a member, the Register of New\r\nYork County blandly testified under oath that he had forgotten whether\r\nhis expenses during his canvass had been over or under fifty thousand\r\ndollars. It must be remembered that even now--and until recently\r\nthe evil was very much greater--the rewards paid to certain public\r\nofficials are out of all proportion to the services rendered; and in\r\nsuch cases the active managing politicians feel that they have a right\r\nto exact the heaviest possible toll from the candidate, to help pay\r\nthe army of hungry heelers who do their bidding. Thus, before the same\r\ncommittee the County Clerk testified that his income was very nearly\r\neighty thousand a year, but with refreshing frankness admitted that his\r\nown position was practically merely that of a figure-head, and that all\r\nthe work was done by his deputy, on a small fixed salary. As the County\r\nClerk’s term is three years, he should nominally have received nearly\r\na quarter of a million dollars; but as a matter of fact two thirds of\r\nthe money probably went to the political organizations with which he\r\nwas connected. The enormous emoluments of such officers are, of course,\r\nmost effective in debauching politics. They bear no relation whatever\r\nto the trifling quantity of work done, and the chosen candidate readily\r\nrecognizes what is the exact truth,--namely, that the benefit of his\r\nservice is expected to enure to his party allies, and not to the\r\ncitizens at large. Thus, one of the county officers who came before\r\nthe above-mentioned committee, testified with a naïve openness which\r\nwas appalling, in answer to what was believed to be a purely formal\r\nquestion as to whether he performed his public duties faithfully,\r\nthat he did so perform them whenever they did not conflict with his\r\npolitical duties!--meaning thereby, as he explained, attending to his\r\nlocal organizations, seeing politicians, fixing primaries, bailing\r\nout those of his friends (apparently by no means few in number) who\r\ngot hauled up before a justice of the peace, etc., etc. This man’s\r\nstatements were valuable because, being a truthful person and of such\r\ndense ignorance that he was at first wholly unaware his testimony was\r\nin any way remarkable, he really tried to tell things as they were;\r\nand it had evidently never occurred to him that he was not expected by\r\neveryone to do just as he had been doing,--that is, to draw a large\r\nsalary for himself, to turn over a still larger fund to his party\r\nallies, and conscientiously to endeavor, as far as he could, by the\r\nfree use of his time and influence, to satisfy the innumerable demands\r\nmade upon him by the various small-fry politicians.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              “HEELERS.”\r\n\r\nThe “heelers,” or “workers,” who stand at the polls, and are paid\r\nin the way above described, form a large part of the rank and file\r\ncomposing each organization. There are, of course, scores of them in\r\neach assembly district association, and, together with the almost\r\nequally numerous class of federal, State, or local paid office-holders\r\n(except in so far as these last have been cut out by the operations\r\nof the civil-service reform laws), they form the bulk of the men by\r\nwhom the machine is run, the bosses of great and small degree chiefly\r\nmerely oversee the work and supervise the deeds of their henchmen.\r\nThe organization of a party in our city is really much like that of\r\nan army. There is one great central boss, assisted by some trusted\r\nand able lieutenants; these communicate with the different district\r\nbosses, whom they alternately bully and assist. The district boss in\r\nturn has a number of half-subordinates, half-allies, under him; these\r\nlatter choose the captains of the election districts, etc., and come\r\ninto contact with the common heelers. The more stupid and ignorant\r\nthe common heelers are, and the more implicitly they obey orders, the\r\ngreater becomes the effectiveness of the machine. An ideal machine has\r\nfor its officers men of marked force, cunning and unscrupulous, and\r\nfor its common soldiers men who may be either corrupt or moderately\r\nhonest, but who must be of low intelligence. This is the reason why\r\nsuch a large proportion of the members of every political machine\r\nare recruited from the lower grades of the foreign population. These\r\nhenchmen obey unhesitatingly the orders of their chiefs, both at the\r\nprimary or caucus and on election day, receiving regular rewards for\r\nso doing, either in employment procured for them or else in money\r\noutright. Of course it is by no means true that these men are all\r\nactuated merely by mercenary motives. The great majority entertain also\r\na real feeling of allegiance towards the party to which they belong,\r\nor towards the political chief whose fortunes they follow; and many\r\nwork entirely without pay and purely for what they believe to be right.\r\nIndeed, an experienced politician always greatly prefers to have under\r\nhim men whose hearts are in their work and upon whose unbribed devotion\r\nhe can rely; but unfortunately he finds in most cases that their\r\nexertions have to be seconded by others which are prompted by motives\r\nfar more mixed.\r\n\r\nAll of these men, whether paid or not, make a business of political\r\nlife and are thoroughly at home among the obscure intrigues that go to\r\nmake up so much of it; and consequently they have quite as much the\r\nadvantage when pitted against amateurs as regular soldiers have when\r\nmatched against militiamen. But their numbers, though absolutely large,\r\nare, relatively to the entire community, so small that some other cause\r\nmust be taken into consideration in order to account for the commanding\r\nposition occupied by the machine and the machine politicians in public\r\nlife. This other determining cause is to be found in the fact that all\r\nthese machine associations have a social as well as a political side,\r\nand that a large part of the political life of every leader or boss is\r\nalso identical with his social life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE SOCIAL SIDE OF MACHINE POLITICS.\r\n\r\nThe political associations of the various districts are not organized\r\nmerely at the approach of election day; on the contrary, they exist\r\nthroughout the year, and for the greater part of the time are to a\r\ngreat extent merely social clubs. To a large number of the men who\r\nbelong to them they are the chief social rallying-point. These men\r\ncongregate in the association building in the evening to smoke,\r\ndrink beer, and play cards, precisely as the wealthier men gather in\r\nthe clubs whose purpose is avowedly social and not political--such\r\nas the Union, University, and Knickerbocker. Politics thus becomes a\r\npleasure and relaxation as well as a serious pursuit. The different\r\nmembers of the same club or association become closely allied with one\r\nanother, and able to act together on occasions with unison and _esprit\r\nde corps_; and they will stand by one of their own number for reasons\r\nprecisely homologous to those which make a member of one of the upper\r\nclubs support a fellow-member if the latter happens to run for office.\r\n“He is a gentleman, and shall have my vote,” says the swell club man.\r\n“He’s one of the boys, and I’m for him,” replies the heeler from the\r\ndistrict party association. In each case the feeling is social rather\r\nthan political, but where the club man influences one vote the heeler\r\ncontrols ten. A rich merchant and a small tradesman alike find it\r\nmerely a bore to attend the meetings of the local political club; it\r\nis to them an irksome duty which is shirked whenever possible. But\r\nto the small politicians and to the various workers and hangers-on,\r\nthese meetings have a distinct social attraction, and the attendance\r\nis a matter of preference. They are in congenial society and in the\r\nplace where by choice they spend their evenings, and where they bring\r\ntheir friends and associates; and naturally all the men so brought\r\ntogether gradually blend their social and political ties, and work\r\nwith an effectiveness impossible to the outside citizens whose social\r\ninstincts interfere, instead of coinciding with their political duties.\r\nIf an ordinary citizen wishes to have a game of cards or a talk with\r\nsome of his companions, he must keep away from the local headquarters\r\nof his party; whereas, under similar circumstances, the professional\r\npolitician must go there. The man who is fond of his home naturally\r\nprefers to stay there in the evenings, rather than go out among the\r\nnoisy club frequenters, whose pleasure it is to see each other at\r\nleast weekly, and who spend their evenings discussing neither sport,\r\nbusiness, nor scandal, as do other sections of the community, but the\r\nequally monotonous subject of ward politics.\r\n\r\nThe strength of our political organizations arises from their\r\ndevelopment as social bodies; many of the hardest workers in their\r\nranks are neither office-holders nor yet paid henchmen, but merely\r\nmembers who have gradually learned to identify their fortunes with\r\nthe party whose hall they have come to regard as the head-quarters in\r\nwhich to spend the most agreeable of their leisure moments. Under the\r\nAmerican system it is impossible for a man to accomplish anything by\r\nhimself; he must associate himself with others, and they must throw\r\ntheir weight together. This is just what the social functions of the\r\npolitical clubs enable their members to do. The great and rich society\r\nclubs are composed of men who are not apt to take much interest in\r\npolitics anyhow, and never act as a body. The great effect produced by\r\na social organization for political purposes is shown by the career\r\nof the Union League Club; and equally striking proof can be seen by\r\nevery man who attends a ward meeting. There is thus, however much to\r\nbe regretted it may be, a constant tendency towards the concentration\r\nof political power in the hands of those men who by taste and\r\neducation are fitted to enjoy the social side of the various political\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE LIQUOR-SELLER IN POLITICS.\r\n\r\nIt is this that gives the liquor-sellers their enormous influence in\r\npolitics. Preparatory to the general election of 1884, there were held\r\nin the various districts of New York ten hundred and seven primaries\r\nand political conventions of all parties, and of these no less than\r\nsix hundred and thirty-three took place in liquor-saloons,--a showing\r\nthat leaves small ground for wonder at the low average grade of the\r\nnominees. The reason for such a condition of things is perfectly\r\nevident: it is because the liquor-saloons are places of social resort\r\nfor the same men who turn the local political organizations into social\r\nclubs. Bar-tenders form perhaps the nearest approach to a leisure class\r\nthat we have at present on this side of the water. Naturally they are\r\non semi-intimate terms with all who frequent their houses. There is no\r\nplace where more gossip is talked than in bar-rooms, and much of this\r\ngossip is about politics,--that is, the politics of the ward, not of\r\nthe nation. The tariff and the silver question may be alluded to and\r\ncivil-service reform may be incidentally damned, but the real interest\r\ncomes in discussing the doings of the men with whom they are personally\r\nacquainted: why Billy so-and-so, the alderman, has quarrelled with his\r\nformer chief supporter; whether “old man X” has really managed to fix\r\nthe delegates to a given convention; the reason why one faction bolted\r\nat the last primary; and if it is true that a great down-town boss\r\nwho has an intimate friend of opposite political faith running in an\r\nup-town district has forced the managers of his own party to put up a\r\nman of straw against him. The bar-keeper is a man of much local power,\r\nand is, of course, hail-fellow-well-met with his visitors, as he and\r\nthey can be of mutual assistance to one another. Even if of different\r\npolitics, their feelings towards each other are influenced purely by\r\npersonal considerations; and, indeed, this is true of most of the\r\nsmaller bosses as regards their dealings among themselves, for, as one\r\nof them once remarked to me with enigmatic truthfulness, “there are\r\nno politics in politics” of the lower sort--which, being interpreted,\r\nmeans that a professional politician is much less apt to be swayed by\r\nthe fact of a man’s being a Democrat or a Republican than he is by his\r\nbeing a personal friend or foe. The liquor-saloons thus become the\r\nsocial head-quarters of the little knots or cliques of men who take\r\nmost interest in local political affairs; and by an easy transition\r\nthey become the political head-quarters when the time for preparing\r\nfor the elections arrives; and, of course, the good-will of the owners\r\nof the places is thereby propitiated,--an important point with men\r\nstriving to control every vote possible.\r\n\r\nThe local political clubs also become to a certain extent mutual\r\nbenefit associations. The men in them become pretty intimate with one\r\nanother; and in the event of one becoming ill, or from any other cause\r\nthrown out of employment, his fellow-members will very often combine to\r\nassist him through his troubles, and quite large sums are frequently\r\nraised for such a purpose. Of course, this forms an additional bond\r\namong the members, who become closely knit together by ties of\r\ncompanionship, self-interest, and mutual interdependence. Very many\r\nmembers of these associations come into them without any thought of\r\nadvancing their own fortunes; they work very hard for their party, or\r\nrather for the local body bearing the party name, but they do it quite\r\ndisinterestedly, and from a feeling akin to that which we often see\r\nmake other men devote their time and money to advancing the interests\r\nof a yacht club or racing stable, although no immediate benefit can\r\nresult therefrom to themselves. One such man I now call to mind who\r\nis by no means well off, and is neither an office-seeker nor an\r\noffice-holder, but who regularly every year spends about fifty dollars\r\nat election time for the success of the party, or rather the wing of\r\nthe party, to which he belongs. He has a personal pride in seeing his\r\npet candidates rolling up large majorities. Men of this stamp also\r\nnaturally feel most enthusiasm for, or animosity against, the minor\r\ncandidates with whom they are themselves acquainted. The names at\r\nthe head of the ticket do not, to their minds, stand out with much\r\nindividuality; and while such names usually command the normal party\r\nsupport, yet very often there is an infinitely keener rivalry among the\r\nsmaller politicians over candidates for local offices. I remember, in\r\n1880, a very ardent Democratic ward club, many of the members of which\r\nin the heat of a contest for an assemblyman cooly swapped off quite a\r\nnumber of votes for President in consideration of votes given to their\r\ncandidate for the State Legislature; and in 1885, in my own district, a\r\nlocal Republican club that had a member running for alderman, performed\r\na precisely similar feat in relation to their party’s candidate for\r\ngovernor. A Tammany State Senator openly announced in a public speech\r\nthat it was of vastly more importance to Tammany to have one of her own\r\nmen Mayor of New York than it was to have a Democratic President of the\r\nUnited States. Very many of the leaders of the rival organizations,\r\nwho lack the boldness to make such a frankly cynical avowal of what\r\ntheir party feeling really amounts to, yet in practice, both as regards\r\nmayor and as regards all other local offices which are politically or\r\npecuniarily of importance, act exactly on the theory enunciated by the\r\nTammany statesman; and, as a consequence, in every great election not\r\nonly is it necessary to have the mass of the voters waked up to the\r\nimportance of the principles that are at stake, but, unfortunately, it\r\nis also necessary to see that the powerful local leaders are convinced\r\nthat it will be to their own interest to be faithful to the party\r\nticket. Often there will be intense rivalry between two associations\r\nor two minor bosses; and one may take up and the other oppose the\r\ncause of a candidate with an earnestness and hearty good-will arising\r\nby no means from any feeling for the man himself, but from the desire\r\nto score a triumph over the opposition. It not unfrequently happens\r\nthat a perfectly good man, who would not knowingly suffer the least\r\nimpropriety in the conduct of his canvass, is supported in some one\r\ndistrict by a little knot of politicians of shady character, who have\r\nnothing in common with him at all, but who wish to beat a rival body\r\nthat is opposing him, and who do not for a moment hesitate to use\r\nevery device, from bribery down, to accomplish their ends. A curious\r\nincident of this sort came to my knowledge while happening to inquire\r\nhow a certain man became a Republican. It occurred a good many years\r\nago, and thanks to our election laws it could not now be repeated in\r\nall its details; but affairs similar in kind occur at every election. I\r\nmay preface it by stating that the man referred to, whom we will call\r\nX, ended by pushing himself up in the world, thanks to his own industry\r\nand integrity, and is now a well-to-do private citizen and as good a\r\nfellow as anyone would wish to see. But at the time spoken of he was\r\na young laborer, of Irish birth, working for his livelihood on the\r\ndocks and associating with his Irish and American fellows. The district\r\nwhere he lived was overwhelmingly Democratic, and the contests were\r\ngenerally merely factional. One small politician, a saloonkeeper named\r\nLarry, who had a great deal of influence, used to enlist on election\r\nday, by pay and other compensation, the services of the gang of young\r\nfellows to which X belonged. On one occasion he failed to reward them\r\nfor their work, and in other ways treated them so shabbily as to make\r\nthem very angry, more especially X, who was their leader. There was\r\nno way to pay Larry off until the next election; but they determined\r\nto break his influence utterly then, and as the best method for doing\r\nthis they decided to “vote as far away from him” as possible, or,\r\nin other words, to strain every nerve to secure the election of all\r\nthe candidates most opposed to those whom Larry favored. After due\r\nconsultation, it was thought that this could be most surely done by\r\nsupporting the Republican ticket. Most of the other bodies of young\r\nlaborers, or, indeed, of young roughs, made common cause with X and his\r\nfriends. Everything was kept very quiet until election day, neither\r\nLarry nor the few Republicans having an inkling of what was going on.\r\nIt was a rough district, and usually the Republican booths were broken\r\nup and their ballot-distributers driven off early in the day; but on\r\nthis occasion, to the speechless astonishment of everybody, things\r\nwent just the other way. The Republican ballots were distributed most\r\nactively, the opposing workers were bribed, persuaded, or frightened\r\naway, all means fair and foul were tried, and finally there was almost\r\na riot,--the outcome being that the Republicans actually obtained a\r\nmajority in a district where they had never before polled ten per cent.\r\nof the total vote. Such a phenomenon attracted the attention of the big\r\nRepublican leaders, who after some inquiry found it was due to X. To\r\nshow their gratitude and to secure so useful an ally permanently (for\r\nthis was before the days of civil-service reform), they procured him\r\na lucrative place in the New York Post-office; and he, in turn, being\r\na man of natural parts, at once seized the opportunity, set to work\r\nto correct the defects of his early education, and is now what I have\r\ndescribed him to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BOSS METHODS.\r\n\r\nA politician who becomes an influential local leader or boss is, of\r\ncourse, always one with a genuine talent for intrigue and organization.\r\nHe owes much of his power to the rewards he is able to dispense. Not\r\nonly does he procure for his supporters positions in the service of the\r\nState or city,--as in the custom-house, sheriff’s office, etc.,--but\r\nhe is also able to procure positions for many on horse railroads, the\r\nelevated roads, quarry works, etc. Great corporations are peculiarly\r\nsubject to the attacks of demagogues, and they find it much to their\r\ninterest to be on good terms with the leader in each district who\r\ncontrols the vote of the Assemblyman and Alderman; and therefore\r\nthe former is pretty sure that a letter of recommendation from him\r\non behalf of any applicant for work will receive most favorable\r\nconsideration. The leader is also continually helping his henchmen out\r\nof difficulties, pecuniary and otherwise; he lends them a dollar or two\r\nnow and then, helps out, when possible, such of their kinsmen as get\r\ninto the clutches of the law, gets a hold over such of them as have\r\ndone wrong and are afraid of being exposed, and learns to mix judicious\r\nbullying with the rendering of service.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to all this, the boss owes very much of his commanding\r\ninfluence to his social relations with various bodies of his\r\nconstituents; and it is his work as well as his pleasure to keep up\r\nthese relations. No _débutante_ during her first winter in society has\r\na more exacting round of social duties to perform than has a prominent\r\nward politician. In every ward there are numerous organizations,\r\nprimarily social in character, but capable of being turned to good\r\naccount politically. The Amalgamated Hack-drivers’ Union, the Hibernian\r\nRepublican Club, the West Side Young Democrats, the Jefferson C. Mullin\r\nPicnic Association,--there are twenty such bodies as these in every\r\ndistrict, and with, at any rate, the master spirits in each and all it\r\nis necessary for the boss to keep on terms of intimate and, indeed,\r\nrather boisterous friendship. When the Jefferson C. Mullin society goes\r\non a picnic, the average citizen scrupulously avoids its neighborhood;\r\nbut the boss goes, perhaps with his wife, and, moreover, enjoys himself\r\nheartily, and is hail-fellow-well-met with the rest of the picnickers,\r\nwho, by the way, may be by no means bad fellows; and when election\r\nday comes round, the latter, in return, no matter to what party\r\nthey may nominally belong, enthusiastically support their friend and\r\nguest, on social, not political, grounds. The boss knows every man\r\nin his district who can control any number of votes: an influential\r\nsaloon-keeper, the owner of a large livery stable, the leader among\r\na set of horse-car drivers, a foreman in a machine-shop who has a\r\ntaste for politics,--with all alike he keeps up constant and friendly\r\nrelations. Of course this fact does not of itself make the boss a bad\r\nman; there are several such I could point out who are ten times over\r\nbetter fellows than are the mild-mannered scholars of timorous virtue\r\nwho criticise them. But on the whole the qualities tending to make a\r\nman a successful local political leader under our present conditions\r\nare not apt to be qualities that make him serve the public honestly or\r\ndisinterestedly; and in the lower wards, where there is a large vicious\r\npopulation, the condition of politics is often fairly appalling,\r\nand the boss of the dominant party is generally a man of grossly\r\nimmoral public and private character, as anyone can satisfy himself\r\nby examining the testimony taken by the last two or three legislative\r\ncommittees that have investigated the affairs of New York city. In some\r\nof these wards many of the social organizations with which the leaders\r\nare obliged to keep on good terms are composed of criminals, or of the\r\nrelatives and associates of criminals. The testimony mentioned above\r\nshowed some strange things. I will take at random a few instances that\r\noccur to me at the moment. There was one case of an assemblyman who\r\nserved several terms in the Legislature, while his private business was\r\nto carry on corrupt negotiations between the Excise Commissioners and\r\nowners of low haunts who wished licenses. The president of a powerful\r\nsemi-political association was by profession a burglar; the man who\r\nreceived the goods he stole was an alderman. Another alderman was\r\nelected while his hair was still short from a term in State Prison.\r\nA school trustee had been convicted of embezzlement, and was the\r\nassociate of criminals. A prominent official in the Police Department\r\nwas interested in disreputable houses and gambling saloons, and was\r\nbacked politically by their proprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BEATING THE MACHINE.\r\n\r\nIn the better wards the difficulty comes in drilling a little sense\r\nand energy into decent people: they either do not care to combine\r\nor else refuse to learn how. In one district we did at one time and\r\nfor a considerable period get control of affairs and elect a set of\r\nalmost ideal delegates and candidates to the various nominating and\r\nlegislative bodies, and in the end took an absolutely commanding\r\nalthough temporary position in State and even in national politics.\r\n\r\nThis was done by the efforts of some twenty or thirty young fellows who\r\ndevoted a large part of their time to thoroughly organizing and getting\r\nout the respectable vote. The moving spirits were all active, energetic\r\nmen, with common sense, whose motives were perfectly disinterested.\r\nSome went in from principle; others, doubtless, from good-fellowship\r\nor sheer love of the excitement always attendant upon a political\r\nstruggle. Our success was due to our absolute freedom from caste\r\nspirit. Among our chief workers were a Columbia College professor, a\r\ncrack oarsman from the same institution, an Irish quarryman, a master\r\ncarpenter, a rich young merchant, the owner of a small cigar store, the\r\neditor of a little German newspaper, and a couple of employees from\r\nthe post-office and custom-house, who worked directly against their\r\nown seeming interests. One of our important committees was composed\r\nof a prominent member of a Jewish synagogue, of the son of a noted\r\nPresbyterian clergyman, and of a young Catholic lawyer. We won some\r\nquite remarkable triumphs, for the first time in New York politics\r\ncarrying primaries against the machine, and as the result of our most\r\nsuccessful struggle completely revolutionizing the State Convention\r\nheld to send delegates to the National Republican Convention of 1884,\r\nand returning to that body, for the first and only time it was ever\r\ndone, a solid delegation of Independent Republicans. This was done,\r\nhowever, by sheer hard work on the part of a score or so of men; the\r\nmass of our good citizens, even after the victories which they had\r\nassisted in winning, understood nothing about how they were won. Many\r\nof them actually objected to organizing, apparently having a confused\r\nidea that we could always win by what one of their number called a\r\n“spontaneous uprising,” to which a quiet young fellow in our camp\r\ngrimly responded that he had done a good deal of political work in his\r\nday, but that he never in his life had worked so hard and so long as he\r\ndid to get up the “spontaneous” movement in which we were then engaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be accepted as a fact, however unpleasant, that\r\nif steady work and much attention to detail are required, ordinary\r\ncitizens, to whom participation in politics is merely a disagreeable\r\nduty, will always be beaten by the organized army of politicians to\r\nwhom it is both duty, business, and pleasure, and who are knit together\r\nand to outsiders by their social relations. On the other hand, average\r\ncitizens do take a spasmodic interest in public affairs; and we should\r\ntherefore so shape our governmental system that the action required by\r\nthe voters should be as simple and direct as possible, and should not\r\nneed to be taken any more often than is necessary. Governmental power\r\nshould be concentrated in the hands of a very few men, who would be so\r\nconspicuous that no citizen could help knowing all about them; and the\r\nelections should not come too frequently. Not one decent voter in ten\r\nwill take the trouble annually to inform himself as to the character\r\nof the host of petty candidates to be balloted for, but he will be\r\nsure to know all about the mayor, comptroller, etc. It is not to his\r\ncredit that we can only rely, and that without much certainty, upon his\r\ntaking a spasmodic interest in the government that affects his own\r\nwell-being; but such is the case, and accordingly we ought, as far as\r\npossible, to have a system requiring on his part intermittent and not\r\nsustained action.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] The _Century_, November, 1886.\r\n\r\n[10] Since succeeded every year or two by some other anti-Tammany\r\nDemocratic organization or organizations.\r\n\r\n[11] All this has been changed, vastly for the better, by the ballot\r\nreform laws, under which the State distributes the printed ballots; and\r\nelections are now much more honest than formerly.\r\n\r\n[12] As a consequence of our investigation the committee, of which\r\nI was chairman, succeeded in securing the enactment of laws which\r\nabolished these enormous salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                 SIX YEARS OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORM[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo question of internal administration is so important to the United\r\nStates as the question of Civil Service reform, because the spoils\r\nsystem, which can only be supplanted through the agencies which have\r\nfound expression in the act creating the Civil Service Commission,\r\nhas been for seventy years the most potent of all the forces tending\r\nto bring about the degradation of our politics. No republic can\r\npermanently endure when its politics are corrupt and base; and the\r\nspoils system, the application in political life of the degrading\r\ndoctrine that to the victor belong the spoils, produces corruption and\r\ndegradation. The man who is in politics for the offices might just as\r\nwell be in politics for the money he can get for his vote, so far as\r\nthe general good is concerned. When the then Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States, Mr. Hendricks, said that he “wished to take the boys\r\nin out of the cold to warm their toes,” thereby meaning that he wished\r\nto distribute offices among the more active heelers, to the rapturous\r\nenthusiasm of the latter, he uttered a sentiment which was morally\r\non the same plane with a wish to give “the boys” five dollars apiece\r\nall around for their votes, and fifty dollars apiece when they showed\r\nthemselves sufficiently active in bullying, bribing, and cajoling other\r\nvoters. Such a sentiment should bar any man from public life, and will\r\nbar him whenever the people grow to realize that the worst enemies of\r\nthe Republic are the demagogue and the corruptionist. The spoils-monger\r\nand spoils-seeker invariably breed the bribe-taker and bribe-giver,\r\nthe embezzler of public funds and the corrupter of voters. Civil\r\nService reform is not merely a movement to better the public service.\r\nIt achieves this end too; but its main purpose is to raise the tone of\r\npublic life, and it is in this direction that its effects have been of\r\nincalculable good to the whole community.\r\n\r\nFor six years, from May, 1889, to May, 1895, I was a member of the\r\nNational Civil Service Commission, and it seems to me to be of\r\ninterest to show exactly what has been done to advance the law and\r\nwhat to hinder its advancement during these six years, and who have\r\nbeen the more prominent among its friends and foes. I wish to tell\r\n“the adventures of Philip on his way through the world,” and show who\r\nrobbed him, who helped him, and who passed him by. It would take too\r\nlong to give the names of all our friends, and it is not worth while\r\nto more than allude to most of our foes and to most of those who were\r\nindifferent to us; but a few of the names should be preserved and some\r\nrecord made of the fights that have been fought and won and of the way\r\nin which, by fits and starts, and with more than one set-back, the\r\ngeneral advance has been made.\r\n\r\nOf the Commission itself little need be said. When I took office\r\nthe only Commissioner was Mr. Charles Lyman, of Connecticut, who\r\nresigned when I did. Honorable Hugh S. Thompson, ex-Governor of\r\nSouth Carolina, was made Commissioner at the same time that I was,\r\nand after serving for three years resigned. He was succeeded by Mr.\r\nGeorge D. Johnston, of Louisiana, who was removed by the President\r\nin November, 1893, being replaced by Mr. John R. Procter, the former\r\nState Geologist of Kentucky, who is still serving. The Commission\r\nhas never varied a hand’s-breadth from its course throughout this\r\ntime; and Messrs. Thompson, Procter, Lyman, and myself were always a\r\nunit in all important questions of policy and principle. Our aim was\r\nalways to procure the extension of the classified service as rapidly\r\nas possible, and to see that the law was administered thoroughly and\r\nfairly. The Commission does not have the power that it should, and in\r\nmany instances there have been violations or evasions of the law in\r\nparticular bureaus or departments which the Commission was not able to\r\nprevent. In every case, however, we made a resolute fight, and gave\r\nthe widest publicity to the wrong-doing. Often, even where we have been\r\nunable to win the actual fight in which we were engaged, the fact of\r\nour having made it, and the further fact that we were ready to repeat\r\nit on provocation, has put a complete stop to the repetition of the\r\noffence. As a consequence, while there have been plenty of violations\r\nand evasions of the law, yet their proportion was really very small,\r\ntaking into account the extent of the service. In the aggregate it is\r\ndoubtful if one per cent. of all the employees have been dismissed for\r\npolitical reasons. In other words, where under the spoils system a\r\nhundred men would have been turned out, under the Civil Service Law, as\r\nadministered under our supervision, ninety-nine men were kept in.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the law very much depends upon the Commission.\r\nGood heads of departments and bureaus will administer it well anyhow;\r\nbut not only the bad men, but also the large class of men who are weak\r\nrather than bad, are sure to administer the law poorly unless kept well\r\nup to the mark. The public should exercise a most careful scrutiny\r\nover the appointment and over the acts of Civil Service Commissioners,\r\nfor there is no office the effectiveness of which depends so much upon\r\nthe way in which the man himself chooses to construe his duties. A\r\nCommissioner can keep within the letter of the law and do his routine\r\nwork and yet accomplish absolutely nothing in the way of securing\r\nthe observance of the law. The Commission, to do useful work, must\r\nbe fearless and vigilant. It must actively interfere whenever wrong\r\nis done, and must take all the steps that can be taken to secure the\r\npunishment of the wrong-doer and to protect the employee threatened\r\nwith molestation.\r\n\r\nThis course was consistently followed by the Commission throughout\r\nmy connection with it. I was myself a Republican from the North.\r\nMessrs. Thompson and Procter were from the South, and were both\r\nDemocrats who had served in the Confederate armies; and it would be\r\nimpossible for anyone to desire as associates two public men with\r\nhigher ideals of duty, or more resolute in their adherence to those\r\nideals. It is unnecessary to say that in all our dealings there was no\r\nsingle instance wherein the politics of any person or the political\r\nsignificance of any action was so much as taken into account in any\r\ncase that arose. The force of the Commission itself was all chosen\r\nthrough the competitive examinations, and included men of every party\r\nand from every section of the country; and I do not believe that in any\r\npublic or private office of the size it would be possible to find a\r\nmore honest, efficient, and coherent body of workers.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the present system each President of the\r\nUnited States has been its friend, but no President has been a\r\nradical Civil Service reformer. Presidents Arthur, Harrison, and\r\nCleveland have all desired to see the service extended, and to see\r\nthe law well administered. No one of them has felt willing or able\r\nto do all that the reformers asked, or to pay much heed to their\r\nwishes save as regards that portion of the service to which the law\r\nactually applied. Each has been a sincere party man, who has felt\r\nstrongly on such questions as those of the tariff, of finance, and\r\nof our foreign policy, and each has been obliged to conform more\r\nor less closely to the wishes of his party associates and fellow\r\nparty leaders; and, of course, these party leaders, and the party\r\npoliticians generally, wished the offices to be distributed as they\r\nhad been ever since Andrew Jackson became President. In consequence\r\nthe offices outside the protection of the law have still been treated,\r\nunder every administration, as patronage, to be disposed of in the\r\ninterest of the dominant party. An occasional exception was made here\r\nand there. The postmaster at New York, a Republican, was retained by\r\nPresident Cleveland in his first administration, and the postmaster\r\nof Charleston, a Democrat, was retained by President Harrison; but,\r\nwith altogether insignificant exceptions, the great bulk of the\r\nnon-classified places have been changed for political reasons by\r\neach administration, the office-holders politically opposed to the\r\nadministration being supplanted or succeeded by political adherents of\r\nthe administration.\r\n\r\nWhere the change has been complete it does not matter much whether it\r\nwas made rapidly or slowly. Thus, the fourth-class postmasterships were\r\nlooted more rapidly under the administration of President Harrison\r\nthan under that of President Cleveland, and the consular service more\r\nrapidly under President Cleveland than under President Harrison; but\r\nthe final result was the same in both cases. Indeed, I think that the\r\nbrutality which accompanied the greater speed was in some ways of\r\nservice to the country, for it directed attention to the iniquity and\r\nfolly of the system, and emphasized, in the minds of decent citizens,\r\nthe fact that appointments and removals for political reasons in places\r\nwhere the duties are wholly non-political cannot be defended by any man\r\nwho looks at public affairs from the proper standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe advance has been made purely on two lines, that is, by better\r\nenforcement of the law, and by inclusion under the law, or under\r\nsome system similar in its operations, of a portion of the service\r\npreviously administered in accordance with the spoils theory. Under\r\nPresident Arthur the first classification was made, which included\r\n14,000 places. Under President Cleveland, during his first term, the\r\nlimits of the classified service were extended by the inclusion of\r\n7000 additional places. During President Harrison’s term the limit was\r\nextended by the inclusion of about eight thousand places; and hitherto\r\nduring President Cleveland’s second term, by the inclusion of some six\r\nthousand places; in addition to which the natural growth of the service\r\nhas been such that the total number of offices now classified is over\r\nforty thousand. Moreover, the Secretary of the Navy under President\r\nHarrison, introduced into the navy yards a system of registration\r\nof laborers, which secures the end desired by the Commission; and\r\nSecretary Herbert has continued this system. It only rests, however,\r\nupon the will of the Secretary of the Navy; and as we cannot expect\r\nalways to have secretaries as clear-sighted as Messrs. Tracy and\r\nHerbert, it is most desirable that this branch of the service should be\r\nput directly under the control of the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet officers, though often not Civil Service reformers to\r\nstart with, usually become such before their terms of office expire.\r\nThis was true, without exception, of all the Cabinet officers with\r\nwhom I was personally brought into contact while on the Commission.\r\nMoreover, from their position and their sense of responsibility they\r\nare certain to refrain from violating the law themselves and to try to\r\nsecure at least a formal compliance with its demands on the part of\r\ntheir subordinates. In most cases it is necessary, however, to goad\r\nthem continually to see that they do not allow their subordinates to\r\nevade the law; and it is very difficult to get either the President or\r\nthe head of a department to punish these subordinates when they have\r\nevaded it. There is not much open violation of the law, because such\r\nviolation can be reached through the courts; but in the small offices\r\nand small bureaus there is often a chance for an unscrupulous head of\r\nthe office or bureau to persecute his subordinates who are politically\r\nopposed to him into resigning, or to trump up charges against them on\r\nwhich they can be dismissed. If this is done in a sufficient number of\r\ncases, men of the opposite political party think that it is useless to\r\nenter the examinations; and by staying out they leave the way clear\r\nfor the offender to get precisely the men he wishes for the eligible\r\nregisters. Cases like this continually occur, and the Commission\r\nhas to be vigilant in detecting and exposing them, and in demanding\r\ntheir punishment by the head of the office. The offender always, of\r\ncourse, insists that he has been misunderstood, and in most cases he\r\ncan prepare quite a specious defence. As he is of the same political\r\nfaith as the head of the department, and as he is certain to be backed\r\nby influential politicians, the head of the department is usually\r\nloath to act against him, and, if possible, will let him off with, at\r\nmost, a warning not to repeat the offence. In some departments this\r\nkind of evasion has never been tolerated; and where the Commission\r\nhas the force under its eye, as in the departments at Washington,\r\nthe chance of injustice is minimized. Nevertheless, there have been\r\nconsiderable abuses of this kind, notably in the custom-houses and\r\npost-offices, throughout the time I have been at Washington. So far as\r\nthe Post-Office Department was concerned the abuses were more flagrant\r\nunder President Harrison’s Postmaster-General, Mr. Wanamaker; but\r\nin the Treasury Department they were more flagrant under President\r\nCleveland’s Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Carlisle.\r\n\r\nCongress has control of the appropriations for the Commission, and\r\nas it cannot do its work without an ample appropriation the action\r\nof Congress is vital to its welfare. Many, even of the friends of\r\nthe system in the country at large, are astonishingly ignorant of who\r\nthe men are who have battled most effectively for the law and for\r\ngood government in either the Senate or the Lower House. It is not\r\nonly necessary that a man shall be good and possess the desire to do\r\ndecent things, but it is also necessary that he shall be courageous,\r\npractical, and efficient, if his work is to amount to anything. There\r\nis a good deal of rough-and-tumble fighting in Congress, as there is\r\nin all our political life, and a man is entirely out of place in it\r\nif he does not possess the virile qualities, and if he fails to show\r\nhimself ready and able to hit back when assailed. Moreover, he must\r\nbe alert, vigorous, and intelligent if he is going to make his work\r\ncount. The friends of the Civil Service Law, like the friends of all\r\nother laws, would be in a bad way if they had to rely solely upon the\r\nbacking of the timid good. During the last six years there have been,\r\nas there always are, a number of men in the House who believe in the\r\nCivil Service Law, and who vote for it if they understand the question\r\nand are present when it comes up, but who practically count for very\r\nlittle one way or the other, because they are timid or flighty, or are\r\nlacking in capacity for leadership or ability to see a point and to put\r\nit strongly before their associates.\r\n\r\nThere is need of further legislation to perfect and extend the law\r\nand the system; but Congress has never been willing seriously to\r\nconsider a proposition looking to this extension. Bills to provide for\r\nthe appointment of fourth-class postmasters have been introduced by\r\nSenator Lodge and others, but have never come to anything. Indeed, but\r\nonce has a measure of this kind been reported from committee and fought\r\nfor in either House. This was in the last session of the 53d Congress,\r\nwhen Senators Morgan and Lodge introduced bills to reform the consular\r\nservice. They were referred to Senator Morgan’s Committee on Foreign\r\nAffairs, and were favorably reported. Senator Lodge made a vigorous\r\nfight for them in the Senate, but he received little support, and was\r\ndefeated, Senator Gorman leading the opposition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, efforts to repeal the law, or to destroy it by\r\nnew legislation, have uniformly been failures, and have rarely gone\r\nbeyond committee. Occasionally, in an appropriation bill or some other\r\nmeasure, an amendment will be slipped through, adding forty or fifty\r\nemployees to the classified service, or providing that the law shall\r\nnot apply to them; but nothing important has ever been done in this\r\nway. But once has there been a resolute attack made on the law by\r\nlegislation. This was in the 53d Congress, when Mr. Bynum, of Indiana,\r\nintroduced in the House, and Mr. Vilas, of Wisconsin, pushed in the\r\nSenate, a bill to reinstate the Democratic railway mail clerks, turned\r\nout before the classification of the railway mail service in the early\r\ndays of Mr. Harrison’s administration.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the railway mail service was ordered by President\r\nCleveland less than two months before the expiration of his first\r\nterm of office as President. It was impossible for the Commission to\r\nprepare and hold the necessary examinations and establish eligible\r\nregisters prior to May 1, 1889. President Harrison had been inaugurated\r\non March 4th, and Postmaster-General Wanamaker permitted the spoilsmen\r\nto take advantage of the necessary delay and turn out half of the\r\nemployees who were Democrats, and replace them by Republicans.\r\nThis was an outrageous act, deserving the severe condemnation it\r\nreceived; but it was perfectly legal. During the four years of Mr.\r\nCleveland’s first term a clean sweep was made of the railway mail\r\nservice; the employees who were almost all Republicans, were turned\r\nout, and Democrats were put in their places. The result was utterly to\r\ndemoralize the efficiency of the service. It had begun to recover from\r\nthis when the change of administration took place in 1889. The time\r\nwas too short to allow of a clean sweep, but the Republicans did all\r\nthey could in two months, and turned out half of the Democrats. The\r\nlaw then went into effect, and since that time there have been no more\r\nremovals for partisan purposes in that service. It has now recovered\r\nfrom the demoralization into which it was thrown by the two political\r\nrevolutions, and has reached a higher standard of efficiency than ever\r\nbefore. What was done by the Republicans in this service was repeated,\r\non a less scale, by the Democrats four years later in reference to\r\nthe classification of the small free-delivery post-offices. This\r\nclassification was ordered by President Harrison two months before his\r\nterm of office expired; but in many of the offices it was impossible\r\nto hold examinations and prepare eligible registers until after the\r\ninauguration of President Cleveland, and in a number of cases the\r\nincoming postmasters, who were appointed prior to the time when the\r\nlaw went into effect, took advantage of the delay to make clean sweeps\r\nof their offices. In one of these offices, where the men were changed\r\nin a body, the new appointees hired the men whom they replaced, at $35\r\na month apiece, to teach them their duties; in itself a sufficient\r\ncomment on the folly of the spoils system.\r\n\r\nMr. Bynum’s bill provided for the reinstatement of the Democrats who\r\nwere turned out by the Republicans just before the classification of\r\nthe railway mail service. Of course such a bill was a mere partisan\r\nmeasure. There was no more reason for reinstating the Democrats thus\r\nturned out than for reinstating the Republicans who had been previously\r\nturned out that these same Democrats might get in, or for reinstating\r\nthe Republicans in the free-delivery offices who had been turned out\r\njust before these offices were classified. If the bill had been enacted\r\ninto law it would have been a most serious blow to the whole system,\r\nfor it would have put a premium upon legislation of the kind; and after\r\nevery change of parties we should have seen the passing of laws to\r\nreinstate masses of Republicans or Democrats, as the case might be.\r\nThis would have meant a return to the old system under a new form of\r\nprocedure. Nevertheless, Mr. Bynum’s bill received the solid support\r\nof his party. Not a Democratic vote was cast against it in the House,\r\nnone even of the Massachusetts Democrats being recorded against it.\r\nIn the Senate it was pushed by Mr. Vilas. By a piece of rather sharp\r\nparliamentary procedure he nearly got it through by unanimous consent.\r\nThat it failed was owing entirely to the vigilance of Senator Lodge.\r\nSenator Vilas asked for the passage of the bill, on the ground that it\r\nwas one of small importance, upon which his committee were agreed. When\r\nit was read the words “classified civil service” caught Senator Lodge’s\r\near, and he insisted upon an explanation. On finding out what the bill\r\nwas he at once objected to its consideration. Under this objection it\r\ncould not then be considered. If it could have been brought to a vote\r\nit would undoubtedly have passed; but it was late in the session, the\r\ncalendars were crowded with bills, and it was impossible to get it up\r\nin its regular order. Another effort was made, and was again frustrated\r\nby Senator Lodge, and the bill then died a natural death.\r\n\r\nIn the final session of the 53d Congress a little incident occurred\r\nwhich deserves to be related in full, not for its own importance, but\r\nbecause it affords an excellent example of the numerous cases which\r\ntest the real efficiency of the friends of the reform in Congress.\r\nIt emphasizes the need of having, to watch over the interests of the\r\nlaw, a man who is willing to fight, who knows the time to fight,\r\nand who knows how to fight. The secretary of the Commission was, in\r\nthe original law of 1883, allowed a salary of $1600 a year. As the\r\nCommission’s force and work have grown, the salary in successive\r\nappropriation bills for the last ten years has been provided for at\r\nthe rate of $2000 a year. Many of the clerks under the secretary now\r\nreceive $1800, so that it would be of course an absurdity to reduce\r\nhim in salary below his subordinates. Scores of other officials of the\r\nGovernment, including, for instance, the President’s private secretary,\r\nthe First Assistant Postmaster-General, the First Assistant Secretary\r\nof State, etc., have had their salaries increased in successive\r\nappropriation bills over the sum originally provided, in precisely\r\nthe same way that the salary of the secretary of the Commission was\r\nincreased. The 53d Congress was Democratic, as was the President, Mr.\r\nCleveland, and the secretary of the Commission was himself a Democrat,\r\nwho had been appointed to the position by Mr. Cleveland during his\r\nfirst term as President. The rules of the House provide that there\r\nshall be no increase of salary beyond that provided in existing law in\r\nany appropriation bill. When the appropriation for the Civil Service\r\nCommission came up in the House, Mr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky,\r\nmade the point of order that to give $2000 to the secretary of the\r\nCommission was to increase his salary by $400 over that provided in the\r\noriginal law of 1883, and was therefore out of order. He also produced\r\na list of twenty or thirty other officers, including the President’s\r\nprivate secretary, the First Assistant Postmaster-General, etc., whose\r\nsalaries were similarly increased. He withdrew his point of order as\r\nregards these persons, but adhered to it as regards the secretary\r\nof the Commission. The chairman of the Committee of the Whole, Mr.\r\nO’Neill, of Massachusetts, sustained the point of order; and not one\r\nperson made any objection or made any fight, and the bill was put\r\nthrough the House with the secretary’s salary reduced.\r\n\r\nNow, the point of order was probably ill taken anyhow. The existing\r\nlaw was and had been for ten years that the salary was $2000. But, in\r\nany event, had there been a single Congressman alert to the situation\r\nand willing to make a fight he could have stopped the whole movement\r\nby at once making a similar point of order against the President’s\r\nprivate secretary, against the First Assistant Postmaster-General,\r\nthe Assistant Secretary of State, and all the others involved. The\r\nHouse would of course have refused to cut down the salaries of all\r\nof these officials, and a resolute man, willing to insist that they\r\nshould all go or none, could have saved the salary of the secretary\r\nof the Civil Service Commission. There were plenty of men who would\r\nhave done this if it had been pointed out to them; but no one did so,\r\nand Mr. Breckinridge’s point of order was sustained, and the salary\r\nof the secretary reduced by $400. When it got over to the Senate,\r\nhowever, the Civil Service reformers had allies who needed but little\r\ncoaching. In the first place, the sub-committee of the Committee on\r\nAppropriations, composed of Messrs. Teller, Cockrell, and Allison,\r\nto which the Civil Service Commission section of the Appropriation\r\nbill was referred, restored the salary to $2000; but Senator Gorman\r\nsucceeded in carrying, by a bare majority, the Appropriations Committee\r\nagainst it, and it was reported to the full Senate still at $1600. The\r\nminute it got into the full Senate, however, Senator Lodge had a fair\r\nchance at it, and it was known that he would receive ample support.\r\nAll that he had to do was to show clearly the absolute folly of the\r\nprovision thus put in by Mr. Breckinridge, and kept in by Mr. Gorman,\r\nand to make it evident that he intended to fight it resolutely. The\r\nopposition collapsed at once; the salary was put back at $2000, and the\r\nbill became a law in that form.\r\n\r\nWhether bad legislation shall be choked and good legislation forwarded\r\ndepends largely upon the composition of the committees on Civil\r\nService reform of the Senate and the Lower House. The make-up of these\r\ncommittees is consequently of great importance. They are charged with\r\nthe duty of investigating complaints against the Commission, and it is\r\nof course very important that if ever the Commission becomes corrupt\r\nor inefficient its shortcomings should be unsparingly exposed in\r\nCongress. On the other hand, it is equally important that the falsity\r\nof untruthful charges advanced against it should be made public. In the\r\n51st, 52d, and 53d Congresses a good deal of work was done by the Civil\r\nService Committee of the House, and none at all by the corresponding\r\ncommittee of the Senate. The three chairmen of the House committee were\r\nMr. Lehlbach, Mr. Andrew, and Mr. De Forest. All three were able and\r\nconscientious men and stanch supporters of the law. The chairman in\r\nthe 52d Congress, Mr. John F. Andrew, was throughout his whole term of\r\nservice one of the ablest, most fearless, and most effective champions\r\nof the cause of the reform in the House. Among the other members of\r\nthe committee, in different Congresses, who stood up valiantly for\r\nthe reform, were Mr. Hopkins, of Illinois, Mr. Butterworth, of Ohio,\r\nMr. Boatner, of Louisiana, and Mr. Dargan and Mr. Brawley, of South\r\nCarolina. Occasionally there have been on the committee members who\r\nwere hostile to the reform, such as Mr. Alderson, of West Virginia;\r\nbut these have not been men carrying weight in the House. The men of\r\nintelligence and ability who once familiarize themselves with the\r\nworkings of the system, as they are bound to do if they are on the\r\ncommittee, are sure to become its supporters. In both the 51st and\r\nthe 52d Congresses charges were made against the Commission, and\r\ninvestigations were held into its actions and into the workings of the\r\nlaw by the House committee. In each case, in its report the committee\r\nnot only heartily applauded the conduct of the Commission, but no less\r\nheartily approved the workings of the law, and submitted bills to\r\nincrease the power of the Commission and to render the law still more\r\nwide-reaching and drastic. These bills, unfortunately, were never acted\r\non in the House.\r\n\r\nThe main fight in each session comes on the Appropriation bill. There\r\nis not the slightest danger that the law will be repealed, and there\r\nis not much danger that any President will suffer it to be so laxly\r\nadministered as to deprive it of all value; though there is always\r\nneed to keep a vigilant lookout for fear of such lax administration.\r\nThe danger-point is in the appropriations. The first Civil Service\r\nCommission, established in the days of President Grant, was starved\r\nout by Congress refusing to appropriate for it. A hostile Congress\r\ncould repeat the same course now; and, as a matter of fact, in every\r\nCongress resolute efforts are made by the champions of foul government\r\nand dishonest politics to cut off the Commission’s supplies. The bolder\r\nmen, who come from districts where little is known of the law, and\r\nwhere there is no adequate expression of intelligent and honest opinion\r\non the subject, attack it openly. They are always joined by a number\r\nwho make the attack covertly under some point of order, or because of a\r\nnominal desire for economy. These are quite as dangerous as the others,\r\nand deserve exposure. Every man interested in decent government should\r\nkeep an eye on his Congressman and see how he votes on the question of\r\nappropriations for the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the reform is generally well led by skilled\r\nparliamentarians, and they fight with the vindictiveness natural to\r\nmen who see a chance of striking at the institution which has baffled\r\ntheir ferocious greed. As a rule, the rank and file are composed of\r\npoliticians who could not rise in public life because of their attitude\r\non any public question, and who derive most of their power from the\r\nskill with which they manipulate the patronage of their districts.\r\nThese men have a gift at office-mongering, just as other men have a\r\npeculiar knack in picking pockets; and they are joined by all the\r\nhonest dull men, who vote wrong out of pure ignorance, and by a very\r\nfew sincere and intelligent, but wholly misguided people. Many of the\r\nspoils leaders are both efficient and fearless, and able to strike\r\nhard blows. In consequence, the leaders on the side of decency must\r\nthemselves be men of ability and force, or the cause will suffer. For\r\nour good fortune, we have never yet lacked such leaders.\r\n\r\nThe Appropriation committees, both in the House and Senate, almost\r\ninvariably show a friendly disposition toward the law. They are\r\ncomposed of men of prominence, who have a sense of the responsibilities\r\nof their positions and an earnest desire to do well for the country and\r\nto make an honorable record for their party in matters of legislation.\r\nThey are usually above resorting to the arts of low cunning or of sheer\r\ndemagogy to which the foes of the reform system are inevitably driven,\r\nand in consequence they can be relied upon to give, if not what is\r\nneeded, at least enough to prevent any retrogression. It is in the open\r\nHouse and in Committee of the Whole that the fight is waged. The most\r\ndangerous fight occurs in Committee of the Whole, for there the members\r\ndo not vote by aye and no, and in consequence a mean politician who\r\nwishes ill to the law, but is afraid of his constituents, votes against\r\nit in committee, but does not dare to do so when the ayes and noes\r\nare called in the House. One result of this has been that more than\r\nonce the whole appropriation has been stricken out in Committee of the\r\nWhole, and then voted back again by substantial majorities by the same\r\nmen sitting in open House.\r\n\r\nIn the debate on the appropriation the whole question of the workings\r\nof the law is usually discussed, and those members who are opposed to\r\nit attack not only the law itself, but the Commission which administers\r\nit. The occasion is, therefore, invariably seized as an opportunity\r\nfor a pitched battle between the friends and foes of the system, the\r\nformer trying to secure such an increase of appropriation as will\r\npermit the Commission to extend its work, and the latter striving to\r\nabolish the law outright by refusing all appropriations. In the 51st\r\nand 52d Congresses, Mr. Lodge, of Massachusetts, led the fight for the\r\nreform in the Lower House. He was supported by such party leaders as\r\nMessrs. Reed, of Maine, and McKinley, of Ohio, among the Republicans,\r\nand Messrs. Wilson, of West Virginia, and Sayers, of Texas, among\r\nthe Democrats. Among the other champions of the law on the floor of\r\nthe House were Messrs. Hopkins and Butterworth, Mr. Greenhalge, of\r\nMassachusetts, Mr. Henderson, of Iowa, Messrs. Payne, Tracey, and\r\nCoombs, of New York. I wish I had the space to chronicle the names\r\nof all, and to give a complete list of those who voted for the law.\r\nAmong the chief opponents of it were Messrs. Spinola, of New York,\r\nEnloe, of Tennessee, Stockdale, of Mississippi, Grosvenor, of Ohio,\r\nand Bowers, of California. The task of the defenders of the law was,\r\nin one way easy, for they had no arguments to meet, the speeches of\r\ntheir adversaries being invariably divisible into mere declamation\r\nand direct misstatement of facts. In the Senate, Senators Hoar, of\r\nMassachusetts, Allison, of Iowa, Hawley, of Connecticut, Wolcott, of\r\nColorado, Perkins, of California, Cockrell, of Missouri, and Butler, of\r\nSouth Carolina, always supported the Commission against unjust attack.\r\nSenator Gorman was naturally the chief leader of the assaults upon the\r\nCommission. Senators Harris, Plumb, Stewart, and Ingalls were among his\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nIn each session the net result of the fight was an increase in the\r\nappropriation for the Commission. The most important increase was\r\nthat obtained in the first session of the 53d Congress. On this\r\noccasion Mr. Lodge was no longer in the House, having been elected\r\nto the Senate. The work of the Commission had grown so that it was\r\nimpossible to perform it without a great increase of force; and it\r\nwould have been impossible to have put into effect the extensions of\r\nthe classified service had this increase not been allowed. In the House\r\nthe Committee on Appropriations, of which Mr. Sayers was chairman,\r\nallowed the increase, but it was stricken out in the House itself after\r\nan acrimonious debate, in which the cause of the law was sustained\r\nby Messrs. Henderson and Hopkins, Mr. McCall, of Massachusetts, Mr.\r\nCoombs, Mr. Crain, of Texas, Mr. Storer, of Ohio, and many others,\r\nwhile the spoils-mongers were led by Messrs. Stockdale and Williams,\r\nof Mississippi, Pendelton, of West Virginia, Fithian, of Illinois, and\r\nothers less important.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill went over to the Senate, however, Mr. Lodge, well\r\nsupported by Messrs. Allison, Cockrell, Wolcott, and Teller, had the\r\nprovision for the increase of appropriation for the Commission restored\r\nand increased, thereby adding by one half to the efficiency of the\r\nCommission’s work. Had it not been for this the Commission would have\r\nbeen quite unable to have undertaken the extensions recently ordered by\r\nPresident Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the men who have done most effective work for the\r\nlaw in Washington in the departments, and more especially in the House\r\nand Senate, are men of spotless character, who show by their whole\r\ncourse in public life that they are not only able and resolute, but\r\nalso devoted to a high ideal. Much of what they have done has received\r\nlittle comment in public, because much of the work in committee, and\r\nsome of the work in the House, such as making or combating points of\r\norder, and pointing out the danger or merit of certain bills, is not\r\nof a kind readily understood or appreciated by an outsider; yet no men\r\nhave deserved better of the country, for there is in American public\r\nlife no one other cause so fruitful of harm to the body-politic as the\r\nspoils system, and the legislators and administrative officers who have\r\ndone the best work toward its destruction merit a peculiar meed of\r\npraise from all well-wishers of the Republic.\r\n\r\nI have spoken above of the good that would come from a thorough and\r\nintelligent knowledge as to who were the friends and who were the foes\r\nof the law in Washington. Departmental officers, the heads of bureaus,\r\nand, above all, the Commissioners themselves, should be carefully\r\nwatched by all friends of the reform. They should be supported when\r\nthey do well, and condemned when they do ill; and attention should\r\nbe called not only to what they do, but to what they fail to do. To\r\nan even greater extent, of course, this applies to the President. As\r\nregards the Senators and Congressmen also there is urgent need of\r\ncareful supervision by the friends of the law. We need criticism by\r\nthose who are unable to do their part in action; but the criticism, to\r\nbe useful, must be both honest and intelligent, and the critics must\r\nremember that the system has its stanch friends and bitter foes among\r\nboth party men and men of no party--among Republicans, Democrats,\r\nand Independents. Each Congressman should be made to feel that it is\r\nhis duty to support the law, and that he will be held to account if\r\nhe fails to support it. Especially is it necessary to concentrate\r\neffort in working for each step of reform. In legislative matters,\r\nfor instance, there is need of increase of appropriations for the\r\nCommission, and there is a chance of putting through the bill to reform\r\nthe Consular service. This has received substantial backing in the\r\nSenate, and has the support of the majority of the Foreign Affairs\r\nCommittee. Instead of wasting efforts by a diffuse support of eight\r\nor ten bills, it would be well to bend every energy to securing the\r\npassage of the Consular bill; and to do this it is necessary to arouse\r\nnot only the Civil Service Reform Associations, but the Boards of Trade\r\nthroughout the country, and to make the Congressmen and Senators feel\r\nindividually the pressure from those of their constituents who are\r\nresolved no longer to tolerate the peculiarly gross manifestation of\r\nthe spoils system which now obtains in the consular service, with its\r\nattendant discredit to the national honor abroad.\r\n\r\nPeople sometimes grow a little down-hearted about the reform. When\r\nthey feel in this mood it would be well for them to reflect on what\r\nhas actually been gained in the past six years. By the inclusion of\r\nthe railway mail service, the smaller free-delivery offices, the\r\nIndian School service, the Internal Revenue service, and other less\r\nimportant branches, the extent of the public service which is under\r\nthe protection of the law has been more than doubled, and there are\r\nnow nearly fifty thousand employees of the Federal Government who have\r\nbeen withdrawn from the degrading influences that rule under the spoils\r\nsystem. This of itself is a great success and a great advance, though,\r\nof course, it ought only to spur us on to renewed effort. In the fall\r\nof 1894 the people of the State of New York, by a popular vote, put\r\ninto their constitution a provision providing for a merit system in the\r\naffairs of the State and its municipalities; and the following spring\r\nthe great city of Chicago voted, by an overwhelming majority, in favor\r\nof applying in its municipal affairs the advanced and radical Civil\r\nService Reform Law, which had already passed the Illinois Legislature.\r\nUndoubtedly, after every success there comes a moment of reaction. The\r\nfriends of the reform grow temporarily lukewarm, or, because it fails\r\nto secure everything they hoped, they neglect to lay proper stress\r\nupon all that it does secure. Yet, in spite of all rebuffs, in spite\r\nof all disappointments and opposition, the growth of the principle of\r\nCivil Service reform has been continually more rapid, and every year\r\nhas taken us measurably nearer that ideal of pure and decent government\r\nwhich is dear to the heart of every honest American citizen.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] _Scribner’s Magazine_, August, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII\r\n\r\n              ADMINISTERING THE NEW YORK POLICE FORCE[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn New York, in the fall of 1894, Tammany Hall was overthrown by\r\na coalition composed partly of the regular republicans, partly of\r\nanti-Tammany democrats, and partly of independents. Under the latter\r\nhead must be included a great many men who in national politics\r\nhabitually act with one or the other of the two great parties,\r\nbut who feel that in municipal politics good citizens should act\r\nindependently. The tidal wave, which was running high against the\r\ndemocratic party, was undoubtedly very influential in bringing about\r\nthe anti-Tammany victory; but the chief factor in producing the\r\nresult was the wide-spread anger and disgust felt by decent citizens\r\nat the corruption which, under the sway of Tammany, had honey-combed\r\nevery department of the city government, but especially the police\r\nforce. A few well-meaning people have at times tried to show that\r\nthis corruption was not really so very great. In reality it would be\r\ndifficult to overestimate the utter rottenness of many branches of\r\nthe city administration. There were a few honorable and high-minded\r\nTammany officials, and there were a few bureaus which were administered\r\nwith more or less efficiency, although dishonestly. But the corruption\r\nhad become so wide-spread as seriously to impair the work of\r\nadministration, and to bring us back within measurable distance of the\r\ndays of Tweed.\r\n\r\nThe chief centre of corruption was the Police Department. No man not\r\nintimately acquainted with both the lower and humbler sides of New York\r\nlife--for there is a wide distinction between the two--can realize\r\nhow far this corruption extended. Except in rare instances, where\r\nprominent politicians made demands which could not be refused, both\r\npromotions and appointments towards the close of Tammany rule were made\r\nalmost solely for money, and the prices were discussed with cynical\r\nfrankness. There was a well-recognized tariff of charges, ranging from\r\ntwo or three hundred dollars for appointment as a patrolman, to twelve\r\nor fifteen thousand dollars for promotion to the position of captain.\r\nThe money was reimbursed to those who paid it by an elaborate system\r\nof blackmail. This was chiefly carried on at the expense of gamblers,\r\nliquor sellers, and keepers of disorderly houses; but every form of\r\nvice and crime contributed more or less, and a great many respectable\r\npeople who were ignorant or timid were blackmailed under pretence of\r\nforbidding or allowing them to violate obscure ordinances and the like.\r\nFrom top to bottom the New York police force was utterly demoralized\r\nby the gangrene of such a system, where venality and blackmail went\r\nhand in hand with the basest forms of low ward politics, and where the\r\npoliceman, the ward politician, the liquor seller, and the criminal\r\nalternately preyed on one another and helped one another to prey on the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, I was made president of the newly appointed police board,\r\nwhose duty it was to cut out the chief source of civic corruption in\r\nNew York by cleansing the police department. The police board consisted\r\nof four members. All four of the new men were appointed by Mayor\r\nStrong, the reform Mayor, who had taken office in January.\r\n\r\nWith me, was associated, as treasurer of the Board, Mr. Avery D.\r\nAndrews. He was a democrat and I a republican, and there were questions\r\nof national politics on which we disagreed widely; but such questions\r\ncould not enter into the administration of the New York police, if that\r\nadministration was to be both honest and efficient; and as a matter\r\nof fact, during my two years’ service, Mr. Andrews and I worked in\r\nabsolute harmony on every important question of policy which arose. The\r\nprevention of blackmail and corruption, the repression of crime and\r\nviolence, safeguarding of life and property, securing honest elections,\r\nand rewarding efficient and punishing inefficient police service, are\r\nnot, and cannot properly be made, questions of party difference. In\r\nother words, such a body as the police force of New York can be wisely\r\nand properly administered only upon a non-partisan basis, and both Mr.\r\nAndrews and myself were quite incapable of managing it on any other.\r\nThere were many men who helped us in our work; and among them all,\r\nthe man who helped us most, by advice and counsel, by stalwart, loyal\r\nfriendship, and by ardent championship of all that was good against all\r\nthat was evil, was Jacob A. Riis, the author of _How the Other Half\r\nLives_.\r\n\r\nCertain of the difficulties we had to face were merely those which\r\nconfronted the entire reform administration in its management of\r\nthe municipality. Many worthy people expected that this reform\r\nadministration would work an absolute revolution, not merely in the\r\ngovernment, but in the minds of the citizens as a whole; and felt\r\nvaguely that they had been cheated because there was not an immediate\r\ncleansing of every bad influence in civic or social life. Moreover, the\r\ndifferent bodies forming the victorious coalition felt the pressure of\r\nconflicting interests and hopes. The mass of effective strength was\r\ngiven by the republican organization, and not only all the enrolled\r\nparty workers, but a great number of well-meaning republicans who had\r\nno personal interest at stake, expected the administration to be used\r\nto further the fortunes of their own party. Another great body of the\r\nadministration’s supporters took a diametrically opposite view, and\r\nbelieved that the administration should be administered without the\r\nleast reference whatever to party. In theory they were quite right,\r\nand I cordially sympathized with them; but as a matter of fact the\r\nvictory could not have been won by the votes of this class of people\r\nalone, and it was out of the question to put these theories into\r\ncomplete effect. Like all other men who actually try to do things\r\ninstead of confining themselves to saying how they should be done, the\r\nmembers of the new city government were obliged to face the facts and\r\nto do the best they could in the effort to get some kind of good result\r\nout of the conflicting forces. They had to disregard party so far as\r\nwas possible; and yet they could not afford to disregard all party\r\nconnections so utterly as to bring the whole administration to grief.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two large groups of supporters of the\r\nadministration, there were other groups, also possessing influence\r\nwho expected to receive recognition distinctly as democrats, but as\r\nanti-Tammany democrats; and such members of any victorious coalition\r\nare always sure to overestimate their own services, and to feel\r\nill-treated.\r\n\r\nIt is of course an easy thing to show on paper that the municipal\r\nadministration should have been administered without the slightest\r\nreference to national party lines, and if the bulk of the people saw\r\nthings with entire clearness the truth would seem so obvious as to need\r\nno demonstration. But as a matter of fact the bulk of the people who\r\nvoted the new administration into power neither saw this nor realized\r\nit, and in politics, as in life generally, conditions must be faced\r\nas they are, and not as they ought to be. The regular democratic\r\norganization, not only in the city but in the State, was completely\r\nunder the dominion of Tammany Hall and its allies, and they fought\r\nus at every step with wholly unscrupulous hatred. In the State and\r\nthe city alike the democratic campaign was waged against the reform\r\nadministration in New York. The Tammany officials who were still\r\nleft in power in the city, headed by the comptroller, Mr. Fitch, did\r\neverything in their power to prevent the efficient administration of\r\nthe government. The democratic members of the Legislature acted as\r\ntheir faithful allies in all such efforts. Whatever was accomplished by\r\nthe reform administration--and a very great deal was accomplished--was\r\ndue to the action of the republican majority in the constitutional\r\nconvention, and especially to the republican Governor, Mr. Morton, and\r\nthe republican majority in the Legislature, who enacted laws giving\r\nto the newly chosen Mayor, Mr. Strong, the great powers necessary for\r\nproperly administering his office. Without these laws the Mayor would\r\nhave been very nearly powerless. He certainly could not have done a\r\ntenth part of what actually was done.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, the republican politicians who gave Mayor Strong all\r\nthese powers, in the teeth of violent democratic opposition to every\r\nlaw for the betterment of civic conditions in New York, ought not,\r\nunder ideal conditions, to have expected the slightest reward. They\r\nshould have been contented with showing the public that their only\r\npurpose was to serve the public, and that the republican party wished\r\nno better reward than the consciousness of having done its duty by\r\nthe State and the city. But as a whole they had not reached such a\r\nstandard. There were some who had reached it; there were others who,\r\nthough perfectly honest, and wishing to see good government prosper,\r\nyet felt that somehow it ought to be combined with party advantage of a\r\ntangible sort; and finally, there were yet others who were not honest\r\nat all and cared nothing for the victory unless it resulted in some\r\nway to their own personal advantage. In short, the problem presented\r\nwas of the kind which usually is presented when dealing with men as a\r\nmass. The Mayor and his administration had to keep in touch with the\r\nrepublican party or they could have accomplished nothing; and on the\r\nother hand there was much that the republican machine asked which they\r\ncould not do, because a surrender on certain vital points meant the\r\nabandonment of the effort to obtain good administration.\r\n\r\nThe undesirability of breaking with the republican organization was\r\nshown by what happened in the administration of the police department.\r\nThis being the great centre of power was the especial object of the\r\nrepublican machine leaders. Toward the close of Tammany rule, of the\r\nfour Police Commissioners, two had been machine republicans, whose\r\nactions were in no wise to be distinguished from those of their Tammany\r\ncolleagues; and immediately after the new board was appointed to office\r\nthe machine got through the Legislature the so-called bi-partisan or\r\nLexow law, under which the department is at present administered; and\r\na more foolish or vicious law was never enacted by any legislative\r\nbody. It modelled the government of the police force somewhat on the\r\nlines of the Polish parliament, and it was avowedly designed to make it\r\ndifficult to get effective action. It provided for a four-headed board,\r\nso that it was difficult to get a majority anyhow; but, lest we should\r\nget such a majority, it gave each member power to veto the actions of\r\nhis colleagues in certain very important matters; and, lest we should\r\ndo too much when we were unanimous, it provided that the chief, our\r\nnominal subordinate, should have entirely independent action in the\r\nmost important matters, and should be practically irremovable, except\r\nfor proved corruption; so that he was responsible to nobody. The Mayor\r\nwas similarly hindered from removing any Police Commissioner, so that\r\nwhen one of our colleagues began obstructing the work of the board,\r\nand thwarting its effort to reform the force, the Mayor in vain strove\r\nto turn him out. In short, there was a complete divorce of power and\r\nresponsibility, and it was exceedingly difficult either to do anything,\r\nor to place anywhere, the responsibility for not doing it.\r\n\r\nIf, by any reasonable concessions, if, indeed, by the performance\r\nof any act not incompatible with our oaths of office, we could have\r\nstood on good terms with the machine, we would certainly have made\r\nthe effort, even at the cost of sacrificing many of our ideals; and\r\nin almost any other department we could probably have avoided a\r\nbreak, but in the police force such a compromise was not possible.\r\nWhat was demanded of us usually took some such form as the refusal\r\nto enforce certain laws, or the protection of certain law-breakers,\r\nor the promotion of the least fit men to positions of high power and\r\ngrave responsibility; and on such points it was not possible to yield.\r\nWe were obliged to treat all questions that arose purely on their\r\nmerits, without reference to the desires of the politicians. We went\r\ninto this course with our eyes open, for we knew the trouble it would\r\ncause us personally, and, what was far more important, the way in which\r\nour efforts for reform would consequently be hampered. However, there\r\nwas no alternative, and we had to abide by the result. We had counted\r\nthe cost before we adopted our course, and we followed it resolutely\r\nto the end. We could not accomplish all that we should have liked to\r\naccomplish for we were shackled by preposterous legislation, and by\r\nthe opposition and intrigues of the basest machine politicians, which\r\ncost us the support, sometimes of one, and sometimes of both, of our\r\ncolleagues. Nevertheless, the net result of our two years of work was\r\nthat we did more to increase the efficiency and honesty of the police\r\ndepartment than had ever previously been done in its history.\r\n\r\nBut a decent people will have to show by emphatic action that they are\r\nin the majority if they wish this result to be permanent; for under\r\nsuch a law as the “bi-partisan” law it is almost impossible to keep\r\nthe department honest and efficient for any length of time; and the\r\nmachine politicians, by their opposition outside the board, and by the\r\naid of any tool or ally whom they can get on the board, can always\r\nhamper and cripple the honest members of the board, no matter how\r\nresolute and able the latter may be, if they do not have an aroused and\r\ndetermined public opinion behind them.\r\n\r\nBesides suffering, in aggravated form, from the difficulties which\r\nbeset the course of the entire administration, the police board had\r\nto encounter--and honest and efficient police boards must always\r\nencounter--certain special and peculiar difficulties. It is not a\r\npleasant thing to deal with criminals and purveyors of vice. It is very\r\nrough work, and it cannot always be done in a nice manner. The man\r\nwith the night stick, the man in the blue coat with the helmet, can\r\nkeep order and repress open violence on the streets; but most kinds\r\nof crime and vice are ordinarily carried on furtively and by stealth,\r\nperhaps at night, perhaps behind closed doors. It is possible to reach\r\nthem only by the employment of the man in plain clothes, the detective.\r\nNow the function of the detective is primarily that of the spy, and\r\nit is always easy to arouse feeling against a spy. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary to employ him. Ninety per cent. of the most dangerous\r\ncriminals and purveyors of vice cannot be reached in any other way.\r\nBut the average citizen who does not think deeply fails to realize\r\nthe necessity for any such employment. In a vague way he desires vice\r\nand crime put down; but, also in a vague way, he objects to the only\r\npossible means by which they can be put down. It is easy to mislead\r\nhim into denouncing what is necessarily done in order to carry out the\r\nvery policy for which he is clamoring. The Tammany officials of New\r\nYork, headed by the Comptroller, made a systematic effort to excite\r\npublic hostility against the police for their warfare on vice. The\r\nlaw-breaking liquor seller, the keeper of disorderly houses, and the\r\ngambler, had been influential allies of Tammany, and head contributors\r\nto its campaign chest. Naturally Tammany fought for them; and the\r\neffective way in which to carry on such a fight was to portray with\r\ngross exaggeration and misstatement the methods necessarily employed\r\nby every police force which honestly endeavors to do its work. The\r\nmethods are unpleasant, just as the methods employed in any surgical\r\noperation are unpleasant; and the Tammany champions were able to\r\narouse more or less feeling against the police board for precisely the\r\nsame reason that a century ago it was easy to arouse what were called\r\n“doctors’ mobs” against surgeons who cut up dead bodies. In neither\r\ncase is the operation attractive, and it is one which readily lends\r\nitself to denunciation; but in both cases it is necessary if there\r\nis a real intention to get at the disease. Tammany of course found\r\nits best allies in the sensational newspapers. Of all the forces that\r\ntend for evil in a great city like New York, probably none are so\r\npotent as the sensational papers. Until one has had experience with\r\nthem it is difficult to realize the reckless indifference to truth\r\nor decency displayed by papers such as the two that have the largest\r\ncirculation in New York City. Scandal forms the breath of the nostrils\r\nof such papers, and they are quite as ready to create as to describe\r\nit. To sustain law and order is humdrum, and does not readily lend\r\nitself to flaunting woodcuts; but if the editor will stoop, and make\r\nhis subordinates stoop, to raking the gutters of human depravity, to\r\nupholding the wrong-doer, and furiously assailing what is upright and\r\nhonest, he can make money, just as other types of pander make it. The\r\nman who is to do honorable work in any form of civic politics must make\r\nup his mind (and if he is a man of properly robust character he will\r\nmake it up without difficulty) to treat the assaults of papers like\r\nthese with absolute indifference, and to go his way unheeded. Indeed\r\nhe will have to make up his mind to be criticised, sometimes justly,\r\nand more often unjustly, even by decent people; and he must not be so\r\nthin-skinned as to mind such criticism overmuch.\r\n\r\nIn administering the police force we found, as might be expected,\r\nthat there was no need of genius, nor indeed of any very unusual\r\nqualities. What was needed was exercise of the plain, ordinary virtues,\r\nof a rather commonplace type, which all good citizens should be\r\nexpected to possess. Common sense, common honesty, courage, energy,\r\nresolution, readiness to learn, and a desire to be as pleasant with\r\neverybody as was compatible with a strict performance of duty--these\r\nwere the qualities most called for. We soon found that, in spite of\r\nthe wide-spread corruption which had obtained in the New York police\r\ndepartment, the bulk of the men were heartily desirous of being honest.\r\nThere were some who were incurably dishonest, just as there were some\r\nwho had remained decent in spite of terrific temptation and pressure;\r\nbut the great mass came in between. Although not possessing the stamina\r\nto war against corruption when the odds seemed well-nigh hopeless, they\r\nwere nevertheless heartily glad to be decent and to welcome the change\r\nto a system under which they were rewarded for doing well, and punished\r\nfor doing ill.\r\n\r\nOur methods for restoring order and discipline were simple, and indeed\r\nso were our methods for securing efficiency. We made frequent personal\r\ninspections, especially at night, turning up anywhere, at any time. We\r\nthus speedily got an idea of whom among our upper subordinates we could\r\ntrust and whom we could not. We then proceeded to punish those guilty\r\nof shortcomings, and to reward those who did well, refusing to pay any\r\nheed whatever in either case to anything except the man’s own character\r\nand record. A very few of these promotions and dismissals sufficed to\r\nshow our subordinates that at last they were dealing with superiors\r\nwho meant what they said, and that the days of political “pull” were\r\nover while we had the power. The effect was immediate. The decent men\r\ntook heart, and those who were not decent feared longer to offend. The\r\nmorale of the entire force improved steadily.\r\n\r\nA similar course was followed in reference to the relations between the\r\npolice and citizens generally. There had formerly been much complaint\r\nof the brutal treatment by police of innocent citizens. This was\r\nstopped peremptorily by the simple expedient of dismissing from the\r\nforce the first two or three men who were found guilty of brutality.\r\nOn the other hand we made the force understand that in the event of\r\nany emergency requiring them to use their weapons against either a mob\r\nor an individual criminal, the police board backed them up without\r\nreservation. Our sympathy was for the friends, and not the foes, of\r\norder. If a mob threatened violence we were glad to have the mob hurt.\r\nIf a criminal showed fight we expected the officer to use any weapon\r\nthat was necessary to overcome him on the instant; and even, if it\r\nbecame necessary, to take life. All that the board required was to\r\nbe convinced that the necessity really existed. We did not possess a\r\nparticle of that maudlin sympathy for the criminal, disorderly, and\r\nlawless classes which is such a particularly unhealthy sign of social\r\ndevelopment; and we were bound that the improvement in the fighting\r\nefficiency of the police should go hand in hand with the improvement in\r\ntheir moral tone.\r\n\r\nTo break up the system of blackmail and corruption was less easy. It\r\nwas not at all difficult to protect decent people in their rights, and\r\nthis was accomplished at once. But the criminal who is blackmailed has\r\na direct interest in paying the blackmailer, and it is not easy to get\r\ninformation about it. Nevertheless, we put a complete stop to most of\r\nthe blackmail by the simple process of rigorously enforcing the laws,\r\nnot only against crime, but against vice.\r\n\r\nIt was the enforcement of the liquor law which caused most excitement.\r\nIn New York we suffer from the altogether too common tendency to\r\nmake any law which a certain section of the community wants, and\r\nthen to allow that law to be more or less of a dead-letter if any\r\nother section of the community objects to it. The multiplication\r\nof laws by the Legislature, and their partial enforcement by the\r\nexecutive authorities, go hand in hand, and offer one of the many\r\nserious problems with which we are confronted in striving to better\r\ncivic conditions. New York State felt that liquor should not be\r\nsold on Sunday. The larger part of New York City wished to drink\r\nliquor on Sunday. Any man who studies the social condition of the\r\npoor knows that liquor works more ruin than any other one cause. He\r\nknows also, however, that it is simply impracticable to extirpate the\r\nhabit entirely, and that to attempt too much often merely results in\r\naccomplishing too little; and he knows, moreover, that for a man alone\r\nto drink whiskey in a bar-room is one thing, and for men with their\r\nfamilies to drink light wines or beer in respectable restaurants is\r\nquite a different thing. The average citizen, who doesn’t think at all,\r\nand the average politician of the baser sort, who only thinks about his\r\nown personal advantage, find it easiest to disregard these facts, and\r\nto pass a liquor law which will please the temperance people, and then\r\ntrust to the police department to enforce it with such laxity as to\r\nplease the intemperate.\r\n\r\nThe results of this pleasing system were evident in New York when\r\nour board came into power. The Sunday liquor law was by no means a\r\ndead letter in New York City. On the contrary no less than eight\r\nthousand arrests for its violation had been made under the Tammany\r\nregime the year before we came in. It was very much alive; but it was\r\nonly executed against those who either had no political pull, or who\r\nrefused to pay money. The liquor business does not stand on the same\r\nfooting with other occupations. It always tends to produce criminality\r\nin the population at large, and law-breaking among the saloonkeepers\r\nthemselves. It is absolutely necessary to supervise it rigidly, and\r\nimpose restrictions upon the traffic. In large cities the traffic\r\ncannot be stopped; but the evils can at least be minimized.\r\n\r\nIn New York the saloonkeepers have always stood high among professional\r\npoliticians. Nearly two thirds of the political leaders of Tammany\r\nHall have, at one time or another, been in the liquor business. The\r\nsaloon is the natural club and meeting place for the ward heelers and\r\nleaders, and the bar-room politician is one of the most common and best\r\nrecognized factors, in local political government. The saloonkeepers\r\nare always hand in glove with the professional politicians, and occupy\r\ntoward them a position such as is not held by any other class of men.\r\nThe influence they wield in local politics has always been very great,\r\nand until our board took office no man ever dared seriously to threaten\r\nthem for their flagrant violations of the law. The powerful and\r\ninfluential saloonkeeper was glad to see his neighbors closed, for it\r\ngave him business. On the other hand, a corrupt police captain, or the\r\ncorrupt politician who controlled him, could always extort money from\r\na saloonkeeper by threatening to close him and let his neighbor remain\r\nopen. Gradually the greed of corrupt police officials and of corrupt\r\npoliticians, grew by what it fed on, until they began to blackmail all\r\nbut the very most influential liquor sellers; and as liquor sellers\r\nwere very numerous, and the profits of the liquor business great, the\r\namount collected was enormous.\r\n\r\nThe reputable saloonkeepers themselves found this condition of\r\nblackmail and political favoritism almost intolerable. The law which\r\nwe found on the statute books had been put on by a Tammany Legislature\r\nthree years before we took office. A couple of months after we took\r\noffice, Mr. J. P. Smith, the editor of the liquor-dealers’ organ, _The\r\nWine and Spirit Gazette_, gave out the following interview, which is of\r\nsuch an extraordinary character that I insert it almost in full:\r\n\r\n“Governor Flower, as well as the Legislature of 1892, was elected\r\nupon distinct pledges that relief would be given by the Democratic\r\nparty to the liquor dealers, especially of the cities of the State.\r\nIn accordance with this promise a Sunday-opening clause was inserted\r\nin the excise bill of 1892. Governor Flower then said that he could\r\nnot approve the Sunday-opening clause; whereupon the Liquor Dealers’\r\nAssociation, which had charge of the bill, struck the Sunday-opening\r\nclause out. After Governor Hill had been elected for the second term\r\nI had several interviews with him on that very subject. He told me,\r\n‘You know I am the friend of the liquor dealers and will go to almost\r\nany length to help them and give them relief; but do not ask me to\r\nrecommend to the Legislature the passage of the law opening the\r\nsaloons on Sunday. I cannot do it, for it will ruin the Democratic\r\nparty in the State.’ He gave the same interview to various members of\r\nthe State Liquor Dealers’ Association, who waited upon him for the\r\npurpose of getting relief from the blackmail of the police, stating\r\nthat the lack of having the Sunday question properly regulated was at\r\nthe bottom of the trouble. Blackmail had been brought to such a state\r\nof perfection, and had become so oppressive to the liquor dealers\r\nthemselves, that they communicated first with Governor Hill and then\r\nwith Mr. Croker. The _Wine and Spirit Gazette_ had taken up the subject\r\nbecause of gross discrimination made by the police in the enforcement\r\nof the Sunday-closing law. The paper again and again called upon the\r\npolice commissioners to either uniformly enforce the law or uniformly\r\ndisregard it. A committee of the Central Association of Liquor\r\nDealers of this city then took up the matter and called upon Police\r\nCommissioner Martin.[15] _An agreement was then made between the\r\nleaders of Tammany Hall and the liquor dealers, according to which the\r\nmonthly blackmail paid to the police should be discontinued in return\r\nfor political support._[16] In other words, the retail dealers should\r\nbind themselves to solidly support the Tammany ticket in consideration\r\nof the discontinuance of the monthly blackmail by the police. This\r\nagreement was carried out. Now what was the consequence? If the liquor\r\ndealer, after the monthly blackmail ceased, showed any signs of\r\nindependence, the Tammany Hall district leader would give the tip to\r\nthe police captain, and that man would be pulled and arrested on the\r\nfollowing Sunday.”\r\n\r\nContinuing, Mr. Smith inveighed against the law, but said:\r\n\r\n“The (present) police commissioners are honestly endeavoring to have\r\nthe law impartially carried out. They are no respectors of persons. And\r\nour information from all classes of liquor-dealers is that the rich and\r\nthe poor, the influential and the uninfluential, are required equally\r\nto obey the law.”\r\n\r\nThere is really some difficulty in commenting upon the statements of\r\nthis interview, statements which were never denied.\r\n\r\nThe law was not in the least a dead-letter; it was enforced, but it\r\nwas corruptly and partially enforced. It was a prominent factor in\r\nthe Tammany scheme of government. It afforded a most effective means\r\nfor blackmailing a large portion of the liquor sellers and for the\r\nwholesale corruption of the police department. The high Tammany\r\nofficials and police captains and patrolmen blackmailed and bullied\r\nthe small liquor sellers without a pull, and turned them into abject\r\nslaves of Tammany Hall. On the other hand, the wealthy and politically\r\ninfluential liquor sellers controlled the police, and made or marred\r\ncaptains, sergeants, and patrolmen at their pleasure. In some of the\r\nprecincts most of the saloons were closed; in others almost all were\r\nopen. The rich and powerful liquor seller violated the law at will,\r\nunless he had fallen under the ban of the police or the ward boss, when\r\nhe was not allowed to violate it at all.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the new police board had one of two courses\r\nto follow. We could either instruct the police to allow all the\r\nsaloonkeepers to become law-breakers, or else we could instruct them\r\nto allow none to be law-breakers. We followed the latter course,\r\nbecause we had some regard for our oaths of office. For two or three\r\nmonths we had a regular fight, and on Sundays had to employ half the\r\nforce to enforce the liquor law; for the Tammany legislators had\r\ndrawn the law so as to make it easy of enforcement for purposes of\r\nblackmail, but not easy of enforcement generally, certain provisions\r\nbeing deliberately inserted with the intention to make it difficult of\r\nuniversal execution. However, when once the liquor sellers and their\r\nallies understood that we had not the slightest intention of being\r\nbullied, threatened or cajoled out of following the course which we had\r\nlaid down, resistance practically ceased. During the year after we\r\ntook office the number of arrests for violation of the Sunday liquor\r\nlaw sank to about one half of what they had been during the last year\r\nof the Tammany rule; and yet the saloons were practically closed,\r\nwhereas under Tammany most of them had been open. We adopted no new\r\nmethods, save in so far as honesty could be called a new method. We\r\ndid not enforce the law with unusual severity; we merely enforced it\r\nagainst the man with a pull, just as much as against the man without a\r\npull. We refused to discriminate in favor of influential law-breakers.\r\nThe professional politicians of low type, the liquor sellers, the\r\neditors of some German newspapers, and the sensational press generally,\r\nattacked us with a ferocity which really verged on insanity.\r\n\r\nWe went our way without regarding this opposition, and gave a very\r\nwholesome lesson to the effect that a law should not be put on the\r\nstatute books if it was not meant to be enforced, and that even an\r\nexcise law could be honestly enforced in New York if the public\r\nofficials so desired. The rich brewers and liquor sellers, who had\r\nmade money hand over fist by violating the excise law with the\r\ncorrupt connivance of the police, raved with anger, and every corrupt\r\npolitician and newspaper in the city gave them clamorous assistance;\r\nbut the poor man, and notably the poor man’s wife and children,\r\nbenefited very greatly by what we did. The hospital surgeons found that\r\ntheir Monday labors were lessened by nearly one half, owing to the\r\nstartling diminution in cases of injury due to drunken brawls; the work\r\nof the magistrates who sat in the city courts on Monday for the trial\r\nof the offenders of the preceding twenty-four hours was correspondingly\r\ndecreased; while many a tenement-house family spent Sunday in the\r\ncountry because for the first time the head of the family could not use\r\nup his money in getting drunk. The one all-important element in good\r\ncitizenship in our country is obedience to law, and nothing is more\r\nneeded than the resolute enforcement of law. This we gave.\r\n\r\nThere was no species of mendacity to which our opponents did not resort\r\nin the effort to break us down in our purpose. For weeks they eagerly\r\nrepeated the tale that the saloons were as wide open as ever; but\r\nthey finally abandoned this when the counsel for the Liquor Dealers’\r\nAssociation admitted in open court, at the time when we secured the\r\nconviction of thirty of his clients and thereby brought the fight to\r\nan end, that over nine tenths of the liquor dealers had been rendered\r\nbankrupt because we had stopped that illegal trade which gave them\r\nthe best portion of their revenue. They then took the line that by\r\ndevoting our attention to enforcing the liquor law we permitted crime\r\nto increase. This, of course, offered a very congenial field for\r\nnewspapers like the _World_, which exploited it to the utmost; all the\r\nmore readily since the mere reiteration of the falsehood tended to\r\nencourage criminals, and so to make it not a falsehood. For a time the\r\ncry was not without influence, even with decent people, especially\r\nif they belonged to the class of the timid rich; but it simply wasn’t\r\ntrue, and so this bubble went down stream with the others. For six or\r\neight months the cry grew, first louder, then lower; and then it died\r\naway. A commentary upon its accuracy was furnished toward the end of\r\nour administration; for in February 1897, the Judge who addressed the\r\ngrand jury of the month was able to congratulate them upon the fact\r\nthat there was at that time less crime in New York relatively to the\r\npopulation than ever before; and this held true for our two years’\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIn re-organizing the force the Board had to make, and did make, more\r\npromotions, more appointments, and more dismissals than had ever before\r\nbeen made in the same length of time. We were so hampered by the law\r\nthat we were not able to dismiss many of the men whom we should have\r\ndismissed, but we did turn out 200 men--more than four times as many as\r\nhad ever been turned out in the same length of time before; all of them\r\nbeing dismissed after formal trial, and after having been given full\r\nopportunity to be heard in their own defence. We appointed about 1700\r\nmen all told--again more than four times as many as ever before; for we\r\nwere allowed a large increase of the police force by law. We made 130\r\npromotions; more than had been made in the six preceding years.\r\n\r\nAll this work was done in strictest accord with what we have grown\r\nto speak of as the principles of civil service reform. In making\r\ndismissals we paid heed merely to the man’s efficiency and past\r\nrecord, refusing to consider outside pressure; under the old regime\r\nno policeman with sufficient influence behind him was ever dismissed,\r\nno matter what his offence. In making promotions we took into account\r\nnot only the man’s general record, his faithfulness, industry and\r\nvigilance, but also his personal prowess as shown in any special feat\r\nof daring, whether in the arresting of criminals or in the saving of\r\nlife--for the police service is military in character, and we wished to\r\nencourage the military virtues. In making appointments we found that it\r\nwas practicable to employ a system of rigid competitive examinations,\r\nwhich, as finally perfected, combined a very severe physical\r\nexamination with a mental examination such as could be passed by any\r\nman who had attended one of our public schools. Of course there was\r\nalso a rigid investigation of character. Theorists have often sneered\r\nat civil service reform as “impracticable;” and I am very far from\r\nasserting that written competitive examinations are always applicable,\r\nor that they may not sometimes be merely stop-gaps, used only because\r\nthey are better than the methods of appointing through political\r\nendorsement; but most certainly the system worked admirably in the\r\nPolice Department. We got the best lot of recruits for patrolmen that\r\nhad ever been obtained in the history of the force, and we did just as\r\nwell in our examinations for matrons and police surgeons. The uplifting\r\nof the force was very noticeable, both physically and mentally. The\r\nbest men we got were those who had served for three years or so in\r\nthe Army or Navy. Next to these came the railroad men. One noticeable\r\nfeature of the work was that we greatly raised the proportion of\r\nnative-born, until, of the last hundred appointed, ninety-four per\r\ncent. were Americans by birth. Not once in a hundred times did we know\r\nthe politics of the appointee, and we paid as little heed to this as to\r\ntheir religion.\r\n\r\nAnother of our important tasks was seeing that the elections were\r\ncarried on honestly. Under the old Tammany rule the cheating was\r\ngross and flagrant, and the police were often deliberately used to\r\nfacilitate fraudulent practices at the polls. This came about in part\r\nfrom the very low character of the men put in as election officers.\r\nBy conducting a written examination of the latter, and supplementing\r\nthis by a careful inquiry into their character, in which we invited any\r\ndecent outsiders to assist, we very distinctly raised their calibre.\r\nTo show how necessary our examinations were, I may mention that before\r\neach election held under us we were obliged to reject, for moral or\r\nmental shortcomings, over a thousand of the men whom the regular party\r\norganizations, exercising their legal rights, proposed as election\r\nofficers. We then merely had to make the police thoroughly understand\r\nthat their sole duty was to guarantee an honest election, and that they\r\nwould be punished with the utmost rigor if they interfered with honest\r\ncitizens on the one hand, or failed to prevent fraud and violence on\r\nthe other. The result was that the elections of 1895 and 1896 were by\r\nfar the most honest and orderly ever held in New York City.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of other ways in which we sought to reform the\r\npolice force, less important, and nevertheless very important. We\r\npaid particular heed to putting a premium on specially meritorious\r\nconduct, by awarding certificates of honorable mention, and medals,\r\nwhere we were unable to promote. We introduced a system of pistol\r\npractice by which, for the first time, the policemen were brought to\r\na reasonable standard of efficiency in handling their revolvers. The\r\nBertillion system for the identification of criminals was introduced.\r\nA bicycle squad was organized with remarkable results, this squad\r\nspeedily becoming a kind of _corps d’elite_, whose individual members\r\ndistinguished themselves not only by their devotion to duty, but by\r\nrepeated exhibitions of remarkable daring and skill. One important\r\nbit of reform was abolishing the tramp lodging-houses, which had\r\noriginally been started in the police stations, in a spirit of\r\nunwise philanthropy. These tramp lodging-houses, not being properly\r\nsupervised, were mere nurseries for pauperism and crime, tramps and\r\nloafers of every shade thronging to the city every winter to enjoy\r\ntheir benefits. We abolished them, a municipal lodging-house being\r\nsubstituted. Here all homeless wanderers were received, forced to\r\nbathe, given night-clothes before going to bed, and made to work next\r\nmorning, and in addition they were so closely supervised that habitual\r\ntramps and vagrants were speedily detected and apprehended.\r\n\r\nThere was a striking increase in the honesty of the force, and there\r\nwas a like increase in its efficiency. When we took office it is not\r\ntoo much to say that the great majority of the citizens of New York\r\nwere firmly convinced that no police force could be both honest and\r\nefficient. They felt it to be part of the necessary order of things\r\nthat a policeman should be corrupt, and they were convinced that the\r\nmost efficient way of warring against certain forms of crime--notably\r\ncrimes against person and property--was by enlisting the service of\r\nother criminals, and of purveyors of vice generally, giving them\r\nimmunity in return for their aid. Before we took power the ordinary\r\npurveyor of vice was allowed to ply his or her trade unmolested,\r\npartly in consideration of paying blackmail to the police, partly in\r\nconsideration of giving information about any criminal who belonged\r\nto the unprotected classes. We at once broke up this whole business\r\nof blackmail and protection, and made war upon all criminals alike,\r\ninstead of getting the assistance of half in warring on the other\r\nhalf. Nevertheless, so great was the improvement in the spirit of the\r\nforce, that, although deprived of their former vicious allies, they\r\nactually did better work than ever before against those criminals who\r\nthreatened life and property. Relatively to the population, fewer\r\ncrimes of violence occurred during our administration of the Board than\r\nin any previous two years of the city’s history in recent times; and\r\nthe total number of arrests of criminals increased, while the number of\r\ncases in which no arrest followed the commission of crime decreased.\r\nThe detective bureau nearly doubled the number of arrests made\r\ncompared with the year before we took office; obtaining, moreover, 365\r\nconvictions of felons and 215 convictions for misdemeanors, as against\r\n269 and 105 respectively for the previous year. At the same time every\r\nattempt at riot or disorder was summarily checked, and all gangs of\r\nviolent criminals brought into immediate subjection; while on the other\r\nhand the immense mass meetings and political parades were handled with\r\nsuch care that not a single case of clubbing of any innocent citizen\r\nwas reported.\r\n\r\nThe result of our labors was of value to the city, for we gave the\r\ncitizens better protection than they had ever before received, and\r\nat the same time cut out the corruption which was eating away civic\r\nmorality. We showed conclusively that it was possible to combine both\r\nhonesty and efficiency in handling the police. We were attacked with\r\nthe most bitter animosity by every sensational newspaper and every\r\npolitician of the baser sort, not because of our shortcomings, but\r\nbecause of what we did that was good. We enforced the laws as they were\r\non the statute books, we broke up blackmail, we kept down the spirit of\r\ndisorder, and repressed rascality, and we administered the force with\r\nan eye single to the welfare of the city. In doing this we encountered,\r\nas we had expected, the venemous opposition of all men whose interest\r\nit was that corruption should continue, or who were of such dull\r\nmorality that they were not willing to see honesty triumph at the cost\r\nof strife.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] _Atlantic Monthly_, September, 1897.\r\n\r\n[15] My predecessor in the Presidency of the Police Board.\r\n\r\n[16] The italics are my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX\r\n\r\n           THE VICE-PRESIDENCY AND THE CAMPAIGN OF 1896[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President is an officer unique in his character and functions,\r\nor to speak more properly, in his want of functions while he remains\r\nVice-President, and in his possibility of at any moment ceasing to be a\r\nfunctionless official and becoming the head of the whole nation. There\r\nis no corresponding position in any constitutional government. Perhaps\r\nthe nearest analogue is the heir apparent in a monarchy. Neither the\r\nFrench President nor the British Prime Minister has a substitute, ready\r\nat any moment to take his place, but exercising scarcely any authority\r\nuntil his place is taken. The history of such an office is interesting,\r\nand the personality of the incumbent for the time being may at any\r\nmoment become of vast importance.\r\n\r\nThe founders of our government--the men who did far more than draw\r\nup the Declaration of Independence, for they put forth the National\r\nConstitution--in many respects builded very wisely of set purpose. In\r\nsome cases they built wiser than they knew. In yet other instances\r\nthey failed entirely to achieve objects for which they had endeavored\r\nto provide by a most elaborate and ingenious governmental arrangement.\r\nThey distrusted what would now be called pure Democracy, and they\r\ndreaded what we would now call party government.\r\n\r\nTheir distrust of Democracy induced them to construct the electoral\r\ncollege for the choice of a President, the original idea being that\r\nthe people should elect their best and wisest men who in turn should,\r\nuntrammeled by outside pressure, elect a President. As a matter of fact\r\nthe functions of the electorate have now by time and custom become of\r\nlittle more importance than those of so many letter-carriers. They\r\ndeliver the electoral votes of their states just as a letter-carrier\r\ndelivers his mail. But in the presidential contest this year it may be\r\nwe shall see a partial return to the ideals of the men of 1789; for\r\nsome of the electors on the Bryan-Sewall-Watson ticket may exercise a\r\nchoice between the vice-presidential candidates.\r\n\r\nThe distrust felt by the founders of the constitution for party\r\ngovernment took shape in the scheme to provide that the majority party\r\nshould have the foremost place, and the minority party the second\r\nplace, in the national executive. The man who received the greatest\r\nnumber of electoral votes was made President, and the man who received\r\nthe second greatest number was made Vice-President, on a theory\r\nsomewhat akin to that by which certain reformers hope to revolutionize\r\nour system of voting at the present day. In the early days under the\r\npresent constitution this system resulted in the choice of Adams\r\nfor President and of his anti-type Jefferson as Vice-President, the\r\ncombination being about as incongruous as if we should now see McKinley\r\nPresident and either Bryan or Watson Vice-President. Even in theory\r\nsuch an arrangement is very bad, because under it the Vice-President\r\nmight readily be, and as a matter of fact was, a man utterly opposed\r\nto all the principles to which the President was devoted, so that\r\nthe arrangement provided in the event of the death of the President,\r\nnot for a succession, but for a revolution. The system was very\r\nsoon dropped, and each party nominated its own candidates for both\r\npositions. But it was many years before all the members of the\r\nelectoral college of one party felt obliged to cast the same votes for\r\nboth President and Vice-President, and consequently there was a good\r\ndeal of scrambling and shifting in taking the vote. When, however,\r\nthe parties had crystallized into Democratic and Whig, a score of\r\nyears after the disappearance of the Federalists, the system of party\r\nvoting also crystallized. Each party then as a rule nominated one\r\nman for President and one for Vice-President, these being voted for\r\nthroughout the nation. This system in turn speedily produced strange\r\nresults, some of which remain to this day. There are and must be in\r\nevery party factions. The victorious faction may crush out and destroy\r\nthe others, or it may try to propitiate at least its most formidable\r\nrival. In consequence, the custom grew of offering the vice-presidency\r\nas a consolation prize, to be given in many cases to the very men\r\nwho were most bitterly opposed to the nomination of the successful\r\ncandidate for President. Sometimes this consolation prize was awarded\r\nfor geographical reasons, sometimes to bring into the party men who on\r\npoints of principle might split away because of the principles of the\r\npresidential candidate himself, and at other times it was awarded for\r\nmerely factional reasons to some faction which did not differ in the\r\nleast from the dominant faction in matters of principles, but had very\r\ndecided views on the question of offices.\r\n\r\nThe presidency being all important, and the vice-presidency of\r\ncomparatively little note, the entire strength of the contending\r\nfactions is spent in the conflict over the first, and very often a man\r\nwho is most anxious to take the first place will not take the second,\r\npreferring some other political position. It has thus frequently\r\nhappened that the two candidates have been totally dissimilar in\r\ncharacter and even in party principle, though both running on the same\r\nticket. Very odd results have followed in more than one instance.\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of the evils sometimes springing from this\r\nsystem is afforded by what befell the Whigs after the election and\r\ndeath of the elder Harrison. Translated into the terms of the politics\r\nof continental Europe of to-day, Harrison’s adherents represented\r\na union between the right and the extreme left against the centre.\r\nThat is, the regular Whigs who formed the bulk of his supporters were\r\nsupplemented by a small body of extremists who in their political\r\nprinciples were even more alien to the Whigs than were the bulk of the\r\nregular Democrats, but who themselves hated these regular Democrats\r\nwith the peculiar ferocity so often felt by the extremist for the man\r\nwho goes far, but not quite far enough. In consequence, the President\r\nrepresented Whig principles, the Vice-President represented a rather\r\nextreme form of the very principles to which the Whigs were most\r\nopposed. The result was that when Harrison died the presidency fell\r\ninto the hands of a man who had but a corporal’s guard of supporters in\r\nthe nation, and who proceeded to oppose all the measures of the immense\r\nmajority of those who elected him.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar instance was afforded in the case of Lincoln and\r\nJohnson. Johnson was put on the ticket largely for geographical\r\nreasons, and on the death of Lincoln he tried to reverse the policy\r\nof the party which had put him in office. An instance of an entirely\r\ndifferent kind is afforded by Garfield and Arthur. The differences\r\nbetween these two party leaders were mainly merely factional. Each\r\nstood squarely on the platform of the party, and all the principles\r\nadvocated by one were advocated by the other; yet the death of Garfield\r\nmeant a complete overturn in the _personnel_ of the upper Republican\r\nofficials, because Arthur had been nominated expressly to placate the\r\ngroup of party leaders who most objected to the nomination of Garfield.\r\nArthur made a very good President, but the bitterness caused by his\r\nsuccession to power nearly tore the party in twain. It will be noted\r\nthat most of these evils arose from the fact that the Vice-President\r\nunder ordinary circumstances possesses so little real power. He\r\npresides over the Senate and he has in Washington a position of marked\r\nsocial importance, but his political weight as Vice-President is almost\r\n_nil_. There is always a chance that he may become President. As this\r\nis only a chance it seems quite impossible to persuade politicians\r\nto give it proper weight. This certainly does not seem right. The\r\nVice-President should, so far as possible, represent the same views\r\nand principles which have secured the nomination and election of the\r\nPresident, and he should be a man standing well in the councils of the\r\nparty, trusted by his fellow party leaders, and able in the event of\r\nany accident to his chief to take up the work of the latter just where\r\nit was left. The Republican party has this year nominated such a man\r\nin the person of Mr. Hobart. But nominations of this kind have by no\r\nmeans always been the rule of recent years. No change of parties, for\r\ninstance, could well produce a greater revolution in policy than would\r\nhave been produced at almost any time during the last three years if\r\nMr. Cleveland had died and Mr. Stevenson had succeeded him.\r\n\r\nOne sure way to secure this desired result would undoubtedly be to\r\nincrease the power of the Vice-President. He should always be a man\r\nwho would be consulted by the President on every great party question.\r\nIt would be very well if he were given a seat in the Cabinet. It might\r\nbe well if, in addition to his vote in the Senate in the event of a\r\ntie, he should be given a vote, on ordinary occasions, and perchance on\r\noccasions a voice in the debates. A man of the character of Mr. Hobart\r\nis sure to make his weight felt in an administration, but the power of\r\nthus exercising influence should be made official rather than personal.\r\n\r\nThe present contest offers a striking illustration of the way in which\r\nthe Vice-President ought and ought not to be nominated, and to study\r\nthis it is necessary to study not only the way in which the different\r\ncandidates were nominated, but at least in outline the characters of\r\nthe candidates themselves.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in many years, indeed for the first time since\r\nparties have fairly crystallized along their present lines, there are\r\nthree parties running, two of which support the same presidential\r\ncandidate but different candidates for the vice-presidency. Each one of\r\nthese parties has carried several states during the last three or four\r\nyears. Each party has a right to count upon a number of electoral votes\r\nas its own. Closely though the Democratic and Populistic parties have\r\nnow approximated in their principles as enunciated in the platforms\r\nof Chicago and St. Louis, they yet do differ on certain points, and\r\nneither would have any chance of beating the Republicans without the\r\nhelp of the other. The result has been a coalition, yet each party to\r\nthe coalition has retained enough of its jealous individuality to make\r\nit refuse to accept the candidate of the other for the second position\r\non the ticket.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party stands on a normal and healthy party footing. It\r\nhas enunciated a definite set of principles entirely in accord with\r\nits past actions. It has nominated on this platform a President and\r\nVice-President, both of whom are thorough-going believers in all the\r\nparty principles set forth in the platform upon which they stand. Mr.\r\nMcKinley believes in sound finance,--that is, in a currency based upon\r\ngold and as good as gold. So does Mr. Hobart. Mr. McKinley believes in\r\na protective tariff. So does Mr. Hobart. Mr. McKinley believes in the\r\nonly method of preserving orderly liberty,--that is, in seeing that the\r\nlaws are enforced at whatever cost. So does Mr. Hobart. In short, Mr.\r\nHobart stands for precisely the same principles that are represented\r\nby Mr. McKinley. He is a man of weight in the community, who has had\r\nwide experience both in business and in politics. He is taking an\r\nactive part in the campaign, and he will be a power if elected to\r\nthe vice-presidency. All the elements which have rallied behind Mr.\r\nMcKinley are just as heartily behind Mr. Hobart. The two represent the\r\nsame forces, and they stand for a party with a coherent organization\r\nand a definite purpose, to the carrying out of which they are equally\r\npledged.\r\n\r\nIt will be a matter of much importance to the nation that the next\r\nVice-President should stand for some settled policy. It is an\r\nunhealthy thing to have the Vice-President and President represented\r\nby principles so far apart that the succession of one to the place of\r\nthe other means a change as radical as any possible party overturn. The\r\nstraining and dislocation of our governmental institutions was very\r\ngreat when Tyler succeeded Harrison and Johnson succeeded Lincoln.\r\nIn each case the majority of the party that had won the victory felt\r\nthat it had been treated with scandalous treachery, for Tyler grew\r\nto be as repulsive to the Whigs as Polk himself, and the Republicans\r\ncould scarcely have hated Seymour more than they hated Johnson. The\r\nVice-President has a three-fold relation. First to the administration;\r\nnext as presiding officer in the Senate, where he should be a man of\r\ndignity and force; and third in his social position, for socially he\r\nranks second to the President alone. Mr. Morton was in every way an\r\nadmirable Vice-President under General Harrison, and had he succeeded\r\nto the presidential chair there would have been no break in the great\r\npolicies which were being pushed forward by the administration. But\r\nduring Mr. Cleveland’s two incumbencies Messrs. Hendricks and Stevenson\r\nhave represented, not merely hostile factions, but principles and\r\ninterests from which he was sundered by a gulf quite as great as that\r\nwhich divided him from his normal party foes. Mr. Sewall would make a\r\ncolorless Vice-President, and were he at any time to succeed Mr. Bryan\r\nin the White House would travel Mr. Bryan’s path only with extreme\r\nreluctance and under duress. Mr. Watson would be a more startling, more\r\nattractive, and more dangerous figure, for if he got the chance he\r\nwould lash the nation with a whip of scorpions, while Mr. Bryan would\r\nbe content with the torture of ordinary thongs.\r\n\r\nFinally, Mr. Hobart would typify as strongly as Mr. McKinley himself\r\nwhat was best in the Republican party and in the nation, and would\r\nstand as one of the known champions of his party on the very questions\r\nat issue in the present election. He is a man whose advice would be\r\nsought by all who are prominent in the administration. In short, he\r\nwould be the kind of man whom the electors are certain to choose as\r\nVice-President if they exercise their choice rationally.\r\n\r\nThe men who left the Republican party because of the nomination\r\nof McKinley would have left it just as quickly if Hobart had been\r\nnominated. They do not believe in sound finance, and though many of\r\nthe bolters object to anarchy and favor protection, they feel that in\r\nthis crisis their personal desires must be repressed and that they are\r\nconscientiously bound to support the depreciated dollar even at the\r\ncost of incidentally supporting the principles of a low tariff and\r\nthe doctrine that a mob should be allowed to do what it likes with\r\nimmunity. There are many advocates of clipped or depreciated money\r\nwho are rather sorry to see the demand for such currency coupled with\r\na demand for more lawlessness and an abandonment by the government\r\nof the police functions which are the essential attributes of\r\ncivilization; but they have overcome their reluctance, feeling that on\r\nthe whole it is more important that the money of the nation should be\r\nunsound than that its laws should be obeyed. People who feel this way\r\nare just as much opposed to Mr. Hobart as to Mr. McKinley. They object\r\nto the platform upon which the two men stand, and they object as much\r\nto the character of one man as to the character of the other. They are\r\nrepelled by McKinley’s allegiance to the cause of sound money, and find\r\nnothing to propitiate them in Hobart’s uncompromisingly honest attitude\r\non the same question. There is no reason whatever why any voter who\r\nwould wish to vote against the one should favor the other, or _vice\r\nversa_.\r\n\r\nWhen we cross the political line all this is changed. On the leading\r\nissue of the campaign the entire triangle of candidates are a unit.\r\nMr. Bryan, the nominee for the presidency, and Messrs. Sewall and\r\nWatson, the nominees for the vice-presidency, are almost equally\r\ndevoted adherents of the light-weight dollar and of a currency which\r\nshall not force a man to repay what he has borrowed, and shall punish\r\nthe wrong-headed laborer, who expects to be paid his wages in money\r\nworth something, as heavily as the business man or farmer who is so\r\nimmoral as to wish to pay his debts. All three are believers in that\r\nold-world school of finance which appears under such protean changes\r\nof policy, always desiring the increase of the circulating medium, but\r\ndiffering as to the means, which in one age takes the form of putting\r\nbase metal in with the good, or of clipping the good, and in another\r\nassumes the guise of fiat money, or the free coinage of silver. On\r\nthis currency question they are substantially alike, agreeing (as one\r\nof their adherents picturesquely put it, in arguing in favor of that\r\nform of abundant currency which has as its highest exponent the money\r\nof the late Confederacy) that “the money which was good enough for the\r\nsoldiers of Washington is good enough for us.” As a matter of fact the\r\nsoldiers of Washington were not at all grateful for the money which the\r\nloud-mouthed predecessors of Mr. Bryan and his kind then thought “good\r\nenough” for them. The money with which the veterans of Washington were\r\npaid was worth two cents on the dollar, and as yet neither Mr. Bryan,\r\nMr. Sewall, nor Mr. Watson has advocated a two-cent copper dollar.\r\nStill, they are striving toward this ideal, and in their advocacy of\r\nthe fifty cent dollar they are one.\r\n\r\nBut beyond this they begin to differ. Mr. Sewall distinctly sags behind\r\nthe leader of the spike team, Mr. Bryan, and still more distinctly\r\nbehind his rival, or running mate, or whatever one may choose to call\r\nhim, the Hon. Thomas Watson. There is far more regard for the essential\r\nfitness of things in a ticket which contains Mr. Bryan and Mr. Watson\r\nthan one which contains Mr. Bryan and Mr. Sewall. Mr. Watson is a\r\nman of Mr. Bryan’s type, only a little more so. But Mr. Sewall is\r\nof a different type, and possesses many attributes which must make\r\nassociation with him exceedingly painful, not merely to Mr. Watson,\r\nbut to Mr. Bryan himself. He is a well-to-do man. Indeed in many\r\ncommunities he would be called a rich man. He is a banker, a railroad\r\nman, a shipbuilder, and has been successful in business. Now if Mr.\r\nBryan and Mr. Watson really stand for any principle it is hostility\r\nto this kind of success. Thrift, industry, and business energy are\r\nqualities which are quite incompatible with true Populistic feeling.\r\nPayment of debts, like the suppression of riots, is abhorrent to the\r\nPopulistic mind. Such conduct strikes the Populist as immoral. Mr.\r\nBryan made his appearance in Congress with two colleagues elected on\r\nthe same ticket, one of whom stated to the present writer that no\r\nhonest man ever earned $5000 a year; that whoever got that amount stole\r\nit. Mr. Sewall has earned many times $5000 a year. He is a prosperous\r\ncapitalist. Populism never prospers save where men are unprosperous,\r\nand your true Populist is especially intolerant of business success. If\r\na man is a successful business man he at once calls him a plutocrat.\r\n\r\nHe makes only one exception. A miner or speculator in mines may be many\r\ntimes a millionaire and yet remain in good standing in the Populist\r\nparty. The Populist has ineradicably fixed in his mind the belief that\r\nsilver is a cheap metal, and that silver money is, while not fiat\r\nmoney, still a long step toward it. Silver is connected in his mind\r\nwith scaling down debts, the partial repudiation of obligations,\r\nand other measures aimed at those odious moneyed tyrants who lend\r\nmoney to persons who insist upon borrowing, or who have put their\r\nill-gotten gains in saving banks and kindred wicked institutions for\r\nthe encouragement of the vice of thrift. These pleasurable associations\r\nquite outweigh, with the Populist, the fact that the silver man himself\r\nis rich. He is even for the moment blind to the further fact that these\r\npro-silver men, like Senator Stewart, Governor Altgeld, and their\r\ncompeers, strenuously insist that the obligations to themselves shall\r\nbe liquidated in gold; indeed this particular idiosyncrasy of the\r\nsilver leaders is not much frowned upon by the bulk of the Populists,\r\nbecause it has at least the merit of savoring strongly of “doing”\r\none’s creditors. Not even the fact that rich silver mine owners may\r\nhave earned their money honestly can outweigh the other fact that they\r\nchampion a species of currency which will make most thrifty and honest\r\nmen poorer, in the minds of the truly logical Populist.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Sewall has no fictitious advantage in the way of owing his\r\nwealth to silver. He has made his money precisely as the most loathed\r\nreprobate of Wall Street--or of New York, which the average Populist\r\nregards as synonymous with Wall Street--has made his. The average\r\nPopulist does not draw fine distinctions. There are in New York, as\r\nin other large cities, scoundrels of great wealth who have made their\r\nmoney by means skilfully calculated to come just outside the line of\r\ncriminality. There are other men who have made their money exactly as\r\nthe successful miner or farmer makes his,--that is, by the exercise\r\nof shrewdness, business daring, energy and thrift. But the Populist\r\ndraws no line of division between these two classes. They have made\r\nmoney, and that is enough. One may have built railroads and the other\r\nhave wrecked them, but they are both railroad men in his eyes, and\r\nthat is all. One may have swindled his creditors, and the other built\r\nup a bank which has been of incalculable benefit to all who have had\r\ndealings with it, but to the Populist they are both gold bugs, and as\r\nsuch noxious. Mr. Sewall is the type of man the contemplation of which\r\nusually throws a Populist orator into spasms. But it happens that he\r\nbelieves in free silver, just as other very respectable men believe\r\nin spirit rapping, or the faith-cure, or Buddhism, or pilgrimages to\r\nLourdes, or the foot of a graveyard rabbit. There are very able men and\r\nvery lovely women who believe in each or all of these, and there are a\r\nmuch larger number who believe in free silver. Had they lived in the\r\ndays of Sparta they would have believed in free iron, iron coin being\r\nat that time the cheapest circulating medium, the adoption of which\r\nwould give the greatest expansion of the currency. But they have been\r\ndragged on by the slow procession of the centuries, and now they only\r\nbelieve in free silver. It is a belief which is compatible with all the\r\ndomestic virtues, and even occasionally with very good capacities as a\r\npublic servant. Mr. Sewall doubtless stands as one of these men. He can\r\nhardly be happy, planted firmly as he is, on the Chicago platform. In\r\nthe minds of most thrifty, hard-working men, who are given to thinking\r\nat all about public questions, the free-silver plank is very far from\r\nbeing the most rotten of the many rotten planks put together with such\r\nperverted skill by the Chicago architects. A platform which declares in\r\nfavor of free and unlimited rioting and which has the same strenuous\r\nobjection to the exercise of the police power by the general government\r\nthat is felt in the circles presided over by Herr Most, Eugene V. Debs,\r\nand all the people whose pictures appear in the detective bureaus of\r\nour great cities, cannot appeal to persons who have gone beyond the\r\nunpolished-stone period of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe men who object to what they style “government by injunction”\r\nare, as regards the essential principles of government, in hearty\r\nsympathy with their remote skin-clad ancestors who lived in caves,\r\nfought one another with stone-headed axes, and ate the mammoth and\r\nwoolly rhinoceros. They are interesting as representing a geological\r\nsurvival, but they are dangerous whenever there is the least chance of\r\ntheir making the principles of this ages-buried past living factors\r\nin our present life. They are not in sympathy with men of good minds\r\nand sound civic morality. It is not a nice thing to wish to pay one’s\r\ndebts in coins worth fifty cents on the dollar, but it is a much less\r\nnice thing to wish to plunge one’s country into anarchy by providing\r\nthat the law shall only protect the lawless and frown scornfully on the\r\nlaw-abiding. There is a good deal of mushy sentiment in the world, and\r\nthere are always a certain number of people whose minds are weak and\r\nwhose emotions are strong and who effervesce with sympathy toward any\r\nman who does wrong, and with indignation against any man who chastises\r\nthe criminal for having done wrong. These emotionalists, moreover, are\r\nalways reinforced by that large body of men who themselves wish to\r\ndo wrong, and who are not sentimental at all, but, on the contrary,\r\nvery practical. It is rarely that these two classes control a great\r\npolitical party, but at Chicago this became an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Chicago convention attacked the Supreme Court. Again\r\nthis represents a species of atavism,--that is, of recurrence to the\r\nways of thought of remote barbarian ancestors. Savages do not like\r\nan independent and upright judiciary. They want the judge to decide\r\ntheir way, and if he does not, they want to behead him. The Populists\r\nexperience much the same emotions when they realize that the judiciary\r\nstands between them and plunder.\r\n\r\nNow on all these points Mr. Sewall can hardly feel complete sympathy\r\nwith his temporary allies. He is very anxious that the Populists shall\r\nvote for him for Vice-President, and of course he feels a kindly\r\nemotion toward those who do intend to vote for him. He would doubtless\r\npardon much heresy of political belief in any member of the electoral\r\ncollege who feels that Sewall is his friend, not Watson,--Codlin, not\r\nShort. He has, of course, a vein of the erratic in his character,\r\nor otherwise he would not be in such company at all, and would have\r\nno quality that would recommend him to them. But on the whole his\r\nsympathies must lie with the man who saves money rather than with the\r\nman who proposes to take away the money when it has been saved, and\r\nwith the policeman who arrests a violent criminal rather than with the\r\ncriminal. Such sympathy puts him at a disadvantage in the Populist\r\ncamp. He is loud in his professions of belief in the remarkable series\r\nof principles for which he is supposed to stand, but his protestations\r\nring rather hollow. The average supporter of Bryan doubtless intends\r\nto support Sewall, for he thinks him an unimportant tail to the Bryan\r\nkite. But, though unimportant, he regards him with a slight feeling of\r\nirritation, as being at the best a rather ludicrous contrast to the\r\nrest of the kite. He contributes no element of strength to the Bryan\r\nticket, for other men who work hard and wish to enjoy the fruits of\r\ntheir toil simply regard him as a renegade, and the average Populist,\r\nor Populistic Democrat, does not like him, and accepts him simply\r\nbecause he fears not doing so may jeopardize Bryan’s chances. He is\r\nin the uncomfortable position always held by the respectable theorist\r\nwho gets caught in a revolutionary movement and has to wedge nervously\r\nup into the front rank with the gentlemen who are not troubled by any\r\nof his scruples, and who really do think that it is all very fine and\r\nglorious. In fact Mr. Sewall is much the least picturesque and the\r\nleast appropriate figure on the platform or platforms upon which Mr.\r\nBryan is standing.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson, whose enemies now call him a Georgia cracker, is in reality\r\na far more suitable companion for Mr. Bryan in such a contest. It\r\nmust be said, however, that if virtue always received its reward Mr.\r\nWatson and not Mr. Bryan would stand at the head of the ticket. In\r\nthe language of mathematicians Mr. Watson merely represents Mr. Bryan\r\nraised several powers. The same is true of the Populist as compared\r\nto the Democratic platform. Mr. Bryan may affect to believe that free\r\nsilver does represent the ultimate goal, and that his friends do not\r\nintend to go further in the direction of fiat money. Mr. Watson’s\r\nfriends, the middle-of-the-road Populists, are much more fearless and\r\nmuch more logical. They are willing to accept silver as a temporary\r\nmakeshift, but they want a currency based on corn and cotton next, and\r\nultimately a currency based on the desires of the people who issue\r\nit. The statesmanlike utterance of that great financier, Mr. Bryan’s\r\nchief rival for the nomination and at present his foremost supporter,\r\nMr. Bland, to the effect that he would “wipe out the national debt as\r\nwith a sponge,” meets with their cordial approval as far as it goes,\r\nbut they object to the qualification before the word “debt.” In wiping\r\nout debts they do not wish to halt merely at the national debt. The\r\nPopulists indorsed Bryan as the best they could get; but they hated\r\nSewall so that they took the extraordinary step of nominating the\r\nVice-President before the President so as to make sure of a really\r\nacceptable man in the person of Watson.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Bryan denunciation of the gold bug and the banker is largely\r\na mere form of intellectual entertainment; but with Mr. Watson it\r\nrepresents an almost ferocious conviction. Someone has said that Mr.\r\nWatson like Mr. Tillman, is an embodied retribution on the South\r\nfor having failed to educate the cracker, the poor white who gives\r\nhim his strength. It would ill beseem any dweller in cities of the\r\nNorth, especially any dweller in the city of Tammany, to reproach\r\nthe South with having failed to educate anybody. But Mr. Watson is\r\ncertainly an awkward man for a community to develop. He is infinitely\r\nmore in earnest than is Mr. Bryan. Mr. Watson’s followers belong\r\nto that school of southern Populists who honestly believe that the\r\nrespectable and commonplace people who own banks, railroads, dry-goods\r\nstores, factories, and the like, are persons with many of the mental\r\nand social attributes that unpleasantly distinguished Heliogabalus,\r\nNero, Caligula, and other worthies of later Rome. Not only do they\r\nbelieve this, but they say it with appalling frankness. They are very\r\nsincere as a rule, or at least the rank and file are. They are also\r\nvery suspicious. They distrust anything they cannot understand; and as\r\nthey understand but little this opens a very wide field for distrust.\r\nThey are apt to be emotionally religious. If not, they are then at\r\nleast atheists of an archaic type. Refinement and comfort they are\r\napt to consider quite as objectionable as immorality. That a man\r\nshould change his clothes in the evening, that he should dine at any\r\nother hour than noon, impress these good people as being symptoms\r\nof depravity instead of merely trivial. A taste for learning and\r\ncultivated friends, and a tendency to bathe frequently, cause them the\r\ndeepest suspicion. A well-to-do man they regard with jealous distrust,\r\nand if they cannot be well-to-do themselves, at least they hope to make\r\nmatters uncomfortable for those that are. They possess many strong,\r\nrugged virtues, but they are quite impossible politically, because they\r\nalways confound the essentials and the non-essentials, and though they\r\noften make war on vice, they rather prefer making war upon prosperity\r\nand refinement.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson was in a sense born out of place when he was born in\r\nGeorgia, for in Georgia the regular Democracy, while it has accepted\r\nthe principles of the Populists, has made war on their _personnel_,\r\nand in every way strives to press them down. Far better for Mr. Watson\r\nwould it have been could he have been born in the adjacent State of\r\nSouth Carolina, where the Populists swallowed the Democrats with a\r\ngulp. Senator Tillman, the great Populist or Democratic orator from\r\nSouth Carolina, possesses an untrammelled tongue any middle-of-the-road\r\nman would envy: and moreover Mr. Tillman’s brother has been frequently\r\nelected to Congress upon the issue that he never wore either an\r\novercoat or an undershirt, an issue which any Populist statesman finds\r\nreadily comprehensible, and which he would recognize at first glance\r\nas being strong before the people. It needs a certain amount of mental\r\nsubtlety to appreciate that it is for one’s interest to support a man\r\nbecause he is honest and has broad views about coast defenses and the\r\nnavy, and other similar subjects; but it does not need any mind at all\r\nto have one’s prejudices stirred in favor of a statesman whose claim to\r\nthe title rests upon his indifference to the requirements of civilized\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nAltogether Mr. Watson, with his sincerity, his frankness, his extreme\r\nsuspiciousness, his distrust of anything he cannot understand, and\r\nthe feeling he encourages against all the elegancies and decencies of\r\ncivilized life, is an interesting personage. He represents the real\r\nthing, while Bryan after all is more or less a sham and a compromise.\r\nMr. Watson would, at a blow, destroy all banks and bankers, with a\r\ncheerful, albeit vague, belief that thereby he was in some abstruse way\r\nbenefiting the people at large. And he would do this with the simple\r\nsincerity and faith of an African savage who tries to benefit his tribe\r\nby a sufficiency of human sacrifices. But Mr. Bryan would be beset by\r\nugly doubts when he came to put into effect all the mischievous beliefs\r\nof his followers, and Mr. Sewall would doubtless be frankly miserable\r\nif it ever became necessary for him to take a lead in such matters. Mr.\r\nWatson really ought to be the first man on the ticket, with Mr. Bryan\r\nsecond; for he is much the superior in boldness, in thorough-going\r\nacceptance of his principles according to their logical conclusions,\r\nand in sincerity of faith. It is impossible not to regret that the\r\nDemocrats and Populists should not have put forward in the first place\r\nthe man who genuinely represents their ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is even doubtful whether Mr. Watson will receive the\r\nsupport to which he is entitled as a vice-presidential candidate. In\r\nthe South the Populists have been so crushed under the heel of the\r\nDemocrats, and have bitten that heel with such eager venom, that they\r\ndislike entering into a coalition with them; but in the south the\r\nDemocrats will generally control the election machinery. In the far\r\nWest, and generally in those States where the Populist wing of the new\r\nalliance is ascendant, the Populists have no especial hatred of the\r\nDemocrats. They know that their principles are substantially identical,\r\nand they think it best to support the man who seems to represent the\r\nmajority faction among the various factions that stand behind Bryan.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this curious condition of affairs there are several\r\ninteresting possibilities open. The electoral college consists of the\r\nmen elected at the polls in the various States to record the decrees\r\nof the majorities in those States, and it has grown to be an axiom\r\nof politics that they must merely register the will of the men who\r\nelected them. But it does seem possible that in the present election\r\nsome of the electors may return to the old principles of a century ago\r\nand exercise at least a limited discretion in casting their votes. In\r\na State like Nebraska, for instance, it looks as though it would be\r\npossible that the electoral ticket on the anti-Republican side would be\r\ncomposed of four Bryan and Watson men and four Bryan and Sewall men.\r\nNow in the event of Bryan having more votes than McKinley--that is,\r\nin the event of the country showing strong Bedlamite tendencies next\r\nNovember--it might be that a split between Sewall and Watson would give\r\na plurality to Hobart, and in such event it is hardly conceivable that\r\nsome of the electors would not exercise their discretion by changing\r\ntheir votes. If they did not, we might then again see a return to the\r\nearly and profoundly interesting practice of our fathers and witness a\r\nPresident chosen by one party and a Vice-President by the other.\r\n\r\nI wish it to be distinctly understood, however, that these are merely\r\ninteresting speculations as to what might occur in a hopelessly\r\nimprobable contingency. I am a good American, with a profound belief\r\nin my countrymen, and I have no idea that they will deliberately\r\nlower themselves to a level beneath that of a South American\r\nRepublic, by voting for the farrago of sinister nonsense which the\r\nPopulistic-Democratic politicians at Chicago chose to set up as\r\nembodying the principles of their party, and for the amiable and\r\nwindy demagogue who stands upon that platform. Many entirely honest\r\nand intelligent men have been misled by the silver talk, and have\r\nfor the moment joined the ranks of the ignorant, the vicious and the\r\nwrong-headed. These men of character and capacity are blinded by their\r\nown misfortunes, or their own needs, or else they have never fairly\r\nlooked into the matter for themselves, being, like most men, whether in\r\n“gold” or “silver” communities, content to follow the opinion of those\r\nthey are accustomed to trust. After full and fair inquiry these men, I\r\nam sure, whether they live in Maine, in Tennessee, or in Oregon, will\r\ncome out on the side of honest money. The shiftless and vicious and\r\nthe honest but hopelessly ignorant and puzzle-headed voters cannot be\r\nreached; but the average farmer, the average business man, the average\r\nworkman--in short, the average American--will always stand up for\r\nhonesty and decency when he can once satisfy himself as to the side on\r\nwhich they are to be found.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] _Review of Reviews_, September, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n                HOW NOT TO HELP OUR POORER BROTHER[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of my article in the September _Review of\r\nReviews_ on the vice-presidential candidates, I received the following\r\nvery manly, and very courteous, letter from the Honorable Thomas\r\nWatson, then the candidate with Mr. Bryan on the Populist ticket for\r\nVice-President. I publish it with his permission:\r\n\r\n  HON. THEODORE ROOSEVELT:\r\n\r\n It pains me to be misunderstood by those whose good opinion I respect,\r\n and upon reading your trenchant article in the September number of the\r\n _Review of Reviews_ the impulse was strong to write to you.\r\n\r\n When you take your stand for honester government and for juster laws\r\n in New York, as you have so courageously done, your motives must be\r\n the same as mine--for you do not need the money your office gives\r\n you. I can understand, instinctively, what you feel--what your motives\r\n are. You merely obey a law of your nature which puts you into mortal\r\n combat with what you think is wrong. You fight because your own sense\r\n of self-respect and self-loyalty compels you to fight. Is not this so?\r\n\r\n If in Georgia and throughout the South we have conditions as\r\n intolerable as those that surround you in New York, can you not\r\n realize why I make war upon them?\r\n\r\n Tammany itself has grown great because mistaken leaders of the\r\n southern Democracy catered to its Kellys and Crokers and feared to\r\n defy them.\r\n\r\n The first “roast” I ever got from the Democratic press of this State\r\n followed a speech I had made denouncing Tammany, and denouncing the\r\n craven leaders who obeyed Tammany.\r\n\r\n It is astonishing how one honest man may honestly misjudge another.\r\n\r\n My creed does _not_ lead me to dislike the men who run a bank, a\r\n factory, a railroad or a foundry. I do _not_ hate a man for owning a\r\n bond, and having a bank account, or having cash loaned at interest.\r\n\r\n Upon the other hand, I think each should make all the profit in\r\n business he fairly can; but I do believe that the banks should not\r\n exercise the sovereign power of issuing money, and I do believe that\r\n all special privileges granted, and all exemption from taxation,\r\n work infinite harm. I _do_ believe that the wealth of the Republic\r\n is practically free from federal taxation, and that the burdens of\r\n government fall upon the shoulders of those least able to bear them.\r\n\r\n If you could spend an evening with me among my books and amid my\r\n family, I feel quite sure you would not again class me with those who\r\n make war upon the “decencies and elegancies of civilized life.” And if\r\n you could attend one of my great political meetings in Georgia, and\r\n see the good men and good women who believe in Populism, you would not\r\n continue to class them with those who vote for candidates upon the “no\r\n undershirt” platform.\r\n\r\n In other words, if you understood me and mine your judgment of us\r\n would be different.\r\n\r\n The “cracker” of the South is simply the man who did not buy slaves\r\n to do his work. He did it all himself--like a man. Some of our\r\n best generals in war, and magistrates in peace, have come from the\r\n “cracker” class. As a matter of fact, however, my own people, from\r\n my father back to Revolutionary times, were slave owners and land\r\n owners. In the first meeting held in Georgia to express sympathy with\r\n the Boston patriots my great-great-grandfather bore a prominent part,\r\n and in the first State legislature ever convened in Georgia one of my\r\n ancestors was the representative of his county.\r\n\r\n My grandfather was wealthy, and so was my father. My boyhood was spent\r\n in the idleness of a rich man’s son. It was not till I was in my teens\r\n that misfortune overtook us, sent us homeless into the world, and\r\n deprived me of the thorough collegiate training my father intended for\r\n me.\r\n\r\n At sixteen years of age I thus had to commence life moneyless, and the\r\n weary years I spent among the poor, the kindness I received in their\r\n homes, and the acquaintance I made with the hardship of their lives,\r\n gave me that profound sympathy for them which I yet retain--though I\r\n am no longer poor myself.\r\n\r\n Pardon the liberty I take in intruding this letter upon you. I have\r\n followed your work in New York with admiring sympathy, and have\r\n frequently written of it in my paper. While hundreds of miles separate\r\n us, and our tasks and methods have been widely different, I must still\r\n believe that we have much in common, and that the ruling force which\r\n actuates us both is to challenge wrong and to fight the battles of\r\n good government.\r\n\r\n                                               Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                               (Signed) THOS. E. WATSON.\r\n\r\n                                        THOMPSON, GA., August, 30, 1896.\r\n\r\nI intended to draw a very sharp line between Mr. Watson and many\r\nof those associated with him in the same movement; and certain of\r\nthe sentences which he quotes as if they were meant to apply to him\r\nwere, on the contrary, meant to apply generally to the agitators who\r\nproclaimed both him and Mr. Bryan as their champions, and especially to\r\nmany of the men who were running on the Populist tickets in different\r\nStates. To Mr. Watson’s own sincerity and courage I thought I had paid\r\nfull tribute, and if I failed in any way I wish to make good that\r\nfailure. I was in Washington when Mr. Watson was in Congress, and I\r\nknow how highly he was esteemed personally by his colleagues, even\r\nby those differing very widely from him in matters of principle. The\r\nstaunchest friends of order and decent government fully and cordially\r\nrecognized Mr. Watson’s honesty and good faith--men, for instance, like\r\nSenator Lodge of Massachusetts, and Representative Bellamy Storer of\r\nOhio. Moreover, I sympathize as little as Mr. Watson with denunciation\r\nof the “cracker,” and I may mention that one of my forefathers was the\r\nfirst Revolutionary Governor of Georgia at the time that Mr. Watson’s\r\nancestor sat in the first Revolutionary legislature of the State. Mr.\r\nWatson himself embodies not a few of the very attributes the lack\r\nof which we feel so keenly in many of our public men. He is brave,\r\nhe is earnest, he is honest, he is disinterested. For many of the\r\nwrongs which he wishes to remedy, I, too, believe that a remedy can be\r\nfound, and for this purpose I would gladly strike hands with him. All\r\nthis makes it a matter of the keenest regret that he should advocate\r\ncertain remedies that we deem even worse than the wrongs complained\r\nof, and should strive in darkling ways to correct other wrongs, or\r\nrather inequalities and sufferings, which exist, not because of the\r\nshortcomings of society, but because of the existence of human nature\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of ugly things about wealth and its possessors in\r\nthe present age, and I suppose there have been in all ages. There are\r\nmany rich people who so utterly lack patriotism, or show such sordid\r\nand selfish traits of character, or lead such mean and vacuous lives,\r\nthat all right-minded men must look upon them with angry contempt;\r\nbut, on the whole, the thrifty are apt to be better citizens than the\r\nthriftless; and the worst capitalist cannot harm laboring men as they\r\nare harmed by demagogues. As the people of a State grow more and more\r\nintelligent the State itself may be able to play a larger and larger\r\npart in the life of the community, while at the same time individual\r\neffort may be given freer and less restricted movement along certain\r\nlines; but it is utterly unsafe to give the State more than the minimum\r\nof power just so long as it contains masses of men who can be moved by\r\nthe pleas and denunciations of the average Socialist leader of to-day.\r\nThere may be better schemes of taxation than those at present employed;\r\nit may be wise to devise inheritance taxes, and to impose regulations\r\non the kinds of business which can be carried on only under the\r\nespecial protection of the State; and where there is a real abuse by\r\nwealth it needs to be, and in this country generally has been, promptly\r\ndone away with; but the first lesson to teach the poor man is that, as\r\na whole, the wealth in the community is distinctly beneficial to him;\r\nthat he is better off in the long run because other men are well off;\r\nand that the surest way to destroy what measure of prosperity he may\r\nhave is to paralyze industry and the well-being of those men who have\r\nachieved success.\r\n\r\nI am not an empiricist; I would no more deny that sometimes human\r\naffairs can be much bettered by legislation than I would affirm that\r\nthey can always be so bettered. I would no more make a fetish of\r\nunrestricted individualism than I would admit the power of the State\r\noffhand and radically to reconstruct society. It may become necessary\r\nto interfere even more than we have done with the right of private\r\ncontract, and to shackle cunning as we have shackled force. All I\r\ninsist upon is that we must be sure of our ground before trying to get\r\nany legislation at all, and that we must not expect too much from this\r\nlegislation, nor refuse to better ourselves a little because we cannot\r\naccomplish everything at a jump. Above all, it is criminal to excite\r\nanger and discontent without proposing a remedy, or only proposing\r\na false remedy. The worst foe of the poor man is the labor leader,\r\nwhether philanthropist or politician, who tries to teach him that he\r\nis a victim of conspiracy and injustice, when in reality he is merely\r\nworking out his fate with blood and sweat as the immense majority of\r\nmen who are worthy of the name always have done and always will have to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe difference between what can and what cannot be done by law is well\r\nexemplified by our experience with the negro problem, an experience\r\nof which Mr. Watson must have ample practical knowledge. The negroes\r\nwere formerly held in slavery. This was a wrong which legislation\r\ncould remedy, and which could not be remedied except by legislation.\r\nAccordingly they were set free by law. This having been done, many of\r\ntheir friends believed that in some way, by additional legislation,\r\nwe could at once put them on an intellectual, social, and business\r\nequality with the whites. The effort has failed completely. In large\r\nsections of the country the negroes are not treated as they should be\r\ntreated, and politically in particular the frauds upon them have been\r\nso gross and shameful as to awaken not merely indignation but bitter\r\nwrath; yet the best friends of the negro admit that his hope lies,\r\nnot in legislation, but in the constant working of those often unseen\r\nforces of the national life which are greater than all legislation.\r\n\r\nIt is but rarely that great advances in general social well-being can\r\nbe made by the adoption of some far-reaching scheme, legislative or\r\notherwise; normally they come only by gradual growth, and by incessant\r\neffort to do first one thing, then another, and then another. Quack\r\nremedies of the universal cure-all type are generally as noxious to the\r\nbody politic as to the body corporal.\r\n\r\nOften the head-in-the-air social reformers, because people of sane and\r\nwholesome minds will not favor their wild schemes, themselves decline\r\nto favor schemes for practical reform. For the last two years there has\r\nbeen an honest effort in New York to give the city good government,\r\nand to work intelligently for better social conditions, especially in\r\nthe poorest quarters. We have cleaned the streets; we have broken the\r\npower of the ward boss and the saloon-keeper to work injustice; we have\r\ndestroyed the most hideous of the tenement houses in which poor people\r\nare huddled like swine in a sty; we have made parks and play-grounds\r\nfor the children in the crowded quarters; in every possible way we\r\nhave striven to make life easier and healthier, and to give man and\r\nwoman a chance to do their best work; while at the same time we have\r\nwarred steadily against the pauper-producing, maudlin philanthropy of\r\nthe free soup-kitchen and tramp lodging-house kind. In all this we\r\nhave had practically no help from either the parlor socialists or the\r\nscarcely more noxious beer-room socialists who are always howling about\r\nthe selfishness of the rich and their unwillingness to do anything for\r\nthose who are less well off.\r\n\r\nThere are certain labor unions, certain bodies of organized\r\nlabor--notably those admirable organizations which include the railway\r\nconductors, the locomotive engineers and the firemen--which to my mind\r\nembody almost the best hope that there is for healthy national growth\r\nin the future; but bitter experience has taught men who work for reform\r\nin New York that the average labor leader, the average demagogue who\r\nshouts for a depreciated currency, or for the overthrow of the rich,\r\nwill not do anything to help those who honestly strive to make better\r\nour civic conditions. There are immense numbers of workingmen to whom\r\nwe can appeal with perfect confidence; but too often we find that a\r\nlarge proportion of the men who style themselves leaders of organized\r\nlabor are influenced only by sullen short-sighted hatred of what they\r\ndo not understand, and are deaf to all appeals, whether to their\r\nnational or to their civic patriotism.\r\n\r\nWhat I most grudge in all this is the fact that sincere and zealous\r\nmen of high character and honest purpose, men like Mr. Watson, men and\r\nwomen such as those he describes as attending his Populist meetings,\r\nor such as are to be found in all strata of our society, from the\r\nemployer to the hardest-worked day laborer, go astray in their methods,\r\nand are thereby prevented from doing the full work for good they ought\r\nto. When a man goes on the wrong road himself he can do very little to\r\nguide others aright, even though these others are also on the wrong\r\nroad. There are many wrongs to be righted; there are many measures\r\nof relief to be pushed; and it is a pity that when we are fighting\r\nwhat is bad and championing what is good, the men who ought to be our\r\nmost effective allies should deprive themselves of usefulness by the\r\nwrong-headedness of their position. Rich men and poor men both do wrong\r\non occasions, and whenever a specific instance of this can be pointed\r\nout all citizens alike should join in punishing the wrong-doer. Honesty\r\nand right-mindedness should be the tests; not wealth or poverty.\r\n\r\nIn our municipal administration here in New York we have acted with\r\nan equal hand toward wrong-doers of high and low degree. The Board of\r\nHealth condemns the tenement-house property of the rich landowner,\r\nwhether this landowner be priest or layman, banker or railroad\r\npresident, lawyer or manager of a real estate business; and it pays no\r\nheed to the intercession of any politician, whether this politician be\r\nCatholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile. At the same time the Police\r\nDepartment promptly suppresses, not only the criminal, but the rioter.\r\nIn other words, we do strict justice. We feel we are defrauded of help\r\nto which we are entitled when men who ought to assist in any work to\r\nbetter the condition of the people decline to aid us because their\r\nbrains are turned by dreams only worthy of a European revolutionist.\r\n\r\nMany workingmen look with distrust upon laws which really would\r\nhelp them; laws for the intelligent restriction of immigration, for\r\ninstance. I have no sympathy with mere dislike of immigrants; there\r\nare classes and even nationalities of them which stand at least on\r\nan equality with the citizens of native birth, as the last election\r\nshowed. But in the interest of our workingmen we must in the end keep\r\nout laborers who are ignorant, vicious, and with low standards of life\r\nand comfort, just as we have shut out the Chinese.\r\n\r\nOften labor leaders and the like denounce the present conditions of\r\nsociety, and especially of our political life, for shortcomings which\r\nthey themselves have been instrumental in causing. In our cities the\r\nmisgovernment is due, not to the misdeeds of the rich, but to the low\r\nstandard of honesty and morality among citizens generally; and nothing\r\nhelps the corrupt politician more than substituting either wealth or\r\npoverty for honesty as the standard by which to try a candidate. A\r\nfew months ago a socialistic reformer in New York was denouncing the\r\ncorruption caused by rich men because a certain judge was suspected of\r\ngiving information in advance as to a decision in a case involving the\r\ninterests of a great corporation. Now this judge had been elected some\r\nyears previously, mainly because he was supposed to be a representative\r\nof the “poor man”; and the socialistic reformer himself, a year ago,\r\nwas opposing the election of Mr. Beaman as judge because he was one of\r\nthe firm of Evarts & Choate, who were friends of various millionaires\r\nand were counsel for various corporations. But if Mr. Beaman had been\r\nelected judge no human being, rich or poor, would have dared so much as\r\nhint at his doing anything improper.\r\n\r\nSomething can be done by good laws; more can be done by honest\r\nadministration of the laws; but most of all can be done by frowning\r\nresolutely upon the preachers of vague discontent; and by upholding\r\nthe true doctrine of self-reliance, self-help, and self-mastery. This\r\ndoctrine sets forth many things. Among them is the fact that though a\r\nman can occasionally be helped when he stumbles, yet that it is useless\r\nto try to carry him when he will not or cannot walk; and worse than\r\nuseless to try to bring down the work and reward of the thrifty and\r\nintelligent to the level of the capacity of the weak, the shiftless,\r\nand the idle. It further shows that the maudlin philanthropist and the\r\nmaudlin sentimentalist are almost as noxious as the demagogue, and that\r\nit is even more necessary to temper mercy with justice than justice\r\nwith mercy.\r\n\r\nThe worst lesson that can be taught a man is to rely upon others and\r\nto whine over his sufferings. If an American is to amount to anything\r\nhe must rely upon himself, and not upon the State; he must take pride\r\nin his own work, instead of sitting idle to envy the luck of others;\r\nhe must face life with resolute courage, win victory if he can, and\r\naccept defeat if he must, without seeking to place on his fellow-men a\r\nresponsibility which is not theirs.\r\n\r\nLet me say in conclusion, that I do not write in the least from the\r\nstandpoint of those whose association is purely with what are called\r\nthe wealthy classes. The men with whom I have worked and associated\r\nmost closely during the last couple of years here in New York, with\r\nwhom I have shared what is at least an earnest desire to better social\r\nand civic conditions (neither blinking what is evil nor being misled\r\nby the apostles of a false remedy), and with whose opinions as to what\r\nis right and practical my own in the main agree, are not capitalists,\r\nsave as all men who by toil earn, and with prudence save, money are\r\ncapitalists. They include reporters on the daily papers, editors of\r\nmagazines, as well as of newspapers, principals in the public schools,\r\nyoung lawyers, young architects, young doctors, young men of business,\r\nwho are struggling to rise in their profession by dint of faithful\r\nwork, but who give some of their time to doing what they can for the\r\ncity, and a number of priests and clergymen; but as it happens the\r\nlist does not include any man of great wealth, or any of those men\r\nwhose names are in the public mind identified with great business\r\ncorporations. Most of them have at one time or another in their\r\nlives faced poverty and know what it is; none of them are more than\r\nwell-to-do. They include Catholics and Protestants, Jews, and men who\r\nwould be regarded as heterodox by professors of most recognized creeds;\r\nsome of them were born on this side, others are of foreign birth; but\r\nthey are all Americans, heart and soul, who fight out for themselves\r\nthe battles of their own lives, meeting sometimes defeat and sometimes\r\nvictory. They neither forget that man does owe a duty to his fellows,\r\nand should strive to do what he can to increase the well-being of the\r\ncommunity; nor yet do they forget that in the long run the only way to\r\nhelp people is to make them help themselves. They are prepared to try\r\nany properly guarded legislative remedy for ills which they believe\r\ncan be remedied; but they perceive clearly that it is both foolish and\r\nwicked to teach the average man who is not well off that some wrong\r\nor injustice has been done him, and that he should hope for redress\r\nelsewhere than in his own industry, honesty, and intelligence.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] _Review of Reviews_, January, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI\r\n\r\n                        THE MONROE DOCTRINE[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine should not be considered from any purely academic\r\nstandpoint, but as a broad, general principle of living policy. It is\r\nto be justified not by precedent merely, but by the needs of the nation\r\nand the true interests of Western civilization. It, of course, adds\r\nstrength to our position at this moment to show that the action of the\r\nnational authorities is warranted by the actions of their predecessors\r\non like occasions in time past, and that the line of policy we are now\r\npursuing is that which has been pursued by all our statesmen of note\r\nsince the republic grew sufficiently powerful to make what it said\r\nof weight in foreign affairs. But even if in time past we had been\r\nas blind to the national honor and welfare as are the men who at the\r\npresent day champion the anti-American side of the Venezuelan question,\r\nit would now be necessary for statesmen who were both far-sighted and\r\npatriotic to enunciate the principles for which the Monroe Doctrine\r\nstands. In other words, if the Monroe Doctrine did not already exist it\r\nwould be necessary forthwith to create it.\r\n\r\nLet us first of all clear the question at issue by brushing away one\r\nor two false objections. Lord Salisbury at first put in emphatic words\r\nhis refusal in any way to recognize the Monroe Doctrine as part of the\r\nlaw of nations or as binding upon Great Britain. Most British statesmen\r\nand publicists followed his lead; but recently a goodly number have\r\nshown an inclination to acquiesce in the views of Lord Salisbury’s\r\ncolleague, Mr. Chamberlain, who announces, with bland indifference to\r\nthe expressed opinion of his nominal chief, that England does recognize\r\nthe existence of the Monroe Doctrine and never thought of ignoring it.\r\nLord Salisbury himself has recently shown symptoms of changing ground\r\nand taking this position; while Mr. Balfour has gone still farther in\r\nthe right direction, and the Liberal leaders farther yet. It is not\r\nvery important to us how far Lord Salisbury and Mr. Chamberlain may\r\ndiverge in their views, although, of course, in the interests of the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples and of peace between England and the United\r\nStates, we trust that Mr. Chamberlain’s position will be sustained\r\nby Great Britain. But the attitude of our own people _is_ important,\r\nand it would be amusing, were it not unpleasant, to see that many\r\nAmericans, whose Americanism is of the timid and flabby type, have\r\nbeen inclined eagerly to agree with Lord Salisbury. A very able member\r\nof the New York bar remarked the other day that he had not yet met the\r\nlawyer who agreed with Secretary Olney as to the legal interpretation\r\nof the Monroe Doctrine. This remark was chiefly interesting as showing\r\nthe lawyer’s own limitations. It would not have been made if he had\r\nmet the Justices of the Supreme Court, for instance; but even on the\r\nunfounded supposition that his remark was well grounded, it would have\r\nhad little more significance than if he had said that he had not yet\r\nmet a dentist who agreed with Mr. Olney. The Monroe Doctrine is not a\r\nquestion of law at all. It is a question of policy. It is a question\r\nto be considered not only by statesmen, but by all good citizens.\r\nLawyers, as lawyers, have absolutely nothing whatever to say about it.\r\nTo argue that it cannot be recognized as a principle of international\r\nlaw, is a mere waste of breath. Nobody cares whether it is or is not\r\nso recognized, any more than any one cares whether the Declaration of\r\nIndependence and Washington’s farewell address are so recognized.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe Doctrine may be briefly defined as forbidding European\r\nencroachment on American soil. It is not desirable to define it so\r\nrigidly as to prevent our taking into account the varying degrees\r\nof national interest in varying cases. The United States has not\r\nthe slightest wish to establish a universal protectorate over other\r\nAmerican States, or to become responsible for their misdeeds. If one\r\nof them becomes involved in an ordinary quarrel with a European power,\r\nsuch quarrel must be settled between them by any one of the usual\r\nmethods. But no European State is to be allowed to aggrandize itself\r\non American soil at the expense of any American State. Furthermore, no\r\ntransfer of an American colony from one European State to another is to\r\nbe permitted, if, in the judgment of the United States, such transfer\r\nwould be hostile to its own interests.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, who, during the presidency of Monroe, first clearly\r\nenunciated the doctrine which bears his chief’s name, asserted it as\r\nagainst both Spain and Russia. In the clearest and most emphatic terms\r\nhe stated that the United States could not acquiesce in the acquisition\r\nof new territory within the limits of any independent American State,\r\nwhether in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, by any European\r\npower. He took this position against Russia when Russia threatened\r\nto take possession of what is now Oregon. He took this position as\r\nagainst Spain when, backed by other powers of Continental Europe, she\r\nthreatened to reconquer certain of the Spanish-American States.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely and exactly the position the United States has now\r\ntaken in reference to England and Venezuela. It is idle to contend that\r\nthere is any serious difference in the application of the doctrine to\r\nthe two sets of questions. An American may, of course, announce his\r\nopposition to the Monroe Doctrine, although by so doing he forfeits\r\nall title to far-seeing and patriotic devotion to the interests of his\r\ncountry. But he cannot argue that the Monroe Doctrine does not apply\r\nto the present case, unless he argues that the Monroe Doctrine has no\r\nexistence whatsoever. In fact, such arguments are, on their face, so\r\nabsurd that they need no refutation, and can be relegated where they\r\nbelong--to the realm of the hair-splitting schoolmen. They have no\r\nconcern either for practical politicians or for historians with true\r\nhistoric insight.\r\n\r\nWe have asserted the principles which underlie the Monroe Doctrine, not\r\nonly against Russia and Spain, but also against France, on at least two\r\ndifferent occasions. The last and most important was when the French\r\nconquered Mexico and made it into an Empire. It is not necessary to\r\nrecall to any one the action of our Government in the matter as soon\r\nas the Civil War came to an end. Suffice it to say that, under threat\r\nof our interposition, the French promptly abandoned Maximilian, and\r\nthe latter’s Empire fell. Long before this, however, and a score of\r\nyears before the Doctrine was christened by the name Monroe even the\r\ntimid statesmen of the Jeffersonian era embodied its principle in\r\ntheir protest against the acquisition of Louisiana, by France, from\r\nSpain. Spain at that time held all of what is now the Great West.\r\nFrance wished to acquire it. Our statesmen at once announced that they\r\nwould regard as hostile to America the transfer of the territory in\r\nquestion from a weak to a strong European power. Under the American\r\npressure the matter was finally settled by the sale of the territory in\r\nquestion to the United States. The principle which our statesmen then\r\nannounced was in kind precisely the same as that upon which we should\r\nnow act if Germany sought to acquire Cuba from Spain, or St. Thomas\r\nfrom the Danes. In either of these events it is hardly conceivable that\r\nthe United States would hesitate to interfere, if necessary, by force\r\nof arms; and in so doing the national authorities would undoubtedly\r\nbe supported by the immense majority of the American people, and,\r\nindeed, by all save the men of abnormal timidity or abnormal political\r\nshort-sightedness.\r\n\r\nHistorically, therefore, the position of our representatives in the\r\nVenezuelan question is completely justified. It cannot be attacked on\r\nacademic grounds. The propriety of their position is even more easily\r\ndefensible.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, our action is based on national self-interest. In other\r\nwords, it is patriotic. A certain limited number of persons are fond\r\nof decrying patriotism as a selfish virtue, and strive with all their\r\nfeeble might to inculcate in its place a kind of milk-and-water\r\ncosmopolitanism. These good people are never men of robust character or\r\nof imposing personality, and the plea itself is not worth considering.\r\nSome reformers may urge that in the ages’ distant future patriotism,\r\nlike the habit of monogamous marriage, will become a needless and\r\nobsolete virtue; but just at present the man who loves other countries\r\nas much as he does his own is quite as noxious a member of society as\r\nthe man who loves other women as much as he loves his wife. Love of\r\ncountry is an elemental virtue, like love of home, or like honesty or\r\ncourage. No country will accomplish very much for the world at large\r\nunless it elevates itself. The useful member of a community is the man\r\nwho first and foremost attends to his own rights and his own duties,\r\nand who therefore becomes better fitted to do his share in the common\r\nduties of all. The useful member of the brotherhood of nations is that\r\nnation which is most thoroughly saturated with the national idea, and\r\nwhich realizes most fully its rights as a nation and its duties to its\r\nown citizens. This is in no way incompatible with a scrupulous regard\r\nfor the rights of other nations, or a desire to remedy the wrongs of\r\nsuffering peoples.\r\n\r\nThe United States ought not to permit any great military powers,\r\nwhich have no foothold on this continent, to establish such foothold;\r\nnor should they permit any aggrandizement of those who already have\r\npossessions on the continent. We do not wish to bring ourselves to a\r\nposition where we shall have to emulate the European system of enormous\r\narmies. Every true patriot, every man of statesman-like habit, should\r\nlook forward to the day when not a single European power will hold\r\na foot of American soil. At present it is not necessary to take the\r\nposition that no European power shall hold American territory; but it\r\ncertainly will become necessary, if the timid and selfish “peace at any\r\nprice” men have their way, and if the United States fails to check at\r\nthe outset European aggrandizement on this continent.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, therefore, it is to the interest of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States to prevent the further colonial growth of European powers\r\nin the Western Hemisphere. But this is also to the interest of all the\r\npeople of the Western Hemisphere. At best, the inhabitants of a colony\r\nare in a cramped and unnatural state. At the worst, the establishment\r\nof a colony prevents any healthy popular growth. Some time in the dim\r\nfuture it may be that all the English-speaking peoples will be able\r\nto unite in some kind of confederacy. However desirable this would\r\nbe, it is, under existing conditions, only a dream. At present the\r\nonly hope for a colony that wishes to attain full moral and mental\r\ngrowth, is to become an independent State, or part of an independent\r\nState. No English colony now stands on a footing of genuine equality\r\nwith the parent State. As long as the Canadian remains a colonist,\r\nhe remains in a position which is distinctly inferior to that of his\r\ncousins, both in England and in the United States. The Englishman at\r\nbottom looks down on the Canadian, as he does on any one who admits\r\nhis inferiority, and quite properly, too. The American, on the other\r\nhand, with equal propriety, regards the Canadian with the good-natured\r\ncondescension always felt by the freeman for the man who is not free.\r\nA funny instance of the English attitude toward Canada was shown\r\nafter Lord Dunraven’s inglorious _fiasco_ last September, when the\r\nCanadian yachtsman, Rose, challenged for the America cup. The English\r\njournals repudiated him on the express ground that a Canadian was not\r\nan Englishman and not entitled to the privileges of an Englishman.\r\nIn their comments, many of them showed a dislike for Americans which\r\nalmost rose to hatred. The feeling they displayed for the Canadians was\r\nnot one of dislike. It was one of contempt.\r\n\r\nUnder the best of circumstances, therefore, a colony is in a false\r\nposition. But if the colony is in a region where the colonizing race\r\nhas to do its work by means of other inferior races the condition is\r\nmuch worse. From the standpoint of the race little or nothing has been\r\ngained by the English conquest and colonization of Jamaica. Jamaica has\r\nmerely been turned into a negro island, with a future, seemingly, much\r\nlike that of San Domingo. British Guiana, however well administered, is\r\nnothing but a colony where a few hundred or few thousand white men hold\r\nthe superior positions, while the bulk of the population is composed\r\nof Indians, Negroes, and Asiatics. Looked at through the vista of the\r\ncenturies, such a colony contains less promise of true growth than\r\ndoes a State like Venezuela or Ecuador. The history of most of the\r\nSouth American republics has been both mean and bloody; but there is\r\nat least a chance that they may develop, after infinite tribulations\r\nand suffering, into a civilization quite as high and stable as that of\r\nsuch a European power as Portugal. But there is no such chance for\r\nany tropical American colony owned by a Northern European race. It is\r\ndistinctly in the interest of civilization that the present States in\r\nthe two Americas should develop along their own lines, and however\r\ndesirable it is that many of them should receive European immigration,\r\nit is highly undesirable that any of them should be under European\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nSo much for the general principles, and the justification, historically\r\nand morally, of the Monroe Doctrine. Now take the specific case at\r\nissue. Great Britain has a boundary dispute with Venezuela. She claims\r\nas her own a territory which Venezuela asserts to be hers, a territory\r\nwhich in point of size very nearly equals the Kingdom of Italy. Our\r\ngovernment, of course, cannot, if it wishes to remain true to the\r\ntraditions of the Monroe Doctrine submit to the acquisition by England\r\nof such an enormous tract of territory, and it must therefore find out\r\nwhether the English claims are or are not well founded. It would, of\r\ncourse, be preposterous to lay down the rule that no European power\r\nshould seize American territory which was not its own, and yet to\r\npermit the power itself to decide the question of the ownership of\r\nsuch territory. Great Britain refused to settle the question either by\r\namicable agreement with Venezuela or by arbitration. All that remained\r\nfor the United States, was to do what it actually did; that is, to try\r\nto find out the facts for itself, by its own commission. If the facts\r\nshow England to be in the right, well and good. If they show England\r\nto be in the wrong, we most certainly ought not to permit her to\r\nprofit, at Venezuela’s expense, by her own wrong-doing.\r\n\r\nWe are doing exactly what England would very properly do in a like\r\ncase. Recently, when the German Emperor started to interfere in the\r\nTransvaal, England promptly declared her own “Monroe Doctrine” for\r\nSouth Africa. We do not propose to see English filibusters try at\r\nthe expense of Venezuela the same policy which recently came to such\r\nan ignominious end in the Transvaal, in a piece of weak, would-be\r\nbuccaneering, which, it is perhaps not unfair to say was fittingly\r\ncommemorated in the verse of the new poet-laureate.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to overestimate the good done in this country\r\nby the vigorous course already taken by the national executive and\r\nlegislature in this matter. The lesson taught Lord Salisbury is one\r\nwhich will not soon be forgotten by English statesmen. His position\r\nis false, and is recognized as false by the best English statesmen\r\nand publicists. If he does not consent to arrange the matter with\r\nVenezuela, it will have to be arranged in some way by arbitration.\r\nIn either case, the United States gains its point. The only possible\r\ndanger of war comes from the action of the selfish and timid men\r\non this side of the water, who clamorously strive to misrepresent\r\nAmerican, and to mislead English, public opinion. If they succeed in\r\npersuading Lord Salisbury that the American people will back down if\r\nhe presses them, they will do the greatest damage possible to both\r\ncountries, for they will render war, at some time in the future,\r\nalmost inevitable.\r\n\r\nSuch a war we would deplore; but it must be distinctly understood that\r\nwe would deplore it very much more for England’s sake than for our\r\nown; for whatever might be the initial fortunes of the struggle, or\r\nthe temporary damage and loss to the United States, the mere fact that\r\nCanada would inevitably be rent from England in the end would make the\r\noutcome an English disaster.\r\n\r\nWe do not in any way seek to become the sponsor of the South American\r\nStates. England has the same right to protect her own subjects, or even\r\nin exceptional cases to interfere to stop outrages in South America,\r\nthat we have to interfere in Armenia--and it is to be regretted that\r\nour representatives do not see their way clear to interfere for\r\nArmenia. But England should not acquire territory at the expense of\r\nVenezuela any more than we should acquire it at the expense of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Armenia brings up a peculiarly hypocritical plea which\r\nhas been advanced against us in this controversy. It has been solemnly\r\nalleged that our action in Venezuela has hampered England in the East\r\nand has prevented her interfering on behalf of Armenia. We do not\r\nwish to indulge in recriminations, but when such a plea is advanced,\r\nthe truth, however unpleasant, must be told. The great crime of this\r\ncentury against civilization has been the upholding of the Turk by\r\ncertain Christian powers. To England’s attitude in the Crimean War,\r\nand after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, the present Armenian horror is\r\nprimarily due. Moreover, for six months before the Venezuelan question\r\narose England had looked on motionless while the Turks perpetrated on\r\ntheir wretched subjects wrongs that would blast the memory of Attila.\r\n\r\nWe do not wish to be misunderstood. We have no feeling against England.\r\nOn the contrary, we regard her as being well in advance of the great\r\npowers of Continental Europe, and we have more sympathy with her. In\r\ngeneral, her success tells for the success of civilization, and we wish\r\nher well. But where her interests enlist her against the progress of\r\ncivilization and in favor of the oppression of other nationalities who\r\nare struggling upward, our sympathies are immediately forfeited.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of serious concern to every college man, and, indeed,\r\nto every man who believes in the good effects of a liberal education,\r\nto see the false views which seem to obtain among so many of the\r\nleaders of educated thought, not only upon the Monroe Doctrine,\r\nbut upon every question which involves the existence of a feeling\r\nof robust Americanism. Every educated man who puts himself out of\r\ntouch with the current of American thought, and who on conspicuous\r\noccasions assumes an attitude hostile to the interest of America, is\r\ndoing what he can to weaken the influence of educated men in American\r\nlife. The crude, ill-conditioned jealousy of education, which is so\r\noften and so lamentably shown by large bodies of our people, is\r\nimmensely stimulated by the action of those prominent educated men in\r\nwhom education seems to have destroyed the strong, virile virtues and\r\nespecially the spirit of Americanism.\r\n\r\nNo nation can achieve real greatness if its people are not both\r\nessentially moral and essentially manly; both sets of qualities\r\nare necessary. It is an admirable thing to possess refinement and\r\ncultivation, but the price is too dear if they must be paid for at\r\nthe cost of the rugged fighting qualities which make a man able to do\r\na man’s work in the world, and which make his heart beat with that\r\nkind of love of country which is shown not only in readiness to try\r\nto make her civic life better, but also to stand up manfully for her\r\nwhen her honor and influence are at stake in a dispute with a foreign\r\npower. A heavy responsibility rests on the educated man. It is a double\r\ndiscredit to him to go wrong, whether his shortcomings take the form of\r\nshirking his every-day civic duties, or of abandonment of the nation’s\r\nrights in a foreign quarrel. He must no more be misled by the sneers of\r\nthose who always write “patriotism” between inverted commas than by the\r\ncoarser, but equally dangerous, ridicule of the politicians who jeer\r\nat “reform.” It is as unmanly to be taunted by one set of critics into\r\ncowardice as it is to be taunted by the other set into dishonesty.\r\n\r\nThere are many upright and honorable men who take the wrong side,\r\nthat is, the anti-American side, of the Monroe Doctrine because they\r\nare too short-sighted or too unimaginative to realize the hurt to\r\nthe nation that would be caused by the adoption of their views. There\r\nare other men who take the wrong view simply because they have not\r\nthought much of the matter, or are in unfortunate surroundings, by\r\nwhich they have been influenced to their own moral hurt. There are yet\r\nother men in whom the mainspring of the opposition to that branch of\r\nAmerican policy known as the Monroe Doctrine is sheer timidity. This is\r\nsometimes the ordinary timidity of wealth. Sometimes, however, it is\r\npeculiarly developed among educated men whose education has tended to\r\nmake them over-cultivated and over-sensitive to foreign opinion. They\r\nare generally men who undervalue the great fighting qualities, without\r\nwhich no nation can ever rise to the first rank.\r\n\r\nThe timidity of wealth is proverbial, and it was well illustrated by\r\nthe attitude taken by too many people of means at the time of the\r\nVenezuela trouble. Many of them, including bankers, merchants, and\r\nrailway magnates, criticised the action of the President and the\r\nSenate, on the ground that it had caused business disturbance. Such\r\na position is essentially ignoble. When a question of national honor\r\nor of national right or wrong, is at stake, no question of financial\r\ninterest should be considered for a moment. Those wealthy men who wish\r\nthe abandonment of the Monroe Doctrine because its assertion may damage\r\ntheir business, bring discredit to themselves, and, so far as they are\r\nable, discredit to the nation of which they are a part.\r\n\r\nIt is an evil thing for any man of education to forget that education\r\nshould intensify patriotism, and that patriotism must not only be shown\r\nby striving to do good to the country from within, but by readiness to\r\nuphold its interests and honor, at any cost, when menaced from without.\r\nEducated men owe to the community the serious performance of this duty.\r\nWe need not concern ourselves with the _emigré_ educated man, the\r\nAmerican who deliberately takes up his permanent abode abroad, whether\r\nin London or Paris; he is usually a man of weak character, unfitted to\r\ndo good work either abroad or at home, who does what he can for his\r\ncountry by relieving it of his presence. But the case is otherwise\r\nwith the American who stays at home, and tries to teach the youth of\r\nhis country to disbelieve in the country’s rights, as against other\r\ncountries, and to regard it as the sign of an enlightened spirit to\r\ndecry the assertion of those rights by force of arms. This man may be\r\ninefficient for good; but he is capable at times of doing harm, because\r\nhe tends to make other people inefficient likewise. In our municipal\r\npolitics there has long been evident a tendency to gather in one group\r\nthe people who have no scruples, but who are very efficient, and in\r\nanother group the amiable people who are not efficient at all. This\r\nis but one manifestation of the general and very unwholesome tendency\r\namong certain educated people to lose the power of doing efficient\r\nwork as they acquire refinement. Of course in the long run a really\r\ngood education will give not only refinement, but also an increase of\r\npower, and of capacity for efficient work. But the man who forgets that\r\na real education must include the cultivation of the fighting virtues\r\nis sure to manifest this tendency to inefficiency. It is exhibited on\r\na national scale by the educated men who take the anti-American side\r\nof international questions. There are exceptions to the rule; but as a\r\nrule the healthy man, resolute to do the rough work of the world, and\r\ncapable of feeling his veins tingle with pride over the great deeds\r\nof the men of his own nation, will naturally take the American side\r\nof such a question as the Monroe Doctrine. Similarly, the anæmic man\r\nof refinement and cultivation, whose intellect has been educated at\r\nthe expense of his character, and who shrinks from all these struggles\r\nthrough which alone the world moves on to greatness, is inclined to\r\nconsider any expression of the Monroe Doctrine as truculent and ill\r\nadvised.\r\n\r\nOf course, many strong men who are good citizens on ordinary occasions\r\ntake the latter view simply because they have been misled. The colonial\r\nhabit of thought dies hard. It is to be wished that those who are\r\ncursed with it would, in endeavoring to emulate the ways of the old\r\nworld, endeavor to emulate one characteristic which has been shared\r\nby every old-world nation, and which is possessed to a marked degree\r\nby England. Every decent Englishman is devoted to his country, first,\r\nlast, and all the time. An Englishman may or may not dislike America,\r\nbut he is invariably for England and against America when any question\r\narises between them; and I heartily respect him for so being. Let our\r\nown people of the partially colonial type copy this peculiarity and it\r\nwill be much to their credit.\r\n\r\nThe finest speech that for many years has been delivered by a college\r\nman to other college men was that made last spring by Judge Holmes,\r\nhimself a gallant soldier of the Civil War, in that hall which Harvard\r\nhas erected to commemorate those of her sons who perished when the\r\nNorth strove with the South. It should be graven on the heart of every\r\ncollege man, for it has in it that lift of the soul toward things\r\nheroic that makes the eyes burn and the veins thrill. It must be read\r\nin its entirety, for no quotation could do justice to its fine scorn\r\nof the mere money-maker, its lofty fealty to a noble ideal, and, above\r\nall, its splendid love of country and splendid praise of the valor of\r\nthose who strive on stricken fields that the honor of their nation may\r\nbe upheld.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, indeed, that in a country where words like those of\r\nJudge Holmes can be spoken, there should exist men who actually oppose\r\nthe building of a navy by the United States, nay, even more, actually\r\noppose so much as the strengthening of the coast defences, on the\r\nground that they prefer to have this country too feeble to resent\r\nany insult, in order that it may owe its safety to the contemptuous\r\nforbearance which it is hoped this feebleness will inspire in foreign\r\npowers. No Tammany alderman, no venal legislator, no demagogue or\r\ncorrupt politician, ever strove more effectively than these men are\r\nstriving to degrade the nation and to make one ashamed of the name of\r\nAmerica. When we remember that among them there are college graduates,\r\nit is a relief to remember that the leaders on the side of manliness\r\nand of love of country are also college graduates. Every believer\r\nin scholarship and in a liberal education, every believer in the\r\nrobust qualities of heart, mind, and body without which cultivation\r\nand refinement are of no avail, must rejoice to think that, in the\r\npresent crisis, college men have been prominent among the leaders whose\r\nfar-sighted statesmanship and resolute love of country have made those\r\nof us who are really Americans proud of the nation. Secretary Olney is\r\na graduate of Brown; Senator Lodge, who took the lead in the Senate on\r\nthis matter, is a graduate of Harvard; and no less than three members\r\nof the Boundary Commission are graduates of Yale.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] The Bachelor of Arts, March, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n\r\n                   WASHINGTON’S FORGOTTEN MAXIM[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nA century has passed since Washington wrote “To be prepared for war is\r\nthe most effectual means to promote peace.” We pay to this maxim the\r\nlip loyalty we so often pay to Washington’s words; but it has never\r\nsunk deep into our hearts. Indeed of late years many persons have\r\nrefused it even the poor tribute of lip loyalty, and prate about the\r\niniquity of war as if somehow that was a justification for refusing to\r\ntake the steps which can alone in the long run prevent war or avert the\r\ndreadful disasters it brings in its train. The truth of the maxim is\r\nso obvious to every man of really far-sighted patriotism that its mere\r\nstatement seems trite and useless; and it is not over-creditable to\r\neither our intelligence or our love of country that there should be,\r\nas there is, need to dwell upon and amplify such a truism.\r\n\r\nIn this country there is not the slightest danger of an\r\nover-development of warlike spirit, and there never has been any\r\nsuch danger. In all our history there has never been a time when\r\npreparedness for war was any menace to peace. On the contrary, again\r\nand again we have owed peace to the fact that we were prepared for war;\r\nand in the only contest which we have had with a European power since\r\nthe Revolution, the war of 1812, the struggle and all its attendant\r\ndisasters, were due solely to the fact that we were not prepared to\r\nface, and were not ready instantly to resent, an attack upon our honor\r\nand interest; while the glorious triumphs at sea which redeemed that\r\nwar were due to the few preparations which we had actually made. We are\r\na great peaceful nation; a nation of merchants and manufacturers, of\r\nfarmers and mechanics; a nation of workingmen, who labor incessantly\r\nwith head or hand. It is idle to talk of such a nation ever being led\r\ninto a course of wanton aggression or conflict with military powers by\r\nthe possession of a sufficient navy.\r\n\r\nThe danger is of precisely the opposite character. If we forget that\r\nin the last resort we can only secure peace by being ready and willing\r\nto fight for it, we may some day have bitter cause to realize that a\r\nrich nation which is slothful, timid, or unwieldy is an easy prey for\r\nany people which still retains those most valuable of all qualities,\r\nthe soldierly virtues. We but keep to the traditions of Washington,\r\nto the traditions of all the great Americans who struggled for the\r\nreal greatness of America, when we strive to build up those fighting\r\nqualities for the lack of which in a nation, as in an individual, no\r\nrefinement, no culture, no wealth, no material prosperity, can atone.\r\n\r\nPreparation for war is the surest guaranty for peace. Arbitration is\r\nan excellent thing, but ultimately those who wish to see this country\r\nat peace with foreign nations will be wise if they place reliance upon\r\na first-class fleet of first-class battle-ships rather than on any\r\narbitration treaty which the wit of man can devise. Nelson said that\r\nthe British fleet was the best negotiator in Europe, and there was much\r\ntruth in the saying. Moreover, while we are sincere and earnest in our\r\nadvocacy of peace, we must not forget that an ignoble peace is worse\r\nthan any war. We should engrave in our legislative halls those splendid\r\nlines of Lowell:\r\n\r\n    “Come, Peace! not like a mourner bowed\r\n      For honor lost and dear ones wasted,\r\n    But proud, to meet a people proud,\r\n      With eyes that tell of triumph tasted!”\r\n\r\nPeace is a goddess only when she comes with sword girt on thigh. The\r\nship of state can be steered safely only when it is always possible to\r\nbring her against any foe with “her leashed thunders gathering for the\r\nleap.” A really great people, proud and high-spirited, would face all\r\nthe disasters of war rather than purchase that base prosperity which\r\nis bought at the price of national honor. All the great masterful races\r\nhave been fighting races, and the minute that a race loses the hard\r\nfighting virtues, then, no matter what else it may retain, no matter\r\nhow skilled in commerce and finance, in science or art, it has lost its\r\nproud right to stand as the equal of the best. Cowardice in a race,\r\nas in an individual, is the unpardonable sin, and a wilful failure to\r\nprepare for danger may in its effects be as bad as cowardice. The timid\r\nman who cannot fight, and the selfish, short-sighted, or foolish man\r\nwho will not take the steps that will enable him to fight, stand on\r\nalmost the same plane.\r\n\r\nIt is not only true that a peace may be so ignoble and degrading as\r\nto be worse than any war; it is also true that it may be fraught with\r\nmore bloodshed than most wars. Of this there has been melancholy\r\nproof during the last two years. Thanks largely to the very unhealthy\r\ninfluence of the men whose business it is to speculate in the money\r\nmarket, and who approach every subject from the financial standpoint,\r\npurely; and thanks quite as much to the cold-blooded brutality and\r\ncalculating timidity of many European rulers and statesmen, the\r\npeace of Europe has been preserved, while the Turk has been allowed\r\nto butcher the Armenians with hideous and unmentionable barbarity,\r\nand has actually been helped to keep Crete in slavery. War has been\r\naverted at the cost of more bloodshed and infinitely more suffering and\r\ndegradation to wretched women and children than have occurred in any\r\nEuropean struggle since the days of Waterloo. No war of recent years,\r\nno matter how wanton, has been so productive of horrible misery as the\r\npeace which the powers have maintained during the continuance of the\r\nArmenian butcheries. The men who would preach this peace, and indeed\r\nthe men who have preached universal peace in terms that have prepared\r\nthe way for such a peace as this, have inflicted a wrong on humanity\r\ngreater than could be inflicted by the most reckless and war-loving\r\ndespot. Better a thousand times err on the side of over-readiness\r\nto fight, than to err on the side of tame submission to injury, or\r\ncold-blooded indifference to the misery of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nPopular sentiment is just when it selects as popular heroes the men who\r\nhave led in the struggle against malice domestic or foreign levy. No\r\ntriumph of peace is quite so great as the supreme triumphs of war. The\r\ncourage of the soldier, the courage of the statesman who has to meet\r\nstorms which can be quelled only by soldierly qualities--this stands\r\nhigher than any quality called out merely in time of peace. It is by no\r\nmeans necessary that we should have war to develop soldierly attributes\r\nand soldierly qualities; but if the peace we enjoy is of such a kind\r\nthat it causes their loss, then it is far too dearly purchased, no\r\nmatter what may be its attendant benefits. It may be that some time in\r\nthe dim future of the race the need for war will vanish; but that time\r\nis yet ages distant. As yet no nation can hold its place in the world,\r\nor can do any work really worth doing, unless it stands ready to guard\r\nits rights with an armed hand. That orderly liberty which is both the\r\nfoundation and the capstone of our civilization can be gained and kept\r\nonly by men who are willing to fight for an ideal; who hold high the\r\nlove of honor, love of faith, love of flag, and love of country. It is\r\ntrue that no nation can be really great unless it is great in peace; in\r\nindustry, integrity, honesty. Skilled intelligence in civic affairs and\r\nindustrial enterprises alike; the special ability of the artist, the\r\nman of letters, the man of science, and the man of business; the rigid\r\ndetermination to wrong no man, and to stand for righteousness--all\r\nthese are necessary in a great nation. But it is also necessary that\r\nthe nation should have physical no less than moral courage; the\r\ncapacity to do and dare and die at need, and that grim and steadfast\r\nresolution which alone will carry a great people through a great peril.\r\nThe occasion may come at any instant when\r\n\r\n    “’Tis man’s perdition to be safe\r\n    When for the truth he ought to die.”\r\n\r\nAll great nations have shown these qualities. The Dutch held but a\r\nlittle corner of Europe. Their industry, thrift, and enterprise in the\r\npursuits of peace and their cultivation of the arts helped to render\r\nthem great; but these qualities would have been barren had they not\r\nbeen backed by those sterner qualities which rendered them able to\r\nwrest their freedom from the cruel strength of Spain, and to guard it\r\nagainst the banded might of England and of France. The merchants and\r\nthe artists of Holland did much for her; but even more was done by the\r\nfamished burghers who fought to the death on the walls of Harlem and\r\nLeyden, and the great admirals who led their fleets to victory on the\r\nbroad and narrow seas.\r\n\r\nEngland’s history is rich in splendid names and splendid deeds. Her\r\nliterature is even greater than that of Greece. In commerce she\r\nhas stood in the modern world as more than ever Carthage was when\r\ncivilization clustered in a fringe around the Mediterranean. But she\r\nhas risen far higher than ever Greece or Carthage rose, because she\r\npossesses also the great, masterful qualities which were possessed\r\nby the Romans who overthrew them both. England has been fertile in\r\nsoldiers and administrators; in men who triumphed by sea and by land;\r\nin adventurers and explorers who won for her the world’s waste spaces;\r\nand it is because of this that the English-speaking race now shares\r\nwith the Slav the fate of the coming years.\r\n\r\nWe of the United States have passed most of our few years of national\r\nlife in peace. We honor the architects of our wonderful material\r\nprosperity; we appreciate the necessity of thrift, energy, and business\r\nenterprise, and we know that even these are of no avail without the\r\ncivic and social virtues. But we feel, after all, that the men who\r\nhave dared greatly in war, or the work which is akin to war, are\r\nthose who deserve best of the country. The men of Bunker Hill and\r\nTrenton, Saratoga and Yorktown, the men of New Orleans and Mobile\r\nBay, Gettysburg and Appomattox are those to whom we owe most. None\r\nof our heroes of peace, save a few great constructive statesmen, can\r\nrank with our heroes of war. The Americans who stand highest on the\r\nlist of the world’s worthies are Washington, who fought to found the\r\ncountry which he afterward governed, and Lincoln, who saved it through\r\nthe blood of the best and bravest in the land; Washington, the soldier\r\nand statesman, the man of cool head, dauntless heart, and iron will,\r\nthe greatest of good men and the best of great men; and Lincoln, sad,\r\npatient, kindly Lincoln, who for four years toiled and suffered for the\r\npeople, and when his work was done laid down his life that the flag\r\nwhich had been rent in sunder might once more be made whole and without\r\na seam.\r\n\r\nIt is on men such as these, and not on the advocates of peace at any\r\nprice, or upon those so short-sighted that they refuse to take into\r\naccount the possibility of war, that we must rely in every crisis which\r\ndeeply touches the true greatness and true honor of the Republic. The\r\nUnited States has never once in the course of its history suffered harm\r\nbecause of preparation for war, or because of entering into war. But\r\nwe have suffered incalculable harm, again and again, from a foolish\r\nfailure to prepare for war or from reluctance to fight when to fight\r\nwas proper. The men who to-day protest against a navy, and protest\r\nalso against every movement to carry out the traditional policy of the\r\ncountry in foreign affairs, and to uphold the honor of the flag, are\r\nthemselves but following in the course of those who protested against\r\nthe acquisition of the great West, and who failed to make proper\r\npreparations for the war of 1812, or refused to support it after it had\r\nbeen made. They are own brothers to the men whose short-sightedness and\r\nsupine indifference prevented any reorganization of the _personnel_ of\r\nthe Navy during the middle of the century, so that we entered upon the\r\nCivil War with captains seventy years old. They are close kin to the\r\nmen who, when the Southern States seceded, wished to let the Union be\r\ndisrupted in peace rather than restored through the grim agony of armed\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that any considerable number of our citizens\r\nare stamped with this timid lack of patriotism. There are some\r\n_doctrinaires_ whose eyes are so firmly fixed on the golden vision of\r\nuniversal peace that they cannot see the grim facts of real life until\r\nthey stumble over them, to their own hurt, and, what is much worse, to\r\nthe possible undoing of their fellows. There are some educated men in\r\nwhom education merely serves to soften the fibre and to eliminate the\r\nhigher, sterner qualities which tell for national greatness; and these\r\nmen prate about love for mankind, or for another country, as being in\r\nsome hidden way a substitute for love of their own country. What is\r\nof more weight, there are not a few men of means who have made the\r\ntill their fatherland, and who are always ready to balance a temporary\r\ninterruption of money-making, or a temporary financial and commercial\r\ndisaster, against the self-sacrifice necessary in upholding the honor\r\nof the nation and the glory of the flag.\r\n\r\nBut after all these people, though often noisy, form but a small\r\nminority of the whole. They would be swept like chaff before the gust\r\nof popular fury which would surely come if ever the nation really saw\r\nand felt a danger or an insult. The real trouble is that in such a\r\ncase this gust of popular fury would come too late. Unreadiness for\r\nwar is merely rendered more disastrous by readiness to bluster; to\r\ntalk defiance and advocate a vigorous policy in words, while refusing\r\nto back up these words by deeds, is cause for humiliation. It has\r\nalways been true, and in this age it is more than ever true, that it\r\nis too late to prepare for war when the time for peace has passed. The\r\nshort-sightedness of many people, the good-humored indifference to\r\nfacts of others, the sheer ignorance of a vast number, and the selfish\r\nreluctance to insure against future danger by present sacrifice among\r\nyet others--these are the chief obstacles to building up a proper navy\r\nand carrying out a proper foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThe men who opposed the war of 1812, and preferred to have the nation\r\nhumiliated by unresented insult from a foreign power rather than see\r\nher suffer the losses of an honorable conflict, occupied a position\r\nlittle short of contemptible; but it was not much worse than that of\r\nthe men who brought on the war and yet deliberately refused to make the\r\npreparations necessary to carry it to a successful conclusion. The\r\nvisionary schemes for defending the country by gunboats, instead of by\r\na fleet of seagoing battle-ships; the refusal to increase the Navy to a\r\nproper size; the determination to place reliance upon militia instead\r\nof upon regularly trained troops; and the disasters which followed\r\nupon each and every one of these determinations should be studied in\r\nevery school-book in the land so as to enforce in the minds of all our\r\ncitizens the truth of Washington’s adage, that in time of peace it is\r\nnecessary to prepare for war.\r\n\r\nAll this applied in 1812; but it applies with tenfold greater force\r\nnow. Then, as now, it was the Navy upon which the country had to depend\r\nin the event of war with a foreign power; and then, as now, one of the\r\nchief tasks of a wise and far-seeing statesmanship should have been the\r\nupbuilding of a formidable fighting navy. In 1812 untold evils followed\r\nfrom the failure to provide such a fighting navy; for the splendid\r\nfeats of our few cruisers merely showed what could have been done if we\r\nhad had a great fleet of battle-ships. But ships, guns, and men were\r\nmuch more easily provided in time of emergency at the beginning of\r\nthis century than at the end. It takes months to build guns and ships\r\nnow, where it then took days, or at the most, weeks; and it takes far\r\nlonger now to train men to the management of the vast and complicated\r\nengines with which war is waged. Therefore preparation is much more\r\ndifficult, and requires a much longer time; and yet wars are so much\r\nquicker, they last so comparatively short a period, and can be begun\r\nso instantaneously that there is very much less time than formerly in\r\nwhich to make preparations.\r\n\r\nNo battle-ship can be built inside of two years under no matter what\r\nstress of circumstances, for we have not in this country the plant to\r\nenable us to work faster. Cruisers would take almost as long. Even\r\ntorpedo boats, the smallest of all, could not be put in first-class\r\nform under ninety days. Guns available for use against a hostile\r\ninvader would require two or three months; and in the case of the\r\nlarger guns, the only ones really available for the actual shock of\r\nbattle, could not be made under eight months. Rifles and military\r\nmunitions of every kind would require a corresponding length of time\r\nfor preparation; in most cases we should have to build, not merely the\r\nweapons we need, but the plant with which to make them in any large\r\nquantity. Even if the enemy did not interfere with our efforts, which\r\nthey undoubtedly would, it would, therefore, take from three to six\r\nmonths after the outbreak of a war, for which we were unprepared,\r\nbefore we could in the slightest degree remedy our unreadiness. During\r\nthis six months it would be impossible to overestimate the damage that\r\ncould be done by a resolute and powerful antagonist. Even at the end of\r\nthat time we would only be beginning to prepare to parry his attack,\r\nfor it would be two years before we could attempt to return it. Since\r\nthe change in military conditions in modern times there has never been\r\nan instance in which a war between any two nations has lasted more than\r\nabout two years. In most recent wars the operations of the first ninety\r\ndays have decided the result of the conflict. All that followed has\r\nbeen a mere vain effort to strive against the stars in their courses by\r\ndoing at the twelfth hour what it was useless to do after the eleventh.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore make up our minds once for all to the fact that it\r\nis too late to make ready for war when the fight has once begun. The\r\npreparation must come before that. In the case of the Civil War none of\r\nthese conditions applied. In 1861 we had a good fleet, and the Southern\r\nConfederacy had not a ship. We were able to blockade the Southern ports\r\nat once, and we could improvise engines of war more than sufficient\r\nto put against those of an enemy who also had to improvise them, and\r\nwho labored under even more serious disadvantages. The _Monitor_ was\r\ngot ready in the nick of time to meet the _Merrimac_, because the\r\nConfederates had to plan and build the latter while we were planning\r\nand building the former; but if ever we have to go to war with a modern\r\nmilitary power we shall find its Merrimacs already built, and it will\r\nthen be altogether too late to try to build Monitors to meet them.\r\n\r\nIf this point needs any emphasis surely the history of the war of\r\n1812 applies to it. For twelve years before that war broke out even\r\nthe blindest could see that we were almost certain to be drawn\r\ninto hostilities with one or the other of the pair of combatants\r\nwhose battle royal ended at Waterloo. Yet we made not the slightest\r\npreparation for war. The authorities at Washington contented themselves\r\nwith trying to build a flotilla of gunboats which could defend\r\nour own harbors without making it necessary to take the offensive\r\nourselves. We already possessed a dozen first-class cruisers, but\r\nnot a battle-ship of any kind. With almost incredible folly the very\r\nCongress that declared war voted down the bill to increase the Navy\r\nby twenty battle-ships; though it was probably too late then, anyhow,\r\nfor even under the simpler conditions of that day such a fleet could\r\nnot have been built and put into first-class order in less than a\r\ncouple of years. Bitterly did the nation pay for its want of foresight\r\nand forethought. Our cruisers won a number of striking victories,\r\nheartening and giving hope to the nation in the face of disaster; but\r\nthey were powerless to do material harm to the gigantic naval strength\r\nof Great Britain. Efforts were made to increase our little Navy, but in\r\nthe face of a hostile enemy already possessing command of the seas this\r\nwas impossible. Two or three small cruisers were built; but practically\r\nalmost all the fighting on the ocean was done by the handful of\r\nfrigates and sloops which we possessed when the war broke out. Not a\r\nbattle-ship was able to put to sea until after peace was restored.\r\nMeanwhile our coast was blockaded from one end to the other and was\r\nharried at will by the hostile squadrons. Our capital city was burned,\r\nand the ceaseless pressure of the blockade produced such suffering\r\nand irritation as nearly to bring about a civil war among ourselves.\r\nIf in the first decade of the present century the American people and\r\ntheir rulers had possessed the wisdom to provide an efficient fleet of\r\npowerful battle-ships there would probably have been no war of 1812;\r\nand even if war had come, the immense loss to, and destruction of,\r\ntrade and commerce by the blockade would have been prevented. Merely\r\nfrom the monetary standpoint the saving would have been incalculable;\r\nand yet this would have been the smallest part of the gain.\r\n\r\nIt can therefore be taken for granted that there must be adequate\r\npreparation for conflict, if conflict is not to mean disaster.\r\nFurthermore, this preparation must take the shape of an efficient\r\nfighting navy. We have no foe able to conquer or overrun our territory.\r\nOur small army should always be kept in first-class condition, and\r\nevery attention should be paid to the National Guard; but neither on\r\nthe North nor the South have we neighbors capable of menacing us with\r\ninvasion or long resisting a serious effort on our part to invade them.\r\nThe enemies we may have to face will come from over sea; they may come\r\nfrom Europe, or they may come from Asia. Events move fast in the West;\r\nbut this generation has been forced to see that they move even faster\r\nin the oldest East. Our interests are as great in the Pacific as in the\r\nAtlantic, in the Hawaiian Islands as in the West Indies. Merely for the\r\nprotection of our own shores we need a great navy; and what is more,\r\nwe need it to protect our interests in the islands from which it is\r\npossible to command our shores and to protect our commerce on the high\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nIn building this navy, we must remember two things: First, that our\r\nships and guns should be the very best of their kind; and second,\r\nthat no matter how good they are, they will be useless unless the\r\nman in the conning tower and the man behind the guns are also the\r\nbest of their kind. It is mere folly to send men to perish because\r\nthey have arms with which they cannot win. With poor ships, were an\r\nAdmiral Nelson and Farragut rolled in one, he might be beaten by any\r\nfirst-class fleet; and he surely would be beaten if his opponents were\r\nin any degree his equals in skill and courage; but without this skill\r\nand courage no perfection of material can avail, and with them very\r\ngrave shortcomings in equipment may be overcome. The men who command\r\nour ships must have as perfect weapons ready to their hands as can be\r\nfound in the civilized world, and they must be trained to the highest\r\npoint in using them. They must have skill in handling the ships, skill\r\nin tactics, skill in strategy, for ignorant courage can not avail; but\r\nwithout courage neither will skill avail. They must have in them the\r\ndogged ability to bear punishment, the power and desire to inflict it,\r\nthe daring, the resolution, the willingness to take risks and incur\r\nresponsibility which have been possessed by the great captains of all\r\nages, and without which no man can ever hope to stand in the front rank\r\nof fighting men.\r\n\r\nTame submission to foreign aggression of any kind is a mean and\r\nunworthy thing; but it is even meaner and more unworthy to bluster\r\nfirst, and then either submit or else refuse to make those preparations\r\nwhich can alone obviate the necessity for submission. I believe with\r\nall my heart in the Monroe Doctrine, and, I believe also that the great\r\nmass of the American people are loyal to it; but it is worse than idle\r\nto announce our adherence to this doctrine and yet to decline to take\r\nmeasures to show that ours is not mere lip loyalty. We had far better\r\nsubmit to interference by foreign powers with the affairs of this\r\ncontinent than to announce that we will not tolerate such interference,\r\nand yet refuse to make ready the means by which alone we can prevent\r\nit. In public as in private life, a bold front tends to insure peace\r\nand not strife. If we possess a formidable navy, small is the chance\r\nindeed that we shall ever be dragged into a war to uphold the Monroe\r\nDoctrine. If we do not possess such a navy, war may be forced on us at\r\nany time.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, then, that we need a first-class navy. It is equally\r\ncertain that this should not be merely a navy for defense. Our chief\r\nharbors should, of course, be fortified and put in condition to\r\nresist the attack of an enemy’s fleet; and one of our prime needs is\r\nan ample force of torpedo boats to use primarily for coast defense.\r\nBut in war the mere defensive never pays, and can never result in\r\nanything but disaster. It is not enough to parry a blow. The surest\r\nway to prevent its repetition is to return it. No master of the prize\r\nring ever fought his way to supremacy by mere dexterity in avoiding\r\npunishment. He had to win by inflicting punishment. If the enemy is\r\ngiven the choice of time and place to attack, sooner or later he will\r\ndo irreparable damage, and if he is at any point beaten back, why,\r\nafter all, it is merely a repulse, and there are no means of following\r\nit up and making it a rout. We cannot rely upon coast protection\r\nalone. Forts and heavy land guns and torpedo boats are indispensable,\r\nand the last, on occasion, may be used for offensive purposes also.\r\nBut in the present state of naval and military knowledge we must rely\r\nmainly, as all great nations always have relied, on the battle-ship,\r\nthe fighting ship of the line. Gunboats and light cruisers serve an\r\nexcellent purpose, and we could not do without them. In time of peace\r\nthey are the police of the seas; in time of war they would do some\r\nharrying of commerce, and a great deal of scouting and skirmishing; but\r\nour main reliance must be on the great armored battle-ships with their\r\nheavy guns and shot-proof vitals. In the last resort we most trust to\r\nthe ships whose business it is to fight and not to run, and who can\r\nthemselves go to sea and strike at the enemy when they choose, instead\r\nof waiting peacefully to receive his blow when and where he deems it\r\nbest to deliver it. If in the event of war our fleet of battle-ships\r\ncan destroy the hostile fleet, then our coasts are safe from the menace\r\nof serious attack; even a fight that ruined our fleet would probably so\r\nshatter the hostile fleet as to do away with all chance of invasion;\r\nbut if we have no fleet wherewith to meet the enemy on the high seas,\r\nor to anticipate his stroke by our own, then every city within reach of\r\nthe tides must spend men and money in preparation for an attack that\r\nmay not come, but which would cause crushing and irredeemable disaster\r\nif it did come.\r\n\r\nStill more is it necessary to have a fleet of great battle-ships if\r\nwe intend to live up to the Monroe Doctrine, and to insist upon its\r\nobservance in the two Americas and the islands on either side of them.\r\nIf a foreign power, whether in Europe or Asia, should determine to\r\nassert its position in those lands wherein we feel that our influence\r\nshould be supreme, there is but one way in which we can effectively\r\ninterfere. Diplomacy is utterly useless where there is no force behind\r\nit; the diplomat is the servant, not the master, of the soldier. The\r\nprosperity of peace, commercial and material prosperity, gives no\r\nweight whatever when the clash of arms comes. Even great naked strength\r\nis useless if there is no immediate means through which that strength\r\ncan manifest itself. If we mean to protect the people of the lands who\r\nlook to us for protection from tyranny and aggression; if we mean to\r\nuphold our interests in the teeth of the formidable Old World powers,\r\nwe can only do it by being ready at any time, if the provocation, is\r\nsufficient, to meet them on the seas, where the battle for supremacy\r\nmust be fought. Unless we are prepared so to meet them, let us abandon\r\nall talk of devotion to the Monroe Doctrine or to the honor of the\r\nAmerican name.\r\n\r\nThis nation cannot stand still if it is to retain its self-respect, and\r\nto keep undimmed the honorable traditions inherited from the men who\r\nwith the sword founded it and by the sword preserved it. We ask that\r\nthe work of upbuilding the Navy, and of putting the United States where\r\nit should be put among maritime powers, go forward without a break.\r\nWe ask this not in the interest of war, but in the interest of peace.\r\nNo nation should ever wage war wantonly, but no nation should ever\r\navoid it at the cost of the loss of national honor. A nation should\r\nnever fight unless forced to; but it should always be ready to fight.\r\nThe mere fact that it is ready will generally spare it the necessity\r\nof fighting. If this country now had a fleet of twenty battle-ships\r\ntheir existence would make it all the more likely that we should not\r\nhave war. It is very important that we should, as a race, keep the\r\nvirile fighting qualities and should be ready to use them at need;\r\nbut it is not at all important to use them unless there is need. One\r\nof the surest ways to attain these qualities is to keep our Navy in\r\nfirst-class trim. There never is, and never has been, on our part a\r\ndesire to use a weapon because of its being well-tempered. There is not\r\nthe least danger that the possession of a good navy will render this\r\ncountry overbearing toward its neighbors. The direct contrary is the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nAn unmanly desire to avoid a quarrel is often the surest way to\r\nprecipitate one; and utter unreadiness to fight is even surer. If at\r\nthe time of our trouble with Chili, six years ago, we had not already\r\npossessed the nucleus of the new navy we should almost certainly have\r\nbeen forced into fighting, and even as it was trouble was only averted\r\nbecause of the resolute stand then taken by the President and by the\r\nofficers of the Navy who were on the spot. If at that time the Chilians\r\nhad been able to get ready the battle-ship which was building for them,\r\na war would almost certainly have followed, for we had no battle-ship\r\nto put against it.\r\n\r\nIf in the future we have war, it will almost certainly come because of\r\nsome action, or lack of action, on our part in the way of refusing to\r\naccept responsibilities at the proper time, or failing to prepare for\r\nwar when war does not threaten. An ignoble peace is even worse than\r\nan unsuccessful war; but an unsuccessful war would leave behind it a\r\nlegacy of bitter memories which would hurt our national development for\r\na generation to come. It is true that no nation could actually conquer\r\nus, owing to our isolated position; but we would be seriously harmed,\r\neven materially, by disasters that stopped far short of conquest; and\r\nin these matters, which are far more important than things material,\r\nwe could readily be damaged beyond repair. No material loss can begin\r\nto compensate for the loss of national self-respect. The damage to our\r\ncommercial interests by the destruction of one of our coast cities\r\nwould be as nothing compared to the humiliation which would be felt by\r\nevery American worthy of the name if we had to submit to such an injury\r\nwithout amply avenging it. It has been finely said that “a gentleman\r\nis one who is willing to lay down his life for little things”; that is\r\nfor those things which seem little to the man who cares only whether\r\nshares rise or fall in value, and to the timid _doctrinaire_ who\r\npreaches timid peace from his cloistered study.\r\n\r\nMuch of that which is best and highest in national character is made\r\nup of glorious memories and traditions. The fight well fought, the\r\nlife honorably lived, the death bravely met--those count for more\r\nin building a high and fine type of temper in a nation than any\r\npossible success in the stock market, than any possible prosperity in\r\ncommerce or manufactures. A rich banker may be a valuable and useful\r\ncitizen, but not a thousand rich bankers can leave to the country\r\nsuch a heritage as Farragut left, when, lashed in the rigging of\r\nthe _Hartford_, he forged past the forts and over the unseen death\r\nbelow, to try his wooden stem against the ironclad hull of the great\r\nConfederate ram. The people of some given section of our country may\r\nbe better off because a shrewd and wealthy man has built up therein a\r\ngreat manufacturing business, or has extended a line of railroad past\r\nits doors; but the whole nation is better, the whole nation is braver,\r\nbecause Cushing pushed his little torpedo-boat through the darkness to\r\nsink beside the sinking _Albemarle_.\r\n\r\nEvery feat of heroism makes us forever indebted to the man who\r\nperformed it. All daring and courage, all iron endurance of misfortune,\r\nall devotion to the ideal of honor and the glory of the flag, make for\r\na finer and nobler type of manhood. It is not only those who do and\r\ndare and endure that are benefited; but also the countless thousands\r\nwho are not themselves called upon to face the peril, to show the\r\nstrength, or to win the reward. All of us lift our heads higher because\r\nthose of our countrymen whose trade it is to meet danger have met it\r\nwell and bravely. All of us are poorer for every base or ignoble deed\r\ndone by an American, for every instance of selfishness or weakness or\r\nfolly on the part of the people as a whole. We are all worse off when\r\nany of us fails at any point in his duty toward the State in time of\r\npeace, or his duty toward the State in time of war. If ever we had to\r\nmeet defeat at the hands of a foreign foe, or had to submit tamely to\r\nwrong or insult, every man among us worthy of the name of American\r\nwould feel dishonored and debased. On the other hand, the memory of\r\nevery triumph won by Americans, by just so much helps to make each\r\nAmerican nobler and better. Every man among us is more fit to meet the\r\nduties and responsibilities of citizenship because of the perils over\r\nwhich, in the past, the nation has triumphed; because of the blood\r\nand sweat and tears, the labor and the anguish, through which, in the\r\ndays that have gone, our forefathers moved on to triumph. There are\r\nhigher things in this life than the soft and easy enjoyment of material\r\ncomfort. It is through strife, or the readiness for strife, that a\r\nnation must win greatness. We ask for a great navy, partly because\r\nwe think that the possession of such a navy is the surest guaranty\r\nof peace, and partly because we feel that no national life is worth\r\nhaving if the nation is not willing, when the need shall arise, to\r\nstake everything on the supreme arbitrament of war, and to pour out its\r\nblood, its treasure, and its tears like water, rather than submit to\r\nthe loss of honor and renown.\r\n\r\nIn closing, let me repeat that we ask for a great navy, we ask for an\r\narmament fit for the nation’s needs, not primarily to fight, but to\r\navert fighting. Preparedness deters the foe, and maintains right by the\r\nshow of ready might without the use of violence. Peace, like freedom,\r\nis not a gift that tarries long in the hands of cowards, or of those\r\ntoo feeble or too short-sighted to deserve it; and we ask to be given\r\nthe means to insure that honorable peace which alone is worth having.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] Address as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, before the Naval War\r\nCollege, June, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII\r\n\r\n                    NATIONAL LIFE AND CHARACTER[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _National Life and Character; a Forecast_, Mr. Charles H. Pearson,\r\nlate fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and sometime Minister of\r\nEducation in Victoria, has produced one of the most notable books of\r\nthe end of the century. Mr. Pearson is not always quite so careful as\r\nhe might be about his facts; many of the conclusions he draws from them\r\nseem somewhat strained; and with much of his forecast most of us would\r\nradically disagree. Nevertheless, no one can read this book without\r\nfeeling his thinking powers greatly stimulated; without being forced to\r\nponder problems of which he was previously wholly ignorant, or which he\r\nbut half understood; and without realizing that he is dealing with the\r\nwork of a man of lofty thought and of deep and philosophic insight into\r\nthe world-forces of the present.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson belongs to the melancholy or pessimist school, which has\r\nbecome so prominent in England during the last two or three decades,\r\nand which has been represented there for half a century. In fact, the\r\nnote of despondency seems to be the dominant note among Englishmen\r\nof high cultivation at the present time. It is as marked among their\r\nstatesmen and publicists as among their men of letters, Mr. Balfour\r\nbeing particularly happy in his capacity to express in good English,\r\nand with much genuine elevation of thought, a profound disbelief in\r\nnineteenth century progress, and an equally profound distrust of the\r\nfuture toward which we are all travelling.\r\n\r\nFor much of this pessimism and for many of the prophecies which it\r\nevokes, there is no excuse whatsoever. There may possibly be good\r\nfoundation for the pessimism as to the future shown by men like Mr.\r\nPearson; but hitherto the writers of the stamp of the late “Cassandra”\r\nGreg who have been pessimistic about the present, have merely betrayed\r\ntheir own weakness or their own incapacity to judge contemporary\r\npersons and events. The weakling, the man who cannot struggle with\r\nhis fellow-men and with the conditions that surround him, is very apt\r\nto think these men and these conditions bad; and if he has the gift\r\nof writing, he puts these thoughts down at some length on paper. Very\r\nstrong men, moreover, if of morose and dyspeptic temper, are apt to\r\nrail at the present, and to praise the past simply because they do not\r\nlive in it. To any man who will consider the subject from a scientific\r\npoint of view, with a desire to get at the truth, it is needless to\r\ninsist on the fact that at no period of the world’s history has there\r\nbeen so much happiness generally diffused among mankind as now.\r\n\r\nAt no period of the world’s history has life been so full of interest\r\nand of possibilities of excitement and enjoyment as for us who live\r\nin the latter half of the nineteenth century. This is not only true\r\nas far as the working classes are concerned, but it is especially\r\ntrue as regards the men of means, and above all of those men of means\r\nwho also possess brains and ambition. Never before in the world’s\r\nhistory have there been such opportunities thrown open to men, in\r\nthe way of building new commonwealths, exploring new countries,\r\nconquering kingdoms, and trying to adapt the governmental policy of\r\nold nations to new and strange conditions. The half-century which is\r\nnow closing, has held out to the people who have dwelt therein, some\r\nof the great prizes of history. Abraham Lincoln and Prince Bismarck\r\nhave taken their places among the world’s worthies. Mighty masters\r\nof war have arisen in America, in Germany, in Russia; Lee and Grant,\r\nJackson and Farragut, Moltke, Skobeleff, and the Red Prince. The work\r\nof the chiefs of mechanical and electrical invention has never been\r\nequalled before, save perhaps by what was done in the first half of\r\nthis same century. Never before have there been so many opportunities\r\nfor commonwealth builders; new States have been pitched on the banks\r\nof the Saskatchewan, the Columbia, the Missouri, and the Colorado, on\r\nthe seacoast of Australia, and in the interior of Central Africa.\r\nVast regions have been won by the sword. Burmah and Turkestan, Egypt\r\nand Matabeleland, have rewarded the prowess of English and Russian\r\nconquerors, exactly as, when the glory of Rome was at its height,\r\nremote Mediterranean provinces furnished triumphs to the great military\r\nleaders of the Eternal City. English administrators govern subject\r\nempires larger than those conquered by Alexander. In letters no name\r\nhas been produced that will stand with the first half-dozen of all\r\nliterature, but there have been very many borne by men whose effect\r\nupon the literatures of their own countries has been profound, and\r\nwhose works will last as long as the works of any men written in the\r\nsame tongues. In science even more has been done; Darwin has fairly\r\nrevolutionized thought; and many others stand but a step below him.\r\n\r\nAll this means only that the opportunities have been exceptionally\r\ngreat for the men of exceptionally great powers; but they have also\r\nbeen great for the men of ordinary powers. The workingman is, on\r\nthe whole, better fed, better clothed, better housed, and provided\r\nwith greater opportunities for pleasure and for mental and spiritual\r\nimprovement than ever before. The man with ability enough to become a\r\nlawmaker has the fearful joy of grappling with problems as important\r\nas any the administrators and legislators of the past had to face.\r\nThe ordinary man of adventurous tastes and a desire to get all out\r\nof life that can be gotten, is beyond measure better off than were\r\nhis forefathers of one, two, or three centuries back. He can travel\r\nround the world; he can dwell in any country he wishes; he can explore\r\nstrange regions; he can spend years by himself in the wilderness,\r\nhunting great game; he can take part in a campaign here and there.\r\nWithersoever his tastes lead him, he finds that he has far greater\r\ncapacity conferred upon him by the conditions of nineteenth-century\r\ncivilization to do something of note than ever a man of his kind had\r\nbefore. If he is observant, he notes all around him the play of vaster\r\nforces than have ever before been exerted, working, half blindly, half\r\nunder control, to bring about immeasurable results. He sees going\r\non before his eyes a great transfer of population and civilization,\r\nwhich is making America north of the Rio Grande, and Australia,\r\nEnglish-speaking continents; which has filled Central and South America\r\nwith States of uncertain possibilities; which is creating for the first\r\ntime a huge Aryan nation across the entire north of Asia, and which\r\nis working changes in Africa infinitely surpassing in importance all\r\nthose that have ever taken place there since the days when the Bantu\r\npeoples first built their beehive huts on the banks of the Congo and\r\nthe Zambezi. Our century has teemed with life and interest.\r\n\r\nYet this is the very century at which Carlyle railed: and it is strange\r\nto think that he could speak of the men at that very moment engaged\r\nin doing such deeds, as belonging to a worn-out age. His vision was\r\nclear to see the importance and the true bearing of England’s civil\r\nwar of the seventeenth century, and yet he remained mole-blind to\r\nthe vaster and more important civil war waged before his very eyes\r\nin nineteenth-century America. The heroism of Naseby and Worcester\r\nand Minden hid from him the heroism of Balaklava and Inkerman, of\r\nLucknow and Delhi. He could appreciate at their worth the campaigns\r\nof the Seven Year’s War, and yet could hardly understand those waged\r\nbetween the armies of the Potomac and of Northern Virginia. He was\r\nfairly inspired by the fury and agony and terror of the struggle\r\nat Kunnersdorf; and yet could not appreciate the immensely greater\r\nimportance of the death-wrestle that reeled round Gettysburg. His eyes\r\nwere so dazzled by the great dramas of the past that he could not see\r\nthe even greater drama of the present. It is but the bare truth to say\r\nthat never have the rewards been greater, never has there been more\r\nchance for doing work of great and lasting value, than this last half\r\nof the nineteenth century has offered alike to statesman and soldier,\r\nto explorer and commonwealth-builder, to the captain of industry, to\r\nthe man of letters, and to the man of science. Never has life been more\r\ninteresting to each to take part in. Never has there been a greater\r\noutput of good work done both by the few and by the many.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, signs do not fail that we are on the eve of great\r\nchanges, and that in the next century we shall see the conditions of\r\nour lives, national and individual, modified after a sweeping and\r\nradical fashion. Many of the forces that make for national greatness\r\nand for individual happiness in the nineteenth century will be\r\nabsent entirely, or will act with greatly diminished strength, in the\r\ntwentieth. Many of the forces that now make for evil will by that time\r\nhave gained greatly in volume and power. It is foolish to look at the\r\nfuture with blind and careless optimism; quite as foolish as to gaze\r\nat it only through the dun-colored mists that surround the preachers\r\nof pessimism. It is always best to look facts squarely in the face,\r\nwithout blinking them, and to remember that, as has been well said, in\r\nthe long run even the most uncomfortable truth is a safer companion\r\nthan the pleasantest falsehood.\r\n\r\nWhether the future holds good or evil for us does not, it is true,\r\nalter our duty in the present. We must stand up valiantly in the fight\r\nfor righteousness and wisdom as we see them, and must let the event\r\nturn out as it may. Nevertheless, even though there is little use in\r\npondering over the future, most men of intelligence do ponder over it\r\nat times, and if we think of it at all, it is well to think clearly.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson writes a forecast of what he believes probably will, or at\r\nleast very possibly may, happen in the development of national life\r\nand character during the era upon which we are now entering. He is a\r\nman who has had exceptional advantages for his work; he has studied\r\ndeeply and travelled widely; he has been a diligent reader of books and\r\na keen observer of men. To a careful training in one of the oldest of\r\nthe world’s universities he has added long experience as an executive\r\nofficer in one of the world’s youngest commonwealths. He writes with\r\npower and charm. His book is interesting in manner, and is still more\r\ninteresting in matter, for he has thought deeply and faithfully over\r\nsubjects of immense importance to the future of all the human race. He\r\npossesses a mind of marked originality. Moreover, he always faithfully\r\ntries to see facts as they actually are. He is, it seems to me, unduly\r\npessimistic; but he is not pessimistic of set purpose, nor does he\r\nadopt pessimism as a cult. He tries hard, and often successfully, to\r\nmake himself see and to make himself state forces that are working for\r\ngood. We may or may not differ from him, but it behooves us, if we do,\r\nto state our positions guardedly; for we are dealing with a man who has\r\ndisplayed much research in getting at his facts and much honesty in\r\narriving at his rather melancholy conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to Mr. Pearson’s book is as readable as the chapters\r\nthat follow, and may best be considered in connection with the first\r\nof these chapters, which is entitled “The Unchangeable Limits of the\r\nHigher Races.” I am almost tempted to call this the most interesting\r\nof the six chapters of the book, and yet one can hardly do so when\r\nabsorbed in reading any one of the other five. Mr. Pearson sees what\r\nought to be evident to every one, but apparently is not, that what\r\nhe calls the “higher races,” that is, the races that for the last\r\ntwenty-five hundred years (but, it must be remembered, only during the\r\nlast twenty-five hundred years) have led the world, can prosper only\r\nunder conditions of soil and climate analogous to those obtaining in\r\ntheir old European homes. Speaking roughly, this means that they can\r\nprosper only in the temperate zones, north and south.\r\n\r\nFour hundred years ago the temperate zones, were very thinly peopled\r\nindeed, while the tropical and sub-tropical regions were already\r\ndensely populated. The great feature in the world’s history for the\r\nlast four centuries has been the peopling of these vast, scantily\r\ninhabited regions by men of the European stocks; notably by men\r\nspeaking English, but also by men speaking Russian and Spanish. During\r\nthe same centuries these European peoples have for the first time\r\nacquired an enormous ascendency over all other races. Once before,\r\nduring the days of the Greco-Macedonian and Roman supremacy, European\r\npeoples possessed a somewhat similar supremacy; but it was not nearly\r\nas great, for at that period America and Australia were unknown, Africa\r\nsouth of the Sahara was absolutely unaffected by either Roman or Greek,\r\nand all but an insignificant portion of Asia was not only without the\r\npale of European influence, but held within itself immense powers of\r\nmenace to Europe, and contained old and peculiar civilizations, still\r\nflourishing in their prime. All this has now been changed. Great\r\nEnglish-speaking nations have sprung up in America north of the Rio\r\nGrande, and are springing up in Australia. The Russians, by a movement\r\nwhich has not yet fired the popular imagination, but which all thinking\r\nmen recognize as of incalculable importance, are building a vast\r\nState in northern Asia, stretching from the Yellow Sea to the Ural\r\nMountains. Tropical America is parcelled out among States partly of\r\nEuropean blood, and mainly European in thought, speech and religion;\r\nwhile tropical Asia and Africa have been divided among European powers,\r\nand are held in more or less complete subjection by their military\r\nand civil agents. It is no wonder that men who are content to look\r\nat things superficially, and who think that the tendencies that have\r\ntriumphed during the last two centuries are as immutable in their\r\nworkings as great natural laws, should speak as if it were a mere\r\nquestion of time when the civilized peoples should overrun and occupy\r\nthe entire world, exactly as they now do Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson points out with great clearness the groundlessness of\r\nthis belief. He deserves especial praise for discriminating between\r\nthe importance of ethnic, and of merely political, conquests. The\r\nconquest by one country of another populous country always attracts\r\ngreat attention at the time, and has wide momentary effects; but it\r\nis of insignificant importance when compared with the kind of armed\r\nsettlement which causes new nations of an old stock to spring up in new\r\ncountries. The campaigns carried on by the lieutenants of Justinian\r\nagainst Goth and Vandal, Bulgarian and Persian, seemed in the eyes\r\nof civilized Europe at that time of incalculably greater moment than\r\nthe squalid warfare being waged in England between the descendants of\r\nLow Dutch sea-thieves and the aboriginal British. Yet, in reality,\r\nit was of hardly any consequence in history whether Belisarius did or\r\ndid not succeed in overthrowing the Ostrogoth merely to make room for\r\nthe Lombard, or whether the Vandal did or did not succumb to the Roman\r\ninstead of succumbing to the Saracen a couple of centuries later; while\r\nit was of the most vital consequence to the whole future of the world\r\nthat the English should supplant the Welsh as masters of Britain.\r\n\r\nAgain, in our own day, the histories written of Great Britain during\r\nthe last century teem with her dealings with India, while Australia\r\nplays a very insignificant part indeed; yet, from the standpoint of\r\nthe ages, the peopling of the great island-continent with men of the\r\nEnglish stock is a thousand fold more important than the holding\r\nHindoostan for a few centuries.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson understands and brings out clearly that in the long\r\nrun a conquest must fail when it means merely the erection of an\r\ninsignificant governing caste. He shows clearly that the men of our\r\nstock do not prosper in tropical countries. In the New World they leave\r\na thin strain of their blood among and impose their laws, language,\r\nand forms of government on the aboriginal races, which then develop on\r\nnew and dimly drawn lines. In the Old World they fail to do even this.\r\nIn Asia they may leave a few tens of thousands or possibly hundreds of\r\nthousands of Eurasians to form an additional caste in a caste-ridden\r\ncommunity. In tropical Africa they may leave here and there a mulatto\r\ntribe like the Griquas. But it certainly has not yet been proved that\r\nthe European can live and propagate permanently in the hot regions of\r\nIndia and Africa, and Mr. Pearson is right in anticipating for the\r\nwhites who have conquered these tropical and sub-tropical regions\r\nof the Old World, the same fate which befell the Greek kingdoms in\r\nBactria and the Chersonese. The Greek rulers of Bactria were ultimately\r\nabsorbed and vanished, as probably the English rulers of India will\r\nsome day in the future--for the good of mankind, we sincerely hope and\r\nbelieve the very remote future--themselves be absorbed and vanish.\r\nIn Africa south of the Zambezi (and possibly here and there on high\r\nplateaus north of it,) there may remain white States, although even\r\nthese States will surely contain a large colored population, always\r\nthreatening to swamp the whites; but in tropical Africa generally,\r\nit does not seem possible that any white State can ever be built up.\r\nDoubtless for many centuries European adventurers and Arab raiders\r\nwill rule over huge territories in the country south of the Soudan\r\nand north of the Tropic of Capricorn, and the whole structure, not\r\nonly social, but physical, of the negro and the negroid peoples will\r\nbe profoundly changed by their influence and by the influence of the\r\nhalf-caste descendants of these European and Asiatic soldiers of\r\nfortune and industry. But it is hardly possible to conceive that the\r\npeoples of Africa, however ultimately changed, will be anything but\r\nnegroid in type of body and mind. It is probable that the change will\r\nbe in the direction of turning them into tribes like those of the\r\nSoudan, with a similar religion and morality. It is almost impossible\r\nthat they will not in the end succeed in throwing off the yoke of the\r\nEuropean outsiders, though this end may be, and we hope will be, many\r\ncenturies distant. In America, most of the West Indies are becoming\r\nnegro islands. The Spaniard, however, because of the ease with which he\r\ndrops to a lower ethnic level, exerts a much more permanent influence\r\nthan the Englishman upon tropic aboriginal races; and the tropical\r\nlands which the Spaniards and Portuguese once held, now contain, and\r\nalways will contain, races which, though different from the Aryan of\r\nthe temperate zone, yet bridge the gulf between him and the black, red,\r\nand yellow peoples who have dwelt from time immemorial on both sides of\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\nTaking all this into consideration, therefore, it is most likely that a\r\nportion of Mr. Pearson’s forecast, as regards the people of the tropic\r\nzones, will be justified by events. It is impossible for the dominant\r\nraces of the temperate zones ever bodily to displace the peoples of\r\nthe tropics. It is highly probable that these people will cast off the\r\nyoke of their European conquerors sooner or later, and will become\r\nindependent nations once more; though it is also possible that the\r\nmodern conditions of easy travel may permit the permanent rule in the\r\ntropics of a vigorous northern race, renewed by a complete change every\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson’s further proposition is that these black, red, and yellow\r\nnations, when thus freed, will threaten the dominance of the higher\r\npeoples, possibly by military, certainly by industrial, rivalry, and\r\nthat the mere knowledge of the equality of these stocks will cow and\r\ndispirit the higher races.\r\n\r\nThis part of his argument is open to very serious objections. In the\r\nfirst place, Mr. Pearson entirely fails to take into account the\r\ndifference in character among the nationalities produced in the tropics\r\nas the result of European conquest. In Asia, doubtless, the old races\r\nnow submerged by European predominance will reappear, profoundly\r\nchanged in themselves and in their relations to one another, but as\r\nun-European as ever, and not appreciably affected by any intermixture\r\nof European blood. In Africa, the native States will probably range\r\nsomewhere between the Portuguese half-caste and quarter-caste\r\ncommunities now existing on certain of the tropic coasts, and pastoral\r\nor agricultural communities, with a Mohammedan religious cult and\r\nAsiatic type of government, produced by the infusion of a conquering\r\nsemitic or hamitic caste on a conquered negro people. There may be a\r\ndominant caste of European blood in some of these States, but that\r\nis all. In tropical America, the change has already taken place.\r\nThe States that there exist will not materially alter their form.\r\nIt is possible that here and there populations of Chinese, pure or\r\nhalf-caste, or even of coolies, may spring up; but taken as a whole,\r\nthese States will be in the future what they are now, that is, they\r\nwill be by blood partly white, but chiefly Indian or negro, with\r\ntheir language, law, religion, literature, and governmental system\r\napproaching those of Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nSuppose that what Mr. Pearson foresees comes to pass, and that the\r\nblack and yellow races of the world attain the same independence\r\nalready achieved by the mongrel reddish race. Mr. Pearson thinks\r\nthat this will expose us to two dangers. The first is that of actual\r\nphysical distress caused by the competition of the teeming myriads\r\nof the tropics, or perhaps by their invasion of the Temperate zones.\r\nMr. Pearson himself does not feel any very great anxiety about this\r\ninvasion assuming a military type, and I think that even the fear he\r\ndoes express is unwarranted by the facts. He is immensely impressed by\r\nthe teeming population of China. He thinks that the Chinese will some\r\nday constitute the dominant portion of the population, both politically\r\nand numerically, in the East Indies, New Guinea, and Farther India. In\r\nthis he is probably quite right; but such a change would merely mean\r\nthe destruction or submersion of Malay, Dyak, and Papuan and would be\r\nof hardly any real consequence to the white man. He further thinks\r\nthat the Chinese may jeopardize Russia in Asia. Here I am inclined to\r\nthink he is wrong. As far as it is possible to judge in the absence of\r\nstatistics, the Chinaman at present is not increasing relatively as\r\nfast as the Slav and the Anglo-Saxon. Half a century or so more will\r\nput both of them within measurable distance of equality with him, even\r\nin point of numbers. The movement of population in China is toward the\r\nsouth, not the north; the menace is real for the English and French\r\nprotectorates in the south; in the north the difficulty hitherto has\r\nbeen to keep Russian settlers from crossing the Chinese frontier. When\r\nthe great Trans-Siberian railroad is built, and when a few millions\r\nmore of Russian settlers stretch from the Volga to the valley of the\r\nAmoor, the danger of a military advance by the Chinese against Asiatic\r\nRussia will be entirely over, even granting that it now exists. The\r\nChinaman never has been, and probably never will be, such a fighter as\r\nTurk or Tartar, and he would have to possess an absolutely overwhelming\r\nsuperiority of numbers to give him a chance in a war of aggression\r\nagainst a powerful military race. As yet, he has made no advance\r\nwhatever towards developing an army capable of offensive work against\r\nEuropean foes. In China there are no roads; the military profession\r\nis looked down on; Chinese troops would be formidable only under a\r\nEuropean leader, and a European leader would be employed only from dire\r\nnecessity; that is to repel, not to undertake an invasion. Moreover,\r\nChina is merely an aggregate of provinces with a central knot at Pekin;\r\nand Pekin could be taken at any time by a small trained army. China\r\nwill not menace Siberia until after undergoing some stupendous and\r\nundreamed-of internal revolution. It is scarcely within the bounds of\r\npossibility to conceive of the Chinaman expelling the European settler\r\nfrom lands in which that settler represents the bulk of a fairly thick\r\npopulation, not merely a small intrusive caste. It is, of course,\r\nalways possible that in the far-distant future (though there is no\r\nsign of it now) China may travel on the path of Japan, may change her\r\npolicy, may develop fleets and armies; but if she does do this, there\r\nis no reason why this fact should stunt and dwarf the people of the\r\nhigher races. In Elizabeth’s day the Turkish fleets and armies stood\r\ntowards those of European powers in a far higher position than those of\r\nChina, or of the tropics generally, can ever hope to stand in relation\r\nto the peoples of the Temperate zones; and yet this did not hinder\r\nthe Elizabethan Age from being one of great note both in the field of\r\nthought and in the field of action.\r\n\r\nThe anticipation of what might happen if India became solidified seems\r\neven more ill-founded. Here Mr. Pearson’s position is that the very\r\ncontinuance of European rule, doing away with war and famine, produces\r\nan increase of population and a solidity of the country, which will\r\nenable the people to overthrow that European rule. He assumes that the\r\nsolidified and populous country will continue to remain such after the\r\noverthrow of the Europeans, and will be capable of deeds of aggression;\r\nbut, of course, such an assumption is contrary to all probabilities.\r\nOnce the European rule was removed, famine and internecine war would\r\nagain become chronic, and India would sink back to her former place.\r\nMoreover, the long continuance of British rule undoubtedly weakens the\r\nwarlike fibre of the natives, and makes the usurer rather than the\r\nsoldier the dominant type.\r\n\r\nThe danger to which Mr. Pearson alludes, that even the negro peoples\r\nmay in time become vast military powers, constituting a menace to\r\nEurope, really seems to belong to a period so remote that every\r\ncondition will have changed to a degree rendering it impossible for us\r\nto make any estimate in reference thereto. By that time the descendant\r\nof the negro may be as intellectual as the Athenian. Even prophecy must\r\nnot look too many thousand years ahead. It is perfectly possible that\r\nEuropean settlements in Africa will be swamped some time by the rising\r\nof natives who outnumber them a hundred or a thousand to one, but it is\r\nnot possible that the negroes will form a military menace to the people\r\nof the north, at least for a space of time longer than that which now\r\nseparates us from the men of the River Drift. The negroid peoples,\r\nthe so-called “hamatic,” and bastard semitic, races of eastern middle\r\nAfrica are formidable fighters; but their strength is not fit for any\r\nsuch herculean tasks.\r\n\r\nThere is much more reason to fear the industrial competition of these\r\nraces; but even this will be less formidable as the power of the State\r\nincreases and especially as the democratic idea obtains more and more\r\ncurrency. The Russians are not democratic at all, but the State is very\r\npowerful with them; and therefore they keep the Chinese out of their\r\nSiberian provinces, which are being rapidly filled up with a population\r\nmainly Slav, the remainder of which is being Slavicized. From the\r\nUnited States and Australia the Chinaman is kept out because the\r\ndemocracy, with much clearness of vision, has seen that his presence is\r\nruinous to the white race.\r\n\r\nNineteenth century democracy needs no more complete vindication for its\r\nexistence than the fact that it has kept for the white race the best\r\nportions of the new worlds’ surface, temperate America and Australia.\r\nHad these regions been under aristocratic governments, Chinese\r\nimmigration would have been encouraged precisely as the slave trade is\r\nencouraged of necessity by any slave-holding oligarchy, and the result\r\nwould in a few generations have been even more fatal to the white race;\r\nbut the democracy, with the clear instinct of race selfishness, saw the\r\nrace foe, and kept out the dangerous alien. The presence of the negro\r\nin our Southern States is a legacy from the time when we were ruled\r\nby a trans-oceanic aristocracy. The whole civilization of the future\r\nowes a debt of gratitude greater than can be expressed in words to that\r\ndemocratic policy which has kept the temperate zones of the new and the\r\nnewest worlds a heritage for the white people.\r\n\r\nAs for the industrial competition, the Chinaman and the Hindoo may\r\ndrive certain kinds of white traders from the tropics; but more than\r\nthis they cannot do. They can never change the status of the white\r\nlaborer in his own home, for the latter can always protect himself, and\r\nas soon as he is seriously menaced, always will protect himself, by\r\nprotective tariffs and stringent immigration laws.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson fears that when once the tropic races are independent, the\r\nwhite peoples will be humiliated and will lose heart: but this does not\r\nseem inevitable, and indeed seems very improbable. If the Englishman\r\nshould lose his control over South Africa and India, it might indeed be\r\na serious blow to the Englishman of Britain; though it may be well to\r\nremember that the generation of Englishmen which grew up immediately\r\nafter England had lost America, accomplished feats in arms, letters,\r\nand science such as, on the whole, no other English generation ever\r\naccomplished. Even granting that Britain were to suffer as Mr. Pearson\r\nthinks she would, the enormous majority of the English-speaking\r\npeoples, those whose homes are in America and Australia, would be\r\nabsolutely unaffected; and Continental Europe would be little more\r\naffected than it was when the Portuguese and Dutch successively saw\r\ntheir African and Indian empires diminish. France has not been affected\r\nby the expulsion of the French from Hayti; nor have the freed negroes\r\nof Hayti been capable of the smallest aggressive movement. No American\r\nor Australian cares in the least that the tan-colored peoples of Brazil\r\nand Ecuador now live under governments of their own instead of being\r\nruled by viceroys from Portugal and Spain; and it is difficult to see\r\nwhy they should be materially affected by a similar change happening in\r\nregard to the people along the Ganges or the upper Nile. Even if China\r\ndoes become a military power on the European model, this fact will\r\nhardly affect the American and Australian at the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury more than Japan’s effort to get admitted to the circle of\r\ncivilized nations has affected us at the end of the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be borne in mind that if any one of the tropical races\r\never does reach a pitch of industrial and military prosperity which\r\nmakes it a menace to European and American countries, it will almost\r\nnecessarily mean that this nation has itself become civilized in the\r\nprocess; and we shall then simply be dealing with another civilized\r\nnation of non-aryan blood, precisely as we now deal with Magyar, Fin,\r\nand Basque, without any thought of their being ethnically distinct from\r\nCroat, Rouman, or Wend.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Pearson’s second chapter he deals with the stationary order\r\nof society, and strives to show that while we are all tending toward\r\nit, some nations, notably France, have practically come to it. He\r\nadds that when this stationary state is reached, it will produce\r\ngeneral discouragement, and will probably affect the intellectual\r\nenergy of the people concerned. He further points out that our races\r\nnow tend to change from faith in private enterprises to faith in\r\nState organizations, and that this is likely to diminish the vigorous\r\noriginality of any race. He even holds that we already see the\r\nbeginning of a decadence, in the decline of speculative thought, and\r\nstill more in the way of mechanical inventions. It is perfectly true\r\nthat the _laissez-faire_ doctrine of the old school of political\r\neconomists is receiving, less and less favor; but after all, if we\r\nlook at events historically, we see that every race, as it has grown\r\nto civilized greatness, has used the power of the State more and more.\r\nA great State cannot rely on mere unrestricted individualism, any more\r\nthan it can afford to crush out all individualism. Within limits, the\r\nmercilessness of private commercial warfare must be curbed as we have\r\ncurbed the individual’s right of private war proper. It was not until\r\nthe power of the State had become great in England, and until the\r\nlawless individualism of feudal times had vanished, that the English\r\npeople began that career of greatness which has put them on a level\r\nwith the Greeks in point of intellectual achievement, and with the\r\nRomans in point of that material success which is measured by extension\r\nthrough settlement, by conquest, by triumphant warcraft and statecraft.\r\nAs for Mr. Pearson’s belief that we now see a decline in speculative\r\nthought and in mechanical invention, all that can be said is that the\r\nfacts do not bear him out.\r\n\r\nThere is one side to this stationary state theory which Mr. Pearson\r\nscarcely seems to touch. He points out with emphasis the fact, which\r\nmost people are prone to deny, that the higher orders of every society\r\ntend to die out; that there is a tendency, on the whole, for both lower\r\nclasses and lower civilizations to increase faster than the higher.\r\nTaken in the rough, his position on this point is undoubtedly correct.\r\nProgressive societies, and the most progressive portions of society,\r\nfail to increase as fast as the others, and often positively decrease.\r\nThe great commanders, great statesmen, great poets, great men of\r\nscience of any period taken together do not average as many children\r\nwho reach years of maturity as a similar number of mechanics, workmen,\r\nand farmers, taken at random. Nevertheless, society progresses,\r\nthe improvement being due mainly to the transmission of acquired\r\ncharacters, a process which in every civilized State operates so\r\nstrongly as to counterbalance the operation of that baleful law of\r\nnatural selection which tells against the survival of some of the most\r\ndesirable classes. Mr. Balfour, by the way, whose forecast for the race\r\nis in some respects not unlike Mr. Pearson’s, seems inclined to adopt\r\nthe view that acquired characteristics cannot be inherited; a position\r\nwhich, even though supported by a few eminent names, is hardly worthy\r\nserious refutation.\r\n\r\nThe point I wish to dwell upon here, however, is that it is precisely\r\nin those castes which have reached the stationary state, or which\r\nare positively diminishing in numbers, that the highest culture\r\nand best training, the keenest enjoyment of life, and the greatest\r\npower of doing good to the community, are to be found at present.\r\nUnquestionably, no community that is actually diminishing in numbers\r\nis in a healthy condition: and as the world is now, with huge waste\r\nplaces still to fill up, and with much of the competition between the\r\nraces reducing itself to the warfare of the cradle, no race has any\r\nchance to win a great place unless it consists of good breeders as well\r\nas of good fighters. But it may well be that these conditions will\r\nchange in the future, when the other changes to which Mr. Pearson looks\r\nforward with such melancholy, are themselves brought about. A nation\r\nsufficiently populous to be able to hold its own against aggression\r\nfrom without, a nation which, while developing the virtues of\r\nrefinement, culture, and learning, has yet not lost those of courage,\r\nbold initiative, and military hardihood, might well play a great part\r\nin the world, even though it had come to that stationary state already\r\nreached by the dominant castes of thinkers and doers in most of the\r\ndominant races.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Pearson’s third chapter he dwells on some of the dangers of\r\npolitical development, and in especial upon the increase of the town\r\nat the expense of the country, and upon the growth of great standing\r\narmies. Excessive urban development undoubtedly does constitute a real\r\nand great danger. All that can be said about it is that it is quite\r\nimpossible to prophesy how long this growth will continue. Moreover,\r\nsome of the evils, as far as they really exist, will cure themselves.\r\nIf towns-people do, generation by generation, tend to become stunted\r\nand weak, then they will die out, and the problem they cause will\r\nnot be permanent; while on the other hand, if the cities can be made\r\nhealthy, both physically and morally, the objections to them must\r\nlargely disappear. As for standing armies, Mr. Pearson here seems to\r\nhave too much thought of Europe only. In America and Australia there\r\nis no danger of the upgrowing of great standing armies: and, as he well\r\nshows, the fact that every citizen must undergo military training, is\r\nby no means altogether a curse to the nations of Continental Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is one point, by the way, although a small point, where it\r\nmay be worth while to correct Mr. Pearson’s statement of a fact.\r\nIn dwelling on what is undoubtedly the truth, that raw militia are\r\nutterly incompetent to make head against trained regular forces,\r\nhe finds it necessary to explain away the defeat at New Orleans.\r\nIn doing this, he repeats the story as it has been told by British\r\nhistorians from Sir Archibald Alison to Goldwin Smith. I hasten to\r\nsay that the misstatement is entirely natural on Mr. Pearson’s part;\r\nhe was simply copying, without sufficiently careful investigation,\r\nthe legend adopted by one side to take the sting out of defeat. The\r\nway he puts it is that six thousand British under Pakenham, without\r\nartillery, were hurled against strong works defended by twice their\r\nnumbers, and were beaten, as they would have been beaten had the works\r\nbeen defended by almost any troops in the world. In the first place,\r\nPakenham did not have six thousand men; he had almost ten thousand. In\r\nthe second place, the Americans, instead of being twice as numerous as\r\nthe British, were but little more than half as numerous. In the third\r\nplace, so far from being without artillery, the British were much\r\nsuperior to the Americans in this respect. Finally, they assailed a\r\nposition very much less strong than that held by Soult when Wellington\r\nbeat him at Toulouse with the same troops which were defeated by\r\nJackson at New Orleans. The simple truth is that Jackson was a very\r\ngood general, and that he had under him troops whom he had trained in\r\nsuccessive campaigns against Indians and Spaniards, and that on the\r\nthree occasions when he brought Pakenham to battle--that is, the night\r\nattack, the great artillery duel, and the open assault--the English\r\nsoldiers, though they fought with the utmost gallantry, were fairly and\r\ndecisively beaten.\r\n\r\nThis one badly-chosen premise does not, however, upset Mr. Pearson’s\r\nconclusions. Plenty of instances can be taken from our war of 1812 to\r\nshow how unable militia are to face trained regulars; and an equally\r\nstriking example was that afforded at Castlebar, in Ireland, in 1798,\r\nwhen a few hundred French regulars attacked with the bayonet and drove\r\nin headlong flight from a very strong position, defended by a powerful\r\nartillery, five times their number of English, Scotch, and Irish\r\nmilitia.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Pearson’s fourth chapter he deals, from a very noble standpoint,\r\nwith some advantages of national feeling. With this chapter and with\r\nhis praise of patriotism, and particularly of that patriotism which\r\nattaches itself to the whole country, and not to any section of it, we\r\ncan only express our hearty agreement.\r\n\r\nIn his fifth chapter, on “The Decline of the Family” he sets forth,\r\nor seems to set forth, certain propositions with which I must as\r\nheartily disagree. He seems to lament the change which is making the\r\nirresponsible despot as much of an anomaly in the family as in the\r\nState. He seems to think that this will weaken the family. It may do\r\nso, in some instances, exactly as the abolition of a despotism may\r\nproduce anarchy; but the movement is essentially as good in one case as\r\nin the other. To all who have known really happy family lives, that is\r\nto all who have known or have witnessed the greatest happiness which\r\nthere can be on this earth, it is hardly necessary to say that the\r\nhighest ideal of the family is attainable only where the father and\r\nmother stand to each other as lovers and friends, with equal rights.\r\nIn these homes the children are bound to father and mother by ties of\r\nlove, respect, and obedience, which are simply strengthened by the fact\r\nthat they are treated as reasonable beings with rights of their own,\r\nand that the rule of the household is changed to suit the changing\r\nyears, as childhood passes into manhood and womanhood. In such a home\r\nthe family is not weakened; it is strengthened. This is no unattainable\r\nideal. Every one knows hundreds of homes where it is more or less\r\nperfectly realized, and it is an ideal incomparably higher than the\r\nideal of the beneficent autocrat which it has so largely supplanted.\r\n\r\nThe final chapter of Mr. Pearson’s book is entitled “The Decay of\r\nCharacter.” He believes that our world is becoming a world with less\r\nadventure and energy, less brightness and hope. He believes that\r\nall the great books have been written, all the great discoveries\r\nmade, all the great deeds done. He thinks that the adoption of State\r\nsocialism in some form will crush out individual merit and the higher\r\nkinds of individual happiness. Of course, as to this, all that can\r\nbe said is that men differ as to what will be the effect of the\r\nforces whose working he portrays, and that most of us who live in the\r\nAmerican democracy do not agree with him. It is to the last degree\r\nimprobable that State socialism will ever be adopted in its extreme\r\nform, save in a few places. It exists, of course, to a certain extent\r\nwherever a police force and a fire department exist; and the sphere\r\nof the State’s action may be vastly increased without in any way\r\ndiminishing the happiness of either the many or the few. It is even\r\nconceivable that a combination of legislative enactments and natural\r\nforces may greatly reduce the inequalities of wealth without in any\r\nway diminishing the real power of enjoyment or power for good work of\r\nwhat are now the favored classes. In our own country the best work\r\nhas always been produced by men who lived in castes or social circles\r\nwhere the standard of essential comfort was high; that is, where men\r\nwere well clothed, well fed, well housed, and had plenty of books and\r\nthe opportunity of using them; but where there was small room for\r\nextravagant luxury. We think that Mr. Pearson’s fundamental error\r\nhere is his belief that the raising of the mass necessarily means\r\nthe lowering of the standard of life for the fortunate few. Those of\r\nus who now live in communities where the native American element is\r\nlargest and where there is least inequality of conditions, know well\r\nthat there is no reason whatever in the nature of things why, in the\r\nfuture, communities should not spring up where there shall be no great\r\nextremes of poverty and wealth, and where, nevertheless, the power of\r\ncivilization and the chances for happiness and for doing good work\r\nshall be greater than ever before.\r\n\r\nAs to what Mr. Pearson says about the work of the world which is best\r\nworth doing being now done, the facts do not bear him out. He thinks\r\nthat the great poems have all been written, that the days of the drama\r\nand the epic are past. Yet one of the greatest plays that has ever been\r\nproduced, always excepting the plays of Shakespeare, was produced in\r\nthis century; and if the world had to wait nearly two thousand years\r\nafter the vanishing of the Athenian dramatists before Shakespeare\r\nappeared, and two hundred years more before Goethe wrote his one great\r\nplay, we can well afford to suspend judgment for a few hundred years\r\nat least, before asserting that no country and no language will again\r\nproduce another great drama. So it is with the epic. We are too near\r\nMilton, who came three thousand years after Homer, to assert that the\r\ncenturies to come will never more see an epic. One race may grow feeble\r\nand decrepit and be unable to do any more work; but another may take\r\nits place. After a time the Greek and Latin writers found that they\r\nhad no more to say; and a critic belonging to either nationality might\r\nhave shaken his head and said that all the great themes had been used\r\nup and all the great ideas expressed; nevertheless, Dante, Cervantes,\r\nMolière, Schiller, Chaucer, and Scott, then all lay in the future.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Pearson speaks of statecraft at the present day as offering\r\nfewer prizes, and prizes of less worth than formerly, and as giving no\r\nchance for the development of men like Augustus Cæsar, Richelieu, or\r\nChatham. It is difficult to perceive how these men can be considered\r\nto belong to a different class from Bismarck, who is yet alive; nor do\r\nwe see why any English-speaking people should regard a statesman like\r\nChatham, or far greater that Chatham, as an impossibility nowadays or\r\nin the future. We Americans at least will with difficulty be persuaded\r\nthat there has ever been a time when a nobler prize of achievement,\r\nsuffering, and success was offered to any statesman than was offered\r\nboth to Washington and to Lincoln. So, when Mr. Pearson speaks of the\r\nwarfare of civilized countries offering less chance to the individual\r\nthan the warfare of savage and barbarous times, and of its being far\r\nless possible now than in old days for a man to make his personal\r\ninfluence felt in warfare, we can only express our disagreement. No\r\nworld-conqueror can arise save in or next to highly civilized States.\r\nThere never has been a barbarian Alexander or Cæsar, Hannibal or\r\nNapoleon. Sitting Bull and Rain-in-the-Face compare but ill with Von\r\nMoltke; and no Norse king of all the heroic viking age even so much as\r\nbegan to exercise the influence upon the warfare of his generation\r\nthat Frederick the Great exercised on his.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that character of necessity decays with the growth of\r\ncivilization. It may, of course, be true in some cases. Civilization\r\nmay tend to develop upon the lines of Byzantine, Hindoo, and Inca; and\r\nthere are sections of Europe and sections of the United States where we\r\nnow tend to pay heed exclusively to the peaceful virtues and to develop\r\nonly a race of merchants, lawyers, and professors, who will lack the\r\nvirile qualities that have made our race great and splendid. This\r\ndevelopment may come, but it need not come necessarily, and, on the\r\nwhole, the probabilities are against its coming at all.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson is essentially a man of strength and courage. Looking into\r\nthe future, the future seems to him gray and unattractive; but he\r\ndoes not preach any unmanly gospel of despair. He thinks that in time\r\nto come, though life will be freer than in the past from dangers and\r\nvicissitudes, yet it will contain fewer of the strong pleasures and\r\nof the opportunities for doing great deeds that are so dear to mighty\r\nsouls. Nevertheless, he advises us all to front it bravely whether\r\nour hope be great or little; and he ends his book with these fine\r\nsentences: “Even so, there will still remain to us ourselves. Simply to\r\ndo our work in life, and to abide the issue, if we stand erect before\r\nthe eternal calm as cheerfully as our fathers faced the eternal unrest,\r\nmay be nobler training for our souls than the faith in progress.”\r\n\r\nWe do not agree with him that there will be only this eternal calm to\r\nface; we do not agree with him that the future holds for us a time when\r\nwe shall ask nothing from the day but to live, nor from the future but\r\nthat we may not deteriorate. We do not agree with him that there is a\r\nday approaching when the lower races will predominate in the world and\r\nthe higher races will have lost their noblest elements. But after all,\r\nit matters little what view we take of the future if, in our practice,\r\nwe but do as he preaches, and face resolutely whatever fate may have in\r\nstore. We, ourselves, are not certain that progress is assured; we only\r\nassert that it may be assured if we but live wise, brave, and upright\r\nlives. We do not know whether the future has in store for us calm or\r\nunrest. We cannot know beyond peradventure whether we can prevent the\r\nhigher races from losing their nobler traits and from being overwhelmed\r\nby the lower races. On the whole, we think that the greatest victories\r\nare yet to be won, the greatest deeds yet to be done, and that there\r\nare yet in store for our peoples and for the causes that we uphold\r\ngrander triumphs than have ever yet been scored. But be this as it may,\r\nwe gladly agree that the one plain duty of every man is to face the\r\nfuture as he faces the present, regardless of what it may have in store\r\nfor him, and, turning toward the light as he sees the light, to play\r\nhis part manfully, as a man among men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] _The Sewanee Review_, August, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n\r\n                        “SOCIAL EVOLUTION”[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd’s _Social Evolution_ is a suggestive, but a very crude\r\nbook; for the writer is burdened by a certain mixture of dogmatism\r\nand superficiality, which makes him content to accept half truths\r\nand insist that they are whole truths. Nevertheless, though the book\r\nappeals chiefly to minds of the kind which are uncharitably described\r\nas “half-baked,” Mr. Kidd does suggest certain lines of thought which\r\nare worth following--though rarely to his conclusions.\r\n\r\nHe deserves credit for appreciating what he calls “the outlook.” He\r\nsketches graphically, and with power, the problems which now loom up\r\nfor settlement before all of us who dwell in Western lands; and he\r\nportrays the varying attitudes of interest, alarm, and hope with which\r\nthe thinkers and workers of the day regard these problems. He points\r\nout that the problems which now face us are by no means parallel to\r\nthose that were solved by our forefathers one, two, or three centuries\r\nago. The great political revolutions seem to be about complete and the\r\ntime of the great social revolutions has arrived. We are all peering\r\neagerly into the future to try to forecast the action of the great dumb\r\nforces set in operation by the stupendous industrial revolution which\r\nhas taken place during the present century. We do not know what to make\r\nof the vast displacements of population, the expansion of the towns,\r\nthe unrest and discontent of the masses, and the uneasiness of those\r\nwho are devoted to the present order of things.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd sees these problems, but he gropes blindly when he tries to\r\nforecast their solution. He sees that the progress of mankind in past\r\nages can only have been made under and in accordance with certain\r\nbiological laws, and that these laws continue to work in human society\r\nat the present day. He realizes the all-importance of the laws which\r\ngovern the reproduction of mankind from generation to generation,\r\nprecisely as they govern the reproduction of the lower animals, and\r\nwhich, therefore, largely govern his progress. But he makes a cardinal\r\nmistake in treating of this kind of progress. He states with the\r\nutmost positiveness that, left to himself, man has not the slightest\r\ninnate tendency to make any onward progress whatever, and that if the\r\nconditions of life allowed each man to follow his own inclinations\r\nthe average of one generation would always tend to sink below the\r\naverage of the preceding. This is one of the sweeping generalizations\r\nof which Mr. Kidd is fond, and which mar so much of his work. He\r\nevidently finds great difficulty in stating a general law with the\r\nproper reservations and with the proper moderation of phrase; and so\r\nhe enunciates as truths statements which contain a truth, but which\r\nalso contain a falsehood. What he here says is undoubtedly true of the\r\nworld, taken as a whole. It is in all probability entirely false of the\r\nhighest sections of society. At any rate, there are numerous instances\r\nwhere the law he states does not work; and of course a single instance\r\noversets a sweeping declaration of such a kind.\r\n\r\nThere can be but little quarrel with what Mr. Kidd says as to the\r\nrecord of the world being a record of ceaseless progress on the one\r\nhand, and ceaseless stress and competition on the other; although even\r\nhere his statement is too broad, and his terms are used carelessly.\r\nWhen he speaks of progress being ceaseless, he evidently means by\r\nprogress simply change, so that as he uses the word it must be\r\nunderstood to mean progress backward as well as forward. As a matter\r\nof fact, in many forms of life and for long ages there is absolutely\r\nno progress whatever and no change, the forms remaining practically\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd further points out that the first necessity for every\r\nsuccessful form engaged in this struggle is the capacity for\r\nreproduction beyond the limits for which the conditions of life\r\ncomfortably provide, so that competition and selection must not only\r\nalways accompany progress, but must prevail in every form of life\r\nwhich is not actually retrograding. As already said, he accepts without\r\nreservation the proposition that if all the individuals of every\r\ngeneration in any species were allowed to propagate their kind equally,\r\nthe average of each generation would tend to fall below the preceding.\r\n\r\nFrom this position he draws as a corollary, that the wider the limits\r\nof selection, the keener the rivalry and the more rigid the selection,\r\njust so much greater will be the progress; while for any progress at\r\nall there must be some rivalry in selection, so that every progressive\r\nform must lead a life of continual strain and stress as it travels\r\nits upward path. This again is true in a measure, but is not true as\r\nbroadly as Mr. Kidd has stated it. The rivalry of natural selection\r\nis but one of the features in progress. Other things being equal, the\r\nspecies where this rivalry is keenest will make most progress; but then\r\n“other things” never are equal. In actual life those species make most\r\nprogress which are farthest removed from the point where the limits\r\nof selection are very wide, the selection itself very rigid, and the\r\nrivalry very keen. Of course the selection is most rigid where the\r\nfecundity of the animal is greatest; but it is precisely the forms\r\nwhich have most fecundity that have made least progress. Some time in\r\nthe remote past the guinea pig and the dog had a common ancestor. The\r\nfecundity of the guinea pig is much greater than that of the dog. Of a\r\ngiven number of guinea pigs born, a much smaller proportion are able\r\nto survive in the keen rivalry, so that the limits of selection are\r\nwider, and the selection itself more rigid; nevertheless the progress\r\nmade by the progenitors of the dog since eocene days has been much\r\nmore marked and rapid than the progress made by the progenitors of the\r\nguinea pig in the same time.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in speaking of the rise that has come through the stress of\r\ncompetition in our modern societies, and of the keenness of this stress\r\nin the societies that have gone fastest, Mr. Kidd overlooks certain\r\nvery curious features in human society. In the first place he speaks\r\nas though the stress under which nations make progress was primarily\r\nthe stress produced by multiplication beyond the limits of subsistence.\r\nThis, of course, would mean that in progressive societies the number of\r\nbirths and the number of deaths would both be at a maximum, for it is\r\nwhere the births and deaths are largest that the struggle for life is\r\nkeenest. If, as Mr. Kidd’s hypothesis assumes, progress was most marked\r\nwhere the struggle for life was keenest, the European peoples standing\r\nhighest in the scale would be the South Italians, the Polish Jews, and\r\nthe people who live in the congested districts of Ireland. As a matter\r\nof fact, however, these are precisely the peoples who have made least\r\nprogress when compared with the dominant strains among, for instance,\r\nthe English or Germans. So far is Mr. Kidd’s proposition from being\r\ntrue that, when studied in the light of the facts, it is difficult to\r\nrefrain from calling it the reverse of the truth. The race existing\r\nunder conditions which make the competition for bare existence keenest,\r\nnever progresses as fast as the race which exists under less stringent\r\nconditions. There must undoubtedly be a certain amount of competition,\r\na certain amount of stress and strain, but it is equally undoubted that\r\nif this competition becomes too severe the race goes down and not up;\r\nand it is further true that the race existing under the severest stress\r\nas regards this competition often fails to go ahead as fast even in\r\npopulation as does the race where the competition is less severe. No\r\nmatter how large the number of births may be, a race cannot increase if\r\nthe number of deaths also grows at an accelerating rate.\r\n\r\nTo increase greatly a race must be prolific, and there is no curse\r\nso great as the curse of barrenness, whether for a nation or an\r\nindividual. When a people gets to the position even now occupied by the\r\nmass of the French and by sections of the New Englanders, where the\r\ndeath rate surpasses the birth rate, then that race is not only fated\r\nto extinction but it deserves extinction. When the capacity and desire\r\nfor fatherhood and motherhood is lost the race goes down, and should go\r\ndown; and we need to have the plainest kind of plain speaking addressed\r\nto those individuals who fear to bring children into the world. But\r\nwhile this is all true, it remains equally true that immoderate\r\nincrease in no way furthers the development of a race, and does not\r\nalways help its increase even in numbers. The English-speaking peoples\r\nduring the past two centuries and a half have increased faster than any\r\nothers, yet there have been many other peoples whose birth rate during\r\nthe same period has stood higher.\r\n\r\nYet, again, Mr. Kidd, in speaking of the stress of the conditions\r\nof progress in our modern societies fails to see that most of the\r\nstress to which he refers does not have anything to do with increased\r\ndifficulty in obtaining a living, or with the propagation of the\r\nrace. The great prizes are battled for among the men who wage no war\r\nwhatever for mere subsistence, while the fight for mere subsistence is\r\nkeenest among precisely the classes which contribute very little indeed\r\nto the progress of the race. The generals and admirals, the poets,\r\nphilosophers, historians and musicians, the statesmen and judges, the\r\nlaw-makers and law-givers, the men of arts and of letters, the great\r\ncaptains of war and of industry--all these come from the classes where\r\nthe struggle for the bare means of subsistence is least severe, and\r\nwhere the rate of increase is relatively smaller than in the classes\r\nbelow. In civilized societies the rivalry of natural selection works\r\nagainst progress. Progress is made in spite of it, for progress results\r\nnot from the crowding out of the lower classes by the upper, but on the\r\ncontrary from the steady rise of the lower classes to the level of the\r\nupper, as the latter tend to vanish, or at most barely hold their own.\r\nIn progressive societies it is often the least fit who survive; but, on\r\nthe other hand, they and their children often tend to grow more fit.\r\n\r\nThe mere statement of these facts is sufficient to show not only how\r\nincorrect are many of Mr. Kidd’s premises and conclusions, but also how\r\nunwarranted are some of the fears which he expresses for the future.\r\nIt is plain that the societies and sections of societies where the\r\nindividual’s happiness is on the whole highest, and where progress\r\nis most real and valuable, are precisely these where the grinding\r\ncompetition and the struggle for mere existence is least severe.\r\nUndoubtedly in every progressive society there must be a certain\r\nsacrifice of individuals, so that there must be a certain proportion of\r\nfailures in every generation; but the actual facts of life prove beyond\r\nshadow of doubt that the extent of this sacrifice has nothing to do\r\nwith the rapidity or worth of the progress. The nations that make most\r\nprogress may do so at the expense of ten or fifteen individuals out of\r\na hundred, whereas the nations that make least progress, or even go\r\nbackwards, may sacrifice almost every man out of the hundred.\r\n\r\nThis last statement is in itself partly an answer to the position taken\r\nby Mr. Kidd, that there is for the individual no “rational sanction”\r\nfor the conditions of progress. In a progressive community, where the\r\nconditions provide for the happiness of four-fifths or nine-tenths\r\nof the people, there is undoubtedly a rational sanction for progress\r\nboth for the community at large and for the great bulk of its members;\r\nand if these members are on the whole vigorous and intelligent, the\r\nattitude of the smaller fraction who have failed will be a matter\r\nof little consequence. In such a community the conflict between the\r\ninterests of the individual and the organism of which he is a part,\r\nupon which Mr. Kidd lays so much emphasis, is at a minimum. The stress\r\nis severest, the misery and suffering greatest, among precisely\r\nthe communities which have made least progress--among the Bushmen,\r\nAustralian black fellows, and root-digger Indians, for instance.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Mr. Kidd does not define what he means by “rational\r\nsanction.” Indeed one of his great troubles throughout is his failure\r\nto make proper definitions, and the extreme looseness with which he\r\noften uses the definitions he does make. Apparently by “rational” he\r\nmeans merely selfish, and proceeds upon the assumption that “reason”\r\nmust always dictate to every man to do that which will give him the\r\ngreatest amount of individual gratification at the moment, no matter\r\nwhat the cost may be to others or to the community at large. This\r\nis not so. Side by side with the selfish development in life there\r\nhas been almost from the beginning a certain amount of unselfish\r\ndevelopment too; and in the evolution of humanity the unselfish side\r\nhas, on the whole, tended steadily to increase at the expense of the\r\nselfish, notably in the progressive communities about whose future\r\ndevelopment Mr. Kidd is so ill at ease. A more supreme instance of\r\nunselfishness than is afforded by motherhood cannot be imagined;\r\nand when Mr. Kidd implies, as he does very clearly, that there is\r\nno rational sanction for the unselfishnsess of motherhood, for the\r\nunselfishness of duty, or loyalty, he merely misuses the word rational.\r\nWhen a creature has reached a certain stage of development it will\r\ncause the female more pain to see her offspring starve than to work\r\nfor it, and she then has a very rational reason for so working. When\r\nhumanity has reached a certain stage it will cause the individual more\r\npain, a greater sense of degradation and shame and misery, to steal,\r\nto murder, or to lie, than to work hard and suffer discomfort. When\r\nman has reached this stage he has a very rational sanction for being\r\ntruthful and honest. It might also parenthetically be stated that when\r\nhe has reached this stage he has a tendency to relieve the sufferings\r\nof others, and he has for this course the excellent rational sanction\r\nthat it makes him more uncomfortable to see misery unrelieved than it\r\ndoes to deny himself a little in order to relieve it.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can cordially agree with Mr. Kidd’s proposition that many\r\nof the social plans advanced by would-be reformers in the interest of\r\noppressed individuals are entirely destructive of all growth and of\r\nall progress in society. Certain cults, not only Christian, but also\r\nBuddhistic and Brahminic, tend to develop an altruism which is as\r\n“supra-natural” as Mr. Kidd seemingly desires religion to be; for it\r\nreally is without foundation in reason, and therefore to be condemned.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd repeats again and again that the scientific development of\r\nthe nineteenth century confronts us with the fact that the interests\r\nof the social organism and of the individual are, and must remain,\r\nantagonistic, and the latter predominant, and that there can never be\r\nfound any sanction in individual reason for individual good conduct in\r\nsocieties where the conditions of progress prevail. From what has been\r\nsaid above it is evident that this statement is entirely without basis,\r\nand therefore that the whole scheme of mystic and highly irrational\r\nphilosophy which he founds upon it at once falls to the ground. There\r\nis no such necessary antagonism as that which he alleges. On the\r\ncontrary, in the most truly progressive societies, even now, for the\r\ngreat mass of the individuals composing them the interests of the\r\nsocial organism and of the individual are largely identical instead of\r\nantagonistic; and even where this is not true, there is a sanction of\r\nindividual reason, if we use the word _reason_ properly, for conduct on\r\nthe part of the individual which is subordinate to the welfare of the\r\ngeneral society.\r\n\r\nWe can measure the truth of his statements by applying them, not to\r\ngreat societies in the abstract, but to small social organisms in the\r\nconcrete. Take for instance the life of a regiment or the organization\r\nof a police department or fire department. The first duty of a\r\nregiment is to fight, and fighting means the death and disabling of\r\na large proportion of the men in the regiment. The case against the\r\nidentity of interests between the individual and the organism, as put\r\nby Mr. Kidd, would be far stronger in a regiment than in any ordinary\r\ncivilized society of the day. Yet as a matter of fact we know that in\r\nthe great multitude of regiments there is much more subordination of\r\nthe individual to the organism than is the case in any civilized state\r\ntaken as a whole. Moreover, this subordination is greatest in precisely\r\nthose regiments where the average individual is best off, because it\r\nis greatest in those regiments where the individual feels that high,\r\nstern pride in his own endurance and suffering, and in the great name\r\nof the organism of which he forms a part, that in itself yields one of\r\nthe loftiest of all human pleasures. If Mr. Kidd means anything when\r\nhe says that there is no rational sanction for progress he must also\r\nmean that there is no rational sanction for a soldier not flinching\r\nfrom the enemy when he can do so unobserved, for a sentinel not leaving\r\nhis post, for an officer not deserting to the enemy. Yet when he says\r\nthis he utters what is a mere jugglery on words. In the process of\r\nevolution men and societies have often reached such a stage that the\r\nbest type of soldier or citizen feels infinitely more shame and misery\r\nfrom neglect of duty, from cowardice or dishonesty, from selfish\r\nabandonment of the interests of the organism of which he is part, than\r\ncan be offset by the gratification of any of his desires. This, be it\r\nalso observed, often takes place, entirely independent of any religious\r\nconsiderations. The habit of useful self-sacrifice may be developed by\r\ncivilization in a great society as well as by military training in a\r\nregiment. The habit of useless self-sacrifice may also, unfortunately,\r\nbe developed; and those who practice it are but one degree less\r\nnoxious than the individuals who sacrifice good people to bad.\r\n\r\nThe religious element in our development is that on which Mr. Kidd most\r\nstrongly dwells, entitling it “the central feature of human history.” A\r\nvery startling feature of his treatment is that in religious matters he\r\nseemingly sets no value on the difference between truth and falsehood,\r\nfor he groups all religions together. In a would-be teacher of ethics\r\nsuch an attitude warrants severe rebuke; for it is essentially\r\ndishonest and immoral. Throughout his book he treats all religious\r\nbeliefs from the same standpoint, as if they were all substantially\r\nsimilar and substantially of the same value; whereas it is, of course,\r\na mere truism to say that most of them are mutually destructive. Not\r\nonly has he no idea of differentiating the true from the false, but he\r\nseems not to understand that the truth of a particular belief is of any\r\nmoment. Thus he says, in speaking of the future survival of religious\r\nbeliefs in general, that the most notable result of the scientific\r\nrevolution begun by Darwin must be “to establish them on a foundation\r\nas broad, deep, and lasting as any the theologians ever dreamed of.” If\r\nthis sentence means anything it means that all these religious beliefs\r\nwill be established on the same foundation. It hardly seems necessary\r\nto point out that this cannot be the fact. If the God of the Christians\r\nbe in very truth the one God, and if the belief in Him be established,\r\nas Christians believe it will, then the foundation for the religious\r\nbelief in Mumbo Jumbo can be neither broad, deep, nor lasting. In the\r\nsame way the beliefs in Mohammed and Buddha are mutually exclusive,\r\nand the various forms of ancestor worship and fetichism cannot all be\r\nestablished on a permanent basis, as they would be according to Mr.\r\nKidd’s theory.\r\n\r\nAgain, when Mr. Kidd rebukes science for its failure to approach\r\nreligion in a scientific spirit he shows that he fails to grasp the\r\nfull bearing of the subject which he is considering. This failure\r\ncomes in part from the very large, not to say loose, way in which he\r\nuses the words “science” and “religion.” There are many sciences and\r\nmany religions, and there are many different kinds of men who profess\r\nthe one or advocate the other. Where the intolerant professors of a\r\ngiven religious belief endeavor by any form of persecution to prevent\r\nscientific men of any kind from seeking to find out and establish\r\nthe truth, then it is quite idle to blame these scientific men for\r\nattacking with heat and acerbity the religious belief which prompts\r\nsuch persecution. The exigencies of a life and death struggle unfit\r\na man for the coldness of a mere scientific inquiry. Even the most\r\nenthusiastic naturalist, if attacked by a man-eating shark, would\r\nbe much more interested in evading or repelling the attack than in\r\ndetermining the precise specific relations of the shark. A less\r\nimportant but amusing feature of his argument is that he speaks as if\r\nhe himself had made an entirely new discovery when he learned of the\r\nimportant part played in man’s history by his religious beliefs. But\r\nMr. Kidd surely cannot mean this. He must be aware that all the great\r\nhistorians have given their full importance to such religious movements\r\nas the birth and growth of Christianity, the Reformation, the growth of\r\nIslamism, and the like. Mr. Kidd is quite right in insisting upon the\r\nimportance of the part played by religious beliefs, but he has fallen\r\ninto a vast error if he fails to understand that the great majority of\r\nthe historical and sociological writers have given proper weight to\r\nthis importance.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd’s greatest failing is his tendency to use words in false\r\nsenses. He uses “reason” in the false sense “selfish.” He then, in a\r\nspirit of mental tautology, assumes that reason must be necessarily\r\npurely selfish and brutal. He assumes that the man who risks his life\r\nto save a friend, the woman who watches over a sick child, and the\r\nsoldier who dies at his post, are unreasonable, and that the more their\r\nreason is developed the less likely they will be to act in these ways.\r\nThe mere statement of the assertion in such a form is sufficient to\r\nshow its nonsense to any one who will take the pains to think whether\r\nthe people who ordinarily perform such feats of self-sacrifice and\r\nself-denial are people of brutish minds or of fair intelligence.\r\n\r\nIf none of the ethical qualities are developed at the same time with\r\na man’s reason, then he may become a peculiarly noxious kind of wild\r\nbeast; but this is not in the least a necessity of the development of\r\nhis reason. It would be just as wise to say that it was a necessity\r\nof the development of his bodily strength. Undoubtedly the man with\r\nreason who is selfish and unscrupulous will, because of his added\r\npower, behave even worse than the man without reason who is selfish\r\nand unscrupulous; but the same is true of the man of vast bodily\r\nstrength. He has power to do greater harm to himself and to others;\r\nbut, because of this, to speak of bodily strength or of reason as in\r\nitself “profoundly anti-social and anti-evolutionary” is foolishness.\r\nMr. Kidd, as so often, is misled by a confusion of names for which he\r\nis himself responsible. The growth of rationalism, unaccompanied by any\r\ngrowth in ethics or morality, works badly. The society in which such a\r\ngrowth takes place will die out, and ought to die out. But this does\r\nnot imply that other communities quite as intelligent may not also be\r\ndeeply moral and be able to take firm root in the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd’s definitions of “supra-natural” and “ultra-rational”\r\nsanctions, the definitions upon which he insists so strongly and at\r\nsuch length, would apply quite as well to every crazy superstition\r\nof the most brutal savage as to the teachings of the New Testament.\r\nThe trouble with his argument is that, when he insists upon the\r\nimportance of this ultra-rational sanction, defining it as loosely as\r\nhe does, he insists upon too much. He apparently denies that men can\r\ncome to a certain state at which it will be rational for them to do\r\nright even to their own hurt. It is perfectly possible to build up\r\na civilization which, by its surroundings and by its inheritances,\r\nworking through long ages, shall make the bulk of the men and women\r\ndevelop such characteristics of unselfishness, as well as of wisdom,\r\nthat it will be the rational thing for them as individuals to act in\r\naccordance with the highest dictates of honor and courage and morality.\r\nIf the intellectual development of such a civilized community goes on\r\nat an equal pace with the ethical, it will persistently war against\r\nthe individuals in whom the spirit of selfishness, which apparently\r\nMr. Kidd considers the only rational spirit, shows itself strongly.\r\nIt will weed out these individuals and forbid them propagating, and\r\ntherefore will steadily tend to produce a society in which the rational\r\nsanction for progress shall be identical in the individual and the\r\nState. This ideal has never yet been reached, but long steps have been\r\ntaken towards reaching it; and in most progressive civilizations it\r\nis reached to the extent that the sanction for progress is the same\r\nnot only for the State but for each one of the bulk of the individuals\r\ncomposing it. When this ceases to be the case progress itself will\r\ngenerally cease and the community ultimately disappear.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd, having treated of religion in a preliminary way, and with\r\nmuch mystic vagueness, then attempts to describe the functions of\r\nreligious belief in the evolution of society. He has already given\r\ndefinitions of religion quoted from different authors, and he now\r\nproceeds to give his own definition. But first he again insists\r\nupon his favorite theory, that there can be no rational basis for\r\nindividual good conduct in society, using the word rational, according\r\nto his usual habit, as a synonym of selfish; and then asserts that\r\nthere can be no such thing as a rational religion. Apparently all\r\nthat Mr. Kidd demands on this point is that it shall be what he calls\r\nultra-rational, a word which he prefers to irrational. In other words\r\nhe casts aside as irrelevant all discussion as to a creed’s truth.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd then defines religion as being “a form of belief providing\r\nan ultra-rational sanction for that large class of conduct in the\r\nindividual where his interests and the interests of the social organism\r\nare antagonistic, and by which the former are rendered subordinate\r\nto the latter in the general interest of the evolution which the\r\nrace is undergoing,” and says that we have here the principle at the\r\nbase of all religions. Of course this is simply not true. All those\r\nreligions which busy themselves exclusively with the future life, and\r\nwhich even Mr. Kidd could hardly deny to be religious, do not have\r\nthis principle at their base at all. They have nothing to do with the\r\ngeneral interests of the evolution which the race is undergoing on this\r\nearth. They have to do only with the soul of the individual in the\r\nfuture life. They are not concerned with this world, they are concerned\r\nwith the world to come. All religions, and all forms of religions, in\r\nwhich the principle of asceticism receives any marked development are\r\npositively antagonistic to the development of the social organism.\r\nThey are against its interests. They do not tend in the least to\r\nsubordinate the interests of the individual to the interests of the\r\norganism “in the general interest of the evolution which the race is\r\nundergoing.” A religion like that of the Shakers means the almost\r\nimmediate extinction of the organism in which it develops. Such a\r\nreligion distinctly subordinates the interests of the organism to the\r\ninterests of the individual. The same is equally true of many of the\r\nmore ascetic developments of Christianity and Islam. There is strong\r\nprobability that there was a Celtic population in Iceland before the\r\narrival of the Norsemen, but these Celts belonged to the Culdee sect\r\nof Christians. They were anchorites, and professed a creed which\r\ncompletely subordinated the development of the race on this earth to\r\nthe well-being of the individual in the next. In consequence they died\r\nout and left no successors. There are creeds, such as most of the\r\npresent day creeds of Christianity, both Protestant and Catholic, which\r\ndo very noble work for the race because they teach its individuals to\r\nsubordinate their own interests to the interests of mankind; but it is\r\nidle to say this of every form of religious belief.\r\n\r\nIt is equally idle to pretend that this principle, which Mr. Kidd says\r\nlies at the base of all religions, does not also lie at the base of\r\nmany forms of ethical belief which could hardly be called religious.\r\nHis definition of religion could just as appropriately be used to\r\ndefine some forms of altruism or humanitarianism, while it does not\r\ndefine religion at all, if we use the word religion in the way in\r\nwhich it generally is used. If Mr. Kidd should write a book about\r\nhorses, and should define a horse as a striped equine animal found wild\r\nin South Africa, his definition would apply to certain members of the\r\nhorse family, but would not apply to that animal which we ordinarily\r\nmean when we talk of a horse; and, moreover, it would still be\r\nsufficiently loose to include two or three entirely distinct species.\r\nThis is precisely the trouble with Mr. Kidd’s definition of religion.\r\nIt does not define religion at all as the word is ordinarily used, and\r\nwhile it does apply to certain religious beliefs, it also applies quite\r\nas well to certain non-religious beliefs. We must, therefore, recollect\r\nthat throughout Mr. Kidd’s argument on behalf of the part that religion\r\nplays he does not mean what is generally understood by religion, but\r\nthe special form or forms which he here defines.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, in the race for life, that group of beings will tend\r\nultimately to survive in which the general feeling of the members,\r\nwhether due to humanitarianism, to altruism, or to some form of\r\nreligious belief proper, is such that the average individual has an\r\nunselfish--what Mr. Kidd would call an ultra-rational--tendency to\r\nwork for the ultimate benefit of the community as a whole. Mr. Kidd’s\r\nargument is so loose that it may be construed as meaning that, in\r\nthe evolution of society, irrational superstitions grow up from time\r\nto time, affect large bodies of the human race in their course of\r\ndevelopment, and then die away; and that this succession of evanescent\r\nreligious beliefs will continue for a very long time to come, perhaps\r\nas long as the human race exists. He may further mean that, except\r\nfor this belief in a long succession of lies, humanity could not go\r\nforward. His words, I repeat, are sufficiently involved to make it\r\npossible that he means this, but, if so, his book can hardly be taken\r\nas a satisfactory defence of religion.\r\n\r\nIf there is justification for any given religion, and justification for\r\nthe acceptance of supernatural authority as regards this religion, then\r\nthere can be no justification for the acceptance of all religions, good\r\nand bad alike. There can, at the outside, be a justification for but\r\none or two. Mr. Kidd’s grouping of all religions together is offensive\r\nto every earnest believer. Moreover, in his anxiety to insist only on\r\nthe irrational side of religion, he naturally tends to exalt precisely\r\nthose forms of superstition which are most repugnant to reasoning\r\nbeings with moral instincts, and which are most heartily condemned by\r\nbelievers in the loftiest religions. He apparently condemns Lecky for\r\nwhat Lecky says of that species of unpleasant and noxious anchorite\r\nbest typified by St. Simeon Stylites and the other pillar hermits. He\r\ncorrects Lecky for his estimate of this ideal of the fourth century,\r\nand says that instead of being condemned it should be praised, as\r\naffording striking evidence and example of the vigor of the immature\r\nsocial forces at work. This is not true. The type of anchorite of\r\nwhich Mr. Lecky speaks with such just condemnation flourished most\r\nrankly in Christian Africa and Asia Minor, the very countries where\r\nChristianity was so speedily overthrown by Islam. It was not an example\r\nof the vigor of the immature social forces at work; on the contrary,\r\nit was a proof that those social forces were rotten and had lost their\r\nvigor. Where an anchorite of the type Lecky describes, and Mr. Kidd\r\nimpliedly commends, was accepted as the true type of the church, and\r\nset the tone for religious thought, the church was corrupt, and was\r\nunable to make any effective defence against the scarcely baser form of\r\nsuperstition which received its development in Islamism. As a matter\r\nof fact, asceticism of this kind had very little in common with the\r\nreally vigorous and growing part of European Christianity, even at that\r\ntime. Such asceticism is far more closely related to the practices of\r\nsome loathsome Mohammedan dervish than to any creed which has properly\r\ndeveloped from the pure and lofty teachings of the Four Gospels. St.\r\nSimeon Stylites is more nearly kin to a Hindoo fakir than to Phillips\r\nBrooks or Archbishop Ireland.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd deserves praise for insisting as he does upon the great\r\nimportance of the development of humanitarian feelings and of the\r\nethical element in humanity during the past few centuries, when\r\ncompared with the mere material development. He is, of course, entirely\r\nright in laying the utmost stress upon the enormous part taken by\r\nChristianity in the growth of Western civilization. He would do well\r\nto remember, however, that there are other elements than that of merely\r\nceremonial Christianity at work, and that such ceremonial Christianity\r\nin other races produces quite different results, as he will see at\r\na glance, if he will recall that Abyssinia and Hayti are Christian\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn short, whatever Mr. Kidd says in reference to religion must be\r\nunderstood as being strictly limited by his own improper terminology.\r\nIf we should accept the words religion and religious belief in their\r\nordinary meaning, and should then accept as true what he states, we\r\nshould apparently have to conclude that progress depended largely upon\r\nthe fervor of the religious spirit, without regard to whether the\r\nreligion itself was false or true. If such were the fact, progress\r\nwould be most rapid in a country like Morocco, where the religious\r\nspirit is very strong indeed, far stronger than in any enlightened\r\nChristian country, but where, in reality, the religious development\r\nhas largely crushed out the ethical and moral development, so that\r\nthe country has gone steadily backward. A little philosophic study\r\nwould convince Mr. Kidd that while the ethical and moral development\r\nof a nation may, in the case of certain religions, be based on those\r\nreligions and develop with them and on the lines laid down by them,\r\nyet that in other countries where they develop at all they have to\r\ndevelop right in the teeth of the dominant religious beliefs, while in\r\nyet others they may develop entirely independent of them. If he doubts\r\nthis let him examine the condition of the Soudan under the Mahdi,\r\nwhere what he calls the ultra-rational and supra-natural sanctions were\r\naccepted without question, and governed the lives of the people to the\r\nexclusion alike of reason and morality. He will hardly assert that the\r\nSoudan is more progressive than say Scotland or Minnesota, where there\r\nis less of the spirit which he calls religious and which old-fashioned\r\nfolk would call superstitious.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd’s position in reference to the central feature of his argument\r\nis radically false; but he handles some of his other themes very\r\nwell. He shows clearly in his excellent chapter on modern socialism\r\nthat a state of retrogression must ensue if all incentives to strife\r\nand competition are withdrawn. He does not show quite as clearly as\r\nhe should that over-competition and too severe stress make the race\r\ndeteriorate instead of improving; but he does show that there must be\r\nsome competition, that there must be some strife. He makes it clear\r\nalso that the true function of the State, as it interferes in social\r\nlife, should be to make the chances of competition more even, not to\r\nabolish them. We wish the best men; and though we pity the man that\r\nfalls or lags behind in the race, we do not on that account crown him\r\nwith the victor’s wreath. We insist that the race shall be run on\r\nfairer terms than before because we remove all handicaps. We thus tend\r\nto make it more than ever a test of the real merits of the victor, and\r\nthis means that the victor must strive heart and soul for success. Mr.\r\nKidd’s attitude in describing socialism is excellent. He sympathizes\r\nwith the wrongs which the socialistic reformer seeks to redress, but\r\nhe insists that these wrongs must not be redressed, as the socialists\r\nwould have them, at the cost of the welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd also sees that the movement for political equality has nearly\r\ncome to an end, for its purpose has been nearly achieved. To it must\r\nnow succeed a movement to bring all people into the rivalry of life on\r\nequal conditions of social opportunity. This is a very important point,\r\nand he deserves the utmost credit for bringing it out. It is the great\r\ncentral feature in the development of our time, and Mr. Kidd has seen\r\nit so clearly and presented it so forcibly that we cannot but regret\r\nthat he should be so befogged in other portions of his argument.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidd has our cordial sympathy when he lays stress on the fact that\r\nour evolution cannot be called primarily intellectual. Of course there\r\nmust be an intellectual evolution, too, and Mr. Kidd perhaps fails in\r\nnot making this sufficiently plain. A perfectly stupid race can never\r\nrise to a very high plane; the negro, for instance, has been kept down\r\nas much by lack of intellectual development as by anything else; but\r\nthe prime factor in the preservation of a race is its power to attain a\r\nhigh degree of social efficiency. Love of order, ability to fight well\r\nand breed well, capacity to subordinate the interests of the individual\r\nto the interests of the community, these and similar rather humdrum\r\nqualities go to make up the sum of social efficiency. The race that\r\nhas them is sure to overturn the race whose members have brilliant\r\nintellects, but who are cold and selfish and timid, who do not breed\r\nwell or fight well, and who are not capable of disinterested love of\r\nthe community. In other words, character is far more important than\r\nintellect to the race as to the individual. We need intellect, and\r\nthere is no reason why we should not have it together with character;\r\nbut if we must choose between the two we choose character without a\r\nmoment’s hesitation.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] _North American Review_, July, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV\r\n\r\n                 THE LAW OF CIVILIZATION AND DECAY[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nFew more melancholy books have been written than Mr. Brooks Adams’s\r\n_Law of Civilization and Decay_. It is a marvel of compressed\r\nstatement. In a volume of less than four hundred pages Mr. Adams\r\nsingles out some of the vital factors in the growth and evolution of\r\ncivilized life during the last two thousand years; and so brilliant\r\nis his discussion of these factors as to give, though but a glimpse,\r\nyet one of the most vivid glimpses ever given, of some of the most\r\nimportant features in the world-life of Christendom. Of some of the\r\nfeatures only; for a fundamentally defective point in Mr. Adams’s\r\nbrilliant book is his failure to present certain phases of the life\r\nof the nations,--phases which are just as important as those which he\r\ndiscusses with such vigorous ability. Furthermore, he disregards not a\r\nfew facts which would throw light on others, the weight of which he\r\nfully recognizes. Both these shortcomings are very natural in a writer\r\nwho possesses an entirely original point of view, who is the first\r\nman to see clearly certain things that to his predecessors have been\r\nnebulous, and who writes with a fervent intensity of conviction, even\r\nin his bitterest cynicism, such as we are apt to associate rather with\r\nthe prophet and reformer than with a historian to whom prophet and\r\nreformer alike appeal no more than do their antitypes. It is a rare\r\nthing for a historian to make a distinct contribution to the philosophy\r\nof history; and this Mr. Adams has done. Naturally enough, he, like\r\nother men who break new ground, tends here and there to draw a devious\r\nfurrow.\r\n\r\nThe book is replete with vivid writing, and with sentences and\r\nparagraphs which stand out in the memory as marvels in the art of\r\npresenting the vital features of a subject with a few master-strokes.\r\nThe story of the Crusades, the outline of the English conquest of\r\nIndia, and the short tale of the rise of the house of Rothschild, are\r\nmasterpieces. Nowhere else is it possible to find in the same compass\r\nany description of the Crusades so profound in its appreciation of the\r\nmotives behind them, so startling in the vigor with which the chief\r\nactors, and the chief events, are portrayed. Indeed, one is almost\r\ntempted to say that it is in the description of the Crusades that Mr.\r\nAdams is at his best. He is dealing with a giant movement of humanity;\r\nand he grasps not only the colossal outward manifestations, but also\r\nthe spirit itself, and, above all, the strange and sinister changes\r\nwhich that spirit underwent. His mere description of the Baronies\r\nset up by the Crusaders in the conquered Holy Land, with their loose\r\nfeudal government, brings them before the reader’s eyes as few volumes\r\nspecially devoted to the subject could. It is difficult to write of a\r\nfortress and make a pen-picture which will always stay in the mind;\r\nyet this is what Mr. Adams has done in dealing with the grim religious\r\ncastles, terrible in size and power, which were built by the Knights of\r\nthe Temple and the Hospital as bulwarks against Saracen might. He is\r\nnot only a scholar of much research, but a student of art, who is so\r\nmuch more than a mere student as to be thrilled and possessed by what\r\nhe studies. He shows, with a beauty and vigor of style not unbecoming\r\nhis subject, how profoundly the art of Europe was affected by the\r\nCrusades. It is not every one who can write with equal interest of\r\nsacred architecture and military engineering, who can appreciate alike\r\nthe marvels of Gothic cathedrals and the frowning strength of feudal\r\nfortresses, and who furthermore can trace their inter-relation.\r\n\r\nThe story of the taking of Constantinople by the Crusaders who followed\r\nthe lead of the blind Doge Dandolo is told with an almost brutal\r\nruthlessness quite befitting the deed itself. Nowhere else in the book\r\nis Mr. Adams happier in his insistence upon the conflict between what\r\nhe calls the economic and the imaginative spirits. The incident sets\r\nwell with his favorite theory of the inevitable triumph of the economic\r\nover the imaginative man, as societies grow centralized, and the no\r\nless inevitable fossilization and ruin of the body politic which this\r\nvery triumph itself ultimately entails. The history of the English\r\nconquest of India is only less vividly told. Incidentally, it may be\r\nmentioned that one of Mr. Adams’s many merits is his contemptuous\r\nrefusal to be misled by modern criticism of Macaulay. He sees\r\nMacaulay’s greatness as a historian, and his essential truthfulness on\r\nmany of the very points where he has been most sharply criticised.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams’s book, however, is far more than a mere succession of\r\nbrilliant episodes. He fully sees that the value of facts lies in\r\ntheir relation to one another; and from the facts as he sees them he\r\ndeduces certain laws with more than a Thucydidean indifference as to\r\nhis own individual approval or disapproval of the development. The\r\nlife of nations, like any other form of life, is but one manifestation\r\nof energy; and Mr. Adams’s decidedly gloomy philosophy of life may\r\nbe gathered from the fact that he places fear and greed as the two\r\nforms of energy which stand conspicuously predominant; fear in the\r\nearlier, and greed in the later, stages of evolution from barbarism\r\nto civilization. Civilization itself he regards merely as the history\r\nof the movement from a condition of physical distribution to one of\r\nphysical concentration. During the earlier stages of this movement\r\nthe imaginative man--the man who stands in fear of a priesthood--is,\r\nin his opinion, the representative type, while with him, and almost\r\nequally typical, stand the soldier and the artist. As consolidation\r\nadvances, the economic man--the man of industry, trade, and\r\ncapital--tends to supplant the emotional and artistic types of manhood,\r\nand finally himself develops along two lines,--“the usurer in his most\r\nformidable aspect, and the peasant whose nervous system is best adapted\r\nto thrive on scanty nutriment.” These two very unattractive types are,\r\nin his belief, the inevitable final products of all civilization, as\r\ncivilization has hitherto developed; and when they have once been\r\nproduced there follows either a stationary period, during which the\r\nwhole body politic gradually ossifies and atrophies, or else a period\r\nof utter disintegration.\r\n\r\nThis is not a pleasant theory; it is in many respects an entirely false\r\ntheory; but nevertheless there is in it a very ugly element of truth.\r\nOne does not have to accept either all Mr. Adams’s theories or all his\r\nfacts in order to recognize more than one disagreeable resemblance\r\nbetween the world as it is to-day, and the Roman world under the\r\nEmpire, or the Greek world under the successors of Alexander. Where he\r\nerrs is in his failure to appreciate the fundamental differences which\r\nutterly destroy any real parallelism between the two sets of cases.\r\nIndeed, his zeal in championing his theories leads him at times into\r\npositions which are seen at a glance to be untenable.\r\n\r\nProbably Mr. Adams’s account of the English Reformation, and of Henry\r\nVIII. and his instruments, is far nearer the truth than Froude’s. But\r\nhis view of the evils upon which the reformers as a whole waged war,\r\nand of the spirit which lay behind the real leaders and spurred them\r\non, is certainly less accurate than the view given by Froude in his\r\n_Erasmus_ and _Council of Trent_. It can be partly corrected by the\r\nstudy of a much less readable book--Mr. Henry C. Lea’s work on _The\r\nInquisition_. Yet Mr. Adams’s description of the English Reformation\r\nis very powerful, and has in it a vein of bitter truth; though on the\r\nwhole it is perhaps not so well done as his account of the suppression\r\nof the Templars in France. If he can be said to have any heroes, the\r\nTemplars must certainly be numbered among them.\r\n\r\nHe is at his best in describing the imaginative man, and especially\r\nthe imaginative man whose energy manifests itself in the profession of\r\narms. His description of the tremendous change which passed over Europe\r\nduring the centuries which saw, what is commonly called, the decay of\r\nfaith is especially noteworthy. In no other history are there to be\r\nfound two sentences which portray more vividly the reasons for the\r\ntriumph of the great Pope Hildebrand over the Emperor Henry, than these:\r\n\r\n “To Henry’s soldiers the world was a vast space peopled by those\r\n fantastic beings which are still seen on Gothic towers. These demons\r\n obeyed the monk of Rome, and his army, melting from the Emperor under\r\n a nameless horror, left him helpless.”\r\n\r\nHis account of the contrast between the relations of Philip Augustus\r\nand of Philip the Fair with the Church is dramatic in its intensity.\r\nTo Mr. Adams, Philip the Fair, even more than Henry VIII., is the\r\nincarnation of the economic spirit in its conflict with the Church;\r\nand he makes him an even more repulsive, though perhaps an abler, man\r\nthan Henry. In this he is probably quite right. His account of the\r\nhounding down of Boniface, and the cruel destruction of the Templars,\r\nis as stirring as it is truthful; but he certainly pushes his theory\r\nto an altogether impossible extreme when he states that the moneyed\r\nclass, the _bourgeoisie_, was already the dominant force in France.\r\nThe heroes of Froissart still lay in the future; and for centuries to\r\ncome the burgher was to be outweighed by king, priest, and noble. The\r\neconomic man, the man of trade and money, was, at that time, in no\r\nsense dominant.\r\n\r\nThat there is grave reason for some of Mr. Adams’s melancholy\r\nforebodings, no serious student of the times, no sociologist or\r\nreformer, and no practical politician who is interested in more than\r\nmomentary success, will deny. A foolish optimist is only less noxious\r\nthan an utter pessimist; and the pre-requisite for any effort, whether\r\nhopeful or hopeless, to better our conditions is an accurate knowledge\r\nof what these conditions are. There is no use in blinding ourselves\r\nto certain of the tendencies and results of our high-pressure\r\ncivilization. Some very ominous facts have become more and more\r\napparent during the present century, in which the social movement of\r\nthe white race has gone on with such unexampled and ever-accelerating\r\nrapidity. The rich have undoubtedly grown richer; and, while the most\r\ncareful students are inclined to answer with an emphatic negative\r\nthe proposition that the poor have grown poorer, it is nevertheless\r\ncertain that there has been a large absolute, though not relative,\r\nincrease of poverty, and that the very poor tend to huddle in immense\r\nmasses in the cities. Even though these masses are, relatively to\r\nthe rest of the population, smaller than they formerly were, they\r\nconstitute a standing menace, not merely to our prosperity, but to our\r\nexistence. The improvement in the means of communication, moreover,\r\nhas so far immensely increased the tendency of the urban population to\r\ngrow at the expense of the rural; and philosophers have usually been\r\ninclined to regard the ultimate safety of a nation as resting upon\r\nits peasantry. The improvement in machinery, the very perfection of\r\nscientific processes, cause great, even though temporary, suffering\r\nto unskilled laborers. Moreover, there is a certain softness of fibre\r\nin civilized nations which, if it were to prove progressive, might\r\nmean the development of a cultured and refined people quite unable to\r\nhold its own in those conflicts through which alone any great race\r\ncan ultimately march to victory. There is also a tendency to become\r\nfixed, and to lose flexibility. Most ominous of all, there has become\r\nevident, during the last two generations, a very pronounced tendency\r\namong the most highly civilized races, and among the most highly\r\ncivilized portions of all races, to lose the power of multiplying, and\r\neven to decrease; so much so as to make the fears of the disciples of\r\nMalthus a century ago seem rather absurd to the dweller in France or\r\nNew England to-day.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams does not believe that any individual or group of individuals\r\ncan influence the destiny of a race for good or for evil. All of us\r\nadmit that it is very hard by individual effort thus to make any\r\nalteration in destiny; but we do not think it impossible; and Mr. Adams\r\nwill have performed a great service if he succeeds in fixing the eyes\r\nof the men who ought to know thoroughly the problems set us to solve,\r\nupon the essential features of these problems. I do not think his\r\ndiagnosis of the disease is in all respects accurate. I believe there\r\nis an immense amount of healthy tissue as to the existence of which he\r\nis blind; but there is disease, and it is serious enough to warrant\r\nvery careful examination.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Adams is certainly in error in putting the immense\r\nimportance he does upon the question of the expansion or contraction of\r\nthe currency. There is no doubt whatever that a nation is profoundly\r\naffected by the character of its currency; but there seems to be\r\nequally little doubt that the currency is only one, and by no means the\r\nmost important, among a hundred causes which profoundly affect it.\r\nThe United States has been on a gold basis, and on a silver basis; it\r\nhas been on a paper basis, and on a basis of what might be called the\r\nscraps and odds and ends of the currencies of a dozen other nations;\r\nbut it has kept on developing along the same lines no matter what its\r\ncurrency has been. If a change of currency were so enacted as to amount\r\nto dishonesty, that is, to the repudiation of debts, it would be a very\r\nbad thing morally; or, if a change took place in a manner that would\r\ntemporarily reduce the purchasing power of the wage-earner, it would be\r\na very bad thing materially; but the current of the national life would\r\nnot be wholly diverted or arrested, it would merely be checked, even\r\nby such a radical change. The forces that most profoundly shape the\r\ncourse of a nation’s life lie far deeper than the mere use of gold or\r\nof silver, the mere question of the appreciation or depreciation of one\r\nmetal when compared with the other, or when compared with commodities\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams unconsciously shows this in his first and extremely\r\ninteresting chapter on the Romans. In one part of this chapter he\r\nseems to ascribe the ruin of the Roman Empire to the contraction of\r\nthe currency, saying, “with contraction came that fall of prices which\r\nfirst ruined, then enslaved, and finally exterminated the native rural\r\npopulation of Italy.” This he attributes to the growth of the economic\r\nor capitalistic spirit. As he puts it, “the stronger type exterminated\r\nthe weaker, the money-lender killed out the husbandman, the soldiers\r\nvanished, and the farms on which they once flourished were left\r\ndesolate.”\r\n\r\nBut, curiously enough, Mr. Adams himself shows that all this really\r\noccurred during the two centuries, or thereabouts, extending from the\r\nend of the second Punic war through the reign of the first of the Roman\r\nemperors; and this was a period of currency expansion, not of currency\r\ncontraction. Moreover, it was emphatically a period when the military\r\nand not the economic type was supreme. The great Romans of the first\r\nand second centuries before Christ were soldiers, not merchants or\r\nusurers, and they could only be said to possess the economic instinct\r\nincidentally, in so far as it is possessed by every man of the military\r\ntype who seizes the goods accumulated by the man of the economic type.\r\nIt was during these centuries, when the military type was supreme,\r\nand when prices were rising, that the ruin, the enslavement and the\r\nextermination of the old rural population of Italy began. It was during\r\nthese centuries that the husbandmen left the soil and became the mob of\r\nRome, clamoring for free bread and the games of the amphitheatre. It\r\nwas toward the close of this period that the Roman army became an army\r\nno longer of Roman citizens, but of barbarians trained in the Roman\r\nmanner; it was toward the close of this period that celibacy became so\r\ncrying an evil as to invoke the vain action of the legislature, and\r\nthat the Roman race lost the power of self-perpetuation. What happened\r\nin the succeeding centuries,--the period of the contraction of the\r\ncurrency and the rise of prices,--was merely the completion of the ruin\r\nwhich had already been practically accomplished.\r\n\r\nThese facts seem to show clearly that the question of the currency\r\nhad really little or nothing to do with the decay of the Roman fibre.\r\nThis decay began under one set of currency conditions, and continued\r\nunchanged when these conditions became precisely reversed. An\r\ninfinitely more important cause, as Mr. Adams himself shows, was the\r\nimmense damage done to the Italian husbandman by the importation of\r\nAsiatic and African slaves; which was in all probability the chief of\r\nthe causes that conspired to ruin him. He was forced into competition\r\nwith races of lower vitality; races tenacious of life, who possessed a\r\nvery low standard of living, and who furnished to the great slave-owner\r\nhis cheap labor. Mr. Adams shows that the husbandman was affected, not\r\nonly by the importation of vast droves of slaves to compete with him\r\nin Italy, but by the competition with low-class labor in Egypt and\r\nelsewhere. These very points, if developed with Mr. Adams’s skill,\r\nwould have enabled him to show in a very striking manner the radical\r\ncontrast between the present political and social life of civilized\r\nstates, and the political and social life of Rome during what he\r\ncalls the capitalistic or closing period. At present, the minute that\r\nthe democracy becomes convinced that the workman and the peasant are\r\nsuffering from competition with cheap labor, whether this cheap\r\nlabor take the form of alien immigration, or of the importation of\r\ngoods manufactured abroad by low-class working-men, or of commodities\r\nproduced by convicts, it at once puts a stop to the competition. We\r\nkeep out the Chinese, very wisely; we have put an end to the rivalry\r\nof convict contract labor with free labor; we are able to protect\r\nourselves, whenever necessary, by heavy import duties, against the\r\neffect of too cheap labor in any foreign country; and, finally, in the\r\ncivil war, we utterly destroyed the system of slavery, which really\r\nwas threatening the life of the free working-man in a way in which it\r\ncannot possibly be threatened by any conceivable development of the\r\n“capitalistic” spirit.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams possesses a very intimate knowledge of finance, and there\r\nare many of his discussions on this subject into which only an expert\r\nwould be competent to enter. Nevertheless, on certain financial and\r\neconomic questions, touching matters open to discussion by the man\r\nof merely ordinary knowledge, his terminology is decidedly vague.\r\nThis is especially true when he speaks of “the producer.” Now the\r\nproducer, as portrayed by the Populist stump orator or writer of\r\npolitical and economic pamphlets, is a being with whom we became quite\r\nintimate during the recent campaign; but we have found it difficult to\r\nunderstand at all definitely who this “producer” actually is. According\r\nto one school of Populistic thinkers the farmer is the producer; but\r\naccording to another and more radical school this is not so, unless\r\nthe farmer works with his hands and not his head, this school limiting\r\nthe application of the term “producer” to the working-man who does\r\nthe immediate manual work of production. On the other hand those who\r\nspeak with scientific precision must necessarily class as producers\r\nall men whose work results directly or indirectly in production.\r\nUnder this definition, inventors and men who improve the methods of\r\ntransportation, like railway presidents, and men who enable other\r\nproducers to work, such as bankers who loan money wisely, are all\r\nthemselves to be classed as producers, and often indeed as producers of\r\nthe most effective kind.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the population consists of producers; and in\r\nconsequence the majority of the sales by producers are sales to other\r\nproducers. It requires one set of producers to make a market for any\r\nother set of producers; and in consequence the rise or fall of prices\r\nis a good or a bad thing for different bodies of producers according\r\nto the different circumstances of each case. Mr. Adams says that the\r\nperiod from the middle of the twelfth to the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncenturies was an interval of “almost unparalleled prosperity,” which\r\nhe apparently ascribes to the expansion of the currency, with which,\r\nhe says, “went a rise in prices, all producers grew rich, and for\r\nmore than two generations the strain of competition was so relaxed\r\nthat the different classes of the population preyed upon each other\r\nless savagely than they are wont to do in less happy times.” It is\r\nnot exactly clear how a rise in the prices both of what one producer\r\nsells another, and of what he in return buys from that other, can\r\nsomehow make both of them rich, and relax the strain of competition.\r\nCertainly in the present century, competition has been just as severe\r\nin times of high prices; and some of the periods of greatest prosperity\r\nhave coincided with the periods of very low prices. There is reason\r\nto believe that low prices are ultimately of great benefit to the\r\nwage-earners. A rise in prices generally injures them. Moreover, in\r\nthe century of which Mr. Adams speaks, the real non-producers were the\r\ngreat territorial feudal lords and the kings and clergymen; and these\r\nwere then supreme. It was the period of the ferocious Albigensian\r\ncrusades. It is true that it ushered in a rather worse period,--that\r\nof the struggle between England and France, with its attendant peasant\r\nwars and Jacqueries, and huge bands of marauding free-companies.\r\nBut the alteration for the worse was due to a fresh outbreak of\r\n“imaginative” spirit; and the first period was full of recurring\r\nplagues and famines, besides the ordinary unrest, murder, oppression,\r\npillage, and general corruption. Mr. Adams says that the different\r\nclasses of the population during that happy time “preyed upon each\r\nother less savagely” than at other times. All that need be said in\r\nanswer is that there is not now a civilized community, under no matter\r\nwhat stress of capitalistic competition, in which the different classes\r\nprey upon one another with one-tenth the savagery they then showed;\r\nor in which famine and disease, even leaving war out of account, come\r\nanywhere near causing so much misery to poor people, and above all to\r\nthe wage-earners, or working-men, the under strata and base of the\r\nproducing classes.\r\n\r\nFrom many of the statements in Mr. Adams’s very interesting concluding\r\nchapter I should equally differ; and yet this chapter is one which is\r\nnot merely interesting but soul-stirring, and it contains much with\r\nwhich most of us would heartily agree. Through the cold impartiality\r\nwith which he strives to work merely as a recorder of facts, there\r\nbreak now and then flashes of pent-up wrath and vehement scorn\r\nfor all that is mean and petty in a purely materialistic, purely\r\ncapitalistic, civilization. With his scorn of what is ignoble and\r\nbase in our development, his impatient contempt of the deification of\r\nthe stock-market, the trading-counter, and the factory, all generous\r\nsouls must agree. When we see prominent men deprecating the assertion\r\nof national honor because it “has a bad effect upon business,” or\r\nbecause it “impairs the value of securities”; when we see men seriously\r\naccepting Mr. Edward Atkinson’s pleasant theory that patriotism is of\r\nno consequence when compared with the price of cotton sheeting or the\r\ncapacity to undersell our competitors in foreign markets, it is no\r\nwonder that a man who has in him the stuff of ancestors who helped to\r\nfound our Government, and helped to bring it safely through the Civil\r\nWar should think blackly of the future. But Mr. Adams should remember\r\nthat there always have been men of this merely huckstering type, or of\r\nother types not much higher. It is not a nice thing that Mr. Eliot,\r\nthe president of one of the greatest educational institutions of the\r\nland, should reflect discredit upon the educated men of the country\r\nby his attitude on the Venezuela affair, carrying his desertion of\r\nAmerican principles so far as to find himself left in the lurch by\r\nthe very English statesman whose cause he was championing; but Mr.\r\nAdams by turning to the “History” of the administration of Madison,\r\nby his brother, Henry Adams, would find that Mr. Eliot had plenty of\r\nintellectual ancestors among the “blue lights” federalists of that day.\r\nTimothy Pickering showed the same eager desire to stand by another\r\ncountry to the hurt of his own country’s honor, and Timothy Pickering\r\nwas a United States Senator whose conduct was far more reprehensible\r\nthan that of any private individual could be. We have advanced, not\r\nretrograded, since 1812.\r\n\r\nThis applies also to what Mr. Adams says of the fall of the soldier\r\nand the rise of the usurer. He quite overstates his case in asserting\r\nthat in Europe the soldier has lost his importance since 1871, and that\r\nthe administration of society since then has fallen into the hands of\r\nthe “economic man,” thereby making a change “more radical than any\r\nthat happened at Rome or even at Byzantium.” In the first place, a\r\nperiod of a quarter of a century is altogether too short to admit of\r\nsuch a generalization. In the next place, the facts do not support\r\nthis particular generalization. The Germans are quite as military in\r\ntype as ever they were, and very much more so than they were at any\r\nperiod during the two centuries preceding Bismarck and Moltke. Nor is\r\nit true to say that “the ruler of the French people has passed for the\r\nfirst time from the martial to the moneyed type.” Louis XV. and Louis\r\nPhilippe can hardly be held to belong to any recognized martial type;\r\nand the reason of the comparative sinking of the military man in France\r\nis due not in the least to the rise of his economic fellow-countryman,\r\nbut to the rise of the other military man in Germany. Mr. Adams\r\nsays that since the capitulation of Paris the soldier has tended\r\nto sink more and more, until he merely receives his orders from\r\nfinanciers (which term when used by Mr. Adams includes all business\r\nand working-men) with his salary, without being allowed a voice, even\r\nin the questions which involve peace and war. Now this is precisely\r\nthe position which the soldier has occupied for two centuries among\r\nEnglish-speaking races; and it is during these very centuries that the\r\nEnglish-speaking race has produced its greatest soldiers. Marlborough\r\nand Wellington, Nelson and Farragut, Grant and Lee, exactly fill Mr.\r\nAdams’s definition of the position into which soldiers have “sunk”; and\r\nthe United States has just elected as President, as it so frequently\r\nhas done before, a man who owes his place in politics in large part to\r\nhis having done gallant service as a soldier, and who is in no sense a\r\nrepresentative of the moneyed type.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Adams gloomily remarks that “producers have become the\r\nsubjects of the possessors of hoarded wealth,” and that among\r\ncapitalists the money-lenders form an aristocracy, while debtors are\r\nhelpless and the servants of the creditors. All this is really quite\r\nunworthy of Mr. Adams, or of anyone above the intellectual level of\r\nMr. Bryan, Mr. Henry George, or Mr. Bellamy. Any man who has had the\r\nslightest practical knowledge of legislation, whether as Congressman\r\nor as State legislator, knows that nowadays laws are passed much\r\nmore often with a view to benefiting the debtors than the creditors;\r\nalways excepting that very large portion of the creditor class which\r\nincludes the wage-earners. “Producers”--whoever they may be--are not\r\nthe subjects of “hoarded wealth,” nor of anyone nor anything else.\r\nCapital is not absolute; and it is idle to compare the position of the\r\ncapitalist nowadays with his position when his workmen were slaves\r\nand the law-makers were his creatures. The money-lender, by whom I\r\nsuppose Mr. Adams means the banker, is not an aristocrat as compared\r\nto other capitalists,--at any rate in the United States. The merchant,\r\nthe manufacturer, the railroad man, stand just as the banker does;\r\nand bankers vary among themselves just as any other business men do.\r\nThey do not form a “class” at all; anyone who wishes to can go into\r\nthe business; men fail and succeed in it just as in other businesses.\r\nAs for the debtors being powerless, if Mr. Adams knows any persons\r\nwho have lent money in Kansas or similar States they will speedily\r\nenlighten him on this subject, and will give him an exact idea of\r\nthe extent to which the debtor is the servant of the creditor. In\r\nthose States the creditor--and especially the Eastern money-lender\r\nor “gold-bug”--is the man who has lost all his money. Mr. Adams\r\ncan readily find this out by the simple endeavor to persuade some\r\n“money-lender,” or other “Wall Street shark” to go into the business\r\nof lending money on Far-Western farm property. The money-lender in the\r\nmost civilized portions of the United States always loses if the debtor\r\nis loser, or if the debtor is dishonest. Of course there are “sharpers”\r\namong bankers, as there are among producers. Moreover, the private,\r\nas distinguished from the corporate, debtor borrows for comparatively\r\nshort periods, so that he is practically not at all affected by an\r\nappreciating currency; the rise is much too small to count in the\r\ncase of the individual, though it may count in the long-term bonds\r\nof a nation or corporation. The wage of the working-man rises, while\r\ninterest, which is the wage of the capitalist, sinks.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams’s study of the rise of the usurer in India and the ruin of\r\nthe martial races is very interesting; but it has not the slightest\r\nbearing upon anything which is now happening in Western civilization.\r\nThe debtor, in America at least, is amply able to take care of his\r\nown interests. Our experience shows conclusively that the creditors\r\nonly prosper when the debtors prosper, and the danger lies less in\r\nthe accumulation of debts, than in their repudiation. Among us the\r\ncommunities which repudiate their debts, which inveigh loudest\r\nagainst their creditors, and which offer the poorest field for the\r\noperations of the honest banker (whom they likewise always call\r\n“money-lender,”) are precisely those which are least prosperous and\r\nleast self-respecting. There are, of course, individuals here and\r\nthere who are unable to cope with the money-lender, and even sections\r\nof the country where this is true; but this only means that a weak or\r\nthriftless man can be robbed by a sharp money-lender just as he can be\r\nrobbed by the sharp producer from whom he buys or to whom he sells.\r\nThere is, in certain points, a very evident incompatibility of interest\r\nbetween the farmer who wishes to sell his product at a high rate, and\r\nthe working-man who wishes to buy that product at a low rate; but the\r\nsuccess of the capitalist, and especially of the banker, is conditioned\r\nupon the prosperity of both working-man and farmer.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Adams speaks of the change in the relations of women and men\r\nhe touches on the vital weakness of our present civilization. If we\r\nare, in truth, tending toward a point where the race will cease to be\r\nable to perpetuate itself, our civilization is of course a failure.\r\nNo quality in a race atones for the failure to produce an abundance\r\nof healthy children. The problem upon which Mr. Adams here touches\r\nis the most serious of all problems, for it lies at the root of, and\r\nindeed itself is, national life. But it is hard to accept seriously\r\nMr. Adams’s plea that “martial” men loved their wives more than\r\n“economic” men do, and showed their love by buying them. Of course the\r\nonly reason why a woman was bought in early times was because she was\r\nlooked upon like any other chattel; she was “loved” more than she is\r\nnow only as a negro was “loved” more by the negro-trader in 1860 than\r\nat present. The worship of women during the Middle Ages was, in its\r\npractical effects, worship of a very queer kind. The “economic man” of\r\nthe present day is beyond comparison gentler and more tender and more\r\nloving to women than the “emotional man” of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams closes with some really fine paragraphs, of which the general\r\npurport is, that the advent of the capitalist and the economic man, and\r\nespecially the advent of the usurer, mark a condition of consolidation\r\nwhich means the beginning of utter decay, so that our society, as a\r\nresult of this accelerated movement away from emotionalism and towards\r\ncapitalism, is now in a condition like that of the society of the later\r\nRoman Empire. He forgets, however, that there are plenty of modern\r\nstates which have entirely escaped the general accelerated movement of\r\nour time. Spain on the one hand, and Russia on the other, though alike\r\nin nothing else, are alike in being entirely outside the current of\r\nmodern capitalistic development. Spain never suffered from capitalists.\r\nShe exterminated the economic man in the interest of the emotional\r\nand martial man. As a result she has sunk to a condition just above\r\nthat of Morocco--another state, by the way, which still clings to the\r\nmartial and emotional type, and is entirely free from the vices of\r\ncapitalistic development, and from the presence of the usurer, save as\r\nthe usurer existed in the days of Isaac of York. Soldiers and artists\r\nhave sunk lower in Spain than elsewhere, although they have had no\r\ncompetition from the economic man. Russia is in an entirely different\r\nposition. Russia is eminently emotional, and her capitalists are of the\r\nmost archaic type; but it is difficult to say exactly what Russia has\r\ndone for art, or in what respect her soldiers are superior to other\r\nsoldiers; and certainly the life of the lower classes in Russia is on\r\nthe average far less happy than the life of the workingman and farmer\r\nin any English-speaking country. Evidently, as Spain and Russia show,\r\nnational decay, or non-development may have little to do with economic\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams has shown well that the progress of civilization and\r\ncentralization has depended largely upon the growing mastery of the\r\nattack over the defence; but when he says that the martial type\r\nnecessarily decays as civilization progresses, he goes beyond what\r\nhe can prove. The economic man in England, Holland, and the United\r\nStates has for several centuries proved a much better fighter than\r\nthe martial emotionalist of the Spanish countries. It is Spain which\r\nis now decaying; not the nations with capitalists. The causes which\r\nmake Russia formidable are connected with the extent of her territory\r\nand her population, for she has certainly failed so far to produce\r\nfighting men at all superior to the fighting men of the economic\r\ncivilizations. In a pent-up territory she would rise less rapidly, and\r\nfall more rapidly, than they would; and her freedom from centralization\r\nand capitalization would not help her. Spain, which is wholly untouched\r\nby modern economic growth, suffers far more than any English-speaking\r\ncountry from maladies like those of Rome in its decadence; and Rome\r\ndid not decay from the same causes which affect modern America or\r\nEurope; while Russia owes her immunity from a few of the evils that\r\naffect the rest of us, to causes unconnected with her backwardness\r\nin civilization, and moreover has worse evils of her own to contend\r\nwith. The English-speaking man has so far out-built, out-fought, and\r\nout-administered the Russian; and he is as far as the poles away from\r\nthe Roman of the later Empire.\r\n\r\nMoreover, instead of the mercenary or paid police growing in relative\r\nstrength, as Mr. Adams says, it has everywhere shrunk during the\r\nlast fifty years, when compared with the mass of armed farmers and\r\nwage-earners who make up a modern army. The capitalist can no longer,\r\nas in ages past, count upon the soldiers as being of his party; he\r\ncan only count upon them when they are convinced that in fighting\r\nhis battle they are fighting their own; although under modern\r\nindustrial conditions this is generally the case. Again, Mr. Adams is\r\nin error in his facts, when he thinks that producers have prospered\r\nin the silver-using, as compared with the gold-using, countries.\r\nThe wage-earner and small farmer of the United States, or even of\r\nEurope, stand waist high above their brothers in Mexico and the other\r\ncommunities that use only silver. The prosperity of the wage-earning\r\nclass is more important to the state than the prosperity of any other\r\nclass in the community, for it numbers within its ranks two-thirds of\r\nthe people of the community. The fact that modern society rests upon\r\nthe wage-earner, whereas ancient society rested upon the slave, is of\r\nsuch transcendent importance as to forbid any exact comparison between\r\nthe two, save by way of contrast.\r\n\r\nWhile there is in modern times a decrease in emotional religion, there\r\nis an immense increase in practical morality. There is a decrease of\r\nthe martial type found among savages and the people of the Middle Ages,\r\nexcept as it still survives in the slums of great cities; but there\r\nremains a martial type infinitely more efficient than any that preceded\r\nit. There are great branches of industry which call forth in those that\r\nfollow them more hardihood, manliness, and courage than any industry of\r\nancient times. The immense masses of men connected with the railroads\r\nare continually called upon to exercise qualities of mind and body such\r\nas in antiquity no trade and no handicraft demanded. There are, it is\r\ntrue, influences at work to shake the vitality, courage, and manliness\r\nof the race; but there are other influences which tell in exactly the\r\nopposite direction; and, whatever may come in the future, hitherto\r\nthe last set of influences have been strongest. As yet, while men are\r\nmore gentle and more honest than before, it cannot be said that they\r\nare less brave; and they are certainly more efficient as fighters.\r\nIf our population decreases; if we lose the virile, manly qualities,\r\nand sink into a nation of mere hucksters, putting gain above national\r\nhonor, and subordinating everything to mere ease of life; then we shall\r\nindeed reach a condition worse than that of the ancient civilizations\r\nin the years of their decay. But at present no comparison could be less\r\napt than that of Byzantium, or Rome in its later years, with a great\r\nmodern state where the thronging millions who make up the bulk of the\r\npopulation are wage-earners, who themselves decide their own destinies;\r\na state which is able in time of need to put into the field armies,\r\ncomposed exclusively of its own citizens, more numerous than any which\r\nthe world has ever before seen, and with a record of fighting in the\r\nimmediate past with which there is nothing in the annals of antiquity\r\nto compare.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] The _Forum_, January, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI\r\n\r\n REFORM THROUGH SOCIAL WORK--SOME FORCES THAT TELL FOR DECENCY IN NEW\r\n                             YORK CITY[24]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny one who has a serious appreciation of the immensely complex\r\nproblems of our present-day life, and of those kinds of benevolent\r\neffort which for lack of a better term we group under the name of\r\nphilanthropy, must realize the infinite diversity there is in the field\r\nof social work. Each man can, of course, do best if he takes up that\r\nbranch of work to which his tastes and his interests lead him, and the\r\nfield is of such large size that there is more than ample room for\r\nevery variety of workman. Of course there are certain attributes which\r\nmust be possessed in common by all who want to do well. The worker must\r\npossess not only resolution, firmness of purpose, broad charity, and\r\ngreat-hearted sympathy, but he must also possess common-sense sanity,\r\nand a wholesome aversion alike to the merely sentimental and the\r\nmerely spectacular. The soup-kitchen style of philanthropy is worse\r\nthan useless, for in philanthropy as everywhere else in life almost\r\nas much harm is done by soft-headedness as by hard-heartedness. The\r\nhighest type of philanthropy is that which springs from the feeling\r\nof brotherhood, and which, therefore, rests on the self-respecting,\r\nhealthy basis of mutual obligation and common effort. The best way to\r\nraise any one is to join with him in an effort whereby both you and\r\nhe are raised by each helping the other. This is what has been done\r\nin those factories in Cleveland, Dayton, Pittsburg, and elsewhere, in\r\nwhich the betterment of working life has been aimed at, and partially\r\nachieved, through measures beneficial alike to employer and employed.\r\n\r\nAny man who takes an active part in the varied, hurried, and\r\ninteresting life of New York must be struck, not only by the number\r\nof the forces which tell for evil, but by the number of the forces\r\nwhich tell for good. Of course most of these are not, in the narrow\r\nsense of the term, philanthropic forces at all; but many of them are,\r\nand among these there is the widest variety. In this paper it is only\r\npossible to touch upon a very few of the ways in which philanthropic\r\nwork of worth is being done in New York City. It is necessary to speak\r\nof individuals, because otherwise it would be impossible to emphasize\r\nthe widely different kinds of work which can thus be done. These\r\nindividuals are mentioned simply as typifying certain phases, certain\r\nmethods. There are countless others who could be mentioned; it merely\r\nhappens that these particular men have occupied to advantage certain\r\nwidely different parts of the great field of usefulness.\r\n\r\nMuch can be done in downright charitable work, and there are great\r\nfragments of our social life in which the work must be in part or in\r\nwhole charitable. The charity workers do an amount of good which in\r\nsome cases is literally inestimable. Yet, on the whole, it becomes ever\r\nincreasingly evident that the largest opportunity for work along the\r\nlines of social and civic betterment lie with the independent classes\r\nof the community--the classes which have not yielded to the many kinds\r\nof downward pressure always so strong in city life. Sometimes this work\r\nmay take the form of an organized effort to secure greater equality of\r\nopportunity. Sometimes the best way to work is the oldest and simplest;\r\nthat is, by trying the effect of character upon character.\r\n\r\nPolitical and social conditions are often closely interwoven, and\r\nalways tend to act and react upon one another. It is impossible to\r\nhave a high standard of political life in a community sunk in sodden\r\nmisery and ignorance; and where there is industrial well-being there\r\nis at least a chance of its going hand in hand with the moral and\r\nintellectual uplifting which will secure cleanliness and efficiency in\r\nthe public service. Politics have been entered by a good many different\r\ndoors, but in New York City Mr. F. Norton Goddard is probably the\r\nonly man who ever entered on the career of a district leader by the\r\ndoor of philanthropy. Mr. Goddard, feeling he ought to do something\r\nserious in life, chose a quarter on the East Side for his experiment,\r\nand he entered upon it without the slightest thought of going into\r\npolitics, simply taking a room in a tenement house with the idea of\r\ntesting his own capacities and to find out if he was fit to do what\r\nhas grown to be known as “settlement work.” He speedily became very\r\nmuch interested in the men with whom he was thrown in contact, and\r\nalso became convinced that he personally could do most by acting, not\r\nin connection with others, but for his own hand. After a few weeks he\r\njoined a small club which met at first in a single room. From this\r\none room sprang in the course of a couple of years the Civic Club at\r\n243 East Thirty-fourth Street, than which there exists in all New\r\nYork no healthier centre of energetic social and political effort.\r\nVery speedily Mr. Goddard found himself brought into hostile and\r\nembarrassing contact with that huge and highly organized system of\r\ncorruption, tempered with what may be called malevolent charity, which\r\nwe know as Tammany. Every foe of decency, from the policy player to\r\nthe protected proprietor of a law-breaking saloon, had some connection\r\nwith Tammany, and every move in any direction resulted in contact\r\nof some sort with a man or institution under Tammany’s control. Mr.\r\nGoddard soon realized that organization must be met by organization;\r\nand, being a thoroughly practical man, he started in to organize the\r\ndecent forces in such fashion as would enable him to check organized\r\nindecency. He made up his mind that the Republican party organization\r\noffered the best chance for the achievement of his object. As it then\r\nwas, however, the Republican organization of the district in question\r\nserved but little purpose save to deliver delegates in conventions,\r\nand was under the control of men who, although some degrees above the\r\nTammany leaders, had no conception of running things on the plane which\r\nGoddard deemed necessary. There were three courses open to him: He\r\ncould acquiesce helplessly; he could start an outside organization,\r\nin which case the chances were a thousand to one that it would amount\r\nto nothing; or he could make a determined effort to control for good\r\npurposes the existing Republican organization. He chose the latter\r\nalternative, and began a serious campaign to secure his object. There\r\nwas at the time a fight in the Republican organization between two\r\nfactions, both of which were headed by professional politicians. Both\r\nfactions at the outset looked upon Goddard’s methods with amused\r\ncontempt, expecting that he would go the gait which they had seen\r\nso many other young men go, where they lacked either persistency or\r\nhard common-sense. But Goddard was a practical man. He spent his days\r\nand evenings in perfecting his own organization, using the Civic\r\nClub as a centre. He already had immense influence in the district,\r\nthanks to what he had done in the Civic Club, and at this, his first\r\neffort, he was able to make an organization which, while it could\r\nnot have availed against the extraordinary drill and discipline of\r\nTammany, was able overwhelmingly to beat the far feebler machine of\r\nthe regular Republican politicians. At the primary he got more votes\r\nthan both his antagonists put together. No man outside of politics can\r\nrealize the paralyzed astonishment with which the result was viewed\r\nby the politicians in every other Assembly district. Here at last\r\nwas a reformer whose aspirations took exceedingly efficient shape as\r\ndeeds; who knew what could and what could not be done; who was never\r\ncontent with less than the possible best, but who never threw away that\r\npossible best because it was not the ideal best; who did not try to\r\nreform the universe, but merely his own district; and who understood\r\nthoroughly that though speeches and essays are good, downright hard\r\nwork of the common-sense type is infinitely better.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to preserve the fruits of a victory than to\r\nwin the victory. Mr. Goddard did both. A year later, when the\r\nold-school professional politicians attempted to oust him from his\r\nparty leadership in the district association, he beat them more\r\noverwhelmingly than before; and when the Republican National Convention\r\ncame around he went still further afield, beat out his opponents in\r\nthe Congressional district, and sent two delegates to Philadelphia.\r\nNor was his success confined to the primary. In both the years of his\r\nleadership he has enormously increased the Republican vote in his\r\ndistrict, doing better relatively than any other district leader in\r\nthe city. He does this by adopting the social methods of Tammany, only\r\nusing them along clean lines. The Tammany leader keeps his hold by\r\nincessant watchfulness over every element, and almost every voter, in\r\nhis district. Neither his objects nor his methods are good; but he does\r\ntake a great deal of pains, and he is obliged to do much charitable\r\nwork; although it is not benevolence of a healthy kind. Mr. Goddard\r\nwas already, through the Civic Club, doing just this kind of work, on\r\na thoroughly healthy basis. Going into politics had immensely helped\r\nwith the club, for it had given a great common interest to all of the\r\nmen. Of course Goddard could have done nothing if he had not approached\r\nhis work in a genuine American spirit of entire respect for himself and\r\nfor those with whom and for whom he labored. Any condescension, any\r\npatronizing spirit would have spoiled everything. But the spirit which\r\nexacts respect and yields it, which is anxious always to help in a mood\r\nof simple brotherhood, and which is glad to accept help in return--this\r\nis the spirit which enables men of every degree of wealth and of widely\r\nvarying social conditions to work together in heartiest good-will, and\r\nto the immense benefit of all. It is thus that Mr. Goddard has worked.\r\nHis house is in the district and he is in close touch with every one.\r\nIf a man is sick with pneumonia, some member of the Civic Club promptly\r\ncomes around to consult Goddard as to what hospital he shall be taken\r\nto. If another man is down on his luck, it is Goddard who helps him\r\nalong through the hard times. If a boy has been wild and got into\r\ntrouble and gone to the penitentiary, it is Goddard who is appealed to\r\nto see whether anything can be done for him. The demands upon his time\r\nand patience are innumerable. The reward, it is to be supposed, must\r\ncome from the consciousness of doing well work which is emphatically\r\nwell worth doing. A very shrewd politician said the other day that if\r\nthere were twenty such men as Goddard in twenty such districts as his\r\nNew York City would be saved from Tammany, and that in the process\r\nthe Republican machine would be made heartily responsive to and\r\nrepresentative of the best sentiment of the Republicans of the several\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nThe University Settlements do an enormous amount of work. As has been\r\nwell said, they demand on the part of those who work in them infinitely\r\nmore than the sacrifice of almsgiving, for they demand a helping hand\r\nin that progress which for the comfort of all must be given to all;\r\nthey help people to help themselves, not only in work and self-support,\r\nbut in right thinking and right living. It would be hard to mention any\r\nform of civic effort for righteousness which has not received efficient\r\naid from Mr. James B. Reynolds and his fellow-workers in the University\r\nSettlements. They have stood for the forces of good in politics,\r\nin social life, in warring against crime, in increasing the sum of\r\nmaterial pleasures. They work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, with\r\nthose whom they seek to benefit, and they themselves share in the\r\nbenefit. They make their house the centre for all robust agencies for\r\nsocial betterment. They have consistently endeavored to work with,\r\nrather than merely for, the community; to co-operate in honorable\r\nfriendship with all who are struggling upward. Only those who know the\r\nappalling conditions of life in the swarming tenements that surround\r\nthe University Settlement can appreciate what it has done. It has\r\nalmost inevitably gone into politics now and then, and whenever it has\r\ndone so has exercised a thoroughly healthy influence. It has offered\r\nto the people of the neighborhood educational and social opportunities\r\nranging from a dancing academy and musical classes, to literary clubs,\r\na library, and a children’s bank--the clubs being administered on the\r\nprinciple of self-management and self-government. It has diligently\r\nundertaken to co-operate with all local organizations such as\r\ntrades-unions, benefit societies, social clubs, and the like, provided\r\nonly that their purposes were decent. The Settlement has always desired\r\nto co-operate with independent forces rather than merely to lead or\r\ndirect the dependent forces of society. Its work in co-operation with\r\ntrades-unions has been of special value both in helping them where they\r\nhave done good work, and in endeavoring to check any tendency to evil\r\nin any particular union. It has, for instance, consistently labored\r\nto secure the settlement of strikes by consultation or arbitration,\r\nbefore the bitterness has become so great as to prevent any chance\r\nof a settlement. All this is aside from its work of sociological\r\ninvestigation and its active co-operation with those public officials\r\nwho, like the late Colonel Waring, desired such aid.\r\n\r\nHealthy political endeavor should, of course, be one form of social\r\nwork. This truth is not recognized as it should be. Perhaps, also,\r\nthere is some, though a far lesser, failure to recognize that a living\r\nchurch organization should, more than any other, be a potent force in\r\nsocial uplifting. Churches are needed for all sorts and conditions of\r\nmen under every kind of circumstances; but surely the largest field of\r\nusefulness is open to that church in which the spirit of brotherhood\r\nis a living and vital force, and not a cold formula; in which the rich\r\nand poor gather together to aid one another in work for a common end.\r\nBrother can best help brother, not by almsgiving, but by joining with\r\nhim in an intelligent and resolute effort for the uplifting of all. It\r\nis towards this that St. George’s Church, under Dr. W. S. Rainsford,\r\nhas steadily worked. The membership of St. George’s Church is in a\r\ngreat majority composed of working people--and young working people\r\nat that. It is a free church with a membership of over four thousand,\r\nmost of the members having come in by way of the Sunday-school.\r\nLarge sums of money are raised, not from a few people, but from the\r\nmany. An honest effort has been made to study the conditions of life\r\nin the neighborhood, and through the church to remedy those which\r\nwere abnormal. One of the troubles on the East Side is the lack of\r\nopportunity for young people, boys and girls, to meet save where the\r\nsurroundings are unfavorable to virtue. In St. George’s Church this\r\nneed is, so far as can be, met by meetings--debating societies, clubs,\r\nsocial entertainments, etc., in the large parish building. Years ago\r\nthe dances needed to be policed by chosen ladies and gentlemen and\r\nclergymen. Now the whole standard of conduct has been so raised that\r\nthe young people conduct their own entertainments as they see fit.\r\nThere is a large athletic club and industrial school, a boys’ battalion\r\nand men’s club; there are sewing classes, cooking classes, and a\r\ngymnasium for working girls. Dr. Rainsford’s staff includes both men\r\nand women, the former living at the top of the parish house, the latter\r\nin the little deaconess-house opposite. Every effort is made to keep in\r\nclose touch with wage-workers, and this not merely for their benefit,\r\nbut quite as much for the benefit of those who are brought in touch\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe church is, of all places, that in which men should meet on the\r\nbasis of their common humanity under conditions of sympathy and mutual\r\nself-respect. All must work alike in the church in order to get the\r\nfull benefit from it; but it is not the less true that we have a\r\npeculiar right to expect systematic effort from men and women of\r\neducation and leisure. Such people should justify by their work the\r\nconditions of society which have rendered possible their leisure, their\r\neducation, and their wealth. Money can never take the place of service,\r\nand though here and there it is absolutely necessary to have the paid\r\nworker, yet normally he is not an adequate substitute for the volunteer.\r\n\r\nOf course St. George’s Church has not solved all the social problems\r\nin the immediate neighborhood which is the field of its special\r\neffort. But it has earnestly tried to solve some at least, and it\r\nhas achieved a very substantial measure of success towards their\r\nsolution. Perhaps, after all, the best work done has been in connection\r\nwith the development of the social side of the church organization.\r\nReasonable opportunities for social intercourse are an immense moral\r\nsafeguard, and young people of good character and steady habits should\r\nbe encouraged to meet under conditions which are pleasant and which\r\nalso tell for decency. The work of a down-town church in New York\r\nCity presents difficulties that are unique, but it also presents\r\nopportunities that are unique. In the case of St. George’s Church it\r\nis only fair to say that the difficulties have been overcome, and the\r\nopportunities taken advantage of, to the utmost.\r\n\r\nAside from the various kinds of work outlined above, where the main\r\nelement is the coming together of people for the purpose of helping\r\none another to rise higher, there is, of course, a very large field\r\nfor charitable work proper. For such work there must be thorough\r\norganization of the kind supplied, for instance, by the State Charities\r\nAid Association. Here, again, the average outsider would be simply\r\nastounded to learn of the amount actually accomplished every year by\r\nthe association.\r\n\r\nA peculiar and exceedingly desirable form of work, originally purely\r\ncharitable, although not now as exclusively so, is that of the Legal\r\nAid Society, founded by Arthur von Briesen. It was founded to try to\r\nremedy the colossal injustice which was so often encountered by the\r\npoorest and most ignorant immigrants; it has been extended to shield\r\nevery class, native and foreign. There are always among the poor and\r\nneedy thousands of helpless individuals who are preyed upon by sharpers\r\nof different degrees. If very poor, they may have no means whatever\r\nof obtaining redress; and, especially if they are foreigners ignorant\r\nof the language, they may also be absolutely ignorant as to what\r\nsteps should be taken in order to right the wrong that has been done\r\nthem. The injuries that are done may seem trivial; but they are not\r\ntrivial to the sufferers, and the aggregate amount of misery caused\r\nis enormous. The Legal Aid Society has made it its business to take\r\nup these cases and secure justice. Every conceivable variety of case\r\nis attended to. The woman who has been deserted or maltreated by her\r\nhusband, the poor serving-maid who has been swindled out of her wages,\r\nthe ignorant immigrant who has fallen a victim to some sharper, the\r\nman of no knowledge of our language or laws who has been arrested for\r\ndoing something which he supposed was entirely proper--all these and\r\ncountless others like them apply for relief, and have it granted in\r\ntens of thousands of cases every year. It should be remembered that\r\nthe good done is not merely to the sufferers themselves, it is also a\r\ngood done to society, for it leaves in the mind of the newcomer to our\r\nshores, not the rankling memory of wrong and injustice, but the feeling\r\nthat, after all, here in the New World, where he has come to seek his\r\nfortune, there are disinterested men who endeavor to see that the right\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nSome men can do their best work in an organization. Some, though they\r\noccasionally work in an organization, can do best by themselves.\r\nRecently a man well qualified to pass judgment alluded to Mr. Jacob A.\r\nRiis as “the most useful citizen of New York.” Those fellow-citizens\r\nof Mr. Riis who best know his work will be most apt to agree with this\r\nstatement. The countless evils which lurk in the dark corners of our\r\ncivic institutions, which stalk abroad in the slums, and have their\r\npermanent abode in the crowded tenement houses, have met in Mr. Riis\r\nthe most formidable opponent ever encountered by them in New York City.\r\nMany earnest men and earnest women have been stirred to the depths by\r\nthe want and misery and foul crime which are bred in the crowded blocks\r\nof tenement rookeries. These men and women have planned and worked,\r\nintelligently and resolutely, to overcome the evils. But to Mr. Riis\r\nwas given, in addition to earnestness and zeal, the great gift of\r\nexpression, the great gift of making others see what he saw and feel\r\nwhat he felt. His book, _How the Other Half Lives_, did really go a\r\nlong way toward removing the ignorance in which one half of the world\r\nof New York dwelt concerning the life of the other half. Moreover, Mr.\r\nRiis possessed the further great advantage of having himself passed\r\nthrough not a few of the experiences of which he had to tell. Landing\r\nhere, a young Danish lad, he had for years gone through the hard\r\nstruggle that so often attends even the bravest and best when they go\r\nout without money to seek their fortunes in a strange and alien land.\r\nThe horror of the police lodging-houses struck deep in his soul, for\r\nhe himself had lodged in them. The brutality of some of the police he\r\nhad himself experienced. He had been mishandled, and had seen the stray\r\ndog which was his only friend killed for trying in dumb friendship to\r\ntake his part. He had known what it was to sleep on door-steps and go\r\ndays in succession without food. All these things he remembered, and\r\nhis work as a reporter on the New York _Sun_ has enabled him in the\r\nexercise of his profession to add to his knowledge. There are certain\r\nqualities the reformer must have if he is to be a real reformer and\r\nnot merely a faddist; for of course every reformer is in continual\r\ndanger of slipping into the mass of well-meaning people who in their\r\nadvocacy of the impracticable do more harm than good. He must possess\r\nhigh courage, disinterested desire to do good, and sane, wholesome\r\ncommon-sense. These qualities he must have, and it is furthermore much\r\nto his benefit if he also possesses a sound sense of humor. All four\r\ntraits are possessed by Jacob Riis. No rebuff, no seeming failure, has\r\never caused him to lose faith. The memory of his own trials never\r\nsoured him. His keen sense of the sufferings of others never clouded\r\nhis judgment, never led him into hysterical or sentimental excess, the\r\npit into which not a few men are drawn by the very keenness of their\r\nsympathies; and which some other men avoid, not because they are wise,\r\nbut because they are cold-hearted. He ever advocates mercy, but he\r\never recognizes the need of justice. The mob leader, the bomb-thrower,\r\nhave no sympathy from him. No man has ever insisted more on the danger\r\nwhich comes to the community from the lawbreaker. He sets himself to\r\nkill the living evil, and small is his kinship with the dreamers who\r\nseek the impossible, the men who _talk_ of reconstituting the entire\r\nsocial order, but who do not _work_ to lighten the burden of mankind\r\nby so much as a feather’s weight. Every man who strives, be it ever so\r\nfeebly, to do good according to the light that is in him, can count on\r\nthe aid of Jacob Riis if the chance comes. Whether the man is a public\r\nofficial, like Colonel Waring, seeking to raise some one branch of the\r\ncity government; whether he is interested in a boys’ club up in the\r\ncountry; or in a scheme for creating small parks in the city; or in an\r\neffort to better the conditions of tenement-house life--no matter what\r\nhis work is, so long as his work is useful, he can count on the aid of\r\nthe man who perhaps more than any other knows the needs of the varied\r\npeople who make up the great bulk of New York’s population.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen men have been mentioned, each only as a type of those who\r\nin the seething life of the great city do, in their several ways and\r\naccording to their strength and varying capacities, strive to do their\r\nduty to their neighbor. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to\r\nthe way in which such work must be done; but most certainly every man,\r\nwhatever his position, should strive to do it in some way and to some\r\ndegree. If he strives earnestly he will benefit himself probably quite\r\nas much as he benefits others, and he will inevitably learn a great\r\ndeal. At first it may be an effort to him to cast off certain rigid\r\nconventions, but real work of any kind is a great educator, and soon\r\nhelps any man to single out the important from the unimportant. If such\r\na worker has the right stuff in him he soon grows to accept without\r\neffort each man on his worth as a man, and to disregard his means, and\r\nwhat is called his social position; to care little whether he is a\r\nCatholic or Protestant, a Jew or a Gentile; to be utterly indifferent\r\nwhether he was born here or in Ireland, in Germany or in Scandinavia;\r\nprovided only that he has in him the spirit of sturdy common-sense and\r\nthe resolute purpose to strive after the light as it is given him to\r\nsee the light.\r\n\r\n                            [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Reprinted, by permission, from _McClure’s Magazine_.
