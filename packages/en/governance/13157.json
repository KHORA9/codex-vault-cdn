Following the maxim of Confucius that it is well \"to study\r\nthe Past if you would divine the Future,\" I have first shown that the\r\ntales which are told about the glories of the ancient Celtic\r\nKingdom are foolish dreams, not supported by the accounts given by\r\ncontemporary annalists or the investigations of modern writers, and\r\nthat Ireland never was a nation in the political sense, with the\r\npossible exception of the few years between 1782 and 1800, during\r\nwhich the Irish Parliament was independent; that the charges made\r\nagainst the English government with reference to their action between\r\nthe \"Conquest\" by Henry II and the assumption of the title of King\r\nby Henry VIII are baseless; and that though there is much which the\r\nhistorian must look back upon with regret in the period between the\r\nreign of Henry VIII and the passing of the Act of Union, it is mere\r\nwaste of time now to dwell on the wrongs of a former age which\r\nhave long since passed away and which in any other country would be\r\nforgotten. Then I have traced the brief history of the independent\r\nParliament, and shown that whatever may have been its virtues or\r\nits failings, it would be impossible to revive it now; all the\r\ncircumstances of the country have changed. I have striven also to make\r\nit clear that the Nationalists of to-day are not the representatives\r\nof the leaders of that Parliament but of the party which fought\r\nagainst it and brought on the horrors of the Rebellion; that the\r\nUnion was a political necessity, if the connection between the British\r\nIslands was to be maintained at all; and that if the people of Ireland\r\nhave not derived all the benefits from the Union which they might have\r\ndone, it is their own fault, as the history of Ulster during the last\r\ncentury has shown. Next, I have explained the rise of the present\r\nHome Rule movement, and its dependence on agrarian agitation. I have\r\nanalyzed some of the provisions of the present Bill, which independent\r\nwriters consider to be hopelessly unworkable; and lastly I have stated\r\nwhy in my opinion Home Rule in any form must be fraught with disaster\r\nnot only to Ireland but also to the Empire at large.\r\n\r\nI have no desire unnecessarily to wound the feelings of those who take\r\na different view; if it can be shown that any of my statements are\r\nincorrect or my inference illogical, I shall be glad to correct\r\nthem; but to mere abuse, such as the Nationalists are in the habit of\r\npouring on Unionist writers, I shall pay no heed. I admit that it may\r\nbe said that there are several matters which I ought to have gone into\r\nmore fully; to that I can only reply that I wished to be as brief as\r\npossible, and that I have done my best to compress with fairness.\r\nWhat I am really anxious to do is to draw the attention of thoughtful\r\nreaders, before it is too late, to the terrible dangers with which we\r\nare faced. As an Irish historian has said:--\r\n\r\n    \"No political madness could be greater than to put the\r\n    legislative machinery of an integral and essential portion\r\n    of the Empire into the hands of men who are largely or mainly\r\n    disaffected with that Empire, and who, in times of difficulty,\r\n    danger and disaster are likely to betray it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal works of which use has been made\r\nin preparing this volume. They are cited here in order to avoid the\r\nnecessity of constant footnotes:--\r\n\r\n    \"Short History of the Irish People.\" By Professor Richey.\r\n\r\n    \"Irish Nationalism.\" By the late Duke of Argyll.\r\n\r\n    \"History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century.\" By W.E.H.\r\n    Lecky.\r\n\r\n    \"History of the Legislative Union of Great Britain and\r\n    Ireland.\" By Dunbar Ingram.\r\n\r\n    \"Ireland and Her Fairy Godmother.\" By J. Warren.\r\n\r\n    \"The Continuity of the Irish Revolutionary Movement.\" By Prof.\r\n    Brougham Leech.\r\n\r\n    \"A Fool's Paradise.\" By Professor Dicey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE ULSTER COVENANT. THE QUESTIONS STATED. IRELAND UNDER THE CELTS AND\r\nTHE DANES.\r\n\r\n    \"Being convinced in our consciences that Home Rule would be\r\n    disastrous to the material well-being of Ulster as well as of\r\n    the whole of Ireland, subversive of our civil and religious\r\n    freedom, destructive of our citizenship and perilous to the\r\n    unity of the Empire, We, whose names are underwritten, Men of\r\n    Ulster, loyal subjects of His Gracious Majesty King George V,\r\n    humbly relying on the God whom our fathers in days of stress\r\n    and trial confidently trusted, do hereby pledge ourselves\r\n    in Solemn Covenant throughout this our time of threatened\r\n    calamity to stand by one another in defending for ourselves\r\n    and our children our cherished position of equal citizenship\r\n    in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be\r\n    found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a\r\n    Home Rule Parliament in Ireland. And, in the event of such\r\n    a Parliament being forced upon us, we further solemnly\r\n    and mutually pledge ourselves to refuse to recognise its\r\n    authority. In such confidence that God will defend the right,\r\n    we hereunto subscribe our names.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the Solemn Covenant which 220,000 resolute, determined\r\nUlstermen--of various creeds and of all sections of the community,\r\nfrom wealthy merchants to farm labourers--fully realizing the\r\nresponsibility they were undertaking, signed on the 28th September,\r\n1912. To represent that it was merely the idle bombast of ignorant\r\nrustics, or a passing ebullition of political passion coming from\r\nhot-headed youths excited by irresponsible demagogues, is folly.\r\nIt expresses the calm resolution of earnest men who, having thought\r\ndeeply over the matter had decided that it was better even to face\r\nthe horrors of civil war rather than to submit to the rule of a\r\nNationalist Government.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the Nationalists with regard to the Ulster Covenant\r\ncan be gathered from many speeches and sermons. The following extract\r\nfrom one of their papers--the _Frontier Sentinel_--may be taken as a\r\nspecimen:--\r\n\r\n    \"It may not be out of place here to translate into simple\r\n    English the terms of the Covenant. It denies the claim of\r\n    Ireland to self-government and the capacity of Irishmen to\r\n    govern Ireland. It asserts that the Catholics of Ireland are\r\n    the spawn of the devil; that they are ruthless savages and\r\n    dangerous criminals with only one object in life--the wiping\r\n    out of Protestants. It claims for the Protestant Unionist\r\n    majority of four Ulster counties a monopoly of Christianity,\r\n    public and private morality, and clean successful business\r\n    enterprise. In the name of God it seeks to stimulate the\r\n    basest passions in human nature, and calls on God to witness\r\n    a catalogue of falsehoods. Only a few of the local Protestant\r\n    clergymen, it should be stated, signed this notoriously wicked\r\n    document.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well then to pause and consider calmly two questions: What\r\nare the real objects of the Nationalists; and, Are the men of Ulster\r\njustified in resisting them to the uttermost?\r\n\r\nIt is a mere truism to remark that in every political question the\r\nmain controversy is complicated by a number of side issues. Thus in\r\nthe tangled skein of politics in South Eastern Europe there is not\r\nmerely the great struggle between the Crescent and the Cross, but\r\nthere are also jealousies between Greek and Bulgarian, between Servian\r\nand Austrian, which have to be considered. So in Ireland, if we\r\ntake the religious question as the dominating one, we find ourselves\r\ninvolved in a maze of racial animosities, class prejudices, and\r\ntrade disputes; by ignoring these we can arrive at a simple but\r\nunfortunately a totally erroneous solution of the question. And to\r\nweigh them all fairly involves more trouble than the average man cares\r\nto take.\r\n\r\nIrish history is at best a dismal subject. And those who ought to\r\nbe historians are too often politicians; regarding themselves as\r\nadvocates and not as judges they deliberately omit incidents which\r\ntell against their views, and enlarge on others, frequently without\r\neven examining the evidence in support of them. Then in arriving\r\nat the truth about any matter connected with Ireland there is the\r\nadditional difficulty arising from the custom, almost universal\r\namongst Irishmen, of talking in superlatives. The exaggerated\r\nexpressions, both of praise and blame, which are constantly employed,\r\nat first puzzle a stranger coming to Ireland from another country; he\r\nsoon, however, gets to realize that they are mere forms of speech, and\r\nare no more intended to be taken seriously than similar phrases are\r\nwhen used by an Oriental. They are therefore harmless. But it becomes\r\na more serious matter when learned men employ inflated language in\r\naddressing ignorant and excitable audiences. Thus Bishop Gaughran,\r\nwhen recently preaching to a crowded congregation in Dublin a sermon\r\nwhich was reported in full in the Roman Catholic papers, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"The persecution of the Catholics in Ireland had no parallel\r\n    in the history of the Church save perhaps those of the early\r\n    Christians in the Catacombs of Rome. Edicts were sent\r\n    forth before which those of Nero might be said to pale into\r\n    insignificance--the Edicts of Elizabeth and Cromwell, for\r\n    example.\"\r\n\r\nYet these words came from a man who was doubtless familiar with the\r\nhistories of Spain, Portugal, France and the Netherlands; and who is a\r\nleader of a party which had not long before expressed the opinion that\r\nCatholics have no reason to be ashamed of the Inquisition, which was\r\na coercive and corporally punitive force which had effected its ends\r\nsplendidly!\r\n\r\nOne of the many popular delusions under which English people labour\r\nwith regard to Ireland is that all the population of the country at\r\nthe present day are Celts, and that this is the key to the whole Irish\r\nquestion. Thus a review of Father Tyrrell's autobiography recently\r\nappeared in an English journal in which the reviewer said: \"Probably\r\nno Englishmen could have written such a book; it needs a Latin like\r\nRousseau, or a Celt like Tyrrell to lay bare his soul in this way.\"\r\nNo doubt these words were written in perfectly good faith; but if\r\nthe writer had cared to make any enquiry he could have found out in a\r\nmoment that the Tyrrell family were thoroughly English and that none\r\nof them had gone to Ireland before the nineteenth century. The fact\r\nis that the inhabitants of Ireland, like the inhabitants of all other\r\ncountries in Western Europe, are of mixed origin. The Celts were\r\nthemselves immigrants, who conquered and enslaved a pre-existing race\r\ncalled the Firbolgs; then came the Scandinavian invasion; and then\r\nwave after wave of immigration from England and Scotland, so that\r\nSir J. Davies, writing three hundred years ago--that was, before the\r\nCromwellian settlement and the arrival of the French refugees who had\r\nescaped from the persecution of Louis XIV--said that if the people of\r\nIreland were numbered those descended of English race would be found\r\nmore in number than the ancient natives.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is only one of many errors into which English writers\r\nhave fallen. Mistakes of course will always be made; but unfortunately\r\nit is a charge from which Mr. Gladstone's admirers cannot clear him\r\nthat when he wished to bring the English people round to the idea of\r\nHome Rule he deliberately falsified Irish history in order to make\r\nit serve his ends; and his misrepresentations have gained credence\r\namongst careless thinkers who are content to shelter themselves under\r\na great name without looking at what has been written in answer. The\r\ngeneral idea of an average Englishman about Irish history seems to be\r\nthat Ireland in Celtic times was a peaceful, orderly, united kingdom,\r\nfamous for its piety and learning, where land was held by \"tribal\r\ntenure\"--that is, owned by the whole tribe who were closely related\r\nin blood--rent being unknown, and the chief being elected by the whole\r\ntribe in solemn assembly. Into this happy country came the Norman\r\ninvaders, who fought against and conquered the king; drove the native\r\nowners out of their possessions, and introduced a feudal system and an\r\nalien code of law unsuited to the people; and the modern landlords\r\nare the representatives of the conquering Normans and the tenants\r\nthe descendants of the ancient tribesmen who naturally and rightfully\r\nresist paying rent for the lands which by ancestral right should be\r\ntheir own. There could not be a more complete travesty of history.\r\n\r\nThe Celtic Church no doubt had its golden age. It produced saints and\r\nmen of learning. It sent out its missionaries to the heathen beyond\r\nthe seas. So famous were its schools that students came to them from\r\ndistant lands. But centuries before the Normans appeared in Ireland\r\nthe salt had lost its savour. The Celtic Church had sunk into being\r\na mere appendage of the wild tribes it had once tried to tame. The\r\nchiefs of one tribe would sack the colleges and shrines of another\r\ntribe as freely as they would sack any of their other possessions.\r\nFor instance, the annals tell us that in the year 1100 the men of the\r\nsouth made a raid into Connaught and burned many churches; in 1113\r\nMunster tribe burned many churches in Meath, one of them being full of\r\npeople; in 1128 the septs of Leitrim and Cavan plundered and slew the\r\nretinue of the Bishop of Armagh; in the same year the men of Tyrone\r\nraided Down and a great number of people suffered martyrdom; four\r\nyears later Kildare was invaded by raiders from Wexford, the church\r\nwas burnt and many men slain; and so on with dreary monotony. Bishops\r\nand abbots fought in the incessant tribal wars as keenly as laymen.\r\nWorse still, it was not infrequent for one band of clergy to make\r\nwar on another. In the ninth century, Phelim, who claimed to be both\r\nBishop and King of Leinster, ravaged Ulster and murdered its monks and\r\nclergy. In the eleventh century the annals give an account of a fierce\r\nbattle between the Bishop of Armagh and the Bishop of Clonard. Nor did\r\ntime work any improvement; we read of bloody conflicts between abbots\r\nand bishops as late as the middle of the fifteenth century. What\r\ninfluence for good could such a church have had upon the mass of the\r\npeople?\r\n\r\nAnd even in its noblest period the Celtic Church seems to have had but\r\nlittle power beyond the walls of its own colleges. The whole history\r\nof Celtic Ireland, as we learn from the annalists, was one miserable\r\nsuccession of tribal wars, murders and plunderings. Of course it may\r\nbe said with perfect truth that the annals of other countries at the\r\ntime tell much the same story. But there is this difference between\r\nthem: wild and barbarous though the wars of other countries were,\r\nthey were at any rate the slow and painful working up towards a higher\r\ncivilization; the country became consolidated under the most powerful\r\nchief; in time peace was enforced, agriculture improved, and towns\r\ngrew up. The tribal raids of Celtic Ireland, however, were merely\r\nfor plunder and destruction. From such conflicts no higher state of\r\nsociety could possibly be evolved. The Irish Celts built no cities,\r\npromoted no agriculture, and never coalesced so as to form even the\r\nnucleus of a united kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt was about the end of the eighth century that the first foreign\r\ninfluence was brought to bear on Celtic Ireland. The Danish invasion\r\nbegan. Heathen though the Danes were, they brought some ideas of\r\nsettled government and the germs of national progress. They founded\r\ncities, such as Dublin, Waterford and Limerick. And when they, like\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen in England, accepted Christianity, they\r\nestablished bishoprics in the new towns, but took care that they\r\nshould be wholly independent of the Celtic tribal episcopate; they\r\nlooked to Canterbury and Rome.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written and sung about the fame of Brian Boroo. No doubt\r\nhe was in some ways a great man; and it seemed for a time that he\r\nmight do for Ireland something like what Alfred the Great had done for\r\nEngland and Kenneth MacAlpine had done for Scotland--might consolidate\r\nthe country into one kingdom. But the story of his life is a striking\r\ncommentary on the wretchedness of the period. Forming an alliance with\r\nsome of the Danes he succeeded in crushing the chiefs of several rival\r\nCeltic tribes; then in turn he attacked his former allies, and beat\r\nthem at the battle of Clontarf in the year 1014, though they were\r\naided by other Celtic tribes who hated Brian and his schemes even more\r\nthan they hated the foreigners. Important though this battle was, its\r\neffect has been much exaggerated and misunderstood. It certainly\r\ndid not bring the Danish power in Ireland to an end; Dublin was a\r\nflourishing Danish colony long afterwards--in fact it was thirty years\r\nafter the battle that the Danish king of Dublin founded the Bishopric.\r\n\r\nBut Brian was slain in the moment of victory. The soldiers of his\r\narmy murdered his only surviving son, and began fighting amongst\r\nthemselves. Brian's dream of a united Ireland came to an end, and the\r\ncountry relapsed into chaos. If the immediate result of the battle\r\nwas a victory of Celt over Dane, the lasting effect was a triumph of\r\nanarchy over order. It was on the Celtic people that the ruin fell;\r\nand the state of things for the next two centuries was if possible\r\nworse than it had ever been before.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that throughout this terrible period of\r\nhistory anything like a peaceful cultivation of the soil or a regular\r\nelection to the office of chief was out of the question. It was quite\r\nan ordinary thing for a chief to obtain his position by murdering his\r\npredecessor. The annalists give us a long list of Kings of Ireland\r\ndating from before the Christian era until the arrival of the Normans.\r\nOf course the word \"king\" can mean little more than \"prominent\r\nchief,\" for no one man ever had real authority over the whole of the\r\ndistracted land. Even of these prominent chiefs, however, according\r\nto the annalists, very few died natural deaths. Some fell in battle,\r\nothers were assassinated; but the most common fate for a monarch was\r\nto be \"slain by his successor.\" If this was true of the most powerful\r\nmen in the country, to speak of the office of chief as elective is\r\nreally absurd. But more than this: there is no evidence that the\r\n\"tribal system,\" in the sense of all the tribe being related by blood\r\nand all owning their lands in common, ever existed in Ireland even\r\nin theory. At the earliest date of which we possess any distinct\r\ninformation on the subject, wealth, representing physical force, had\r\nbecome the acknowledged basis of political power and private right;\r\nand the richer members of the community were rapidly reducing the\r\npoorer freemen--many of whom were the descendants of an earlier race\r\nor of conquered tribes--to a state of serfdom. The system (if such\r\na word can be applied at all) was in fact a bad form of feudalism\r\nwithout its advantages. There was no central overlord (like those\r\nin other countries who gradually developed into the sovereigns of\r\nmediæval kingdoms and thus became able to enforce peace and progress),\r\neach petty chief being independent; and on the other hand the dues\r\npayable by the retainers were not fixed by law or custom. We must\r\nprobably reject the suggested derivation of the word \"feodal\" from the\r\nCeltic \"Fiudir\"; but if so, it is curious that two words accidentally\r\nresembling each other conveyed ideas so closely alike; for a Celtic\r\n\"Fiudir\" was practically a tenant at the will of the lord; and it must\r\nbe admitted that the word \"vassal\" is of Celtic origin. Charters which\r\ndate from before the Norman invasion show that the land was regarded\r\nas the private property of the chiefs; frequently the wretched\r\noccupiers, instead of paying fixed rents, were liable to unlimited\r\nexactions, one of them being the right of the lord to \"coigne and\r\nlivery\"--that is, to quarter himself and his retainers as long as he\r\npleased on any occupier who possessed a few cows (which were the only\r\nform of wealth in those days of universal poverty); in some cases,\r\nhowever, land was let for a term of years, on a fixed payment of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nOn the death of a freeholder his land was divided amongst his sons\r\nequally, according to what is called \"the custom of gavelkind.\"\r\nWhether primogeniture is a good or a bad thing in England or the\r\nBritish Colonies at the present day is of course a totally different\r\nquestion; the circumstances of the times are totally different. But\r\nit can hardly be doubted by a thoughtful student of history that the\r\nadoption of primogeniture in the early days of feudalism in other\r\nEuropean countries was a social necessity if civilization was to rise\r\nto a higher state; and that its not being introduced in Ireland was if\r\nnot a cause at least an evidence that civilization in that country\r\ndid not progress. For in a condition not far removed from anarchy\r\nthe connection between the ownership of land and political power is\r\ninevitable; hence if holdings are small their owners become an easy\r\nprey to stronger neighbours; whereas the possessors of larger areas\r\ncan repel attacks and enable their dependents to live in some sort of\r\nsecurity. It was the enormous number of petty independent chiefs that\r\nadded to the miseries of Celtic Ireland.\r\n\r\nI shall probably be accused of having painted too dark a picture in\r\nthe brief sketch that I have given of Ireland before the coming of the\r\nNormans. I admit that it is very different from the glowing accounts\r\nof \"Irish Ireland\" that may be found in the pages of Nationalist\r\njournals. But the question to me is not which account is more pleasant\r\nbut which is true. And I defy anyone who has cared to look through the\r\nworks of such writers as Richey, Stokes, and Sullivan, to prove that\r\nwhat I have said is incorrect or unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nIRELAND FROM THE TIME OF HENRY II TO THE TIME OF HENRY VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I dealt with the long period during which the\r\nCeltic tribes of Ireland were free from foreign influence except for\r\nthe comparatively brief time when a small part of the country was\r\nunder the rule of the Danes; and I endeavoured to show that according\r\nto the evidence of their own annalists and in the opinion of modern\r\nwriters of various political sentiments, the whole island throughout\r\nthat period remained in a chronic state of anarchy, without any\r\nadvance towards a higher civilization.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Richey, when describing the condition of Ireland about the year\r\n1170, says, \"The state of the Celtic people was beyond all hope of\r\nself-amendment. The want of law, order and justice, the absence of\r\nself-knowledge and self-control, paralysed their national action and\r\nreduced the power of their chief king to insignificance.\"\r\n\r\nI come now to what has been absurdly called the conquest of Ireland\r\nunder Henry II.\r\n\r\nThat the English king was instigated in his efforts by the Pope is\r\nperfectly clear. The Bull of Pope Adrian, issued in 1155, is still\r\nextant:--\r\n\r\n    \"... There is indeed no doubt but that Ireland, and all the\r\n    islands on which Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, hath shone,\r\n    and which have received the doctrine of the Christian faith,\r\n    do belong to the jurisdiction of St. Peter and the Holy Roman\r\n    Church ... therefore we are the more solicitous to propagate\r\n    the righteous plantation of faith in this land, and the\r\n    branch acceptable to God, as we have the secret conviction of\r\n    conscience that this is more especially our bounden duty. You\r\n    then, our dear son in Christ, have signified to us your desire\r\n    to enter into the island of Ireland, in order to reduce the\r\n    people to obedience under the laws, and to extirpate the\r\n    plants of vice, and that you are willing to pay from each\r\n    house a yearly pension of one penny to St. Peter, and that you\r\n    will preserve the rights of the churches whole and inviolate.\r\n    We, therefore, do hold it good and acceptable that ... you\r\n    enter this island and execute therein whatever shall pertain\r\n    to the honour of God and welfare of the land; and that the\r\n    people of the land receive you honourably and reverence you as\r\n    their lord.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in 1172 Pope Alexander III ratified the action of his predecessor.\r\n\r\n    \"Forasmuch as these things which have been on good reasons\r\n    granted by our predecessors, deserve to be confirmed ...\r\n    and considering the grant of the dominion of the land by the\r\n    venerable Pope Adrian, we ... do ratify and confirm the same\r\n    (reserving to St. Peter and to the Holy Roman Church, as well\r\n    in England as in Ireland the yearly pension of one penny from\r\n    every house) provided that, the abominations of the land being\r\n    removed, the barbarous people, Christians only in name, may\r\n    by your means, be reformed, and their lives and conversations\r\n    mended, so that their disordered Church being thus reduced\r\n    to regular discipline, that nation may, with the name of\r\n    Christians, be so in act and deed.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the description here given was literally correct, or whether\r\nthe Pope's views were coloured by the fact that the Celtic Church did\r\nnot acknowledge the supremacy of Rome and was heretical on certain\r\npoints of doctrine, is a question outside the present subject. The\r\nBulls are only quoted here as showing the part taken by Rome. And it\r\nmust be admitted that in the succeeding century the power of the Pope\r\nbecame strong enough to enable him to levy taxes in Ireland for the\r\npurpose of carrying on his wars against the Emperor and the King of\r\nAragon.\r\n\r\nBut Henry did not conquer Ireland. He did not even pretend to do so.\r\nPrevious to his arrival there had been some little fighting done by a\r\nfew adventurous Norman knights who had been invited by a native chief\r\nto assist him in a domestic war; but Henry II fought no battle in\r\nIreland; he displaced no ancient national government; the Irish had\r\nno national flag, no capital city as the metropolis of the country, no\r\ncommon administration of the law. The English, coming in the name of\r\nthe Pope, with the aid of the Irish bishops, with a superior national\r\norganization which the Irish easily recognised, were accepted by the\r\nIrish. The king landed at Waterford; his journey to Dublin was rather\r\na royal progress than a hostile invasion. He came as feudal sovereign\r\nto receive the homage of the Irish tribes; the chiefs flocked to his\r\ncourt, readily became his vassals, and undertook to hold the lands\r\nthey already occupied as fiefs of the Crown. But Henry did not take\r\nthe title, or assume the position of King of Ireland. He merely sought\r\nto establish a suzerainty in which he would be the overlord. And in\r\nfact a conquest of Ireland in the modern sense of the term would have\r\nbeen impossible. England possessed no standing army; the feudal levies\r\nof mediæval times were difficult and expensive. It might of course\r\nhave been possible to have organized a wholesale immigration and an\r\nenslavement of the natives, something like that which the Normans had\r\naccomplished in England, and the Saxons had done centuries before; but\r\nnothing of the kind was attempted. Whether Henry's original intention\r\nwas simply to leave the Irish chiefs in possession or not, it is\r\nuseless now to enquire. But if it was, he appears to have changed his\r\nviews; for not long afterwards he granted large fiefs with palatinate\r\njurisdiction to various Normans who had made their way over to Ireland\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\nIt may be that Henry--knowing that the Conqueror, whilst taking\r\ncare that no powerful seignories should grow up in the heart of his\r\nkingdom, as rivals to the throne, yet made exceptions in cases\r\nwhere the lands verged on hostile territory, such as Durham or\r\nChester--thought that he could best follow the spirit of that policy\r\nby establishing what were practically semi-independent principalities\r\nin an island already inhabited by another race. But the result was\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nThat the Normans were savage and brutal, dealing out no justice or\r\nmercy to their victims, is proved by the account of their conquest of\r\nEngland. Yet they possessed certain great qualities, which eminently\r\nfitted them to become rulers in those wild, unsettled times; as their\r\nsuccesses, not merely in Britain, but also in Southern Italy and\r\nSyria, show. They had the idea of a strong, centralized Government;\r\nand more than that they had a marvellous capacity for receptivity.\r\nThus we see that in England, after a period of rough tyranny, they\r\nblended the existing Anglo-Saxon Government--the strength of which lay\r\nin its local organization--with their own; and from the union of\r\nthe two has come the British Constitution. So too in the Lowlands\r\nof Scotland it was the Norman knight Robert Bruce who, accepting the\r\nalready existing Saxon and Roman civilization, raised Scotland into a\r\npowerful kingdom. But in Ireland all was different. The only state\r\nof society which the Normans found was Celtic barbarism. Political\r\ninstitutions did not exist. As the Normans in England had become\r\nAnglified, and in Scotland Scottified, so in Ireland they became\r\nErsefied. It is true that they built stone castles which at any rate\r\nwere better than the hovels of the Irish Chiefs, and (like the\r\nDanes before them) founded a few towns, such as Kilkenny, Galway and\r\nAthenry; but there their efforts ended. Scattered amongst the tribes,\r\nthey learnt their ways. They sank to the position of the Celtic\r\nChiefs around them; local wars went on the same as before; the only\r\ndifference being that they were waged sometimes by Normans against\r\nNormans or against Celts, but more frequently by one body of Celts\r\nagainst another, each side being aided by Norman allies.\r\n\r\nOne class of Nationalist writers has inveighed against the English\r\nkings for not having forcibly introduced English law and put an end to\r\nthe barbarous Celtic customs. The simple answer is, How could they do\r\nso? Whilst England was being weakened by long continental wars or\r\nby struggles between rival Houses, what strength had she left to\r\nundertake the real conquest of Ireland? The English kings had turned\r\nto the only people who could have helped them--the Normans settled in\r\nIreland; and they failed them. Other Nationalist writers have on\r\nthe other hand declaimed with equal vehemence against the tyranny of\r\nEngland in forcing an alien system of law on an unwilling people. To\r\nthis the answer is that nothing of the kind occurred. It is true that\r\npetitions were sent from Ireland to the King urging him to introduce\r\nEnglish law; but these petitions came mainly from the poorer classes\r\nof English settlers who found that instead of attaining greater\r\nliberty in their new home they were being ground down to the miserable\r\nposition of the native Irish. The King issued proclamations directing\r\nthe English barons to permit the Irish to be governed by the law of\r\nEngland; but his orders were totally disregarded; many of the unhappy\r\nEnglish settlers fled from the country and returned to England;\r\nthe barons supplied their places with native retainers. Thus the\r\nErsefication of the degenerate Normans became complete; they\r\n\"donned the saffron\"--that is, they adopted the yellow dress of the\r\nCelts--abandoned their original language, and gave themselves up to a\r\nlife of constant plunder and rapine.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fourteenth century the Irish septs united so far as to\r\nform a joint effort to expel the English. The incident is specially\r\ninteresting, in the light of later history. Robert Bruce, a Norman\r\nknight, had recently consolidated the Scottish tribes into a kingdom\r\nand succeeded in shaking off the English yoke. The Irish Celts\r\nresolved to imitate his example. King Robert was shrewd enough to see\r\nthat by aiding them he could attack his enemy at the most vulnerable\r\npoint; consequently, when the chiefs offered the Crown of Ireland to\r\nhis brother Edward if he would come and help them, he gladly accepted\r\nthe invitation. For three years a devastating war raged over a large\r\npart of Ireland; the Scotch went from the North of Ulster almost to\r\nLimerick, burning, slaying, plundering, sacking towns, castles and\r\nchurches; and a terrible famine ensued. But the Irish chiefs were no\r\nmore energetic in supporting Edward Bruce than their ancestors had\r\nbeen in supporting Brian; he and his chief officers fell in a battle\r\nagainst the English near Dundalk, and the rest of his followers\r\nescaped to Scotland. The coalition fell to pieces; and the only result\r\nof the Scotch invasion was to increase the misery of the people,\r\nespecially of the unhappy English settlers, who continued to flock\r\nback to England in greater numbers than before.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the rebellion was put down, the great legislator Edward\r\nIII made another effort at introducing order into the distracted land.\r\nActs were passed by the English Parliament providing that the same\r\nlaw should be applicable to both English and Irish, and forbidding\r\nlandowners to keep larger bands of armed men than were necessary for\r\nself-defence. But the Ersefied barons on whom he relied refused to\r\nobey the new laws; they renounced their allegiance and joined the\r\nrebellious Celtic tribes. Then the king, seeing the impossibility\r\nof carrying out his scheme for pacifying the whole of Ireland, was\r\nreduced to the expedient of dividing the country into two; leaving the\r\nlarger part of it for the natives and degenerate English to misgovern\r\nas they pleased according to their own customs, and preserving only\r\na mere fraction (the \"English Pale\") in allegiance to the Crown of\r\nEngland. This was the real meaning of the \"Statutes of Kilkenny,\"\r\nwhich have been so often misrepresented by modern writers.\r\n\r\nThe next king, Richard II, attempted to imitate the policy of his\r\nancestor Henry II. He went to Ireland with great pomp. Again the\r\nCeltic chiefs flocked to Dublin to swear allegiance to their lord;\r\nand as soon as his back was turned commenced not only fighting amongst\r\nthemselves but even attacking the English Pale. The result of all his\r\nefforts was that the limits of the Pale were still further contracted;\r\nthe English power was confined to a small area in the neighbourhood of\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nBut even within that narrow boundary the power of the king was far\r\nfrom being secure. When England was torn by the Wars of the Roses, the\r\nso-called Parliament (which was really an irregular assembly at best\r\nrepresenting a territory about the size of a modern county) seized\r\nthe opportunity of declaring itself independent. It is interesting, in\r\nview of present-day questions, to observe that Dr. Richey, writing\r\nin 1869, seems to consider their action as not only justifiable but\r\ninevitable. He says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Irish Parliament declared the complete independence\r\n    of the Irish Legislature, and boldly affirmed those\r\n    constitutional rights which, though involved in the existence\r\n    of separate parliament, had not hitherto been categorically\r\n    expressed. They asserted their rights to a distinct coinage,\r\n    and their absolute freedom from all laws and statutes except\r\n    such as were by the Lords spiritual and temporal and Commons\r\n    of Ireland freely admitted and accepted in their Parliament.\r\n    They declared that no Irish subject was bound to answer\r\n    any writs except those under the great seal of Ireland, and\r\n    enacted heavy penalties against any officer who should attempt\r\n    to put English decrees in force in Ireland. They, in fact,\r\n    took the same position and laid down the same principles as\r\n    the celebrated Parliament of 1782.\"\r\n\r\nWhether they imagined that they could form a separate kingdom of\r\nDublin, or dreamt of making an alliance with the tribes outside the\r\nPale, it is useless now to conjecture; but we can see that though they\r\nhad no chance of benefiting themselves they might have caused serious\r\ninjury to England. Nor was it long before a difficulty arose. The\r\ninhabitants of the Pale remained attached to the House of York even\r\nafter the Battle of Bosworth, and readily accepted Lambert Simnel as\r\nKing of Ireland. He was crowned in the Cathedral of Dublin, and held\r\na Parliament. After the defeat of this Pretender, the able and astute\r\nHenry VII saw that it was necessary without further delay to make the\r\nshadowy suzerainty of England over Ireland a reality. He accordingly\r\npersuaded the Irish Parliament to pass an Act which from the name of\r\nthe Lord Deputy was known as \"Poyning's Act.\" By this Act, all English\r\nstatutes then existing in England were made of force in Ireland; the\r\nchief fortresses were secured to the Crown of England; and the Irish\r\nParliament was relegated to the position of a subordinate legislature;\r\nfor it was enacted that no Parliament should be held in Ireland unless\r\nthe King's Lieutenant and Council should first certify the King, under\r\nthe Great Seal of Ireland, the Acts which they considered should pass;\r\nthen the King and his Council should approve the proposed Acts,\r\nand issue a licence under the Great Seal of England, summoning the\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThough some writers have spoken of this as the most disgraceful Act\r\never passed by an independent legislature, the people in Ireland at\r\nthe time considered it a boon and a favour; for it shielded them from\r\nthe unauthorized power of a Lord Deputy supported by a Parliament of\r\nhis own creatures.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with the close of the mediæval period, ended the second\r\nchapter of Irish history. It will be observed that there had been no\r\nreligious persecution, unless indeed the conduct of the Norman--that\r\nis, the Roman--Church towards the ancient Celtic Church, or the\r\nburning of some heretics in the fourteenth century, could be so\r\ndescribed; a view which the Nationalists of to-day will hardly care to\r\nput forward. Nor can the English Government be fairly blamed for the\r\ncondition of affairs; for responsibility depends on power, and English\r\npower in Ireland hardly existed. The suzerainty of England, feeble at\r\nbest, had gradually been limited to a mere fraction of the country.\r\nThe Celtic tribes had long since thrown off even a nominal submission\r\nto the English Crown; the Anglo-Norman lords had become either\r\navowedly or practically independent. But the inhabitants of Ireland\r\ndid not constitute a nation or possess any common interest or bond of\r\nunion. There was no trace of an organization by which the Irish tribes\r\ncould be united into one people. The ceaseless civil wars had indeed\r\nsupplanted the original tribesmen by the mercenary followers of\r\nanother set of rival chiefs; but there had been no union; and the mass\r\nof the people, still under the influence of their native customs, were\r\nprobably in a more wretched condition than they had ever been before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIRELAND UNDER THE TUDORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that at the close of the Middle Ages Ireland was in the\r\ncondition that some people in England now consider the panacea for\r\nall the woes of the country; it possessed a subordinate Parliament and\r\nEngland interfered as little as possible in its local affairs. Henry\r\nVIII attempted \"to govern Ireland according to Irish ideas\"; having no\r\narmy of his own, he appointed the most powerful of the Norman barons\r\nhis deputy. But this deputy used his authority precisely as an\r\nErsefied Norman (who possessed no more patriotism or national feeling\r\nthan a Celtic chief) might have been expected to use it,--that was, to\r\naid him in a succession of family quarrels and tribal wars in which,\r\nallied with some of the native septs he attacked others. Even the\r\ntowns outside the Pale fared little better than the remoter districts;\r\nthere was actually a civil war between Cork and Limerick. The state of\r\naffairs in Celtic Ireland during the brief period from 1500 to 1534\r\nas stated in the annals (which, however, only deal with a part of the\r\ncountry, hardly referring to what took place in Leinster or Munster)\r\nhas been summed up by Dr. Richey in the following words:--\r\n\r\n    \"Battles, plunderings, etc., exclusive of those in which the\r\n    English Government was engaged, 116; Irish gentlemen of\r\n    family killed in battle, 102; murdered, 168--many of them with\r\n    circumstances of great atrocity; and during this period, on\r\n    the other hand, there is no allusion to the enactment of any\r\n    law, the judicial decision of any controversy, the founding of\r\n    any town, monastery or church; and all this is recorded by\r\n    the annalist without the slightest expression of regret or\r\n    astonishment, as if such were the ordinary course of life in a\r\n    Christian country.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1534, matters came to a head; the Lord Deputy broke out\r\ninto open rebellion. We can learn from the State papers of the period\r\nwhat the condition of Ireland then was. The Pale--now but the remnant\r\nof a fraction--was constantly invaded and ravished by wild tribes,\r\nand was itself becoming Ersefied; for the poorer English settlers had\r\neither fled back to England, joined the Celtic tribes in despair, as\r\ntheir only way of escaping from the harshness of the English lords, or\r\nbeen crushed out of existence; and, as had already happened elsewhere,\r\ntheir place had been taken by Irish retainers. Then in the rest of the\r\ncountry there were some ninety chiefs, of whom about sixty represented\r\nancient septs and the remainder degenerate Normans, all claiming\r\nindependence and preying sometimes on one another and sometimes on\r\ntheir unfortunate followers. Not infrequently also a tribe was divided\r\nagainst itself, and a civil war was raging between the two factions.\r\nAnd one result of the Ersefication of the Norman barons was that,\r\nin addition to the regular feudal dues, they demanded every kind\r\nof Celtic tribute from the occupiers of the land. In fact, how the\r\nwretched tenants managed to support life at all seems a mystery.\r\nWhatever law there may at one time have been was now long extinct;\r\nand as King Henry himself pointed out, if the natives were to have any\r\nsort of law at all, the only possible law was the law of England.\r\n\r\nAt this time also a new factor came into the already complicated\r\nproblem--the Reformation. Henry VIII never was a Protestant, in\r\nthe sense of adopting the doctrines which are now usually called\r\nProtestant; but he had renounced the authority of the Pope. In 1535\r\nPope Paul III passed sentence upon him, consigning his kingdoms to\r\nwhoever might invade them, and commanding his nobles to take up\r\narms against him. Both the Emperor and the King of France saw their\r\nopportunity, as Robert Bruce had done centuries before. They commenced\r\na correspondence with the Irish chiefs with the object of bringing\r\nabout an invasion of Ireland. Thereupon King Henry resolved to take\r\nthe only course that seemed to him possible--to make the conquest\r\nof Ireland a reality and to enforce law and order in that distracted\r\nland. His letters, which are still extant, show the care with which he\r\nthought out the matter, and his earnest desire for the welfare of\r\nthe people of both races; a perusal of them would astonish those who\r\nregard him merely as a savage sensualist. Strange to say, in their\r\nIrish policy, the character of Henry VIII shows itself at the best,\r\nand that of Elizabeth at its worst. When Henry had with difficulty\r\nsucceeded in crushing the Geraldine rebellion and a series of others\r\nwhich broke out soon after, he got the Irish Parliament to pass an\r\nAct conferring on him the title of king; he was solemnly proclaimed as\r\nsuch, and his title was confirmed by the almost unanimous consent of\r\nthe Irish princes.\r\n\r\nThis was important in more ways than one: it was universally\r\nrecognized that the word \"king\" meant much more than \"lord\"; and it\r\ngave him a title independent of the Pope's donation.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the ironies of history that the renunciation of the Papal\r\nauthority and the submission to the king's supremacy was far more\r\nrapid and general in Ireland than it was in England. For not only did\r\nall the lay chiefs readily yield their adhesion, but only two of the\r\nbishops refused to take the oath of supremacy. Rebellions such as that\r\nof Fitzgerald had no connection with religion; it was not until years\r\nafterwards when England had become identified with Protestantism and\r\nSpain with Catholicism that the Irish became intensely Papal. On the\r\nother hand, the Reformation, as a religious movement, made no headway\r\nin Ireland. It was purely negative and destructive, and emanated from\r\nthe Government, not from the mass of the people. The monasteries were\r\ndestroyed; hence there were no vicars to supply the parish churches,\r\nwhich fell into ruin; the king endeavoured rather to Anglify than to\r\nProtestantise the people by sending to them bishops and clergy from\r\nEngland--but they were mere state officials, not fathers in God;\r\nunable even to speak the Irish language; what real preaching there\r\nwas was done by friars sent from Rome and Madrid. Henry's efforts at\r\nestablishing parish schools were also a total failure. Had there not\r\nbeen later immigrations from England and Scotland, Irish Protestantism\r\nwould probably have died out. Yet it is but fair to state, and to bear\r\nin mind, that there was no religious persecution as such in Ireland\r\nduring the Tudor period. Elizabeth's policy was, without making any\r\nactual promise of freedom of conscience, to leave the question of\r\nreligious opinions alone as far as possible. The real difficulty came\r\nfrom the political nature of the Church of Rome; when the Pope deposed\r\nElizabeth and gave Ireland to Philip of Spain every Irish Roman\r\nCatholic had either to be false to his religion or to become a\r\ntraitor--_in esse_ or _in posse_--to the queen.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry had resolved to do his utmost to bring Ireland to a state\r\nof civilization, there were not wanting advisers who urged upon him\r\nthat his only safe course was absolutely to destroy the whole native\r\npopulation by sword and famine and re-people the vacant lands by\r\nimmigrants from England. Such a course would have been quite in\r\naccordance with the ideas of the time. Not thirty years previously,\r\nthe combined forces of Church and State had pursued the heretic\r\npopulation of the Loise into the mountain fastnesses to which they had\r\nfled, and had piled logs of wood at the mouths of the caves in which\r\nthey had taken refuge, and set them on fire. Then, when all the\r\nunhappy people--men, women and children, numbering some thousands\r\nin all--had perished, their lands were distributed amongst strangers\r\nbrought in from a distance to occupy them. And at a later date--in the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century--the native inhabitants of the Canary\r\nIslands were exterminated by the Spanish Inquisition, and their lands\r\ntaken by the invading race. But to Henry it appeared that there was\r\none milder course that might still be possible. Might not the native\r\nchiefs and the degenerate Normans who had shown that their only idea\r\nof independency was anarchy yet be brought together as nobles under\r\na strong central government with a Parliament representing not merely\r\nthe Pale, but all Ireland? Might not the mass of the people, whose\r\nnative customs had been well nigh crushed out by civil wars,\r\nbe persuaded to _adopt_ the law of England? This was the policy\r\ndeliberately adopted by Henry and acted on by him during his life.\r\nIt is easy for writers living in modern times to sneer at some of the\r\ndetails of his scheme; but it is not so easy for them to point out\r\nwhat other course would have been better; or indeed, whether any other\r\ncourse short of a policy of extermination, would have been possible.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable thing, however, is that the change to a more severe\r\nline took place not under Henry or his Protestant son, but under the\r\nmost Catholic Sovereigns Philip and Mary. It was by their orders that\r\nthe first of the confiscations (which were to play so important a part\r\nin the later history of Ireland) was carried out. By an Act passed\r\nin their reign the lands occupied by the O'Moores, O'Connors and\r\nO'Dempseys were confiscated and formed into the King's and\r\nQueen's counties, Leix and Offaly being renamed \"Philipstown\" and\r\n\"Maryborough\"; and a \"Plantation\" of English settlers was established.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is well to pause for a moment and consider these\r\nconfiscations, about which so much has been written. That\r\nconfiscations have taken place in every country is a plain fact of\r\nhistory. There is probably no part of Western Europe where land is\r\nnow held by the descendants of the aboriginal inhabitants. Forcible\r\nconquest and adverse occupation is nearly always the primary root\r\nof title. But it is part of the policy of every civilized country to\r\nrecognize what lawyers call \"Statutes of limitations.\" When centuries\r\nhave elapsed and new rights have grown up, it is impossible to rectify\r\nthe wrongs of times long gone by. Thus we cannot suppose that any\r\nfuture Government of Spain would ever recognize the title of the Moors\r\nin Africa to the properties from which their ancestors were driven\r\nby Philip IV; or that the Huguenots, now scattered over various\r\ncountries, could ever succeed in recovering possession of the estates\r\nin France which were confiscated at the time of the Revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes. And the only people who have a cause to complain,\r\neven on sentimental grounds, of the wrongs of past ages, are the\r\nlineal descendants of those who suffered ill-treatment. No Englishman\r\nto-day can feel aggrieved because Saxons drove out Britons, or Normans\r\nSaxons.\r\n\r\nBut more than that: the confiscation of the lands of rebels stands on\r\na different basis, and has been so regarded in every country in the\r\nworld, even New Zealand. The lands confiscated by Philip and Mary were\r\nowned by the arch-rebel FitzGerald. Naturally fertile and capable if\r\nproperly cultivated of supporting a large population, they were at\r\nthis time a wild pathless tract of forest and bog. The ceaseless\r\ntribal wars had prevented their being drained and cleared; the\r\nmiserable remnants of the Celtic tribes gained a precarious living by\r\nperiodical raids on the more peaceful inhabitants of the Pale. During\r\nthe whole of the reign of Edward VI fighting had gone on in Leix and\r\nOffaly with great loss of life and at enormous expense to the English\r\nGovernment. The object of the confiscation was not to drive out the\r\nfew existing tribesmen; for the land, when cleared and drained, might\r\nwell support them as well as the new settlers. Nor was it to confer\r\ngreat estates on absentee proprietors, but to establish a fairly\r\nthickly settled district which might be a source of strength rather\r\nthan a constant cause of trouble to the dwellers in the Pale. Nor\r\nagain was it to introduce feudalism; for as I have shown, the system\r\nalready in existence was feudalism without its advantages; the\r\nsubstitution of fixed dues for the barbarous custom of \"coigne and\r\nlivery\" was an unmixed benefit to the occupiers of land. And it cannot\r\nbe denied that the first \"Plantation\" was a thorough success--thriving\r\nsettlements and prosperous farms took the place of forest and swamp.\r\n\r\nIf the position of Henry VIII had been one of difficulty, that of\r\nElizabeth was far more critical. The separation of the Church of\r\nEngland from Rome was now complete. The great powers of the Continent\r\nwere united in one supreme effort to stamp out the new heresy. The\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew had taken place in France; Philip II had\r\nordered a _Te Deum_ to be sung at Madrid, and the Pope had had a medal\r\nstruck to commemorate the glorious event. The lowest computation of\r\nthose put to death for heresy in the Netherlands by Charles V was\r\n50,000; and his successor had, at the instigation of the Holy Office,\r\nissued a proclamation sentencing to death the whole population--men,\r\nwomen and children--with the exception of a few persons specially\r\nnamed. Alva boasted that he had put 18,000 Dutchmen to death on the\r\nscaffold, and the Pope presented him with a consecrated hat and\r\nsword, an honour which had previously been bestowed only on reigning\r\nsovereigns. In Spain it was regarded not only as a sacred duty but a\r\npleasant amusement for the King and his Court to watch the\r\ntorturing of heretics. England alone--then a comparatively weak\r\nand insignificant country--stood out against this overwhelming\r\ncombination. And in attempting to realize the position of affairs we\r\nmust remember that in the sixteenth century the Papacy was not merely\r\na religious system but also a tremendous political power. We may now\r\nregard the claim of the Pope to depose princes as a harmless dream;\r\nbut at that time it was a stern reality. Thus matters came to a crisis\r\nwhen the Pope excommunicated Elizabeth and all who remained loyal\r\nto her, released her subjects from their allegiance, offered plenary\r\nindulgence and remission of sins to all who would take up arms against\r\nher, promised a liberal supply of graces and indulgences to Irish\r\nchieftains who would rebel, and gave Ireland to Philip of Spain.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be denied therefore that England was engaged in a\r\nlife and death struggle. And unless Elizabeth would consent to the\r\nannexation of Ireland by Spain and to the conquest of England by some\r\npower that would treat the people there much as the heretics of the\r\nNetherlands were being treated by Philip, it must be admitted that any\r\nmeasures, however violent, became a political necessity--a mere act\r\nof self-defence. But though Elizabeth had already on hand a war with\r\nFrance, Spain and Scotland, her difficulties did not end there. The\r\nNorth of Ireland was being invaded by Celts from Scotland, and the\r\nprincipal chief, Shan O'Neill (who was described by the Spanish\r\nAmbassador as \"so good a Christian that he cuts off the head of any\r\nman who enters his country if he be not a Catholic\") was in open\r\nrebellion with the avowed object of crushing out the English power,\r\nexterminating the rival tribes, and making himself King of Ulster. To\r\nso miserable a state had that part of Ireland been reduced by petty\r\nlocal wars between rival chiefs that hundreds of people had died\r\nof hunger. Can it be wondered that Elizabeth conceived the idea of\r\nimitating her sister's policy and forming a \"plantation\" in the North?\r\n\r\nThen came another formidable rebellion in Munster, headed by an\r\nErsefied Norman, Desmond. These rebellions were fomented by the Pope,\r\nand in the South the rebels were aided by Spanish troops. In the\r\namount of the aid sent from Spain, however, the Irish rebels were\r\nsadly disappointed. That has been one of the characteristic features\r\nof all Irish rebellions; the foreign powers on which they have relied\r\nhave been liberal enough with promises of aid, but when the time for\r\nperformance has come they have left the unfortunate Irish to their\r\nfate. (Thus in 1641 not only did the rebels fully expect that a\r\npowerful Spanish force would come to their assistance, but they even\r\nbelieved that 18,000 Spanish troops had actually landed at Wexford.)\r\nThat these rebellions were crushed by the forces of Queen Elizabeth\r\nwith a savage violence that is more suggestive of the government of\r\nthe Netherlands by Spain than of what should have been the action of\r\na Christian nation cannot be denied; but when reading the accounts\r\nof the terrible condition to which the country was reduced one cannot\r\nhelp thinking that the stories of outrages committed by the English\r\ntroops must be exaggerated. In the first place, the writers, even when\r\neye-witnesses, seem to have assumed that the country was peaceful and\r\nprosperous up to that time; whereas not only had the tribal wars which\r\nhad gone on incessantly until a few years before reduced the people\r\nalmost to a condition of famine, but the rebels themselves, such\r\nas O'Neill and Desmond, had ravaged the country anew. And if it was\r\nobvious that the object of Elizabeth was to exterminate the whole\r\nIrish population and the Roman Catholic religion, it seems impossible\r\n(even allowing for the eccentricity of human nature in general and of\r\nthe Irish character in particular) to believe that a large part of the\r\nqueen's forces should have been composed of Irish Roman Catholics; or\r\nthat the inhabitants of the towns, most of whom were also Irish Roman\r\nCatholics, should have taken her side; but such was undoubtedly\r\nthe case. Again, if nearly the whole native population had been\r\nexterminated by slaughter and famine it would have taken at least a\r\ncentury to recover. Yet--a few years after the commencement of\r\nthe English settlement we find Spenser complaining that the new\r\nproprietors were acting as the Norman barons had done centuries\r\nbefore; instead of keeping out the Irish they were making them their\r\ntenants and thrusting out the English; and some of the proprietors\r\nwere themselves becoming \"mere Irish.\" Then, although no doubt\r\na certain proportion of the Elizabethan settlers renounced their\r\nProtestantism and embraced the Roman Catholic religion, that can\r\nhardly have been the case with the mass of them; and yet before the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century we find that the great majority\r\nof the freeholders of Ireland and even of the members of the Irish\r\nParliament were Roman Catholics; surely they must have represented\r\nthe earlier population. And lastly, considering the wild exaggerations\r\nthat occur in the accounts of every other event of Irish history, we\r\ncannot suppose that this period alone has escaped.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the queen's reign occurred the last of the\r\nnative rebellions. It too was crushed; and, by the \"flight of the\r\nearls\"--Tyrone and Tyrconnell--was completed the work which had been\r\ncommenced by Henry II. And so the third chapter of Irish history was\r\nended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY, UNTIL THE END OF THE REIGN OF JAMES II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century is a terrible period of European history. It\r\nhas been described as \"the age of religious wars\"; and those wars were\r\nwaged with a savage ferocity which it is impossible even now to read\r\nof without a shudder.\r\n\r\nIt is a plain matter of history that from the very commencement of the\r\nReformation the idea of toleration never entered into the heads of\r\nany of the authorities of the Church of Rome. France, Spain, Portugal,\r\nSavoy and Germany all tell the same story. Except in countries such as\r\nEngland where the sovereigns adopted the new opinions, the only chance\r\nwhich the reforming party had of being able to exercise their religion\r\nwas by means of rebellion and all the horrors of civil war. What that\r\nmeant, the history of the rise of the Dutch Republic tells us. As Lord\r\nActon has said: \"In the seventeenth century the murder of a heretic\r\nwas not only permitted but rewarded. It was a virtuous deed to\r\nslaughter Protestant men and women until they were all exterminated.\r\nPius V held that it was sound Catholic doctrine that any man may\r\nstab a heretic; and every man was a heretic who attacked the papal\r\nprerogatives.\" And it is equally true that in those cases where the\r\nreforming party succeeded in gaining the upper hand, they did not show\r\nmuch more mercy than had been shown to them previously or was being\r\nshown to their co-religionists in other countries at the time. Yet\r\nit is only fair to add that when the idea of toleration did arise, it\r\narose amongst the reformed churches. Probably the only Roman Catholic\r\nState in the world where toleration existed during the seventeenth\r\ncentury was the little English colony of Maryland, of which Lord\r\nBaltimore was the proprietor. And when at length the religious wars\r\ndied out it was, as far as Catholic countries were concerned, because\r\nthe lay mind had become thoroughly disgusted with the whole thing, and\r\nmen's minds were turning in other directions--not because the clerical\r\nrulers showed the slightest desire to relax their efforts or change\r\ntheir policy.\r\n\r\nIt would be well if the whole dreadful period could be buried in\r\noblivion. But it is necessary to mention the subject here, for the\r\nNationalist party are continually referring to the horrors of the\r\nCromwellian massacres and the penal laws; and if such matters are to\r\nbe gone into at all it is only fair, in order to make a just estimate\r\nof them, to glance at the great European struggle of which they formed\r\nan incident. In the century which saw Germany deluged with blood\r\nfor thirty years, and which witnessed the revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes and the revival of vehement persecution in France, it was not\r\nlikely that Ireland should remain unaffected.\r\n\r\nSoon after James I came to the throne he commenced his famous Scotch\r\nplantation in the desolated and half-emptied province of Ulster. That\r\nit was even a greater success than the plantation formed by Philip\r\nand Mary everyone is of course aware; it is the descendants of those\r\nimmigrants who, though they live in a district not so highly favoured\r\nby nature as other parts of the country, form the only really\r\nprosperous and progressive section of the community at the present\r\nday. The native Irish do not seem to have looked on the Scotchmen with\r\nmuch disfavour, perhaps partly because there being plenty of room for\r\nall in the desolated tract, and lands being assigned to them, they\r\nrealised that they were safer in the immediate neighbourhood of a\r\npeaceful settlement than they would have been had they remained a prey\r\nto unscrupulous adventurers like Shan O'Neill. A member of the legal\r\nprofession must feel shame and sorrow in recording the fact that\r\nthe chicanery of the lawyers added much to the harshness of the\r\npoliticians. That, however, is only another way of saying that\r\nthe humane policy of the nineteenth century was unknown in the\r\nseventeenth. Had courts been established in Ireland like the native\r\nland courts of New Zealand in which claims under customary law might\r\nbe investigated, and equitable awards made, the later history of\r\nIreland might have been very different. Yet one must remember that\r\neven in the reign of Queen Victoria there was a strong party in\r\nEngland and there were not a few people in New Zealand who argued\r\nthat Maori customary claims should be disregarded and the treaty\r\nof Waitangi ignored. And in the seventeenth century such ideas were\r\nunheard of. Lawyers searched for every technicality of English law\r\nby which the titles of holders of land could be upset, in favour of\r\nEnglish claimants. Then matters became strangely complicated, as they\r\nseem to be periodically throughout Irish history. The struggle between\r\nCharles I and the Parliament began, and it soon became evident that\r\nthe Parliamentary party was the stronger of the two. To the Irish the\r\nParliamentarians meant the Puritans; and they believed, not wholly\r\nwithout reason, that a determined attempt would be made not only to\r\nseize all their lands but also to stamp out their religion. (It\r\nmust be observed that the Elizabethan anti-Roman Acts had never been\r\nstrictly carried out in Ireland, and during the reign of James I their\r\nseverity had been relaxed still further--a line of conduct which had\r\nno parallel in any Roman Catholic country in Europe at the time.)\r\nThereupon in 1641 the Roman Catholics of Ulster broke into open\r\nrebellion, and soon afterwards they applied to the kings of France and\r\nSpain for aid; and the Pope issued a bull granting a full and plenary\r\nindulgence and absolute remission for all their sins to all who would\r\ndo their utmost to extirpate and totally root out those workers of\r\niniquity who in the kingdom of Ireland had infected and were always\r\nstriving to infect the mass of Catholic purity with the pestiferous\r\nleaven of their heretical contagion.\r\n\r\nThe stories told of the actual outbreak of the rebellion are\r\ninteresting as an illustration of the universal habit of exaggeration\r\nabout Irish affairs, to which I have already alluded. Clarendon\r\naffirms that 40,000 English Protestants were murdered before they\r\nsuspected themselves to be in any danger; Temple states that in\r\nthe first two months of the rebellion 150,000 Protestants had been\r\nmassacred. The Jesuit, O'Mahony, writing in 1645, says \"Persevere,\r\nmy countrymen, in the path you have entered on, and exterminate your\r\nheretical opponents, their adherents and helpers. Already within four\r\nor five years you have killed 150,000 of them, as you do not deny. I\r\nmyself believe that even a greater number of the heretics have been\r\ncut off; would that I could say all.\" He had doubtless obtained\r\nhis information from the returns made by the priests engaged in the\r\nrebellion to the military leaders, the figures of which were much the\r\nsame. Yet Lecky (who, though in certain passages of his history he\r\nshows himself to be somewhat biassed in favour of the Irish Roman\r\nCatholic party, is on the whole a remarkably fair and impartial\r\nhistorian) argues with much force that there is no evidence of\r\nanything like a general massacre, and brings down the number murdered\r\nto about 8,000. Still, that there was a widespread rebellion and all\r\nthe consequent horrors of civil war, there can be no doubt. The rebels\r\nof Ulster at one time tried to identify their cause with that of\r\nCharles I by producing a forged commission from the king--which\r\nannoyed the Royalists and made the Parliamentary party all the more\r\nbitter. Charles certainly did his utmost to bring about a peace--no\r\ndoubt being anxious to obtain the assistance of his Irish subjects\r\nin his Scotch and English wars. But his efforts were thwarted by the\r\nPapal Nuncio, whose instructions from Rome were that the Holy See\r\ncould never by any positive Act approve of the civil allegiance of\r\nCatholic subjects to an heretical prince; and thus the Royalist cause\r\nbecame as completely lost in Ireland as it was in England. Before the\r\npeace was finally concluded, Charles was a prisoner in the hands of\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\nThen came the terrible episode of the Cromwellian war, in which\r\nRomanist and Royalist alike went down before the Puritan force. Still,\r\nthough he would be a bold man who could attempt to excuse--much less\r\nto justify--the barbarities that took place, it may be doubted whether\r\nall the Cromwellian outrages put together equalled a single one of\r\nthose which the Imperial troops had committed during the war which\r\nhad been raging for thirty years in Germany--such for instance as the\r\nsacking of Magdeburg. It is estimated, however, that about 600,000\r\npeople (of whom 500,000 were of the Irish race and 100,000 of the\r\nEnglish) perished by the sword, pestilence or famine in the fearful\r\nyears between 1641 and 1652--in other words, about a third part of\r\nthe population was wiped out. And the war was followed by a wholesale\r\nconfiscation--having fought for the king being considered as much an\r\nact of treason as having rebelled against him. The confiscated lands\r\nwere allotted to soldiers, to persons who had supplied money to the\r\nParliamentary forces, and to other supporters of the new Government.\r\nIt is but just, however, to add that 700,000 acres of profitable land\r\nin Connaught were allotted to dispossessed Romanists, and that they\r\nwere allowed to occupy 100,000 acres in other parts of the country; a\r\nstriking contrast to the lot of the unhappy Waldenses who were at that\r\ntime being driven from their homes and slaughtered without mercy for\r\nno crime but heresy; or to the treatment a few years later by Louis\r\nXIV of his Huguenot subjects whose lands were confiscated without\r\ncompensation and who were only given the choice of death or the\r\ngalleys.\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration some effort was made to undo the injustice of the\r\nCromwellian confiscations. But the matter was one of great difficulty.\r\nIn many cases land had been allotted by Cromwell in payment for money\r\nreceived; in others the grantees had sold their holdings to purchasers\r\nwho had paid in cash, regarding the original grant as indefeasible.\r\nA reconfiscation of such lands would obviously have worked a great\r\ninjustice; and it is a common maxim of law that between two claimants\r\neach with a good title the one in possession is to be preferred. Still\r\nit cannot be said that the decisions of the Royal Commissioners were\r\nalways equitable according to our ideas; for instance, the award of\r\n80,000 acres to the Duke of York (afterwards James II) of land which\r\nhad been forfeited under Cromwell because the owner had fought for his\r\nfather, would be hard to justify on any possible grounds. Still, an\r\nAct of Settlement was passed, by which a certain amount of justice\r\nwas done; it is difficult to arrive at the figures accurately, but\r\nit appears that after the passing of the Act nearly one-third of\r\nthe Island was vested in Roman Catholic proprietors. Archbishop King\r\nestimated that at the time when he was writing--1689--two-thirds\r\nof the Protestant landowners held their estates under the Act of\r\nSettlement. And Lecky says, \"Only an infinitesimal portion of the soil\r\nbelongs to the descendants of those who possessed it before Cromwell.\"\r\nBut Archbishop King was influenced by the fear he had felt as to what\r\nthe effect of a repeal of the Act would be; and there can hardly be\r\na doubt that his feelings led him to overestimate the number. With\r\nregard to Lecky's remark, one can only take it as a strange instance\r\nof a gross exaggeration having crept into a book which is usually\r\ncareful and accurate. It may be that the statement was not very\r\nincorrect according to the evidence the author had before him; but if\r\nso, that only proves that the evidence was wrong; for the proceedings\r\nin the Land Courts which have been set up in Ireland during the last\r\nhalf century have shown that the proportion of titles to estates which\r\ndate from an earlier period was far larger than people had supposed.\r\n\r\nDuring the peaceful and tolerant reign of Charles II the country made\r\nsteady progress.\r\n\r\nUnder James II, however, everything was reversed. That unhappy\r\nmonarch, having ascended the throne tranquilly, with many\r\nprotestations of toleration and justice to all, succeeded in less than\r\ntwo years in making it clear to the people of England that his object\r\nwas to confine liberty to those who professed his own creed and that\r\nhis idea of good government was something like that which was then\r\nexisting in France and Savoy. Driven from Great Britain, on his\r\narrival in Ireland he issued a proclamation declaring that his\r\nProtestant subjects, their religion, privileges and properties were\r\nhis especial care; and he had previously directed the Lord Lieutenant\r\nto declare in Council that he would preserve the Act of Settlement\r\ninviolable. But the Protestants soon had reason to fear that his\r\npromises were illusory and that the liberty which might be allowed to\r\nthem would be at best temporary. In a word, what the one party looked\r\nforward to with hope and the other with dread was \"a confederacy with\r\nFrance which would make His Majesty's monarchy absolute.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to understand what that meant, to Irish Protestants, it is\r\nwell to glance at the condition of France at the time. Louis XIV had\r\nbegun by directing that the Edict of Nantes was to be interpreted by\r\nthe strictest letter of the law; and soon after that the condition\r\nof the Huguenots became more unhappy than that of the Irish Roman\r\nCatholics ever was during the penal laws. The terrible \"Dragonnades\"\r\ncommenced in 1682; soldiers were billeted on heretics, and unfortunate\r\nwomen were insulted past endurance; Huguenots were restricted even\r\nas to holding family prayers; children at the age of seven were\r\nencouraged to renounce their faith, and if they did so they were\r\ntaken from their parents who, however, were obliged to pay for their\r\nmaintenance in convent schools. Protestant churches were closed, and\r\ntheir endowments handed over to Roman Catholic institutions. Huguenot\r\nchildren were forbidden all education except the most elementary. No\r\nheretic was allowed to sue a Catholic for debt. All this, however, did\r\nnot satisfy the monarch or his ecclesiastical advisers. On the 18th\r\nof October 1685, he issued his famous Revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes:--\r\n\r\n    \"We by the present Edict which is perpetual and irrevocable,\r\n    revoke the Edict given at Nantes in 1583 together with every\r\n    concession to the Protestants of whatever nature they be.\r\n    We will that all temples of that religion be instantly\r\n    demolished. We prohibit our Protestant subjects to assemble\r\n    for worship in any private house. We prohibit all our lords\r\n    to exercise that religion within their fiefs under penalty of\r\n    confiscation of property and imprisonment of person. We enjoin\r\n    all ministers of the said faith to leave the kingdom within\r\n    fifteen days of the publication of this Edict, under penalty\r\n    of the galleys. We enjoin that all children who shall be\r\n    born henceforth be baptized by the Catholic curates. Persons\r\n    awaiting the enlightening grace of God may live in our kingdom\r\n    unhindered on account of their religion on condition that they\r\n    do not perform any of its exercises or assemble for prayer or\r\n    worship under penalty of body and wealth.\"\r\n\r\nThis Edict met with cordial approval from the Catholic party in\r\nFrance. The famous Madame de Sevigné wrote: \"I admire the king for the\r\nmeans he has devised for ruining the Huguenots. The wars and massacres\r\nof former days only gave vigour to the sect; but the edict just\r\nissued, aided by the dragoons, will give them the _coup de grace_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish Protestants saw with alarm that amongst the soldiers who\r\ncame from France to aid King James were some who had taken an active\r\npart in the dragonnades organized by Louis XIV in order to carry out\r\nhis edict. Then one Act was passed by the Dublin Parliament repealing\r\nthe Act of Settlement; and by another 2,461 persons were declared\r\nguilty of high treason unless they appeared before the Dublin\r\nauthorities on a certain day and proved they were not guilty. What\r\nsteps King James was prepared to take in order to subdue the rebels of\r\nDerry who held out against him can be gathered from the proclamation\r\nwhich he directed Conrade de Rosen, his Mareschal General, to issue.\r\nHe warned the rebels that if they did not surrender immediately, all\r\nthe members of their faction, whether protected or not, in the whole\r\nneighbourhood, would be brought close to the walls of the city and\r\nthere starved to death; that he would ravish the countryside, and see\r\nthat no man, woman or child escaped; and that if the city still held\r\nout he would give no quarter and spare neither age nor sex, in case it\r\nwas taken by force.\r\n\r\nEven if there had been no Derry to relieve and no Protestants in\r\nother parts of the country, the conquest of Ireland was a political\r\nnecessity to King William. England was at this time in much the same\r\nposition that it had been in the days of Elizabeth, substituting the\r\nname France for Spain. The continental powers were again united in a\r\nsupreme effort to stamp out Protestantism, and England once more\r\nstood almost alone. In Spain and Portugal, heresy was of course still\r\npunishable with death; the Pope had celebrated the Revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes with a triumphal _Te Deum_; a terrible persecution was\r\nraging not only throughout the Protestant districts of France but also\r\non the Rhine, in Hungary, Savoy and the Alpine Valleys; if Ireland\r\nhad remained a separate kingdom ruled by the ally and admirer of Louis\r\nXIV, the next step would certainly have been an invasion of England\r\nby the joint forces of France and Ireland. All that we in modern\r\ntimes include in the term \"religious liberty\" hung on the issue of the\r\nbattle that was fought and won on the banks of the Boyne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF THE PENAL LAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flight of James II brings us to the era of the \"penal laws.\" To\r\none who lives in the twentieth century and is embued with the spirit\r\nof modern thought, the whole subject is more than painful--it is\r\ndetestable. But to pass it over in silence is impossible; and in order\r\nto get a clear view of the position it is necessary to examine\r\nwhat the penal laws were, what they were not, and what were the\r\ncircumstances of the time during which they were in force.\r\n\r\nThe penal laws were a series of enactments carefully planned so as to\r\nharass the Roman Catholics at every moment of their lives, in the hope\r\nof inducing them to abandon their religion. The unhappy people were\r\nprohibited from becoming or voting for members of Parliament; they\r\nwere excluded from corporations, the army, the navy and the legal\r\nprofession. They were forbidden to bear arms, or even to possess a\r\nhorse worth more than £5. Education was denied to them, as they could\r\nnot send their sons to the university and were forbidden either to\r\nhave schools of their own in Ireland or to send their children abroad.\r\nThey were not allowed to possess freehold estates in land, and even as\r\nto leaseholds they were seriously restricted. On the death of a Roman\r\nCatholic his estate was divided amongst his children equally, unless\r\nthe eldest son became a Protestant, in which case he inherited the\r\nwhole. And as no Roman Catholic was allowed to act as a guardian, a\r\nman never knew that if he should die his children might not be brought\r\nup in a faith that he detested. The performance of Roman Catholic\r\nworship was barely tolerated, as no bishops or other dignitaries were\r\nallowed to remain in Ireland, and the only priests authorized to\r\nsay mass were those who were \"registered\" and had taken the oath of\r\nabjuration--that is, an oath declaring that the Pretender had no right\r\nto the throne.\r\n\r\nSuch in brief were those terrible statutes. But without attempting\r\nto excuse them, there are various matters which must be taken into\r\naccount if we are to judge them fairly. In the first place, the\r\npolitical aspect of the question should not be forgotten. The\r\nProtestant minority might justly fear that if the Roman Catholic party\r\nwere as powerful as their numbers would naturally cause them to be,\r\nthey would aid in bringing about a French invasion for the restoration\r\nof the Stuarts and the re-establishment of the system which had been\r\nin evidence under James II. An army was actually formed in France, and\r\non more than one occasion was in readiness to start. The Stuarts were\r\nregarded by the Pope as the rightful sovereigns. The Roman Catholic\r\nprelates whose entry into Ireland was forbidden were appointed by\r\nthe Pretender and were his political agents; it was that fact, and no\r\ndoctrinal reason, that caused their expulsion. It is necessary to make\r\nthis quite clear, as there has been as much exaggeration on this point\r\nas on most other subjects connected with Irish history. The words of\r\nthe \"oath of abjuration\" were as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"I do solemnly and sincerely declare that I do believe in my\r\n    conscience that the person pretended to be Prince of Wales\r\n    during the life of the late King James and since his decease\r\n    taking upon himself the style and title of King of England by\r\n    the name of James III hath not any right or title whatever to\r\n    the crown of this realm.\"\r\n\r\nA modern Roman Catholic writer has thus described the oath:--\r\n\r\n    \"By the Oath of Abjuration the priest was ordered to swear\r\n    that the sacrifice of the mass and the invocation of the\r\n    Blessed Virgin and the saints were damnable and idolatrous. In\r\n    other words, the priest was ordered to apostatize, or fly for\r\n    his life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd even if Roman Catholics took the oath of allegiance, the old\r\ndifficulty arose as to the papal right to depose princes and to order\r\ntheir subjects to rebel. So late as 1768, when a declaration was drawn\r\nup which it was hoped the leaders of the Roman Catholic party would\r\nsign, so that the penal laws might be finally done away with, the\r\nPapal Nuncio vetoed the proposal because the declaration contained a\r\nreprobation of the doctrines that faith need not be kept with heretics\r\nand that if the Pope banned a sovereign his subjects might depose and\r\nslay him. It is but fair to add, however, that a large number of Roman\r\nCatholics did sign the declaration; and the penal laws (which had been\r\nrelaxed from time to time when it was seen that the Irish took no\r\npart in the Stuart rebellions of 1715 and 1745) were soon afterwards\r\npractically abolished.\r\n\r\nThen it must be borne in mind that the Irish penal laws, although\r\nto some extent modelled on the legislation of Louis XIV against the\r\nHuguenots, were absolutely insignificant compared with those which\r\nwere in force at the time in every Roman Catholic country in Europe.\r\nGalling though the Irish laws were, they never went so far as to\r\nmake the mere holding of heretical opinions criminal. Thus no one in\r\nIreland was ever put to death for believing in transubstantiation;\r\nwhereas in one diocese of Portugal 20,000 people were sent to the\r\nstake for denying it. As every one who has visited the Madrid picture\r\ngallery will recollect, it was still the custom in the eighteenth\r\ncentury for the King of Spain to preside in state at the burning of\r\nheretics; and it was not until that century was drawing to a close\r\nthat it was for the first time enacted in Portugal that sentence of\r\ndeath for heresy when passed by the ecclesiastical court should not be\r\ncarried into effect unless the order was countersigned by the king. In\r\nFrance, for two or three heretics to meet for worship anywhere (their\r\nchurches had of course all been pulled down) was a crime punishable\r\nwith death; and any Huguenot caught whilst attempting to escape from\r\nthe country was sent to the galleys--a fate worse than mere death,\r\nfor it meant death by slow torture. And every child was forcibly\r\ntaken from its heretic parents at the age of five, and educated in a\r\nconvent.\r\n\r\nBut more than that: Roman Catholics who fled from the tyranny of the\r\npenal laws at home had no scruple, when they reached the Continent, in\r\ntaking part in persecutions far more terrible than anything they had\r\nseen in Ireland. During the dragonnades in Languedoc, Louis XIV's\r\nIrish brigade joined eagerly in the butchery of old men, women\r\nand children and the burning of whole villages. The same heroes\r\ndistinguished themselves by destroying everything they could find in\r\nremote Alpine valleys so that the unfortunate Waldenses might die of\r\nstarvation. And the Irish troops under Lord Mountcashel aided in the\r\nburning of 1,000 villages in the Palatinate of the Rhine, in which\r\nall the inhabitants--men, women and children--were slain by the sword,\r\nburnt to death, or left to perish from hunger. These persecutions were\r\npractically brought to an end by the French Revolution and the rise\r\nof modern ideas; but the ecclesiastical authorities, though they\r\nhave lost their power, have shown no sign of having changed their\r\nprinciples. Even in the middle of the nineteenth century King Victor\r\nEmmanuel was excommunicated by Pope Pius IX for allowing his Vaudois\r\nsubjects to build a church for themselves at Turin.\r\n\r\nOf course it may be said with perfect truth that two blacks do not\r\nmake one white. Still, the constant complaints about the tyranny of\r\nthe penal laws have less force when they come from the representatives\r\nof a party who acted in the same way themselves whenever they had the\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed frequently urged as a matter of aggravation that whereas\r\nother persecutions were those of a minority by a majority, this was of\r\na majority by a minority. To me, so far as this makes any difference\r\nat all, it tells the other way. As a matter of morality, I fail to\r\nsee any difference; putting all the inhabitants of an Alpine valley\r\nto death as heretics does not seem to me one whit the less horrible\r\nbecause the sovereign also ruled a large Catholic population on\r\nthe plains. On the other hand, the fact that the Roman Catholics\r\nin Ireland formed the majority of the population prevented the\r\npersecution from being strictly carried out. It was comparatively\r\neasy for Louis XIV to surround a heretic district with a cordon of\r\nsoldiers, and then draw them closer together searching every house as\r\nthey went, seizing the clergy and taking them off to the galleys; but\r\nit was impossible to track unregistered priests through the mountains\r\nand valleys of Munster. Hence the law as to the registration of\r\npriests soon became a dead letter.\r\n\r\nThere was indeed one great difference, between Irish and continental\r\npersecution. On the continent it was the holiest and best men who were\r\nthe keenest persecutors. (This may seem strange to modern readers;\r\nbut anyone who has studied the lives of Bossuet and San Carlo Borromeo\r\nwill admit that it is true.) Hence the persecution was carried out\r\nwith that vigour which was necessary to make it a success. In Spain,\r\nif a heretic under torture or the fear of it consented to recant, the\r\nHoly Office was not satisfied with a mere formal recantation; for the\r\nrest of his life the convert was watched day and night to see that\r\nthere was no sign of back-sliding; and even the possession of a\r\nfragment of the New Testament was considered as sufficient evidence\r\nof a relapse to send the wretched man to the stake. Consequently, in a\r\ngeneration or two heresy became as extinct as Christianity did amongst\r\nthe Kabyles of North Africa after the Mohammedan persecution. In\r\nIreland, however, persecution was always against the grain with\r\nreligiously-minded Protestants. Seven bishops protested against the\r\nfirst enactment of the Penal Laws; and during the period when they\r\nwere in force, the bishops repeatedly spoke and voted in favour of\r\neach proposed mitigation of them. (With this one may contrast the\r\naction of the French bishops who on the accession of Louis XVI in\r\n1774 presented an address to the new king urging him to increase the\r\npersecution of the Huguenots which had become somewhat slack during\r\nthe later years of his predecessor. By the irony of fate the same men\r\nwere a few years later pleading vainly for the mercy which they had\r\nnever shown in the days of their power.) Nor was this tolerant feeling\r\nconfined to the bishops. By the aid of the Protestant gentry, the laws\r\nwere continually being evaded. Protestants appointed by the Court as\r\nguardians of Roman Catholic children, used to carry out the wishes of\r\nthe Roman Catholic relations; Roman Catholic proprietors frequently\r\nhanded over their estates to Protestant friends as Trustees, and,\r\nthough such Trusts were of course not enforceable at law, there were\r\nvery few instances in which they were not faithfully performed. Many\r\nstrange stories are told of the evasions of the Acts. On one occasion\r\nwhilst it was still illegal for a popish recusant to own a horse of\r\na greater value than £5, a man met a Roman Catholic gentleman who\r\nwas riding a handsome horse; he held out £5 in one hand, and with the\r\nother caught hold of the bridle. The rider, naturally infuriated at\r\nthis, struck the man with his whip so heavily that he fell down dead.\r\nWhen he was tried for murder, the judge decided that as the man had\r\nlaid a hand on the bridle, the rider had reason to suppose that he\r\nintended to take it as well as the horse, which would have been\r\nan illegal act; consequently he was justified in defending himself\r\nagainst highway robbery; and therefore the charge must be dismissed.\r\nAgain, a Roman Catholic proprietor found out that an effort was likely\r\nto be made to deprive him of his estate. He rode up to Dublin on a\r\nSaturday; on Sunday he received the Holy Communion at a Protestant\r\nChurch; on Monday he executed a deed transferring his estate to a\r\nProtestant friend as Trustee; on Tuesday he was received back into\r\nthe Church of Rome; and on Wednesday he rode home again, to enjoy his\r\nestate free from further molestation.\r\n\r\nThe schools which were founded in order to convert the rising\r\ngeneration were a strange contrast to the admirably conducted\r\ninstitutions established in France and Spain for a similar purpose.\r\nThey were so disgracefully mismanaged that the pupils who had passed\r\nthrough them looked back on everything that had been taught them there\r\nwith a lifelong disgust.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that laws thus carried out were a dead failure\r\nas far as winning converts was concerned. On the other hand, they\r\nbecame in one sense the more galling as the enforcement of them fell\r\ninto the hands of a low class of informers who had no object beyond\r\nmaking money for themselves. Still, public feeling was so strong that\r\nby the middle of the century the laws had almost fallen into abeyance.\r\nBrook, writing in 1762, says: \"Though these laws are still in force,\r\nit is long since they have been in action. They hang like a sword by a\r\nthread over the heads of these people, and Papists walk under them in\r\nsecurity and peace; for whoever should adventure to cut this thread\r\nwould become ignominious and detestable.\" And in 1778 and 1782 (that\r\nis, when, as an Irish Roman Catholic writer has pointed out, there was\r\nstill neither toleration nor peace for Protestant populations in any\r\nCatholic state in Europe) the Irish Protestant Parliament formally\r\nrepealed nearly all the penal laws.\r\n\r\nProbably their most lasting effect was that relating to the tenure\r\nof land. If free purchase and sale regardless of religion had been\r\nallowed throughout the eighteenth century, one may conjecture that\r\nthe effect of the Cromwellian confiscations would long since have died\r\naway. But these laws perpetuated that peculiar state of things which\r\nhas been the cause of so much unhappiness in Ireland--the landlords\r\ngenerally belonged to one religion, and their tenants and dependents\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, As these odious laws all came to an end generations\r\nago, what is the good of recalling the sorrows of the past which had\r\nmuch better be forgotten? I reply, None whatever; and very glad I\r\nshould be if the whole subject were quietly dropped. But unfortunately\r\nthat is just what the Roman Catholic party in Ireland will not do. One\r\nof the ways in which religious animosity is being kept alive (and I\r\nregret to say is being steadily increased) is by the teaching in\r\nthe Roman Catholic schools of exaggerated accounts of the penal laws\r\nwithout referring to any of the mitigating circumstances. Even in the\r\npresent year--1913--the Lenten pastoral of one of the bishops goes\r\nback to the same old subject. If other countries acted in a similar\r\nmanner, how could the grievances of bygone centuries ever be\r\nforgotten? The Jews, cruelly treated though they were during the time\r\nof the Norman kings, do not harp on the subject in England to-day. It\r\nmay be doubted whether all the religious persecutions of Europe\r\nput together were as great a disgrace to Christendom as the slave\r\ntrade--in which, I am ashamed to say, England strove to obtain the\r\npre-eminence amongst European nations and which she forced upon her\r\ncolonies against their will. Yet I should regret it deeply if that\r\nwere the one passage of history selected for study in the schools and\r\ncolleges for coloured pupils in the West Indies at the present day.\r\nWhen a man who has suffered wrong in former years broods over it\r\ninstead of thinking of his present blessings and his future prospects,\r\none may be sure that he is a man who will not succeed in life; and\r\nwhat is true of individuals is true also of nations.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"Protestant ascendancy,\" although it never came into\r\nuse during the period with which we are dealing, has so frequently\r\nsince then been employed with reference to it, that it is necessary\r\nto explain its meaning. Probably no word in the English language\r\nhas suffered more from being used in different senses than the word\r\n\"Protestant.\" In Ireland it frequently used to be, and still sometimes\r\nis, taken as equivalent to \"Anglican\" or \"Episcopalian\"; to an\r\nIrishman of the last century it would have appeared quite natural to\r\nspeak of \"Protestants and Presbyterians,\" meaning thereby two distinct\r\nbodies. This is a matter of historical importance; for so far from\r\nthe Presbyterian element being favoured during the period of the Penal\r\nLaws, the English Toleration Act had not been extended to Ireland;\r\nPresbyterians were by the sacramental test excluded from all municipal\r\noffices; their worship, though never in practice interfered with,\r\nremained technically illegal. Their share in \"Protestant ascendancy\"\r\nwas therefore very limited.\r\n\r\nBut if the Established Church was the one favoured body, it had to pay\r\ndearly for its privileges. In truth, the state of the Irish Church\r\nat this period of its history, was deplorable. All the positions of\r\nvalue--bishoprics, deaneries and important parishes--were conferred\r\non Englishmen, who never resided in their cures, but left the duties\r\neither to be performed by half-starved deputies or not at all. Many\r\nof the churches were in ruins, and the glebes had fallen into decay;\r\na union of half-a-dozen parishes would scarcely supply a meagre\r\nsalary for one incumbent. A large proportion of the tithes had been\r\nappropriated by laymen; how small a sum actually reached the clergy\r\nis shown by the fact that the first-fruits (that is, the year's income\r\npaid by incumbents on their appointment) did not amount to more than\r\n£500 a year in all. It may be that the standard of religious life\r\nwas not lower in Ireland than it was in England when the\r\nspiritually-minded non-Jurors had been driven out and Hanoverian\r\ndeadness was supreme; but in England there was no other Church to form\r\na contrast. In Ireland the apathy and worldliness of the Protestant\r\nclergy stood out in bold relief against the heroic devotion of the\r\npriests and friars; and at the time when the unhappy peasants, forced\r\nto pay tithes to a Church which they detested, were ready to starve\r\nthemselves to support their own clergy and to further the cause of\r\ntheir religion, the well-to-do Protestant graziers and farmers were\r\nstraining the law so as to evade the payment of tithes, and never\r\nthought of doing anything further to support the Church to which they\r\nwere supposed to belong. (It is but fair, however, to state that\r\nthis condition of things has long since passed away; the Evangelical\r\nrevival breathed new life into the dry bones of Irish Protestantism.)\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely in religious matters that Ireland suffered\r\nduring this melancholy period. Students of modern history whose\r\nresearches usually commence with the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, are wont to gather from text-books the idea that the policy\r\nof the manufacturing party in England has always been liberal,\r\nprogressive and patriotic; whereas that of the landed interest has\r\nbeen retrograde and selfish. There cannot be a greater delusion.\r\nEnglish manufacturers have been just as self-seeking and narrow-minded\r\nas other people--no more and no less; they have been quite as ready\r\nto sacrifice the interests of others when they believed them to be\r\nopposed to their own, as the much-abused landowners. At this time\r\nevery nation in Europe regarded the outlying portions of the Empire\r\nas existing only for the benefit of the centre; in fact, the English\r\ndevelopment of the \"Colonial System\" even then was more liberal than\r\nthose of Spain or Holland. The English system, if perfectly carried\r\nout, was by no means unfair. The ground idea was that the mother\r\ncountry voluntarily restricted herself in matters of trade for the\r\nbenefit of the Colonies, and the Colonies had to do the same for the\r\nbenefit of the mother country. Thus, when England refused to admit\r\ntimber from the Baltic in order to benefit the Canadian lumber trade;\r\nand placed a prohibitive duty on sugar from Cuba so as to secure the\r\nEnglish market for Jamaica; it was but fair that the trade in other\r\narticles from Canada and Jamaica should be directed to England. To\r\nsay that the whole thing was a mistake, as such restrictions really\r\ninjured both parties, is no answer, as no one at that time dreamed of\r\nsuch a thing as free trade. The real answer is that it was impossible\r\nto keep the balance true; some slight change of circumstances might\r\nrender that unfair which up to then had been perfectly equal. And\r\nas the English merchants were on the spot and commanded votes in\r\nParliament, any injustice against them would be speedily rectified;\r\nthe colonists living at a distance and having no means of making their\r\nvoice heard, would be left to suffer.\r\n\r\nIn applying the colonial system to Ireland, it is true that in theory\r\nEngland undertook to protect her by means of the British army and\r\nnavy, from foreign foes; but beyond that, the system was to Ireland\r\nall loss and no gain. Every branch of Irish industry was deliberately\r\nruined by the English Government. By the Navigation Act of 1663, trade\r\nbetween Ireland and the British Colonies was forbidden; soon after,\r\nthe importation of Irish beef, mutton, pork and butter into\r\nEngland was prohibited; then, at the request of the English woollen\r\nmanufacturers, the export of woollen goods from Ireland to any country\r\nwas stopped; and finally, with a refinement of cruelty, the export of\r\nlinen articles--the one industry that had hitherto been left to\r\nthe unfortunate country--was restricted to the coarsest and poorest\r\nvarieties, for fear of offending the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this wretched misgovernment was not merely\r\ndestitution bordering on famine, but a wholesale emigration. Whilst\r\nthe Roman Catholics were leaving the country to avoid the penal laws,\r\nthe most skilful and industrious of the artizan class,--the very\r\nbackbone of the nation--were being driven out by the prohibition of\r\ntheir trades. It is said that no less than 30,000 men were thrown out\r\nof employment by the destruction of the woollen industry alone. These\r\nwere nearly all Protestants; to encourage them would have done more to\r\nProtestantize the country than all the penal laws and charter schools\r\nput together; but they were ruthlessly sacrificed to the greed of the\r\nEnglish manufacturers. Some went to the Continent, many more to New\r\nEngland and the other American colonies, where they prospered, and\r\nthey and their sons became some of Washington's best soldiers in the\r\nWar of Independence.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that thoughtful men in Ireland should cast envious\r\neyes on Scotland, which had recently secured the benefit of union\r\nwith England, and consequently was able to develop her commerce\r\nand manufactures unhindered. But though the subject of a union was\r\ndiscussed, and even referred to in addresses from the Irish Parliament\r\nto Queen Anne, no active steps were taken.\r\n\r\nStill, in considering these commercial restrictions, as in the case of\r\nthe penal laws, we must not lose sight of the fact that the state\r\nof circumstances we are dealing with has long passed away. It is\r\nnecessary for a historian to refer to it, even if he finds it hard to\r\ndo so in a perfectly dispassionate way; but it is waste of time and\r\nenergy for the present generation to go on brooding over woes which\r\nhad come to an end before their grandfathers were born. Yet that is\r\nwhat the Nationalists of to-day are doing. Not long ago, the Old\r\nBoys' Association of an Irish Roman Catholic College resolved, very\r\nlaudably, to found an annual prize at their alma mater. The subject\r\nthey selected was an essay on the treatment by England of Irish\r\nindustries before the year 1800! Had it been a Scotch or a German\r\nCollege, the subject chosen would probably have been, The progress\r\nin scientific knowledge during the last century, or, Improvements in\r\nmeans of travel since 1820; and one must ask, which subject of study\r\nis likely to be most profitable to young men who have to make their\r\nway in the modern world?\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, why did the Irish Parliament do nothing to stay this\r\nnational ruin? The answer is that the Irish Parliament possessed very\r\nlittle power. The Bill of Rights of course did not apply to Ireland;\r\ngeneral elections were very rare, and a large number of members\r\nwere paid officers of the Government; the English Parliament had a\r\nco-ordinate power of legislating for Ireland; and since Poyning's Act\r\n(as explained by the declaratory Act of George I) was still in force,\r\nno Bill could be introduced into the Irish Parliament until it had\r\nbeen approved both by the Irish and the English Councils; and the\r\nIrish Parliament might then pass it or reject it but had no power to\r\namend it.\r\n\r\nAnd the use which the English Government made of the Irish Parliament\r\nwas as disgraceful as their treatment of Irish industries. Miserably\r\npoor though the country was, it was burdened by the payment of\r\npensions of a nature so scandalous that the English Parliament even of\r\nthat period would not have tolerated them.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of land tenure also added to the miseries of the\r\ncountry. It is often said that the land belonged to wealthy English\r\nabsentees, and the unfortunate occupiers, who had no security of\r\ntenure, were ground down by the payment of exorbitant rents. This is\r\nliterally true; but, like most partial statements, misleading. Much\r\nof the land was owned by wealthy Englishmen--which of itself was a\r\nserious evil; but they let it in large farms at low rents on long\r\nleases, in the hope that the occupiers would execute their own\r\nimprovements. Instead of that, however, their tenants sublet their\r\nholdings in smaller lots to others; and these subtenants did the same\r\nagain; thus there were sometimes three or four middlemen, and the rent\r\npaid by the actual occupier to his immediate landlord was ten times\r\nthe amount the nominal owner received. As the rate of wages\r\nwas miserably low, and the rent of a cabin and a plot of ground\r\nscandalously high, how the wretched occupiers managed to keep body and\r\nsoul together is a mystery. Much has been written about the useless,\r\ndissipated lives of these middlemen or \"squireens\"; and no doubt it is\r\nto a great extent true, although, like everything else in Ireland, it\r\nhas been exaggerated. Travellers have told us of some landlords\r\nwho resided on their estates, did their utmost to improve them, and\r\nforbade subletting (in spite of the unpopularity caused by their doing\r\nso). And one of the remarkable features of later Irish history is that\r\nwhenever there was a period of acute difficulty and danger there were\r\nalways country gentlemen to be found ready to risk their lives and\r\nfortunes or to undertake the thankless and dangerous duties of county\r\nmagistrates.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how close a parallel might be drawn between the way\r\nin which Norman Ireland was Ersefied and that in which Cromwellian\r\nIreland was Catholicized. Many of those who became large landowners\r\nby the Cromwellian confiscations, having no religious prejudices (some\r\nmight say, no religious or humane feelings), when the leases of\r\ntheir tenants fell in, put the farms up to auction regardless of the\r\nfeelings of the occupiers. As the Roman Catholics were content with\r\na simpler manner of life than the Protestants, they generally offered\r\nhigher rents; the dispossessed Protestants, driven from their homes,\r\njoined their brethren in America. Then in the South, the poorer of\r\nCromwell's settlers, in some cases, neglected by their own pastors,\r\njoined the religion of the majority; in others, intermarrying with the\r\nnatives, allowed their children to be brought up in the faith of their\r\nmothers. Hence we arrive at the curious fact that at the present day\r\nsome of the most ardent Romanists and violent Nationalists, who are\r\nstriving to have the Irish language enforced all over the country,\r\nand pose as the representatives of ancient Irish septs, are really the\r\ndescendants of Cromwell's soldiers.\r\n\r\nSo passed the greater part of the eighteenth century; and the unhappy\r\ncountry seemed as far off from progress and prosperity as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER PART OF THE REIGN OF GEORGE III. THE ACQUISITION OF\r\nINDEPENDENCE BY THE IRISH PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the reign of George III we have arrived at a specially\r\ninteresting period of Irish history. For we are no longer dealing with\r\na state of society that has wholly passed away; the great events that\r\noccurred towards the close of the eighteenth century are continually\r\nreferred to as bearing, at least by analogy, on the questions of the\r\npresent day. It is for the honest historian to examine how far that\r\nanalogy is real, and how far it is delusive.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the accession of George III, the state of Ireland\r\nwas almost as miserable as before. Trade and manufactures being nearly\r\ncrushed out, want of employment brought the people in the towns to the\r\nbrink of starvation. In the country, although the middle classes were\r\non the whole becoming more prosperous, the condition of the labourers\r\nand cottiers was wretched in the extreme. It is not to be wondered at\r\ntherefore that we now hear of the commencement of two movements which\r\nwere destined later on to play so important a part in the history of\r\nIreland--the agitation against the payment of tithes and the rise of\r\nsecret societies. Few men at the present day could be found who would\r\nattempt to justify the tithe system as it prevailed in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. It was not merely that the starving peasantry were forced to\r\ncontribute towards the maintenance of a religion in which they did not\r\nbelieve, but the whole manner of levying and collecting the tithes\r\nwas bad; and what made them still more annoying was the fact that the\r\nclergy never thought of performing the duties for which tithes were\r\nsupposed to exist; the large majority of the rectors did not even\r\nreside in their parishes. The principal secret societies were the\r\nOakboys and the Steelboys of the north, and the Whiteboys of\r\nthe south. The northern societies soon came to an end; but the\r\norganization of the Whiteboys continued to spread, and for a time\r\nit assumed alarming proportions. Commencing as a war against tithe\r\nproctors, the enclosure of commons, and the substitution of grazing\r\nland for tillage, they went on to commit outrages of various sorts,\r\nand something like a reign of terror spread over a large tract of\r\ncountry. But it may safely be said that generally speaking their\r\nconduct was not nearly so violent as that of other secret societies of\r\na later date; and the evidence of any foreign influence being at\r\nwork, or of religious animosity being connected with the movement, is\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that, whenever there was a violent and\r\nabnormal outbreak of crime, the Irish Parliament did not hesitate to\r\npass special laws to meet the case. Such measures as the Whiteboy Act\r\nof 1787, or the Insurrection Act and the Habeas Corpus Suppression\r\nAct of 1796, which were readily passed whilst the Irish Parliament was\r\ncompletely independent, are frequently referred to by modern agitators\r\nas amongst the brutal Coercion Acts which the tyranny of England has\r\nforced on an innocent people.\r\n\r\nThe harshness of the Penal Laws was steadily being relaxed. All\r\nrestrictions on worship, or the number of clergy allowed, had long\r\nsince fallen into abeyance. Roman Catholic students were admitted\r\ninto Trinity College, Dublin; and the authorities of the University\r\nexpressed their readiness to appoint a Divinity Professor of their own\r\nfaith for them if they wished it. The restrictions on property were\r\nbecoming obsolete; and political restrictions were not felt so keenly\r\nsince most of the Roman Catholics would have been ineligible for the\r\nfranchise on the ground of their poverty even if the stumbling block\r\nof religion had been removed. And the loyal sentiments expressed by\r\nthe Roman Catholics made the best of the Protestants all the more\r\nanxious to repeal the laws which they had never regarded with favour.\r\nThen amongst educated people not only in Ireland but elsewhere,\r\nreligion was ceasing to be the great line of cleavage; other\r\nmatters--political, social, and commercial--were occupying men's\r\nthoughts and forming new combinations.\r\n\r\nThe political state of the country was peculiar. The real government\r\nwas carried on by the Lord Lieutenant and his officials; but as the\r\nhereditary revenue did not supply funds sufficient for that purpose,\r\nit was necessary to have recourse to Parliament. And the constitution\r\nof that Parliament was as extraordinary as most things in Ireland.\r\nA session was usually held every second year, but a Parliament might\r\nlast for a whole reign. The House of Commons consisted of 300 members,\r\nof whom only 64 represented counties, and most of the rest nominally\r\nsat for small boroughs, but really were appointed by certain\r\nindividuals. It was at one time computed that 124 members were\r\nnominated by 53 peers, whilst 91 others were chosen by 52 commoners.\r\nA large number of the members--a third of the whole house, it is\r\nsaid--were in receipt of pensions, or held offices of profit under the\r\nCrown. Of course there was no such thing as party government--in fact,\r\nparties did not exist, though individuals might sometimes vote against\r\nthe wish of the government. The Lord Lieutenant, however, managed to\r\nretain a majority by what would now be called flagrant and wholesale\r\nbribery. Peerages, sinecures and pensions were bestowed with a lavish\r\nhand; and every appointment, ecclesiastical or civil, was treated as\r\na reward for political services. But history affords many instances of\r\nhow assemblies constituted in what seems to be the most unsatisfactory\r\nway possible, have been remarkable for the ability and patriotism they\r\nhave shown; and certainly this was the case with that unrepresentative\r\ncollection of Protestant landlords, Dublin barristers, and paid\r\nofficials, who composed the Irish Parliament. A \"National\" party arose\r\n(I shall presently explain what was the meaning attached to that word\r\nat the time) who strove to win for Ireland the laws which in England\r\nhad been enacted long before and which were regarded as the very\r\nfoundations of British liberty. Statutes were passed limiting the\r\nduration of Parliament to eight years; establishing the _Habeas\r\nCorpus_; and making judges irremoveable. Afterwards, most of the\r\nPenal Laws were repealed; and at the same time the disabilities of the\r\nProtestant Dissenters were abolished.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile foreign affairs were tending to bring about changes yet\r\nmore sweeping. When England went to war with both France and Spain,\r\nthe condition of Ireland was well-nigh desperate. The country was\r\nalmost denuded of regular troops; steps had indeed been taken for the\r\nestablishment of a militia, and arms had actually been purchased; but\r\nin the hopelessly insolvent condition of the Irish Exchequer, it was\r\nimpossible to do anything further. And a French invasion might arrive\r\nat any moment. At this crisis the country gentlemen came forward. They\r\nformed their tenants and dependants into regiments of volunteers, of\r\nwhich they took command themselves, and strained their resources to\r\nthe utmost in order to bear the expense of the undertaking. And\r\nthe rank and file--farmers and labourers--seemed fired by the same\r\nenthusiasm. The movement spread rapidly over the country, but it\r\npossessed more vitality in Ulster than elsewhere. It soon became\r\nevident that Ulster volunteers may form a body not to be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of England, however, were not limited to the Continent.\r\nThe American War broke out. We, who view the question impartially\r\nthrough the long vista of years, can see that there was much to be\r\nsaid for the English claim. The mother country had been brought to the\r\nverge of bankruptcy by a long and exhausting war waged with France for\r\nthe protection of the American colonies; surely it was only fair that\r\nthose colonies, who had taken but a very small part in the war, should\r\nat least bear a fraction of the cost. But the cry of \"No taxation\r\nwithout representation\" was raised; the Americans rebelled; and\r\nEngland was placed in the humiliating position of being defeated by\r\nher own colonists. During that period Ireland remained thoroughly\r\nloyal; the efforts of Franklin and his party to enlist Ireland\r\non their side were as complete a failure as those of the French\r\nemissaries had been shortly before. But it was inevitable that the\r\nsuccess of the American revolution should have a strong effect on\r\nIrish affairs. Amongst the northern Presbyterians there had always\r\nbeen a feeling somewhat akin to Republicanism; and (as we have seen)\r\nmany of their relations were fighting in Washington's army. Then\r\nin Ireland there was something much worse than taxation without\r\nrepresentation: the English Parliament, in which Ireland had no part,\r\nclaimed to legislate for Ireland and was actually at that moment\r\nkeeping the country in a state of semi-starvation by imposing severe\r\nrestrictions on commerce. Irish politicians read the offers of\r\nconciliation made by the English Government to the revolted colonies,\r\nin which not only was the power of taxation given up and freedom of\r\ninternal legislation established, but all power of the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain over America was renounced; and began to ask whether\r\nEngland could withhold from loyal Irishmen the boons which she offered\r\nto rebellious Americans. The claims were urged in Parliament and\r\nat meetings of the volunteers and other public bodies; the English\r\nGovernment for some time refused to grant any concession; but at\r\nlength, fearing an Irish Revolution, gave way on every point. They\r\ngranted, in fact, as an Irish statesman expressed it, \"everything\r\nshort of separation.\" First (in spite of the opposition of the English\r\nmanufacturing classes) all restrictions on trade were swept away;\r\nthen, in 1782, the Declaratory Act of George I, by virtue of which the\r\nEnglish Parliament had claimed the right to legislate for Ireland, was\r\nrepealed, and with it went the right of the English House of Lords to\r\nact as a court of final appeal for Ireland; the restrictions imposed\r\nby Poyning's Act on the legislative powers of the Irish Parliament\r\nwere abolished; and the Irish Executive was made practically dependent\r\non the Irish Parliament by the Mutiny Act, which had previously been\r\nperpetual, being limited to two years.\r\n\r\nThus Ireland became a nation in a sense she had never been before. The\r\nonly tie to any power beyond sea was that the King of England was also\r\nKing of Ireland; Ireland could legislate for itself, and enter into\r\ncommercial treaties with foreign powers; but, on the other hand, it\r\nhad to pay its own debts and provide its own army and navy.\r\n\r\nAs Grattan was not merely the most prominent politician of the period,\r\nbut also the leader of the now triumphant \"National\" party, we may\r\nfairly take the views expressed by him as representative of those of\r\nthe party that followed him. A study of his speeches and letters will\r\nshow how utterly different were the ideas and aims of the National\r\nparty of 1782 from those of the Nationalists of to-day. In the first\r\nplace, Grattan was intensely loyal; that is to say, it never occurred\r\nto him that Ireland could ever wish to be independent in the sense of\r\nnot being subject to the King of England, or could seek to be united\r\nto any other power. Secondly, he was intensely aristocratic. His idea\r\nwas that Government should and would always be in the hands of the\r\npropertied and educated classes; that Parliament should consist of\r\ncountry gentlemen and professional men from the towns, elected on a\r\nnarrow franchise. (It must be remembered that the country gentlemen\r\nhad recently given evidence of their patriotic zeal by the\r\ninauguration of the Volunteer movement; and the ability and eloquence\r\nof the Irish Bar at that period is proverbial). Thirdly, he regarded\r\nProtestant ascendancy as a fundamental necessity. It is true that\r\nother politicians at the time saw that they were faced with a serious\r\ndifficulty: the very principles to which they had appealed and by\r\nvirtue of which they had obtained their legislative independence\r\nmade it illogical that three-fourths of the community should be\r\nunrepresented; whereas if votes were given to the Roman Catholic\r\nmajority it was inevitable that they would soon become eligible for\r\nseats in the Legislature; and if so, the Protestant minority must be\r\nswamped, and the country ruled by a very different class and according\r\nto very different ideas from those which prevailed in the Parliament\r\nof which Grattan was a member. And would a Roman Catholic Parliament\r\nand nation care to remain subject to a King of England whose title\r\ndepended on his being a Protestant? Grattan, however, swept all such\r\nconsiderations aside with an easy carelessness. He believed that under\r\nthe influences of perfect toleration large numbers of Roman Catholics\r\nwould conform; and the remainder, quite satisfied with their position,\r\nwould never dream of attacking the Church or any other existing\r\ninstitution. We may smile at his strange delusions as to the future;\r\nbut he was probably not more incorrect than many people are to-day in\r\ntheir conjectures as to what the world will be like a hundred years\r\nhence; and if we try to place ourselves in Grattan's position,\r\nthere is something to be said for his conjectures. At that time the\r\ninfluence of the Church of Rome was at its lowest; Spain had almost\r\nceased to exist as a European power; and in France the state of\r\nreligious thought was very different from what it had been in the days\r\nof Louis XIV. Irish Roman Catholic gentlemen who sent their sons to\r\nbe educated in France found that they came back Voltaireans; even the\r\nyoung men who went to study for the priesthood in French seminaries\r\nbecame embued with liberalism to an extent that would make a modern\r\nUltramontane shudder. Then in Ireland all local power was in the hands\r\nof the landlords; the Roman Catholic bishops possessed hardly any\r\npolitical influence. It would have required more keenness than a mere\r\nenthusiast like Grattan possessed to foresee that the time would come\r\nwhen all this would be absolutely reversed. What was there in the\r\neighteenth century to lead him to surmise that in the twentieth the\r\nlandlords would be ruined and gone, and that local government would\r\nhave become vested in District Councils in which Protestants would\r\nhave no power, but over which the authority of the bishops would be\r\nabsolute?\r\n\r\nSo Grattan and his party entered on the new conditions of political\r\nlife with airy optimism. But there were, both in England and France,\r\nshrewder and more far-seeing men than he, who realised from the first\r\nthat the new state of affairs could not possibly be a lasting one, but\r\nmust lead either to union or complete separation. Of course so long\r\nas all parties happened to be of the same mind, no difficulties\r\nwould arise; but it was merely a question of time when some cause\r\nof friction would occur, and then the inherent weakness of the\r\narrangement would be apparent. A moment's thought will show that\r\nfor Ireland to be subject to the English King but independent of the\r\nEnglish Parliament was a physical impossibility. The king would act\r\non the advice of his ministers who were responsible to the English\r\nParliament; either the Irish Parliament must obey, or a deadlock would\r\nensue. Then, suppose that England were to become engaged in a war of\r\nwhich the people of Ireland disapproved, Ireland might not only\r\nrefuse to make any voluntary grant in aid, but even declare her\r\nports neutral, withdraw her troops, and pass a vote of censure on the\r\nEnglish Government. Again, with regard to trade; Ireland might adopt a\r\npolicy of protection against England, and enter into a treaty for free\r\ntrade with some foreign country which might be at the moment England's\r\ndeadliest rival. The confusion that might result would be endless.\r\n\r\nConsiderations such as these presented themselves at once to the\r\nmaster-mind of Pitt. He pointed out that as England had relinquished\r\nher right to limit Irish trade for the benefit of English, she was in\r\nfairness relieved from the corresponding duty of protecting Ireland\r\nagainst foreign foes; the two countries should therefore both\r\ncontribute to their joint defence in proportion to their means. He\r\nproposed that regular treaties should be drawn up between the two\r\ncountries, by which Ireland should contribute a certain sum to the\r\nnavy, free trade between Ireland and England should be established,\r\nand regulations made whereby the duties payable on foreign goods\r\nshould be assimilated. By such measures as these he hoped to make\r\nthings run smoothly for a time at least; but when his projects were\r\nrejected by the Irish Parliament, he saw more clearly than ever that\r\nsooner or later the Gordian knot would have to be cut, and that the\r\nonly way of cutting it would be the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE INDEPENDENT PARLIAMENT. THE REGENCY QUESTION. THE COMMENCEMENT OF\r\nTHE REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Ireland increased in prosperity rapidly towards the end of the\r\neighteenth century, there is no doubt. Politicians will say that this\r\nprosperity came from the increased powers gained by the Parliament in\r\n1782; economists will reply that that had little if anything to say\r\nto it; far more important causes being the abolition of trade\r\nrestrictions and the relaxation of the Penal Laws, which encouraged\r\npeople to employ their money in remunerative works at home instead of\r\nhaving to send it abroad. It may sound somewhat Hibernian to mention\r\nthe rise in rents, as another cause of prosperity; yet anyone who\r\nknows Ireland will admit that it is not impossible; and it was\r\ncertainly put forward gravely by writers of the period who were by no\r\nmeans biassed towards the landlord interest. Thus McKenna, writing in\r\n1793, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"In several parts of Ireland the rents have been tripled\r\n    within 40 years. This was not so much the effect as the cause\r\n    of national prosperity; ... before the above-mentioned period,\r\n    when rent was very low and other taxes little known, half the\r\n    year was lavished in carousing. But as soon as labour became\r\n    compulsory, fortunes have been raised both by the tenantry and\r\n    landlords, and civilization has advanced materially.\"\r\n\r\nThere was also another cause of prosperity, which modern economists\r\ncannot look on with much favour. It was the policy of the Irish\r\nGovernment to grant enormous bounties for the development of various\r\nindustries, especially the growth of corn. This no doubt gave much\r\nemployment, promoted the breaking up of grass lands, the subdivision\r\nof farms and the erection of mills; and so long as the price of corn\r\nwas maintained, brought much prosperity to the country, and thus was\r\nindirectly one cause of the enormous increase of population, which\r\nrose from about 2,370,000 in 1750, to about 4,500,000 in 1797. But\r\nwhen, during the nineteenth century, prices fell, the whole structure,\r\nbuilt on a fictitious foundation, came down with a crash.\r\n\r\nNot long after the Irish Parliament had acquired its independence, a\r\ncontroversy arose which, although it had no immediate result, yet\r\nwas of vast importance on account of the principle involved. The king\r\nbecame insane. It was necessary that there should be a Regent, and it\r\nwas obvious that the Prince of Wales was the man for the post. But\r\nthe British constitution contained no provision for making the\r\nappointment. After much deliberation, the English Parliament decided\r\nto pass an Act appointing the Prince Regent and defining his powers,\r\nthe Royal assent being given by Commission. The two houses of the\r\nIrish Parliament, however, without waiting for the Prince to be\r\ninvested with the Regency in England, voted an address to him asking\r\nhim to undertake the duties of Regent, without naming any limitations.\r\nAs the king recovered almost immediately, the whole matter ended in\r\nnothing; but thoughtful men realized what was involved in the position\r\nwhich the Irish Parliament had taken up. Grattan's resolution was\r\nto the effect that in addressing the Prince to take upon himself\r\nthe government of the country the Lords and Commons of Ireland were\r\nexercising an undoubted right and discharging an indispensable duty to\r\nwhich in the emergency they alone were competent. By the Act of Henry\r\nVIII the King of England was _ipso facto_ King of Ireland. An Irish\r\nAct of William and Mary declared that the Crown of Ireland and all the\r\npowers and prerogatives belonging to it should be for ever annexed to\r\nand dependent on the Crown of England. And the Act of 1782 made the\r\nGreat Seal of Great Britain necessary to the summoning of an Irish\r\nParliament and the passing of Irish Acts. Now did the words \"King\"\r\nand \"Crown\" merely refer to the individual who had the right to wear\r\na certain diadem, or did they include the chief executive magistrate,\r\nwhoever that might be--King, Queen or Regent? It was ably contended by\r\nLord Clare that the latter was the only possible view; for the Regent\r\nof Great Britain must hold the Great Seal; and so he alone could\r\nsummon an Irish Parliament; therefore the Irish Parliament in choosing\r\ntheir Regent had endangered the only bond which existed between\r\nEngland and Ireland--the necessary and perpetual identity of the\r\nexecutive. If the Irish Parliament appointed one person Regent and the\r\nEnglish Parliament another, separation or war might be the result; and\r\neven as it was, the appointment of the Prince with limited powers in\r\nEngland and unlimited in Ireland, must lead to confusion. But more\r\nthan that; suppose that the House of Brunswick were to die out, and\r\nanother Act of Settlement were to become necessary, might not the\r\nIrish Parliament choose a different sovereign from the one chosen by\r\nEngland? Constitutional lawyers recollected that such a difficulty\r\nnearly arose between Scotland and England, but was settled by the Act\r\nof Union; and that it was the recognition of Lambert Simnel by the\r\nIrish Parliament that was the immediate cause of the passing of\r\nPoyning's Act; and saw what the revived powers of the Irish Parliament\r\nmight lead to.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Parliament had now become independent, there was still\r\nnothing like a responsible ministry as we now understand it, and the\r\ngovernment managed to maintain its control, partly by the peculiar\r\ncomposition of the Parliament (to which I have already referred), and\r\npartly by the disposal of favours. And it cannot be denied that the\r\nParliament passed much useful legislation. Two questions, however,\r\nwere now coming forward on which the whole political condition of the\r\ncountry depended, and which were closely entwined with one another.\r\nThe first was the reform of the legislature, so as to make the House\r\nof Commons a really representative body; the second was the final\r\nabolition of the Penal Laws. As to reform, the Parliament was\r\nnaturally slow (did any political assembly in the world ever divest\r\nitself of its own privileges without pressure from without?); but as\r\nto the abolition of the Penal Laws there was a cordiality which is\r\nremarkable, and which is seldom referred to by the Nationalist writers\r\nof the present day when they discourse about the Penal Laws. With\r\nregard to social matters--such as admission to Corporations, taking\r\nDegrees at the University, and holding medical professorships,--there\r\nwas hardly any hesitation; the political question, however, was more\r\ndifficult. In both England and Ireland at that time a forty-shilling\r\nfreehold gave a vote. That was a matter of slight importance in\r\nEngland, as the number of small freeholders was limited, land being\r\nusually let for a term of years. In Ireland, however, the ordinary\r\narrangement was for peasants to hold their scraps of land for life;\r\nand land having recently increased in value enormously, a large\r\nproportion of these were of the value of forty shillings. Hence, the\r\nwhole constituency would be altered; thousands of new electors, all of\r\nthem poor and illiterate, would be added in many constituencies;\r\nand the representation of the country would at once pass into Roman\r\nCatholic hands. To fix a higher qualification for Roman Catholics than\r\nfor Protestants would be not to abolish but to perpetuate the Penal\r\nLaws; to deprive the existing voters of the franchise was out of the\r\nquestion; hence the franchise was granted but not without considerable\r\nhesitation on the part of the more thoughtful members. On the other\r\nhand it was urged with great force that to give these privileges to\r\nthe uneducated mass but to continue the disabilities of the Roman\r\nCatholic gentry by not allowing them to sit in Parliament was absurd.\r\nThe proposal to abolish the religious test in the case of Members of\r\nParliament was, however, defeated.\r\n\r\nLooking back, with the light of later history to aid us, it is\r\ninteresting to see how much more correct were Lord Clare's predictions\r\nof the future than Grattan's. Grattan (as I have already explained),\r\ntaking his ideas from his lay friends among the cultured classes, and\r\nseeing the decline of the Papal influence on the continent, considered\r\nthat anyone who regarded Popery as a political influence of the future\r\ntotally misunderstood the principles which then governed human action;\r\nfor controverted points of religion (such as belief in the Real\r\nPresence) had ceased to be a principle of human action. He maintained\r\nthat the cause of the Pope, as a political force, was as dead as that\r\nof the Stuarts; that priestcraft was a superannuated folly; and\r\nthat in Ireland a new political religion had arisen, superseding\r\nall influence of priest and parson, and burying for ever theological\r\ndiscord in the love of civil and religious liberty. Clare, who was\r\nnot only a shrewder observer but a much more deeply read man, realized\r\nthat in order to find out what would guide the Roman Catholic Church\r\nin the future one must look not at the passing opinions of laymen but\r\nat the constitution of the Church; he foresaw that if the artificial\r\nsupports which maintained the Protestant ascendancy were removed, the\r\nmere force of numbers would bring about a Roman Catholic ascendancy;\r\nand in enumerating the results of that he even said that the time\r\nwould come when the Church would decide on all questions as to\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nIn order to show how far Lord Clare's expectations have been verified,\r\nI will quote, not the words of an Orange speaker or writer, but of\r\nan eminent Roman Catholic, the Rev. J.T. McNicholas, O.P., in his\r\nrecently published book on \"The New Marriage Legislation\" which, being\r\nissued with an _Imprimatur_, will be received by all parties as a work\r\nof authority. He says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Many Protestants may think the Church presumptuous in\r\n    decreeing their marriages valid or invalid according as they\r\n    have or have not complied with certain conditions. As the\r\n    Church cannot err, neither can she be presumptuous. She alone\r\n    is judge of the extent of her power. Anyone validly baptised,\r\n    either in the Church or among heretics, becomes thereby a\r\n    subject of the Roman Catholic Church.\"\r\n\r\nBut whilst politicians were amusing themselves with fervid but useless\r\noratory in Parliament, stirring events were taking place elsewhere.\r\nTo trace in these pages even a bare outline of the main incidents of\r\nthose terrible years is impossible; and yet without doing so it is not\r\neasy to obtain a correct view of the tangled skein of Irish politics\r\nat the time. In studying any history of the period, we cannot but be\r\nstruck by observing on the one hand how completely in some respects\r\ncircumstances and ideas have changed since then; it is hard to realize\r\nthat Ulster was for a time the scene of wild disorder--assassination,\r\narson, burglary and every form of outrage--brought about mainly by a\r\nsociety which claimed to be, and to a certain extent was, formed by a\r\nunion of the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic parties--whilst the south\r\nand west remained fairly orderly and loyal. And yet on the other hand\r\nwe find many of the phenomena which have been characteristic of later\r\nperiods of Irish political agitation, already flourishing. Boycotting\r\nexisted in fact, though the name was not yet invented; also nocturnal\r\nraids for arms, the sacking of lonely farmhouses, the intimidation of\r\nwitnesses and the mutilation of cattle. Again, we see all through the\r\nhistory of Irish secret societies that their organization has been so\r\nsplendid that the ordinary law has been powerless against them; for\r\nwitnesses will not give evidence and juries will not convict if they\r\nknow that to do so will mean certain ruin and probable death; and yet\r\nthose same societies have always possessed one element of weakness:\r\nhowever terrible their oaths of secrecy have been, the Government\r\nhave never had the slightest difficulty in finding out, through\r\ntheir confidential agents, everything that has taken place at their\r\nmeetings, and what their projects are.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1785 there had been two societies carrying on something\r\nlike civil war on a small scale in the north. How they originated,\r\nis a matter of dispute; but at any rate before they had long been in\r\nexistence, the religious element became supreme--as it does sooner\r\nor later in every Irish movement; whatever temporary alliances may be\r\nformed for other reasons, religion always ultimately becomes the line\r\nof cleavage. In this case, the \"Peep of Day Boys\" were Protestants,\r\nthe \"Defenders\" Roman Catholic. Some of the outrages committed by\r\nthe Defenders were too horrible to put in print; many Roman Catholic\r\nfamilies fled the country on account of the treatment which they\r\nreceived from the Peep of Day Boys, and took refuge among their\r\nco-religionists in the south.\r\n\r\nBut now a greater crisis was at hand. The terrible upheaval of the\r\nFrench Revolution was shaking European society to its foundation. The\r\nteaching of Paine and Voltaire had borne fruit; the wildest socialism\r\nwas being preached in every land. Ulster had shown sympathy with\r\nRepublican ideas at the time of the American War of Independence; and\r\nnow a large number of the Presbyterians of Belfast eagerly accepted\r\nthe doctrines of Jacobinism. Nothing can sound more charmingly\r\ninnocent than the objects of the United Irish Society as put forward\r\npublicly in 1791; the members solemnly and religiously pledged\r\nthemselves to use all their influence to obtain an impartial and\r\nadequate representation of the Irish nation in Parliament; and as a\r\nmeans to this end to endeavour to secure the co-operation of Irishmen\r\nof all religious persuasions. Some writers have tried to make out that\r\nif the Relief Act of 1793 had been extended in 1795 by another Act\r\nenabling Roman Catholics to become Members of Parliament; and if\r\na Reform Bill had been passed making the House of Commons really\r\nrepresentative, the society would never have been anything but a\r\nperfectly legal and harmless association. Of course it is always\r\npossible to suggest what might have been; but in this case it is far\r\nmore probable that if Parliament had been so reformed as to be a fair\r\nreflex of the opinion of the country, it would immediately have passed\r\na resolution declaring Ireland a Republic and forming an alliance with\r\nFrance; for whatever objects were stated in public, the real guiding\r\nspirits of the United Irish Society from the beginning (as of other\r\nsocieties of a later date with equally innocent names) were ardent\r\nrepublicans, who joined the society in order to further those views;\r\nit is absurd to suggest that men who were actually in correspondence\r\nwith the leaders of the Directory and were trying to bring about an\r\ninvasion from France in order to aid them in establishing a Republic\r\non Jacobin lines would have been deterred by the passing of a Bill\r\nmaking it lawful for Roman Catholics to sit in Parliament. Nor again\r\nis it reasonable to contend that earnest-minded Roman Catholics would,\r\nin consequence of the failure of such a Bill to become law, have\r\nrebelled against a Government under which they were able to exercise\r\ntheir religion in peace and which was at that moment founding and\r\nendowing a College for the training of candidates for the priesthood,\r\nin favour of one which had confiscated the seminaries and was sending\r\nthe priests to the guillotine. The fact seems to have been that the\r\nsociety was formed by Presbyterians, for political reasons; they tried\r\nto get the Roman Catholics to join them, but the lower class Roman\r\nCatholics cared very little about seats in Parliament; so the founders\r\nof the society cleverly added abolition of tithes and taxes, and\r\nreduction of rents, to their original programme; this drew in numbers\r\nof Roman Catholics, whose principles were really the very antithesis\r\nof Jacobinism.\r\n\r\nIt is a fair instance of the confusion which has always reigned\r\nthroughout Irish politics, that after the Relief Act of 1793 had been\r\npassed, the Catholic Committee expressed their jubilation by voting\r\n£2,000 for a statue to the King, and presenting a gold medal to their\r\nSecretary, Wolfe Tone, who was at that moment scheming to set up a\r\nJacobin Republic.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated man, Wolfe Tone, was not unlike many others who have\r\nposed as Irish patriots. Hating the very name of England, he schemed\r\nto get one appointment after another from the English Government--at\r\none time seeking to be put in command of a filibustering expedition to\r\nraid the towns of South America, at another time trying for a post in\r\nIndia; hating the Pope and the priests, he acted as Secretary to the\r\nCatholic Committee; then hating Grattan and the Irish Parliament and\r\neverything to say to it, he showed his patriotism by devoting his\r\nenergies to trying to persuade the French Republican Government to\r\ninvade Ireland.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, 1795, an incident occurred which, though\r\napparently trivial at the time, was destined to be of great historical\r\nimportance. Ulster had now for some time been in a state bordering\r\non anarchy; not only were the secret societies constantly at war,\r\nbut marauding bands, pretending to belong to one or other of the\r\nsocieties, were ravishing the country. Something like a pitched battle\r\nwas fought between the Protestants and the Defenders, in which the\r\nDefenders, although they were the stronger party and made the attack,\r\nwere utterly routed. In the evening, the victors agreed to form\r\nthemselves into a society which should bear the name of William of\r\nOrange. There had previously been some societies called by that name;\r\nbut this was the foundation of the Orange Society of the present day.\r\nThe oath which at first was taken by every member of the society was\r\nto defend the king and his heirs so long as he or they support the\r\nProtestant ascendancy. (This conditional form of oath of allegiance\r\nhas long since been abolished.) It was industriously circulated by\r\nthe United Irishmen that the actual words of the oath were: \"I will be\r\ntrue to the King and Government and I will exterminate as far as I am\r\nable the Catholics of Ireland.\" There is no evidence, however, that\r\nany words of the kind ever formed part of an oath prescribed by the\r\nOrange Society; and those who make the statement now must be aware\r\nthat they are repeating a calumny.\r\n\r\nAfter this time, the quarrel gradually tended more and more to become\r\na religious one; the Peep of Day Boys becoming merged in the Orange\r\nSociety, and the Protestants slowly withdrawing from the United Irish\r\nSociety; on the other hand, the Defenders ultimately coalesced\r\nwith the United Irishmen and thus, by an illogical combination of\r\ninconsistent forces, formed the party which brought about the terrible\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe close of the year 1796 was one of the most critical moments in the\r\nhistory of England. On the continent the power of republican France\r\nunder the genius of Napoleon and his generals was sweeping all before\r\nit. England was in a state of bankruptcy, and almost as completely\r\nisolated as she had been in the time of Elizabeth. Wolfe Tone and his\r\nIrish plotters saw their opportunity as clearly as their predecessors\r\nhad in the times of Edward Bruce and Philip II. They laid a statement\r\nof the condition of Ireland before the French Government which,\r\nthough as full of exaggerations as most things in Irish history, was\r\nsufficiently based on fact to lead the French Government to believe\r\nthat if a French force were landed in Ireland, the Irishmen in the\r\nBritish Army and Navy would mutiny, the Yeomen would join the French,\r\nand the whole of the North of Ireland would rise in rebellion.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a French fleet of forty-three sail, carrying about 15,000\r\ntroops, sailed from Brest for Bantry Bay. No human power could have\r\nprevented their landing; and had they done so, they could have\r\nmarched to Cork and seized the town without any difficulty; the United\r\nIrishmen would have risen, and the whole country might have been\r\ntheirs. But the same power which saved England from the Armada of\r\nCatholic Spain 200 years before now shielded her from the invasion of\r\nrepublican France. Storms and fogs wrought havoc throughout the French\r\nfleet. In less than a month from the time of their starting, Wolfe\r\nTone and the shattered remains of the invading force were back at\r\nBrest, without having succeeded in landing a single man on the Irish\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nHad this projected invasion taken place fifty years before, amongst\r\nthe French troops would have been the Irish brigade, who were always\r\nyearning for the opportunity of making an attack on their native land.\r\nBut half a century had caused strange changes; the Irish brigade had\r\nfallen with the collapse of the French monarchy; and some of the few\r\nsurvivors were now actually serving under King George III.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable fact that no one in the neighbourhood of Bantry\r\nshowed the slightest sympathy with the Frenchmen. The few resident\r\ngentry, the moment the danger was evident, called together the\r\nyeomanry and organized their tenantry to oppose the foe--though the\r\nutmost they could have done would have been to delay the progress\r\nof the invaders for a little at the cost of their own lives; and the\r\npeasantry did all in their power to support their efforts.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to analyse the state of political feeling at\r\nthis time, we may say that first there was a very limited number of\r\nthoughtful men who saw that after the Acts of 1782 and 1793 either\r\nseparation or union was inevitable, and who consequently opposed all\r\nidea of parliamentary reform, because they thought it would tend to\r\nseparation and make union more difficult. A second party (a leading\r\nmember of which was Charlemont) approved of the existing state of\r\nthings, and believed that it could be continued; a third (of which\r\nGrattan was one) fondly imagined that all would go smoothly if only a\r\nCatholic Relief Bill and a Reform Bill were carried, and so directed\r\nall their efforts towards those objects; and a fourth believed that\r\nno reform would be granted without pressure, and so were ready even to\r\nwork up a rebellion in order to obtain it; but that was a very small\r\nparty at best, and was soon carried away by the whirlwind of those\r\nrevolutionists who cared nothing about the Parliament then sitting\r\nin Dublin, or about any other possible Parliament which might own\r\nallegiance to the King of England, for their real aim was to sever\r\nIreland from England altogether and establish a separate republic. As\r\nWolfe Tone wrote: \"To break the connection with England and to assert\r\nthe independence of my country were my objects.\"\r\n\r\nIt is this party that is represented by the Nationalists of to-day,\r\nexcept that when they look for foreign aid, their hopes lie in the\r\ndirection of Germany rather than France. I know that this remark may\r\ncall forth a storm of denials from those who judge by the speeches\r\nwhich Nationalist leaders have made in England when trying to win the\r\nRadical vote, or in the Colonies when aiming at getting money from\r\npeople who had not studied the question. But I judge not by speeches\r\nsuch as those, but by statements continually put forward by political\r\nwriters and orators when they have cast off the mask and are\r\naddressing their sympathizers in Ireland and America:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Nationalists of Ireland stand for the complete\r\n    independence of Ireland, and they stand for nothing else. In\r\n    the English Empire they have no part or lot, and they wish to\r\n    have no part or lot. We stand for the Irish nation, free\r\n    and independent and outside the English Empire.\"--(_Irish\r\n    Freedom_.)\r\n\r\n    \"Our aim is the establishment of an Irish Republic, for the\r\n    simple and sole reason that no other ending of our quarrel\r\n    with England could be either adequate or final. This is the\r\n    one central and vital point of agreement among all who are\r\n    worthy of the name of Irish Nationalists--that Ireland is\r\n    a separate nation--separate in thought, mind, in ideals and\r\n    outlooks.

As one shrewd observer wrote: \"I look upon it that\r\nIreland must soon stand in respect to England in one of three\r\nsituations--united with her, the Legislatures being joined; separated\r\nfrom her, and forming a republic; or as a half-subdued Province.\" The\r\nsupporters of law and order were naturally divided in opinion as to\r\nthe course to pursue. Some were in favour of a policy of conciliation.\r\nGrattan induced his friend Ponsonby to bring forward another Reform\r\nBill, abolishing the religious test and the separate representation\r\nof boroughs, and dividing each county into districts; and when he saw\r\nthat the motion could not be carried, delivered an impassioned speech,\r\ndeclaring that he would never again attend the House of Commons, and\r\nsolemnly walked out. It was a piece of acting, too transparent to\r\ndeceive anybody. Grattan was a disappointed man--disappointed not\r\nso much because his proposals were not adopted, as because his own\r\nfollowers were slipping away from him. They had begun to realize that\r\nhe was an orator but not a statesman; his ideas were wild, fanciful\r\ndreams. Whilst vehemently upholding the English connection he was\r\nplaying into the hands of England's opponents by reminding them that\r\nEngland's difficulty was Ireland's opportunity; whilst hating the\r\nvery idea of a Union, he was making the existing system impossible\r\nby preventing the passing of a commercial treaty; whilst passionately\r\nsupporting Protestant ascendancy, he was advocating a measure which\r\nat that moment would have brought about the establishment either of a\r\nRoman Catholic ascendancy or more probably of a Jacobin Republic.\r\nHe saw his supporters dwindling slowly from seventy-seven in 1783 to\r\nthirty in 1797. Men were now alive to the fact that the country was in\r\nan alarming condition. They saw what had happened in France but a few\r\nyears before, and how little Louis XVI had gained by trying to pose\r\nas a liberator and a semi-republican; and, knowing that the rebellion\r\nwith which they were faced was an avowed imitation of the French\r\nRevolution, they were coming to the opinion that stern measures were\r\nnecessary. In almost every county of three Provinces conspirators were\r\nat work, trying to bring down on their country a foreign invasion, and\r\nstirring up the people to rebellion and crime by appealing to their\r\nagrarian grievances and cupidity, their religious passion, and the\r\ndiscontent produced by great poverty. For a second time it appeared\r\nthat Wolfe Tone would succeed in obtaining aid from abroad--this time\r\nfrom Spain and Holland; and the rebel party in Ireland were now so\r\nwell organized, and Jacobin feeling was so widespread, that had he\r\ndone so, it was almost inevitable that Ireland would have been lost to\r\nEngland. But once more the unexpected was destined to occur. Early in\r\nFebruary Jervis shattered the power of the Spanish Fleet off Cape St.\r\nVincent; and in the summer, just when the Dutch ships, with 14,000\r\ntroops on board, were ready to start, and resistance on the part of\r\nEngland seemed hopeless, a violent gale arose and for weeks the whole\r\nfleet remained imprisoned in the river; and when at length they did\r\nsucceed in making a start, the English were ready to meet them within\r\na few miles of the coast of Holland; after a tremendous battle the\r\nbroken remnant of the Dutch fleet returned to the harbour defeated.\r\nThe rage and mortification of Wolfe Tone at his second failure knew no\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nIn the North of Ireland, however, the rebellion had practically begun.\r\nThe magistrates were powerless; the classes who had supported the\r\ngentry during the Volunteer Movement were amongst the disaffected. The\r\ncountry was in a state of anarchy; murders and outrages of every\r\nsort were incessant. That the measures which the Government and\r\ntheir supporters took to crush the rising rebellion were illegal\r\nand barbarous, cannot be denied; that they in fact by their violence\r\nhurried on the rebellion is not improbable. But it is still more\r\nprobable that they were the means of preventing its success; just as,\r\nhad the Government of Louis XVI shown more vigour at the outset of the\r\nRevolution, the Reign of Terror would probably never have taken place.\r\nThrough evidence obtained by torture, the Government got possession\r\nof vast stores of arms which the rebels had prepared; by twice\r\nseizing the directors of the movement they deprived it of its central\r\norganization; and if they were the cause of the rebellion breaking out\r\nsooner than had been intended, the result was that they were able\r\nto quell it in one district before it had time to come to a head in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWar at best is very terrible; and there were two circumstances which\r\nmade the war in Ireland more terrible than others. It was a religious\r\nwar, and it was a civil war. It often happens that when religion is\r\nturned to hatred it stirs up the worst and most diabolical passions\r\nof the human breast; and the evil feelings brought on by a civil war\r\nnecessarily last longer than animosity against a foreign foe. The\r\nhorrors of 1798 make one shudder to think what must happen in Ireland\r\nif civil war ever breaks out there again.\r\n\r\nFrom Ulster the United Ireland movement spread during 1797 to\r\nLeinster, as far south as Wexford, and began to assume a more\r\ndecidedly religious character. As a contemporary historian wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"So inveterately rooted are the prejudices of religious\r\n    antipathy in the minds of the lower classes of Irish\r\n    Romanists, that in any civil war, however originating from\r\n    causes unconnected with religion, not all the efforts of their\r\n    gentry, or even priests, to the contrary could (if I am not\r\n    exceedingly mistaken) restrain them from converting it into a\r\n    religious quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n(Had he lived a century later, he might have used the same words.)\r\nBut though this was generally the case, there were complications as\r\nembarrassing as they usually are in Irish affairs. The yeomanry\r\nwere mainly Protestants, but the majority of the militia were Roman\r\nCatholics, and those commanded by Lord Fingall entirely so. There\r\nwas much disaffection in both branches of the service; besides which,\r\nofficers and men alike lacked the discipline and experience of\r\nregular troops; but as the supply of soldiers from England was wholly\r\ninadequate for the situation, the Government were obliged to rely on\r\nany forces they could obtain. As the rebellion drifted into being a\r\nRoman Catholic movement, the Orangemen became intensely loyal, and\r\nwere eager to fight on the king's side, but the Government dreaded\r\nlest by employing them they might offend the militia. By 1798, when\r\nthe rebellion in the south was at its height, the north had become\r\ncomparatively calm. The severities of the previous year had had some\r\nsalutary effect; the staunch Protestants had no desire to aid in what\r\nhad become a Roman Catholic rebellion; and the republican party had\r\nseen that the universal fraternity of the Jacobin Government of France\r\nhad turned into a military despotism which was engaged in crushing the\r\nneighbouring republics and was almost at war with the sister Republic\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nBut whilst Ulster was growing calmer, the condition of the south\r\nwas becoming daily more appalling. On the 23rd of May the rebellion\r\nactually broke out in the counties of Dublin, Kildare and Meath; and\r\nmany skirmishes took place in which the losses on the king's side were\r\ncomparatively few but those of the rebels enormous, in consequence of\r\ntheir ignorance of the use of firearms. The better-trained forces soon\r\ngot to know that an Irish peasant when armed with a pike was a deadly\r\nfoe; but when armed with a musket was almost harmless. This part of\r\nthe campaign will always be specially memorable for the attack made\r\non the little town of Prosperous, in the county of Kildare. It was\r\ncleverly made in the early morning; the garrison, taken unawares, were\r\nnearly all killed; the Commander, Captain Swayne, being amongst the\r\nvictims. It was soon afterwards found out that the leader of the\r\nrebels was Dr. Esmonde, a gentleman of good family, and first\r\nlieutenant in a regiment of yeomanry stationed a few miles off, who\r\nhad been dining with Captain Swayne the previous evening. He appeared\r\nin his regiment the next day, but was identified by a yeoman who had\r\nseen him at Prosperous; arrested, tried, and hanged as a traitor.\r\n\r\nA Nationalist has recently referred to him as a martyr to the cause of\r\nIrish liberty.\r\n\r\nBy the month of June Wexford had become the centre of the rebellion.\r\nIn that county it had assumed an essentially religious character\r\n(there being, however, a few exceptions on each side), and in no\r\nother part of Ireland was the war so terrible either on account of its\r\nmagnitude or barbarity. The passions of the ignorant peasantry were\r\ninflamed by all Protestants being spoken of as Orangemen and a report\r\nbeing diligently circulated that all Orangemen had sworn to destroy\r\nthe Catholic Faith--exactly the same course that was followed a\r\nhundred years later. Roman Catholic priests, wearing their sacred\r\nvestments and carrying crucifixes, led the rebel forces; and the\r\nignorant peasants, believing them to be endowed with miraculous\r\npowers, followed them with the blind adherence that only fanaticism\r\ncan inspire. And yet--so strangely contradictory is everything in\r\nIreland--there is clear evidence that amongst those priestly agitators\r\nmany were at heart deists, who were making use of religion in the\r\nhope of furthering Jacobinism. Many Protestants saved their lives by\r\napostatizing, or by allowing their children to be rebaptized; it is\r\nbut fair to add, however, that several of the older priests, shocked\r\nat the conduct of the rebels, concealed heretics in their houses and\r\nchurches; and that all through the war many priests, in spite of the\r\ndifficulty of their position, remained loyal and did what they could\r\nto aid the king's troops.\r\n\r\nThe rebels for some weeks held command of the town and county of\r\nWexford, their chief camp being at a place called Vinegar Hill. The\r\ncountry around was searched and plundered; the Protestants who were\r\ncaptured were brought into the rebel camp, and there deliberately\r\nbutchered in cold blood. How many perished it is impossible to say;\r\nthe number must have been at the least 400.\r\n\r\nI would willingly pass over this dreadful episode. I have no more\r\ndesire to dwell on it than I have on Cromwell's conduct at Drogheda.\r\nI regard it merely as one of those terrible incidents which alas have\r\ntaken place in almost every campaign. It was probably equalled in\r\ncharacter if not in magnitude by several outrages committed by the\r\nother side; and certainly parallels could be found in the French\r\ninvasion of Algeria fifty years later and in many other wars of the\r\nnineteenth century. When men have been fired with the diabolical\r\npassions that war arouses, and have grown accustomed to the ghastly\r\nsights on battlefields, they cease to be reasoning beings; they become\r\nfiends. But unfortunately it is necessary to explain what really\r\noccurred, as it is to Vinegar Hill and its terrible associations that\r\nthe Nationalists of to-day refer with triumph. Songs in praise of the\r\nmassacre are sung at Nationalist gatherings; and W. Redmond, speaking\r\nat Enniscorthy (close to the scene of the massacre) on the 110th\r\nanniversary of the outrages said: \"The heroic action of the men who\r\nfought and died around Vinegar Hill was the heritage of all Ireland.\r\nWhatever measure of comparative freedom we now enjoy was entirely\r\nattributable to the Insurrection of '98. It was the pikemen of '98 who\r\nmade the world and England understand that Irishmen knew how to fight\r\nfor their rights, and it is to the knowledge of that fact by England\r\nthat we may look for the real driving force of any effort we may make\r\nfor our liberty. The Irish people are in no position to resort to\r\narms, but the spirit is there, and by demonstrations like this we show\r\nour rulers that it is essential for any real and lasting peace that\r\nthe aspirations of the patriots of '98 must be satisfied, and that a\r\nfull measure of National freedom must be granted to Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n(It will be observed that in the opinion of this orator--a prominent\r\nNationalist Member of Parliament, who was selected to go round the\r\nColonies collecting money for the Home Rule cause--the possession of\r\nan Independent Parliament, of everything in fact short of separation,\r\ngoes for nothing; it is only those who rebelled against that\r\nParliament who are to be regarded as models for modern Nationalists to\r\nfollow. It is interesting also to note the different views which have\r\nbeen put forward by Irish politicians with regard to the rebellion.\r\nIn 1843 the leaders of the Repeal Association stated in one of their\r\nmanifestoes, as an argument in favour of repeal, that England had\r\nresorted to the diabolical expedient of fomenting a rebellion in order\r\nto distract the country and give excuse for military violence and so\r\nbring about a Union. But the Nationalists of to-day have so completely\r\nidentified themselves with the rebels of 1798 that within the last few\r\nyears splendid monuments have been erected in all the towns of Wexford\r\nand the adjoining counties; some of these are bronze figures of\r\npatriots brandishing pikes, others are representations of the priestly\r\nleaders of the rebel forces. These monuments have been unveiled with\r\ngreat ceremony, impassioned speeches being made on the occasion by\r\nleading orators, both clerical and lay).\r\n\r\nIn order to realize the terrible position in which the loyalists\r\nwere placed, we must recollect that whilst the Wexford rebels were\r\ntriumphant in that county, and the movement seemed to be spreading\r\ninto Kilkenny and Carlow, there was a fresh outbreak in the north;\r\nit appeared probable that Dublin might rise at any moment; the French\r\nfleet was hourly expected, and the long looked-for aid from England\r\nwas still delayed. But the Irish loyalist minority showed the same\r\ndogged determination that they had done in the time of James II, and\r\nthat they will show again in the future.\r\n\r\nThe numbers engaged in the different battles and skirmishes have\r\nbeen variously estimated; it seems that at the battle of Arklow the\r\nloyalists did not exceed 1,600, of whom nearly all were militia and\r\nyeomanry, with a few artillery; whilst the rebels, commanded by Father\r\nMichael Murphy, amounted to at least 20,000. Yet after a terrible\r\nafternoon's fighting the rebels, disheartened by the fall of their\r\nleader (whom they had believed to be invulnerable) retired, leaving\r\nmore than 1,000 dead on the field.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the reinforcements from England began to arrive; and\r\nthe French invasion, on which the rebels were building their hopes,\r\nwas still delayed. By July, although fighting was still going on in\r\nthe Wicklow mountains and some other parts of the country, the worst\r\nof the rebellion in Wexford was crushed, and an Act of Amnesty was\r\ncarried through Parliament. It is worthy of note that the trials of\r\nthe rebels which took place in Dublin were conducted with a fairness\r\nand a respect for the forms of law which are probably unparalleled in\r\nthe history of other countries at moments of such terrible excitement;\r\nwe can contrast them for instance with the steps that were taken in\r\nputting down the outbreak of the Commune in Paris in 1871. It is easy\r\nnow to argue that, as the force of the rebellion was being broken, it\r\nwould have been more humane to have allowed those who had plotted and\r\ndirected it to go unpunished. But as Lecky has pointed out, \"it was\r\nscarcely possible to exaggerate the evil they had produced, and they\r\nwere immeasurably more guilty than the majority of those who had\r\nalready perished.\r\n\r\n\"They had thrown back, probably for generations, the civilization of\r\ntheir country. They had been year by year engaged in sowing the seed\r\nwhich had ripened into the harvest of blood. They had done all in\r\ntheir power to bring down upon Ireland the two greatest curses that\r\ncan afflict a nation--the curse of civil war, and the curse of foreign\r\ninvasion; and although at the outset of their movement they had\r\nhoped to unite Irishmen of all creeds, they had ended by lashing\r\nthe Catholics into frenzy by deliberate and skilful falsehood. The\r\nassertion that the Orangemen had sworn to exterminate the Catholics\r\nwas nowhere more prominent than in the newspaper which was the\r\nrecognised organ of the United Irish leaders. The men who had spread\r\nthis calumny through an ignorant and excitable Catholic population,\r\nwere assuredly not less truly murderers than those who had fired the\r\nbarn at Scullabogue or piked the Protestants on Wexford Bridge.\"\r\n\r\nA strong party, however, led by Lord Clare were in favour of clemency\r\nwherever possible; and there seemed good reason for hoping that the\r\nrebellion would slowly die out. Cooke, the Under Secretary, wrote\r\non the 9th of August: \"The country is by no means settled nor secure\r\nshould the French land, but I think secure if they do not.\" Suddenly,\r\nhowever, the alarming news came that the French were actually in\r\nIreland. Wolfe Tone and his fellow-plotters, undaunted by their\r\nprevious failures, had continued ceaseless in their efforts to induce\r\nNapoleon to make an indirect attack on England by invading Ireland;\r\nand if they had succeeded in persuading the French Government to send\r\nan expedition two months earlier when the rebellion was at its height\r\nand the English reinforcements had not arrived, Ireland must have been\r\nlost. Once again, however, fortune favoured the English cause. The\r\nfirst instalment of the French fleet, carrying 1,000 soldiers, did\r\nnot start until the 6th of August, and only arrived on the 22nd. They\r\nlanded at Killala, in Mayo, and were not a little surprised at the\r\nstate of things existing there. They had expected to find a universal\r\nfeeling of republicanism; but instead of this, whilst the Protestants\r\nrefused to join them, the Roman Catholic peasantry received them with\r\ndelight, and declared their readiness to take arms for France and the\r\nBlessed Virgin. \"God help these simpletons,\" said one of the officers,\r\n\"if they knew how little we care about the Pope or his religion, they\r\nwould not be so hot in expecting help from us!\"\r\n\r\nArriving at the wrong time and the wrong place, the expedition was\r\nforedoomed to failure. The French were brave men and trained soldiers;\r\nbut they found their Irish allies perfectly useless. They succeeded\r\nin capturing Castlebar, and routing a force of militia; but\r\ntheir campaign was brief; on the 8th of September the whole force\r\nsurrendered. The Connaught rebellion was speedily and severely put\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThe second instalment of the French invasion consisted of one ship.\r\nThey landed on the Island of Arran on the 16th of September; but after\r\nspending eight hours on shore, re-embarked and sailed away to Norway.\r\n\r\nThe third instalment was, however, more serious. It consisted of a\r\nship of the line, eight frigates and a schooner, having on board\r\nan army of about 3,000 men. They arrived at Lough Swilly early in\r\nOctober, where they were met by a more powerful English fleet, and\r\nnearly all were destroyed or captured. Amongst the prisoners taken\r\nwas Wolfe Tone; who soon afterwards in order to avoid a felon's death,\r\nended his life by suicide.[See note at the end of the Volume]\r\n\r\nA fortnight later the fourth and last instalment arrived at Killala\r\nBay; but the Admiral, hearing that the rebellion was over, promptly\r\nweighed anchor and returned to France. Thus ingloriously ended the\r\nFrench attempts at the invasion of Ireland. The calling-in of the\r\nforeigner had been of as little use to the cause of Irish rebellion as\r\nit had been two centuries before.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year the worst of the rebellion was over. But the\r\nevil it had wrought was incalculable. How many had perished during\r\nthat terrible summer will never be known; the numbers have been\r\nvariously computed at from 15,000 to 70,000. At the outset of the\r\nrebellion--in February 1798--Lord Clare had made a memorable speech in\r\nthe House of Lords, which has been so often misquoted that it is well\r\nhere to cite the passage in full:--\r\n\r\n    \"If conciliation be a pledge of national tranquillity and\r\n    contentment; if it be a spell to allay popular ferment; there\r\n    is not a nation in Europe in which it has had so fair a trial\r\n    as in the Kingdom of Ireland. For a period of nearly twenty\r\n    years a liberal and unvaried system of concession and\r\n    conciliation has been pursued and acted on by the British\r\n    Government. Concession and conciliation have produced only a\r\n    fresh stock of grievances; other discontents of Ireland have\r\n    kept pace with her prosperity; for I am bold to say there\r\n    is not a nation on the habitable globe which has advanced in\r\n    cultivation and commerce, in agriculture and in manufactures\r\n    with the same rapidity in the same period. Her progress is now\r\n    retarded, and it is a heart-breaking spectacle to every man\r\n    who loves the country to see it arrested only by the perverse\r\n    and factious folly of the people, stimulated and encouraged by\r\n    disappointed statesmen.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a few months after that speech was made, Ireland was well-nigh\r\nruined. All the progress in material prosperity which had taken place\r\nin the years immediately following 1782 was swept away. The national\r\ndebt, which in 1791 had stood at £2,442,890, involving an annual\r\ncharge of £142,716, had risen to £26,662,640, with an annual charge of\r\n£1,395,735; the exports of woollen goods had almost ceased, and those\r\nof linen gone down by more than a third; other industries showed\r\na decay nearly as lamentable; public bankruptcy seemed inevitable.\r\nThough the violent outbreak of rebellion had been put down, many parts\r\nof the country were in a state of anarchy. In the west, armed bands\r\nwent about every night houghing the cattle and murdering all who dared\r\nto oppose them. If any man prosecuted one of the offenders, he did\r\nit at the moral certainty of being murdered. The same fate hung over\r\nevery magistrate who sent a hougher to gaol, every witness who gave\r\nevidence against him, every juryman who convicted him. In Limerick one\r\nman ventured on his own part and on that of eight others to prosecute\r\nan offender who had destroyed their property. All nine were murdered\r\nin one night. It was not safe to travel along the high road within\r\nsix miles of Dublin. The militia had, from their misbehaviour in\r\nthe field, and their extreme licentiousness, fallen into universal\r\ncontempt and abhorrence; officers of English regiments declared that\r\nit would be impossible to maintain discipline amongst their troops\r\nif they remained in such a country. It was discovered that the rebels\r\nwere forming another Directory, and, still expecting aid from France,\r\nplanning a fresh outbreak. Religious animosities were more violent\r\nthan ever. Government was becoming impossible; for the Roman Catholic\r\npopulation, now thoroughly disaffected, would not continue to submit\r\nto the rule of the Protestant oligarchy; but the only way to put an\r\nend to it would be by another rebellion which if successful would\r\n(as the Roman Catholic bishops and educated laymen fully realized)\r\nprobably result in the establishment of a Jacobin republic;\r\nclear-headed men of all parties were beginning to think that there was\r\nbut one solution of the problem; and that was--the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to the great turning point in the modern history of\r\nIreland--the Union. It has been so constantly and so vehemently\r\nasserted that this momentous event was prompted by the wicked desire\r\nof England to ruin Ireland, and was carried out by fraud, bribery,\r\nintimidation, and every form of political crime, that not only\r\nordinary readers, but even writers who are content to receive\r\ntheir information at second hand without investigating evidence for\r\nthemselves, generally assume that no other view is possible. Thus\r\nO'Connell boldly asserted that the Irish Catholics never assented\r\nto the Union. Others have blindly repeated his words; and from those\r\nreiterated statements has been developed an argument that as the\r\nCatholics did not assent to the Union, they cannot be bound by it.\r\n\r\nI believe that there has been as much exaggeration about this as about\r\nmost other episodes of Irish history; and that anyone who, fairly and\r\nwithout prejudice, takes the trouble to go through the history of the\r\nUnion as it may be gathered from contemporary documents, will come to\r\nthe conclusion that it was devised by great and earnest statesmen who\r\nhad the good of both countries at heart. As to the means by which it\r\nwas carried, there is much to be said on both sides of the question;\r\nLecky has stated the case against the Union ably and temperately;\r\nother writers, equally honourable, have taken the opposite side. There\r\nis at any rate very much to be said for the opinion, that, considering\r\nthe circumstances and the peculiar constitution of the Irish\r\nParliament, there was nothing which the Government did that was not\r\nperfectly justifiable. As to whether it was in accordance with the\r\nwish of the people or not, there are several points which ought to be\r\nborne in mind but to which sufficient attention is not usually given.\r\nA very large part of the nation were ignorant peasants, who did not\r\nand could not properly understand the question; and as a matter\r\nof fact cared little about it. Then of those who were against the\r\nmeasure, many opposed it not because they wished the existing state\r\nof things to continue, but because they thought that the Union would\r\nprevent the one object of their ambition--total separation and the\r\nestablishment of a republic; their opinion therefore has but little\r\nweight. When we come to the more educated and propertied classes, it\r\nseems that the majority were in favour of the measure; and as to the\r\nopinion of the Roman Catholic section (which after all was far the\r\nlargest part of the nation) I think there can be no doubt whatever.\r\nFortunately it is no longer necessary to wade through the mass of\r\noriginal papers; for the evidence has been so carefully investigated\r\nduring recent years by various impartial writers, and has been\r\npresented to the general reader in so clear and concise a manner\r\nthat no one now has any excuse for being led away by the impassioned\r\nstatements of partisan orators. I refer specially to the \"History of\r\nthe Legislative Union of Great Britain and Ireland,\" by Dr. Dunbar\r\nIngram, published in 1887.\r\n\r\nThat careful writer commences his work by stating that, dissatisfied\r\nwith endless assertions unaccompanied by proof, he had determined to\r\ninvestigate the subject for himself, examining closely the original\r\nand contemporary authorities. He soon found that there was no evidence\r\nto sustain the accusations made against the manner in which the Union\r\nwas carried; and that all the charges against the Government rested\r\nfinally on Harrington's worthless romances or the declamatory\r\nstatements of the Opposition during the sessions of 1799 and 1800,\r\nwhich, when challenged, they declined to substantiate. Then, as he\r\nproceeded in his work, he discovered that, after its terms were known\r\nand the public had had time for reflection, the Union was thankfully\r\naccepted by the two communities which made up Ireland; that the\r\nProtestants, after the first burst of clamour, were as a body\r\nconverted and became well-wishers to the measure; and that the Roman\r\nCatholics, after a short hesitation, gave the Union their hearty\r\nassent and support. And finally, the whole inquiry left a strong\r\nconviction on his mind that the Union was undertaken from the purest\r\nmotives, that it was carried by fair and constitutional means, and\r\nthat its final accomplishment was accompanied with the hearty assent\r\nand concurrence of the vast majority of the two peoples that dwelt in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nI feel that I cannot do better than follow some of the lines of his\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the time of the Plantagenets representatives from\r\nIreland were on several occasions summoned to attend the English\r\nParliament; and that during the Commonwealth Ireland was incorporated\r\nwith the rest of the Empire and sent members to the Parliaments of\r\n1654 and 1657. These incidents, however, are unimportant; it is more\r\nto the purpose to point out that from the time of the Restoration\r\nonwards we find a long list of distinguished thinkers recommending\r\nsuch a Union; and in the beginning of the eighteenth century both\r\nHouses of the Irish Parliament twice petitioned Queen Anne to the\r\nsame effect. It may be asked why the English politicians, who were so\r\nanxious to bring about the Union with Scotland, turned a deaf ear\r\nto these petitions. The answer is simple. The Scotch Parliament\r\nwas independent, and the impossibility of having two independent\r\nParliaments under one sovereign had become manifest. Trade jealousies\r\nhad arisen; the action of the Scotch had nearly involved England in a\r\nwar with Spain; the Scotch Parliament had passed an Act declaring that\r\nuntil provision was made for settling the rights and liberties of the\r\nScotch nation independently of England the successor to the Scotch\r\nCrown should not be the same person that was possessed of the Crown\r\nof England. The Parliament of England commenced arming the militia and\r\nfortifying the towns near the Border. England being at war with France\r\nthe Scotch Parliament passed an Act allowing Scotchmen to trade with\r\nthat country; it therefore was a choice between Union and War; and\r\nthe two countries wisely chose Union. In the case of Ireland, however,\r\nEngland saw no such danger; the Irish legislature was subordinate;\r\nIreland was bound by English statutes; and the Irish Parliament\r\nrepresented not the whole people but only that one section of it which\r\nwas necessarily bound to the English connection; the Irish petitions\r\nfor Union therefore remained unheeded. The great Bishop Berkeley,\r\nwriting in 1735, strongly advocated a union; at a later time Adam\r\nSmith wrote: \"By a union with Great Britain Ireland would gain besides\r\nthe freedom of trade other advantages much more important ... Without\r\na union with Great Britain the inhabitants of Ireland are not likely\r\nfor many ages to consider themselves as one people.\" But, as we\r\nhave seen, by the Act of 1782, the Irish Parliament had become\r\nindependent--that is, it was placed in the same position as the\r\nScotch Parliament had been; and by the Act of 1893, the bulk of the\r\nconstituencies in the counties had become Roman Catholic. Except\r\nin the opinion of thoughtless optimists like Grattan, matters were\r\napproaching a deadlock; for sooner or later the Roman Catholic\r\nelectors would demand representation in Parliament; the borough\r\nmembers would most probably refuse it, in which case war might break\r\nout again; and if they granted it, the Irish Parliament, then almost\r\nentirely Roman Catholic, would be anxious to break the tie that bound\r\nIreland to England.\r\n\r\nBut apart from the religious question, it was evident that the\r\nconstitution, as fixed by the Act of 1782, was fraught with dangers.\r\nAnd it is no answer to say that not many difficulties had arisen\r\nin the few years between 1782 and 1799; for, even though that is\r\npartially true, the question for a statesman to consider was whether\r\nthey were likely to arise in the future; and the rebellion, which\r\nwas still seething, had made this all the more probable. First, on a\r\ndeclaration of war by England, Ireland might refuse to take part in\r\nit; and her refusal would paralyse the Empire. As early as 1791, Wolfe\r\nTone had pointed out that Ireland need not embark on the side of\r\nGreat Britain in the contest which was then pending; and one of his\r\nfollowers had advocated an alliance with France. (This is of all the\r\nmore importance at the present day, when the Nationalists state that\r\ntheir principles are the same as those of Wolfe Tone.) Secondly,\r\nduring a war, Ireland might refuse supplies to England. This course\r\nwas actually hinted at by Grattan. Thirdly, she might provoke a\r\ncommercial war of rates with England. This course was proposed in the\r\nIrish House of Commons in 1784. Fourthly, she might put pressure on\r\nthe Sovereign to declare war against a country with which England was\r\nat peace. This also was proposed in the Irish House, in the case of\r\nPortugal. Fifthly, she might differ from England in any international\r\nquestion in reference to the connection between them, as she did in\r\nthe Regency question. Sixthly, she might refuse--as she did--to make\r\na commercial treaty with Great Britain; and thus keep open the most\r\nfertile sources of mutual jealousies and discontent. Grattan's best\r\nfriends had urged upon him in vain that refusing to assent to a\r\ncommercial treaty made the permanent government by two independent\r\nlegislatures impossible, and would bring about separation; he refused\r\nto be guided by their advice, and at that time he still had supreme\r\npower in the House. It is remarkable that even at a later date, whilst\r\nvehemently opposing the Union, he took a delight in pointing out\r\nhow many ways there were in which an Irish Parliament might injure\r\nEngland; seeming not to realize that he was supplying a forcible\r\nargument in favour of the measure he was opposing.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the situation were summed up by Pitt in a few\r\nwords:--\"A party in England may give to the Throne one species of\r\nadvice by its Parliament. A party in Ireland may advise directly\r\nopposite upon the most essential points that involve the safety of\r\nboth; upon alliance with a foreign power, for instance; upon the army;\r\nupon the navy; upon any branch of the public service; upon trade; upon\r\ncommerce; or upon any point essential to the Empire at large.\" And\r\nlong afterwards Sir Robert Peel pointed out that within the short\r\nperiod of six years from the establishment of what is called the\r\nindependence of the Irish Parliament--from 1782 to 1788--the foreign\r\nrelations of the two countries, the commercial intercourse of the two\r\ncountries, the sovereign exercise of authority in the two countries,\r\nwere the subjects of litigation and dispute; and it was more owing\r\nto accident than to any other cause that they did not produce actual\r\nalienation and rupture.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a Union was first brought before Parliament by the Lord\r\nLieutenant (Lord Cornwallis) in his speech at the opening of the\r\nSession in January 1799. It appeared at first that a majority of the\r\nPeers were in favour of the proposal, but a small majority of the\r\nHouse of Commons hostile--some to the scheme altogether, others to\r\nits being brought forward at that time. This small majority, however,\r\nrapidly diminished; and before many weeks had passed, the Government\r\npossessed a majority in both Houses. The citizens of Dublin were\r\nnaturally strongly against the measure, thinking that it would injure\r\nthe prestige of the capital; as were also the proprietors of boroughs\r\nand the legal members of the House; and soon after the scheme had\r\nbeen proposed, several counties held meetings and passed resolutions\r\nagainst it; but as the year went on, when the details of the measure\r\nhad been more carefully considered, there was a general change of\r\nfeeling throughout the country. Lord Cornwallis went on tours both\r\nnorth and south, through both Protestant and Roman Catholic\r\ndistricts, everywhere receiving addresses in favour of the Union from\r\ncorporations, grand juries, leading residents, and especially from\r\nRoman Catholic bodies. And, if we may believe Lord Cornwallis's own\r\nletters, these addresses were entirely spontaneous, and represented\r\nthe real feelings of the community. Before Parliament met in March\r\n1800, twenty-two counties had passed resolutions in favour of the\r\nUnion; and Lord Castlereagh was able to say in the House that the\r\ngreat body of the landed property of Ireland, and all the great\r\ncommercial towns except Dublin and Drogheda, were friendly to the\r\nmeasure. The Opposition attempted to meet this by presenting a number\r\nof petitions showing that the people of Ireland were against it. Of\r\nthe fifty-four petitions presented, five were not against the Union at\r\nall, but merely requests for compensation in the event of its coming\r\nabout; three were from individuals or commercial firms; and eight were\r\nfrom Dublin alone. The number therefore was much smaller than appears\r\nat first sight. Besides obtaining these petitions, the Opposition\r\nalso collected a large sum of money for the purchase of seats; in the\r\ncircumstances and according to the ideas of the time, I do not say\r\nthat they were in the least morally wrong in doing so; but the fact\r\ntakes away from the value of the votes given; and it neutralizes\r\nanything that was done by the Government in the same way--if it can be\r\nproved that the Government so acted.\r\n\r\nBut as the Roman Catholics constituted three-fourths of the population\r\nof Ireland, it is more important to investigate what their feelings\r\nwere than to scrutinize the division lists of the House, if we wish to\r\nascertain what was really the wish of the nation. Fortunately we have\r\nan opportunity of testing whether there is any truth in the statement\r\nof O'Connell to which I have already referred--that the Irish\r\nCatholics did not assent to the Union. The evidence shows conclusively\r\nthat the Roman Catholic peerage, episcopate, priesthood and laity all\r\ngave the movement their hearty concurrence and co-operation. Lords\r\nKenmare and Fingall assured Lord Cornwallis that the Catholics were\r\nin favour of a Union; the entire episcopate--that is, the four\r\narchbishops and nineteen bishops, three sees being vacant--expressed\r\nthe same view by their letters which are still extant or by\r\nresolutions signed by them; for instance, the Archbishop of Tuam\r\nwrote: \"I have had an opportunity of acquiring the strongest\r\nconviction that this measure alone can restore harmony and happiness\r\nto our unhappy country.\" The Bishop of Cork wrote: \"Nothing in my\r\nopinion will more effectively tend to lay these disgraceful and\r\nscandalous party feuds and dissensions, and restore peace and\r\nharmony amongst us, than the great measure in contemplation, of\r\nthe legislative Union, and incorporation of this Kingdom with Great\r\nBritain. I am happy to tell you it is working its way, and daily\r\ngaining ground in the public opinion. Several counties which appeared\r\nmost adverse to it have now declared for it, and I have no doubt but,\r\nwith the blessing of God, it will be effected, notwithstanding the\r\nviolent opposition of Mr. Foster and his party. The Roman Catholics in\r\ngeneral are avowedly for the measure. In the south, where they are the\r\nmost numerous, they have declared in its favour.\" The Bishop of Ferns\r\npresided at a meeting of Catholics of Wexford at which an address\r\nin favour of incorporation of both legislatures was signed by 3,000\r\npersons; and throughout the country meetings, presided over by parish\r\npriests, were held to further the movement; and the laity were quite\r\nas eager as the clergy in the matter. Plowden, the Roman Catholic\r\nhistorian, says: \"A very great preponderancy in favour of the Union\r\nexisted in the Catholic body, particularly in their nobility, gentry\r\nand clergy.\" Thomas McKenna, the Secretary to the Catholic Committee,\r\nwrote two pamphlets in the same interest; whilst on the other hand not\r\na single petition against it was presented by any Roman Catholic body.\r\n\r\nWhen the Session of 1800 commenced, a leading member of the Opposition\r\nsadly confessed that the people had deserted them. But the struggle\r\nin the House of Commons was tremendous. The Anti-Unionists had the\r\nadvantage of the oratory of Grattan, who, though he had not been in\r\nParliament since 1797, now purchased a seat for £2,400, and entered\r\nthe House in a theatrical manner in the midst of the discussion. But\r\nhis vehement and abusive style of declamation could not in debate\r\nbe compared with the calm reasoning of Castlereagh. The most able\r\nspeeches against the measure were not those of Grattan, but Foster.\r\nMany divisions were taken, the Government majority steadily rising\r\nfrom forty-two to sixty-five, and comprising an actual majority of\r\nthe members of the House. In the House of Lords it was relatively\r\nmuch larger. But it is constantly affirmed that this majority was only\r\nbrought about by bribery and intimidation. The word \"bribery\" has an\r\nugly sound; and in such a case as this, it is only fair to examine\r\nwhat is exactly meant by the term. There is no doubt that compensation\r\nwas given to the proprietors of boroughs which were not allowed\r\nrepresentation in the United Parliament; and it is said that as the\r\nreturn of members to Parliament is a public trust and not a species of\r\nproperty, this was not a fair matter for pecuniary compensation; hence\r\nit amounted to bribery. But the ownership of boroughs had grown up\r\ninsensibly; and they had long been looked upon and treated as private\r\nproperty, not only in Ireland but in England and Scotland also; and\r\nthere were many honest men in all three countries who contended that\r\nthe system worked well, as it was the means whereby a large number\r\nof distinguished men obtained their first introduction into public\r\nlife--amongst them being Pitt, Canning, and Fox in England, Grattan,\r\nFlood and Plunkett in Ireland. Then in other cases when powers which\r\nhad long been regarded as property have been abolished, compensation\r\nhas been given. This was the case when the heritable jurisdictions in\r\nScotland were abolished, and when by the disestablishment of the Irish\r\nChurch the right of patrons to nominate to livings was taken away. And\r\neven granting for the sake of argument that this is wrong, is it fair\r\nto call it bribery? Eighty-four places were disfranchised, and a sum\r\nof £1,260,000 (which did not nearly amount to the price which the\r\nboroughs at that time fetched in the market) was paid. Of this,\r\n£67,500 was paid to Englishmen who owned seats in the Irish\r\nParliament; £60,000 to boroughs who had no owners; £30,000 to the\r\nexecutors of a deceased owner; £18,750 to two ladies; and\r\n£1,100,000 to Irishmen who owned boroughs--of which £400,000 went to\r\nAnti-Unionists who opposed the Bill. In many cases, of course, the\r\nactual occupant of the seat was a different person from the owner who\r\nreceived the compensation; for instance, there is reason to believe\r\nthat all the fifty barristers in the house had purchased their seats,\r\nbut not one of them was the permanent owner. Now, if compensation\r\nis bribery, who was bribed? Really it must be admitted that\r\non investigation the charge of bribery, so far as it refers to\r\ncompensation to borough-owners, falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nThen it is said that the Government made actual payments to members\r\nfor their votes. This charge was brought forward in a general way at\r\nthe time in both Houses; the Government indignantly denied it, and\r\ncalled on the Opposition to prove their accusation; but they failed to\r\ndo so. To repeat it now is therefore unjust. It may be admitted that\r\namongst Lord Castlereagh's letters there is one which taken by itself\r\nlooks as if a certain sum of money was to be used in bribery; but,\r\nas Dr. Ingram has pointed out, a careful investigation of the matter\r\nshows that it refers to proposed changes in the tariff, and not to\r\nbribery at all.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is argued that the lavish distribution of titles amounted\r\nto bribery. If so, it is hard to find any Government in England or\r\nIreland that has not been to some extent guilty of bribery--though it\r\nis true that no British Premier has ever created peerages or salaried\r\noffices on anything like the scale that Mr. Asquith has done. After\r\nthe Bill had passed, Pitt created twenty new Irish peerages and four\r\nEnglish ones; and promoted sixteen peers a step in their order; which\r\nafter all is not very much more than Lord North had done in 1779, on\r\nno special occasion, when he had created eighteen Irish peerages and\r\npromoted twelve existing peers.\r\n\r\nAs to the charges of intimidation, they may be dismissed at once; the\r\nvery few that were brought forward were so completely answered at the\r\ntime, that even the Opposition dropped them. The presence of such a\r\nlarge number of troops in Ireland was quite accounted for by the fact\r\nthat the rebellion was still to some extent going on, and that there\r\nwas again a danger of a French invasion.\r\n\r\nAnd I must contend further that even admitting that there were\r\nsome acts on the part of the Government which will not bear strict\r\ninvestigation according to present ideas, it is only fair to remember\r\nthe tremendous difficulties of the occasion. The English House of\r\nCommons was almost unanimously in favour of the Union--not more than\r\nthirty members ever voted against it; and in the opinion of Lord\r\nCornwallis, who throughout his long and varied career showed himself\r\nto be a shrewd observer and an upright, honourable man, \"This country\r\ncould not be saved without the Union.\"\r\n\r\nBut really the whole discussion is beside the mark. The Nationalists\r\ncontinually repeat the charge that the Union was carried by fraud; and\r\nso it must be answered; but it has no bearing on anything existing at\r\nthe present day. For the old Irish Parliament has disappeared--merged\r\nin the greater and more honourable Assembly of the United Kingdom; and\r\nto revive it now would be a physical impossibility. The whole state\r\nof circumstances has changed; no assembly that could now be formed in\r\nIreland would bear the faintest resemblance to that which met in the\r\neighteenth century. As Lecky has well expressed it:--\r\n\r\n    \"To an historian of the eighteenth century, however, few\r\n    things can be more grotesquely absurd than to suppose that the\r\n    merits or demerits, the failure or the successes of the\r\n    Irish Parliament has any real bearing on modern schemes for\r\n    reconstructing the Government of Ireland on a revolutionary\r\n    and Jacobin basis; entrusting the protection of property and\r\n    the maintenance of law to some democratic assembly consisting\r\n    mainly of Fenians and Land-leaguers, of paid agitators and\r\n    of penniless adventurers. The Parliamentary system of the\r\n    eighteenth century might be represented in very different\r\n    lights by its enemies and by its friends. Its enemies would\r\n    describe it as essentially a government carried on through the\r\n    instrumentality of a corrupt oligarchy, of a large, compact\r\n    body of members holding place and pensions at the pleasure of\r\n    the Government, removed by the system of rotten boroughs from\r\n    all effectual popular control. Its friends would describe it\r\n    as essentially the government of Ireland by the gentlemen of\r\n    Ireland and especially the landlord class.\r\n\r\n    \"Neither representation would be altogether true, but each\r\n    contains a large measure of truth. The nature of the Irish\r\n    constituencies and the presence in the House of Commons of a\r\n    body of pensioners and placemen forming considerably more than\r\n    a third of the whole assembly, and nearly half of its active\r\n    members, gave the Government a power, which, except under\r\n    very rare and extraordinary circumstances, must, if fully\r\n    exercised, have been overwhelming ... On the other hand,\r\n    the Irish Parliament was a body consisting very largely of\r\n    independent country gentlemen, who on nearly all questions\r\n    affecting the economical and industrial development of the\r\n    country, had a powerful if not a decisive influence ... and\r\n    it was in reality only in a small class of political questions\r\n    that the corrupt power of government seems to have been\r\n    strained. The Irish House of Commons ... comprised the flower\r\n    of the landlord class. It was essentially pre-eminently the\r\n    representative of the property of the country. It had all the\r\n    instincts and the prejudices, but also all the qualities\r\n    and the capacities, of an educated propertied class, and it\r\n    brought great local knowledge and experience to its task. Much\r\n    of its work was of that practical and unobtrusive character\r\n    which leaves no trace in history.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD FROM THE UNION UNTIL THE REJECTION OF THE FIRST HOME RULE\r\nBILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Union had become law, the opposition to it died down\r\nrapidly. All the members who had voted for it who became candidates\r\nfor the Imperial Parliament were elected, and Irish orators soon began\r\nto make their mark in the greater Assembly. In 1805, however, there\r\nwas another slight rebellion, led by Robert Emmett. It never had\r\na chance of success; the mass of the people, thoroughly tired of\r\nanarchy, refused to take part in it; and though the rebels succeeded\r\nin committing a few murders, the movement was speedily quelled, mainly\r\nby the yeomen of Dublin. At the trial of Emmett, Plunket, who had been\r\na vehement opponent of the Union, was counsel for the prosecution, and\r\nin his speech bitterly denounced the conduct of those men who,\r\nhaving done their utmost to oppose the Irish Parliament, now made the\r\nabolition of that Parliament the pretext for rebellion. \"They call for\r\nrevenge,\" said he, \"on account of the removal of the Parliament. These\r\nmen, who, in 1798, endeavoured to destroy the Parliament, now\r\ncall upon the loyal men who opposed its transfer, to join them in\r\nrebellion; an appeal vain and fruitless.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from statements already quoted, that the\r\nNationalists of to-day claim that they are the successors of\r\nEmmett; he is counted amongst the heroes who fell in the cause of\r\nIreland--thus making it all the more clear how wide is the gulf\r\nbetween the Parliamentary opponents of the Union and the modern\r\nNationalists.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the century, Ireland had another period of\r\nprosperity. Travellers through Ireland at the present day cannot fail\r\nto notice how many of the country seats (now, in consequence of later\r\nlegislation, mostly deserted and already beginning to fall into ruin)\r\nwere built at that time. No doubt much of the prosperity was caused\r\nby the rebound which often takes place after a period of anarchy and\r\ndesolation; and it would not be fair to attribute it wholly to the\r\neffect of the Union; but at least it proves that the melancholy\r\nprognostications of the opponents of the measure were happily\r\nunfulfilled. The total value of the produce and manufactures exported\r\nfrom Ireland between 1790 and 1801 amounted to £51,322,620; between\r\n1802 and 1813 it amounted to £63,483,718. In 1800 the population\r\nof Ireland was under 5,000,000; in 1841 it was over 8,000,000. The\r\ntonnage in Irish ports in 1792 was 69,000; by 1797 it had fallen to\r\n53,000; before 1852 it had risen to 5,000,000. The export of linen\r\nin 1796 was 53,000,000 yards; in 1799 it had fallen to 38,000,000;\r\nin 1853 it had risen to 106,000,000; and every other department of\r\nindustry and commerce showed figures almost as satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, three important measures which the leading\r\nadvocates of the Union had desired to see carried as soon as possible\r\nafter the great change had been effected, but which--as many writers\r\nof various schools of thought to this day consider unfortunately--were\r\npostponed. The first was a provision by the State for the payment of\r\nthe Roman Catholic clergy. The bishops had fully expected that this\r\nwould be carried. Some modern Nationalists, wishing to win the\r\nfavour of the English Nonconformists, have represented that the Roman\r\nCatholic Church refused to accept the money; but that is not the case.\r\nWhether the policy of \"levelling up\" would have been a wise one\r\nor not, it is useless now to conjecture; for once the policy of\r\n\"levelling down\" had been decided upon, and the Irish Church had been\r\ndisestablished and disendowed, it became impracticable. The second\r\nmeasure was Roman Catholic emancipation. This had been intended by\r\nPitt and other statesmen who helped to bring about the Union; but\r\nunforeseen difficulties arose; and unfortunately nothing was done\r\nuntil the agitation led by O'Connell brought matters to a crisis;\r\nand the emancipation which might have been carried gracefully years\r\nbefore, and in that case would have strengthened the Union, was\r\ngrudgingly yielded in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe third measure was a readjustment of tithes. All will now admit,\r\nand very many politicians and thinkers at the time fully realized,\r\nthat the old law as to tithes was a cruel injustice; but no change\r\nwas made until the opposition to the payment of tithes amounted to\r\nsomething like civil war, involving a series of murders and outrages.\r\nThen the fatal precedent was set of a successful and violent revolt\r\nagainst contracts and debts. In 1838 an Act was passed commuting\r\nthe tithes into a rent-charge payable not by the occupiers but the\r\nlandlords. Some modern writers have argued that the change was merely\r\na matter of form, as the landlords increased the rents in proportion;\r\nand it seems such a natural thing to have happened that earlier\r\nwriters may well be excused for assuming that it actually occurred.\r\nBut there is no excuse for repeating the charge now; for in\r\nconsequence of recent legislation it has been necessary for the Land\r\nCourts to investigate the history of rents from a period commencing\r\nbefore 1838; and the result of their examination has elicited the\r\nstrange fact that in thousands of cases the rent remained exactly the\r\nsame that it had been before the Tithe Commutation Act was passed.\r\n\r\nBut ere long economic causes were at work which tended to check the\r\nprosperity of Ireland. It was soon found that the proportion which by\r\nthe Act of Union Ireland was to contribute to the Imperial Government\r\nwas too large for the country to bear. The funded debt of Ireland\r\nwhich amounted to £28,000,000 in 1800 rose by 1817 to £130,000,000;\r\nin that year the whole liability was taken over by the Imperial\r\nGovernment. Then the fall in prices which naturally resulted from\r\nthe peace of 1815 pressed heavily on an agricultural community.\r\nImprovements in machinery and the development of steam power squeezed\r\nout the handlooms of Ulster and the watermills of other parts of the\r\ncountry. Wages were low; and the people who depended mainly on the\r\npotato were underfed and undernourished. In 1846 and 1847 came the\r\ntwo terrible blows to Ireland--first, the potato disease; and then the\r\nRepeal of the Corn Laws, which made the profitable growing of wheat\r\nwith its accompanying industries, impossible. During the fearful years\r\nof the potato famine, it is only too probable that some of the efforts\r\nfor relief were unwisely conducted and that some persons sadly failed\r\nin their duties; no measures or men in the world are ever perfect; and\r\nthe difficulties not only of obtaining food but of getting it to the\r\nstarving people in days when there were few railways and no motors\r\nwere enormous. But when modern writers shower wholesale abuse over\r\nthe landlords of the period, and even hint that they brought about the\r\nfamine, it is well to turn to the writings of an ardent Home Ruler,\r\nwho was himself an eye-witness, having lived as a boy through the\r\nfamine time in one of the districts that suffered most--Mr. A.M.\r\nSullivan. He says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The conduct of the Irish landlords throughout the famine\r\n    period has been variously described, and has been, I believe,\r\n    generally condemned. I consider the censure visited on them\r\n    too sweeping. I hold it to be in some respects cruelly unjust.\r\n    On many of them no blame too heavy could possibly fall.\r\n    A large number were permanent absentees; their ranks were\r\n    swelled by several who early fled the post of duty at\r\n    home--cowardly and selfish deserters of a brave and faithful\r\n    people. Of those who remained, some may have grown callous;\r\n    it is impossible to contest authentic instances of brutal\r\n    heartlessness here and there. But granting all that has to be\r\n    entered on the dark debtor side, the overwhelming balance\r\n    is the other way. The bulk of the resident Irish landlords\r\n    manfully did their best in that dread hour ... No adequate\r\n    tribute has ever been paid to the memory of those Irish\r\n    landlords--they were men of every party and creed--perished\r\n    martyrs to duty in that awful time; who did not fly the\r\n    plague-reeking work-houses or fever-tainted court. Their names\r\n    would make a goodly roll of honour ... If they did too little\r\n    compared with what the landlord class in England would have\r\n    done in similar case, it was because little was in their\r\n    power. The famine found most of the resident gentry of Ireland\r\n    on the brink of ruin. They were heritors of estates heavily\r\n    overweighted with the debts of a bygone generation. Broad\r\n    lands and lordly mansions were held by them on settlements\r\n    and conditions that allowed small scope for the exercise\r\n    of individual liberality. To these landlords the failure of\r\n    year's rental receipts meant mortgage fore-one and hopeless\r\n    ruin. Yet cases might be named by the score in which such men\r\n    scorned to avert by pressure on their suffering tenantry the\r\n    fate they saw impending over them.... They 'went down with the\r\n    ship.'\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the famine, the Incumbered Estates Act was passed, by which\r\nthe creditors of incumbered landlords could force a sale. This in\r\neffect worked a silent revolution; for whatever might have been said\r\nup to that time about the landed proprietors being the representatives\r\nof those who acquired their estates through the Cromwellian\r\nconfiscations, after those proprietors had been forced to sell and the\r\npurchasers had obtained a statutory title by buying in the Court, the\r\ncharge became obsolete. The motive of the Act was a good one; it\r\nwas hoped that land would thus pass out of the hands of impoverished\r\nowners and be purchased by English capitalists who would be able to\r\nexecute improvements on their estates and thus benefit the country\r\nas a whole. But the scheme brought with it disadvantages which the\r\nframers of the Act had not foreseen. The new purchasers had none of\r\nthe local feelings of the dispossessed owners; they regarded their\r\npurchases as an investment, which they wished to make as profitable as\r\npossible, and treated the occupants of the land with a harshness which\r\nthe old proprietors would never have exercised. Like most things in\r\nIreland, however, this has been much exaggerated. It is constantly\r\nassumed that the whole soil of Ireland after this belonged to absentee\r\nproprietors who took no interest in the country. That absenteeism is a\r\ngreat evil to any country, and to Ireland especially, no one can deny;\r\nbut a Parliamentary enquiry in 1869 elicited the fact that the number\r\nof landed proprietors in the rural area of Ireland then (and there\r\nis no reason to suppose that any great change had taken place in\r\nthe previous eighteen years) was 19,547, of whom only 1,443 could\r\nbe described as \"rarely or never resident in Ireland\"; and these\r\nrepresented 15.7 per cent. of the rural area, and only 15.1 per cent.\r\nof the total poor-law valuation of that area.\r\n\r\nBetween 1841 and 1851 the population of the country fell from\r\n8,200,000 to 6,574,000. The primary causes of this were of course the\r\nfamine and the fever which broke out amongst the half-starved people;\r\nbut it was also to a large extent caused by emigration. A number\r\nof devoted and noble-hearted men, realizing that it was hopeless to\r\nexpect that the potato disease would disappear, and that consequently\r\nthe holdings had become \"uneconomic\" (to use the phrase now so\r\npopular) as no other crop was known which could produce anything\r\nlike the same amount of food, saw that the only course to prevent a\r\ncontinuation of the famine would be to remove a large section of the\r\npeople to a happier country. In this good work the Quakers, who had\r\nbeen untiring in their efforts to relieve distress during the famine,\r\ntook a prominent part; and the Government gave assistance. At the\r\ntime no one regarded this as anything but a beneficent course; for the\r\nemigrants found better openings in new and rising countries than\r\nthey ever could have had at home, and the reduced population, earning\r\nlarger wages, were able to live in greater comfort. One evidence of\r\nthis has been that mud cabins, which in 1841 had numbered 491,000\r\nhad in 1901 been reduced to 9,000; whilst the best class of houses\r\nincreased from 304,000 to 596,000. In 1883 the Roman Catholic bishops\r\ncame to the conclusion that matters had gone far enough, and that in\r\nfuture migration from the poorer to the more favoured districts was\r\nbetter than emigration from the country; but they did not say anything\r\nagainst the work that had been done up to that time. Yet a recent\r\nNationalist writer, wishing to bring every possible charge against the\r\nlandlords, has hinted that the total loss of population from 1841 to\r\n1901 was caused by the brutality of the landlords after the famine,\r\nwho drove the people out of the country! To show the fallacy of this,\r\nit is sufficient to point out that the powers of the landlords for\r\ngood or evil were considerably reduced by the Land Act of 1870, and\r\nafter that they were further diminished by each successive Act until\r\nthe last shred was taken away by the Act of 1887; yet the population\r\nwent down from 5,412,377 in 1871 to 4,453,775 in 1901--the emigration\r\nbeing larger in proportion from those counties where the National\r\nLeague was omnipotent than from other parts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the early thirties O'Connell commenced his famous agitation for the\r\nRepeal of the Union. After he had disappeared from the scene, his work\r\nwas taken up by those of his followers who advocated physical force;\r\nand in 1848 an actual rebellion broke out, headed by Smith O'Brien. It\r\nended in a ridiculous fiasco. The immediate cause of its failure, as\r\nA.M. Sullivan has pointed out, was that the leaders, in imitation of\r\nthe movement of half a century before, endeavoured to eliminate the\r\nreligious difficulty and to bring about a rising in which Orange\r\nand Green should be united; but their fight for religious tolerance\r\nexposed them to the charge of infidelity; the Roman Catholic priests\r\n(who now possessed immense political influence) denounced them; and\r\ntheir antagonism was fatal to the movement.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most far-seeing of the party--J.F. Lalor--perceived\r\nthat mere repeal would never be strong enough to be a popular cry--it\r\nmust be hitched on to some more powerful motive, which could drag it\r\nalong. As he clearly explained in his manifesto, his objects were the\r\nabolition of British government and the formation of a National one.\r\nHe considered that neither agitation nor the attempt at military\r\ninsurrection were likely to attain those objects, but that the wisest\r\nmeans for that end were the refusal of obedience to usurped authority;\r\ntaking quiet possession of all the rights and powers of government and\r\nproceeding to exercise them; and defending the exercise of such powers\r\nif attacked. He saw that the motive power which would carry itself\r\nforward and drag repeal with it, was in the land. He held that the\r\nsoil of the country belonged as of right to the entire people of that\r\ncountry, not to any one class but to the nation--one condition being\r\nessential, that the tenant should bear true and undivided allegiance\r\nto the nation whose land he held, and owe no allegiance whatever to\r\nany other prince, power or people, or any obligation of obedience or\r\nrespect to their will, their orders, or their laws. The reconquest\r\nof the liberties of Ireland, he argued, would, even if possible by\r\nitself, be incomplete and worthless, without the reconquest of the\r\nland; whereas the latter, if effected, would involve the former. He\r\ntherefore recommended (1) That occupying tenants should at once refuse\r\nto pay all rent except the value of the overplus of harvest produce\r\nremaining in their hands after deducting a full provision for their\r\nown subsistence during the ensuing year; (2) that they should forcibly\r\nresist being made homeless under the English law of ejectment; (3)\r\nthat they ought further on principle to refuse _all_ rent to the\r\npresent usurping proprietors, until they should in National Convention\r\ndecide what rents they were to pay and to whom they should pay them;\r\nand (4) that the people, on grounds of policy and economy, should\r\ndecide that those rents should be paid to themselves--the people--for\r\npublic purposes for the benefit of the entire general people. In\r\nthat way a mighty social revolution would be accomplished, and the\r\nfoundation of a national revolution surely laid.\r\n\r\nBut these views, though shared by J. Mitchel and other leaders, were\r\nnot at the time generally adopted; and the next agitations were more\r\ndistinctly political than agrarian. The Fenian movement of 1865--1867,\r\nthe avowed object of which was the establishment of an independent\r\nrepublic, arose in America, where it was cleverly devised and ably\r\nfinanced. In Ireland it met with little sympathy except in the towns;\r\nand the attempted outbreaks, both there and in Canada, were dismal\r\nfailures. Two of their efforts in England, however, led to important\r\nresults. Gladstone made the remarkable statement that it was their\r\nattempt to blow up Clerkenwell prison that enabled him to carry\r\nthe Act for the Disestablishment of the Irish Church. Many years\r\nafterwards, when this encouragement to incendiarism had done its work,\r\nhe denied that he had ever said so; but there is no doubt that he did.\r\n\r\nHere I must digress for a moment to refer to the position of the Irish\r\nChurch. By the Act of Union it had been provided that the Churches of\r\nEngland and Ireland as then by law established should be united, and\r\nthat the continuation and preservation of the United Church should be\r\ndeemed and taken to be an essential and fundamental part of the Union;\r\nand at the time of the agitation for Catholic emancipation the Roman\r\nCatholic Bishops of Ireland solemnly declared that their Church\r\nwould never attempt to destroy the Protestant Establishment. This is\r\ninteresting as showing how futile are the attempts of one generation\r\nto bind posterity by legislation; and how foolish it is to expect\r\nthat men will regard themselves as bound by promises made by their\r\nancestors. (The same remark may be made with reference to the promises\r\nnow being made by Nationalists as to the Home Rule Bill.) The general\r\nprovisions of the Disestablishment Act were simple. Existing clergy\r\nwere secured in their incomes for life; the disestablished Church\r\nwas allowed to claim all churches then in actual use, and to purchase\r\nrectory houses and glebes at a valuation; and a sum of £500,000 was\r\ngiven to the Church in lieu of all private endowments. Everything\r\nelse--even endowments given by private persons a few years before the\r\nAct was passed--was swept away. The members of the Church showed a\r\nliberality which their opponents never anticipated. They bought the\r\nglebes, continued to pay their clergy by voluntary assessments, and\r\ncollected a large sum of money towards a future endowment. Nationalist\r\nwriters now state that the Act left the Irish Church with an income\r\nadequate to its needs and merely applied the surplus revenues to other\r\npurposes; and hint that the capital sum now possessed by the Church\r\nreally came from the State, and that therefore the future Home Rule\r\nGovernment can deal with it as they please. The alarm felt by Irish\r\nChurchmen at the prospect can be understood.\r\n\r\nThe other Fenian attempt in England which has historical importance\r\nwas of a different kind. Two Fenian prisoners were being conveyed in a\r\nprison van at Manchester. Their friends tried to rescue them by force;\r\nand in the attempt killed the officer in charge. For this crime, three\r\nof them--Allen, Larkin and O'Brien--were tried, convicted and hanged\r\nin November 1867. These were the \"Manchester Martyrs,\" in honour of\r\nwhose unflinching fidelity to faith and country (to quote the words\r\nof Archbishop Croke) so many memorial crosses have been erected,\r\nand solemn demonstrations are held every year to this day. At the\r\nunveiling of the memorial cross at Limerick the orator said: \"Allen,\r\nLarkin and O'Brien died as truly for the cause of Irish Nationality as\r\ndid any of the heroes of Irish history. The same cause nerved the arms\r\nof the brave men of '98, of '48, of '65 and '67. For the cause that\r\nhad lived so long they would not take half measures--nothing else\r\nwould satisfy them than the full measure of Nationality for which they\r\nand their forefathers had fought.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another movement was going on, which seems to have been at\r\nfirst wholly distinct from the Fenian conspiracy--the constitutional\r\nagitation for Home Rule or Repeal, led by Isaac Butt. It commenced its\r\nParliamentary action in 1874; but was ere long broken up by the more\r\nviolent spirits within its own ranks. As had so frequently happened in\r\nsimilar movements in Ireland, France and elsewhere, the moderate\r\nmen were thrust aside, and the extremists carried all before them.\r\nFenianism, though apparently crushed in Ireland, continued to flourish\r\nin America. Michael Davitt, who had been a prominent member both of\r\nthe Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood and of the Fenian Society, had\r\nbeen convicted of treason felony, and sentenced to penal servitude. On\r\nhis release in 1877, he was received as a hero, and amongst those who\r\ntook part in the welcome to him were C.S. Parnell, J.G. Biggar, J.\r\nCarey, D. Curley and J. Brady. He went to America and there matured\r\nthe plan of his operations on the lines laid down by Lalor, which he\r\nproceeded to carry out in Ireland in 1879 by means of a Society which\r\nwas at first called the \"Land League\" but which has since been known\r\nby various other names. Amongst his allies were J. Devoy, O'Donovan\r\nRossa, and Patrick Ford. Devoy and Rossa took an active part in\r\nestablishing the Skirmishing Fund, which was subscribed for the\r\npurpose of levying war on England with dynamite. Rossa afterwards\r\npublicly boasted that he had placed an infernal machine onboard H.M.S.\r\n\"Dottrell,\" and had sent it and all its crew to the bottom of the\r\nocean. As a reward for his patriotic conduct he was some years later\r\ngranted a pension by the County Council of Cork, payable out of the\r\nrates. Ford was the ablest and most powerful of the number, for by\r\nmeans of his paper--the _Irish World_--he collected vast sums for the\r\nParliamentary party. In this paper he strongly advocated the use of\r\ndynamite as a blessed agent which should be availed of by the Irish\r\npeople in their holy war; and elaborated a scheme for setting fire to\r\nLondon in fifty places on a windy night. After D. Curley and J. Brady\r\nhad been hanged for the murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr.\r\nBurke, he collected money for a testimonial to them as heroes, and\r\nprayed that God would send Ireland more men with hearts like that of\r\nJ. Brady. Mr. Redmond has recently described him as \"the grand old\r\nveteran, who through his newspaper has done more for the last thirty\r\nor forty years for Ireland than almost any man alive\"; Mr. T.P.\r\nO'Connor has congratulated him on the great work he is doing for\r\nIreland; and Mr. Devlin has eulogized him for \"the brilliancy in the\r\nexposition of the principles inculcated in our programme.\"\r\n\r\nBy 1880 the union between the Dynamite party in America (which bore\r\nmany names, such as the Fenian Society, the Irish Revolutionary\r\nBrotherhood, the Invincibles, the Clan-na-gael, and the Physical\r\nForce party, but was essentially the same movement throughout), the\r\nconstitutional agitators for Home Rule in Parliament, and the Land\r\nLeaguers in Ireland, was complete. It was but natural that it should\r\nbe so, for their objects were the same, though their methods differed\r\naccording to circumstances. The American party (according to their own\r\nstatements) desired the achievement of a National Parliament so as\r\nto give them a footing on Irish soil--to give them the agencies and\r\ninstrumentalities for a Government _de facto_ at the very commencement\r\nof the Irish struggle--to give them the plant of an armed revolution.\r\nHence they gladly contributed large sums for the Parliamentary Fund.\r\nParnell, the leader of the Parliamentary party, stated that a true\r\nrevolutionary movement should partake of a constitutional and\r\nan illegal character; it should be both an open and a secret\r\norganization, using the constitution for its own purpose and also\r\ntaking advantage of the secret combination; and (as the judges at the\r\nParnell Commission reported) the Land League was established with the\r\nintention of bringing about the independence of Ireland as a separate\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding autumn the agitation against the payment of rent had\r\nbegun; and persons of ordinary intelligence could see that a fresh\r\noutbreak of anarchy was imminent. But Gladstone, when coming into\r\npower in March 1880, assumed that air of easy optimism which his\r\nsuccessors in more recent times have imitated; and publicly stated\r\nthat there was in Ireland an absence of crime and outrage and a\r\ngeneral sense of comfort and satisfaction such as had been unknown\r\nin the previous history of the country. His Chief Secretary, Forster,\r\nhowever, had not been long in Ireland before he realized that this\r\nwas the dream of a madman; and that the Government must either act or\r\nabdicate in favour of anarchy; but the Cabinet refused to support him.\r\nBefore the end of the year the Government had practically abdicated,\r\nand the rule of the Land League was the only form of Government in\r\nforce in a large part of the country. The name of the unfortunate\r\nCaptain Boycott will be for ever associated with the means the League\r\nemployed to enforce their orders. What those means were, was explained\r\nby Gladstone himself:--\r\n\r\n    \"What is meant by boycotting? In the first place it is\r\n    combined intimidation. In the second place, it is combined\r\n    intimidation made use of for the purpose of destroying the\r\n    private liberties of choice by fear of ruin and starvation. In\r\n    the third place, that which stands in the rear of boycotting\r\n    and by which alone boycotting can in the long run be made\r\n    thoroughly effective is the murder which is not to be\r\n    denounced.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a few years later--1886--the Official Report of the Cowper\r\nCommission stated it more fully:--\r\n\r\n    \"The people are more afraid of boycotting, which depends for\r\n    its success on the probability of outrage, than they are of\r\n    the judgments of the Courts of Justice. The unwritten law in\r\n    some districts is supreme. We deem it right to call attention\r\n    to the terrible ordeal that a boycotted person has to undergo,\r\n    which was by several witnesses graphically described during\r\n    the progress of our enquiry. The existence of a boycotted\r\n    person becomes a burden to him, as none in town or village are\r\n    allowed, under a similar penalty to themselves, to supply him\r\n    or his family with the necessaries of life. He is not allowed\r\n    to dispose of the produce of his farm. Instances have been\r\n    brought before us in which his attendance at divine service\r\n    was prohibited, in which his cattle have been, some killed,\r\n    some barbarously mutilated; in which all his servants and\r\n    labourers were ordered and obliged to leave him; in which the\r\n    most ordinary necessaries of life and even medical comforts,\r\n    had to be procured from long distances; in which no one\r\n    would attend the funeral, or dig a grave for, a member of a\r\n    boycotted person's family; and in which his children have been\r\n    forced to discontinue attendance at the National School of the\r\n    district.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the ordinary form of Government as conducted by the\r\nNationalists; and any attempt to interfere with it and to enforce the\r\nmilder laws of England, is now denounced as \"coercion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1881 Gladstone carried another and a more far-reaching Land Act. To\r\nput it shortly, it may be said that all agricultural land (except that\r\nheld by leaseholders, who were brought in under the Act of 1887)\r\nwas handed over to the occupiers for ever (with free power of sale),\r\nsubject only to the payment of rent--the rent not being that which the\r\ntenants had agreed to pay, but that which a Land Court decided to Be\r\na \"fair rent.\" This was to last for fifteen years, at the end of which\r\ntime the tenant might again claim to have a fair rent fixed, and so\r\n_ad infinitum_. The Land Court in most cases cut down the rent by\r\nabout 20 or 25 per cent.; and at the end of fifteen years did the\r\nsame again. As tithes (which had been secularized but not abolished),\r\nmortgages and family charges remained unchanged, the result was that\r\na large proportion of landlords were absolutely ruined; in very many\r\ncases those who appear as owners now have no beneficial interest in\r\ntheir estates.\r\n\r\nIn examining the Act calmly, one must observe in the first place that\r\nit was a wholesale confiscation of property. Not of course one\r\nthat involved the cruelty of confiscations of previous ages, but a\r\nconfiscation all the same. For if A. bought a farm in the Incumbered\r\nEstates Court, with a Parliamentary title, and let it to B. for twenty\r\nyears at a rent of £100; and the Act gave B. the right of occupying it\r\nfor ever subject to the payment of £50 a year, and selling it for any\r\nprice he liked, that can only mean the transfer of property from A. to\r\nB. Secondly, the Act encouraged bad farming; for a tenant knew that\r\nif his land got into a slovenly state--with drains stopped up, fences\r\nbroken down, and weeds growing everywhere--the result would be that\r\nthe rent would be reduced by the Commissioners at the end of the\r\nfifteen years; as the Commissioners did not go into the question of\r\nwhose the fault was, but merely took estimates as to what should be\r\nthe rent of the land in its actual condition. That farms were in many\r\ninstances intentionally allowed to go to decay with this object, has\r\nbeen proved; and this pressed hard on the labouring class, as less\r\nemployment was given. Thirdly, although the remission of debt may\r\nbring prosperity for a time, it may be doubted whether it will\r\npermanently benefit the country; for it will be noticed that the\r\nattempt to fix prices arbitrarily applied only to the letting and\r\nhiring and not to other transactions. To give a typical instance of\r\nwhat has occurred in many cases: a tenant held land at a rent of £1.\r\n15s. 0d. per acre; he took the landlord into Court, swore that the\r\nland could not bear such a rent, and had it reduced to £1. 5s. 0d.;\r\nthereupon he sold it for £20 an acre; and so the present occupier had\r\nto pay £1. 5s. 0d. to the nominal landlord, and the interest on the\r\npurchase-money (about £1 per acre) to a mortgagee; in fact, he has\r\nto pay a larger sum annually than any previous tenant did; and this\r\npayment is \"rent\" in the economic sense though it is paid not to a\r\nresident landlord but to a distant mortgagee. In other words, rent\r\nwas increased, and absenteeism became general. Fourthly, it sowed\r\nthe seeds for future trouble; for it was the temporary union of two\r\nantagonistic principles. On the one hand it was said that \"the man who\r\ntills the land should own it,\" and therefore rent was an unjust\r\ntax (in fact it was seriously argued that men of English and Scotch\r\ndescent who had hired farms in the nineteenth century had a moral\r\nright to keep them for ever rent free because tribal tenure had\r\nprevailed amongst the Celts who occupied the country many hundreds of\r\nyears before); on the other it was said that the land belonged to the\r\npeople of Ireland as a whole and not to any individuals. If that is\r\nso, what right has one man to a large farm when there are hundreds of\r\nothers in a neighbouring town who have no land at all? The passing of\r\nthe Land Acts of 1881 and 1887 made it inevitable that sooner or later\r\na fresh agitation would be commenced by \"landless men.\" And fifthly,\r\nwhen an excitable, uneducated people realize that lawlessness and\r\noutrages will be rewarded by an Act remitting debts and breaking\r\ncontracts, they are not likely in future to limit their operations\r\nto land, but will apply the same maxims to other contracts. The\r\ndemoralizing of character is a fact to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Act was passed; and if Gladstone really imagined that\r\nit would satisfy the Nationalist party he must have been grievously\r\ndisappointed. During 1881, 4,439 agrarian outrages were recorded. The\r\nGovernment declared the Land League to be illegal, and lodged some of\r\nthe leaders in gaol. Thereupon Ford, carrying out the plan laid down\r\nby Lalor in 1848, issued his famous \"No Rent\" proclamation. It was not\r\ngenerally acted upon; but his party continued active, and in May 1882\r\nLord Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke (the Chief and Under Secretary)\r\nwere murdered in the Phoenix Park. This led to the passing of the\r\nCrimes Prevention Act, by which the detectives were enabled to secure\r\nevidence against the conspirators, many of whom (as is usual in Irish\r\nhistory) turned Queen's evidence. The Act was worked with firmness;\r\nand outrages, which had numbered 2,507 during the first half of 1882,\r\nfell to 836 in the latter half, to 834 in 1883, and to 774 in 1884.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1885, Gladstone, expecting to return to power at\r\nthe ensuing election, besought the electors to give him a majority\r\nindependent of the Irish vote. In this he failed; and thereupon took\r\nplace the \"Great Surrender.\" He suddenly discovered that everything\r\nhe had said and done up to that time had been wrong; that boycotting,\r\nunder the name of \"exclusive dealing,\" was perfectly justifiable;\r\nthat the refusal to pay rent was just the same as a strike of workmen\r\n(ignoring the obvious facts that when workmen strike they cease both\r\nto give their labour and to receive pay, whereas the gist of the \"No\r\nRent\" movement was that tenants, whilst ceasing to pay, should retain\r\npossession of the farms they have hired; and that a strike arises from\r\na dispute between employers and employed--usually about rates of pay\r\nor length of hours; whereas Ford's edict that no rent was to be paid\r\nwas issued not in consequence of anything that individual landlords\r\nhad done, but because Gladstone had put the leaders of the Land League\r\nin gaol); that the men whom he had previously denounced as \"marching\r\nthrough rapine to the dismemberment of the Empire\" were heroes who\r\ndeserved to be placed in charge of the government of the country; and\r\nintroduced his first Home Rule Bill. Some of his followers went with\r\nhim; others refused. His life-long ally, John Bright, said: \"I cannot\r\ntrust the peace and interests of Ireland, north and south, to the\r\nIrish Parliamentary party, to whom the Government now propose to\r\nmake a general surrender. My six years' experience of them, of their\r\nlanguage in the House of Commons and their deeds in Ireland, makes it\r\nimpossible for me to consent to hand over to them the property and\r\nthe rights of five millions of the Queen's subjects, our\r\nfellow-countrymen, in Ireland. At least two millions of them are as\r\nloyal as the population of your town, and I will be no party to a\r\nmeasure which will thrust them from the generosity and justice of the\r\nUnited and Imperial Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bill was rejected; at the general election which ensued the people\r\nof England declared against the measure; Gladstone resigned, and Lord\r\nSalisbury became Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIONIST GOVERNMENT OF 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unionists, on returning to power in 1886, fully realized the\r\ndifficulty of the problem with which they were faced. The Nationalists\r\nheld a great Convention at Chicago, at which they resolved to make\r\nuse of the Land League not merely for the purpose of exterminating\r\nlandlords but as a means for promoting universal disorder and so\r\nbringing about a paralysis of the law. As J. Redmond stated at the\r\nConvention: \"I assert that the government of Ireland by England is an\r\nimpossibility, and I believe it to be our duty to make it so.\" And, as\r\nhe afterwards explained in Ireland, he considered that if the Tories\r\nwere able to carry on the government with the ordinary law, the\r\ncause of Home Rule might be set back for a generation; but if the\r\nNationalists could succeed in making such government impossible, and\r\nthe Tories were obliged to have recourse to coercion, the people\r\nof Great Britain would turn them out of office, and Gladstone would\r\nreturn to power and carry Home Rule. (This avowed determination on the\r\npart of the Nationalists to reduce the country to anarchy should be\r\nborne in mind when people now express their horror at the Ulstermen\r\nbeing guilty of such conduct as breaking the law.) With this object,\r\nthe Nationalists in 1887 organized the \"Plan of Campaign,\" which\r\nwas in fact an elaboration of the \"No Rent\" manifesto of 1881, and\r\na scheme for carrying out, step by step, the programme laid down by\r\nLalor in 1848. One of Lalor's adherents had been a young priest named\r\nCroke. By 1887 he had become Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cashel. He\r\nhad considered the \"No Rent\" manifesto inopportune; but now formally\r\nsanctioned the \"Plan of Campaign,\" and in a violent letter urged that\r\nit should be extended to a general refusal to pay taxes. The Plan\r\nwas also approved by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and the\r\nleaders of the Nationalist movement in Ireland and America, such as\r\nJ. Dillon and Ford; but Parnell seemed doubtful, and in England the\r\n_Daily News_ denounced it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Unionist Government had decided on their policy, which\r\nthey were determined to carry through. The main items of their\r\nprogramme were (1) To enforce the law; (2) To facilitate land\r\npurchase; (3) To develop the industries of the country; and (4) To\r\nextend local government. It is well to examine these in detail, so as\r\nto arrive at a just estimate of the two rival policies.\r\n\r\n(i) The Crimes Prevention Act passed by Gladstone in 1882 had lapsed,\r\nhaving been limited to a period of three years. Mr. Balfour (who had\r\nbecome Chief Secretary) was of opinion that the continual passing of\r\ntemporary measures was a mistake (as some one has said, it was like\r\na man burning his umbrella every fine day and then complaining of the\r\nexpense of buying so many new ones), as was shown by the fact that the\r\nIrish Parliament had passed fifty-four of such Acts in the seventeen\r\nyears of its independent existence. He therefore, in spite of vehement\r\nopposition from the combined forces of the English Radicals and\r\nthe Irish Nationalists, carried the Crimes Act of 1887, which was\r\na permanent measure, to be put in force in disturbed districts by\r\nproclamation when necessary. This was the famous \"Coercion Act\"\r\nwhich has been the subject of so much violent denunciation. But in\r\nconsidering the matter, one must ask, What Government has there ever\r\nbeen in the world that did not employ force in the carrying out of the\r\nlaw? It is true that in the early days of New Zealand Mr. Busby was\r\nsent out as a Commissioner with no means of enforcing his orders;\r\nbut the only result was that he was laughed at by the natives as \"a\r\nman-of-war without guns\"; and no one can say that the scheme was a\r\nsuccess. In fact, how can a law be a law unless it is enforced? The\r\nAct does not make anything a crime that was not a crime before; it\r\nmerely provides a shorter form of procedure when a district is so\r\ncompletely terrorized by an illegal association that injured persons\r\ndare not make complaints, witnesses dare not give evidence, and juries\r\ndare not convict. This, as we have seen, had been the case in parts\r\nof Ireland at the beginning of the rebellion of 1798; and the\r\nNationalists, who claimed to be the modern representatives of the\r\nrebels of that time, had succeeded in bringing about the same state of\r\nthings. In some of its most stringent provisions the Act is a copy of\r\nthe Police Act permanently in force in London; yet ordinary residents\r\nin the Metropolis do not seem to groan much under its tyranny, nor do\r\nthe Radicals propose to repeal it.\r\n\r\nAnd certainly the Act has worked satisfactorily from the point of\r\nview of those who desire to see the country in a state of peace and\r\nprosperity, though disastrously in the opinion of those who aim at\r\nmaking government impossible. Between July, 1887, when the Act came\r\ninto force, and the end of the year, 628 persons were prosecuted, of\r\nwhom 378 were convicted and 37 held to bail. In 1888 there were 1,475\r\nprosecutions, 907 convictions, and 175 persons required to find bail.\r\nBy 1891 (the last full year of Unionist Government) crime had sunk so\r\nrapidly that in that year there were only 243 persons prosecuted,\r\nof whom 105 were convicted, and 81 held to bail. In 1901 (when the\r\nUnionists were again in power) there were 29 prosecutions and 22\r\nconvictions. In 1902 there was a revival of crime; the Act was again\r\nbrought into operation, with much the same result as before--there\r\nwere 157 prosecutions, 104 convictions, and 17 persons were held to\r\nbail. In 1903 there were 3 prosecutions and 3 convictions.\r\n\r\n(2) _Land Purchase_. The Unionist Government considered that the dual\r\nownership set up by the Act of 1881 would be a constant source of\r\ntrouble, and that its working could not be for the benefit of the\r\ncountry. They believed that the best solution of the land question\r\nwould be a system of purchase whereby the occupiers would become\r\nowners. This of course was entirely opposed to the wishes of the\r\nNationalists; for if the land question was settled, the motive power\r\nwhich was to carry separation with it, would be gone.\r\n\r\nSome efforts in the direction of Land Purchase had been made in 1870\r\n(at the instance of Mr. Bright) and in 1881; but nothing was done on\r\na large scale until 1885, when the \"Ashbourne Act\" was passed;\r\nand various further steps were taken by the Unionist Government,\r\nculminating in the great \"Wyndham Act\" of 1903. By the earlier Acts,\r\n73,858 tenants became owners; by the Wyndham Act, 253,625. As the\r\ntotal number of agricultural tenants of Ireland amounted to slightly\r\nunder 600,000, it will be seen that more than half of them have now\r\npurchased their holdings. To explain the general principles of the\r\nAct, it is sufficient to say that when the landlord and tenants of\r\nan estate agree to a sale, the Government advance the money, and\r\nthe tenant purchasers undertake to repay it by annual instalments\r\nextending over a period of 68 years. As these annual payments must be\r\nless than the existing rent as fixed by the Land Court under the Act\r\nof 1881, the purchasing tenant has no ground for complaint; and though\r\nthe income of the landlord is reduced by the sale, he is freed from\r\nfurther anxiety; and besides, the Government give a bonus to the\r\nvendor from Imperial funds. It will be seen at once that the scheme\r\nwould have been impossible under Home Rule; for the English Government\r\nhad by the end of March 1911, agreed to advance the enormous sum of\r\nnearly £118,000,000; an amount which no Irish Government could have\r\nraised except at such an exorbitant rate of interest that it would\r\nhave been out of the question. On the other hand, England has become\r\nthe creditor of the new Irish landowners for this vast amount; and\r\nin the event of Separation a serious difficulty may arise as to its\r\nrepayment.\r\n\r\nIt may interest readers in the Colonies to learn that the Government\r\nthoughtfully passed a Registration of Titles Act in 1891; so that the\r\nIrish purchasers under the various Land Acts have the benefits which\r\nwere first introduced in Australia by Sir Robert Torrens.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1903 had the cordial support of a small minority of\r\nNationalists; but to the majority it was gall and wormwood. Hence Mr.\r\nBirrell, when he became Chief Secretary, threw every obstacle he could\r\ninto the way of its working; and in 1909 he passed a new measure,\r\nunder which land purchase has practically ceased.\r\n\r\n(3)_The development of the Industries of the Country_. That has of\r\ncourse taken various forms, of which only a few can be mentioned here.\r\nBy the Light Railways (for which the country has to thank Mr. Balfour\r\nhimself) remote and hitherto inaccessible districts have been brought\r\ninto touch with the rest of the world; and by an expenditure of\r\n£2,106,000 the railway mileage of Ireland has been increased from\r\n2,643 miles in 1890 to 3,391 in 1906. Then it is hardly too much to\r\nsay that the Labourers' Cottages Act, and the grants made under it,\r\nhave transformed the face of the country.\r\n\r\nBy this Act, District Councils are enabled, in localities where\r\naccommodation for labourers is insufficient, to take land compulsorily\r\nand erect cottages, the money advanced by the Government for the\r\npurpose being gradually repaid by the ratepayers. The wretched hovels\r\nwhich were the disgrace of Ireland from the dawn of history until a\r\nperiod within living memory, have almost disappeared; and comfortable,\r\nsanitary and pleasing dwellings have taken their place.\r\n\r\nEven this excellent Act, however, is now used by the Nationalists to\r\nfurther their own objects. One instance may suffice. In 1907 a farmer\r\nfell under the ban of the League and was ordered to be boycotted. The\r\nDistrict Council found that one occupant of a \"Labourer's Cottage\"\r\ndisregarded the order and continued to work for the boycotted farmer.\r\nThey promptly evicted him. What would be said in England if a Tory\r\nlandlord evicted a cottager for working for a Radical farmer?\r\n\r\nBut even more important than these measures has been the establishment\r\nof the Department of Agriculture. The success of this has been due to\r\nthe ability, energy and unselfishness of Sir Horace Plunkett. The main\r\nobject of the Department was to instruct the farming classes in the\r\nmost effective methods of agriculture and the industries connected\r\nwith it. This by itself would have been a great work; but Sir Horace\r\nhas also founded the Irish Agricultural Organization Society, to\r\nencourage co-operative organization amongst farmers, based on\r\nthe principle of mutual help; and the success of this, worked in\r\nconjunction with the Department, has been marvellous. More than nine\r\nhundred local societies have been established, for the promotion of\r\nindustries such as dairying and poultry farming; co-operative credit\r\nbanks have been formed, based on what is known in Germany as the\r\nRaffeisen system. The turnover of these societies in 1908 amounted\r\nto more than £2,250,000. Agricultural Organization Societies, in\r\nimitation of the Irish one, have been formed in England and Scotland;\r\nand so far did its fame reach that the Americans sent over an agent to\r\nenquire into its working.\r\n\r\nOf course it is unfair to attribute the prosperity or the decline of\r\na country to any one measure; and more than that, it is only by taking\r\ninto consideration a number of circumstances and a long term of years\r\nthat we can decide whether prosperity is real or merely transitory.\r\nBut that Ireland increased in prosperity under the influence of\r\nthe Unionist Government, cannot be denied; indeed Mr. Redmond, when\r\nshepherding the Eighty Club (an English Radical Society) through\r\nIreland in 1911, did not deny the prosperity of the country, and could\r\nonly suggest that the same reforms would have been introduced and\r\nbetter carried out under an Irish Parliament--regardless of the facts\r\nthat no Nationalist Government could have found the money for\r\nthem; and that Nationalists are orators and politicians, not men\r\nof business. The combined value of exports and imports rose from\r\n104,000,000 in 1904 to 125,000,000 in 1909; and the gross receipts on\r\nrailways from £4,140,000 to £11,335,000. The deposits in savings banks\r\nrose from £3,128,000 in 1888 to £10,627,000 in 1908. The tonnage\r\nof shipping in Irish ports was 11,560,000 in 1900; in 1910 it was\r\n13,475,000.\r\n\r\nSir Horace had done his utmost to prevent the curse of political\r\nstrife from entering into his agricultural projects. He had been\r\ncareful to appoint Nationalists to some of the most important offices\r\nin his Department, and to show no more favour to one part of the\r\ncountry than another. But all in vain; the National League, when their\r\nfriends returned to power, at once resolved to undo his labours, some\r\nof them openly saying that the increased attention devoted to\r\ntrade and agriculture was turning men's thoughts away from the more\r\nimportant work of political agitation. Mr. T.W. Russell, a man totally\r\nignorant of agricultural affairs, whose only claim to the office was\r\nthat he was a convert to Nationalism, was appointed in place of\r\nSir Horace. He promptly declined to continue to the Agricultural\r\nOrganization Society the support which it had previously received\r\nfrom the Department; and, with the aid of the United Irish League,\r\nsucceeded in preventing the Society from receiving a grant from the\r\nBoard of Agriculture similar to those given to the English and Scotch\r\nsocieties; threw discredit on the Co-operative Credit Banks, and\r\ndenounced the Co-operative Farming Societies as injurious to local\r\nshopkeepers. And thus he made it clear that it is impossible in\r\nIreland to conduct even such a business as the development of\r\nagriculture without stirring up political bitterness.\r\n\r\nAnother effort of Mr. Balfour's--the establishment of the Congested\r\nDistricts Board--has had a strange and instructive history. It was\r\nestablished in 1891. Mr. Balfour decided to entrust to a small body of\r\nIrishmen, selected irrespective of party considerations, the task of\r\nmaking an experiment as to what could be done to relieve the poorest\r\nparts of Ireland; and with this object, the Board, though endowed with\r\nonly small funds, were given the widest powers over the area within\r\nwhich they were to operate. They were empowered to take such steps as\r\nthey thought proper for (1) Aiding migration or emigration from the\r\ncongested districts, and settling the migrant or emigrant in his\r\nnew home; and (2) Aiding and developing agriculture, forestry,\r\nand breeding of live stock and poultry, weaving, spinning, fishing\r\n(including the construction of piers and harbours, and supplying\r\nfishing boats and gear and industries subservient to and connected\r\nwith fishing), and any other suitable industries. Both the powers and\r\nthe revenues of the Board were increased from time to time, until by\r\n1909 its annual expenditure amounted to nearly £250,000. It became\r\nclear almost at the beginning of its labours that amongst the many\r\ndifficulties which the Board would have to face there were two\r\npre-eminent ones; if it was desired to enlarge uneconomic holdings by\r\nremoving a part of the population to other districts, the people to be\r\nremoved might not wish to go; and the landless men in the district to\r\nwhich they were to be removed might say that they had a better right\r\nto the land than strangers from a distance, and the result might be a\r\nfree fight. As the only chance of success for the labours of the Board\r\nwas the elimination of party politics, Mr. J. Morley, on becoming\r\nChief Secretary in the Gladstonian Government of 1892, appointed as\r\nCommissioners Bishop O'Donnell of Raphoe (the Patron of the Ancient\r\nOrder of Hibernians, and a Trustee of the Parliamentary Fund of the\r\nUnited Irish League); and the Rev. D. O'Hara, a leading Clerical\r\nNationalist of a violent type. It is needless to say that under their\r\ninfluence the action of the Board has been conducted on strictly\r\nNationalist lines. One instance may suffice. In 1900, the Board,\r\nhaving come into the possession of the Dillon estate, wished to sell\r\nit to the tenants; and when doing so, considering the sporting rights\r\nto be a valuable asset, decided to reserve them. A considerable number\r\nof the tenants expressed their readiness to purchase their holdings\r\nsubject to the reservation. The Board received an offer of £11,000\r\nfor the mansion, demesne and sporting rights over the estate. The\r\nreservation of sporting rights when, taking the whole estate, they\r\nwere of pecuniary value, had been the common practice of the Board in\r\nother sales; but an agitation was at once got up (not by the tenants)\r\nagainst the reservation in this case, on the ground that it was not\r\nright for the Board to place any burden on the fee simple of the\r\nholdings; the offer of £11,000 was refused, and soon afterwards the\r\nBoard sold the mansion and the best part of the demesne to a community\r\nof Belgian nuns for £2,100. The sporting rights, which became the\r\nproperty of the purchasing tenants, ceased to be of any appreciable\r\npecuniary value, though in a few cases the tenants succeeded in\r\nselling their share of them for small sums to local agitators. When a\r\nwitness before the Royal Commission of 1906 ventured to point out that\r\nthe taxpayers thus lost £8,900 by the transaction, he was severely\r\nrebuked by the Clerical members of the Commission for suggesting\r\nthat the presence of the Belgian nuns was not a great benefit to the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThis Royal Commission was appointed ostensibly for the purpose of\r\nenquiring into and reporting upon the operations of the Board since\r\nits foundation. After going through a mass of evidence, the Chairman\r\n(Lord Dudley) said that the Board had tried for twenty years to\r\ndevelop new industries and had failed; and another member (Lord\r\nMacDonnell) said that it had only touched the fringe of the question;\r\nand, considering that in spite of all its efforts at promoting local\r\nindustries, emigration continued to be greater from the district\r\nsubject to its control than from any other part of Ireland, it is hard\r\nto see what other view was possible. But the large majority of the\r\nCommission were ardent Nationalists--in fact, one of them a short time\r\nbefore his appointment had publicly advocated an absolute, rigorous,\r\ncomplete and exhaustive system of boycotting; and the witness who\r\nspoke for the United Irish League told the Commission that it was the\r\nstrong view of the League that the Board should be preserved. It was\r\nonly natural therefore that the Commission should report that in their\r\nopinion the powers and scope of its operations should be extended and\r\nits income largely increased. This was accordingly done by the Birrell\r\nAct of 1909. One of the most important functions of the Board was\r\nthe purchase of land, for which they possessed compulsory powers. The\r\nwitness who had appeared before the Commission as representing the\r\nUnited Irish League was Mr. FitzGibbon, Chairman of the Roscommon\r\nCounty Council, and now a Member of Parliament. He had previously been\r\nsent to prison for inciting to the Plan of Campaign, and for criminal\r\nconspiracy. He had also taken a leading part in the cattle-driving\r\nagitation (to which I shall refer later) and had announced that his\r\npolicy was \"to enable the Board to get land at fag-end prices.\" He\r\nwas therefore appointed by Mr. Birrell to be a member of the Board, as\r\nbeing a suitable person to decide what compensation should be paid\r\nfor land taken compulsorily. He publicly stated that his object was to\r\ncarry out the great work of Michael Davitt. And he certainly has been\r\nactive in doing so; and now the agitators, when they want to have an\r\nestate transferred to the Board, commence by preventing its being\r\nlet or used, and so compelling the owner to leave it derelict\r\nand unprofitable; then, when by every description of villainy and\r\nboycotting it has been rendered almost worthless, the Congested\r\nDistricts Board (who have carefully lain by until then) step in with\r\na preposterous offer which the unfortunate owner has no choice but\r\nto accept. This may appear strong language to use with reference to\r\na Government Department presided over by Roman Catholic bishops and\r\npriests; but the words are not mine; they are taken from the judgment\r\nof Mr. Justice Ross, in the case of the Browne Estate.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, whatever else the Congested Districts Board may have\r\nachieved, they have done one good thing; they have shown to Unionists\r\nin Ireland what the principles of justice are by which the Nationalist\r\nGovernment will be conducted.\r\n\r\n(4) The fourth division of the Unionist policy was the extension of\r\nlocal government. By the Act of 1898 County and District Councils were\r\nformed, like those which had been existing in England for a few\r\nyears previously; and the powers of the old Grand Juries (who it\r\nwas admitted had done their work well, but were now objected to on\r\nprinciple as not being elected bodies) were abolished. The importance\r\nof the measure can hardly be overestimated; for not only did it\r\nre-organize local government on what would elsewhere be a democratic\r\nbut is in Ireland a Clerical basis; but also it may be described as\r\nHome Rule on a small scale. By examining into the practical working of\r\nthe scheme we may form an idea as to what Home Rule is likely to be;\r\nand both parties refer to it as a ground for their opinion. It is\r\ncurious now to note that it was Gerald Balfour, the Unionist Chief\r\nSecretary, who, when introducing the measure, appealed to the Irish\r\ngentry not to stand aloof from the new order of things, but to seek\r\nfrom the suffrages of their fellow-citizens that position which no\r\nothers were so well qualified to fill as themselves--in much the same\r\nway that English Radical orators now accuse the Ulstermen of want\r\nof patriotism when they declare that they will never take part in a\r\nNationalist Government. The Nationalists were of course loud in their\r\nprotestations that in the noble work of local government all narrow\r\npolitical and sectarian bitterness would be put aside, and all\r\nIrishmen irrespective of creed, class or party would be welcome to\r\ntake part--just as they are now when they promise the same about the\r\nNational Parliament. Thus J. Redmond said:\r\n\r\n    \"No man's politics or religion will be allowed to be a bar\r\n    to him if he desires to serve his country on one of the\r\n    new bodies. Men of different creeds, who have had an almost\r\n    impassable gulf between them all their lives, will be brought\r\n    together for the first time in the working of this scheme of\r\n    Local Government.... On every one of the juries in Ireland\r\n    there have been county gentlemen who have shown the greatest\r\n    aptitude for business, the greatest industry, and the greatest\r\n    ability; and I say it would be a monstrous thing if, by\r\n    working the election of these County Councils on narrow\r\n    sectarian or political lines, men of that class were excluded\r\n    from the service of their country.\"\r\n\r\nAnd another Nationalist Member added: \"We are anxious for the\r\nco-operation of those who have leisure, wealth and knowledge.\" Irish\r\nUnionists who refused to believe these assurances were denounced by\r\nNationalists as bigots and humbugs. The value of the assurances of\r\n1912 may be gauged by the manner in which those of 1898 have been\r\nfulfilled. At the election of 1899 a few Protestants and Unionists\r\nwere returned. But the general feeling of the newly-formed Councils\r\nmay be gathered from the following resolution which was passed by the\r\nMayo County Council in that year:\r\n\r\n    \"That we, the members of the Mayo County Council, congratulate\r\n    the gallant Boers on their brilliant defeats of the troops\r\n    of the pirate Saxon. That we hope that a just Providence will\r\n    strengthen the arms of these farmer fighters in their brave\r\n    struggle for their independence. And we trust that as Babylon\r\n    fell, and as Rome fell, so also may fall the race and nation\r\n    whose creed is the creed of greed, and whose god is the god of\r\n    Mammon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by 1902, when the next triennial elections were coming on,\r\nthe mask was thrown off. The _Freeman's Journal_ (the principal\r\nNationalist organ) said:--\r\n\r\n    \"In every County or District Council where a landlord, however\r\n    amiable, or personally estimable, offers himself for election,\r\n    the answer of the majority must be the same: 'No admittance\r\n    here.'\"\r\nAnd J. Redmond stated the case still more plainly:\r\n\r\n    \"We have in our hands a weapon recently won, the full force\r\n    of which is not yet, I believe, thoroughly understood by\r\n    the English Government or by ourselves. I mean the weapon\r\n    of freely-elected County Councils and District Councils who\r\n    to-day form a network of National organizations all over\r\n    Ireland, and who to-morrow, I doubt not, if the other\r\n    organizations were struck, would be willing to come forward\r\n    and take their place, and, in their Council Chambers, carry on\r\n    the National work.\"\r\n\r\nPledges in the following form were presented for signature to all\r\ncandidates by the United Irish League (except of course in north-east\r\nUlster):--\r\n\r\n    \"I ---- hereby pledge myself, if elected to represent the ----\r\n    Division on the County Council, to promote the interests of\r\n    the United Irish League, and to resign my position whenever\r\n    called upon to do so by the ---- Divisional Executive.\"\r\n\r\nSo completely has the policy been carried out that by 1911, to\r\nquote the words of Mr. FitzGibbon, M.P. (to whom I have previously\r\nreferred):--\r\n\r\n    \"There was not a landlord in the country who could get his\r\n    agent returned as District Councillor or County Councillor,\r\n    or even his eldest son or himself. The Organization had\r\n    emancipated the people; it had given them the power which\r\n    their enemies had wielded; it had cleared the road for\r\n    Ireland's freedom.\"\r\n\r\nAt present Unionists and Nationalists are pretty evenly divided in the\r\nCounty Councils of Ulster; in the other three Provinces amongst 703\r\nCounty Councillors there are only fifteen Unionists. In other words,\r\nthe Act has enabled the Nationalist party to carry out the plan laid\r\ndown by Lalor of taking quiet and peaceable possession of all\r\nthe rights and powers of government, as a stepping-stone towards\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nOf course it may be said with much truth that if the large majority of\r\nthe people are Nationalists they are perfectly justified in choosing\r\nNationalists as their representatives. But that is not the point. The\r\nreal point is that in spite of the protestations of the Nationalists\r\nat the time of the passing of the Act, politics in their bitterest\r\nform have been brought in, and the Unionist minority have been\r\ndeprived of all share in the local government of the country.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this still further, I may add that a General Council\r\nof County Councils was formed in 1900, for the purpose of promoting a\r\nfair and equitable administration of the Act. In order that the Ulster\r\nCouncils might unite with the others, it was agreed that politics\r\nshould be excluded. But after the election of 1902, that agreement\r\nwas abandoned; and, rather than take part in what had become a mere\r\npolitical gathering, the Ulster representatives withdrew. Left\r\nto themselves, the Nationalist General Council in 1906 passed the\r\nfollowing resolution:--\r\n\r\n    \"That the Irish people are a free people, with a natural right\r\n    to govern themselves; that no Parliament is competent to make\r\n    such laws for Ireland except an Irish Parliament, sitting in\r\n    Dublin; and that the claim by other bodies of men to make laws\r\n    for us to govern Ireland is illegal, unconstitutional, and at\r\n    variance with the rights of the people.\"\r\n\r\nIf such a body as the General Council of County Councils pass a\r\nresolution like this, is there much probability that the Nationalist\r\nParliament will refrain from doing the same, should the Imperial\r\nParliament attempt to exercise the power given to it by the present\r\nBill, and to legislate for Ireland?\r\n\r\nBut again it may be said that though the Councils have thus become\r\npolitical bodies, they have conducted their business so admirably\r\nthat their conduct is a powerful argument to show that a Nationalist\r\nParliament will be equally practical and liberal. This is the view put\r\nforward by Nationalist orators and their humble follower Mr. Birrell,\r\nwho in November 1911, informed his friends at Bristol that the Irish\r\nhad shown a great capacity for local government and that from what\r\npeople who had seen a great deal of the south and west of Ireland told\r\nhim there was no fear of persecution or oppression by the Catholic\r\nmajority of their Protestant fellow-subjects. In support of this,\r\nvarious facts are adduced, which it is well to examine in detail,\r\nremembering the poet's words that\r\n\r\n    \"A lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest powers possessed by the County Councils is the\r\nexercise of patronage. It would probably be generally admitted in any\r\ncountry but Ireland that there, if anywhere, religion and politics\r\nshould be excluded, and men selected only for their qualifications.\r\nThe Nationalists, wishing to demonstrate the fairness of the Councils\r\nwhich hold their views, contrast the bigotry shown by the Unionist\r\nCorporation of Belfast with the liberality of similar bodies in other\r\nparts of the country. And certainly the figures they adduce, when\r\naddressing audiences in England or writing for English readers, are\r\nvery striking. Thus Mr. Birrell said at Skipton in November 1911 that\r\nhe had been told that in the great Unionist City of Belfast there was\r\nonly one Roman Catholic in the employment of the Corporation, and he\r\nwas a scavenger. (It will be observed that here, as in many of his\r\nspeeches, he carefully used the expression \"he had been told\"--so\r\nthat what he said may be literally true, even though when he heard the\r\nstatement he knew that it was false.) And Stephen Gwynn, M.P., in his\r\n\"Case for Home Rule,\" says: \"In Belfast, Catholics are a third of the\r\npopulation; but the Corporation pays £51,405 in a year in salaries,\r\nof which only £640 goes to Catholics.\" And about the same time as\r\nMr. Birrell's oration, Mr. Redmond, speaking at Swindon, said that in\r\nGalway, Cork, Westmeath and King's County (where Roman Catholics form\r\nthe large majority of the population) Protestants held 23 per cent. of\r\nthe salaried appointments in the gift of the Councils.\r\n\r\nBut when we descend from the airy height of Nationalist rhetoric to\r\nthe prosaic region of fact, we find that the rates of the City\r\nof Belfast amount to about £342,000; of this sum, Roman Catholic\r\nratepayers pay less than £18,000. There are nine hundred Roman\r\nCatholics in the employment of the Corporation, and they receive in\r\nsalaries about £48,000 per annum. And as to the figures quoted by Mr.\r\nRedmond, we find that he omitted to state that not one of the 23 per\r\ncent. had been appointed by a County Council; they were all survivals\r\nof the system in force before 1899, whose positions were secured by\r\nstatute; and in not one of the counties he mentioned has a Unionist\r\nbeen appointed to any salaried office since that date. To take the\r\nCounty of Cork as a specimen; there are ninety-four salaried\r\noffices in the gift of the County Council; of these nine are held\r\nby Protestants--but they were all appointed before 1899. Of the\r\nthirty-three salaried offices in the gift of the City Corporation, two\r\nare held by Protestants--but these also were appointed before 1898;\r\nand yet the Protestants pay nearly half the rates. And in Ireland\r\nthere is not the slightest attempt at concealment in the matter;\r\nthus in one case a District Council adopted by formal resolution the\r\nrequest of the local priests not to support any candidate who did\r\nnot produce a testimonial from the parish priest; as a Councillor\r\nremarked, it was the simplest way of stating that no Protestant need\r\napply.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the appointment of medical officers (\"dispensary doctors\"\r\nas they are technically called in Ireland) that the policy of the\r\nNationalists has been most marked. Many years ago, the late Cardinal\r\nCullen ruled that it was a mortal sin to vote for a heretic for such\r\nan office; now, however, the bishops have gone further. There are\r\nthree medical schools in Dublin--Trinity College, the College of\r\nSurgeons, and the Catholic University School; and three in the\r\nprovinces--at Belfast, Cork and Galway. The Medical School of Trinity\r\nCollege has a world-wide reputation. The students are required to\r\ncomplete their Arts course before specializing in medicine (thus\r\nensuring that they shall be men of general culture and not merely of\r\nprofessional training); the professors and lecturers are amongst the\r\nablest men of the day; the students have the advantage of the large\r\ncity hospitals for their clinical studies; and the standard required\r\nfor a degree is high. And not only is Trinity College open to all\r\nstudents without distinction of creed, but the College authorities\r\nhave frequently offered a site within their grounds for a Roman\r\nCatholic Chapel and the salary of a Chaplain who would take spiritual\r\ncare of his flock. Nevertheless the Roman Catholic bishops have\r\nordered that no candidate who has been trained at any College except\r\nthe Catholic University school shall be eligible for the post of\r\nDispensary Doctor; and when an election takes place (as for instance\r\nthat at Kiltimagh in 1905) the question of professional qualification\r\nis not taken into consideration--having been trained at a \"godless\r\ncollege\" is a fatal bar to any candidate, however able. In the\r\nKiltimagh case, the resolution passed shortly after the election by\r\nthe local branch of the United Irish League is instructive reading:--\r\n\r\n    \"That we, the members of the Kiltimagh Branch of the United\r\n    Irish League, take advantage of this our first meeting since\r\n    the important Election of Medical Officer for the Kiltimagh\r\n    Dispensary District, to express our appreciation of all the\r\n    Guardians for the several divisions in this parish for the\r\n    faithful honesty with which they represented us on that\r\n    occasion. We feel proud to know that not one of our\r\n    representatives voted for a Queen's College man against a\r\n    Catholic University man. They voted for a man who is the\r\n    stamp of man we want--a sound Catholic, a sound Nationalist, a\r\n    Gaelic Leaguer, and a highly qualified medical man. We believe\r\n    their action will meet with the approval of the Bishops and\r\n    Priests of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nTo one who lives in Ireland it is sad enough to see year by year the\r\nmost able and promising of the medical students being driven out\r\nof the country on account of their religion, and forced to look for\r\nopenings elsewhere; but to a thoughtful observer it is even worse than\r\nthat; it is the beginning of the new Penal Laws.\r\n\r\nAnd when we turn to other matters, where the marvellous efficiency of\r\nthe County Councils exists, is hard for an unprejudiced enquirer\r\nto find. The old Grand Juries handed over the roads and bridges in\r\nexcellent order; they are certainly not better now, and in many cases\r\nworse. In fact, one English theoretical Radical who paid a brief visit\r\nto Ireland, inhaled so much Hibernian logic during his hurried tour\r\nthat he solemnly argued that the badness of the roads proved that the\r\nCouncils had been governing too economically; and therefore what was\r\nneeded was a central body--that is, an Irish Parliament--to stir up\r\nthe local administration! Nationalist writers claim that the rates\r\nare going down; but that merely means that they are not so high now as\r\nthey were soon after the Act came into force, not that they are lower\r\nthan before 1898. It was expected that the rates would be reduced by\r\nthe operation of the Old Age Pensions Act; but that has not proved to\r\nbe the case. And the increase in local indebtedness is alarming.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, therefore, I trust that I have, even in this brief sketch,\r\nmade it clear that the policy of the Unionist Government, taken as\r\na whole, has been of immense benefit to the social and material\r\nprosperity of Ireland; and that the points in which it has failed\r\nhave been those where their reforms have fallen under the power of the\r\nNationalists, who have either thwarted them, or made use of them\r\nto further their own ideas. I shall next proceed to examine the\r\nalternative policy, which is being carried out by the present\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE GLADSTONIAN GOVERNMENT OF 1892. THE POLITICAL SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Gladstone-Rosebery Government--from 1892 to 1895--matters\r\nin Ireland were quiet. The Nationalists were at first on their best\r\nbehaviour, in consequence of the promised introduction of the Home\r\nRule Bill; and after its rejection by the Upper House, the time was\r\ntoo short for anything serious to happen. But the period was marked by\r\nthe commencement of one great change in Irish administration. It must\r\nbe admitted by impartial observers that the old landlord party,\r\nwith all their faults, made as a rule excellent magistrates. A large\r\nproportion of them were retired military officers, who had gained some\r\nexperience in duties of the sort in their regiments; others were men\r\nof superior education, who studied with care the laws they were to\r\nadminister. Living in the locality, they knew the habits and feelings\r\nof the people; and yet they were sufficiently separated from them to\r\nbe able to act as impartial judges; and no charges of bribery were\r\never made against them. And, the work being congenial, they gladly\r\ndevoted their spare time to it. Gladstone's Chief Secretary (the\r\npresent Lord Morley) determined to alter all this; he accordingly\r\nappointed to the Bench a large number of men drawn from a lower social\r\nstratum, less educated and intelligent than those previously chosen,\r\nbut more likely to administer \"Justice according to Irish ideas.\"\r\nThen the operation of the Local Government Act, by which Chairmen of\r\nCouncils (all of course Nationalists) became _ex officio_ magistrates,\r\ncompleted a social revolution by entirely altering the character of\r\nthe Bench. In some localities the magistrates previously appointed\r\nrealizing that, being now in a minority, they could be of no further\r\nuse on the Bench, withdrew; in others, though the old magistrates\r\ncontinued to sit, they found themselves persistently outvoted on every\r\npoint; so what good they have done by remaining, it is hard to see.\r\nAmongst the men appointed under the new system, there have been\r\nseveral instances of justices who have continued to act without the\r\nslightest shame or scruple although they have been convicted of such\r\noffences as drunkenness, selling drink on unlicensed premises, or\r\ncorrupt practices at elections. But worse than that: the new order\r\nof justices do not regard their duties as magisterial, but political;\r\nthey give but little attention to ordinary cases, but attend in\r\nfull strength to prevent the conviction of any person for an outrage\r\norganized by the United Irish League; and do not hesitate to promise\r\nbeforehand that they will do so. If by any chance a sufficient number\r\nare not present to carry their purpose, the names of the absentees are\r\npublished in the Black List of the League--and the result of that is\r\nso well known that they are not likely to offend again. Hence comes\r\nthe contemptible exhibition--now not infrequent--of men being charged\r\nbefore the Bench, and no evidence being offered for the defence;\r\nyet the Stipendiary Magistrate being obliged to say that though he\r\nconsiders the case proved, the majority of the Bench have decided to\r\nrefuse informations. Even a Roman Catholic Bishop has confessed that\r\nnow magistrates too often have no respect for their obligations to\r\ndispense the law justly and without favour; and that the Bench is\r\nsometimes so \"packed\" that the culprits, though guilty, are certain to\r\nbe acquitted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the policy of the present Government since it\r\ncame into power in 1906, it is well to explain what the principal\r\nsocieties--secret or other--are which now conduct the Government of\r\nIreland. In one sense indeed the names are immaterial; for, as in\r\n1798, in whatever various ways the societies have commenced, they are\r\nall working towards the same end, and being controlled by the same\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe Land League, which was founded in 1879 as a league for ruining\r\nlandlords as a stepping-stone towards independence, having been\r\nsuppressed by Gladstone in 1881, was reformed under the name of the\r\nIrish National League. This was in its turn suppressed in 1887, and in\r\n1898 appeared once more under the name of the United Irish League\r\nwith J. Redmond as President and J. Devlin as Secretary. In 1901 Mr.\r\nRedmond explained the objects of the League as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"The United Irish League is not merely an agrarian movement.\r\n    It is first, last, and all the time a National movement;\r\n    and those of us who are endeavouring to rouse the farmers of\r\n    Ireland, as we endeavoured twenty years ago in the days of the\r\n    Land League, to rouse them, are doing so, not merely to obtain\r\n    the removal of their particular grievances, but because we\r\n    believe by rousing them we will be strengthening the National\r\n    movement and helping us to obtain our end, which is, after\r\n    all, National independence of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to make the exact meaning of the phrase \"National Independence of\r\nIreland\" quite clear, he soon afterwards stated that their object was\r\nthe same as that aimed at by Emmett and Wolfe Tone--in other words, to\r\nplace Ireland in the scale of nations with a constitution resembling\r\nthat of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy March 1908 (that is, about two years after the present Government\r\ncame into power), to quote the words of Mr. Justice Wright, \"the only\r\nlaw feared and obeyed was the law not of the land but of the United\r\nIrish League\"; and before the end of that year Mr. Redmond was able to\r\nreport to his friends in America:--\r\n\r\n    \"We have in Ireland an organization which is practically\r\n    a government of the country. There is in O'Connell Street,\r\n    Dublin, a great office managed by the real Chief Secretary for\r\n    Ireland, J. Devlin, the Member for Belfast.\"\r\n\r\nThe organization of the League is admirable. The country is covered\r\nwith a network of branches, to which people in the district are\r\nobliged to contribute under penalty of being boycotted; these branches\r\nare united under provincial executives, whilst the Directory in\r\nDublin controls the whole. The union between the League and the Roman\r\nCatholic Church is as complete as the union between that Church and\r\nsome societies started on a non-sectarian basis became during the\r\nrebellion of 1798; as we have seen, a bishop is one of the trustees,\r\nand other bishops are amongst the subscribers; the Sunday meetings of\r\nthe various branches, at which boycotting and other measures of the\r\nkind are arranged, are usually presided over by the parish priests. On\r\nthe other hand, few laymen, whatever their religion may be, who have\r\nany stake in the country, can be got to join the League; in the words\r\nof A.J. Kettle, M.P.:--\r\n\r\n    \"On its roll of membership there are no landlords or\r\n    ex-landlords, few merchants, fewer Irish manufacturers. There\r\n    are few of the men who are managing the business of Ireland\r\n    in city or town, connected with the League. The bankers who\r\n    regulate our finances, the railway or transit men who control\r\n    our trade, internal and external, even the leading cattle men\r\n    who handle most of our animal produce, are not to be found in\r\n    its ranks.\"\r\n\r\nIn further evidence of this it may be noted that in spite of all the\r\nefforts of the League at collecting money, the subscriptions to the\r\nIrish Parliamentary Fund do not amount to a halfpenny per head of the\r\npopulation; as J. Dillon has remarked: \"The National cause in Ireland\r\ncould not live for six months if it were deprived of the support of\r\nthe Irish across the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the League is the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a\r\nsecret political and exclusively Roman Catholic association, of which\r\nJ. Devlin, M.P. (the Secretary of the League), is President. It is\r\nalso called the Board of Erin, to distinguish it from the American\r\nbranch. The American branch, I may remark, is also known as the Molly\r\nMaguires, as it was under that name that it conducted the series of\r\nmurders and outrages at the Pennsylvanian mines thirty years ago.\r\nHence the Irish branch is sometimes nicknamed the \"Molly Maguires.\"\r\nThe Order is very religious, in the sense that part of its programme\r\nis to deprive heretics of every means of earning their livelihood; as\r\na Nationalist who did not sympathize with the operations of the Order\r\nexpressed it: \"If Protestants are to be robbed of their business, if\r\nthey are to be deprived of public contracts, and shut out of every\r\noffice and emolument,--what is that but extermination?\" The political\r\nprinciples of the Order can be gathered from the Address presented by\r\nthem to Captain Condon on the occasion of his visit to Dublin in 1909.\r\nCaptain Condon, I may explain, had been a prominent Fenian and member\r\nof the Irish Republican brotherhood, and had taken part in the riot at\r\nManchester in 1867 which resulted in the murder of Sergeant Brett; he\r\nnow resides in America. In 1909 he visited Ireland on the invitation\r\nof J. Redmond; and the address presented to him by the Ancient Order\r\nof Hibernians contained the following words:--\r\n\r\n    \"In you, O'Meagher Condon, we recognize one of those\r\n    connecting links with the past which all nations cherish,\r\n    and you are ready to-day with voice and pen to give your\r\n    unflagging support to Ireland's leaders with as much\r\n    enthusiasm as you grasped the sword to lead Ireland in the\r\n    dark but historic '67. We are sure it will interest you to\r\n    know that the ranks of the Hibernians to-day are composed\r\n    of the men and children of those who swore allegiance to the\r\n    Irish Republic with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Order has lately acquired additional strength by becoming an\r\n\"Approved Society\" under the Insurance Act of 1911. In Ireland it is\r\nno more possible for life insurance than for anything else to exist\r\nwithout being dragged into the vortex of religious and political\r\nquarrels.\r\n\r\nThe \"Clan-na-gael\"--that is, the Dynamite Club--still flourishes\r\nin America; but for obvious reasons it does not make any public\r\nappearance in Ireland; and the exact part which it takes in the\r\nmovement at the present time, it is impossible to say.\r\n\r\n\"Sinn Fein\" (which means \"Ourselves\") is another Separatist\r\nAssociation, aiming at the establishment of Ireland as a Sovereign\r\nState, and teaching that the election of Irishmen to serve in the\r\nBritish Parliament is treason to the Irish State. As its name implies,\r\nit desires to make use of the revival of the Irish language as a means\r\ntowards the end for which it is working. It was founded in 1905.\r\nWhy this Society and the United Irish League, whose objects seem\r\nidentical, should be ready to fly at one another's throats, is one of\r\nthe things that those who are outside the Nationalist circle cannot\r\nunderstand. But the Clerical leaders, who do their utmost to further\r\nthe operations of the League, look askance at Sinn Fein; its ultimate\r\nsuccess therefore is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nThen, working in conjunction with these societies is the \"Gaelic\r\nLeague,\" founded for the \"de-Anglicizing\" of Ireland, as helping\r\ntowards separation. As J. Sweetman (who, besides being a prominent\r\nmember of the Gaelic League, is also Vice-President of Sinn Fein and\r\nVice-Chairman of the Central Council of Irish County Councils and may\r\ntherefore be regarded as speaking with authority) has expressed it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Out of the Gaelic League's de-Anglicizing propaganda\r\n    have already grown a series of movements not only strongly\r\n    political but each and all making for a separate independent\r\n    Irish nation, freed from every link of the British\r\n    connection.\"\r\n\r\nWere it not for its political object, the folly of this \"revival of\r\nthe Irish language\" would be past belief. The language of Shakespeare\r\nand Milton, of Gibbon and Macaulay, ought surely to be good enough for\r\nordinary people; and it must be obvious to every reasoning being that\r\nat the present moment of the world's history, English is one of the\r\nmost useful languages in existence. It is spoken by 40,000,000 of\r\npeople in Europe and twice that number in America, not to mention\r\nAustralasia and South Africa. It is the language of commerce, of\r\nscience, and of a vast amount of literature. Europeans of various\r\nnationalities learn it, for the sake of its convenience; although, as\r\nwe all know, one of the difficulties of modern life is that boys and\r\ngirls have too much to study; educationalists everywhere complain\r\nthat the curriculum is overloaded. Its position in Ireland can be\r\nseen exactly by the census returns; for the papers contain a \"language\r\ncolumn,\" each person being required to state whether he speaks\r\nEnglish or Irish or both. According to the returns of 1891, the total\r\npopulation was in round numbers 4,725,000; of whom 4,037,000 spoke\r\nEnglish only, 643,000 both languages, and 44,000 Irish only. And that\r\ntrifling minority existed only in certain localities, and was confined\r\nto the less educated classes. The only counties in which a majority of\r\nthe population spoke Irish (including those who spoke both languages)\r\nwere Mayo and Galway. Yet now it is solemnly said that Ireland,\r\nbeing an independent nation, must have a language of its own; even in\r\ncounties where no language but English has been spoken for centuries,\r\nand where probably none of the ancestors of the present population\r\never spoke any other language, Irish is being taught in the Roman\r\nCatholic primary schools, and the unhappy children who might be\r\nstudying arithmetic or elementary geography, are wasting their time\r\nover a totally useless language. I say \"totally useless\" deliberately;\r\nfor the arguments usually brought forward in favour of the study,\r\napart from the political one--that Irish is of use in the study of\r\nphilology, and that the MSS. of centuries ago contain fine specimens\r\nof poetry--are too absurd to be worth discussing. The real object of\r\nthe Nationalists in \"encouraging the revival of the Irish language\"\r\nis clearly set out in the following words of T. MacSeamus in a recent\r\nnumber of the _Irish Review_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Most important of all, the Irish language is one of the\r\n    things that distinguish us from England. It is a mark of that\r\n    separateness which it is the business of every Nationalist to\r\n    maintain and emphasise on every possible occasion. It is one\r\n    of the signs--perhaps the chief sign--of nationality.... The\r\n    Irish language is a weapon in our fight against England, and\r\n    we cannot afford to throw away even the smallest weapon that\r\n    may serve us in that struggle.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the policy of the League as regards the primary schools is made\r\nquite clear by the resolution passed unanimously at their annual\r\nmeeting in 1912:--\r\n\r\n    \"That we re-affirm the demand of the last Ard Fheis in regard\r\n    to the position of Irish in the primary schools, viz., that\r\n    Irish be the sole medium of instruction in the Irish-speaking\r\n    districts; that it be the medium as far as possible in all\r\n    other schools, and that it be a compulsory subject in every\r\n    school throughout the country where parents are not opposed\r\n    to it; furthermore, that a knowledge of Irish be required from\r\n    all teachers entering for training as teachers, and that no\r\n    certificate be issued to those who fail to qualify in Irish at\r\n    the final examination, and that none but inspectors having a\r\n    knowledge of Irish be employed to inspect schools where Irish\r\n    is taught.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen therefore that if the League carry their point (as\r\nno doubt they will under a Home Rule Government) no graduate of the\r\nBelfast University who wishes to become a teacher in a Belfast school\r\nwill be allowed to do so unless he passes an examination in a language\r\nwhich not one of his pupils will ever wish to learn; and this, not for\r\nthe purpose of ensuring general culture, but to further a political\r\nobject with which he has no sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe League leave no stone unturned in their efforts to substitute the\r\nIrish for the English language. For instance, it is usually considered\r\nin other countries that the names of the streets of a town are put\r\nup in order to help people who want to find their way, and not for\r\npolitical reasons. But in Dublin, where not one per cent. of the\r\npeople can read Irish, the names have recently all been painted up in\r\nthat language, in the hope of de-Anglicizing the rising generation. An\r\nincident occurred recently which will show how the movement is being\r\ntaken up. There is in Dublin an excellent regulation that children\r\nmay not become \"street traders\" without a licence. A bright little boy\r\ncame to apply for one. The magistrate, being a kindly man, enquired\r\nof the lad what his circumstances were. The boy explained that part of\r\nhis earnings went towards the support of his widowed mother; and that\r\nhe was trying to keep up his education by attending a night school.\r\n\"And what are you learning there?\" said the magistrate. \"Irish,\"\r\nreplied the boy. Even the magistrate could not resist telling him that\r\nhe thought his time would be better spent at Arithmetic. Yet from the\r\nboy's point of view, there is something to be said. Irish may be of\r\nuse to him in obtaining a Government appointment, however small; for\r\nlocal bodies (such as the Dublin Boards of Guardians) now refuse\r\nto appoint clerks who cannot send out notices of meetings in Irish,\r\nthough no member of the Board to whom they are sent can read them; and\r\nthe League fully expect that the Home Rule Government will do the same\r\nwith regard to every appointment in their gift. If the railways are\r\ntaken over by the Government (as they probably will be) it can be seen\r\nwhat an immense impetus can be given to the movement.\r\n\r\nThen Secondary Schools have been established for the same object. The\r\n_Irish Educational Review_ recently contained the following account of\r\none of them:--\r\n\r\n    \"At Ring, in the County Waterford, there is already in\r\n    existence an Irish secondary school where classics, modern\r\n    languages and all the usual secondary school subjects are\r\n    taught and where Irish and English fill their rightful places,\r\n    the former being the ordinary language of the school, the\r\n    latter a foreign language on no higher level than French or\r\n    German.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1909, which founded the \"National\" University (to which I\r\nshall refer again), gave power to County Councils to levy a rate for\r\nscholarships. Immediately the Gaelic League saw their opportunity.\r\nThey endeavoured to persuade the Councils to refuse to do so unless\r\nIrish were made compulsory at the University. The Councils generally\r\n(except of course in Ulster) agreed to the plan; but some of them\r\n(such as the Kildare Council) were faced by a difficulty. Not a single\r\nchild in the county spoke Irish; and so if that language were made\r\ncompulsory, no one could compete for the scholarships. So they\r\ncompromised matters, by deciding that they would levy a rate if Irish\r\nwere made compulsory after 1915, by which time some of the young\r\npeople in the county would have been able to learn it; and the\r\nUniversity agreed to do so.\r\n\r\nThis rating power, I may remark, looks extremely liberal as it appears\r\nin the Act; for the scholarships are to be tenable at any University.\r\nThe Irish Unionist members, knowing quite well how it would be\r\nworked, opposed the clause; and as usual were denounced as bigots\r\nand fanatics. It is needless to add that as soon as the Act came into\r\nforce, County Councils and Corporations at once passed resolutions\r\nthat scholarships derived from the rates should not be tenable at\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, or at Belfast, but only at the National\r\nUniversity--thus practically saying that no Protestants need compete.\r\n\r\nBeyond forcing the children to acquire a smattering of Irish, it\r\ncannot be said that so far the efforts of the League as to the\r\nlanguage have been very successful; for the census returns show that\r\nthe proportion of the population who could speak Irish in 1891 was\r\n14'5; in 1901, 14'4; and in 1911, 13'3; and the numbers who spoke\r\nIrish only fell from 20,953 in 1901 to 16,870 in 1911.\r\n\r\nBut the efforts of the League are not confined to the language.\r\nEnglish games, such as cricket, are forbidden; if football is played,\r\nit must be the Gaelic variety with rules totally different from\r\nthose observed by the hated Saxon. Even the patients in asylums\r\nare forbidden to play cricket or lawn tennis. And some of the more\r\nenthusiastic members of the League have actually \"donned the saffron,\"\r\nin imitation of the Ersefied Normans of 400 years ago. However, it\r\nis so hideously ugly, and so suggestive of the obnoxious Orange, that\r\nthat phase of the movement is not likely to extend.\r\n\r\nEven the \"Boy Scout\" movement has been made use of for the same\r\nobject. As soon as some corps had been established in Ireland, the\r\nNationalists started a rival organization with an Irish name, in\r\nwhich all the boys solemnly undertake to work for the independence\r\nof Ireland, and never to join England's armed forces. The boys take a\r\nprominent part in the annual ceremonies in honour of Wolfe Tone, the\r\nManchester martyrs, and other Nationalist heroes.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing would be laughable if it were not so very sad. Even\r\nsuch matters as sports and education, where all creeds and parties\r\nmight be expected to work together amicably, must be used as\r\ninstruments to bring about separation; and the result already is not\r\nso much to widen the gulf between Ireland and England as the gulf\r\nbetween the two parties in Ireland; for the Protestant minority in\r\nthe south, who know that most of their children will have to leave the\r\ncountry, are not likely to let them fritter away their youth in the\r\nstudy of a language which can be of no possible benefit to them in\r\nany part of the world to which they may go; and the idea that the\r\nUlstermen will ever adopt a Celtic tongue is too ridiculous to be\r\nconsidered. But perhaps the most painful thought of all is that the\r\nNationalists should be ready even to sacrifice the prospects in life\r\nof the rising generation of the country in order to satisfy their\r\nblind hatred of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nIRELAND UNDER THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI come now to the policy which has been pursued by the present\r\nGovernment since 1906. It must be remembered that the Radical party\r\nreturned to power pledged to Home Rule as a principle, but with a\r\nsufficient majority to enable them to retain office without depending\r\non the Irish vote. Hence there was no necessity for them to introduce\r\na Home Rule Bill; but of course they set aside the policy of the\r\nUnionist Government, and resolved to govern Ireland according to their\r\nown ideas. What those ideas were, and what the result has been, I\r\nshall now proceed to show; but in doing so I shall as far as possible\r\nconfine myself to quotations and statistics which can be verified, so\r\nthat I may not be accused of giving an unfair report.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Secretary for the first year was Mr. Bryce, who was\r\nafterwards appointed British Ambassador at Washington. The Government\r\nat once repealed the Act which forbade the carrying of arms without a\r\nlicence; withdrew all proclamations under the Crimes Act of 1887;\r\nand resolved not to stop any political meetings. Accordingly the\r\nNationalists commenced holding a series of demonstrations all over\r\nthe country. A few specimens taken from the speeches made at them will\r\nsuffice to show their general tenour.\r\n\r\n    \"Let them all be ready, and when England got into trouble with\r\n    European Powers, they would pounce upon her with the ferocity\r\n    of a tiger.\"--_T. Walsh, District Councillor._\r\n\r\n    \"They must stand together as one man, and make it impossible\r\n    for England to govern Ireland.\"--_P. White, M.P._\r\n\r\n    \"If there had been 100,000 Fenians in Ireland at the time of\r\n    the Boer War there might now have been a Republic in\r\n    Ireland, and British supremacy would have been tumbled in the\r\n    dust.\"--_J. Daly, formerly Mayor of Limerick._\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Bryce, when leaving Ireland at the end of the year, stated\r\nthat he had not found any harm in any of the speeches delivered at the\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nAt this time the agitation began to assume a new form. One of the most\r\nimportant of Irish industries is the cattle trade with England,\r\nthe annual value of which exceeds £14,000,000. In several parts of\r\nIreland, notably in Meath and the central counties, the soil and\r\nclimate are specially suited for cattle raising, and the land\r\nis generally held in large grazing farms. It was decided by the\r\nNationalists in the autumn of 1906 that this industry must be\r\ndestroyed. Bodies of men assembled night after night to break down the\r\nfences and gates of the farms and drive the cattle many miles away,\r\nin order that the farmers might be ruined and forced to leave the\r\ncountry; and then the derelict farms would be divided amongst the\r\n\"landless men.\" L. Ginnell, M.P., explained the programme fully in a\r\nspeech he made in October 1906:--\r\n\r\n    \"The ranches must be broken up, not only in Westmeath but\r\n    throughout all Ireland ... He advised them to stamp out the\r\n    ranch demon themselves, and not leave an alien Parliament to\r\n    do the duty ... He advised them to leave the ranches unfenced,\r\n    unused and unusable ... so that no man or demon would dare to\r\n    stand another hour between the people and the land that should\r\n    be theirs.\"\r\n\r\nThe agitation, commencing in Meath, was gradually extended, county\r\nby county, over a large part of Ireland where the Nationalists are\r\nsupreme. Other measures were resorted to, in order to carry out their\r\nobject. Arson, the burning of hayricks, firing into dwelling-houses,\r\nspiking meadows, the mutilation of horses and cows, the destruction\r\nof turf, the damaging of machinery, and various other forms of lawless\r\nviolence began to increase and multiply. At the Spring Assizes in\r\n1907, the Chief Justice, when addressing the Grand Jury at Ennis, in\r\ncommenting on the increasing need for placing law-abiding people under\r\nspecial police protection, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"In a shire in England, if it was found necessary, either by\r\n    special protection or protection by patrol, to protect from\r\n    risk of outrage thirty persons, what would be thought?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Justice Kenny at Leitrim, after commenting upon the increased\r\nnumber of specially reported cases, as shown by the official\r\nstatistics, and alluding to several cases of gross intimidation,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"In these latter cases I regret to say no one has been\r\n    made amenable; and when there is such a state of things,\r\n    it justifies the observation made by the learned judge who\r\n    presided at last Connaught Winter Assizes, that when the chain\r\n    of terrorism was complete, no witness would give evidence and\r\n    no jury would convict.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr. Birrell, who at the beginning of the year had succeeded\r\nMr. Bryce as Chief Secretary, having no doubt studied these and\r\nsimilar reports, said in a speech at Halifax in the following month:--\r\n\r\n    \"You may take my word for this, that Ireland is at this moment\r\n    in a more peaceful condition than for the last six hundred\r\n    years.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, Mr. Justice Ross, who, as Judge of the Land Judge's\r\nCourt, Chancery Division, was in charge of many estates in Ireland,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    \"He had known from other Receivers about this widespread and\r\n    audacious conspiracy at present rampant in the West of Ireland\r\n    ... This was actually a conspiracy which on ordinary moral\r\n    grounds amounted to highway robbery, to seize on these grass\r\n    lands, to drive away the stock of the people who had been\r\n    in the habit of taking it; and then, when the owner had been\r\n    starved out, the Estates Commissioners were expected to buy up\r\n    the property and to distribute it amongst the very people who\r\n    had been urging on the business, and who had been engaged in\r\n    these outrages.\"\r\n\r\nWhen an Ulster member drew attention to this in the House of Commons,\r\nMr. Birrell replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"There is no evidence before the Government that a widespread\r\n    conspiracy is rampant in the West of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in reply to another question he said that:--\r\n\r\n    \"The reports he received from the police and other persons\r\n    revealed the condition of Ireland generally as to peace and\r\n    order as being very satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the month of October 1907, twenty-nine claims for compensation\r\nfrom the rates in respect of malicious injuries had been proved and\r\ngranted in twelve counties, the amount levied from the ratepayers\r\nbeing about £900. The malicious injuries comprised destruction of and\r\nfiring into dwelling houses, mutilation of horses and cattle, burning\r\ncattle to death, spiking meadows and damaging mowing machines, damages\r\nto fences and walls, burning heather and pasturage, damage to gates in\r\nconnection with cattle driving, and injury to cattle by driving. And\r\nin November an attempt was made to assassinate Mr. White Blake and his\r\nmother when driving home from church in the County Galway. A few days\r\nafter this occurred Mr. Redmond said at a meeting in North Wales:--\r\n\r\n    \"Whilst there is no crime or outrage there is widespread\r\n    unrest and impatience, and there are, over a certain section\r\n    of the country, taking place technical breaches of the strict\r\n    letter of the law in the shape of what is called cattle\r\n    driving. Now let me say first of all that in no instance has\r\n    any single beast been injured in the smallest degree in any of\r\n    these cattle-drives; in no instance has any malicious injury\r\n    been done to property, life or limb, or beast.\"\r\n\r\nAll this time the Government adhered to their determination not to put\r\nthe Crimes Act in force, but merely to place accused persons on trial\r\nbefore juries at the Assizes. The results were as follows: At the\r\nSummer Assizes in 1907, 167 persons were returned for trial; of these,\r\n57 were actually tried, of whom three were convicted, 31 acquitted,\r\nand in 23 cases the juries disagreed. The trials of the remaining 110\r\nwere postponed. At the Michaelmas sittings, 94 persons were put on\r\ntrial, of whom 5 were convicted and 2 acquitted; in 72 cases the\r\njuries disagreed, and in the remaining 15 the Crown abandoned\r\nproceedings. At the Winter Assizes 86 persons were tried for unlawful\r\nassembly, riot and conspiracy in connection with cattle-driving. None\r\nwere convicted; 11 were acquitted; in 12 cases the prisoners were\r\ndischarged on legal points; and in 63 the juries disagreed.\r\n\r\nI fully admit that there is much to be said for the juries who refused\r\nto convict. When a Government is doing its utmost to suppress anarchy\r\nand to enforce law and order, it is no doubt the duty of every loyal\r\nsubject to render assistance even at the risk of his own life\r\nand property. But when a Government is conniving at anarchy, and\r\ndeliberately refusing to put in force the Act which would put a stop\r\nto it, I say it is too much to expect of any man that he should face\r\nthe prospect of being ruined and probably murdered, and his family\r\nreduced to beggary, in order to enable the Government to keep up the\r\nfarce of pretending that they are trying to do their duty.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of 1908, there were 418 reported cases of\r\ncattle-driving; and arson, outrages with firearms, meadow-spiking,\r\nand similar offences increased in proportion. The judges urged in vain\r\nthat the law should be put in force. But the policy of the Government\r\nremained unchanged; the _Daily News_ (the Government organ) when\r\ncattle-driving was at its height said that thanks to the excellent\r\ngovernment of Mr. Birrell cattle-driving now had practically become\r\nextinct even in those few parts of the country in which it had\r\nexisted; and in July Mr. Birrell, addressing a political meeting at\r\nPort Sunlight, said that:--\r\n\r\n    \"They were led to believe that the state of Ireland was of\r\n    an appalling character, that crime predominated, and that\r\n    lawlessness almost universally prevailed. All he could say was\r\n    that a more cheerful land was nowhere to be found.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1909 matters became somewhat quieter, chiefly because Mr. Birrell\r\npromised to introduce a Land Bill by which the cattle-drivers hoped to\r\nget all they wanted. Hence their leaders advised them to \"give Birrell\r\na chance,\" but Mr. Redmond warned the Government that if they did not\r\ncarry out their pledge, they would speedily find Ireland ungovernable.\r\nIn February 1909, Lord Crewe, speaking for the Government in the House\r\nof Lords, made the remarkable statement:--\r\n\r\n    \"As regards intimidation, I have always shared the view that\r\n    well-organized intimidation cannot be checked by law. I know\r\n    no method of checking it.\"\r\n\r\nIf this is not an admission that the Government had failed in their\r\nduty, it is hard to say what is. The result of their line of action\r\nwill be seen by the following table, which has been taken from various\r\nreturns which the Ulster members, by repeated questions in Parliament\r\nat last succeeded in forcing Mr. Birrell to make public:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAgrarian outrages                  1906          234\r\n     \"    \"                        1907          372\r\n     \"    \"                        1908          576\r\nCattle-drives                      1905          Nil\r\n   \"    \"                          1907-8        513\r\n   \"    \"                          1908-9        622\r\n   \"    \"                          1908          219\r\nCattle maiming, mutilating, etc.   1907          142\r\nPersons boycotted                  1907          196\r\n     \"    \"                        1908          270\r\n     \"    \"                        1909          335\r\nCost of extra police               1908      £47,000\r\n\r\n\r\n1911.\r\n\r\nAgrarian outrages                                581\r\nMalicious injuries to property, Intimidating\r\n  by threatening letters, etc.                   285\r\nFiring into dwelling houses                       58\r\nRioting, robbery of arms, etc.                    31\r\nKilling and maiming cattle                        83\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, why did not the Ulster members call the attention of\r\nParliament to this state of things? The answer is, they did so again\r\nand again; Mr. Birrell gave stereotyped replies, much after this form,\r\nwith hardly a variation:--\r\n\r\n    I have seen in the newspapers a report that a few shots were\r\n    fired into a farmhouse in Galway. No one appears to have been\r\n    seriously injured. The police are making enquiries. No arrests\r\n    have been made.\r\n\r\n(He might as well have added that he knew perfectly well that no\r\narrests ever would be made.) Then he would go to a political meeting\r\nand say that the peaceful condition of Ireland was shown by the small\r\nnumber of criminal cases returned for trial at the Assizes; and would\r\nbitterly denounce the \"Carrion Crows\" (as he designated the Ulster\r\nmembers) for trying to blacken the reputation of their country.\r\n\r\nOne instance may be given more in detail, as typical of the condition\r\nto which Ireland had been brought. Lord Ashtown (a Unionist Peer\r\nresiding in County Galway) began issuing month by month a series of\r\npamphlets entitled \"Grievances from Ireland.\" They contained little\r\nbesides extracts from Nationalist papers giving reports of the\r\nmeetings of the United Irish League, the outrages that took place, and\r\nthe comments of Nationalist papers on them. His object was to let\r\nthe people in England see from the accounts given by the Nationalists\r\nthemselves, what was going on in Ireland. This, however, was very\r\nobjectionable to them; and one of their members asked Mr. Birrell in\r\nthe House of Commons whether the pamphlets could not be suppressed.\r\nMr. Birrell made the curious reply that he would be very glad if Lord\r\nAshtown were stopped, but that he did not see how to do it. What he\r\nexpected would be the results of that remark, I do not know; but no\r\none living in Ireland was much surprised when a few weeks afterwards\r\na bomb outrage occurred at the residence of Lord Ashtown in the County\r\nWaterford. It was a clumsy failure. A jar containing gunpowder was\r\nplaced against the wall of the house where he was staying and set on\r\nfire. The explosion wrecked part of the building, but Lord Ashtown\r\nescaped unhurt. He gave notice of his intention to apply at the next\r\nassizes for compensation for malicious injury. The usual custom in\r\nsuch cases is for a copy of the police report showing the injury\r\ncomplained of, to be sent to the person seeking compensation; but on\r\nthis occasion the police refused to show Lord Ashtown their report,\r\nstating that they had received orders from the Government not to do\r\nso. But shortly before the case came on, a report, not made by the\r\npolice authority in charge of the district, but by another brought in\r\nspecially for the purpose, appeared in the Nationalist papers. This\r\nreport contained the remarkable suggestion that Lord Ashtown had done\r\nit himself! When under cross-examination at the trial, the Inspector\r\nof the Royal Irish Constabulary who made the report was obliged to\r\nconfess that he did not believe that he had, but had only inserted the\r\nsuggestion in obedience to instruction received from the Government.\r\nLord Ashtown proved his case and was awarded compensation. But the\r\nmatter did not end there. He had employed a surveyor, Mr. Scully, to\r\ndraw plans and take photographs showing the amount of the damage. Mr.\r\nScully was surveyor to the Waterford Corporation. It was proposed at\r\nthe next meeting of the Corporation that he should be dismissed from\r\nhis office for having given evidence for Lord Ashtown. The motion\r\nwas carried unanimously, eight councillors being present; and at the\r\nfollowing meeting it was ratified by eight votes to two. A question\r\nwas asked about the matter in the House of Commons; and Mr. Birrell,\r\nwith the figures before him, replied that Mr. Scully had never been\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nTwo other instances of this period must be briefly referred to. It\r\nhas already been shown how the Irish Parliament endowed Maynooth as a\r\nCollege for Roman Catholic students both lay and theological; and how\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, opened its doors to all students, without\r\ndistinction of creed. But the Roman Catholic Church turned Maynooth\r\ninto a seminary for theological students only; and the bishops forbade\r\nyoung laymen to go to Trinity. In 1845 Sir Robert Peel attempted to\r\nsupply the want by founding the Queen's University, with Colleges at\r\nBelfast, Cork and Galway, where mixed education should be given in\r\nsecular subjects, and separate instruction in those appertaining to\r\nreligion; but that again was denounced as a \"satanic scheme for the\r\nruin of faith in the rising generation\"; and the crusade against\r\nthe university was so successful that in 1879 it was destroyed and\r\nanother--the Royal University--put in its place. This in its turn was\r\nabolished in 1909; the College at Belfast was raised to the status\r\nof a University, and a new University ominously called the \"National\r\nUniversity\" was founded into which the existing Colleges at Cork and\r\nGalway were absorbed, with a new and richly endowed College in Dublin\r\nat the head. It may seem strange that the Radical Government who are\r\npledged to destroy all religious education in England should found and\r\nendow a Denominational University in Ireland. But the matter could be\r\narranged by a little judicious management and prevarication; it was\r\nrepresented in Parliament that the new University was to be strictly\r\nunsectarian; during the debate, Sir P. Magnus, the member for the\r\nLondon University, said that he had no reason to believe that there\r\nwas any intention on the part of the Chief Secretary to set up\r\ndenominational Universities in Ireland; he accepted his word that they\r\nwere to be entirely undenominational. Then, when the Act was passed,\r\nthe Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin was appointed Chancellor of\r\nthe National University, with a number of Jesuits as Professors, and\r\nCardinal Logue stated as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"No matter what obstacles the Nonconformists may have inserted\r\n    in the Constitution of the University to keep it from being\r\n    Catholic, we will make it Catholic in spite of them.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I do not object to denominational Universities. I regret\r\nthat young men who are going to live in the same country should not be\r\nable to study law and medicine together; but if that is their feeling\r\nand the feeling of their parents, I admit that having separate\r\nUniversities may be the best solution of the difficulty. But if so,\r\nlet it be openly avowed that the University is denominational; to\r\n\"make it Catholic\" and at the same time to say that it is no injustice\r\nto Protestants that County Scholarships paid for by the ratepayers\r\nshould be tenable there and nowhere else, seems to me absurd.\r\n\r\nThe other incident to which reference must be made was the great\r\nConvention held in Dublin in 1909. The Nationalists, believing that\r\na Home Rule Bill would soon be introduced, devised the scheme of\r\nassembling a monster Convention, which would be evidence to the world\r\nof how admirably fitted the Irish people were to govern their own\r\ncountry. It was attended by 2,000 delegates from all parts of the\r\ncountry, who were to form a happy family, as of course no disturbing\r\nUnionist element would be present to mar the harmony and the clerical\r\nelement would be strong. Mr. Redmond, who presided, said in his\r\nopening address:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ireland's capacity for self-government will be judged at home\r\n    and abroad by the conduct of this Assembly. Ireland's good\r\n    name is at stake, and therefore every man who takes part\r\n    in this Assembly should weigh his words and recognise his\r\n    responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting ended in a free fight.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1909 Mr. Asquith did a very clever thing. A general\r\nelection was pending, and he wished to avoid the mistake which\r\nGladstone had made in 1885. He therefore, at a great meeting at\r\nthe Albert Hall unfolded an elaborate programme of the long list of\r\nmeasures which the Government would introduce and carry, and in the\r\ncourse of his remarks said that Home Rule was the only solution of\r\nthe Irish problem, and that in the new House of Commons the hands of\r\na Liberal Government and of a Liberal majority would in this matter be\r\nentirely free. He and his followers carefully abstained from referring\r\nto the subject in their election addresses; and Mr. Asquith was thus\r\nfree, if he should obtain a majority independent of the Irish vote,\r\nto say that he had never promised to make Home Rule part of his\r\nprogramme; but if he found he could not retain office without that\r\nvote, he might buy it by promising to introduce the Bill and refer to\r\nhis words at the Albert Hall as justification for doing so. The latter\r\nhappened; hence the \"Coalition Ministry.\" The Irish party consented to\r\nplease the Radicals by voting for the Budget, and the Nonconformists\r\nby voting for Welsh Disestablishment, on condition that they should\r\nin return vote for Home Rule. As Mr. Hobhouse (a Cabinet Minister)\r\nexpressed it in 1911:--\r\n\r\n    \"Next year we must pay our debt to the Nationalist Members,\r\n    who were good enough to vote for a Budget which they detested\r\n    and knew would be an injury to their country.\"\r\n\r\nBut the people of England still had to be hood-winked. It was hardly\r\nlikely that they would consent to their representatives voting for\r\nthe separation of Ireland from Great Britain; so the Nationalists and\r\ntheir Radical allies went about England declaring that they had\r\nno wish for such a thing; that all they desired was a subordinate\r\nParliament leaving the Imperial Parliament supreme. Thus Mr. Redmond\r\nsuggested at one meeting that Ireland should be conceded the right\r\nof managing her own purely local affairs for herself in a subordinate\r\nParliament, subject to the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament; and\r\nat another meeting said:\r\n\r\n    \"We are not asking for a Repeal of the Union. We are not\r\n    asking for the restoration of a co-ordinate Parliament such\r\n    as Ireland had before the Union. We are only asking that\r\n    there should be given to Ireland a subordinate Parliament. We\r\n    therefore admit the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament. That\r\n    means that after this subordinate Parliament is created in\r\n    Ireland, if the Parliament is foolish enough, rash enough, as\r\n    it never will be, but if it were foolish enough and criminal\r\n    enough to use the powers given to it for injustice or\r\n    oppression of any class or creed, the Imperial Parliament\r\n    would have the power to stretch forth the arm of its authority\r\n    and to say 'you shall not do that.'\"\r\n\r\nOf course it may be argued that they had changed their minds; that\r\nin former times they worked for separation, but now realised that\r\na subordinate Parliament was all that Ireland required. But\r\nunfortunately for this theory, they have themselves repudiated it;\r\nwhen Mr. Redmond was accused of speaking with two voices, one in\r\nAmerica and one in Great Britain, he passionately replied:--\r\n\r\n    \"I indignantly deny that accusation. I have never in my life\r\n    said one word on a platform in America one whit stronger than\r\n    I had said in my place on the floor of the House of Commons.\r\n    I have never in America or anywhere else, advocated the\r\n    separation of Ireland from Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nHow far this is true, the quotations from his speeches which have\r\nalready been given, will have shown. But the Government have kept up\r\nthe farce; Mr. Winston Churchill said during the debate on the Bill of\r\n1912:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Home Rule movement has never been a separatist movement.\r\n    In the whole course of its career it has been a moderating,\r\n    modifying movement, designed to secure the recognition of\r\n    Irish claims within the circuit of the British Empire.\"\r\n\r\nBut not even the immediate prospect of Home Rule can be said to have\r\nmade those parts of Ireland where the League is supreme a happy place\r\nof residence to any but advanced Nationalists. The following report of\r\na case in the Magistrate's Court at Ennis in November 1912 will speak\r\nfor the condition of the County Clare:--\r\n\r\n    Patrick Arkins was charged with knocking down walls on the\r\n    farm of Mrs. Fitzpatrick in order to compel her to give up the\r\n    farm. Inspector Davis gave evidence that from January 1910 to\r\n    that date there were 104 serious outrages in his district.\r\n    In 42 firearms were used, 27 were malicious injuries, 32 were\r\n    threatening notices, 1 case of bomb explosion outside a house,\r\n    1 robbery of arms, and 1 attempted robbery. A sum of £268 had\r\n    been awarded as compensation for malicious injury and there\r\n    were claims for £75 pending for malicious injuries committed\r\n    during the week ended 11th inst. There were two persons under\r\n    constant police protection, and 16 receiving protection by\r\n    patrol. Head Constable Mulligan said that Mrs. Fitzpatrick was\r\n    under police protection. Since February 11th, 1912, there had\r\n    been 12 outrages in the district, Mrs. Fitzpatrick was under\r\n    almost constant police protection. Acting Sergeant Beegan\r\n    deposed that there had been 12 outrages on the Fitzpatrick\r\n    family during the last four years; these included driving\r\n    cattle off the lands, threatening notices, firing shots at the\r\n    house, knocking down walls, spiking meadows; the new roof of\r\n    a hay barn was perforated with bullets, and at Kiltonaghty\r\n    Chapel there were notices threatening death to anyone who\r\n    would work for Mrs. Fitzpatrick. Timothy Fitzpatrick gave\r\n    similar evidence as to the outrages, and said that his father\r\n    had taken the farm twenty-one years ago, and had paid the son\r\n    of the former tenant £40 for his goodwill.\r\n\r\n(I may add that Arkins was committed for trial, convicted at the\r\nAssizes and sentenced to seven years penal servitude; and was released\r\nby Mr. Birrell a few weeks afterwards.)\r\n\r\nIn another Clare case, in February of the present year, the resident\r\nMagistrate said as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is a mistake to say that these outrages are arising out\r\n    of disputes between landlord and tenant; nine out of ten arise\r\n    out of petty disputes about land. What is the use of having\r\n    new land laws? A case occurred not long ago in this county of\r\n    a man who had bought some land twenty years ago, and paid down\r\n    hard cash to the outgoing tenant. The man died, and left a\r\n    widow and children on the land for fourteen years. But in 1908\r\n    a man who had some ulterior object got the man who had sold\r\n    the farm to send in a claim under the Evicted Tenant's Act,\r\n    which was rejected. That was what the advisers of the man\r\n    wanted--they only wanted a pretext for moonlighting and other\r\n    disgraceful outrages, and the woman was kept in a hell for\r\n    four years. A man was caught at last and convicted, and one\r\n    would think that this was a subject for rejoicing for all\r\n    right-minded men in the county. But what was the result? A\r\n    perfect tornado of letters was printed, and resolutions\r\n    and speeches appeared in the public press, condemning this\r\n    conviction of a moonlighter in Clare as an outrage against\r\n    justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Bishop of Killaloe, in a sermon preached in\r\nDecember 1912, referring to County Clare said:--\r\n\r\n    \"That county had had an evil record in the matter of crime,\r\n    and they were so accustomed to outrages of almost weekly\r\n    occurrence around them that it was not easy to shock them.\r\n    There was an inoffensive family sitting round the fireside\r\n    with a couple of neighbours. They had given no offence, they\r\n    had wronged no man, they had crossed no man's path. But that\r\n    inhuman beast went to the door and lifted the latch, and\r\n    there, at a few yards distance, fired into that innocent group\r\n    of men, women and children, as if they were a flock of crows,\r\n    killing the mother outright and almost blowing the forehead\r\n    off a young girl. There was no denying the fact that that\r\n    brutal murder was the natural outcome of the disgraceful\r\n    system of intimidation and outrage that had been rampant for\r\n    a long time in certain districts of that unhappy county and\r\n    of the immunity from punishment enjoyed by the wicked and\r\n    cowardly moonlighter. In addition to their other acts of\r\n    savagery, they had shot out the eyes of two men within the\r\n    last couple of years. A decent, honest man was shot on the\r\n    road to Ennis. The people passed the wounded man by and\r\n    refused to take him into their car through fear. Not one\r\n    of these well-known miscreants was brought to justice. The\r\n    murderers of poor Garvey, the cow-houghers, the hay-burners,\r\n    were said to be known. In any other country, for instance in\r\n    the United States, such ruffianism would be hunted down or\r\n    lynched; but there, in the places he referred to, they had\r\n    a curtain of security drawn round them by the cowardice or\r\n    perverted moral sense on the part of the community amongst\r\n    whom they lived.... It was only last Thursday night, before\r\n    the county had recovered from the shock of Mrs. O'Mara's\r\n    murder, that right over the mountain an unfortunate postman\r\n    was shot on the public road between Crusheen and Baliluran for\r\n    no other reason apparently than that another fellow wanted his\r\n    job of one and six-pence a day! It has come to this, that if\r\n    you differ with one of them for a shilling, or refuse to give\r\n    him his way in everything the first thing that comes into his\r\n    head is to moonlight you.... They have not elevation or social\r\n    instinct to settle their petty disputes by process of law\r\n    provided for the purpose by a civilized society, nor have they\r\n    Christianity enough to bear a little wrong or disappointment\r\n    for Christ's sake. No, nor the manliness even to meet an\r\n    opponent face to face and see it out with him like a man; but\r\n    with the cunning of a mean and vicious dog, he steals behind\r\n    him in the dark and shoots him in the back, or murders the\r\n    helpless woman of his family, or shoots out the eyes of the\r\n    poor man's horse, or cuts the throat of his bullock and spikes\r\n    his beast upon a gate.\"\r\n\r\nNor has the present year brought much improvement. In May 1913, Mr.\r\nR. Maunsell was fired at and wounded close to the town of Ennis. His\r\ncrime was that he managed a farm for a Mr. Bannatyne, whose family had\r\nbeen in possession of it for about sixty years, but who had recently\r\nbeen denounced by the United Irish League and ordered to surrender it.\r\nAs he has refused to do so, he is now compelled to live under police\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of landlordism and the acquisition of firearms can\r\nhardly be said to have brought peace and tranquillity to the County of\r\nClare.\r\n\r\nAnd as to Galway, we may gather the state of affairs from the report\r\nof a case tried at the Winter Assizes of 1912. Three men were charged\r\nwith having done grievous bodily harm to a man named Conolly. Conolly\r\nswore that he knew a man named Broderick who had become unpopular but\r\nhe (Conolly) kept to him and this brought displeasure on him from the\r\naccused and others. On the night of the 11th September he went to bed;\r\nhe was subsequently awakened and found 44 grains of shot in his left\r\nknee and four in his right. He then lay flat on the floor. Other shots\r\nwere fired through the window but did not strike him. The judge said\r\nthe district was a disgrace to Ireland. Day after day, night after\r\nnight, heaps of outrages were committed there, and not one offender\r\nwas made amenable to justice. The jury disagreed, and the accused were\r\nagain put on their trial. The judge in charging the jury on the second\r\ntrial said that then, and for some time, the district was swarming\r\nwith police, and though outrages were frequent, it was impossible for\r\nthem to bring anyone to justice. No one was sure he might not be fired\r\nat during the night; and people were afraid to give evidence. The jury\r\nagain disagreed.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1912 an effort was made to hold a series of\r\nmeetings throughout the south and west of Ireland to protest against\r\nHome Rule. The conduct of the Nationalists with regard to them\r\nsupplies a striking commentary on Mr. Redmond's statement at Banbury\r\nnot long before, that all through his political life he had preached\r\nconciliation towards those who differed from him on the question\r\nof Home Rule. The meetings were in some cases stopped by force; at\r\nLimerick the windows of the Protestant Church and of some houses\r\noccupied by Protestants were smashed; at Tralee the principal speaker\r\nwas a large farmer named Crosbie; all his hay and sheds were burned\r\ndown, and he was awarded £600 compensation by the County Court Judge.\r\n\r\nBut an incident had occurred in the north which, though in a sense\r\ncomparatively slight, has, in consequence of the circumstances\r\nconnected with it, done more to inflame the men of Ulster than persons\r\nnot living in Ireland can realise. In June of last year a party of\r\nSunday School children from a suburb of Belfast went for a picnic to\r\nCastledawson (co. Derry) under the charge of a Presbyterian minister\r\nand a few teachers and ladies. On their way back to the railway\r\nstation, they were met and assailed by a procession of men belonging\r\nto the Order of Hibernians armed with pikes who attacked the children\r\nwith the pikes and with stones, seized a Union Jack which a small\r\nboy was carrying, and knocked down and kicked some of the girls and\r\nteachers. Worse might have happened had not some Protestant young men,\r\nseeing what was going on, come to the rescue. The minister was struck\r\nwith stones whilst he was endeavouring to get some of the children\r\nto a place of safety. No Nationalist has ever expressed the slightest\r\nregret at the occurrence. Several of the aggressors were tried at the\r\nWinter Assizes and sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Before\r\nthe end of the term they were released by order of the Government. Mr.\r\nBirrell, in justifying his action, said that the judge had remarked\r\nthat there was no evidence before him of actual injury. This, like\r\nmany of his statements, was literally true; but he omitted to mention\r\nthat he had prevented the evidence from being given; the injured women\r\nand children were quite ready to give their testimony, but were not\r\ncalled by the counsel for the crown.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that this foretaste of Home Rule government\r\nhas made the Presbyterians of Ulster more determined than ever to\r\nresist it to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nI shall next proceed to consider the Bill which the Government have\r\nintroduced as a panacea for the woes of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCRITICISM OF THE BILL NOW BEFORE THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the maintenance of the Union is possible, and that complete\r\nseparation is possible, are two indisputable facts. But the question\r\nis, was Wolfe Tone right when he said that these were the only two\r\npossibilities; or is there a third one, and if so, what?\r\n\r\nResidents in the Dominions will naturally be inclined to reply \"Yes;\r\nplace Ireland in the position of a colony possessing responsible\r\ngovernment, such as New Zealand.\" It is a taking idea; but a little\r\nreflection will show the falseness of the analogy. The relations\r\nbetween the Mother Country and the self-governing colonies (now\r\noften called \"Dominions\") have grown up of themselves; and, like\r\nmost political conditions which have so come about, are theoretically\r\nillogical but practically convenient. The practical convenience arises\r\npartly from the friendly spirit which animates both parties, but still\r\nmore from the nature of the case. The distance which separates the\r\nMother Country from the Dominions causes the anomalies to be scarcely\r\nperceptible. In theory the Sovereign, acting on the advice of\r\nBritish Ministers, can disallow any colonial statute, and the British\r\nParliament is supreme--it can pass laws that will bind the colonies,\r\neven laws imposing taxes. But we all know that if the Home Government\r\nwere persistently to veto laws passed by the large majority of the\r\npeople in New Zealand, or the British Parliament were to attempt to\r\nlegislate for the colonies, relations would at once become strained,\r\nand separation would be inevitable. The only important matters on\r\nwhich the Home Government attempts to bind the colonies are those\r\nrelating to foreign countries (which are necessarily of an Imperial\r\nnature) and those as to which the colonies themselves wish to have\r\nan Act passed, such as the Act establishing Australian Federation. In\r\nother words, the \"supremacy of Parliament,\" which is a stern reality\r\nin England, has very little meaning as regards New Zealand. Even if\r\nthe people of New Zealand were to manage the affairs of their country\r\nin a manner contrary to English ideas--for instance if they were to\r\nestablish State lotteries and public gambling tables--England would be\r\nbut slightly affected, and certainly would never think of taking steps\r\nto prevent them. And those matters in which the Home Government is\r\nobliged to act are just those in which New Zealand has no desire\r\nto interfere; for instance, New Zealand would never want to appoint\r\nconsuls of her own (which was the immediate cause of the separation\r\nbetween Norway and Sweden); in the very few cases in which New Zealand\r\ndesires to make use of political or commercial agents abroad, she is\r\ncontent to employ the British representatives, for whom she is\r\nnot called upon to pay. If New Zealand attempted to take part in a\r\nEuropean war in which England was not concerned--the idea is almost\r\ntoo absurd to suggest--the only thing that England could do would be\r\nto break off the connection and repudiate New Zealand altogether.\r\nAnd if New Zealand desired to separate from the Mother Country, many\r\npeople would think it a most grievous mistake, but England certainly\r\nwould not seek to prevent her doing so by force; and though England\r\nwould in some ways be the worse for it, the government of England\r\nand of the rest of the Empire would go on much the same as before. In\r\ncertain points, it is true, thoughtful men have generally come to the\r\nconclusion that the present state of affairs cannot go on unchanged;\r\nthe time is coming when the great Dominions must provide for their own\r\ndefence by sea as well as by land; and whether this is to be done by\r\nseparate navies working together or by joint contributions to a\r\ncommon navy, it will probably result in the formation of some Imperial\r\nCouncil in which all parts will have a voice. That however, is a\r\nmatter for future discussion and arrangement.\r\n\r\nBut when we turn to Ireland, everything is different. The two islands\r\nare separated by less than fifty miles. Ireland has for more than a\r\ncentury been adequately represented in the Imperial Parliament; the\r\njourney from Galway to London is shorter than that from Auckland\r\nor Dunedin to Wellington. So long as Europe remains as it is, Great\r\nBritain and Ireland must have a common system of defence--which means\r\none army, one navy, and one plan of fortifications. Again, Irishmen,\r\ntraders and others, will constantly have to make use of government\r\nagents in other countries. Now unless Great Britain is to arrange and\r\npay for the whole of this, we are met at once by the insoluble problem\r\nof Irish representation in the British Parliament. If Ireland is not\r\nrepresented there, we are faced with the old difficulty of taxation\r\nwithout representation; if Ireland is represented there for all\r\npurposes, Ireland can interfere in the local affairs of England, but\r\nEngland cannot in those of Ireland; if we have what has been called\r\nthe \"in-and-out\" scheme as proposed by Gladstone in 1893--that is, for\r\nthe Irish members to vote on all questions of an Imperial nature,\r\nbut to retire when matters affecting England only are under\r\ndiscussion--then, even if the line could be drawn (which is doubtful)\r\nwe might have the absurdity of an English ministry which possessed\r\nthe confidence of the majority of Englishmen and whose management of\r\nEngland met their approval, being turned out of office by the Irish\r\nvote, and England being governed according to a policy which the\r\nmajority of Englishmen detested. Of course it may be said that there\r\nought to be a number of small Parliaments in the British Isles, like\r\nthose in the Provinces of Canada or the States of Australia, with one\r\ngreat Parliament supreme over them--in other words, Federation.\r\nThat might be a good thing, although it would in its turn start many\r\ndifficulties which it is unnecessary now to discuss, for it is not\r\nHome Rule nor does Home Rule lead to it. Federal systems arise by the\r\nunion of separate States, each State giving up a part of its power\r\nto a joint body which can levy taxes and can overrule the local\r\nauthorities. In fact, when Federation comes about, the States cease to\r\nbe nations.\r\n\r\n(I must here remark in passing that constant confusion has been caused\r\nby the various senses in which the word \"nation\" is used. Thus it is\r\noften quite correctly employed in a sentimental sense--we speak of\r\nScottish National character, or of the National Bible Society of\r\nScotland, though Scotland has no separate Parliament or flag and would\r\non a map of Europe be painted the same colour as the rest of Great\r\nBritain. Quite distinct from that is the political sense, in which the\r\nIrish Nationalists use the word when speaking of being \"A Nation once\r\nagain,\" or of \"The National Independence of Ireland.\")\r\n\r\nIt might be possible for the United Kingdom to be broken up into a\r\nFederation (though it is strange that there is no precedent in history\r\nfor such a course); but that would not be \"satisfying the National\r\nAspirations of Ireland.\" In fact, as Mr. Childers, one of the ablest\r\nof English advocates of Home Rule, has stated: \"The term Federal, as\r\napplied to Irish Home Rule at the present time, is meaningless.\"\r\n\r\nBut when we come to examine the existing Bill, which will become law\r\nin 1914 unless something unforeseen occurs, we find that it is neither\r\nthe Colonial plan nor Federation but an elaborate system which really\r\nseems as if it had been devised with the object of satisfying nobody\r\nand producing friction at every point. England (by which of course I\r\nmean Great Britain; I merely use the shorter term for convenience)\r\nis not only to pay the total cost of the army, navy and diplomatic\r\nservices, including the defences of Ireland, but is also to grant an\r\nannual subsidy to Ireland commencing with £500,000 but subsequently\r\nreduced to £200,000. Whether the English taxpayer will relish this\r\nwhen he comes to realise it, may be doubted. Certainly no precedent\r\ncan be cited for a Federal system under which all the common\r\nexpenditure is borne by one of the parties. And further, the present\r\nGovernment state freely that they hope to carry out their policy by\r\nintroducing a Bill for Home Rule for Scotland and possibly also for\r\nWales. Will the Scotch and Welsh consent to contribute towards the\r\ngovernment of Ireland; or will they demand that they shall be treated\r\nlike Ireland, and leave the people of England to pay all Imperial\r\nservices and to subsidize Ireland, Scotland and Wales? Then again,\r\nIreland is to send forty-two representatives to what is still\r\nsarcastically to be called the \"Parliament of the United Kingdom,\" but\r\nwill no doubt popularly be known as the English Parliament. They\r\nare to vote about the taxation of people in Great Britain, and to\r\ninterfere in local affairs of that country, whilst the people of\r\nGreat Britain are not to tax Ireland or interfere in any way with its\r\naffairs. This is indeed representation without taxation. Of course it\r\nis inevitable that the Irish members will continue to do what they are\r\ndoing at present--that is, offer their votes to whatever party will\r\npromise further concessions to Irish Nationalism; and they will\r\nprobably find no more difficulty in getting an English party to\r\nconsent to such an immoral bargain than they do now.\r\n\r\nThe provisions as to legislation for Ireland are still more\r\nextraordinary. The Irish Parliament is to have complete power of\r\nlegislating as to Irish affairs, with the exception of certain matters\r\nenumerated in the Act; thus it may repeal any Acts of the Imperial\r\nParliament passed before 1914. On the other hand, the English\r\nParliament (in which Ireland will have only forty-two representatives)\r\nwill also be able to pass laws binding Ireland (and in this way to\r\nre-enact the laws which the Irish Parliament has just repealed), and\r\nthese new laws the Irish Parliament may not repeal or overrule. Now\r\nthis power of the English Parliament will either be a reality or a\r\nfarce; if it is a reality, the Irish Nationalists will be no more\r\ninclined to submit to laws made by \"an alien Parliament\" in which they\r\nhave only forty-two representatives than they are at present to submit\r\nto those made by one in which they have 103; if it is a farce, the\r\n\"supremacy of the Imperial Parliament\" is a misleading expression.\r\nThe Lord Lieutenant is to act as to some matters on the advice of the\r\nIrish Ministry, as to others on the advice of the English. Anyone who\r\nhas studied the history of constitutional government in the colonies\r\nin the early days, when the governor was still supposed to act as\r\nto certain affairs independently of ministerial advice, will see the\r\nconfusion to which this must lead. Suppose the Lord Lieutenant acts\r\non the advice of the English ministers in a way of which the\r\nIrish Parliament do not approve, and the Irish Ministry resign in\r\nconsequence, what can result but a deadlock?\r\n\r\nBut most extraordinary of all are the provisions as to finance. The\r\nGovernment appointed a Committee of Experts to consider this question.\r\nThe committee made their report; but the Government rejected their\r\nadvice and substituted another plan which is so elaborate that it is\r\nonly possible to touch on some of its more important features here.\r\nI have already said that the English Parliament will have no power\r\nto tax Ireland. That statement, however, must be taken subject to two\r\nreservations. The Bill provides that if ever the happy day arrives\r\nwhen for three consecutive years the revenue of Ireland has exceeded\r\nthe cost of government, the English Parliament (with the addition of\r\ntwenty-three extra members summoned from Ireland for the purpose)\r\nmay make new provisions securing from Ireland a contribution towards\r\nImperial expenditure. As this is the only reference to the subject\r\nin the Bill, the general opinion was that until those improbable\r\ncircumstances should occur, the English Parliament would have no power\r\nto tax Ireland; but when the debates were drawing to a close, the\r\nGovernment astonished the House by stating that according to their\r\nconstruction of the Bill, should any new emergency arise at any time\r\nafter the Bill becomes law (for instance, a great naval emergency\r\nrequiring an addition to the Income Tax) it would be not merely the\r\nright but also the duty of the Imperial Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nto see that the charge should be borne by the whole United Kingdom--in\r\nother words, the Parliament in which Ireland possesses only forty-two\r\nrepresentatives may and ought to tax Ireland for Imperial purposes.\r\nThe friction which will arise should any attempt of the sort be made,\r\nespecially as the power is not stated in the Bill, is evident. In\r\nplain words, it will be impossible to levy the tax.\r\n\r\nBut apart from these rights, which one may safely say will never be\r\nexercised, the financial arrangements will from their very complexity\r\nbe a constant source of trouble. All taxes levied in Ireland are to be\r\npaid into the English Exchequer (or as it is called in the Bill \"The\r\nExchequer of the United Kingdom\"). Some of the objects for which\r\nthese taxes have been levied are to be managed by the Irish\r\nGovernment--these are called \"Irish services\"; others are to be\r\nmanaged by the English Government--these are called \"Reserved\r\nservices.\" The English Exchequer will then hand over to the Irish\r\nExchequer:--\r\n\r\n    (a) A sum representing the net cost to the Exchequer of the\r\n    United Kingdom of \"Irish Services\" at the time of the passing\r\n    of the Act;\r\n\r\n    (b) The sum of £500,000 a year, reducible to £200,000, above\r\n    referred to; and\r\n\r\n    (c) A sum equal to the proceeds of any new taxes levied by the\r\n    Irish Parliament.\r\n\r\nThen the balance which the English Exchequer will retain, after\r\nhanding over these three sums, will go to the \"Reserved Services.\" But\r\nas, in consequence of the establishment of the Old Age Pensions\r\nand some other similar liabilities, the aggregate cost of governing\r\nIreland at this moment exceeds the revenue derived from Ireland by\r\nabout £1,500,000, the English taxpayer will have to make up this sum,\r\nas well as to give to Ireland an annual present of £500,000; and\r\neven if the Irish Government succeeds in managing its affairs more\r\neconomically than the Government at present does, that will give no\r\nrelief to the British taxpayer, for it will be observed that the first\r\nof the three sums which the Exchequer of the United Kingdom is to hand\r\nover is not a sum representing the cost of the \"Irish Services\" at any\r\nfuture date but the cost at the time of the passing of the Act.\r\n\r\nIt is possible of course that the Irish revenue derived from existing\r\ntaxes may increase, and so the burden on the English taxpayer may\r\nbe lightened; but as it is more probable that it will decrease, and\r\nconsequently the burden become heavier, the English taxpayer cannot\r\nderive much consolation from that.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing remarks that a number of extremely\r\nintricate and difficult financial questions must arise; for instance,\r\nwhat sum really represents the net cost of \"Irish Services\" at the\r\ntime of the passing of the Act; what sum equals the net proceeds of\r\nnew taxes imposed by the Irish Parliament; and at what moment it can\r\nbe said that the revenue of Ireland has for three consecutive years\r\nexceeded the cost of government. All such matters are to be decided\r\nby a Board of Five, of whom one is to be nominated by the King\r\n(presumably on the advice of the English Ministers), two by the\r\nEnglish Government, and two by the Irish. From the decisions of this\r\nBoard on matters of fact there is to be no appeal. It is needless\r\nto point out that every detail in which the three English members\r\noverrule the two Irish will be fought out again in the English\r\nParliament by the forty Irish members. This again will show how vain\r\nis the hope that future English Parliaments will be relieved from\r\nendless discussions as to Irish affairs. Professor Dicey has well\r\nnamed the able work in which he has analysed the Bill and shown its\r\nimpossibilities \"A Fool's Paradise.\"\r\n\r\nThe provisions concerning those matters as to which the Irish\r\nParliament is to have no power to legislate are as strange as the\r\nother clauses of the Bill. For six years the Constabulary are to be a\r\n\"reserved service\"; but as they will be under the orders of the Irish\r\nGovernment, the object of this is hard to see--unless indeed it is to\r\ncreate an impression that the Ulstermen if they refuse to obey them\r\nare rebelling not against the Irish but the Imperial Government. The\r\nPost Office Savings Banks are \"reserved\" for a longer period; as to\r\nthe postal services to places beyond Ireland, the Irish Parliament\r\nwill have no power to legislate; but the Post Office, so far as it\r\nrelates to Ireland alone, will be handed over at once to the Irish\r\nParliament--although even in the case of Federal Unions such as\r\nAustralia the Post Office is usually considered to be eminently a\r\nmatter for the Federal authority. And the question whether an Irish\r\nAct is unconstitutional and therefore void will be decided by the\r\nPrivy Council, which will be regarded as an essentially English body;\r\nhence if it attempts to veto an Irish Act, its action will be at once\r\ndenounced as a revival of Poyning's Act and the Declaratory Act of\r\nGeorge I.\r\n\r\nThe Bill excludes the relations with Foreign States from the powers of\r\nthe Irish Parliament, but says nothing to prevent the Irish Government\r\nfrom appointing a political agent to the Vatican. That is probably one\r\nof the first things that it will do; and as the Lord Lieutenant could\r\nnever form a Government which would consent to any other course, he\r\nwill be obliged to consent. This agent, not being responsible to the\r\nBritish Foreign Office, may cause constant friction between England\r\nand Italy.\r\n\r\nBut quite apart from the unworkable provisions of the Bill, everything\r\nconnected with its introduction and passing through Parliament has\r\ntended to increase the hatred which the Opposition feel towards it,\r\nand the determination of the Ulstermen to resist it if necessary even\r\nby force. Those who lived in Australia whilst Federation was under\r\ndiscussion will recollect how carefully the scheme was brought before\r\nthe people, discussed in various Colonial Parliaments, considered over\r\nagain line by line by the delegates in an Inter-Colonial Conference,\r\nexamined afresh in the Colonial Office in London and in the Imperial\r\nParliament and finally laid before each colony for its acceptance. Yet\r\nhere is a matter which vitally affects the government not of Ireland\r\nonly but of the whole United Kingdom, and thus indirectly of the\r\nEmpire at large; it was (as I have shown) not fairly brought before\r\nthe people at a general election; it has been introduced by what\r\nis admittedly merely a coalition Government as a matter of bargain\r\nbetween the various sections, at a time when the British Constitution\r\nis in a state of dislocation, as the power of the House of Lords has\r\nbeen destroyed and the new Upper Chamber not yet set up; and it has\r\nbeen passed without adequate discussion. This I say deliberately; it\r\nis no use to point out how many hours have been spent in Committee,\r\nfor the way in which the discussion has been conducted has deprived\r\nit of any real value. The custom has been for the Government to state\r\nbeforehand the time at which each batch of clauses is to be passed,\r\nand what amendments may be discussed (the rest being passed over in\r\nsilence); when the discussion is supposed to begin, their supporters\r\nostentatiously walk out, and the Opposition argue to empty benches;\r\nthen when the moment for closing the discussion arrives, the Minister\r\nin charge gets up and says that the Government cannot accept any of\r\nthe amendments proposed; the bell rings, the Government supporters\r\ntroop back, and pass all the clauses unamended. As an instance of this\r\ncontemptible way of conducting the debate, it is sufficient to point\r\nto the fact already mentioned, that so vital a matter as the power\r\nof the English Parliament to tax Ireland was not even hinted at until\r\nnearly the end of the debates.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Bill is to become law without any further appeal to the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAre English Unionists to be blamed if they declare that an Act so\r\npassed will possess no moral obligation, and that they are determined,\r\nshould the terrible necessity arise, to aid the Ulstermen in resisting\r\nit to the uttermost?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE DANGER TO THE EMPIRE OF ANY FORM OF HOME RULE. THE QUESTIONS\r\nANSWERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I explained how hopelessly unworkable is the\r\nparticular scheme of Home Rule which is contained in the present\r\nBill. I now proceed to show why Home Rule in any form must lead to\r\ndisaster--primarily to Ireland, ultimately to the Empire.\r\n\r\nPoliticians who, like ostriches, possess the happy faculty of shutting\r\ntheir eyes to unpleasant facts, may say that there is only one nation\r\nin Ireland; but everyone who knows the country is quite aware that\r\nthere are two, which may be held together as part of the United\r\nKingdom, but which can no more be forced into one nation than\r\nBelgium and Holland could be forced to combine as the Kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands. And whatever cross-currents there may be, the great line\r\nof cleavage is religion. Of course I am aware of the violent efforts\r\nthat have been made ever since the commencement of the Nationalist\r\nagitation to prove that this is not so. Thus Parnell, addressing an\r\nEnglish audience, explained that religion had nothing to do with the\r\nmovement, and as evidence stated that he was the leader of it though\r\nnot merely a Protestant but a member of the Protestant Synod and a\r\nparochial nominator for his own parish. Of course everyone in Ireland\r\nknew perfectly well that he was only a Protestant in the sense that\r\nGaribaldi was a Roman Catholic--he had been baptised as such in\r\ninfancy; and that he was not a member of the synod or a parochial\r\nnominator, and never had been one; but the statement was good enough\r\nto deceive his Nonconformist hearers. That Protestant Home Rulers\r\nexist is not denied. But the numbers are so small that it is evident\r\nthat they are the rare exceptions that prove the rule. The very\r\nanxiety with which, when a Protestant Home Ruler can be discovered\r\nhe is put forward, and the fact of his being a Protestant Home Ruler\r\nreferred to again and again, shows what a rare bird he is. To mention\r\none instance amongst many; a Protestant Home Ruler has recently\r\nbeen speaking on platforms in England explaining that he came in a\r\nrepresentative capacity in order to testify to the people of England\r\nthat the Irish Protestants were now in favour of Home Rule. He did\r\nnot mention the fact that in the district where he resided there\r\nwere about 1,000 Protestants and he was the only Home Ruler amongst\r\nthem--in fact, nearly all the rest had signed a Petition against the\r\nBill. And when we come to examine who these Protestant Home Rulers\r\nare, about whom so much has been said, we find first that there is in\r\nthis as in every other movement, a very small number of faddists, who\r\nlike to go against their own party; secondly a few who though they\r\nstill call themselves Protestants have to all intents and purposes\r\nabandoned their religion, and therefore cannot fairly be reckoned;\r\nthirdly, a few who hold appointments from which they would be\r\ndismissed if they did not conform; fourthly, some who say openly that\r\nHome Rule is coming and that whatever their private opinions may be it\r\nis the wisest policy to worship the rising sun (bearing in mind that\r\nMr. Dillon has promised that when the Nationalists attain their end\r\nthey will remember who were their friends and who their enemies, and\r\ndeal out rewards and punishments accordingly); and fifthly, those who\r\nhave accepted what future historians will describe as bribes. For the\r\npresent Government have showered down Peerages, Knighthoods of\r\nvarious orders, Lieutenancies of Counties, Deputy-Lieutenancies and\r\nCommissions of the Peace--not to speak of salaried offices both\r\nin Ireland and elsewhere--on Protestants who would consent to turn\r\nNationalists, in a manner which makes it absurd to talk any more about\r\nbribery at the time of the Union. And yet with all this the Protestant\r\nHome Rulers are such an extremely small body that they may be\r\ndisregarded. And indeed it is hard to see how an earnest, consistent\r\nand logically-minded Protestant can be a Nationalist; for loyalty to\r\nthe King is a part of his creed; and, in the words of a Nationalist\r\norgan, the _Midland Tribune_, \"If a man be a Nationalist he must _ipso\r\nfacto_ be a Disloyalist, for Irish Nationalism and loyalty to the\r\nthrone of England could not be synonymous.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a large proportion of the educated Roman Catholics,\r\nthe men who have a real stake in the country, are Unionists. Some\r\nof them, however earnest they may be in their religion, dread the\r\ndomination of a political priesthood; others dread still more the\r\nunion of the Church with anarchism. As has already been shown,\r\nthey refuse to join the United Irish League; some in the north have\r\nactually subscribed the Ulster Covenant; many others have signed\r\npetitions against Home Rule throughout the country; and a still larger\r\nnumber have stated that they would gladly do so if they did not fear\r\nthe consequences. It is probably therefore correct to say that\r\nthe number of Unionists in Ireland decidedly exceeds the number of\r\nProtestants; in other words, less than three-fourths of the population\r\nare Nationalists, and more than one-fourth (perhaps about one-third)\r\nare Unionists. And more than that; if we are to test the reality of\r\na movement, we must look not merely at numbers but at other matters.\r\nViolent language may be used; but the fact remains as I have\r\npreviously stated that even if the Nationalists are taken as being\r\nonly two-thirds of the population, their annual subscriptions to the\r\ncause do not amount to anything like a penny per head and that the\r\nagitation could not last for six months if it were not kept alive\r\nby contributions from America and the Colonies. But though the\r\nNationalist movement has not brought about a Union between the Orange\r\nand the Green, it has caused two other Unions to be formed which will\r\nhave an important influence on the future history of the country. In\r\nthe first place it has revived, or cemented, the Union which, as we\r\nhave seen, existed at former periods of Irish history, but which has\r\nexisted in no other country in the world--the Union between the\r\nBlack and the Red. That a Union between two forces so essentially\r\nantagonistic as Ultramontanism and Jacobinism will be permanent, one\r\ncan hardly suppose; whether the clericals, if they succeed in crushing\r\nthe heretics, will afterwards be able to turn and crush the anarchists\r\nwith whom they have been in alliance, and then reign supreme; or\r\nwhether, as happened in France at the end of the eighteenth century\r\nand in Portugal recently, the anarchists who have grown up within\r\nthe bosom of the Church will prove to be a more deadly foe to the\r\nclericals than the heretics ever were--it is impossible to say; but\r\nneither prospect seems very cheerful.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the Nationalist movement has drawn all the\r\nProtestant bodies together as nothing else could. Episcopalians,\r\nPresbyterians and Methodists have all joined hands in the defence of\r\ntheir common liberties. The Nationalists have left no stone unturned\r\nin their efforts to prove that the northern Protestants are disloyal.\r\nThey have succeeded in finding one speech that was made by an excited\r\norator (not a leader) forty-four years ago, to the effect that the\r\nDisestablishment of the Church might result in the Queen's Crown being\r\nkicked into the Boyne. As this is the only instance they can rake up,\r\nit has been quoted in the House of Commons and elsewhere again\r\nand again; and Mr. Birrell (whose knowledge of Ireland seems to be\r\nentirely derived from Nationalist speeches) has recently elaborated\r\nit by saying that when the Church was going to be disestablished\r\n\"they used to declare\" that the Queen's Crown would be kicked into the\r\nBoyne, and yet their threats came to nothing and therefore the\r\nresult of Home Rule will be the same. The fact was that the Church\r\nestablishment was the last relic of Protestant Ascendancy; and as\r\nI have already shown, that meant Anglican ascendancy in which\r\nPresbyterianism did not participate; hence, when the agitation for\r\nDisestablishment arose, though some few Presbyterians greatly disliked\r\nit, their opposition as a whole was lukewarm. But when in 1886 Home\r\nRule became a question of practical politics, they rose up against it\r\nas one man; in 1893, when the second Home Rule Bill was introduced and\r\nactually passed the House of Commons, they commenced organising their\r\nVolunteer army to resist it, if necessary, by force of arms; and\r\nthey are just as keen to-day as they were twenty years ago. They are\r\ncertainly not disloyal; the republican spirit which permeated\r\ntheir ancestors in the eighteenth century has long since died out\r\ncompletely. Sir Walter Scott said that if he had lived at the time of\r\nthe Union between Scotland and England, he would have fought against\r\nit; but, living a century later and seeing the benefit that it had\r\nbeen to his country, his feelings were all on the other side. That is\r\nwhat the Presbyterians of Ulster say to-day. They point to the way in\r\nwhich Ulster has, under the Union, been able to develop itself; with\r\nno richer soil, no better climate, and no greater natural advantages\r\nthan other parts of Ireland, the energy, ability, and true patriotism\r\nof the people have enabled them to establish and encourage commerce\r\nand manufactures which have brought wealth and prosperity to Ulster\r\nwhilst the other Provinces have been stationary or retrograde. There\r\ncannot be a better instance of the different spirit which animates the\r\ntwo communities than the history of the linen industry. Michael Davitt\r\nbitterly described it as \"Not an Irish, but an Orange industry.\" And\r\nfrom his point of view, he was quite right; for it is practically\r\nconfined to Ulster. In that Province it has during the nineteenth\r\ncentury developed so steadily that the annual export now exceeds\r\n£15,000,000 in value and more than 70,000 hands are employed in the\r\nmills. Not long ago, a Royal Commission was appointed to enquire\r\nwhether it was not possible to grow flax in the south and west, and\r\nif so why it was not done. The Commission made careful enquiries, and\r\nreported that in both Munster and Connaught efforts had been made to\r\nestablish the industry (notably by the late Lord Bandon, one of the\r\nmuch-abused landlord class, who had let land for the purpose at a\r\nnominal charge, obtained seed and brought experts from the north\r\nto instruct the people); that it had been proved that both soil and\r\nclimate were quite as well adapted for it as in Ulster; but that after\r\na few years the buyers refused any longer to purchase the flax as it\r\nwas so carelessly and badly prepared that it was valueless; and so\r\nthe industry had died out. In both south and west the people expressed\r\ntheir readiness to revive it if a large grant were made to them by the\r\nGovernment, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nThen again we may take the growth of the cities. It seems hard now to\r\nrealise that one reason why the people of Dublin opposed the Union was\r\nbecause they feared lest, when their city ceased to be the capital,\r\nCork might grow into a great industrial centre and surpass it. Cork\r\nhas remained stationary ever since; Belfast, then an insignificant\r\ncountry town, has become a city of 400,000 inhabitants, and the\r\ncustoms from it alone are more than double those from all the rest of\r\nIreland put together. And what is true of Belfast is true also on a\r\nsmaller scale of all the other towns north of the Boyne.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable contrast between the progress of the north-east and\r\nthe stagnation of the rest of the country is no new thing. It has been\r\nobserved ever since the Union. So long ago as 1832 the Report of the\r\nCommission on the linen manufacture of Ireland contained the following\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n    \"Political and religious animosities and dissensions, and\r\n    increasing agitation first for one object and then for\r\n    another have so destroyed confidence and shaken the bonds of\r\n    society--undermined men's principles and estranged\r\n    neighbour from neighbour, friend from friend, and class\r\n    from class--that, in lieu of observing any common effort\r\n    to ameliorate the condition of the people, we find every\r\n    proposition for this object, emanate from which party it may,\r\n    received with distrust by the other; maligned, perverted and\r\n    destroyed, to gratify the political purposes of a faction....\r\n    The comparative prosperity enjoyed by that portion of Ireland\r\n    where tranquillity ordinarily prevails, such as the Counties\r\n    Down, Antrim, and Derry, testify the capabilities of Ireland\r\n    to work out her own regeneration, when freed of the disturbing\r\n    causes which have so long impeded her progress in civilization\r\n    and improvement. We find there a population hardy, healthy and\r\n    employed; capital fast flowing into the district; new sources\r\n    of employment daily developing themselves; a people well\r\n    disposed alike to the government and institutions of their\r\n    country; and not distrustful and jealous of their superiors.\r\n    Contrast the social condition of these people with such\r\n    pictures as we have presented to us from other districts.\"\r\n\r\nThis energetic, self-reliant and prosperous community now see before\r\ntheir eyes what the practical working of government by the League is.\r\nThey see it generally in the condition of the country, and especially\r\nin the Dublin Convention of 1909, the narrow-minded administration of\r\nthe Local Government Act wherever the power of the League prevails,\r\nand the insecurity for life and property in the west; they know also\r\nthat a Home Rule Government must mean increased taxation (as the\r\nNationalists themselves confess) which will probably--in fact, one may\r\nalmost say must certainly, as no other source is available--be thrown\r\non the Ulster manufactures; is it not therefore a matter of life and\r\ndeath to them to resist it to the uttermost?\r\n\r\nBut as I have said, the great line of cleavage is religion. Here I\r\nknow that I shall be accused of \"Orange bigotry.\" But I am not afraid\r\nof the charge; first because I do not happen to be an Orangeman; and\r\nsecondly because I regard bigotry as the outcome of ignorance and\r\nprejudice, and consider therefore that a calm examination of the\r\nevidence is the very antithesis of bigotry. In order to make this\r\nexamination I desire in the first place to avoid the mistake that\r\nGrattan made in judging the probabilities of the future from the\r\nopinions of personal friends whom I like and respect, but who, as I\r\nknow (and regret to think), possess no influence whatever. I consider\r\nthat there are other data--such as works of authority, the action\r\nof the public bodies, statements by men in prominent positions,\r\nand articles in leading journals--from which it is safer to form\r\nan estimate. The Ulstermen are content that the country should be\r\ngoverned, as far as religion is concerned, on modern principles--that\r\nis to say, in much the same way that England, Australia and New\r\nZealand are governed to-day. The Nationalists, whatever they may\r\nsay in England or the Colonies, have never in Ireland from the\r\ncommencement of the movement attempted to deny that their object is\r\nto see Ireland governed on principles which are totally different\r\nand which the Ulstermen detest. As long ago as 1886, the _Freeman's\r\nJournal_, the leading Nationalist organ, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"We contend that the good government of Ireland by England\r\n    is impossible ... the one people has not only accepted but\r\n    retained with inviolable constancy the Christian faith;\r\n    the other has not only rejected it, but has been for three\r\n    centuries the leader of the great apostasy, and is at this day\r\n    the principal obstacle to the conversion of the world.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as recently as December 1912, Professor Nolan of Maynooth,\r\naddressing the Roman Catholic students at the Belfast University,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"Humanly speaking, we are on the eve of Home Rule. We shall\r\n    have a free hand in the future. Let us use it well. This is\r\n    a Catholic country, and if we do not govern it on Catholic\r\n    lines, according to Catholic ideals, and to safe-guard\r\n    Catholic interests, it will be all the worse for the country\r\n    and all the worse for us. We have now a momentous opportunity\r\n    of changing the whole course of Irish history.\"\r\n\r\nThen another of their papers, the _Rosary_, has said: \"We have\r\nplayed the game of tolerance until the game is played out\"; and has\r\nprophesied that under Home Rule the Church will become an irresistible\r\nengine before whom all opposition must go down. And whatever the\r\neducated laity may desire, no one who knows Ireland can doubt that\r\nit is the clerical faction that will be all-powerful. The leading\r\necclesiastics are trained at the Gregorian University at Rome; and\r\none of the Professors at that institution, in a work published in 1901\r\nwith the special approval of Pope Leo XIII, enunciated the doctrine\r\nthat it is the duty of a Christian State to put to death heretics\r\nwho have been condemned by the Ecclesiastical Court. Of course no one\r\nsupposes that such a thing will ever take place in Ireland; but what\r\nthe Ulstermen object to is putting themselves under the rule of\r\nmen who have been trained in such principles and believe them to be\r\napproved by an infallible authority.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 some foreign merchants at Barcelona wished to build a church\r\nfor themselves. Republican feeling is so strong in the municipality\r\nthat permission was obtained without difficulty. But the bishop\r\nat once protested and appealed to the King. The King wrote back a\r\nsympathetic letter expressing his deep regret that he was unable to\r\nprevent this fresh attack on the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nWe are constantly being told that the tolerance and liberality shown\r\nby the majority in Quebec is sufficient of itself to prove how foolish\r\nare the apprehensions felt by the minority in Ireland. Well, I will\r\nquote from a journal which cannot be accused of Protestant bias,\r\nthe _Irish Independent_, one of the leading organs of the\r\nNationalist-clerical party in Ireland:--\r\n\r\n    \"(From our own Correspondent.)\r\n\r\n    \"Montreal, Thursday.\r\n\r\n    \"In connection with the celebration of the anniversary of\r\n    Wolfe's victory and death, which takes place in September,\r\n    prominent members of the Anglican Church have inaugurated a\r\n    movement for the erection of a Wolfe Memorial Chapel on\r\n    the Plains of Abraham. The organisers of the movement hope\r\n    ultimately to secure the transfer of the General's remains to\r\n    the chapel for interment on the scene of his victory.\r\n\r\n    \"The population being largely French-Canadian Catholics, the\r\n    Catholic Church organ of Quebec strongly protests against\r\n    the erection of an Anglican chapel in the heart of a Catholic\r\n    district.\"\r\n\r\nNow if this conduct on the part of the Roman Catholic authorities is\r\nquite right at Barcelona and Quebec, why is it \"Orange bigotry\"\r\nto suggest that the same people may act in the same way at Cork or\r\nGalway?\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1910, a remarkable volume was published, written by Mrs.\r\nHugh Fraser, the sister of the novelist, Marion Crawford, entitled \"A\r\nDiplomat's Wife in Many Lands.\" The authoress was a very able woman,\r\nwho had travelled much and mixed in cultured society wherever she had\r\nbeen; her book was highly reviewed by various English Magazines. She\r\ntells the story of a child of Jewish parents living at Rome in the\r\ndays of Pope Pius IX, who was secretly baptized in infancy by a nurse,\r\nand at the age of seven was forcibly taken from his parents and placed\r\nin a Convent School. She explains that not only was this quite right,\r\nbut that such a course is inevitable in every country in which the\r\nChurch has power; and that the feelings of the heretic mother whose\r\nchild is taken from her are a fair subject of ridicule on the part of\r\ngood Catholics. Can Irish Protestants be accused of bigotry when they\r\ncontend that these writers mean what they say? English Nonconformists\r\nargue that they ought to wait until the time comes and then either\r\nfight or leave the country; but the Irish Protestants reply that it\r\nis more sensible to take steps beforehand to ward off the danger. And\r\nwhether they are right or wrong, the fact remains that those are their\r\nideas, and that is their determination; and this is the situation\r\nwhich must be faced if Home Rule is forced upon the people of Ulster.\r\n\r\nBy a striking coincidence, two meetings have recently been held on the\r\nsame day--the 16th of May 1913--which form an apt illustration of\r\nthe position adopted by the two parties. The first was a great\r\ndemonstration of Unionists at Belfast, organised in order to make a\r\nfurther protest against the Bill and to perfect the organisation for\r\nopposing it by force, if the necessity arises; the second was a large\r\nmeeting of the United Irish League at Mullingar. The Chairman, Mr.\r\nGinnell, M.P. (who has gained prominence and popularity by his skill\r\nin arranging cattle-drives), said that the chief cause of the pressure\r\nlast session was to get the Home Rule Bill through its first stage. It\r\nwas still called a Home Rule Bill, though differing widely from\r\nwhat most of them always understood by Home Rule. Deeply though he\r\nregretted the Bill's defects and limitations, still he thought almost\r\nany Parliament in Ireland was worth accepting--first, because it was\r\nin some sense a recognition of the right to govern themselves; and\r\nsecondly, because even a crippled Parliament would give them fresh\r\nleverage for complete freedom. No one could be silly enough to suppose\r\nthat an intelligent Ireland, having any sort of a Parliament of its\r\nown, would be prevented by any promise given now by place-hunters,\r\nfrom using that Parliament for true national purposes.\r\n\r\nThat no army which the Ulstermen can form will be able to stand\r\nagainst British troops supported by cavalry and artillery is evident;\r\nbut it seems almost past belief that England should be ready to\r\nplunge the country into civil war; or that British troops should march\r\nout--with bands playing \"Bloody England, we hate you still,\" or some\r\nother inspiring Nationalist air--to shoot down Ulstermen who will come\r\nto meet them waving the Union Jack and shouting \"God save the King.\"\r\nAnd if they do--what then? Lord Wolseley, when Commander-in-Chief in\r\nIreland in 1893, pointed out the probable effect on the British Army\r\nin a letter to the Duke of Cambridge:--\r\n\r\n    \"If ever our troops are brought into collision with the\r\n    loyalists of Ulster, and blood is shed, it will shake the\r\n    whole foundations upon which our army rests to such an extent\r\n    that I feel that our Army will never be the same again. Many\r\n    officers will resign to join Ulster, and there will be such\r\n    a host of retired officers in the Ulster ranks that men who\r\n    would stand by the Government no matter what it did, will be\r\n    worse than half-hearted in all they do. No army could stand\r\n    such a strain upon it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then England, having crushed her natural allies in Ulster, will\r\nhand over the Government of Ireland to a party whose avowed object\r\nis to break up the Empire and form a separate Republic. Dangers and\r\ndifficulties arose even when the independent legislature of Ireland\r\nwas in the hands of men who were loyal and patriotic in the noblest\r\nsense of the term, and when there were in every district a certain\r\nnumber of educated gentlemen of position who (as we have seen) were\r\nalways ready to risk their lives and fortunes for the defence of the\r\nrealm; what will happen when the loyal minority have been shot down,\r\ndriven out of the country, or forced into bitter hostility to the\r\nGovernment who have betrayed and deserted them? As Lecky wrote years\r\nago:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is scarcely possible to over-estimate the danger\r\n    that would arise if the vast moral legislative, and even\r\n    administrative powers which every separate legislature must\r\n    necessarily possess, were exercised in any near and vital\r\n    part of the British Empire, by men who were disloyal to its\r\n    interests. To place the government of a country by a voluntary\r\n    and deliberate act in the hands of dishonest and disloyal men,\r\n    is perhaps the greatest crime that a public man can commit:\r\n    a crime which, in proportion to the strength and soundness of\r\n    national morality, must consign those who are guilty of it to\r\n    undying infamy.\"\r\n\r\nIf English people are so blind that they cannot perceive this,\r\nforeigners, whose vision is clearer, have warned them. Bismarck said\r\nthat England, by granting Home Rule to Ireland, would dig its own\r\ngrave; and Admiral Mahan has recently written:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is impossible for a military man or a statesman to look\r\n    at the map and not perceive that the ambition of the Irish\r\n    separatists, if realised, would be even more threatening to\r\n    the national life of Great Britain than the secession of the\r\n    South was to the American Union.\r\n\r\n    \"The legislative supremacy of the British Parliament against\r\n    the assertion of which the American Colonists revolted\r\n    and which to-day would be found intolerable in Canada and\r\n    Australia cannot be yielded in the case of an island, where\r\n    independent action might very well be attended with fatal\r\n    consequences to its partner. The instrument for such action,\r\n    in the shape of an independent Parliament, could not be safely\r\n    trusted even to avowed friends.\"\r\n\r\nSo then, having reviewed the evidence as calmly and dispassionately as\r\nI can, I answer the two questions which I propounded at the outset of\r\nthe enquiry--That the real objects of the Nationalists are the\r\ntotal separation of Ireland from England and the establishment of an\r\nIndependent Republic; and that the men of Ulster in resisting them\r\nto the uttermost are not merely justified on the ground of\r\nself-preservation, but are in reality fighting for the cause of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe following Report of the Annual Pilgrimage in memory of Wolfe Tone,\r\nwhich took place on the 22nd of June last, and the article in the\r\n_Leinster Leader_ (a prominent Nationalist journal) will show how\r\nclosely the Nationalists of to-day follow in the footsteps of Wolfe\r\nTone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORY OF WOLFE TONE.\r\n\r\nANNUAL PILGRIMAGE TO BODENSTOWN.\r\n\r\n(_From our Reporter_.)\r\n\r\nOn Sunday last the annual pilgrimage to the grave of Theobald Wolfe\r\nTone took place to Bodenstown churchyard. This year the numbers who\r\nattended exceeded those of last year, about a thousand coming from\r\nDublin and another contingent from Tullamore, Clare, and Athlone. The\r\nprocession formed outside Sallins station was a most imposing one,\r\nbeing made up of St. James' Brass Band and the Lorcan O'Toole Pipers'\r\nBand and the Athlone Pipers' Band, the National Boy Scouts, the\r\nDaughters of Erin, and members of the Wolfe Tone Memorial Clubs.\r\n\r\nAt the graveside demonstration, Mr. Thos. J. Clarke presided and said\r\nit was a gratifying thing that numbers of their fellow-countrymen were\r\nto-day swinging back to the old fighting line and taking pride in the\r\nold Fenian principles. He introduced Mr. P.H. Pearse, B.A.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearse then came forward and delivered an eloquent and impressive\r\noration, first speaking in Irish. Speaking in English, he said they\r\nhad come to the holiest place in Ireland, holier to them than that\r\nsacred spot where Patrick sleeps in Down. Patrick brought them life,\r\nbut Wolfe Tone died for them. Though many had testified in death\r\nto the truth of Ireland's claim to Nationhood, Wolfe Tone was the\r\ngreatest of all that had made that testimony; he was the greatest of\r\nIreland's dead. They stood in the holiest place in Ireland, for what\r\nspot of the Nation's soil could be holier than the spot in which the\r\ngreatest of her dead lay buried. He found it difficult to speak in\r\nthat place, and he knew they all partook of his emotion. There were\r\nno strangers there for they were all in a sense own brothers to Tone\r\n(hear, hear). They shared his faith, his hope still unrealised and\r\nhis great love. They had come there that day not merely to salute this\r\nnoble dust and to pay their homage to the noble spirit of Tone, but\r\nto renew their adhesion to the faith of Tone and to express their\r\nfull acceptance of the gospel of which Tone had given such a clear\r\ndefinition. That gospel had been taught before him by English-speaking\r\nmen, uttered half-articulately by Shan O'Neill, expressed in some\r\npassionate metaphor by Geoffrey Keating, and hinted at by Swift in\r\nsome bitter jibe, but it was stated definitely and emphatically by\r\nWolfe Tone and it did not need to be ever again stated anew for any\r\nnew generation. Tone was great in mind, but he was still greater in\r\nspirit. He had the clear vision of the prophet; he saw things as they\r\nwere and saw things as they would be. They owed more to this dead man\r\nthan they should be ever able to repay him by making pilgrimages to\r\nhis grave or building the stateliest monuments in the streets of\r\nhis city. They owed it to him that there was such a thing as Irish\r\nNationalism; to his memory and the memory of '98 they owed it that\r\nthere was any manhood left in Ireland (hear, hear). The soul of\r\nWolfe Tone was like a burning flame, a flame so pure, so ardent, so\r\ngenerous, that to come into communion with it was as a new optimism\r\nand regeneration. Let them try in some way to get into contact with\r\nthe spirit of Tone and possess themselves of its ardour. If they could\r\ndo that it would be a good thing for them and their country, because\r\nthey would carry away with them a new life from that place of death\r\nand there would be a new resurrection of patriotic grace in their\r\nsouls (hear, hear). Let them think of Tone; think of his boyhood\r\nand young manhood in Dublin and in Kildare; think of his adventurous\r\nspirit and plans, think of his glorious failure at the bar, and his\r\nhealthy contempt for what he called a foolish wig and gown, think how\r\nthe call of Ireland came to him; think how he obeyed that call; think\r\nhow he put virility into the Catholic movement; think how this heretic\r\ntoiled to make freemen of Catholic helots (applause). Think how he\r\ngrew to love the real and historic Irish nation, and then there came\r\nto him that clear conception that there must be in Ireland not three\r\nnations but one; that Protestant and Dissenter must close in amity\r\nwith Catholic, and Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter must unite to\r\nachieve freedom for all (applause). Let them consider the sacrifices\r\nTone had made; he had to leave so much. Never was there a man who was\r\nso richly endowed as he was, he had so much love in his warm heart. He\r\n(speaker) would rather have known Tone than any other man of whom he\r\never read or heard. He never read of any one man who had more in him\r\nof the heroic stuff than Tone had; how gaily and gallantly he had set\r\nabout the doing of a mighty thing. He (speaker) had always loved the\r\nvery name of Thomas Russell because Tone so loved him. To be Tone's\r\nfriend! What a privilege! for Tone had for his friends an immense\r\nlove, an immense charity. He had such love for his wife and children!\r\nBut such was the destiny of the heroes of their nation; they had\r\nto stifle in their hearts all that love and that sweet music and to\r\nfollow only the faint voice that called them to the battlefield or to\r\nthe harder death at the foot of the gibbet. Tone heard that voice and\r\nobeyed it and from his grave to-day he was calling on them and they\r\nwere there to answer his voice; and they pledged themselves to\r\ncarry out his programme to abolish the connection with England,\r\nthe never-failing source of political evils and to establish\r\nthe independence of their country, to abolish the memory of past\r\ndissensions, and to replace for the denominations of Protestant,\r\nCatholic and Dissenter, the common name of Irishman (applause).\r\nIn that programme was to be found the whole philosophy of Irish\r\nNationality; that programme included the philosophy of the Gaelic\r\nLeague and of later prophets, and it was to that programme they\r\npledged their adhesion; they pledged it now at the graveside of Tone;\r\nthey pledged themselves to follow in the steps of Tone, never to rest\r\nby day or night until this be accomplished, until Ireland be free\r\n(applause); fighting on, not in despondency, but in great joy as Tone\r\nfought; prizing it above all privileges, and hoping for the victory in\r\ntheir own day. And if it should be granted to them in this generation\r\nto complete the work that Tone's generation left unaccomplished! But\r\nif that was not their destiny, they should fight on still, hoping\r\nstill, self-sacrificing still, knowing as they must know that causes\r\nlike this did not lose for ever, and that men like Tone did not die in\r\nvain (applause).\r\n\r\nThe address having concluded, wreaths were placed on the grave by the\r\nNational Boy Scouts and the Inghanite Na h-Eireann.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon an aeridheacht was held in an adjoining field at\r\nwhich music, songs and recitations were contributed, and a thoroughly\r\nenjoyable Irish-Ireland evening was spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE GRAVE OF WOLFE TONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lifework of Theobald Wolfe Tone, for the subversion of English\r\nGovernment in Ireland, and the supreme sacrifice he made in the mighty\r\neffort to erect in its stead an independent Ireland free from all\r\nforeign denomination and control, was fittingly commemorated on Sunday\r\nlast, when the annual pilgrimage took place to Bodenstown Churchyard,\r\nwhere all that is mortal of the great patriot lie buried. The\r\npilgrimage this year was worthy of the cause and the man, and afforded\r\nsome object lessons in what might be accomplished by a cultivation of\r\nthose principles of discipline and devotion to duty, in the pursuit\r\nof a glorious ideal, which Tone taught and adhered to throughout his\r\nadventurous and brilliant career. The well-ordered procession,\r\nthe ready obedience to the commands of the marshals, the intense\r\nearnestness of the multitude, and the display made by the youths--the\r\nnational boy scouts--their military bearing, and the bands and banners\r\nwhich interspersed the procession as it marched from Sallins to\r\nBodenstown was a spectacle which pleased the eye and stirred the\r\nemotions. Everything in connection with the pilgrimage was carried out\r\nwith a close attention to detail, and military-like precision which\r\nmust have been very acceptable to the great patriot in whose honour\r\nit was organised, were he but permitted to gaze from the great Unknown\r\nupon this practical demonstration of the perpetuation of the spirit\r\nwhich animated him and his time, in the struggle against English\r\nmisrule, and the love and veneration in which he is still held, after\r\nthe lapse of the century and more that has passed since he made the\r\nfinal sacrifice of his life in the cause of freedom. Tone done to\r\ndeath did not die in vain. The truth of this was evident in the\r\ncharacter of the pilgrimage on Sunday last, when all that is best and\r\npurest in patriotism in the land assembled at his graveside, to renew\r\nfealty to the aims and ideals for which he suffered and died, and to\r\nhear the gospel of Irish nationality preached and expounded as he knew\r\nand inculcated it in his day. A fusion of forces, and the cultivation\r\nof a spirit and bond of brotherhood and friendship amongst Irishmen\r\nin the common cause, were his methods to attain the great ideal of\r\na separate and distinct nationality, for then, as to-day, the chief\r\nobstacle to freedom and nationhood was not so much English domination\r\nin itself, as want of cohesion, faction, and the disruption caused\r\nby alien traditions and teachings. This was the prevailing spirit of\r\nSunday's commemoration, and as the great mass of people filed past in\r\norderly array and knelt, prayed, and laid wreaths on the lonely grave,\r\nthe solemnity and impressiveness of the occasion was intensified.\r\nIn the suppressed murmurs, and silent gaze on the tomb of the mighty\r\ndead, one could recognise the eagerness and the hope for another Tone\r\nto arise to complete the work which he promoted, and vindicate the\r\npurity of the motives which moved men like the leaders of '98 to do\r\nand dare for all, and to \"substitute the common name of Irishman\r\nfor Catholic, Protestant, and Dissenter.\" The promoters, too, were\r\nfortunate in their choice of orator for the occasion. Mr. P.H. Pearse\r\ndid full justice to the occasion, and in language, beautiful and\r\nimpressive, pictured the man and his movements and the lessons to be\r\ndrawn by us to-day from the lifework of leaders in thought and action\r\nlike Tone. Close and consistent adhesion to principles of patriotism\r\nand a readiness of self-sacrifice in the pursuit of those principles,\r\nwere his distinguishing characteristics all through life, and if we in\r\nour time would emulate the example of Tone and his times, we must also\r\nbe ready when the call came to meet any demand made upon us for the\r\npromotion of our national welfare. The orator of the day rightly, in\r\nour opinion, described that hallowed spot in Bodenstown as one of the\r\nholiest places in Ireland to-day, from the nationalist standpoint,\r\nholding as it does the ashes of the man who, without friends, money or\r\ninfluence to help him, and by sheer force of character, intensity of\r\npurpose and earnestness, prevailed upon the greatest emperor-general\r\nthe world has ever seen Napoleon Bonaparte, to make a descent on\r\nIreland, in order to aid our starved, tortured, and persecuted people\r\nto shake off the shackles that kept them in slavery, and elevate\r\nIreland once more to the dignity of full, free, and untrammelled\r\nnationhood. We are all familiar with the events following this great\r\neffort of Tone's, and the dark chapters that closed a glorious career.\r\nAll that is mortal of Tone is in the keeping of Kildare, and it is\r\na trust that we feel sure is not alone felt to be a high honour,\r\nbut which cannot fail to keep the cultivation of a high standard of\r\nnationality before the people in whose midst repose the remains of one\r\nof Ireland's greatest sons. Ireland, from the centre to the sea,\r\nwas represented in Sunday's great gathering to commemorate the\r\nachievements of Wolfe Tone, and the occasion was honoured first by\r\nthe large and representative character of the throng, secondly by the\r\ndecorum observed all through the day's proceedings, and thirdly, by\r\nthe regularity and precision which attended the entire arrangements.\r\nThere was just one other feature which must have been very gratifying\r\nto those identified with the organisation of the pilgrimage,\r\nnamely: the large proportion of ladies and young people, coming long\r\ndistances, who made up the gathering. And they were by no means the\r\nleast enthusiastic of the throng. This enthusiasm amongst our young\r\npeople is one of the most encouraging and promising signs of the\r\ntimes, serving as it does to demonstrate the undying spirit of Irish\r\nnationality, and the perpetuation of those principles to which Tone\r\ndevoted his time, talents, and eventually made the supreme sacrifice\r\nof his life in having inculcated amongst his people. It is a glorious\r\nlegacy, and one that has ever been cherished with veneration for the\r\nmen who left it. He died a martyr to the cause he espoused, but his\r\nmemory and the cause live. The living blaze he and his co-workers, in\r\nthe cause of Irish freedom, kindled has never been completely stamped\r\nout, and it still smoulders, and has occasionally burst into flame\r\nonly to be temporarily extinguished in the blood and tears of our\r\nbravest and best who never forgot the teachings of Tone. And now, when\r\nthe sky is bright once more, and every circumstance portends the dawn\r\nof a new era, full of hope and promise for the ultimate realisation\r\nof those ideals for which thousands of our race have sacrificed their\r\nlives, the spark of nationality which, even since Tone's death, has\r\nrepeatedly leaped into flame, still glows fitfully to remind us that\r\ncome what may it remains undying and unquenchable, a beacon to light\r\nus on the path to freedom should disappointment and dashed hopes again\r\ndarken the outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abjuration, oath of, 51.\r\n  Absentees, 65, 138, 139.\r\n  Acton, Lord, 37.\r\n  Adrian, Pope, 13.\r\n  Agrarian outrages, 152, 196-202, 210-215.\r\n  Agriculture, Department of, 161, 163.\r\n  Alexander, Pope, 14.\r\n  Alfred the Great, 9.\r\n  American War of Independence, 63, 72, 73, 83.\r\n  Anglican Church in Ireland, 27, 28, 60, 143, 144, 236.\r\n  Anne, Queen, 63.\r\n  Arkins, P., 210, 211.\r\n  Arklow, battle of, 109.\r\n  Armagh, Bishop of, 7.\r\n  Ashbourne Act, 159.\r\n  Ashtown, Lord, 203, 204.\r\n  Asquith, Rt.
