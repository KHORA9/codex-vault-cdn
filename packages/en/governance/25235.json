Prior_, Esq;\r\n\r\nIn the Isles of St. _Patrick's_ Church,\r\n_Dublin, Oct. 9, 1753_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Mr. Dean, I am sorry to see you up, if any of your private\r\nAffairs disturb you. I came to call at your Grave, and have a little\r\nDiscourse with you; but unless 'tis the Publick has rouz'd you, I am\r\ntroubled to find you walking as well as my self.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. 'Tis my Country keeps me walking! why who can lie still? I don't\r\nbelieve there are many Ghosts now, that have any share of Understanding,\r\nor any regard for _Ireland_, that are to be found in their Graves at\r\nMidnight. For my part I can no more keep in my Den than if it were the\r\nDay of Judgment. I have been earth'd now eight Years last _October_,\r\nand I think on my Conscience (and you know _Tom_ the Conscience of one\r\ndead Man is worth ten of those that are living) I have had very few\r\ngood Days Sleep since I got there. Ah _Tom_! poor _Ireland_! poor\r\n_Ireland_! it plagued my Heart while I was trifling away Life there;\r\nbut my Curse on it, I never thought it would have broke my Rest thus\r\nwhen I was dead. I have tumbled and toss'd from one Side to the other\r\n(and by the by, they make these cursed Coffins so narrow 'tis a Plague\r\nto be in them) first one Thing would come into my Head, and then\r\nanother, and often wrought me so, that I have many a time been forced\r\nto walk a whole Moon to rest me and get the better Nap when I lay down.\r\nPrithee how have you done?\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why, very little better; only as I have not been so long shut up\r\nin my Dormitory as you, the Confinement is less irksome. But I was not\r\naffected the same way with you, for I sometimes slept for Months\r\ntogether like a Dormouse; but when _Ireland_ once gets into my Head and\r\nits present melancholy Circumstances, it works my Thoughts upwards and\r\ndownwards from the Great Ones to their Slaves, like a poor Patient with\r\n_Ward_'s Drop and Pill.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. That has often been my Case _Tom_. When I get into that Train of\r\nthinking, and consider the present Situation of our Country, it makes\r\nme as uneasy in my Coffin as a Rat shut up in a Trap. I remember an old\r\nShe[1] Fool, that was fonder of scribling than reigning, used to say,\r\nthat the Dead have that melancholy Advantage over the Living of first\r\nforgetting them; but 'tis as false as ten thousand other Truths, that\r\nyour Philosophers and Politicians above Ground keep such a babling with\r\nover our Heads. For my part I never had that Pleasure, for since my\r\nfirst Nap under my Gravestone, which did not last three Weeks, I have\r\nbeen as much perplex'd about _Ireland_, as if I was still living at the\r\nDeanry, writing for Posterity, and thinking for my poor Country. What\r\nmakes you sigh so _Tom_? Why you draw your Breath as hard as a\r\nbroken-winded Racer; some Qualm I suppose about this neglected Island.\r\n\r\n      [1] Queen _Christina_ of _Sweden_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. That was the Case indeed. But tho' I am chiefly grieved at the\r\nill Circumstances of _I----d_, my next trouble is, that the World seems\r\nresolved they shall never mend; and, I think so, by their treating all\r\ntrue Patriots in the most unhandsome Manner. This is as mad a Measure,\r\nas imprisoning the Physicians in an epidemical Sickness would be. Yet\r\nsuch Men, who only could heal our Distempers, are treated almost as\r\ncommon Poisoners, and watch'd as if they were Incendiaries and the\r\nEnemies of Society. It was too much our own Case when we were among\r\nMen, and tho' I scorn to lament the indifferent Treatment Dean _Swift_\r\nand _Tom Prior_ received from those who should have respected and\r\nhonoured them; yet I cannot help being concerned for the hard Usage all\r\ntrue Patriots generally meet with in _I----d_. Their Writings, tho'\r\never so disinterested are treated as so many mercenary Productions of\r\nthe Press; their Zeal and their Motives are ever suspected, as false\r\nand personated, and most Governments look on such Authors at best, as\r\nso many out-lying Deer, and give all the World leave to hunt them and\r\nrun them down. I am sure, as to my Particular, I may justly say, I\r\nfound it so; for, as I well knew, that writing with a Design to please\r\nor serve others, ends, generally, either in Neglect or Censure; so, I\r\nwould not have engaged in such a dangerous Undertaking, if I could have\r\nquieted my Heart, that was ever tempting me to despise the Danger for\r\nthe Hopes of doing good by my Pen.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I wish Tom the Tribe of Authors had ever writ from such a Turn\r\nof Mind, and then I fancy the World had not been so much over-run with\r\nBooks.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I can answer for my self that I had only the Service of my\r\nFellow Citizens in view. Let those whose miserable Aim is writing well,\r\nbe ashamed if they are criticiz'd, or ridiculed, but he who sincerely\r\nstrives to serve Millions, must have a Scorn for Malice or Satyr, if he\r\nthinks he can feed or cloath half a Nation by scribling. I profess I\r\nwrit whatever I publish'd, barely for the Joy I had in doing some\r\nService to my Country, and with so little a view to Reputation, that I\r\nwould have done it, if there had been no such thing as Fame in the\r\nWorld; and surely, there is almost as little of that phantastick\r\nPleasure to be had here as in the _Isle of Man_, or the _Orcades_. Nay,\r\nDean, I'll go further, I would have done it for the gratifying the\r\npleasing Instinct that lead me to it, if there had not been a great\r\nLord and Parent of Good to approve and reward it. Hence it was that I\r\ntroubled the World with a deal of Tracts on publick Subjects; and, I\r\nthank Heaven, my Heart is as little asham'd of it, now I am dead, as I\r\nwas proud of it when I was living, which is what few Authors can say\r\nwhen they are coffin'd. I saw writing absolutely necessary to the\r\nwell-being of the most neglected Nation under Heaven. I heard, I saw, I\r\nfelt the Displeasure of some great Men for several Things I wrote,\r\nwhich crost their Views, or even disagreed with their Opinions or\r\nDesires. I saw few either willing to appear Medlers or Busy-Bodies this\r\nWay; or visibly to hurt their worldly Interests, or to seem fond of\r\neither Ridicule or Reputation by bustling about it; and, as I was quite\r\nindifferent to those Fears, I hop'd what I did, and the Motives I went\r\non, might be pardonable if not approveable; and whatever was the Event,\r\nI as sincerely despised any Abuse I met with, as I did any Credit, that\r\na few solitary thinking Men might allow me for it.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Why, really _Tom_, as there is no lying in this World, that we\r\nare now launch'd into, I must own there is a great deal of Truth in all\r\nyou have said; and tho' I often writ for the Sake of Applause, yet\r\nwriting with such a View is a poor Motive, and the best and noblest,\r\nand I had almost said, the only justifiable one, is to do Good in an\r\nevil World. I don't see any Thing very desireable in the greatest\r\nTalents, or in the largest Affluence of Fortune, unless they are in\r\nsome Measure employed in the Publick Service, and if they be, it truly\r\ndignifies them; nay, that single View is enough to sanctify the poorest\r\nScribling, and to make the meanest scraping and saving of Avarice, pass\r\nfor the Marks of a worthy Spirit. But tho' Patriots are generally so\r\nill used, by the ungrateful World; you certainly came much better off\r\nthan I did, for where you met with one Reviler, I met with one hundred.\r\nThe Pamphlets wrote against me, wou'd have form'd a Library, or rather\r\na Dormitory, where they might have slept in undisturb'd Repose; instead\r\nof furnishing Grocers and Pastry Cooks for Years together, to make some\r\nexpiation for beggaring Printers and Booksellers. I have had Thousands\r\nwritten against me, with Virulence and Scandal.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. And what a wounding Grief must that be, to your generous Mind,\r\nto have so much Malice returned, where so much Gratitude was due;\r\nsurely it gave you infinite Pain to be so lash'd and stigmatised, by a\r\nRabble, of the most invenom'd and imbitter'd Scriblers upon Earth?\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Why, dear _Tom_, I cou'd laugh a Month at you for this. Why,\r\nthey made no more Impression on my Spirit, with their scurrilous\r\nPamphlets, than they wou'd have done, on my Statue, had they thrown\r\nthem at it. I ever consider'd, that Abuse from such Scriblers, who\r\nwrite for a Livelihood, can no more be thought an Affront, than a\r\nBarber's taking you by the Nose; 'tis his Trade, and the Wretch would\r\nstarve if you stopt him. What harm did all their Ribaldry do me? I\r\nneither eat, nor drunk, nor slept the worse for it. I don't suppose,\r\nthat the scape Goat, which the _Jews_ loaded with Curses, and drove\r\ninto the Wilderness, either died by their Maledictions, or grew a whit\r\nthe leaner for them; nor was I ever the worse for all I met with. Why\r\n_Tom_, one had as good be a sensitive Plant, as to start and fly back,\r\nat every Touch, or every Appearance of being Touch'd, as some weak Men\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. We may Reason thus, but Nature generally over masters our\r\nOpinions.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Yes, when they are of opposite Sides, but in this point they\r\nmust agree. Consider, what a wretched Thing would Merit be, whose chief\r\nsupport is a justly deserved good Character, if it depended for its\r\nreal Fame, on the Writings (if we must call them Writings) of envious\r\nScriblers, or the Tongues, of Slanderers, who wou'd both of them fain\r\nget a Scrap of Reputation, by vilifying exalted Names. No, _Tom_, there\r\nis something in true Merit, so independent of Applause and Censure, and\r\nso superior to the going out, or coming into Vogue, that it frequently\r\ntakes the Injuries of such Reptiles as a kind of Homage; like the\r\nAbuses offered by the common Soldiers, to Conquerors when they Ride in\r\nTriumph, and which they valued as little as the senseless Phrases and\r\nShouts of the multitude. 'Tis time enough for true Merit and Goodness\r\nto expect Justice from Men; when it receives the Euge of the\r\nOmnipotent; for then only will Malice be out of Countenance, Envy\r\nsilent, and then only will Truth (the Language of Eternity) prevail!\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Well, very well, Mr. _Dean_. But I am much mistaken, if you was\r\nnot heartily Sick of your Patriotism, when you was so often branded and\r\nasperst by such Crowds of Pamphlets and Scriblers.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Dr. _Tom_, they never gave me a moment's Pain, for the Truth is,\r\nI was too proud to be affronted, and had too high a Spirit to be\r\nhumbled, by such Insults, or else indeed I had met with Opportunities\r\nenough to make me pass my Time very uneasily. But in the next place\r\nthose who Writ against me, were mere toothless Animals, or at least a\r\nSort of _Irish_ Vipers, that tho' they lov'd to Bite, yet they wanted\r\nthe pungent Venom which gives the Torment. Many of their Tracts were\r\nthe poorest Productions that ever disgraced the Press; without Style,\r\nor Wit, or Sense, or Argument. I remember one of them, where both I,\r\nand the Subject he writ on, were equally ill-treated, begun like a\r\n_Hebrew_ Book at the wrong End, with an Apology for the Author's\r\ninability to handle such weighty Points as they deserved; and indeed\r\n_Tom_, that single Confession was the only Thing that look'd like Truth\r\nor Modesty in the whole Performance. How could I be affronted by such\r\nmiserable Efforts of Malice? and above all, if the natural elevation of\r\nmy Mind, had not enabled me to look down on them with Disdain, the\r\nDignity and usefulness of my Life, help'd me to smile on them as\r\nimpotent and harmless. I was so far from being mortified by their base\r\nrevilings, that I think, I wrote the better for them, and with higher\r\nSpirit, as a well mettled Horse moves the brisker for being lashed.\r\nBesides, as I often wrote for the service of the World; and the\r\nInterests of Mankind, I always appeared with every Advantage, that\r\nCandour, Honesty, and Courage, cou'd give me against Injustice,\r\nOppression, and Tyrany. I wrote for Truth and Reason, for Liberty, and\r\nthe Rights of my Country and Fellow-Subjects; and it gave me Joy, to\r\nsee the Minions of a Court, and the Slaves of Power, stare at the\r\ndextrous boldness of my Pen, as I fancy a Cuckold does at a Deer, when\r\nhe sees it cast its Horns.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why dear _Dean_, I will not oppose you too obstinately; but I am\r\nsure, you will not deny, that you were sufficiently mortified, with\r\nother Things, if you were not with the Sarcasms of your Rival Writers.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. What other Things pray?\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why your not being perferr'd, nor advanc'd in the Church.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I renounce it! I deny it! I lost nothing by not being preferred,\r\nbut an enlarged Power of doing Good; and the Day is coming (much sooner\r\nthan the Feeders on the Earth imagine) when I shall be allowed as\r\nfully, for the Good I would have done, as for that which I was able to\r\naccomplish. The Publick indeed lost many, and perhaps considerable\r\nAdvantages, and I some hearty Prayers, by that Disappointment; at the\r\nsame Time, I ever look'd on the Gain of Preferment with the noblest\r\nScorn: I hardly look'd with more on those that disgraced it, your\r\nA----s, and your B----s, your C----s, and your D----s. The truth is, I\r\nsaw in this same scurvy World, so many bad Men pass for good; so many\r\nFools for wise; so many Ignorants for Learned; and so many Knaves for\r\nhonest, and rewarded accordingly, that I was rather provok'd, than\r\nmortified. However, I never fretted, but rather diverted my Spleen,\r\nwith the World's fine Mistakes; and I enjoyed in _Petto_, that just\r\ndelight of a truely honest Mind, of either pitying, or contemning every\r\nworthless Animal, whose Advancement made him look down on me, with\r\nInsolence or Scorn.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. That was a peculiar felicity of Temper.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. It was so, and I enjoy'd it fully. If sometimes, I was weak\r\nenough to be angry at such Events, I took care, that my Ill-humour,\r\nshou'd be as useful to the Publick, as my good cou'd have been. I ever\r\ndespised undeserved Grandeur, and misapplied Power, and therefore few\r\nPeople in high Posts, or even Kings or Queens, or Ministers, cou'd ever\r\nbrag much of my Condescension, in speaking a good Word for them to\r\nPosterity, or endeavouring to blind the Eyes of the present Times, by\r\nPrinting either lies or Truths in their Favour. 'Tis true, I almost as\r\nseldom gave them any Proofs of my Spite; partly out of neglect, and a\r\ndespair of doing any good by it; but chiefly, as I rather chose\r\nquarrelling with my Equals, whom I cou'd safely treat as ill as they\r\nused me; for after all _Tom_, tho' a Man hates Lyons and Tygers, there\r\nis no great Wit or Wisdom in throwing Stones at them, and provoking the\r\nlordly Monsters, to try the strength of their Mouths, or their Fangs on\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I entirely agree with you there, Dean, but it is certain, if you\r\nwas not mortified, you was enraged at the ill Usage your Patriotism\r\ndrew on you from the Men in Power. This therefore, must have disturbed\r\nyour mind remarkably, and as I was observing at first had never given\r\nyou any uneasiness, had you been less zealous in your Country's\r\nService.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I shall chuse to say little to that; tho' probably had they used\r\nme more generously, both they and I had been better pleased. I know my\r\nFoes said, if I had not hated the Ministry so much, I had not lov'd\r\n_Ireland_ so well, nor fought her Battles so stoutly against a stupid\r\nWorld, and a juncto of Copper-Coiners, Oppressors and Tax-Gatherers.\r\nBut indeed, _Tom_, I scorn'd to write from such mean-interested Views\r\nand partial Ends; but I wrote because I lov'd Honour, Truth and\r\nLiberty, more than fifty _Irelands_. Nay, upon my Word, if I had liv'd\r\nthree Winters in _Lapland_, and found it as much opprest, I would have\r\nmade War with my Pen on the _Danes_, with the same Spirit, and attack\r\nthem for so basely distressing the Slaves that croucht to them, and\r\ndurst not on pain of Ruin howl under their Rods. I thank Heaven, I got\r\nthe better of the redoubted Sir _Robert_, in that important Affair; and\r\nif I had liv'd a little longer, and my Organs had not declined too\r\nfast, I would have kept all the great Bashaws of _Europe_ in my\r\nDependance as _Aretine_ did.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why, Dr. Dean, I was complaining of the hard Fate and ill Usage\r\ntrue Patriots meet with in the World, from its Neglects, if not from\r\nits Oppressions; and you stop my Mouth with Declamations of their Worth\r\nand their Influence, and make them the most formidable People in it.\r\nDon't you consider how easily they are crusht by Power.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. No! But I consider how easily they can crush Power, I mean\r\nabused Power, when they attack Oppression and plead for Liberty, and an\r\ninjured People. If I was to be restored to Life again (which Heaven\r\nforbid) and was in the Prime of my Parts and Spirits, I could overturn\r\nbad Ministers as easily with my Pen, as _Mahomet_ in his Alcoran says,\r\nthe Archangel _Gabriel_ did Mountains with the Feather of his Wing. An\r\nAuthor whose Writings are bottom'd on Truth, and influenced by no\r\nMotives but the sincere Love of his Country can do Wonders. As he Acts\r\nright he fears nothing; and if he be Opprest, his Sufferings do but\r\nexalt his Character and encrease his Strength as well as his Courage. I\r\never found this true by Experience, I never had more Spirit, more\r\nResolution, than when I was most eminently injured; nor did I ever\r\nexert my self in a more distinguished Manner than when the Interests of\r\ntwo Kingdoms were both at Work, and labouring by the help of a Villain\r\nin Scarlet Robes, to String me up as a Trumpeter of Rebellion. God\r\nforgive the Enemies of sincere Patriots, who make use of all their Arts\r\nand their Power to crush and oppress them; but tho' I pray for them, I\r\nmust own _Tom_, if Beggars, were to be chusers, I had rather they\r\nshould be forgiven after they had been severely punish'd for their\r\nmisdeeds, for otherwise, when Oppressors gall Men or Nations too long,\r\nProvidence bears half blame.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I shall submit to all you advance _Dean_, provided you quit this\r\nSubject, (which I unluckily started) and go to another, which I came to\r\ntalk about, and is of more Importance; I mean our poor Country, and its\r\npresent State and Circumstances; when I died, I thought I had left it\r\nin a very improving way, and on the mending hand, by my Writings and my\r\nconstant Labours in its Service, and had I liv'd a little longer, I\r\nwou'd have wrote some Tracts, that wou'd have prevented some\r\nDistresses, which I hear, are likely to fall heavy on her.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Dreams! Whims! and Delusions! If you had wrote your self as\r\nblind as _Milton_ did, what Service cou'd you do a Nation that never\r\nthinks. You might as well expect to cure the Deaf by talking to them;\r\nIdiots by reasoning with them; or to rouse the Dead as the _Romans_ did\r\nby bawling and weeping for their miserable Condition. If they had been\r\nretrievable by any Writings, I may justly say, they had been retrieved\r\nby mine.\r\n\r\n    _----Si Pergama dextra,\r\n    Defendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent._\r\n\r\nBut all such hopes are vain. Preach to Fishes and talk to Wolves like\r\nSt. _Anthony_ and St. _Francis_, and try what Change it will make in\r\nthem, and be assur'd, just so much and no more, would your Arguments\r\nand Eloquence do, with our heedless Countrymen. I told them of their\r\nDanger, and every impending Ruin in Print, Winter after Winter, as\r\nregularly as Men wish People a good Year, every first of _January_; for\r\nlet me tell you _Tom_, repetitions of this Sort, are as necessary in a\r\nNation, that will not readily mind good Advice, as crying Fire! Fire!\r\nin a City in Flames, where all are drunk or asleep, and must either\r\nrouse and bestir themselves, or Perish. I cannot help boasting a little\r\non this Subject, I have a Title to it; these Hands were almost as\r\nuseful to the People of _I----d_, as _Moses_'s were to the _Jews_: When\r\nI lifted them up, all went well; when I dropt them, all went wrong.\r\nHowever, I must own, that as to the bulk of the Nation, tho' I tried\r\nthem, and studied them, for half a Century, I ever found that they\r\nwou'd not be at the pain of thinking, for half an hour, to secure their\r\nease and happiness for half a Year. But, pray _Tom_, before you speak\r\nof the Distresses that menace _I----d_, let me hear what Grounds you\r\nhave to say, She was, in a tolerable improving way, and on the mending\r\nhand (as you call'd it) when you died. I have heard indeed, from the\r\nGhosts of some half-starved Silk-Weavers, and some Manufacturers of\r\n_Irish_ Woollen Goods, that died of Hunger and Poverty, that _I----d_\r\nwas vastly improv'd, as to Elegance of Taste, in her Gentry, as to\r\neating and drinking: That they understood Musick, infinitely better\r\nthan their Ancestors; that they drest vastly more agreeably than their\r\nstupid Grandmothers, and shew'd more good Sense in the nice choice of\r\ntheir Suits, and the Fancy and richness of their Cloaths, as well as\r\nthe modest way of imitating naked _Eve_, in wearing them, than the last\r\nAge did. I was assured also, that they danced inconceivably finer than\r\never; that their Races, and their Subscriptions for them, quite surpast\r\nall Imagination; and that they gam'd deeper, and lost their Guineas\r\nwith more ease and politeness, even to Strangers and Sharpers, than\r\ntheir Fathers did their Shillings to one another. As to any other\r\nImprovements, and particularly as to Learning, Virtue, or Piety, (which\r\nprobably were over-look'd in the Account) they poor famish'd Devils,\r\ncou'd tell me nothing of them.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. You are very merry _Dean_ with the madness of our Countrymen,\r\nbut I fear by and by, I shall hear another Story, and be as melancholy\r\nwith their Miseries. However, as you desire it, I shall give you a fair\r\nAccount what these Improvements were, which made me think our poor\r\nCountry was in a tolerable Way. And in the first Place, I shall mention\r\nour numerous and extended Turnpikes, which have been carried on with\r\nincredible Application and surprizing Expence in all Parts, and I had\r\nalmost said, brought to every Town, of the least Name, or Consequence\r\nin the Kingdom. Of what infinite Advantage this must prove to the Ease\r\nand Convenience of all Travellers, to the facilitating and promoting\r\nour inland Commerce, and the general Service of Trade, I need not tell\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Ah, _Tom_, I know very well, if _I----d_ had almost as many high\r\nWays in it as the Ocean, what Advantages it would produce to us. This\r\nwas one of the great Arts of the ancient _Romans_, who had prodigious\r\nRoads running thro' every Province, in a strait Line to the Capital of\r\nthe Empire. But Alas! We copy them in our boasted Causeways, as we do\r\nin our Standing Armies, without having any real Business for either of\r\nthem. I will for some Time, at least, drop the delicate Subject of our\r\nTroops; but as to the other Point, I must say, I think it is a Curse\r\nupon us, that we can't even copy a good Example (for bad Ones we do\r\nmore adroitly) but we do it in a tricky dirty Manner, and with as many\r\nDeviations as we can. Why, dost thou not know, _Tom_, what base filthy\r\nJobs, Knaves, and Mean-foul'd Wretches have made, and do still make of\r\nthese magnified Turnpikes. I was once fix'd to write a Book of all the\r\nCheats, and all the Reptiles, of what Quality or Station soever\r\nconcern'd in them, but I found it would be so voluminous, that I left\r\nthe Care of it to Posterity, as one of the largest Branches of _Irish_\r\nHistory, and Wisdom. But to dwell as little on such melancholy\r\nDisgraces of our Country, as I can, I will chuse only to hint to you,\r\nthat fine Roads, without Travellers, and Stage-Coaches, without\r\nPassengers, are useless Things, that must soon be dropt; and without\r\nManufactures, and proper Employment to set us at Work, can neither be\r\nfor Use or Pleasure. Indeed, if we had Trade, and the Roads were fairly\r\nfinish'd, they might help it; but in the mean Time, methinks we are in\r\nhis Case, who built the Mill, without knowing whence to bring Water to\r\nit, or where to procure Grist for it. Nay, to make bad worse, after so\r\nmany Acts for Turnpikes, you cannot but know, _Tom_, that we want one\r\ngeneral Act to make them all passable. I am loth to be too severe on\r\nthem, and those who make Pence by spoiling them; and therefore I will\r\nonly say, passable for Footmen at least; for as to Carriages, if they\r\nare allowed to be driven on some of these Roads, they will be the utter\r\nRuin of each other. But as I am quite sick of this, prithee _Tom_, let\r\nus go to some other Improvements of _Ireland_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why, the next I shall mention is one, which you cannot easily\r\ntalk me out of, and that is, our prodigious Number of Converts; which,\r\nconsidering the Prejudices of a bigotted People, (envassaled to _Rome_,\r\nand Superstition) exceeds all Belief. It is a Matter of the highest\r\nConsequence to our Welfare, that we have so astonishing a Crowd of all\r\nRanks, Fortunes, and Circumstances that have come over to our Church,\r\nwho were formerly our inveterate Enemies, and are now perfectly united\r\nto us, both in our religious and political Interests: This is not only\r\na great discomfort, and weakening to the Popish Party, but a\r\nconsiderable Encouragement and Strength, to all who wish well to the\r\nProtestant Religion in _Ireland_. As the Papists are now quite\r\ndepriv'd, of all Men of Fortune, Family or Character, that were capable\r\nof heading their Attempts, or forming their Schemes of any Sort; I have\r\never look'd on this Affair of our numerous Converts, as likely to\r\ncontribute emnently to the Peace and Prosperity of this Island. By this\r\nmeans, those spiritual Factions, which have often produced such fatal\r\nEffects here, by Rebellions and national Massacres, will be utterly\r\nextinguished, and both Conformists, Dissenters and Papists, will in a\r\nlittle Time, live in as much Harmony and Good-Humour together; as if\r\nour Statesmen had learn'd the Art of Father _Boubours_'s Friend, who he\r\ntells us, had taught a Dog, a Cat, and a Mouse, to eat quietly\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. The Dissenters live in Harmony and good Humour! What, _Tom_,\r\ncannot even the Grave open your Eyes; as to those Favourites of yours,\r\nthe Dissenters, after all the Pranks they have been playing of late, as\r\nif they had a mind to make good, all I ever writ against them: But keep\r\nyour old kind Opinion of them, _Tom_, to your self, for I shall not\r\ndispute on it now, because a few Years, and a few Facts, will shew you\r\nfully what they drive at, and so to that great Explainer Time, I leave\r\nthem, unless you start the Subject hereafter. As to our Converts which\r\nare our present Topick, I shall only say, when you consider how they\r\nmanage, whose Interests they espouse, and who they herd with, you will\r\nnot be too ready to vouch for their Sincerity, or build on their\r\nFriendship, especially when their Conversion is brought about, by\r\nworldly Interests, and securing their Estates. They remember, I fancy\r\nthe Advice of _Alexander_ the Great to the _Athenians_, who refused to\r\nown him for a God:\r\n\r\n    [2]_Videte Athenienses ne dum Coelum custodiatis, Terram amittatis_,\r\n\r\nand therefore they take Care, not to sacrifice their Lands and\r\nTenements, to Opinions that are equally inconsistent and inconvenient.\r\nAs for the Story of Father _Boubours_'s Friend, I shall only answer it,\r\nwith one of Father Henepius, who was a very honest Missionary, and had\r\nmade some Converts among the _Indian_ Savages. In the small Number of\r\nthose he had brought over, he met with an old Woman, whom he had taken\r\nso much pains in instructing, that at last he had thoroughly convinc'd\r\nher; and having admitted his new Christian to Baptism, he made her a\r\npresent (and a very agreeable one to the Savages) of a Pound of\r\nTobacco: In a few Weeks, (after behaving very well) this old Woman\r\ncomes to Father _Henepin_, and tells him her Tobacco was gone, and begs\r\nof all Love, he wou'd give her another Pound, and she wou'd then\r\nconsent to be Christned anew. I will make no Application, _Tom_, but if\r\nany of your _Irish_ Conversions, seem to bear some Resemblance with\r\nthis, as to their Motives and Conduct, I think you need not boast much\r\nof any Advantages, to be deriv'd from them.\r\n\r\n      [2] _Look to it_ Athenians, _lest whilst you guard Heaven too\r\n      closely you should lose your Lands._\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I look on our Converts in a very different Light; Numbers of\r\nthem are unquestionably sincere; and if any of them may be justly\r\nsuspected, I am sure their Children, and Grand-Children; will be\r\nactually as good Protestants, as any in _England_, where a few\r\nGenerations ago, all were bigotted Slaves to _Rome_ and Popery. Upon\r\nthis Footing it is, that I will also reckon up to you, our Charter\r\nworking Schools, as another great Improvement in _I----d_, and which\r\ngave me great Hopes of our drawing prodigious Advantages from them. The\r\n_Janizaries_, who are Sons of Christians taken Captives in their\r\nInfancy, are not a greater Strength to the _Turks_, or a greater\r\nweakening to their Enemies, than these Children, will be to our Church\r\nand Kingdom. This is the Surest, and safest Method of striking at the\r\nRoot of the Popish Party, in our divided Country; and will secretly and\r\nwithout Noise or Violence, or the Terror of Penal Laws, sap and\r\nundermine their great Support their Numbers, and that old partition\r\nWall of the _Irish_ Tribes, and the _English_ Families, and make us in\r\nTime but one People. There are few Counties in the Kingdom, that have\r\nnot one, or more, Charter Schools establish'd in them; and as the\r\nChildren, I am told, are computed to near fifteen Hundred, and will\r\nprobably in a few Years, amount to double that Number, I cannot but\r\nhope to see great Effects from this happy Institution.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Why truly, _Tom_, in three or four Centuries, something may be\r\ndone; but Schools and Children are as slow a way of working, as sowing\r\nAcorns, in order to raise Forests, for building Fleets and Cities.\r\nBesides, the Funds allowed this noble Design, are so small, as if they\r\nwere subscrib'd by Papists, in order to cramp it, and lessen its\r\nEfficacy; whereas the Contributions ought to be as extended as its\r\nViews, and suited to the removal of our great national Defect, our\r\nreligious Differences. Neither ought such an important Scheme, to be\r\nleft depending on Fits of good Humour, and the Yearnings of Charity,\r\nwhich are influenced so much by the Variations of popular Opinion, and\r\nChanges of Weather, and Times, and Seasons. Withall I must tell you,\r\n_Tom_, that the whole Body of the Popish Clergy, have been so violent\r\nin opposing it, by denying the Communion and Absolution, to all their\r\nMembers, that send Children to such Schools, and cursing it and them,\r\nwith Bell, Book, and Candle, in all their Congregations, that I\r\napprehend it will be yet harder, to get Children to fill the Schools,\r\nthan even a Fund to maintain them there.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. It must be owned the popish Clergy have done their utmost, to\r\ndiscredit and overturn this Design. This however, is a stronger Proof\r\nof the exceeding Usefulness of it, than of their Prudence in thwarting\r\nit so violently, as they confessedly have done. However, as this is a\r\nScheme which his Majesty has so generously, and so warmly espoused, I\r\nam the more inclined to believe, that from his Royal Protection, it\r\nwill probably operate more expeditiously, than you imagine: And if\r\nthese wise Priests will consider, that if they go on to undermine these\r\nPlans of their Governors, it may force them to blow up at once, their\r\nwhole Church Government, and oblige all Priests, on pain of High\r\nTreason, to take out all their Titles from the King, or Protestant\r\nBishops only, it may make them more cautious and moderate in their\r\nmighty Zeal. A Priest in _Ireland_, shou'd be as quiet, and as passive,\r\nas a Protestant Minister in _France_; and if once they are so, we shall\r\nsoon find our Charter Schools more crowded than their Mass Houses, and\r\ntheir Parents, as manageable as their Children.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I am afraid their fixt Opposition to our Government may produce\r\nsome wholesome Statutes to curb their ill-judg'd Zeal; but if they\r\nbehave with Decency, and a due Submission to the Laws and the\r\nGovernment, I shou'd be sorry to see any Severities thought necessary.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. So shou'd I, and probably their own Prudence and Moderation may\r\nprevent it; and to that we may leave it. In short, dear _Dean_, 'tis as\r\neasy removing this Evil, as drawing a loose Tooth, if it gives us no\r\nPain, there it may stay 'till it rots; if it does Pain us, and severely\r\ntoo, out it must go, and let those who give the Pain look to it. But I\r\nwill drop this Subject, and go on to another considerable Improvement,\r\nthat has of late Years been carried on with particular Emulation and\r\nSuccess, and that is, the surprising Improvement in the Breed of both\r\nour black Cattle, and our Horses. The first of these, we have taken\r\nuncommon Care about, by Importing great Numbers of the finest Bulls and\r\nHeifers, from _England_. It is true, the fatal Disease, that infected\r\nmost of the horned Beasts for some Years past in _Great Britain_,\r\nforc'd us to suspend our Importations of them for some Time; but\r\nnevertheless, I will be bold to say, there are but few breeding\r\nCounties, on the other Side of the Water, which produce Cattle that\r\nexcell those, which are bred by a vast many of our Gentlemen, either as\r\nto Beauty, Size, Leather, or Milk.\r\n\r\nAs to our Horses, it is confest by the best Judges, that by bringing\r\nover the noblest Stallions, and the highest bred Mares, we may boast of\r\nhaving raised the Character of both our Racers and Hunters to a\r\nsurprizing Degree. We send over great Numbers every Year abroad and I\r\nam assured, that in the _French_ King's Stables, they make as great a\r\nFigure, and are as much esteemed, as those of any Country in _Europe_,\r\nif we except _Great Britain_. Our Nobility and Gentry, are so\r\npassionately fond of keeping fine Studs, and the highest priced Cattle\r\nFor Blood and Performance, that if they go on, as they have hitherto\r\ndone, to lay out such large Sums in indulging this Humour, we may in\r\nTime expect to pay Part of the dreadful Importation of _French_ Claret,\r\nby our _Irish_ Horses.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I wonder you don't brag of our Importing Jack-Asses, and\r\nbreeding Mules here, among your other mighty Nothings you boast of so\r\nmagnificently. For my part, _Tom_, I see no great Advantage to the\r\nService of _Ireland_, that a few private Gentlemen have improv'd the\r\nBreed of the horned Cattle. You may as well argue, that some of our\r\n_Irish_ Senators marrying a few celebrated Toasts for their Beauty,\r\nwou'd improve the natural homeliness of the Commonality.\r\n\r\nIndeed the Improvement made in the Breed of our _Irish_ Horses, I\r\nbelieve will grow very general, and have more enlarged Consequences,\r\namong our People, as Racing favours some of their darling Passions,\r\ntheir Indolence and Idleness, Gaming and Drinking, and the helping our\r\nFox-Hunters off, with their Time and their Fortunes, which I ever\r\nthought, two of the greatest Burdens to our _Irish_ Gentlemen in the\r\nWorld. If they wou'd turn themselves, to breed Cattle to mount our\r\nTroops, or draw our Carriages, they might indeed save us 5000_l._ a\r\nYear, and do something truly beneficial to our Country; but, _Tom_,\r\nthey have Souls above the little Views of being useful, and managing\r\ntheir Expences, and keeping our Cash in the Kingdom, are low Arts and\r\nTricks, fitter for the mean Notions of a Merchant or a Mechanick, than\r\nMen of Fortune and Family, that are as proud and as thoughtless as so\r\nmany noble _Spaniards_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Well, _Dean_, in spite of all your Objections, I think I have\r\nnam'd several considerable Improvements, in our poor Country, which\r\ngave me Reason to say, she was on the mending Hand; and I have not\r\nnam'd all, for the very encrease of our Numbers of late Years, is a\r\nvast Addition to our Strength, Credit, and Figure, as a Nation. I think\r\nthe Dealers in Political Arithmetick, compute that every Nation,\r\nunwasted by Famines, Wars, or Plagues, doubles the Quantity of its\r\nPeople in 250 Years; but I have seen Computations, that between our\r\nearly Marriages, the Breedyness of our People, the Importations of our\r\nNeighbours, the Mildness of our Climate, and the Fertility of our Soil,\r\nevidently prove, that we have frequently doubled the Amount of our\r\nInhabitants in half that Time. The Truth is, the matter of Fact is so\r\nincontestable, that I need not recollect all the Proofs, on which they\r\nground their Assertion; but I shall only observe to you, _Dean_, that\r\nthis is a very singular Advantage, since it is certain, that we out\r\nbreed the _Jews_, and in spite of our Wars and Massacres, we seem to\r\nmultiply like the _Polypus_, by being cut to Pieces.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Stuff and Nonsense! To tell me of our Numbers, when they only\r\nserve to multiply our Wretchedness and Miseries: Does this prove us on\r\nthe mending Hand, as you term it? Why you talk like a Physician, that\r\nwanted more Fees for doing nothing! 'Tis hard, _Tom_, you cannot be in\r\nthe Right sometimes, and speak Truth now and then. Did ever Man before\r\nyou boast of having Crowds of Beggars? And what are we else? For I\r\nverily think, tho' Sir _William Petty_ says, Nature never design'd\r\nabove one in 500 to beg by forcing them on the Charity of others,\r\n(thro' some Lameness, Crookedness, or other accidental Debility, that\r\nincapacitates them to Labour) that in _Ireland_ one in seventy are\r\nBeggars, (at least for the Summer Season,) and sixty of the Remainder\r\nincapable of relieving them, thro' their own Distresses. All the\r\nAdvantages we have thro' the encrease of our Inhabitants, is, that for\r\nwant of being employ'd, they furnish us with Thieves, Pilferers and\r\nSharpers, private Wenches, and common Whores, Cheats and Robbers,\r\nPickpockets, Gamesters, Tinkers and Vagabonds. We get also by this\r\nblessed means some Foundlings for our Hospitals, and Brats for our\r\nCharter Schools, Shoe-boys, and News Criers, and when they're grown up,\r\nRecruits for the holy Convents and Nunneries, and the wise and reverend\r\nBody of the Popish Priests. We have also the Advantage of able bodied\r\nVolunteers, for the Armies of our dear Allies the _French_; Shoals of\r\nTransports, that escape from the Gallows, to the Plantations abroad,\r\nand a superfetation of Felons, to give a little Business to our Judges,\r\nJustices, and Hangmen at home, and to keep up an Appearance of our\r\nbeing govern'd like other Nations. How many Thousands do we see, take\r\ntheir flight abroad every Year, like Birds of Passage, to search for\r\nFood and Subsistance in other Countries? How many Thousands never\r\nreturn again to us, no more than Prisoners to their Confinement, when\r\nthey've broke loose from their hard Fare, and their Fetters. I do not\r\nexaggerate in the least; our Numbers, till we can give them Business at\r\nhome, are as much a Curse and a Burthen as too large a Garrison in a\r\nbesieged Town that wants Provisions: If, as political Writers agree,\r\nthe true Interests of any Country consists in the Prosperity not of\r\nsome, but of all the People in it, then I am sure _Ireland_, with her\r\nboasted Numbers, is in a bad way; as all her poor Popish Natives, or in\r\nother Words, three-fourths of her swarming Inhabitants, have neither\r\nHouses, Cloaths, Work, Food, or Fire. This is a dismal self-evident\r\nTruth, that demands the serious Consideration of every Irishman, that\r\ncan think, or can learn to think. At the same Time, our Nobility and\r\nGentry set their Lands excessively high, get their Rents paid to a\r\nPenny, have as little fear of Wars or Taxes as of Famines, and live as\r\nwell (rambling, and squandering their Fortunes all over the World) as\r\nany People whatever, without one uneasy Thought, as to the\r\nCircumstances of those Crowds of their Countrymen that are starving\r\nhere. The Truth is, few Men are sick of other People's Ailments; and as\r\nthese honest Gentlemen find themselves quite at Ease, they can't think\r\nothers are in Misery. It puts me in mind, _Tom_, of the famous _La\r\nBruyere_'s Account of a great Statesman in _France_, who sign'd an\r\nArret, that wou'd have starv'd some Millions of People; however, says\r\nhe, in his sarcastical way, he is to be excused, for how cou'd he, with\r\nhis Stomach full of Meat, and his Head fuming with Wine, have any\r\nnotion of a whole Province perishing with Hunger? In other Countries,\r\nwhere some Care is taken to employ their Hands, and secure them\r\nNecessaries of Life, within the reach of their Labour, their Numbers\r\nare their Strength and their Happiness; but here where nobody thinks\r\nfor us, and we are too sottish or desperate to think for ourselves; our\r\nNumbers only increase our Misfortunes, like Lice on a diseased and\r\nfamish'd Beggar. Our common _Irish_ are cloathed with Rags, that wou'd\r\ndisgrace a Dunghill in _Holland_; they live five Months in the Year\r\nwithout Food, unless you will call Potatoes and Salt by that Name; nay,\r\nthey live without Houses, unless Holes twice as big, and twice as\r\ndirty, as an _English_ Hogsty, deserve that Title, which they Build\r\ntoo, just for a Year, as Birds build their Nests, and then away to\r\nanother Place in the Spring. And to brag of our Numbers, in such\r\ndeplorable Circumstances, is just as rational, as for a Miller to brag\r\nof having Thousands of Rats in his Mill, tho' they are starving and\r\nthieving, and ready to eat up one another, for a little more Room and\r\nPlunder.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Dear _Dean_, you are too severe, and have too imbitter'd a way\r\nof Speeching, on all Things relating to _Ireland_. I reckon the\r\nencrease of our Hands the greater Blessing, as the advancement of our\r\nLinen Business is likely in some Years, to find Employment for Crowds\r\nof our People; and consequently to give them all the Conveniences, as\r\nwell as the Necessaries of Life, in a reasonable Plenty: The prodigious\r\nProgress which this useful Manufacture, had made among us, was also\r\nanother Reason for my saying, I left _Ireland_ on the Recovery, when I\r\nwas call'd Home: It generally encreases about 20,000 _l._ per Ann. on\r\nan Average; and begins to spread so very fast in _Leinster_,\r\n_Connaught_ and _Munster_, that in a little Time we may hope to see\r\nmany Thousands of Families, which are now famishing, easy in their\r\nCircumstances, and useful to their Country. We begin to be convinced,\r\nthat our chief view herein must be to increase the Number of Acres\r\nsowed with Flax-Seed, and the Spinners who Manufacture it; for if these\r\nwere doubled (and with Care and Time they will be doubled) they wou'd\r\nsoon enrich us, and employ many Hands, that are now a Burthen to us.\r\n'Tis certain there is not by the fairest Computation, over the\r\nfifteenth Part of our People employ'd at present in this Business; and\r\nit ought to be our great Care, to have as many busied this way, in the\r\nother three Provinces, as there are in _Ulster_. Twenty Thousand Acres\r\nof Flax will furnish us with Materials enough, to keep an eighth part\r\nof our People employ'd; and as we neither want Ground enough to supply\r\nus with sufficient Quantities of excellent Flax, nor Hands to work it\r\nup, if we wou'd use them; there is little doubt, but by proper Laws, if\r\nwe can get them, and well judg'd Premiums, if we are allowed them, we\r\nshall soon see this blessed Affair establish'd. There is no danger of\r\ngrowing too large a Quantity of Flax, or of manufacturing too large a\r\nStock of Linen; the demand for them is so considerable already, and\r\nwill encrease every Day, with our Skill and Industry in the\r\nManufacture; and if we enlarge the Sallaries of our Lappers, and\r\nthereby secure the Credit of their Seals, it is probable, we shall\r\noutwork, and under sell all our Rivals.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. A very fine and a very plausible Account of Things; but do you\r\nknow, _Tom_, of no Objection against this promising Calculation of\r\nyours? Are there no Fears to ballance these growing Hopes, and mighty\r\nProspects?\r\n\r\nPRIOR. None that I know of, Mr. _Dean_. I have exaggerated nothing, but\r\ncandidly represented the true State of this Manufacture; nay I ought to\r\nhave added to it, the flourishing State of our Cambricks in _Ulster_,\r\nand particularly at _Dundalk_; where we have as happy an Example set us\r\nin the North, as a certain Baronet, and Friend of mine, has given us in\r\nthe South; what our Nobility and Gentry can do to help us, when they\r\nEmploy an enlarged Fortune, and an improv'd Understanding, in advancing\r\nour Manufactures, and labouring to enrich and enliven our Country. I\r\nmight justly have brought in also, the reasonable Hopes we have, that\r\nour Hempen Manufactures, may in a few Years, be so assisted, as to\r\nenable us to give Wings to the Navy of _Great Britain_, and Shirts to\r\nher Seamen; to her great saving, and our equal Gain and Honour. By this\r\nmeans, the rich Lands in _Munster_ and _Connaught_, may be as happily\r\nemploy'd, as the less fertile Fields, in the North; and have no Reason\r\nto Envy the superior Industry and Wealth of their Neighbours: And then\r\nour Women, (who used to be the most useless Members of our Country,\r\nbefore they distinguish'd themselves in our Linen Business,) wou'd have\r\na new Opportunity given them, to shew themselves the best, and the most\r\nindustrious Creatures in it.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I think, _Tom_, we may spare our Compliments to the Women, now\r\nwe are dead, who paid so little Regard to them while we were living.\r\nBut to pass by that, I must tell you, I have let you go on a long\r\nwhile, without contradicting you on this favourite Article, which I\r\nalways think on with satisfaction, as it is the staple Commodity of\r\nthis Island, and the chief Support of our Poor. But you shou'd act the\r\nPart of one of those faithful Lappers you were talking of, and put the\r\nworst part of their Cloth Manufacture outmost, and then Matters wou'd\r\nwear a very different Aspect. Do you consider what a dangerous Rival\r\n_Scotland_ has been, and is likely more and more every Day to prove, to\r\nthis miserable Country; and with how much ease she may exert her\r\nJealousy against us, to the cramping, or possibly, to the blasting all\r\nour Hopes. Do you reflect, how she may reduce you to the precarious\r\nDependance of sending over every Sessions a Linen Bill; and to hold the\r\nvery Subsistance of our Manufactures, or in other Words, the Life of\r\n_Ireland_, by her sole Will and Pleasure.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I have often heard this Objection started, but never thought\r\nthere was Danger enough in it to deserve an Answer, because I am\r\nconvinced, it is equally false and absurd. _Great Britain_ knows and\r\nfeels, that the improving these Manufactures here, is of vast Service\r\nto her, as it weakens her Enemies, and strengthens her Friends; and\r\nthat all she pays us with one Hand, is quickly repaid by us into the\r\nother. _Scotland_ also knows, that there is a vast demand for all the\r\nLinens she and _Ireland_ can work up; and that _England_ alone consumes\r\nabove the Value of a Million, imported by Foreigners, more than she and\r\n_Ireland_ can supply her with: She knows therefore, that there is no\r\nCause for Rivalship, and if there was, she wou'd exert herself to\r\ndiscourage the Manufactures of Foreigners, before she wou'd attempt to\r\nruin a Sister Nation, so closely united to her in the great Cause of\r\nReligion and Liberty, and all the weighty Interests that tie Nations\r\ntogether. This is so evedent, so sacred a Truth, that I am so far from\r\nbeing jealous of Opposition and Rivalship from that Quarter, that I am\r\nconfident of all that Assistance and Encouragement to our Linens, which\r\nhas been so often promised from _Great Britain_, and made good to us,\r\nby the repeated Orders of our Kings; and not only by the Speeches of\r\nour Lords Lieutenants, but by the most useful Laws from the Throne.\r\nNay, I doubt not, if by any evil Arts of our Enemies, any distress or\r\nobstruction, should hereafter be procured to our Manufacturers; we\r\nshou'd find on a candid Complaint of our Injury, an immediate Redress\r\nfrom that honest Spirit, which ever regulates the _English_ Councils,\r\nand makes them detest tricky Politicks, as much as open Oppression, and\r\nhas ever inspired them with a noble Zeal, to assist and protect the\r\nrighteous Cause of Truth, Industry and Liberty.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. It may be so! very likely--but possibly, _Tom_, her aid might\r\ncome too late for our Misery; and we might cry out, like the poor\r\n_Roman_ Knight _Lancia_, who bawl'd out for help, when the Pile he was\r\nlaid on, was all in Flames, and his Friends could do him no Service.\r\nBesides, _Tom_, not to mention that your rising Manufacture fell last\r\nYear 132,000 _l._ Have you not heard how your last Linen Bill, was so\r\nmiserably mutilated, that it was forc'd to be dropt; and that the\r\nNation was fobb'd off with a senseless Tale of a sleepy heedless Clerk;\r\nwhich if you have not heard, I can give you a full Account of.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. There is no Occasion, for I am quite convinced there was no such\r\nDesign. Do you think it possible, that Men of high Characters for\r\nHonour and Candour, Justice and Integrity, cou'd sport in so infamous a\r\nManner with the Fate of Nations, and the very Bread and Being of a\r\nfree, a brave, and a loyal People? Can you suppose, such a Personage as\r\nwas then watching over our Welfare, wou'd from an universal Reputation,\r\nfor every great and good Quality, turn in an instant to a barbarous\r\n_Caligula_, and Wish to cut off a whole Kingdom at a Blow? Absurd and\r\nimpossible! 'Tis not only reflecting on our Governors, basely and\r\nfalsely; but in some Measure on the best of Princes too; since it is\r\nimpossible we cou'd be subtily and insidiously betray'd by the one,\r\nwithout being secretly doom'd to Ruin by the other. Now this, Mr.\r\n_Dean_, is a Conduct so utterly opposite to his royal Nature and\r\nCharacter, who now gives Glory to the _British_ Throne; that I am\r\npersuaded, he is incapable of acting so to his most perfidious Enemies,\r\nand much less to the most zealous and faithful Subjects in the World.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Well, well, _Tom_, 'tis no Time for us to be quarrelling about\r\nReports and Stories. But now you have done with whitening the\r\nSepulchres of _Ireland_, give me leave to shew you honestly, and\r\nwithout Flattery, the Dirt and Stench, the Corruption and Rottenness\r\nthat lurks within. Now,\r\n\r\n    _Audi alteram Partam._\r\n\r\nI will shew You----\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Hear me out first, for I am so far from having done, that I have\r\nnot yet even touch'd on all the Advantages that our Country has\r\nreceived, from the _Dublin_ Society's Premiums; which was one of my\r\nchief Reasons, for having consider'd _Ireland_ as upon the Recovery,\r\nwhen I went under-ground like a Tortoise, to be raised again when the\r\nSummer comes, after a long Sleep. I need not be very particular on so\r\nknown and confest a Fact, as the extraordinary Improvements they have\r\nmade amongst us, in a vast Variety of Articles. We are told _Solomon_'s\r\nWritings were so extensive, that he wrote from the Cedar of _Lebanon_,\r\nto the Hyssop that groweth from the Wall; and really their Labours have\r\ntaken in every Material, every Manufacture, and every Improvement of\r\neither of them, that had any claim to their Attention or Encouragement.\r\nWe may say of their Funds, as _Laertes_ does in _Hamlet_, 'as for my\r\nMeans, I'll husband them so well, they shall go far with little;' and\r\nit is certain there never was so much done, with so poor an Income, to\r\nremedy all our natural Indisposition, to Labour, and Thought, and\r\nIndustry; to rouse up Thousands who were asleep, and set Numbers on\r\ncontriving and working, who were dreaming and idling before; and to\r\nstop our People from runing abroad, by Wages and Business, and an hope\r\nof living to purpose at Home. They gave Premiums, to heighten the\r\nManufacture and Dying of our Woollen Cloths; of our Silks, and our\r\nVelvets; of our Blankets; of our Worsteds; of our Cottons; of our\r\nCoffoys; Buffs, Lutherines and, Fustians; of our Stockings, and our\r\nCarpets, with surprising Success: In our Husbandry they did Wonders\r\nalso; as to Wheat and Barley; as to Liming, Marling, and Sanding of\r\nLand; as to planting of Hops, draining of Bogs; as to raising\r\nLiquorish, Saffron and Madder; and as to sowing of Turneps, Clover, St.\r\nFoil, Trefoil, and all Kinds of Grass Seeds. They improv'd by a well\r\njudged Emulation and proper Rewards, Numbers of our Husbandry Utensils:\r\nThey set the Nation at Work, in Planting amazing Quantities of Timber\r\nTrees, Willows and Osiers for Hop Poles; in raising great Numbers of\r\nOrchards, and improving our making of Cyder, home made Wines, and\r\nMetheglins; as also in Brewing our Ale and Beer, and giving us Vinegar\r\nfrom our own Fruits, equal to the best in _France_. They raised the\r\nManufactures of our finest Hats, to a surprising Degree; and they did\r\nthe same by our Window Glass, and made so great a Progress in our Paper\r\nBusiness, and building of Mills for carrying it on, as if they had got\r\nthe Mines of _Peru_, or the Industry of _China_, to assist them in\r\ntheir Undertakings.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Well, dear _Tom_, I suppose you have done now. I have finish'd a\r\nSermon, on a better Subject twice as soon, and yet tir'd my People, God\r\nhelp them, before I had half done.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I see you don't relish the Transports of my Zeal on this\r\nSubject, which gives me such high Delight; so I shall mention but\r\ncursorily many Articles that remain, and shall pass by a Crowd in\r\nSilence, that well deserv'd my dwelling on them: What I shall begin the\r\nremaining part of my Catalogue with, is their exerting themselves with\r\nsuch Assiduity and Success; in Teaching young Lads to Draw and Design\r\nskilfully; in setting up Competitions for the best Delf, Roan and\r\nCrockery Ware, for Erecting the best Glass Bottle-Houses, for raising\r\nof Mulberry Trees, for making of Salt, for working the best Bone-Lace,\r\nand the best Imitation of it by the Needle: For the Encouragement of\r\nthe best Needle-Works in Silk and Worsted; for the Advancement of those\r\nlovely Arts Painting, Architecture and Sculpture; for encouraging\r\nTapestry, and enlarging our Fisheries: For improving the Tanning and\r\nCurrying of our Leather, for the Discovery of Mines and raising of\r\nOres, and for those who should annually Produce the best Invention in\r\nuseful Arts and Husbandry. In a Word, by turning themselves every way,\r\nand applying their little Fund in different Years, to different Uses\r\nand Subjects, they seem'd not only to Influence, but even to animate\r\nthe Whole of our Country; to fire our Hearts, to enlighten our Minds,\r\nand stir and strengthen our Hands; and by giving a new Turn to our\r\nThoughts and Motions, to prepare us for yet greater Scenes of Industry,\r\nwhen larger Helps cou'd be got to excite us to it. They have shewn us\r\nthe vast Effects of a well directed Emulation, and what a few hundred\r\nannual Pounds, have already done, and can produce hereafter, by the\r\nhonest Oeconomy and prudential Directions, of a zealous and judicious\r\nBody of Citizens, who Study the Good of their Country. They have also\r\nshewn us another undisputed Truth, _viz._ That if their Fund was\r\nenlarg'd, the Good they wou'd do wou'd be proportionably encreased with\r\nit, and that little Wonders might be wrought in _Ireland_, by\r\nenlivening the Arts, by Feeding the Hungry, by giving Feet and Hands to\r\nthe Lame and Lazy, Eyes to the Blind or dim-sighted, and raising the\r\nDead and the Drousy, to Life and Activity.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Go on, dear _Tom_, go on, with your Raptures and Enthusiastical\r\nReveries; but pray allow me to ask you one plain Question, what (if all\r\nyou affirm be true) cou'd possibly hinder, this necessary, and indeed\r\nthis important Enlargement of their Fund.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why really, Mr. _Dean_, I cannot answer your Enquiry, without\r\nthrowing one of the heaviest Imputations on a Nation, which I wou'd\r\nhave Died to serve effectually, and which I spent my Life in labouring\r\nto serve, in too narrow and stinted a Manner. It must be confest, too\r\nfew of our Nobility or Gentry, shew'd that Generosity of Soul to\r\nencrease the annual Income of the Society, by their Contributions, as\r\nmight have been expected, from the Numbers of worthy Men among us, who\r\ndo us real Honour. It is certain his Majesty set the Nation a noble\r\nExample, by Assigning them a Charter, and allowing them an handsome\r\nannual Revenue out of his Treasury; and what shou'd hinder Crowds of\r\nour worthiest Noblemen and Gentlemen, of large Fortunes and Minds\r\nproportioned to them, to Subscribe Ten or Twenty Pounds a Year, to so\r\nnoble and so successful a Scheme, is hard and perhaps painful to say: I\r\nam the more amaz'd at it, as they cou'd not but say, it wou'd have\r\nraised _Ireland_ from Idleness to Industry, from Ignorance to\r\nKnowledge; from Contempt and Disregard, to Honour and Credit; and wou'd\r\nnot have left us in fifty Years, an Idler or a Beggar, (which are but\r\nsynonimous Terms) in the whole Kingdom. A Dish or two sav'd from their\r\nTables, or a Bottle or two from their Revellings, an Horse or two left\r\nout of their Stables, nay even a lac'd Coat, or a lac'd Livery sunk: a\r\nNight of Gaming, a trifling Frolick, a Jaunt of Pleasure deducted from\r\ntheir usual Expences; or what is still better, a Winter or two spent in\r\ndoing Good on their own Estates, wou'd more than answer all: It is\r\ncertain, that it is absolutely incumbent on every Gentleman, I will not\r\nsay that loves _Ireland_, but that loves himself and his Family, to do\r\nhis best to assist so happy a Scheme, so distinguish'd a Society, with\r\nhis Purse, his Head and his Hands, if he knows how to use any of them.\r\nNay, they shou'd extend the same Methods, and the same Premiums, to\r\ntheir several Provinces, Counties and Cities, for the particular Arts\r\nand Manufactures, that are likeliest to thrive there: And if they\r\ndiffused them to their own Estates, Manors and Tenants, it wou'd in\r\nTime with Patience and Management, produce vast Effects, and a strange\r\nRevolution in our Circumstances, Customs and Manners. These are\r\nThoughts worthy of Men, of Christians, of Free-born _Britons_, and\r\nrational Creatures! worthy to be planted and nursed in every honest\r\nBreast, and to be spread as universally, as the Air we breathe, and the\r\nBounds of Nature and the World. He that has them, and feeds and\r\ncultivates them in his Soul, and brings them into common Life and\r\nAction in his Country, has a better Claim to the Love of his Maker, or\r\nFellow-Citizens, than if he had founded Empires, or discover'd new\r\nWorlds.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Very well, _Tom_--but pray will Mankind agree to these fine\r\nDoctrines, or will they not rather despise or ridicule them, as a\r\nlittle on the Romantick.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. If the Lazy, the Vicious, and the Selfish laugh at such Notions,\r\nand look on such Plans of Things, as Dreams and Visions; the Active,\r\nthe Virtuous, and the Disinterested, know their real Worth, and wish\r\nand labour, to have them spread as widely and as forcibly among Men, as\r\nVices corrupt; and Plagues destroy. I and some others did our best, to\r\npropagate such ways of thinking and acting here; but I fear we might to\r\nas much Purpose, have admonish'd the modern _Italians_, to imitate the\r\nCourage, Zeal and publick Spirit of the antient _Romans_, for I did not\r\nfind, that we made many Converts to our Opinions. However, Charity\r\nmakes me think, that what chiefly hinders our Gentlemen from acting\r\nright, and making such Thoughts the great Rules of their Conduct; is\r\nthe dread of being Singular, and the unmanly fear of envious Tempers.\r\nThey apprehend being traduced or sneer'd at, by the common Herd of\r\nMankind for their insolent Zeal, and their daring to set up to serve\r\nothers, and improve their Countrymen, and therefore they decline it. It\r\nis odd how any good, not to say any great Mind, can be overaw'd by so\r\nmean a Modesty, by so poor a Terror, as the Censure or Malice of those\r\nhe labours to serve, and yet Hundreds (I speak from long Experience)\r\nare influenced by it. What makes me wonder the more at such Conduct,\r\nis, that I am persuaded Malice here below, is not only design'd by the\r\ngreat Author of Good, as a Trial of our Virtue, to see if it is real\r\nand constant to the Touch, as the Goldsmith does his Metal by passing\r\nit thro' the Fire, but I cou'd even think Malice, is also a sort of\r\nReward to Virtue.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Bless us all, _Tom!_ Malice a Reward to Virtue! that is\r\nsomething new indeed, _Tom_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. It may be absurd also, but I am sometimes inclined to think it\r\nso, because it generally encreases and exalts our Worth, and also as it\r\nfrequently serves to make it appear with the greater Dignity and Glory,\r\nwhen the Malice of Envyers is vanquish'd or silenced. Besides we often\r\nsee it a direct Spur to noble Actions, and find it stimulates our\r\nArdour to new advances; and when our Souls are firm enough, to smile at\r\nand even wish well to our Detractors, it swells the Heart with a nobler\r\nJoy, and an higher Delight, than even Virtue in any other Situation can\r\ngive. But however that may be, I am sure it is the chief Reward of\r\nVirtue in this World, and this Age. But to dismiss that Point, I must\r\nobserve that it has often amaz'd me, to see how few Gentlemen I cou'd\r\npersuade to exert themselves, by proper Donations or Subscriptions, to\r\nassist a Society that is so eminently useful to their Country.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I think you have accounted for it pretty well already, I will\r\nonly add this plain Truth, that Men love their Money better than their\r\nHealth, or their dear Bodies, to say nothing of their Souls. For this\r\nReason it is, that they don't Care for giving it to Schemes of Notions,\r\nand airy Views of Industry, and Improving of Nations; but they keep it\r\nfor solid Substantial Things, their Racing and Gaming, their Hawks and\r\ntheir Hounds, their Cloaths and their Coaches, their Houses and their\r\nEquipages, their Kitchens and Cellars, their Amours and Amusements.\r\nThey are so far from giving their Money to such Projects and Views,\r\nthat they will not even give their Thoughts or their Time to them, lest\r\nthey shou'd be mislead, into the Plague of reading, and thinking, and\r\nreasoning; of contriving the best Methods, of punishing the Idle,\r\nreclaiming the Vicious, or employing the Poor. Such troublesome\r\nMethods, may prove the overthrow of Electioneering and Borough-buying,\r\nand their embosom'd Thirst for the poorest Power, the meanest Places,\r\nand the basest Gain; and in a Word it wou'd be the Destruction, of all\r\nthose dirty Jobbs, that enrich private Rogues and beggar Nations. How,\r\ndear _Tom_, cou'd you expect such dissipated Minds, such a listless\r\npleasurable Gentry, wou'd ever contribute a Thought, or a Shilling to\r\nimprove _Ireland_, who won't improve one Thousand Acres, to help their\r\nChildren and feed their Families? Who will not even take the Trouble,\r\nor be at the Expence, to lay out Nurseries for adorning their Estates,\r\nor plant out Groves and Woods, to make their Residence pleasant to\r\nthem; nay, who will not even Build good Mansion Houses, or comfortable\r\nOffices for themselves or their Posterity? Wou'd such unthinking\r\nunactive Mortals, subscribe to Societies, or lighten their Purses to\r\nestablish Premiums, who tho' they cou'd make themselves and their\r\nFortunes easy, by a little Management, tho' they cou'd starve their\r\nDiseases by Temperance, and be an Honour to their Country, by a little\r\nVirtue and Dignity of Behaviour, will not think them worth their\r\nAttention. One shou'd never expect, mighty Efforts of Goodness or\r\nGreatness of Mind, from any Men, or even dream of moderate ones from\r\n_Irishmen_; or at least whoever does, shou'd remember what the\r\n_Italian_ says, 'He who lives on Hope dies of Hunger.' As there are few\r\namong us, _Tom_, who have exalted Minds, enlarg'd Understandings, or\r\nuncorrupted Hearts, join'd with a noble Contempt, for whatever can\r\nhappen to us here, it is pretty evident, why their Subscriptions were\r\nso few and so mean; for without these transcendent Qualities, 'tis hard\r\nto conceive how Men can truly love their Country, and be real sincere\r\nPatriots. Numbers have Generosity enough, to relieve a distrest Family,\r\nto join for a Ridotto, to set up a Musick Meeting, or an Assembly, or\r\nSubscribe for a Week's Races; but they wou'd as soon contribute to the\r\nBuilding of Churches, or endowing Colleges for the Advancement of\r\nLearning, as to promote the Trade, the Tillage, the Manufactures, the\r\nWelfare of _Ireland_, by taxing their Pocket, or substracting from\r\ntheir Pleasures. There is however one Excuse, which I must plead for\r\nthem, notwithstanding all I have said, and that is the too general\r\nDespair, of doing any Service to their Country; by such Subscriptions,\r\nthe Remedy is so disproportioned to the Disease. 'Tis, they think, like\r\nSir _Joseph Jekills_, leaving 30,000 _l._ by his Will, to help to pay\r\noff the National Debt, of eighty Millions.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. That was a poor Excuse indeed; for a considerable Number of\r\ngenerous Subscriptions, wou'd greatly relieve the Wants and Distresses\r\nof _Ireland_.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. No more than a few Showers of Rain, wou'd quench the\r\nConflagration, if the _Pyrenees_ with all their Forests were on Fire,\r\nas we Read they once were. All the _Dublin_ Society did, was to shew\r\nwhat we wanted, and to set an Example, of what might be done, to help\r\nour dreadful Ailments: But you might as well expect to work Miracles,\r\nand to feed Thousands, like our Saviour, with a few Loaves, as to\r\nretrieve a Nation, by throwing a few Widow's Mites into the Treasury.\r\nIt is true, Nations, with their many Hands, make light Work; but where\r\ncan the Power be found, to animate and employ Millions, but in the\r\nOmnipotence of him who made them, or the force and weight of Monarchs,\r\n(the Representatives of Heaven) who Rule and Govern them. All you and\r\nyour Society cou'd do, was to shew you understood the miserable\r\nCondition of _Ireland_, and to manifest your sincere desire to assist\r\nwith some Care and Judgment in the Cure; but you cou'd as well remove\r\nMountains by your Faith, as the Ills we groaned under, by so adequate a\r\nRemedy, as your impoverish'd stinted Fund.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why you will make me lose all Patience, Mr. _Dean_! Do you think\r\nbecause I have laid aside Flesh and Blood, that I can bear any Thing?\r\nDid not I lay before you, a long delightful Account, of almost infinite\r\nServices which the Society did _Ireland_, in improving old\r\nManufactures, or introducing new Ones; in advancing our Husbandry, in\r\nencouraging every Art and every Branch of Industry? As I am now a truly\r\nrational thinking Creature, I wou'd not willingly lose my Temper, but I\r\nsolemnly declare, that the Rules the Society prescrib'd, and the\r\nLabours they set on Foot, the Fields which they sow'd or they planted,\r\nthe Houses they got Built, the Rivers they bank'd in, the Bogs which\r\nthey drain'd, the Marshes they laid dry, and the Lands they gain'd from\r\nthe Ocean, have alter'd the very Nature and Face of the Country, and\r\nchang'd even the Air and the Climate for the better!\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Stuff, Nonsense, Madness! One wou'd think you were alive still,\r\n_Tom_, by your furious flourishing on Nothing, or Trifles next to\r\nnothing. The Nature and Face of the Country alter'd, and even the Air\r\nand the Climate chang'd for the better! Have you a Mind to talk my\r\nReason away, or make a Jest of my zeal for Truth? This is the old way\r\nof prating and vaunting in _Ireland_, that used to make me, and every\r\nFriend to it sick of such unmeaning Declamations. We are such Fools as\r\never to be bragging of our Soil and our Linens, our Wealth and our\r\nPlenty, our Weather and our Climate, as if we strove to bring over a\r\ngreater Crowd of _English_ Refugees hither.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Refugees! dear _Dean_, how can you indulge such an Acrimony of\r\nSpeech? That is not only an invidious, but a sarcastical and barbarous\r\nExpression.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Not a whit. I speak only of such as come over to us, for their\r\nLove to Religion, for the hope of Liberty of Conscience, whatever they\r\nbelieve, or Preferments in the Church, whatever they Practice, or to\r\navoid Persecution from Men arm'd with Power and the Laws, the\r\nRapaciousness of Creditors, and the Insolence of Sheriffs and Bailiffs,\r\nand to live at peace here, with quiet Minds and easy Circumstances.\r\nThis is a true Notion of a Refugee, and I think such People come over\r\nfast enough without such ostentatious Proclamations to give them new\r\nEncouragements: My Conduct always took a different Turn, and if I had\r\nliv'd a little longer, I had wrote a Treatise to prove _Ireland_, the\r\nmost inhospitable and barbarous of all habitable Islands, and the very\r\nPiss-pot of the Western World. I even made it a Rule to rail at it all\r\nI could, to frighten such People from coming hither, lest hearing there\r\nwas Corn in the Land, shou'd invite them over to eat it up, while we\r\nwere kept Starving. You pretend to take Offence at my Expressions, but\r\nI see plainly, what vext you was, because forsooth I reflected with\r\nsome Spleen, on your little huckstering Society, with its two-penny\r\nRewards and three-penny Premiums, for going any silly Errands you sent\r\nPeople on; and so in mere Contradiction you make them reform our Heaven\r\nand our Earth, and mend our very Climate and the Face of Nature. For my\r\npart as to the Face of Nature and the Country, I know no great\r\nAlterations, but the shaving her Beard close, and cutting down all her\r\nWoods, so that we now pay 40,000 _l._ per Annum for imported Timber.\r\nWhen I was an Inhabitant of this lower World, I remember I lov'd the\r\nCountry well enough in the Summer Season; but I cou'd not bear to spend\r\nmuch Time in it, as I never cou'd Walk or ride in a single Field; that\r\ndid not put me in a Passion, either to see it as wild as ever Nature\r\nleft it after the Mud of the Deluge; or at least not so much improv'd\r\nas it might be, if the Owner had common Sense or common Industry. What\r\never enrag'd me most was, that tho' such Fellows I knew by Experience,\r\nwou'd venture their Limbs or their Necks for a Guinea, yet they had not\r\nthe Skill to make Five Pounds more of their Ground than they got by it,\r\ntho' a little Labour and Art wou'd have done the Thing. When I look'd\r\non my Airings on the wild Wastes of rich Lands unbuilt and untill'd, I\r\nsigh'd for the want of Houses and Tenements, of Welders and Plows; and\r\nwhen after ten Miles riding, I found some lame Attempts after such\r\nThings, I was still more vex'd to see our Cabbins, and what we call'd\r\nour Corn Grounds, no more resembling the Buildings and Tillage of\r\n_England_, than an Ape does a Man. I really don't expect that _Ireland_\r\nwill ever be properly improv'd, till the _Millennium_ makes the whole\r\nEarth a Paradise; and then after a long Struggle between Heaven and\r\nNature, we may chance to come in for a share; tho' at present Heaven is\r\nso little minded here, as to Churches or Chapels, or national Piety,\r\nthat I don't wonder to see the Land running into a Desart every Hour,\r\nfill'd with Beasts and a few Savages.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I see, _Dean_, you have not forgot your old way of thinking and\r\nspeaking. It is well there is no Pen and Ink, or Printing allow'd under\r\nGround; or else we shou'd have old work below Stairs----\r\n\r\n    _Sub Terris tonnuisse putes----_\r\n\r\nAs the witty Classick expresses it.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. If there was, I wou'd raise a little Earthquake yet in this\r\nKingdom. But I have not forgot, _Tom_, nor I cannot yet forgive your\r\nstrange Rant of improving the very Climate in _Ireland_. If it was, I\r\nwou'd not curse it, as _Harry_ the Eighth's Fool did the fine Weather,\r\nfor taking all the good Company abroad from him, but I shou'd rail at\r\nit and you for another Cause; for fear of bringing us better Company\r\nthan I desire in _Ireland_. I must confess honestly, that our Winter\r\nbegins very late, and hardly appears till about the End of _December_,\r\nand is gone before the beginning of _February_. But then it must be\r\nown'd, that we have but very little Spring, unless it be of Grass and\r\nWeeds; and that our Autumn lasts but very few Weeks, without any\r\nHarvest to gather in, but a little pittance of Corn and some half made\r\nHay; and as for our Summers (as we call them) they come as it were by\r\nChance, now and then one, when _Spain_ and _Italy_ have done with them.\r\nNay, even then, we only get them, as Servants do their surfeited\r\nMasters broken Meals; half hot, half cold, in little Scraps and Morsels\r\nthat do us no Good. In short, _Tom_, a Summer in _Ireland_ when it\r\nwanders thither, is of as little Service as fair Weather in\r\n_Greenland_, where nothing is the better for it, but vast Swamps and\r\nSavannahs and a wild waste of Plains and Mountains, a few rational\r\nBrutes that dwell in Caves and Holes of the Rocks, and a parcel of\r\nHares and Deers, which they live tollerably on, while they have Light\r\nenough to hunt them. And to talk of mending our Climate, where nothing\r\nbut a general Conflagration can dry the Land, or purge the Dampness of\r\nour unelastick Air, is as absurd as the Philosophers Sun-dial in the\r\nGrave. Ah, _Tom_, I was always a very Atmospherical Creature; and often\r\nhave the Rains of _Ireland_ sunk my Spirits, and made me envy those\r\nhappy Climates, where the Natives toast in the Sunshine, till they\r\nalmost grow tir'd of it, and rejoice for Rain and bad Weather, like so\r\nmany Hackney Coachmen.\r\n\r\nBut as I hope you have done with all your mighty Reasons, for thinking\r\n_Ireland_ on the mending hand, I expect you will indulge me now, while\r\nI give you mine, why I think her in a very dangerous declining\r\nSituation.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. With all my Heart, provided you will allow me the Priviledge of\r\na free Conference, and bear with my opposing, whatever I think is wrong\r\nin your Assertions, and let me canvass your Opinions where I want\r\nInformation or Proofs. I came to call on you, in order to Talk over all\r\nthat I thought dangerous or distressful, in our present Circumstances\r\nand our future Prospects; and to consider what hope we can strike out\r\nof Relief or Comfort, for this neglected People and Country; and I\r\npromise before hand, I shall not contradict you in any Thing, where you\r\ndo not force me to it, by an over-bearing Zeal, or a querulous Temper.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. A fair Preliminary, to which I readily Subscribe. Now the first\r\nReason, _Tom_, why I have uneasy fears for our Country, and for my\r\nhaving little Expectation of mending her Circumstances is, the utter\r\nabsence of all Industry and Frugality among us. There is no other\r\nRemedy for a thoughtless Nation, which gets little or nothing from\r\nothers, but saving all it can; and being frugal in proportion to its\r\nIndolence and Poverty. This is a self-evident Truth, and yet our\r\nNobility and Gentry spend in Vanity and Luxury, treble as much as Men\r\nof twice their Fortune in _England_, tho' they do not half the Good\r\namong their Tenants, and neither spend half the Time or Money with\r\nthem, or take half the pains to improve them, while they every Year\r\nencrease their Rents, and our Beggars: 'Tis dismal to make the poor\r\nTenant give the full Tale of Brick, tho' we give them no Straw, and\r\nthat we starve them, by sending our Money abroad for foreign\r\nCommodities, to feed our Extravagance, and gratify our Madness for\r\nimporting Fopperies; tho' we hurt our Families for the present, and\r\nruin our Poor for ever, who dare not set up Manufactures they know will\r\nnot be worn. Surely in a Kingdom where no body looks to his own\r\nAffairs, as they are connected with the Publick, 'tis Time the Publick\r\nshou'd look to every Bodies. What a melancholy Prospect is it, to see\r\nfine Cloaths, fine Equipages, fine Race Horses, fine Laces, fine\r\nDishes, deep Play and deep Drinking, the Glory and delight of our\r\nPeople of Fashion; and Ease, and Sloth, and Sleep, and Potatoes, the\r\nchief Joy of our Lifeless neglected Natives. Is not such a Nation like\r\na Ship set on Fire on one end, and sinking by a thousand Shot-holes and\r\nLeaks, at the other? If we were a little frugal, we might the better\r\nbear the Loss we undergo by our Idleness and Inactivity; but when our\r\nGentlemen sacrifice so much to their Pleasures, and our Ladies to their\r\nFinery, both which they wisely seek for from foreign Productions, we\r\nmust be undone unless we prevent our Destruction, by resolving to Work\r\nand be busy. There is no Alternative----, one of these two Things we\r\nmust do; we must either be less Mad for the Manufactures and Products\r\nof other Nations, or we must enlarge our Industry, and make Reprisals\r\nthereby on our Neighbours, in order to keep our People alive and easy\r\nwhile they are Living. Possibly I may have said this before, _Tom_, and\r\nprobably I shall say it again, for a full Heart and a troubled Mind, is\r\napt to deal in Repetitions, when they grow almost desperate, and see\r\nlittle hope of a Change for the better.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Dear _Dean_, I own I shou'd be glad to contradict you, as to\r\nthese dismal Representations of Things; but I have learn'd since I left\r\na false World, to love Truth, tho' it be ever so strong against us, or\r\nputs us and our Actions in ever so bad a Light. It is too certain\r\nIndustry and Frugality are the two great Sources of Prosperity in all\r\nNations; and it is a mortifying Reflection to consider what a miserable\r\nShare we have in either of them here. 'Tis as certain if we be Frugal\r\nand Industrious, we must be easy and happy, as that we must be wretched\r\nand miserable, if we continue our Love to Expence and our hatred to\r\nLabour. Nay Frugality and Wealth, which is the Consequence of it, will\r\nnot do, unless we are diligent Workers too; for _Spain_ is a Proof, and\r\nso is _Portugal_, that even Hoards of Money will not enrich a Nation,\r\nunless their Gold is used to promote Industry among the meaner Sort,\r\nand to raise their Thoughts above Sleep, and Rags, and Dirt, and\r\nInactivity.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Very true, _Tom_, and indeed one wou'd hope unless Heaven has\r\nirrecoverably doom'd us to Destruction, there are sufficient Remains of\r\ncommon Sense and Honesty left among our Countrymen, to new form our\r\nManners in these Regards, and improve their ways of Thinking and\r\nActing. In such Case, they may in two or three Centuries learn to\r\nbelieve, Frugality and Industry, Arts and Manufactures worth\r\nencouraging, and their Luxury and Debauchery, and an utter Absence of\r\nall Regard to the Publick, worth Reforming. It is a shocking Truth to\r\nsay all this wou'd be done, if Men wou'd but own themselves oblig'd,\r\nand wou'd therefore resolve to behave, like reasonable Creatures: And\r\nyet this is a Point as hard to bring about, as if we were arguing with\r\n_Hottentots_, and persuading _Tartars_ to forbear publick Plunders, and\r\nto have some regard to Right and Wrong, and the real Happiness and\r\nMisery of themselves and their Posterity.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I agree with you entirely, Mr. _Dean_, and indeed if we cou'd\r\ncure our national Ailments by Writing and Speaking, as People who\r\nprofess removing Disorders, by Words and Charms, what you and I and\r\nsome others have Publish'd, might have done the Work: But alas!\r\npressing Industry and Frugality on many of our People, who have been\r\ntrain'd up to Sloth and Squandering, is but of equal Efficacy with\r\npreaching up Temperance to Sots, or Cleanliness to Negroes, when their\r\nHabits and Vices are all against you. The Church of _Rome_ has plac'd\r\n_Purgatory_ in the North-West of _Ireland_, which was then one of the\r\nremotest wildest Parts of the Earth; and tho' I have reason to believe,\r\nthey now Wish, they had removed it something more out of View, yet I am\r\nsure there is no Part of the Globe, so fit a _Purgatory_ for Sloth as\r\n_Ireland_, or where People so generally pay St. _Paul_'s Penalty for\r\nnot Working, by not Eating.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. If due Care was taken, this natural Supineness of our lower\r\nPeople, might be soon turn'd into Activity and Vivacity, by letting\r\nthem see and feel the Sweets of Labour, and convincing them by Fact and\r\nExperience, that when once the Poor are made industrious, they turn all\r\nthey Touch to Gold, like _Midas_'s Fingers of famous Memory. As to our\r\nsleepy Countrymen, I cannot but say that it is a Pity, where Men are\r\ncommanded to give one Day of the Week, to doing nothing but Acts of\r\nPiety, they don't regard the other Part of the Law, and labour the\r\nother Six. This at least shou'd be the Magistrate's, and the human\r\nLegislator's Business; but really there is no Law made, nor Care taken\r\nabout it, but every Body overlooks this plain neglected Truth, that Men\r\nought to be as accountable to the Magistrate, for their Time as their\r\nActions, and as punishable for wasting it. But our _Irish_ seem\r\nactually to have mistaken the divine Commandment, and it is well their\r\nPriests did not leave it out of the Decalogue, as they did the Second.\r\nThey manage, as if they thought God had bid them be idle six Days of\r\nthe Week, and Work but one, and very moderately on that one. I have\r\noften met in Authors, and think the Assertion true, that the very\r\nGenius of the Popish Religion indisposes Men to Labour; as we see by\r\ntheir numerous Holidays, Feasts and Fasts: All which are direct Enemies\r\nto Toil and Handy-craft, and make the returns to Work disagreeable. It\r\nis undoubted that the Protestants out Trade and out Work the Papists;\r\nthey have (as all observe) fewer Beggars, they have fewer Drains from\r\ntheir Industry, by those who sleep away their Lives in Colleges and\r\nNunneries; they maintain a much smaller Number of secular Priests, and\r\neven to those, they do not prohibit Marriage, and to say no more at\r\npresent, those lazy Drones the Friars of so many different Orders, are\r\nCankers and Consumptions quite unknown to their Constitution. In most\r\nProtestant Countries, more than ordinary Attention, for good political\r\nReasons, has been given to this great Point. In _Holland_ all are\r\nemploy'd, even the lettred World deal in Traffick and are Merchants;\r\nnay the Deaf, the Lame, the Blind, the Dumb, and the very Dead Work.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. The Dead Work! That is a Flight extraordinary sure, Mr. _Dean_,\r\nand I must call on you to retract that Mistake.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Not at all; for tho' that Truth is a little incomprehensible in\r\n_Ireland_, where we have no such Incitements, in _Holland_ the Statues\r\nand Monuments of their useful and industrious Citizens, and the\r\nEpitaphs and Praises on them, prompt and inflame the living to emulate\r\nthem, and push on their Virtue to excell, in every Art, and open every\r\nRoad to Profit and to Glory. When I was throwing away (like other\r\nPeople) my Thoughts and my Time above Ground, I used often to think on\r\nthese Matters; and I fear to as little Purpose as we talk of them now.\r\nHowever I must say, _Tom_, that tho' if our rich People would think and\r\ngrow Managers, and our Poor wou'd Work, and keep their Hands and their\r\nChildren busy, nine tenths of our Evils wou'd be remov'd, yet I am\r\nconvinc'd, neither of these important Points will be minded, till we\r\nare forc'd to get better Notions of Things, by seeing the Nation ruin'd\r\nby the want of them, as often as a Boy at School is whipt for playing\r\nthe Truant, before he will mend.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Ruin is as terrible a Remedy, as a deadly Sickness is a\r\nReformer; and I had rather hope that sumptuary Laws against Dress,\r\nRacing, Gaming, _&c._ if we were Wise enough to make them, and\r\namendable enough to mind them when made, wou'd do our Business much\r\nbetter. 'Tis a Misfortune for _Ireland_, that our Spendthrifts so often\r\nrun out their Lives and their Estates together, and so their Examples\r\nare lost on us; for I ever thought it a Pity, they shou'd not live\r\nforty or fifty Years in beggary, their own Lives are such a Torment to\r\nthem, and they become thereby such fine Scare-crows, to our young\r\nunthinking Squanderers, when they see them all the while, standing as\r\nit were in a kind of Pillory. Nothing keeps the _Dutch_ so frugal as\r\ntheir Loads of high Taxes, for some good Author, (and I think 'tis your\r\nold Friend Sir _William Temple_) tells us, one cannot have a Dish of\r\nwell dressed Fish at a Tavern in _Holland_, without paying near thirty\r\nGabels for it. We want some Remedy for our Extravagancies of all Kinds\r\ngreatly, but this is so shocking a one, that one wou'd hope the very\r\nfear of it might cure us, as some Men have renounc'd their\r\nIntemperance, by their dread of the Gout and the Doctor. Without some\r\nsuch helps, our fine Gentlemen seem not inclined to learn or consider,\r\nthat we shou'd save immense Sums to our Country, if we eat Corn of our\r\nown sowing, drunk home-made Wines of our own Brewing, fed on Fish of\r\nour own catching, burn'd Coals of our own raising, and wore no Cloaths\r\nthat were not of our own manufacturing. If they were once convinced of\r\nthis, good Effects wou'd follow, and we shou'd soon acknowledge that it\r\nis barely owing to our own Extravagance, Thoughtlesness, Sleepiness,\r\nDrunkenness and Vanity, that we don't, with one Voice, condemn and\r\nrenounce such evident Errors, in our national Conduct, and fix on their\r\nRemedies.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. This _Tom_, is merely dreaming of a publick Cure for an\r\nepidemical Distemper, as _Curtius_ says _Ptolomy_ did; but we shou'd\r\nnot only get our Gentlemen, to think for the Nation and themselves; for\r\nwe want severe Laws to cure the Laziness and Indolence of our lower\r\nPeople. As Idleness is the great Source of Theft, picking and filching,\r\nthe natural Punishment of at least all smaller Criminals, seems to be\r\nhard Labour for Life, or Years. We see in _France_ and _Spain_ they man\r\ntheir Gallies this way, and in _Sweden_ and _Denmark_ they employ them\r\nin their publick Works, and chiefly about their Shipping and their\r\nDocks. No Punishment cou'd be more terrifying to an _Irishman_, who we\r\ngenerally think is averse to Labour; none cou'd be more useful to our\r\ndistressed Land, where we lose more People by doing Nothing, than are\r\ndestroy'd by the Wars and Conquests, the Voyages and Traffick of other\r\nKingdoms. On this Account we shou'd take Care, that Idlers, Beggars and\r\nvagabond Strollers, shou'd be treated with the Sharpest Rigour, as they\r\ndo not only deny to assist their Country by their honest Endeavours,\r\nbut live like Drones on the Spoil of the Industrious. It shou'd be a\r\nMaxim in every well governed State, but especially in _Ireland_, that\r\nIdleness shou'd be as severely punish'd as petty Larceny; and to beg\r\nwith an Ability to Work, shou'd be regarded and treated as a Kind of\r\ntraining up Youth for Stealing, (when they have learn'd the proper Cant\r\nand Tricks of their Apprenticeship) and consequently to relieve a\r\nVagabond, shou'd be as faulty and as corrigible as receiving stolen\r\nGoods. The proper Place for the Relief of sturdy Beggars, is a good\r\nCounty Work-house, where the Labours of such Vagabonds (and indeed of\r\nall Criminals till they are Tried and Discharg'd) shou'd go to the\r\nMaintainance of such Poor, who are utterly incapable of Work, and whose\r\nParishes can't support them.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I am quite in your way of Thinking on this Subject, Mr. _Dean_,\r\nI remember Doctor _Basire_ in his Life of Bishop _Cosin_, tells us that\r\nin several Years Travels in _Turky_ and _Holland_, he never once met a\r\nMan who ask'd him an Alms; so that here we see the Wisdom of the State\r\nmay have the same Effect with the Laws of God among the _Jews_, which\r\nprohibited any Beggar to be a Burthen, or a Disgrace to their Tribes.\r\nCharity to Vagabonds is Cruelty to the State, which is interested as\r\nthe Civil Law, and our own Statutes speak, that every Member of the\r\nCommunity, should use his Labour and his Substance, to the best\r\nAdvantage. Every Stroller or Vagabond is a Loss to the Kingdom, and is\r\nlittle better than a licenc'd Plunderer of our People, and every such\r\nPerson, is really a living Instance of Neglect or Ignorance in those,\r\nwho shou'd give us by Law a proper Power and Place, to force him to\r\nearn his Bread by his Hands. Whoever has Health and wants Food, shou'd\r\nbe oblig'd to Work one way or other, for if Idleness was always\r\npunish'd by our Statutes with severe Labour, as surely as Felony is by\r\nDeath, it would then like Thieving be confin'd to the Night, and we\r\nshou'd be at least good Day Labourers. The Strength of the political\r\nBody, depends as much on its Members being properly exercised, as that\r\nof the natural, and on the Neglect of it, infinite Disorders follow.\r\nBut alas, _Dean_, this is not enough attended to in _Ireland_, or we\r\nshou'd have Work-Houses in every County, but we have the peculiar\r\nMisfortune of having this dreadful Mixture in our Circumstances; that\r\nwe have all the Vices, Extravagancies, and Luxury of a rich Nation,\r\nwith all the Wants, the Distresses and Despair of a poor one. If once\r\nour Gentry and Nobility wou'd set us fair Examples of Frugality and\r\nActivity, we shou'd soon reform, but alas! great Estates, as we use\r\nthem, seem design'd for little else but the Triflers of the World, and\r\nthe wretched Fashions, Fopperies and Fooleries, they are generally\r\nthrown away on. However it is certain, Providence appointed them for\r\nnobler Purposes, and it were to be wish'd the present Stewards of them\r\n(for they are evidently nothing more) wou'd seriously consider this,\r\nthat they may be able to give the Bestower a better Account of them.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I was saying so every Day, for the last fifty Years of my\r\nSlavery among Men, and all to no Purpose! But there is another Matter\r\nthat makes me fear for the Welfare of _Ireland_, and that is the want\r\nof proper Manufactures being set up there. I see _Tom_, you are ready\r\nto bawl out to me, the _Irish_ Cambricks, the _Irish_ Linens, but alas!\r\neven as to them I am sorry to say, they wou'd do _Great Britain_ and\r\n_Ireland_ twice the Service, if they were doubly encouraged, and not\r\nleft to creep to those Provinces, where they might go with a brisker\r\nProgress, if the Funds of the Trustees were enlarg'd, or their Premiums\r\nmore happily applied. But I leave that, _Tom_, to Time and the\r\nLegislature, for the Manufactures which I lament the want of, are those\r\nwhich enrich _France_, _Germany_ and _Holland_; such as those of Brass,\r\nTin, Copper, Lead and Iron Work, in all their amazing Species; those of\r\nGlass, Tapestry, Hats, Silk, Leather, Paper, Pins, Needles, Lace,\r\nEarthen-Ware, and Numbers of others, of which our own Island can\r\nlargely supply the Materials, if we wou'd make use of them. Whether it\r\nproceeds from our Ignorance or our Poverty, our before mentioned\r\nLaziness, or want of Capacity I cannot say; but Arts and Manufactures\r\nseem to be discourag'd so remarkably, in this unthinking and unthought\r\nof Island, as if we wou'd fain obtain the Name, of _Omnium bonarum\r\nArtium noverca_, formerly as I remember given to _Scythia_. Even those\r\nfew Attempts we make to deserve well in some of them, are brow-beaten\r\nor neglected by our People of Fashion. This is a Complaint I must often\r\nmake, and can never be too often repeated in their Ears, as without\r\ntheir Help no Workmen, how industrious soever, can thrive. 'Tis\r\nmiserable that our polite People, will not be content to Ruin their own\r\nFamilies by their extravagant Finery, but their Country too, and all\r\nwho dare endeavour to exert a little Industry in home Manufactures.\r\nSurely the Wearers of all Foreign Goods, and especially the Fair Sex,\r\ndo not believe, or do not consider, that they deliberately starve their\r\nown poor Countrymen and their Families, by making them Work in vain.\r\nThey shou'd in Pity, in Generosity, in Justice reflect, that since we\r\nare not allowed to Export our Silk and Woollen Goods abroad, the least\r\nthat every Friend to _Ireland_ can do, is to encourage them so far, as\r\nto wear them at Home, tho' they do not quite come up to those that are\r\nImported to us. Tho' we are terribly impoverish'd by this fondness for\r\nGoods which other Nations send us, it is still some Comfort, that there\r\nis no Law to force us to it as yet, and that the whole of this dreadful\r\nRuin, is grounded on our own Humours, which a little thinking, some\r\nCharity, and a general Poverty, may remove in Time. I know no reason,\r\nwhy a Thousand beautiful Faces I have seen in _Ireland_, shou'd desire\r\nto look lovelier than Nature, and the Produce of their native Kingdom\r\ncan make them: And for our Gentlemen (if they are Gentlemen) they\r\nshou'd take a Pride in wearing nothing but what is wrought in _Irish_\r\nLooms, and make it a Case of Conscience, like Archbishop _King_, Bishop\r\n_Berkeley_, and Crowds of Patriots I cou'd Name, to be cloathed by our\r\nown People. The _Dutch_ I am told, have lately issued a Placart,\r\nforbidding all their Subjects (excepting Day-Labourers who are too poor\r\nto trangress it) to wear any Silk or Woollen Goods not Fabricated in\r\ntheir Provinces. The greatest Personages are restrain'd herein by\r\nsevere Penalties, and tho' we cannot make such a Law, (nor perhaps\r\nshou'd not desire it in Respect to one Country at least) yet certainly\r\nwe shou'd form general Resolutions, and try to Establish an universal\r\nCustom (which is equal to any Law) of Feeding and Encouraging our own\r\nWorkmen and Tradesmen.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Laws, Mr. _Dean_, are not so much wanting, as the Will to favour\r\nour own Goods, and our own People; and surely as you observe, all who\r\nplease, may determine in their several Families, to use the Produce of\r\nour _Irish_ Looms; and in the mean Time I cannot but make this sad\r\nReflection, that if Industry and Labour be the great Standard of Value\r\nin most Things, what (under such Discouragements) can our unemploy'd\r\nCountry be worth, which except our Linens, sends abroad all the\r\nMaterials for Labour to others, and lies abed like a _Spaniard_,\r\nburning Day-Light, and proud of doing Nothing.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I remember to have Read, when I used to lose Time upon Men and\r\nBooks, that among the _Turks_, every Man of them learns some Trade or\r\nother. This Fashion they probably borrow'd from the _Jews_, who made it\r\na Maxim, that he who does not give his Son a Trade, teaches him to be a\r\nThief: And yet till our Protestants Taught the _Irish_ better Manners,\r\na Trade was as seldom learn'd as a Psalter. It is true of late Years\r\nthis Folly has been pretty much subdued, and Numbers of our Natives\r\nhave distinguish'd themselves, by their Skill in different Arts and\r\nHandicrafts, but till this Humour wears off, of slighting whatever is\r\nwrought at Home, it were better they had learn'd to Fast than to Work.\r\nWe keep Crowds of our Artificers naked who well-deserve to be cloathed;\r\nmany are as ill hutted as so many _Greenlanders_ or _Russian_ Peasants,\r\nwho ought to be well housed, if any one thought them worth taking Care\r\nof and Encouraging. But what is still more unhappy, Thousands of them\r\nare forced for fear of Jails and Beggary, to run from us to wiser\r\nCountries, where they and their Arts are well receiv'd and favour'd by\r\nour Enemies or Rivals, whose Industry and Exports they Encrease, and\r\nthereby help to Starve the Friends they have forsaken. One wou'd expect\r\ncommon Charity to them and ourselves, and common Sense in conducting\r\nour general Interests, wou'd not only have remov'd this main Obstacle\r\nto the Prosperity of _Ireland_, but wou'd also put us on setting up all\r\nKinds of new Manufactures, which we still want; let it cost us ever so\r\nmuch for setling them here, and Nursing them till they get Strength, to\r\nshift for themselves. It is certain the Publick can hardly pay too dear\r\nfor such improveable Purchases, for unquestionably where the Advantages\r\nare so considerable, saving in such Cases is meanness and madness.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. You are ever Tolling the passing Bell of _Ireland_, and yet my\r\nfears that there is too much Reason for all you advance, keep me from\r\nopposing you; when you censure the Stupidity of our Management, in\r\nregard of every Measure that can hurt us or serve us. I spent half my\r\nLife in exclaiming in the same Manner, and I might as well have spoke\r\nto the Inhabitants of these Tombstones. There is one Particular, which\r\nwith Grief I must add to all your Complaints, and it is a very\r\ndiscouraging one as to any Hopes of our Recovery, namely, that this\r\nIsland is made up of two of the most unhappy Mixtures a Kingdom can\r\nconsist of, a Multitude of Gentlemen and Beggars. The first have not\r\nTime from their Pleasures, and their own petty Interests, to think of\r\nserving us, and the others cannot either serve themselves or us,\r\nwithout Wages, Food or Raiment, which they cannot get, unless we allow\r\nthem to Purchase them by their Labours. In short, Mr. _Dean_, while our\r\nLadies scorn to wear any Thing that is _Irish_, and our Gentlemen pride\r\nthemselves who shall Drink most _French_ Wine; they both Teach their\r\nInferiors the same dreadful Folly, and make them join to enrich their\r\nEnemies, Beggar their own Workmen, exalt _France_, and sink _Ireland_,\r\nand drive every Creature that has Genius or Industry out of it, to\r\nPlaces as we observed before, where they can hope to get the\r\nNecessaries of Life by their Industry.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Your mentioning _French_ Wine, _Tom_, puts me in Mind of another\r\nterrible Remora, to the Prosperity of this unfortunate unthinking\r\nCountry. I have often thought if _Ireland_ had never been allowed to\r\nimport Foreign Wines, and we had learn'd to Content ourselves, with\r\ndrinking our own Ale, Beer, Mead and Cyder, and used no other\r\nSpirituous Liquors, we shou'd have been the richest, and the honestest,\r\nthe healthiest, and the happiest Nation under Heaven. It is a\r\nmelancholy Thought, that poor as we are, and wretched as the\r\nCircumstances of most of our Gentry are allowed to be, as to Debts and\r\nIncumbrances; yet we actually Drink more _French_ Wine, then all\r\n_England_ together, that is so much richer and abler. The Case is, few\r\nPeople drink _French_ Wine in _England_, but those who have very large\r\nEstates; Numbers who have a Thousand _per Annum_, seldom tasting it;\r\nbut with us, every Creature, that has tolerable Cloaths upon his Back,\r\nand a Guinea in his Pocket, drinks little else, tho' he has scarce the\r\nConveniences of Life for his Family. There are such Multitudes that\r\ncan't relish Life or their Food without it, that one wou'd wonder how\r\nthey can all be provided with it. This Difficulty indeed was soon\r\nremov'd; for I hear such Crowds now Trade in it, that it is to be\r\nfear'd, if their Customers this Year do not make haste to take it off\r\ntheir Hands, it grows so foul, they must Drink it themselves, or they\r\nmust sell it at last for Vinegar.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I have heard from some Ghosts, who died of the last Vintage,\r\nthat (to the Infamy of the Year 1753, be it remembered) 8000 Ton of\r\nWine was imported into this Kingdom from _France_; to the dreadful\r\nDrain of our ready Cash, the encrease of the general Poverty of our\r\nPeople, and the Misery of all who Labour and cannot Eat. Allow me to\r\nobserve here, Mr. _Dean_, that the _Chinese_ seem to know us well, who\r\nsend us not only their Teas, but also Cups to Drink it out of; and I\r\nhave often wondered that the _French_, don't send us Bottles and\r\nGlasses with their Wines, as we have not Industry enough to make them;\r\ntho' the very Bottles for 8000 Ton are computed to cost us 67000 _l._\r\nIt is dreadful to look over such Scenes of Destruction, and much more\r\nso to know they are remediless, while our People thus court _France_ to\r\nundo them, by sending for such vast Quantities of her Claret, at the\r\nsame Time I hear it is pleaded in behalf of the Importers, that they\r\nnever were guilty of such a Fault before.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. A pretty Defence truly, and yet as this was the Excuse of\r\n_Balaam_'s Ass to his Master, one wou'd think none but an Ass wou'd\r\nplead it, and I will venture to say, they had better Change it for a\r\nsolemn Vow, never to be guilty of such a Folly again. However if they\r\ndid take such a Resolution, I wou'd not advise them to enter into\r\nBonds, for the Performance of that Engagement; for I fear they wou'd\r\nforfeit them, tho' the Nation was to be Bankrupt by it, as in all\r\nprobability, if we continue to tun down such Quantities of this\r\ndestructive Liquor, it must soon be. For my part, when I think of this\r\nnational Madness, in drinking Oceans of _French_ Wine, I know not how\r\nto account for such prodigious Extravagance, in such ruinous\r\nCircumstances. We seem to live the faster, for being in a deep Decay,\r\nas Clocks have a quicker Motion, the nearer they are to being run down.\r\n'Tis an hard Case, that evident right reason can't Influence a Nation,\r\nand that there is a Necessity for a Majority of right Reasoners, to\r\nmake thinking Creatures (as we are commonly called) act as their\r\nInterest and Happiness demand. When once that fortunate Majority is\r\ngain'd, between wise Laws and good Customs, People take up general\r\nMaxims and Manners, that direct their Conduct, and form both their\r\nprivate and publick Behaviour, so as to conduce to the good of the\r\nWhole, and the well Being of each Individual. But alas! _Tom_, in\r\n_Ireland_, we neither think, or act for ourselves or the Publick, nor\r\nseem to have any System of Rules, for managing our Estates or our\r\nCountry; but we live in an extempore Method, and as Time serves, and\r\nAccidents happen, we Conduct ourselves. When we are famish'd we think\r\nof Bread, when frozen to Death, of Coals and Fire, and when we grow\r\nuneasy with the Thoughts of all our Mismanagements, Madness and\r\nFollies, a large Dose of Wine (a Hair of the very same Dog) relieves\r\nall our Griefs over Night, and we rise as Wise and as Provident as ever\r\nin the Morning. As to the Kingdom itself, we make such haste to get it\r\nundone, as if we fear'd it wou'd not be ruin'd Time enough; and yet we\r\nmay plead in Excuse, that particular Gentlemen manage no better for\r\nthemselves, or their Families. It is certain he is reckon'd no bad\r\nManager, among his neighbouring 'Squires, who can cleverly stave off\r\nhis Creditors, and keep up his Port of living undisturb'd, till he can\r\nsell (I mean settle) his Son, and clear off his Incumbrances with the\r\nWife's Fortune.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. A very true, and as sad an Account of Things; and what inhances\r\nour Misery is, that _France_ thrives by thus draining our vital Blood\r\nfrom us, as the Physicians in old _Rome_, made their decay'd Patients\r\nsustain themselves, by sucking the streaming Veins of their poor\r\nSlaves. If we paid a moderate Price for our Liquor, it were something,\r\nbut the _French_ raise their Demands, in proportion to our Calls for\r\nit; and our generous Importers, never endeavour to beat them down, as\r\nthey find they get the greater Gain, the dearer they buy it; and our\r\nGentlemen take up the same prudent way of Thinking, and never believe\r\nthemselves so generous, as when they drink Wines, that their poorer\r\nNeighbours cannot Purchase. The present Fulness of the Treasury, vastly\r\nbeyond all former Years, shews how far our Madness is risen; for this\r\nFolly of drinking away both our Estates and our Reason, has seized like\r\nan epidemical Plague, on all Ranks of Men among us. Even those of the\r\npoorer Sort, from a noble Emulation of copying their betters, drink as\r\nmuch Wine as they can; and where their Purses or their Credit will not\r\nreach so high, they must have foreign Liquors, tho' they be only Mum or\r\nCyder, Porter or Perry, and seem resolved to shew they are as little\r\nafraid of a Jail, as greater Persons.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. In other Nations the Nobility and Gentry, think for the\r\nCommonalty, and govern their Manners by the Laws they make, and the\r\nbecoming Examples they set them. But in this poor ill-starr'd Island,\r\nthey corrupt them by their false Splendour, by their foreign Luxury, by\r\ndespising Virtue, Religion and Temperance, and as fast as they can\r\ndrinking themselves out of the World, and sinking their Fortunes, in\r\nboth which they are faithfully copied, by their Inferiors. I have often\r\nthought while I was among them, that if our Gentlemen were oblig'd by\r\nLaw, to give in Accounts to the Publick of their annual Expences, as\r\nChildren do to their Parents, in order to have them regulated; what\r\nmiserable Oeconomists they wou'd appear to be, both for their own and\r\ntheir Country's Interests. The Article of Drinking is grown so immense,\r\nand at the same Time so general, that if some Fence is not provided for\r\nit soon, this Nation will be more in Danger from this Land-Flood, than\r\nthe _Dutch_ are from being overwhelm'd by the Ocean. What imbitters\r\nthese Reflections the more is, that tho' all our Exports are the very\r\nNecessaries of Life, which we send off to Feed and Cloath other\r\nNations, yet all our Imports, are the meer Superfluities of Luxury and\r\nVanity, that keep our Natives naked and starv'd, and ruin the Healths\r\nof those of the better Sort. I say ruin the Healths, for I believe, if\r\nyou and I, _Tom_, were to draw up a List of all our Acquaintances, who\r\nhave died Martyrs to Wine and good Fellowship, it wou'd look like a\r\n_London_ Plague-Bill in 1666. _Pharaoh_ and his Army wou'd appear but\r\nas an Handful to those I cou'd reckon up, within these last fifty\r\nYears, that have perish'd in this red Sea of Claret; and what Crowds\r\nare there, now creeping by this way alone, into Stone and Gout,\r\nRheumatisms, Palsies and Dropsies; after having by their Love of the\r\nBottle, exchang'd their Youth and their Strength, not for a short and a\r\nmerry Life, but a short and a miserable one.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. It is a terrible Thing to consider, if half the Money paid for\r\n_French_ Wine, was laid out in Building and Planting here, what a\r\nGarden they wou'd make of this whole Island; and instead of this, they\r\nmake the Bottle the Business of their Lives, and sacrifice to this\r\nnoble Passion, I will not say their Country, (for that no body minds)\r\nbut their Healths and their Fortunes as readily as their Reason. It is\r\nodd to me, Mr. _Dean_, if we must use foreign Wines, why we do not make\r\nthose of _Portugal_, _Spain_, _Italy_ and _Sicily_, cheap by low\r\nDuties, and the _French_ twice as dear by high ones; for by this means,\r\nwe cou'd get Drunk with the Loss of less Time, and Health, and Money.\r\nIf even such a Tax was laid on it, as would make its Consumption less\r\ngeneral, and hinder the poorer part of our People, from being ruin'd by\r\nthe dreadful Affectation, of drinking like the Men of Figure and\r\nFashion, it wou'd be an excellent Method; and above all if the\r\nadditional Taxes, were appropriated to extend the Linen Manufacture\r\nthro' the Southern Provinces. This wou'd soon enrich us, and impoverish\r\nat the same Time, the great Enemy to the repose of _Europe_; for 'tis\r\nby her Wines and our Money chiefly, that _France_ has been enabled, to\r\nsoar towards Universal Monarchy, and if this Feather was pluck'd from\r\nher, she wou'd soon shorten her Flights, and droop her Wings.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. You think extravagantly and wildly! You cheat yourself like most\r\nProjectors, with your own Dreams, and your Expectations are suited only\r\nto Citizens, who live and act, _Tanquam in Republica Platonis_. Can you\r\nbe so absurd as to hope, that Men in these Days, and in Manners like\r\nours, shou'd listen to Reason; and think our own Beer, Ale, Cyder, Mead\r\nand home Wines, fittest and best for themselves, their Friends and\r\ntheir Families? Can you imagine that this Age of Intemperance and\r\nLuxury, will think a while of these important Truths, instead of\r\npleasing their Palates, and driving off that heavy Load, their Time,\r\nwith the Roar of Jollity and Riot? Is it to be expected that good\r\nFellows and Pot Companions, will be influenced by a Regard for the\r\nWelfare of _Ireland_, when they will not value their own Healths, nor\r\navoid all the Distempers we lately reckon'd up, as well as all the\r\nnervous Disorders, that spring from the fatal Tartar, which Claret by\r\nsad Experience is found to abound with? I was weak enough, to read\r\nPhysick Books in my old Age, and I remember _Galen_ told me, that in\r\nall Wine there is something Indigestible in its self, and ruinous to\r\ntrue complete Concoction; but our best modern Physicians do also\r\nassert, that the Tartar in _French_ Wine, is the Fountain of a Crowd of\r\nPlagues and Pains, to our wretched Bodies. We read this in a Number of\r\nAuthors, and have the Tradition handed down, from the Records of the\r\nDead and the Living, who have suffered by neglecting such good Advice;\r\nbut where are the _Recabites_ that will listen to such Councils, in\r\nthese drinking Days.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. But as destructive as Wine is to us, we must not forget the\r\ndreadful Effects, Spirituous Liquors have on our Country and our\r\nBodies. They are really a sort of Liquid Flames, which corrode the\r\nCoats of the Stomach, thicken the Juices, and enflame the Blood, and in\r\na Word, absolutely subvert the whole Animal Oeconomy. The frequent use\r\nof them, has had as bad Effects on our poor Natives, as Gin in _Great\r\nBritain_; and besides driving many Wretches into Thefts, Quarrels,\r\nMurders and Robberies, it kills as many of the Poor, (when Drunk to\r\nexcess) as Wine does of the Rich. Even our own renowned _Whisky_, tho'\r\nit has banish'd the Brandies of _France_, yet is almost as pernicious\r\nto our Healths and our Morals; tho' we have this poor Comfort, since\r\nSpirituous Liquors we must have, that it is better to pay our _Irish_\r\nFarmers, for destroying us, (if we must be destroy'd) than the _French_\r\nVignarons about _Bourdeaux_.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I allow indeed our _Irish_ Spirits, are preferable to those made\r\nin _France_; but after all, the chief good Quality of them is, that the\r\nKing gets a prodigious encrease of his Revenue, by our Stills. It were\r\nto be wish'd, that this Part of his Majesty's Duties, that is founded\r\non the Intemperance of his People, was supplied by some other Tax; for\r\nit is dreadful to consider, how much the Crown is interested, that the\r\nSubject shou'd neither be frugal or sober. The Duty on our Spirits is\r\nthe best paid Money in the World, unless we except what we pay for our\r\nWine; for I think the only Debts we pay well, are to the Merchant who\r\nPoisons us, and the Sharpers who bubble us at Play. If I were alive, I\r\nwou'd write a Book against the dreadful Intemperance of this Age and\r\nthis Country; tho' I doubt if it wou'd do us much Service; for there is\r\na Time, when the noblest Medicines are of no Use in a Distemper, and I\r\nfear our political Diseases are now so desperate, that to die as easily\r\nas we can, and to put it off as long as we can, is all our poor Country\r\ncan hope for. I will therefore leave this, and go to another great\r\nObstacle to the welfare of _Ireland_, and that is the want of Tillage\r\namongst us.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. That is indeed, Mr. _Dean_, a terrible Evil, and like most of\r\nour Evils, chiefly owing to ourselves. We do not want this additional\r\nHardship to many others, that what we earn by our Labours in good\r\nYears, goes all from us in a scarce one, and leaves us either without\r\nFood or without Money.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Surely if repeated Sufferings make us patient, we might expect\r\nthat our frequent Misfortunes, might make us Wise; and yet Famines are\r\nnot able to oblige us to Plow, nor our Legislature to force us to it,\r\nby salutary Laws. One wou'd believe there were neither Thinkers or\r\nReasoners, (unpoison'd by French Wine) left in _Ireland_. Are we to be\r\na Nation of Beasts, and a few Savages to watch them, and only some\r\nLandlords and Butchers to divide the Spoil, and share the Plunder of a\r\nNation, wasted of its Villages and People, as _William Rufus_, serv'd\r\npart of _Kent_, to feed his Deer? Good God! what a Scandal are we\r\ngrowing, to all the Kingdoms of the Earth, that set up for a regulated\r\nGovernment, or a sensible equal Polity? Surely, _Tom_, Men with common\r\nSense, and common Industry, might make something else of this fertile\r\nCountry, than a wild solitary Extent of Pastures; and that Men and\r\ncivilized Creatures, might thrive here as well as Beasts and\r\nBarbarians; and that we need not let this poor Region, look like the\r\none ey'd _Polyphemus_'s Island, spoil'd of its Inhabitants, and\r\noccupied only by his Sheep and his Cattle? We all know, Grazing makes\r\nCountries wild and horrid, their People slothful and uncultivated as\r\nthe Soil; but one might bear any Fault but starving; and yet every\r\nthree or four Years, Men here are near famishing for want of Bread, and\r\nready to eat up each other, like Lord _Al----ms'_ Dogs in the Kennel.\r\nIt is hard to say, what sort of People we are, for it is strange that\r\nthe universal Instinct, that governs all the lower Ranks of Animals, or\r\nthat the great Law of Self-preservation, does not influence our\r\nCountrymen so far, as to provide their own Bread. Not to Insult us with\r\nwiser Nations, I wou'd at least expect, that we shou'd shew ourselves,\r\nas provident as the Republick of Ants, and keep something to preserve\r\nLife and Soul together, when Want and Winter come. We seem to be quite\r\nuninfluenced by Hopes or Fears, the two great ruling Passions of the\r\nSoul; and as merry and improvident, as so many Grass-hoppers. In other\r\nCountries if Sheep eat up Men, the Men have their Revenge and eat up\r\nSheep; but in _Ireland_, wretched, thoughtless _Ireland_, Sheep eat up\r\nmore Men than all the Wolves on the Earth, without our poor Natives,\r\nbeing able to devour one of them, but now and then, when we Steal them,\r\njust to keep Life and Soul together.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. The very Earth seems to cry out against us, Mr. _Dean_, for our\r\nwant of labouring it, as it is ready to reward the Industrious, with\r\nfertile Crops, and large Returns. He who will work up its natural\r\nStrength sufficiently, need never want Food or Raiment, or a good warm\r\nCabbin, to encourage him to go on, and by honest Care and Toils, in\r\nTime enrich himself and his Country. We observ'd before, that the Women\r\nwho were once the idlest part of our People, are now the most\r\nIndustrious; and if the Men will improve as fast at the Plow, as they\r\nhave done at the Wheel, we shou'd soon see a vast Change in our\r\nCircumstances. Our pinch'd miserable way of Living, wou'd be turn'd to\r\nPlenty and Neatness, Warmth and Health; and the Plow wou'd enliven the\r\nWheel and the Reel, and keep every Child, and every Sex in Motion. All\r\nthis we may hope from good and wise Governors; of such force is\r\nThinking for the Body, when the Body in return, will Work to make\r\nitself and the Mind easy. If our Rulers and Legislators, wou'd once\r\nheartily set about contriving, to get us Bread out of our own Fields,\r\nand oblige us by Laws to till the Ground sufficiently, we might soon\r\nsee our People and their Children, as busy as so many _Japonese_\r\nVillagers, when the Earth is loaded with their Harvests. However, I\r\nfear neither of these Things will be done, till we are forc'd to it, by\r\nseeing Twenty-Thousand poor Mortals starv'd once more, and twice as\r\nmany driven out of our Country; just as we see People seldom build\r\nBridges over the River, till they find Numbers of Travellers, have been\r\ndrown'd in Fording it.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. A Foreigner wou'd think it as absurd, to hear that our Natives\r\nwant Food, while we Export such amazing Quantities of Provisions; as\r\nthat the Commonalty round _Newcastle_, wanted Firing, tho' they furnish\r\n_London_ with their Coals. He wou'd ask, why we don't Tax such a mad\r\nExportation, and by laying Twelve-pence per Barrel, on all salted Beef\r\nand Pork, raise a Fund for Premiums, to the greatest Number of Acres\r\nplow'd in each County; that at least we may have Bread for our Natives,\r\nwho dare not hope for Flesh to eat with it. 'Tis a sad and a\r\nreproachful Prospect to us, to observe the _Chinese_ levelling\r\nMountains, banking in Rivers, and draining Morasses, to improve and\r\nDung them for the Plow; and to see in _Ireland_, as fertile Plains as\r\nany in the Earth, lying untill'd, and feeding Sheep and Bullocks,\r\ninstead of Men, of Industrious social thinking Creatures! The Plow is\r\nthe Cause that _China_ swarms with large Cities and Villages, and 'tis\r\nfrom the want of Tillage, that I remember to have seen in _Munster_,\r\nthe wretched Tenants, as ill-housed as so many _Hottentots_; which\r\nproceeds from the same Defect, the Country there is so little Populous.\r\nGreat Towns, and fair Villages, are not only the Strength and Ornament\r\nof any Country, but good Dwellings do naturally encrease Children, as a\r\nBarn does Mice, and from the same Reason too. Besides Buildings like\r\nthose in _China_, always bring Crowds of Artificers together, as they\r\nare sure of Business and Employment from them; and thence also the\r\nCountry too, must become thicker Planted and better Peopled; but in\r\n_Ireland_, all these Blessings are as hopeless, and as rare as Virtue,\r\nWisdom or Industry. Without Tillage properly follow'd and encourag'd,\r\n'tis impossible our Numbers will ever encrease sufficiently; nay they\r\nmust necessarily decline every Day; nor shall we be able to feed\r\ntolerably, those Remnants of our Countrymen, whom our Flocks of Sheep,\r\nand Herds of Bullocks, don't drive to _France_ and _America_, those\r\ngreat Drains of wretched _Ireland_. But what is fully as bad is, that\r\nwithout Tillage, we shall be perpetually drawing off what little Money\r\nwe have, and Bread will be so dear, that 'tis impossible but other\r\nNations who feed cheaper, must undersell us in our Manufactures.\r\nBesides how can there be any depending on stated Prices for our Goods,\r\nwhile Bread is constantly so fluctuating in its Value, as it is in\r\n_Ireland_; since the Wages of the Workmen, will ever depend on the\r\nPrice he pays for his Food? This is by the bye, a Circumstance, which\r\nmust for ever shut out the Linen Business from Munster, and all the\r\ngrazing Counties; it being absolutely impossible for it to subsist,\r\nwithout Tillage and Hands, which ever go together. It cannot be the\r\nProfit, that endears Grazing to the Southern Provinces; since many\r\nexcellent Authors, and particularly Mr. _Dobbs_, have clearly\r\ndemonstrated the vast Difference, betwixt Tillage and Grazing, as to\r\nthe real Gain by each; and it is clear we lose one Year with another,\r\n200,000_l._ to our Country, by this impolitick Turn to Stocks. This is\r\nenough in Conscience, one wou'd imagine for this unthinking Kingdom;\r\nbut we must add to this Loss also, the Multitudes, we force Abroad or\r\nstarve at Home, and the real Gain we shou'd make by their Arts and\r\nLabour, and the encrease of Houses, Marriages, Children, Health, Wealth\r\nand Plenty, which they naturally bring with them. If our wise Graziers\r\nwou'd once consider these Things, and that our Northern Colonies in\r\n_America_, are supplying those in the South with Beef, and threatning\r\nto beat us by Degrees out of that Trade, they will perceive how\r\nnecessary it is, to have a Law for Tillage, and that without it, we may\r\nsay with the _AEgyptians_, 'We be all dead Men.' This I am sure of, and\r\nI will only add that 'tis in vain to make Laws, for encouraging our\r\nLinen, or to expect to keep Money enough in our Kingdom, to pay our\r\nRents, or circulate Trade, when such prodigious Sums, go out annually\r\nfor Grain, by which, and the vast Importation of _French_ Wine, we are\r\nnow actually on the very Brink of Bankruptcy and Ruin.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I know no better way to convince any one, of the superior\r\nAdvantages, arising from Tillage, compar'd to those by Grazing, then to\r\nmake him consider the Circumstances of the People in _Ulster_, and\r\nthose in the other Provinces. In the first, all are laborious, all are\r\nwell Cloath'd, well Fed, well Housed and Taught; in the last, all Lazy,\r\nNaked, Starv'd, Lodg'd in dirty Hutts, and almost Illiterate. The\r\nsuperior Advantages which the North so eminently enjoys, proceed not so\r\nmuch from the different Genius's, of the two opposite Religions, which\r\nprevail there, and in the South, (tho' that is something) but from\r\nTillage and Labour, and all the Arts 'tis employ'd in, being fixt in\r\n_Ulster_. This shews the Care we shou'd take, to encourage Tillage in\r\nthis half starv'd Island, and the wisest Nations have ever thought they\r\ncou'd not take too much about it. _Aulus Gellius_ tells us, that the\r\nwise _Romans_ kept Inspectors, over the Agriculture of their People,\r\nwho took due Care, that every one manag'd their Grounds, in the most\r\nskilful and useful Manner, and to instruct the Ignorant and punish the\r\nRefractory. At this Day, _Pere du Halde_ assures us, that the _Chinese_\r\ndo in the most rigid Manner, oblige every one to sow their Grounds or\r\nforfeit them; and they appoint judicious Surveyors, who every Year,\r\nmake Returns to the Magistrates, of the several Plow-Lands, and their\r\ndifferent Fertility. This may convince us, what these two wise Nations\r\nthought, of the Benefit of Agriculture; and if any Thing cou'd make us\r\nrenounce our destructive Passion for Grazing, one might tell them, that\r\n'tis recommended by him that made the Earth, in many Passages of holy\r\nWrit; and if you remember, _Moses_ also Assigns it, as one Reason for\r\nGod's creating _Adam_, That Man was wanted to Till the Ground. When I\r\nwas talking of the _Roman_ and _Chinese_ Inspectors of their Tillage, I\r\nshou'd have mention'd that the _Jews_ had such also; for we find the\r\nNames of those who in _David_'s Time, were Superintendants of such\r\nMatters, recorded in the [3]_Chronicles_. Possibly in these blessed\r\nTimes for Acting and Thinking freely, we shou'd not relish such\r\nDictators to the Plow, nor any penal Laws to enforce our Tillage; but\r\ncertain I am, that without some Laws that will execute themselves, (how\r\naverse soever we may be to them) we shall still continue in the utmost\r\nDanger of Beggary and Famine. We may very well submit, even to such\r\ncompulsatory Laws in this Kingdom, since every one may read in our\r\nHistories, that _England_ was often oblig'd, to force her Subjects to\r\nreturn to the Plow, when the lazy Method of pasturing Cattle, had\r\ndistrest that Kingdom; and 'tis chiefly to the Statutes made by the two\r\nlast _Henries_ and _Edward_ the VIth, that she owes the Blessing, of\r\nher being now the Granary of _Europe_, and of her enjoying the\r\nAdvantages of having improv'd her Agriculture, beyond all other\r\nNations. It is to be hop'd, if our late Act to encrease our Tillage,\r\nwas properly amended, and form'd so as to make the Recovery of the\r\nPenalties more easy, it wou'd have very happy Effects here; as\r\nAgriculture is the Source of Plenty, and the nursing Mother of Arts and\r\nManufactures. We observ'd before, that to see Beggars in any well\r\nregulated State, is a reproach to its Laws and Government; but to see a\r\nNation of Beggars, is too scandalous to have it exemplified in any\r\nKingdom but _Ireland_; and yet without an effectual Law for Tillage,\r\nthat must unquestionably be our Misfortune for a while, and in some\r\nYears our Ruin. I am at a Loss how to account for this universal\r\nConspiracy to destroy ourselves, which is the more alarming, as our own\r\nPlots against our own Happiness generally succeed. Have we made a Vow\r\nof Poverty, like the Capuchin Friars, or have we entred into a\r\nConfederacy to enrich every Country but our own? For if not, whence\r\ncomes it, that above all other Nations we have the finest Ports,\r\nwithout Ships or Trade, the greatest Number of able Hands, without any\r\ncare of Employing them, and that we are blest with so many Millions, of\r\nrich arable Acres without Plowing them, and such Numbers of Men of Rank\r\nand Fortune, without proper Zeal or Spirit, to remedy these Evils which\r\nwe groan under? But there are two Instances of our Folly as to Tillage,\r\nthat I cannot pass by. The first is, that we chuse the North, for the\r\nmain Store-House of the Kingdom, where we have not only the barrenest\r\nLands, but the worst Seasons, and where the Wet and Bleakness of the\r\nCountry, produce tardy Harvests, fierce Winds and heavy Rains; and\r\nwhere the Ground is not near so fit for the Production of Wheat, as the\r\nrich Plains of our other Provinces, that lye nearer to the Sun. The\r\nother Instance of our Folly, is our rejecting in the Year 1710, the\r\nBill transmitted from _England_, that allowed a large Premium for our\r\nexported Corn, which wou'd have been the greatest Encouragement to our\r\nTillage, and consequently the greatest Blessing to this unfortunate\r\nKingdom. I will not reckon up the Millions it wou'd have sav'd us, that\r\nhave since gone out for Bread; nor those it wou'd have gain'd us, by\r\nthe encrease of our Manufactures, and the keeping busy at Home, all the\r\nHands we have been depriv'd of by subsequent Famines; but I will say\r\nthis, that as our Zeal for his Majesty's Succession, our dread of the\r\nPretender, and our Jealousy of the Duke of _Ormond_'s popular Arts,\r\nmade us then throw out that Act; so it is to be hop'd, that the King\r\nwill in the Generosity of his Soul, restore us that desireable Bill\r\nwhich we lost for him.\r\n\r\n      [3] _1 Chronicles, 27. ch. v. 25 and 26._\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I heartily wish it, Mr. _Dean_, and tho' we had then a Lord\r\nLieutenant highly regarded by the Ministry, favour'd by the Queen, and\r\ngreatly belov'd in _Ireland_, yet it is as true, that we have one at\r\npresent, who is not inferior to him in those Advantages, and vastly\r\nsuperior to him in others; and who certainly has as sincere a desire to\r\nserve us, as ever possest a _Boulter_, a _Berkeley_ or a _Swift_, for I\r\nwill not presume to join my Name with such Patriots. I hope we shall\r\nfind it so by Experience, but whenever he does procure us that\r\nBlessing, if he wou'd complete our Obligations to him, and endear\r\nhimself for ever to _Ireland_, he must add to it, the establishing\r\nGranaries in _Dublin_, _Cork_, and such Parts of the Kingdom, where\r\nthey will be the most useful to those great Ends, the keeping Bread at\r\na fix'd Price, as well as our Manufactures, and the Wages of those who\r\nWork them, whose Labour must ever depend on their Food. Without these,\r\nwe must live dependent on Accidents, Winds and Seasons, and the Mercy\r\nof Corn-Factors; and as both the old _Jews_ and the old _Romans_, had\r\nsuch Store-Houses, and the wisest Governments in _Europe_, made use of\r\nthem with the exactest Providence, and to the greatest Advantage under\r\nproper Regulations; surely we shall not be depriv'd of such Blessings\r\nlong. They are the great security to the Welder, that his Grain shall\r\nbear a fair encouraging Price, and at the same Time a Restraint on the\r\nrapacious Avarice of the Farmer, and the Corn-Chandler abroad and at\r\nHome; and as by being furnish'd in cheap Years, and all Exportations\r\nstopt till they're fill'd, they wou'd keep a fair Balance on the Price\r\nof Bread, he who desires to be bless'd by the Poor and the Industrious\r\nhere, will not fail to add this Favour to all that we hope to receive\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I don't like praying to Saints that must pray to others. Our\r\nbest Way is to address his Majesty for whatever we stand in need of;\r\ntho' after all, what can we hope _England_ will do for us, who sees our\r\nWants, knows what has occasioned them, and what would relieve them, and\r\nyet takes not the least Step to serve us. This single Circumstance\r\nlooks with an ill-omen'd Aspect on the Affairs of _Ireland_, and is\r\nanother main Reason, which I must offer to you, why I think our Days of\r\nProsperity are as far off as the great _Platonick_ Year.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I have often thought, Mr. _Dean_, our Clamours against _England_\r\nvery ill grounded, tho' many, who know they are false or foolish, are\r\napt, for no good Ends, to encourage them. 'Tis to _England_ that we owe\r\nthat we are yet a Nation, that we are Freemen and Protestants, and\r\nenjoy our civil and religious Rights, by the same Zeal and Efforts\r\nwhich secured their own. They have left large Branches of Trade and\r\nManufactures open to us; and even our Linen and our Fisheries, our\r\nTillage and our Collieries, our Salt-works, and our Mines, (not to\r\nmention many others) would employ most of the idle Hands in the\r\nKingdom, if we would once set vigorously about them. Can we be so\r\nunreasonable as to expect she will distress her own Natives, to\r\nencourage those in _Ireland_, as if they had not Sense to consider,\r\nthat their Charity, as well as ours, should ever begin at home? It can\r\nnever be denied, that they have done largely for us, if we would do\r\nsomething to help ourselves, with proper Industry, and an eager Zeal to\r\nserve our Country. They do not hinder us to save 300000 _l._ _per\r\nAnnum_, by using our own Woollen and Silken Manufactures, our own Salt,\r\nour own Sugar, our own Grain, Hops and Coals, Ale, Cyder, Bark and\r\nCheese, our own Iron and Iron-ware, Paper and Glass; and if we will not\r\nwork them up, nor use them when wrought, are they to be blamed, or we?\r\nWould you have them make a Law to prohibit the Importation of such\r\nThings to _Ireland_, and force us to use our Hands for our own Wants,\r\nwhether we will or no?\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I wish they would; it would be of infinite Service to this poor\r\nCountry, which they impoverish by the wasteful Consumption of _English_\r\nGoods, that devour our Money, and deaden our Industry. That we owe many\r\nBlessings to _England_, I never doubted, even when I was alive, and as\r\nfar as was in her Power, disgraced and maltreated by her, and much less\r\nshall I dispute it now. However, I can reckon up a large Catalogue of\r\nComplaints and Distresses, which _Ireland_ can very justly charge her\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Allowing all this to be true, as, to my Sorrow, I see you have\r\nsome Grounds for your Assertion; are they to be reviled or envy'd for\r\nsending us their Goods, if we are so mad as to call for them? Would you\r\nhave them hinder your buying their Commodities? Or, to go a little\r\nfurther, would we be hinder'd if they did? If we cut our own Throats,\r\nin our own wise Judgments, would you have them make a Law to gibbet us\r\nfor it after we are dead? I allow you many of our Murmurings are just;\r\nbut for the Love of Truth and Goodness, let us lament our Case with\r\nsome Sense, and begin at the right End with railing at ourselves. I do\r\nnot deny, that we are much impoverish'd by their Importations, nay,\r\nthat by them we are in some Sense of the Word, Beggars; But, dear\r\n_Dean_, who ever hated Beggars more than you did, that had Health and\r\nHands, and could work and help themselves, and would not. If our People\r\nwill neither set up Manufactures, nor encourage them when set up, if\r\nthey will not promote Agriculture by large Premiums through the\r\nKingdom, but had rather beg Bread from their industrious Neighbours; if\r\nthey will neither build Granaries, or set up Fisheries or Collieries:\r\nIf Gentlemen will neither live at home, nor build and improve their\r\nEstates, to tempt their Sons to live there; if they see Societies set\r\nup for the Service of _Ireland_, and won't spare Shillings a-piece from\r\ntheir Diversions, to increase their Force and Power to help us, are the\r\n_English_ to be blamed, or ourselves, if they leave it to our Choice\r\neither to mend our Follies, or to suffer by them.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. The Truth is (though I am loth to confess it) I fear we are too\r\nlazy, because we are not extraordinarily encouraged, either here or by\r\n_England_; and probably they want to see us more alert, before they\r\nhelp us further; and in the mean time, between our Gentlemen who go\r\nabroad for Pleasure, and our Poor for Bread, we are like a Ship that is\r\nrun a-ground, and the Hands which should have saved her gone off.\r\nPeople that are unfortunate love to have some one to lay the Blame on;\r\nand so we rail at _England_, as I remember Mrs. _Halley_ (the Wife of\r\nthe famous Astronomer) did at the Stars, who used to wring her Hands,\r\nand bawl out, My Curse, and God's Curse upon them for Stars, for they\r\nhave ruined me and my Family; whereas, like _Job_'s Wife, she ought to\r\nhave cursed her Husband for his star-gazing Folly. At the same Time I\r\nnever did, nor ever will forgive _England_ for not helping us more than\r\nshe does: We are a Mint in her Hands, but through her Negligence or\r\nDiffidence it is an unwrought one, though the Ore is vastly rich and\r\npromising.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I must agree with you there, and yet I am convinced, that the\r\nFear of making their own People jealous, the Weight of their Debts,\r\ntheir violent Parties, and their decayed Trade, prevent their doing all\r\nthey would for us or themselves; the Charity, the unbounded Charity,\r\n_England_ extended to us at the Revolution, her Encouragement to our\r\nLinens, our Woollen Yarn, and our Cambricks, and to name no more, her\r\nBenefactions to our Charter-Schools, are Evidences of her Love to us\r\nwhich can never be forgotten. But beside all this, if _England_ has a\r\nZeal for her own Welfare, she must have a good Will for ours; for she\r\nknows and feels every Improvement made in _Ireland_, that does not\r\ndirectly clash with her Interest, is pouring Treasure into her own Lap,\r\nas regularly as what the River gets is returned to the Ocean. 'Tis\r\nevident, if we are better cloath'd, peopled, fed, and housed here; if\r\nour Wealth be encreased, or our Inhabitants or Country improved, we\r\nshall of Course take off more of her Goods, and spend more of our Money\r\nin _London_, which is to all Intents and Purposes, as much our\r\nMetropolis as _England_'s. We already, by the mending of our\r\nCircumstances in some Respects, and the raising our Rents, do actually\r\nspend thrice as much there as our Grandfathers did; and it is as plain\r\na Truth, that our Grandchildren will hereafter redouble what we carry\r\nthere now. Can there be a Doubt then, that _England_ must consult our\r\nWelfare, as long as she attends to her own? Though we live in different\r\nIslands, we are in effect but one People, and generally Children of the\r\nsame Family; all we want to make us happy together is, that the elder\r\nBrother should carry to us with Affection and Regard and we to him with\r\nRespect and Deference, without Jealousies or Quarrels for Trifles or\r\nThings that cannot be helped, we never interfering with them, nor they\r\noppressing or cramping us.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. You are a very civil Magistrate, as _St. John_ says, and have\r\nadjusted Things very amicably; but there is another Reason for\r\n_England_'s protecting us, which I cannot pass by, and that is because\r\nany bold Step of the Crown in future Ages to absolute Power, will\r\nprobably begin here. 'Tis therefore to be hoped, our Brethren in\r\n_Great-Britain_, who (whatever may become of them) are not born Slaves\r\nlike some People I won't name, will watch us like a Beacon, whenever\r\nbad or weak Men set this poor Island on Fire, either to plunder or to\r\nfrighten it, or for any other noble political Scheme. I must own,\r\n_Tom_, while I was playing the Fool in the World, like my Neighbours, I\r\nused to rail at _England_ severely, and I had my Reasons for it; but\r\nthough I am altered much as to that Point, there are several Things\r\nthat I still think her blameable in, and particularly for the small\r\nNumber of _Irishmen_ that are preferred in Church and State. The Want\r\nof all proper Encouragement here, for every Man's exerting his\r\nAbilities as far as they can go, has terrible Effects on the very\r\nGenius and Character of our Nation. It actually keeps our Schools\r\nunfill'd, and thins our College to a surprising Degree; and makes our\r\nPeople look on the little Virtue we have yet kept among us, as useless\r\nand impertinent in a Country, where they are out of Fashion, and where\r\nAlliance, and Blood, and Family-Interest, make our Constitution in\r\nChurch and State, (and especially the Church) rather hereditary than\r\nelective. This is a great national Grievance, so as to make it a Sort\r\nof Misfortune to be born here; nor do I see any Hopes of a Remedy,\r\nunless we get a Bill of Naturalization past on the other Side of the\r\nWater for all _Irishmen_, as well as for the _Jews_. At present there\r\nis as little Encouragement for Knowledge, or the learned Arts in\r\n_Ireland_, as in the _Isle of Man_, or rather less; for though their\r\nPreferments and Posts are fewer, they are only bestowed on Natives. By\r\nthis Means it will come to pass in Time, that our Parts must be as\r\nslight as our Encouragements, and poor as our Country; for here, as in\r\nthe dead Level of the Ocean, there is no Rising but by Storms and\r\nTempests, and the Miseries and Ruins they occasion; and therefore half\r\nour Gentry owe their Estates to the Wars and Rebellions of Madmen and\r\nBigots. But as to Eminence in Learning, or distinguish'd Abilities,\r\nthey are quite overlook'd; or at least the Handful, that _Ireland_ has\r\nseen preferred of her Natives by them, is miserably small. In other\r\nNations some, nay, Crowds, are advanced by their Knowledge and Talents,\r\nbut here they are discountenanced and brow-beaten; some are enriched by\r\nTrade, but here all we have is contrived to ruin us: Some make large\r\nFortunes by their Skill in the Laws, but with us, where Plaintiffs or\r\nDefendants are one or other of them Beggars, the Proverb will tell you\r\nwhat is got by the Suit. I must add to all these Complaints, that even\r\nAvarice cannot bring a Man in _Ireland_ a moderate Acquisition of\r\nWealth; for here all Men do so universally outlive their Circumstances,\r\nthat Saving is grown as scandalous as Thieving, and a Man is hooted out\r\nof the World more frequently for the one, than he is hanged for the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. It is easier, Mr. _Dean_, to exclaim on this Head, than to shew\r\nthe Justice of the Complaint; for whoever will carefully look over the\r\nLists of those who have been preferred in Church and State for some\r\nYears, will find there has been greater Attention than ever paid to\r\nthis Matter. But lest you should dispute this Fact, I will only hint,\r\nthat there are Grounds to say, this Complaint will not be so common a\r\nTopick of Discourse with _Irishmen_, as we knew it in our Time; and\r\nprobably as Learning and Knowledge may therefore make greater Advances\r\namong us than ever, we shall find _Irishmen_ hereafter as much\r\ndistinguished by their Preferments as their Merit. But however that may\r\nbe, it will be as great Madness for us to malign or revile _England_ on\r\nsuch Disgusts and Slights, as for a younger Son to quarrel with his\r\nFather, to whom he owes his being what he is, and who may in Time\r\nvastly enlarge his Portion and his Happiness, if he behaves with Duty\r\nand Love. This I will be bold to say, that we are possess'd of as many\r\ncivil Advantages, under our Connections with _England_, as we enjoy\r\nfrom our natural ones, and our Situation in this Climate, this Sun, and\r\nthis World of Life and Matter, where we derive so many Blessings from\r\nthe Bounty of the Creator.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I wish, _Tom_, you would not stir that Bone of Contention, for\r\nthere is a great deal to be said on both Sides of the Question, which,\r\nas I love to keep in good Humour, and be as quiet in my Grave as I can,\r\nI do not care for wrangling about. But this I must say, as to your\r\nHints of our being Children of the same Family, that you had better let\r\nthem alone, for it stirs my Spleen too violently. I am sure, if we are\r\nso, we fare like the rest of the younger Children in the World, who get\r\nbut a Pittance to starve on, while the elder Brother runs away with the\r\nBulk of the Fortune. I will not dwell on what we lose to her by\r\nAbsentees, but I know between our Wool, our Woollen and Worsted Yarn,\r\nour Linens and Linen Yarn, our Copper, Lead, and Iron Ore, our Hides,\r\nSkins, Tallow, all which are the Primums and Foundations of her great\r\nManufactures, she makes immense Gains by her Trade with our Country,\r\nand the Ships she employs in it. I must also add, that we take from her\r\nthe largest Supplies of her Grain and her Manufactures of any Nation\r\nupon Earth; and besides the Crowds of _English_ Gentlemen, that are\r\npossess'd of Employments, Commissions, Pensions, and Preferments here,\r\nshe makes near two Millions by the Trade with _Ireland_; which I know\r\nis more than she gains from the rest of the World. I am not peevish, or\r\nat least so peevish, as I used to be, when I had vile Flesh and Blood\r\nabout me; but these are plain confest honest Truths, and if that\r\ngenerous large thoughted Nation, will consider them calmly and\r\ncandidly; possibly she will make us other Returns, than cramping our\r\nTrade, making us poor Petitioners, for leave to live by our Linen, and\r\nbinding us by Laws (a Thing which every _Briton_ shou'd start at) to\r\nwhich we never gave our Consent.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I cannot enter on that Subject, without irritating you, and\r\ntherefore, Mr. _Dean_, I will drop it; but this I must say, that\r\n_England_ had probably shewn us more Affection and Indulgence, if she\r\nhad not been kept in perpetual Alarms, by our endeavouring to Rival her\r\nin her great Staple, the Woollen Trade. I have heard of some Women, who\r\nto regain their Husband's Affections, strove to make them Jealous; but\r\nI fancy that is no good Artifice, to make Nations love one another, and\r\nI hope as our Linen Manufactures, and our Tillage encrease in the\r\nSouth; we shall remove all uneasiness from that Quarter. It is certain\r\nour Interests and _England_'s are inseparably united, and he must be a\r\nvery weak, or a very malicious Man, who wou'd endeavour to divide our\r\nInclinations, and set up a Wall Partition between us; by keeping up\r\nartificial Jealousy on the one Side, and unnatural Aversion on the\r\nother. It wou'd be absurd to think that because we have a broader Arm\r\nof the Sea, between us and _England_ than the _Isle of Wight_, or\r\n_Anglesea_; that therefore we ought to have, different Rules and Views\r\nof Acting; whereas we shou'd consider ourselves as one People, join'd\r\nin one System of Government, Religion, Laws and Liberties; and he that\r\ndivides us Ruins us.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. What dost thou talk of dividing us? I hope that Word was not\r\naim'd at me. I am not for Divisions (nor let me whisper you in the Ear,\r\n_Tom_) Unions either, till I see more Cause. But in the mean Time, I\r\nsay since _England_ makes so much by _Ireland_, she ought to help us to\r\nget something for ourselves, if it was for no other Reason but to\r\ndouble her Gain by us. But it is amazing how a Nation so sensible and\r\nenterprizing as she is generally allow'd to be, can so long over look\r\nthe vast Advantages she might draw from us, if we were cultivated and\r\nimprov'd under her Direction. Can she be Ignorant how useful, so large\r\nand so fertile a Country may be to her, where Hands and Food are so\r\neasily had, and may be turn'd to every Manufacture she wants, as\r\neffectually as the Motion of an Army by a skilful General. And if she\r\nknows it, can she neglect it? Does she want to be told, where she may\r\nmost properly and providently give all the vast Sums she pays, for\r\nHempen and Linen Manufactures to our Neighbours round the _Baltick_?\r\nDoes she understand what Gain she wou'd make, if the Lands here were\r\nraised by Trade and Manufactures, to a Million more than they now set\r\nfor, and how soon this may be done? Is she yet to learn, that by\r\nencouraging the Woollen Business here, in such Articles only, as her\r\nRivals undersell her in, she wou'd effectually recover them out of\r\ntheir Hands, by employing the _Irish_, who by paying no Taxes on their\r\nMilk and Potatoes, can undersell the World? Is she Ignorant what she\r\nmight make, by compleatly working our Mines, by opening our Trade to\r\nher Plantations effectually, and to Name no more by setting up extended\r\nFisheries here, (the Gain from which one wou'd be tempted to think, was\r\nhinted by _Christ_'s bidding St. _Peter_, take Money out of the Fishes\r\nMouth) and thereby besides the Profit of what we vend, breeding\r\nThousands of Mariners to man her Navy. If these are certain Facts, I\r\nhope you will allow me without Grumbling, to assert two plain Truths;\r\nfirst that there never was a Nation so Affectionate, so Loyal as\r\n_Ireland_; and secondly, That there never was a rebellious People so\r\nmuch suspected, so long neglected, and so saintly, so coldly encourag'd\r\nto serve her.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Tho' I cannot agree with you, Mr. _Dean_, in some of these\r\nParticulars, yet I will avoid Wrangling with an old Friend; but I must\r\nsay you are too ready to lay blame upon _England_; when our own People\r\nare more to be reproach'd than our Neighbours, who have more Affairs of\r\ntheir own on their Hands, than they can get well manag'd. If we fairly\r\nweigh Things, we will find our Countrymen faulty in many Regards; and\r\nindeed I have such a Bead-roll of Accusations against them, that I know\r\nnot where I had best begin the Attack.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Hold! _Tom_, hold! Dead or Living, I wou'd never allow any Man\r\nto attack _Ireland_, but myself; however when I am out of Breath, you\r\nshall be permitted to assist me now, and then. I must ingeniously own,\r\nI see so many Mistakes in their ways of Thinking and Acting, that the\r\nmore I consider them, the more I look on _Ireland_, as in a dangerous\r\nCondition. The first Thing I shall touch at, is that terrible want of\r\npublick Spirit, which we are notoriously defective in; tho' like the\r\nPulse in the human Body, where it is wanting, Death is nigh! all\r\nCountries are greatly help'd by this noblest Passion of the human Mind:\r\nBut this Island must be absolutely lost, without its Assistance. We are\r\nso Circumstanced in several Views, that nothing can keep us above\r\nWater, and much less make us flourish, but the whole of our Gentry,\r\njoining one and all, to rouse themselves and the Nation, by encouraging\r\nevery Art, every additional Method of employing us, that they can\r\nsettle here. And yet how few have I known, who exerted themselves this\r\nway, or seem'd to know it was their Interest, or to think it their\r\nDuty. I remember in some Accounts of _Portugal_, I have met a Relation\r\nof the vast Good that is done there, by the famous merciful Society, as\r\nthey call it very deservedly. It is composed of the most distinguish'd\r\nPersons in the Kingdom, who all contribute their Quota's to the\r\nrelieving in a private Manner, all deserving People, (and Tradesmen\r\nespecially) who are in want. The Steward who is annually Chosen, is\r\nalways one of the most Illustrious of the Nobility; and cannot avoid\r\nspending 5000 _l._ in these Charities, to come off with Honour, and\r\nkeep up the Glory of his Trust. Now I will venture to affirm, tho' we\r\nhave vastly the Superiority over _Portugal_, as to the Numbers of\r\nNoblemen and Gentlemen of great Fortunes in _Ireland_; yet it wou'd be\r\na vain Attempt to endeavour to establish such a generous Society here.\r\nThis makes me Tremble for a People so deserted and neglected as ours;\r\nfor unless the Rich, and the Great, and the Powerful, give largely to\r\nthe Encouragement of Arts and Industry, and set Examples of Virtue and\r\nGoodness, and a Love of their Country before us, there can be little\r\nhopes of this or any other Nation, being made completely easy or happy.\r\nMen of larger Fortunes, shou'd shew they have larger Hearts than\r\nothers, or they ought like the old _Romans_ to suffer a voluntary\r\nDegradation, and descend from their State and mix with the meanest\r\n_Plebeians_. If they Act so as to do Honour to their Ancestors, and\r\ngive shining Proofs of Truth, Piety, Worth and Benevolence; Numbers\r\nwill Copy them with Joy; but without this, we may as well expect an\r\nArmy will be brave, where the Generals, Colonels and Captains are\r\nCowards, as that a Nation shall shew publick Spirit, or be Virtuous,\r\nReligious and Charitable, where their Superiors have opposite\r\nCharacters. Let all who are eminent for Wealth or Birth, or Parts,\r\nseriously lay this to Heart, and consider how much the Immorality and\r\nMisery, or the Virtue and Prosperity of their Country, is chargeable to\r\nthem and their Conduct; and it will not fail of stirring up a generous\r\nEmulation, who shall be most distinguish'd, in assisting the whole of\r\nour People, in Thinking and Acting better, and more nobly than they\r\nhave hitherto done.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. That too few have Acted thus, must be acknowledg'd; but some\r\nthere have been among them, who have done Honour to their Families, and\r\nraised their own Characters, by the applauded Parts they have Acted,\r\nfor the Service of their Country.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. At the same Time, _Tom_, one wou'd wonder such Examples shou'd\r\nnot be more frequent; for how dreadful how contemptible a Figure, in\r\nthe sight of God and Man, must he make, who with the Advantages of\r\nBirth, and Fortune, and Power, seems to labour to be remembred, Living\r\nand Dead, only for being given up to the basest and most brutal Vices,\r\nor at best for his senseless Splendour, by living like an _Epicure_, or\r\nacting the Gamester, or for his great Stables or well-cover'd Table,\r\nhis well-fill'd Cellar, or to heighten his Character still higher, his\r\nDebts and his Drabs. Such Men ruin and corrupt the World, by their\r\nExamples; they sneer at Virtue and Sobriety, they make a Jest of loving\r\nor serving this poor Island, and Ridicule the very Name of a Patriot;\r\nand while they withhold their Contribution, to every good Design, they\r\nmake Sport of lavishing their Fortunes in Folly, and ruining their\r\nConstitution by Vice, and they even Laugh at Religion, and shew an\r\nequal Contempt for their God and their Country. It is odd, that few can\r\nbe Stupid enough not to see, that every Man's private Interest and\r\nHappiness, let him be ever so great, is involv'd in that of the\r\nPublick; and yet few or none will Labour to serve the Publick, so far\r\nas to think for or support its Interest, whenever they have an\r\nOpportunity. I labour'd to rouse it up amongst us, for a Number of\r\nYears, to no Purpose, and I am apprehensive, that our best Ground to\r\nhope, to see this Spirit revive here, is that Posterity may hereafter\r\nexert it effectually, when they see this Island ruin'd; by the little\r\nRegard that is shewn for it now. However I must say (if any Thing in\r\n_Ireland_ were worth complaining about) that it is a little hard, we\r\nmust be Ruin'd before we are reform'd, just as Shipwrecks set up\r\nLight-houses, to secure future Sailors in their Voyages. This wou'd\r\nenrage one, _Tom_, if a noble Scorn did not cool our Fury.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. These Thoughts disturb the Breasts of the Dead, as well as the\r\nPassions of the Living; for it is certain if our higher People shew'd a\r\ntrue publick Spirit, it wou'd produce vast Effects amongst us; it wou'd\r\nstir up Invention, Industry and Emulation, and in a Word awaken every\r\nGenius, every useful Man in this Kingdom. We have had very\r\nextraordinary Persons Born and Educated here, and we wou'd have them\r\nstill, if our Leaders wou'd make use of that plain Method, by proper\r\nPremiums to raise Seed-Beds and Nurseries for them, and use our Youth\r\nto think, and to excell. How easily might they call out every one's\r\nbest Qualities, to the properest Purposes, and encourage every Man, who\r\nfinds he has the Seeds of Virtue, the Power of Thinking and Acting for\r\nhimself or others, and a proper force of Mind, to try how far his\r\nAbilities can go. If this can't be brought about, and if for want of\r\nsuch a miserable Stock of common Sense and common Virtue in _Ireland_,\r\nwe are to be left to ourselves, and employ'd in doing nothing but\r\nmaking a little Linen, I can only say, we are the most negligent and\r\nneglected People under Heaven.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Ah _Tom! Tom!_ what must we think of our Physicians, where our\r\nDiseases are so dangerous and are yet so manageable, and where the\r\nRemedies are so easy and parable? Where nothing but slighting our\r\nDisorders can make our Cure doubtful, and where they give over the\r\nPatient barely for want of being feed? What must become of a Country,\r\nwhere about 600,000 _l._ of its Rents are annually spent Abroad, by a\r\nCrowd of Parricides, which we call Absentees; where as much more is\r\nspent at home, in foreign Growths or Manufactures by _Irish_ Suicides,\r\nand the rest is laid out in Dress and Equipage, in Gaming and Drinking,\r\nand Horse-Racing, except a Pittance that is scrambled for, by our\r\nLabourers and Workmen to buy Potatoes and Whisky, and once in a Month,\r\nhalf a Peck of Meal for the Children of the Nation. What will become of\r\na Kingdom, whose Manufactures are the Scorn of its own Inhabitants; who\r\nwill not Drink of their own Liquors, write on their own Paper, or be\r\nfed with their own Bread, as I observ'd before, and can't observe too\r\noften: Nay, where the Poor by giving into these fine Fashions, seem as\r\nwell inclin'd to destroy us as the Rich? What must become of a Nation\r\nof Beggars, and none to relieve them? What must become of a Country,\r\nwhere the common People make as much Interest, to be put on the List of\r\nthe Parish Poor, and be authorized to Starve upon Charity; as their\r\nLandlords, and 'Squires do to get a Place or a Sallary, to make amends\r\nto them, for outrunning their Fortunes, and to appear like dignified\r\nBeggars, who for ruining themselves and the Nation, are Nursed at the\r\npublick Charge, as the _Athenians_ used to keep their true Patriots, in\r\nthe _Areopagus_ on Pension, when old and reduced in their Service.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why indeed, Mr. _Dean_----\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Indeed, _Tom_, I have not done, nor I won't be interrupted. I\r\nsay what will become of a Nation, where we are charg'd so immensely for\r\nunbuilt or ill-built Barracks, for our Soldiers which we cannot use,\r\nwhich we did not want; and where we won't lay out a necessary Expence\r\nto build Houses of Correction, that wou'd force every Idler to Labour,\r\nand tho' we know that Idleness is the Seed of Rebellion? What will\r\nbecome of a Nation, where we spend immensely to ruin it, and grudge\r\nlaying out a few Shillings, or the smallest Tax to serve it, by\r\nencouraging our People to Labour and be Industrious? Where we are grown\r\nso heedless and unthinking, that our political Creed, must be as often\r\nrepeated in our Ears, as our Religious one, before we will take care to\r\nunderstand, or shew we believe it by our Practice? Where we are so\r\nnotoriously Dull, or so artificially Insensible, that we must be told\r\nour true Interest a thousand Times over, before we'll regard it, or\r\nwhere those who know our true Interest best, will Sacrifice it either\r\nto their Vanity, Ease, Pleasure or Ambition, or at least to their\r\ngiddy, senseless, Carelessness? What must become of a Kingdom, where we\r\nare grown so resign'd, that we no more offer to complain of the\r\nhardness of our Case, if two or three honest Gentlemen bid us hold our\r\nTongue, than a dying Man against the Will of Heaven? Where we either\r\nseem to have lost the Sense of Groaning by the length of our Distemper,\r\nor by knowing from long Experience, it will be in vain; or else that we\r\nfear bawling, as in the House of Correction, will but increase the\r\nBlows, both as to Number and Smart. Where People keep their Tongues in\r\ntheir Pockets, as Highway-Men do their Pistols, never to be pull'd out\r\nbut in hopes of getting Money; and where so many, of our most eminent\r\nGuardians and Representatives, command Men to be silent and quiet and\r\nbear all, as the Executioner said to Don [4]_Carlos_, when he was\r\nstruggling to hinder his being Strangled, ''Tis for your good Don\r\n_Carlos_! be quiet, 'tis for your Good!' Nay what will become of a\r\nNation, where whoever Attempts to help it, is either mark'd out for\r\nDestruction, as I was by a certain Lord Chief Justice, or revil'd and\r\nhated.\r\n\r\n      [4] _The King of_ Spain_'s son put to Death privately by his\r\n      Order._\r\n\r\nPRIOR. There _Dean_, you must give me leave to say, you certainly go\r\ntoo far, to hate our Benefactors is not in human Nature.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Whether 'tis in human Nature I know not, but I am sure 'tis in\r\n_Ireland_; for I found myself hated there sincerely by different\r\nPeople, and for different Reasons. I was actually hated, by all who\r\ncou'd help it, but would not or durst not, and by all who wou'd help it\r\nthemselves and knew not how, and abhorr'd to have it done by others. I\r\nwas hated by all who long'd to hurt it, but as they cou'd not, detested\r\nthose that hindered them, and by all who do not Care to have great\r\nExamples set them, which they are not fond of following, and lastly by\r\nall who neither love any Thing or any body but themselves, their\r\nInterests or Pleasures, and who had as believe talk of serving Heaven\r\nas their Country. Indeed the common People who come not under these\r\nDistinctions, lov'd me well enough to Drink my Health, especially, when\r\nI gave them the Liquor; and I doubt not wou'd have accompanied me to\r\nthe Gallows, with many a zealous Prayer, if I had been Hanged for\r\nWriting for them. But at the same Time my Character was revil'd and\r\nattack'd with a Number of scandalous Stories, and my Zeal and my\r\nPatriotism exposed to Derision; and I was so far from having any Regard\r\nshewn me by my Governors, that in a Country where Numbers get Pensions\r\nfor nothing, and Places for Services that were never done, I was not\r\nonce offer'd any additional Preferment to my Deanery, and I scorn'd or\r\nrather detested not only to Ask, but even to Wish for it, as I vow'd to\r\nyou before. Most Nations indeed are but too apt to be thankless to\r\ntheir Deliverers, but this above all others, and the _Comperit invidiam\r\nsupremo fine domari_, I found too often verified in myself and my\r\nInterests; and my Character too frequently and too barbarously insulted\r\nwhen Living; and now when I am laid in my Grave, they are grudging\r\ntheir Half-Crowns, to raise me a Monument, that will not last as many\r\nMonths, as I writ Pages for them.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. It is an Happiness, if the World proves ungrateful to the great\r\nand excellent Persons, who serve and adorn the Age that is blest with\r\nthem, that they have a scorn for the Opinions of Men, or even their\r\nLove or their Hatred, their Preferments, or Honours. It is but a poor\r\nSentiment of the illustrious _Xenophon_'s, 'That Praise is sweet to\r\nthose, who are Conscious they deserve it;' for on the contrary, I\r\nbelieve most of those, who truly deserve Praise, have look'd on it as\r\nthe poorest and lowest Reward of well-doing. Great Minds who aim in\r\ntheir best Actions at the Glory of their Maker, and the pleasing that\r\nAuthor of all Good, by labouring to imitate him here below, have\r\nsuperior Views, and do not only look down with a generous Disdain on\r\nthe Applause of others, as it is really trivial and mean, but also as\r\nthey know, they never receive it pure, but dash'd with the Malice of\r\nDetractors, and the Spleen of those little Souls, who Envy them. As\r\nthey are Deaf to their Praise, so great Minds from their natural\r\nSuperiority, bear the Malice of their Enemies with equal Indifference,\r\nand strive to Copy after him whom they serve, by smiling at, and\r\nover-looking the base Ingratitude of those they have done Good to. I am\r\nsensible, _Dean_, as even your Donations will survive both the World\r\nand your own Name, you know from whom to expect your Wages, and when\r\nthey will be paid you; but really when one considers, what wretched\r\nwicked, senseless, Mortals crowd this World, it wou'd make one, out of\r\nCountenance to be actuated merely by a Love to themselves and\r\nDescendants, without any Regard to him, who has commanded us to assist\r\nand befriend them.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I agree with you entirely; I have observed and studied Mankind\r\ntoo long, not to know the _animali Initus & in Cute_, and to look on\r\ntheir Service as perfect Slavery. I have lov'd some odd Men in my Time,\r\nbut the whole Race in a Lump, are a dreadful Carnage of Sins and\r\nInfirmities, Errors and Failings, Reason and Passion, that make a kind\r\nof Twilight in the best Understandings, that is neither Day nor Night,\r\nKnowledge or Ignorance, Vice or Virtue; but a kind of Olio of them all.\r\nEven the highest Characters have their weak-sides, and the most\r\nrefin'd, their Defects and their Failures, with all the Infirmities\r\nwhich Flesh is heir to, and this World where we dwell is apt to taint\r\nMen with. Nay I must tell you in some Verses of mine, which never fell\r\ninto _Faulkner_'s Hands,\r\n\r\n    _Prone to all Ill, the Flesh still warps the Soul,\r\n    Hung like a Byass on the devious Bowl.\r\n    This gives a worldly Cast to all we do,\r\n    Tho' Patriots, Heroes, Saints,----we're Sinners too!\r\n    Tho' some quite faultless in their Lives appear,\r\n    Yet chain'd to this infectious Dungeon here,\r\n    Men small of Earth, like Pris'ners of their Jail,\r\n    And tainted from the Womb, the best are Frail!_\r\n\r\nThis is poor Poetry, _Tom_, but they are honest Thoughts, and such\r\n(Death has taught me that Lesson) are worth all the Wit in the World.\r\nBut I shall quit this Subject, to return to another fear I have for the\r\nProsperity of _Ireland_, and that is the terrible and senseless\r\nFactions, that divide our unfortunate Countrymen. The first great\r\nDivision among them, is their Disputes about spiritual Matters, as\r\nProtestants and Papists. It is not the Danger to the State that alarms\r\nme, for that is quite over; but the Indisposition to Unity and mutual\r\nAffection; by which means the Kingdom is lessen'd in its force and\r\nweight, while we seem to drag like a Man in a Palsy, one half of our\r\nBody after the other, which ought to co-operate with it.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I must add to what you mention, Mr. _Dean_, that it is a\r\nterrible Circumstance, to be surrounded by Catholick Neighbours, who\r\nmany of them think they wou'd do God good Service, if they extirpated\r\nHeresy out of this Island; and therefore till we can get Priests with\r\nbetter Principles, or remove such inhuman Prejudices, by giving their\r\nPeople better Opinions, than that they ought to persecute a Protestant\r\nwith Fire and Sword; we shall ever be a feeble disunited Nation. We to\r\nthis Hour suffer under a loss of Blood and Spirits, from former Wars,\r\nRebellions and Massacres; but as it is probable they will every Day, be\r\nless bigotted, and as their living and conversing so much with the\r\nProtestants, and their going into their ways of Thinking and Living,\r\nhas taken off the Edge of their Animosity; one wou'd hope we shall be\r\nin no Danger from such Accidents hereafter.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I wish and believe it, _Tom_, in Charity; yet still their\r\nReligion, and their superstitious Pilgrimages, Nunneries, Holidays, (as\r\nwe discoursed already) make them lazy and indolent; and their yearly\r\nLents, and weekly Fasts, indispose if they do not disable their\r\nlabouring Poor to Work as much as their Wants require; the spiritual\r\nTaxes which they pay their numerous Clergy, of all Denominations, who\r\nin the Words of the Prophet, 'Eat up the Sins of the People, keep them\r\nvery low, and unable, as well as unwilling to join us in serving the\r\nNation; and their Language and Manners tho' improv'd, yet still\r\ncontinue such a Difference between us and them, as must long keep us\r\ndisjointed, and therefore broken in our Strength as a Community. At\r\npresent we make a shift to live Civily together, but are so far from\r\nbeing closely United, as by Care and Management we might be; that we\r\nseem like some married Couples, to be rather yoak'd together by Law,\r\nthan tied by mutual Affection. But I shall pass over this great Source\r\nof Dissention among us, as much as it hurts us, to take Notice of\r\nanother ill-omen'd Circumstance to our Welfare, and that is the\r\nterrible Parties and Factions among Protestants, which also quite\r\nenervate our Force as a Nation. I remember when I liv'd in _England_,\r\nin the four last stormy Years of Queen _Ann_'s Reign, I made a few\r\nVerses, (tho' I never Printed them for fear of Lord _Bollinbroke_) on\r\nHigh and Low Church, which may be applied to _Ireland_ on this Occasion.\r\n\r\n    _For as two Sawyers in a Pit,\r\n    Toiling a massy Beam to Slit,\r\n    A like their Skill and Prowess show,\r\n    While one draws High and t'other Low.\r\n    So_ WHIG _and_ TORY, BRITAIN _tear\r\n    Asunder, and her Strength impair.\r\n    While Factions all their Arts renew,\r\n    To cut the Nation into Two._\r\n\r\nThis will ever weaken all Governments tho' never so strongly cemented\r\notherwise; but in _Ireland_ it must add Ruin to our natural\r\nInfirmities.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. It is very true, and yet we cherish Factions as if we were to\r\nthrive by them, tho' they prey on the Vitals of our Country, but I\r\nbelieve there is no Nation in _Europe_, that acts so much against her\r\nown Welfare as _Ireland_, or suffers more remarkably by it. The great\r\nMaxim of its being madness to Trust Men's Promises and Engagements, but\r\nthat we are quite safe to Trust their real Interests, seldom holds true\r\nin _Ireland_, for here you may trust Men's Words safely in most Things,\r\nbut they are scarce ever to be depended on, where you wou'd imagine the\r\nInterest of the Kingdom secures them to you. It is strange to consider\r\nthe Violence also with which they Act against each other, for if some\r\nhot People had their Will, they wou'd in their Contests hang up one\r\nthird of the Nation on ill Reports, and then on the least Turn of the\r\nTide, when they cool, they are as ready to String up all their beloved\r\nInformers, as Slanderers; if that general Inclination People have to\r\nlisten to Malice, did not prevail on them to spare them.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. One wou'd imagine where so much Passion is shewn, that they\r\nwrangled for something very Important; but as it is observ'd, that none\r\nare so litigious as the Poor, because they have but little to lose, so\r\nour People keep up the heat of their Parties (which if it cools, like\r\nthat of a Glass-House all Work stops) by every Trifle, by every Word,\r\nby every Doubt, that can give the least Colour for a Difference. In a\r\nhigh Sea and a weak crazy Ship, one wou'd suppose there shou'd be no\r\nDispute in the Crew, but who shou'd stop the Leaks and ply the Pumps\r\nfastest; but we mind every Thing but our safety, which we sacrifice to\r\nour ardour for Noise and Wrangling, and prefer our Resentments to our\r\nLives. If our great Partisans of both Sides, disputed, who shou'd serve\r\ntheir Country most essentially, or who shou'd promote the Tillage or\r\nManufactures of the Kingdom in the best Manner, it wou'd make us the\r\nhappiest of Nations. This wou'd be as noble a Contention of our\r\nDemagogues, as that of the _Horatii_ and _Curiatii_, for the Grandeur\r\nand Glory of _Rome_ and _Alba_, and wou'd end like that in\r\nReconcilement and Peace. If any Thing cou'd calm or unite us, the\r\nsingle Reflection wou'd do it, that if the joint force and weight of\r\nthe Nation, was employ'd in pushing on its true Interests, (whenever\r\nthey came to be debated) nothing cou'd withstand or endanger them. But\r\nwe break our Strength, by crumbling into mean Divisions, petty\r\nInterests and private Views; and while every one's Charity begins at\r\nhome, the Publick is beggar'd and no one relieves it. The general\r\nWelfare is quite over-look'd, while low-minded Wretches are taking Care\r\nof their particular Advantages; and I have ever observ'd that when\r\nPlaces and Pensions and Preferments were settled, the real Business of\r\nthe Nation and its Parties, was thought to be as providentially\r\nadjusted, as that of a Match between two Families, when the Portion and\r\nJointures, and Provisions for younger Children were agreed on. In\r\nshort, _Tom_, the Misery of our Case is, that the good of our Country,\r\nlike the Happiness of another Life, is oftner talk'd of for shew, than\r\npursued in reality.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Indeed _Dean_, I have very long regarded, our Contentions and\r\nParties in this Kingdom, in the same Light you do, and that instead of\r\never keeping in View the great Interests of _Ireland_, Men bawl out\r\ntheir Country! their Country! and mean nothing but themselves,\r\nadvancing their Leaders, and thereby securing proper Emoluments, for\r\nevery little Slave and Hireling that join with them. But what is most\r\nsurprizing is, that while People are so cool to the Publick Interests,\r\nand to Things of the highest Importance; they are furious for Trifles,\r\nand every Imagination, every Guess, every nothing will set their\r\nPassions in a Flame.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I have often lamented that Circumstance, as to this poor Island.\r\nIn truth, _Tom_, our Divisions and Factions here, are frequently as\r\nsilly as those of two Gamesters, who tho' they play for nothing, will\r\nQuarrel dreadfully about cutting and dealing the Cards, and winning the\r\nGame. I am asham'd to say it, but the Contests and brawling of Children\r\nat their Push-pin, are sometimes substantial Things, to the Jangles and\r\nFeuds, I have known our Parties on some Occasions contend about, and\r\nalas! all we get by it, is to give our Enemies Pleasure, and our\r\nFriends Despair, while they see our wretched Country, quite forgot in\r\nthe Squabble, and nothing but Power and Places, private Gain and sordid\r\nInterests attended to. But I will dwell no longer on this melancholy\r\nSubject, which looks so ill for this poor Kingdom, and I will now go to\r\nanother Topick, in which the Conduct of our Countrymen is altogether as\r\nblameable, and is as fatal a Proof of their Coldness to the publick\r\nInterests; and that is their strange Neglect in finishing our Northren\r\nCanal, and completing our Collieries in _Tyrone_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I can never think of the scandalous Mismanagements in both those\r\nAffairs, without Shame and Concern. They are a Disgrace to our Country,\r\neither as to the Honesty or the Skillfulness of the Undertakers, as to\r\ndifferent Parts of the Works relating to the Canal, and also as to the\r\nconducting the Design, and disbursing the Money employed on the\r\nCollieries.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. We are not only the slowest Thinkers of what will do us Good,\r\nbut we are the most slothful also, in bringing such Thoughts into\r\nExecution. The _Newry_ Canal has been carried on, under the Sanction of\r\nan Act of Parliament, and the Superintendance of the Navigation-board\r\nabove twenty Years: And tho' in _Holland_, such a Work wou'd have been\r\nfinish'd in half the Time, and by superior Skill, Oeconomy, and\r\nHonesty, at half the Expence; yet, after laying out immense Sums, there\r\nare still many Thousands wanting to make it a truly finish'd Affair. As\r\nwith much ado we found out, that our own Hills abounded with the\r\nnoblest Coal in the World, and that our Poverty forced us to consider,\r\nthat we paid on an Average about 60000 _l._ a Year for _Whitehaven_\r\nCoal, the Nation at last undertook making the Canal from _Lough Neagh_,\r\nto the Sea, in Hopes they wou'd turn that vast Drain of Money, when we\r\ncou'd stop it, to better Purposes at home. Accordingly great Funds were\r\nassigned it, and an infinite Number of Hands and Heads (or People that\r\nwore Heads) employed on it for a long Space of Time; and yet after vast\r\nSputter, erring and re-erring, correcting and re-correcting, and\r\nexpending near 60000 _l._ the Work is far from being compleated; nor\r\ncan we yet say we are secure of our Canal or our Coal. Much has been\r\npromis'd, and yet by Mismanagements or Misfortunes, and different\r\nObstacles, little has been done to answer the Expectations that were\r\nraised; and tho' we were assured we shou'd in a few Years have at least\r\n20000 Ton of Coals brought every Year to _Dublin_, to help our Poor, we\r\nhave not yet got 500.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I cannot account for the Disappointment, and it well deserves\r\nthe Nation's Enquiry. If, as I heard good Judges say, the Work could\r\nhave been finish'd in five Years Time, what have we lost, who for the\r\nlast fifteen Years, have paid such vast Sums to _Whitehaven_, that we\r\nmight have saved? And how much better had we managed, had we laid out\r\ndouble what it has cost us at the first, and cut short both our Loss\r\nand our Trouble?\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Very true; but instead of this, they have, with true _Irish_\r\nPolicy, contrived to give large Sallaries to some Favourites to carry\r\non the Work, and thus, in Effect, brib'd them to delay the Undertaking\r\nthey were hired to finish. Thus these Plotters against themselves sink\r\nthis noble, generous Design, into a low, miserable Job, and instead of\r\nassisting the Kingdom, they provide for five or six Families, that live\r\ncomfortably on protracting the Execution. If the Colliery Company,\r\nwhose Interest it is to finish the Canal, wou'd undertake the\r\ncompleting it, and fix the Terms with the Navigation-Board, we shou'd\r\nsoon see the Matters well mended; but till that is done, we shall get\r\nnothing but half-work for double Time, and treble Charges.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. The Board will take Care of it; but though they shou'd exert\r\nthemselves ever so warmly, in finishing the Canal, we can never hope\r\nfor the Coal, unless the Nation makes a Waggon-Way of about 5000 Yards\r\nto the River; and as this will cost as many thousand Pounds, we must\r\nwait at least a Summer or two for that, in case the Parliament shou'd\r\ngenerously add this small Sum to all their former Bounties. When I\r\nconsider, that this Kingdom loses so immensely every Year, that we want\r\nour Canal and our Coals, it makes me uneasy to think, we are after so\r\nmany Years disputing about them, when we ought to be enjoying them; but\r\nas the remaining Part of the Expence, to finish this noble Design, is\r\nquite inconsiderable, compared to the Benefit we expect from it; and as\r\nthe Nation must not be trifled with any longer, I hope we shall see it\r\nsoon compleated. For some Years it has had the good Fortune, to be\r\nconducted through many Obstacles, under the Direction of a Prelate[5],\r\nto whose Skill and Zeal, whenever the Canal succeeds, _Ireland_ is\r\ndeeply indebted, and will be forever oblig'd on that Account, to\r\nmention his Name with Honour. This is an encouraging Circumstance, and\r\nthis further Hope of its Success, is left us, that it is now in the\r\nHands of the natural Guardians of our Country, the Parliament; and as\r\nthey well know what a vast Influence cheap or dear Coals have on many\r\nof our Manufactures, they will never let us be much longer deprived of\r\nthis Blessing, which we expect from their Zeal to relieve all the Wants\r\nof _Ireland_.\r\n\r\n      [5] _His Grace of Tuam._\r\n\r\nSWIFT. They need not be told, (though however if I was alive I would\r\ntell them of it) that if it cost us 20000 _l._ more, the Design well\r\ndeserves it; and if it took a much larger Sum, it wou'd be a cheap\r\nPurchase of 60000 _l._ _per Annum_ saved to _Ireland_, which will be\r\nunquestionably the Case in a few Years. After having been such\r\nSpendthrifts so long, it looks like Impudence for us to talk of saving;\r\nbut as Sickness is sometimes the Cause of Health, so Misfortunes and\r\nMisconduct may force us to be happy. It seems impossible, that either\r\nour Canal, or our Collieries, can any longer be delayed or neglected,\r\nand much less left in utter Danger of miscarrying, as I know it was for\r\nsome Time; but I must say, it is a Grief to every Friend of _Ireland_,\r\nand a Satire on our Understandings, as well as our public Spirit, that\r\nwe were so long in discovering such a Leak, and afterwards so tedious\r\nin stopping it up. If we were not a Nation as much made for Plunder, as\r\nsmaller Animals are for Prey, we should long since have remedied this\r\nand many other Evils; but 'tis our peculiar Lot, to starve, like our\r\nold Friend _Tantalus_, with the Meat at our Mouths, to want Bread with\r\nthe richest Fields in _Europe_ under our Feet, and to want Fire with\r\nthe noblest Mountains of Coals before our Eyes.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. To see our Errors is one good Step to remove them; and if once\r\nour Legislature sets vigorously about proper Methods and Remedies for\r\nall our Distresses, there is Hope that their Zeal may make Things take\r\na happier Turn, for this poor Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I wish I may see such a blessed Change in our Affairs, but\r\nSeasons and Aspects are a little unpromising; and what discourages me\r\nthe more is, another dreadful Quality of our People, that of their\r\nbeing so ready to desert and forsake their Country, which they leave as\r\nsillily as Birds quit their Nests, upon every little Fright or\r\nDisturbance, or just to gratify a wandering Humour, and to chuse a\r\nSituation they like better. Our Noblemen and Gentlemen leave us for\r\nPleasure and Amusement, and our Poor for Bread and Wages, which we\r\ncannot or will not provide them at home; and some run off for mere\r\nSafety, as they see our Distresses, and fly from us by the same sort of\r\nInstinct that Rats forsake a falling House. Thus a Family where the\r\nMaster first deserts the Children, and then the Servants follow his\r\nExample, can hardly be reduced to a worse Condition than we are, by\r\nthis epidemical Madness of wandering to _England_. Though the great\r\nGain she makes by their residing there, will never allow her to drive\r\nthem back to us, yet one wou'd expect the very Contempt and Neglect\r\nthey meet with there, wou'd make them return to a Country, where they\r\nwou'd be so much honour'd, and where they well know they are so much\r\nwanted. At the same Time I make no doubt, if the old Statutes, which\r\npunish'd all Absentees with the Forfeiture of their Lands here, were to\r\nbe revived, and they were thereby obliged, to improve the Industry,\r\nArts and Manufactures of our People, _England_ wou'd in Time receive\r\ngreat Advantages by the Change. Mean while they, and all the Earth, see\r\nthe Destruction they bring on us, by their deserting us in so\r\nungenerous a Manner; and tho' the Cause and the Cure are so evident, it\r\navails us no more, than the Knowledge of his Distemper does the poor\r\nWretch that lies a dying. If they stay'd with us, and help'd us, we\r\nshou'd soon recover our natural Strength of Constitution, and become\r\nboth an industrious and an important People; whereas now, we are almost\r\na Cypher in the active and commercial World, and a mere Appendix to\r\nanother Nation; while, like ill-coupled Hounds, by drawing different\r\nWays, we sometimes rather disturb than help one another. If I had Hopes\r\nto get a Law pass'd, to burn every Clergyman who does not reside, to\r\nhang every Gentleman, and behead every Nobleman, who desert their\r\nCountry for their Amusement, I wou'd even be content to return to the\r\nWorld, and sollicit Votes for it; but without taking up the Burden of\r\nLife again, I shou'd feel Joy in my Grave, to have their Estates\r\nsaddled with a constant Tax as a Fine for Absence. How lightly soever\r\nGentlemen regard this Desertion of their native Soil, it is certainly a\r\nCrime no good or great Mind can be capable of: And the Officer who\r\nquits his Quarters, or the Sailor who forsakes his Ship, do not better\r\ndeserve to be mulk'd in their Pay than they do.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I think it a little odd, Mr. _Dean_, that while we see our\r\nCountrymen deserting us so generally, and lament it so loudly, we yet\r\ntake such Measures as if we thought they did not go away fast enough;\r\nand therefore send off our Criminals, to labour, and breed, and enrich\r\n_America_. Tho' this wretched Island is the most improvable, and the\r\nleast improved Part of the habitable Earth, we drive away from us our\r\nFelons, though, if we kept them confin'd to hard Labour, the Kingdom\r\nwou'd receive all the Profit of their Work, and by this Means a\r\nconverted Criminal, like a penitent Sinner, wou'd be of more Use, and a\r\nbetter Man, than if he had never transgressed at all.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. There may be some ill Consequences in that Method of punishing\r\nFelons, as well as some good ones; for in a Complication of Disorders,\r\nsuch as _Ireland_ labours under, what helps the one is pernicious to\r\nthe other. It is our peculiar Misery, that the Desertion of some of our\r\nPeople does not hurt us more, than the Sleepiness, the Inactivity and\r\nHeedlessness of those that stay behind. Many of our common _Irish_ know\r\nas little of the Benefits of useful Labour, as the Savages in the _West\r\nIndies_; and are more inclined to live by Theft and Rapine, than by\r\nusing their Hands and toiling their Bodies. Nay, Crowds of our\r\nGentlemen are as indolent (as we observed on another Occasion) as their\r\nSlaves are lazy; and seem as unwilling to improve their Estates, as if\r\nthey thought their Tenures were as uncertain, and as subject to Change,\r\nas ever their Ancestors found them. At present, there are few Kingdoms\r\nin _Europe_, where the Titles to them are so indisputably settled as\r\nthey are in _Ireland_, and yet they improve more in _France_, where all\r\ndepends on the King's Will, than in _Ireland_, where the Property of\r\nthe Subject is so impregnably secured by the Laws. Of such Force is the\r\nGenius of a Nation in regulating our Manners, and forming our Customs.\r\nI assure you, dear _Tom_, I could name Crowds of our _Irish_ Gentlemen,\r\nthat wou'd double their Estates, if they would live on them, and ditch\r\nthem, and drain them, and build them, and plant them, with half the\r\nSkill and Application of a rich sensible Farmer in _England_; nay, I\r\nknow some of them that are so situated, that they would quadruple their\r\nRents in some Years, if they wou'd build Towns, and set up Manufactures\r\non them with proper Care. There are few of them that have not before\r\ntheir Eyes (if they wou'd open them) Instances of these Things in every\r\nCounty, and yet are no more influenced by it, than if there was no more\r\nEncouragement for Arts or Industry, thinking or working, in this\r\nIsland, than there is in _Borneo_ or _Madagascar_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. There are many Reasons to be assigned, for this great Mistake in\r\nthe Conduct of some of our _Irish_ Gentlemen, Mr. _Dean_, if we wanted\r\nto examine into these Matters; but as to what you was saying, as to\r\ntheir neglecting to live, and plant, and build on their Estates, I have\r\nwondered, since we cannot hope to get a Law to force our Absentees\r\nhome, that we don't make one to oblige all Gentlemen, to build and keep\r\nin Repair one Mansion-house on their Lands, of such and such\r\nDimensions, with proper Offices, suitable to their Incomes. If this\r\ntook in even Freeholders of 20 or 30 _l._ a Year, throughout the\r\nKingdom, it would have a great Effect, and encrease the Number of our\r\nInhabitants, in this deserted Country, as well as the King's Revenue,\r\nby many thousand additional Hearths, and comfortable Places of\r\nResidence. At the same Time, I cannot see one Objection to so useful a\r\nLaw, but that nobody would get by it but the Public, and that many\r\nprivate Gentlemen and Absentees wou'd be forced to be useful to us and\r\ntheir Families whether they wou'd or no, which wou'd probably be\r\nthought a terrible Hardship by some People.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Why, _Tom_, I cannot but say, such a Law wou'd be of great Use\r\nin so naked a Country as this, where one wou'd imagine many of us were\r\ndescended from the Ringleaders in the Building the Tower of _Babel_;\r\nand that by their being then punished, for meddling too much in Stone\r\nand Morter, we have contracted an Aversion to all Building ever since;\r\nbut whenever such a Law is to be pass'd, I could wish they wou'd add\r\nanother to it, that wou'd not only build our Country, but plant it\r\nsurprisingly too.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. And pray what Law is it? For I am ready, like some good Patriots\r\n(who get others to think for them) to vote for it, right or wrong; nay,\r\nbefore I know what it is, since so good a Friend proposes it.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Why, my Act of Parliament is enough to frighten all good\r\nProtestants, and is to impower every Landlord, notwithstanding\r\nSettlements, to set Leases for ever, of ten or twenty Acres, even to\r\nPapists, at the full reserved Rent, who wou'd build good Houses of\r\nStone and Lime, of such and such Dimensions, and inclose and plant an\r\nOrchard and Garden of at least one Acre, and keep them in Repair, on\r\npain of voiding the Tenure. This wou'd, in a few Years, increase the\r\nNumber of our Houses and Orchards prodigiously; and the more as our\r\nNatives are very fond of having Lands and Tenements in their own\r\nCountry, and are willing to give this Pledge of their Allegiance, which\r\nso many of them, for Want of such Ties, sit too loose in. I am sensible\r\nwhat an Outcry, many honest Gentlemen wou'd make to this Law; but I am\r\nsure it wou'd improve our Country to an high Degree; nor do I see what\r\nshou'd hinder us to allow Papists to purchase Lands, (and especially\r\nthe old forfeited Lands) to a limited Value, and without allowing them\r\na Vote, provided they built and inclosed them in proportion to the\r\nEstate: But who can bear to throw away their Thoughts on a Nation, that\r\nmind their own Dreams and Habits of Thinking more than the Reasonings\r\nof others; who cannot be prevailed on to set up new Manufactures, at\r\nthe Instances and Exhortations of a Lord Lieutenant, nay, not at the\r\nAdvice, and, shall I add, even the Entreaties of that illustrious\r\nPatriot and Friend to _Ireland_, my Lord _Ch----d_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. You mean the making Paper here, which that Nobleman, with a Zeal\r\nequal to his Understanding, honoured me with so many Letters about; and\r\ntook so much Pains, with many useful Friends of our Country, to get\r\neffectually established in _Ireland_.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I do; and I want to vent my Spleen, in abusing my Countrymen,\r\nfor the inconsiderable Progress which has been made in so excellent a\r\nDesign. Certainly, though we have made some Advances that Way, if we\r\nhad carried them on with the least Share of that Nobleman's Spirit, we\r\nshou'd have brought it to much greater Perfection than we have done.\r\nEven with what little Care and Encouragement we have bestowed on it, if\r\nwe continue to cultivate it, we may expect in some Years to improve it\r\nso far, as to be able to export large Quantities, and see it swell and\r\nincrease, in proportion to the great Material for it, our Linen. But,\r\nas if we were afraid too many Arts wou'd enrich us too fast, or take up\r\nmore Hands than we cou'd spare; we have given this useful Undertaking\r\nso little Assistance, that it has by no means made the Advances we\r\ncou'd have expected from it; and we have just left it, like a lovely\r\nexotic Flower, to live or die at the Mercy of an unfavourable Season,\r\nand a wintry Climate. This puts our Giddiness, in overlooking every\r\noffered Advantage, and our Supineness as to all Attempts to improve our\r\nCircumstances, in a very indifferent Light; we wear better Linen, and\r\nmore of it, than most of our neighbouring Kingdoms, (our Numbers and\r\nPoverty fairly considered) nay, and we wear them to Rags too, and yet\r\nwe will not save those Rags for the Paper-mill; nor will we, when they\r\nare turned into Paper, buy it, while we can purchase better and dearer\r\nfrom _France_ and _Holland_. In short, we are a People, _Tom_,\r\nmiserable amidst a Crowd of Opportunities to be happy, for Want of a\r\nlittle Activity and Management, a little Sobriety and Care; and one of\r\nthe most alleviating Circumstances of my Death was, my being delivered\r\nfrom the Torment, of endeavouring to serve _Ireland_ to no Purpose.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Indeed, Mr. _Dean_, I cannot but allow there is too much Truth\r\nin many of your Attacks and Abuses of our unfortunate Countrymen; and\r\nyet I am tempted to return to my old Reveries, and to think,\r\nnotwithstanding all their Disadvantages, if I had lived ten Years\r\nlonger in _Ireland_, I shou'd have been able to have made vast\r\nAlterations among them for the better.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. No, _Tom_, not if you had lived longer than _Methuselah_.\r\nConsider, Man, tho' there are Remedies for the Sick, and Helps for the\r\nDying, there are none for the Dead; and in that Light, I have been used\r\nto consider _Ireland_ of a long Time. But prithee, _Tom_, let me know\r\nthe whole of your Scheme; What wou'd you have done?\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why, if you will hear me calmly, Mr. _Dean_, I will give you a\r\nfair Account of what I wou'd have attempted at least, and to open all\r\nmy Heart to you, that was one of the main Subjects I called at your\r\nTomb to talk to you on, to see if we could get any of these Crawlers on\r\nthe Earth to attempt it, by oar artfully suggesting it to him. In\r\nshort, my Project was, by procuring greater and more numerous\r\nSubscriptions, and by extending and enlarging the Plan of the _Dublin_\r\nSociety, to have promoted more than ever the general Good of the\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. You might as well Talk to most People, of the general Good of\r\n_Japan_. I have told you already they have no Notions of such Things:\r\nTheir Thoughts, their Taste, their Passions have another Turn. Did you\r\nexpect to get more from those, who think too much is given already?\r\nWhy, Man, do you forget the Pains, the Application, the Time, and the\r\nExpence, it cost an old Gentleman of our Acquaintance, to procure the\r\nfirst Subscriptions? Recollect also, that after such plain, visible,\r\ngood Effects were seen by the whole Kingdom, what Numbers of those, who\r\nseemed to subscribe with Zeal, withdrew their Subscriptions; and then\r\nconsider what Success you could have of obtaining larger and more\r\nnumerous Contributions.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I am but too sensible, there would be some Difficulty in it, Mr.\r\n_Dean_; but, cold and dead as most Men are, to all great and generous\r\nAttempts to serve us, I know by Experience, that there are yet left in\r\n_Ireland_ a few chosen Spirits, who wou'd have concurr'd in such a\r\nDesign, and who had Hearts and Fortunes suited to the Task, and almost\r\nequal to the Burthen. But happen what would, I am sure, I should have\r\ngot some reasonable additional Subsidies; and though possibly they\r\nwould have been too small to answer my Purpose; yet, still, I should at\r\nleast, have pav'd the Way for some happier Man who would have come\r\nafter me; and I should have the Comfort to think, that my too eager\r\nZeal to serve others, and disserve myself, could not give great\r\nOffence; especially, as Men are not likely to meet Impertinences of\r\nthis Kind, every Day. This I am confident of, that the Use and\r\nAdvantage which that Society, (blessed be God) has been of to\r\n_Ireland_, will secure a large adventitious Fund to her hereafter; and\r\ntho' by the Arts of evil Men, it may be damped, or dropped for some\r\nYears, there never will be wanting, worthy Spirits in the rising\r\nGeneration, who will remember how happily, that Society was set up and\r\nsupported, by a few active Gentlemen; and, that it may be restored\r\nagain, and an adequate Fund provided for it, by the same Resolution and\r\nZeal. But, after all, Mr. _Dean_, I make little Question (if I had\r\nlived, to apply for larger Subscriptions) I should not have been\r\ndisappointed; and, if I had succeeded, _Ireland_ should have had Cause\r\nto remember my good Fortune.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Alas! _Tom_, your Hopes were over-heated, I fear; though there\r\nare many Squanderers, there are few Givers in _Ireland_ and even among\r\nthose few, the greater Part instead of giving their Benefactions while\r\nthey live, and can see them well applied; are laid in their Graves,\r\nbefore their Donations are of use to the Living; for People only bestow\r\ntheir Substance to others, as they do their old Cloathes to their\r\nServants, when they can use them no longer. This, makes me fear, _Tom_,\r\nyou would have got in few Contributions, among our own Countrymen.\r\nAlas! _Tom_, we seem to keep our Repentance for the Time past, and our\r\nCharity for the Future; but the poor present Time, is sacrificed to the\r\nmeanest Avarice, the falsest Pleasures, or, the lowest Ambition;\r\nwithout any Care of the general Welfare of our Country, or one social\r\nWish for the Happiness of our People.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I allow all this would hold true, if the great and admirable\r\nEffects of the Society's Praemiums, did not make it highly probable,\r\nthat I should have prevailed with several of our worthiest Countrymen,\r\nto have assisted so great and so successful an Undertaking. When Men\r\nsee they have it in their Power, if they will join together, to deliver\r\ntheir Country from all its calamitous Distresses; and to be themselves\r\nthe Sources of infinite Blessings to Millions yet unborn, their Hands\r\nrebell against their Hearts, and even Misers learn to be bounteous. I\r\nam not ignorant, how much Men are under the Influence of their lowest\r\nand poorest Passions, yet still I am of Opinion, as Stingy as they\r\ngenerally are, if they evidently saw, where they could do much Good by\r\ntheir Benefactions, we should have more of them in the World than we\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I doubt, _Tom_, you mistake that Matter egregiously, for nine\r\nTenths of our Donations, I fear, proceed more from our Vanity than our\r\nVirtue. Numbers give, as our great Master tells us, to be seen of Men;\r\nand for that Reason, probably, it is, that there are so few secret\r\nCorbans offered up to Heaven, and not to the World; and if this be so,\r\n'tis plain, that People give more for the Ostentation of having given,\r\nthan the good they hope to get done by it, and therefore you must have\r\nmet with few generous Subscribers.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I cannot approve of your Thoughts on this Point, nay, on the\r\ncontrary, I am confident most People give for the heavenly Joy of\r\ngiving, and the seeing much Good likely to be the Consequence of their\r\nBounty; and from the same Way of Thinking, where there is little Hope\r\nof such Consequences, Men give more coldly and illiberally. I will also\r\nadd, that the perceiving, how unskilfully (and therefore\r\nunsuccessfully) many bestow their Alms, is the Death of Charity, and\r\nthe great Obstacle to generous Donations in others. It grieves me to\r\nsay, that I have often observed, that too few give with Judgment.\r\n\r\n    _Perdere multi sciunt, donare pauci._\r\n\r\nAnd Numbers, through an ill concerted generosity, do not half the Good\r\nthey might do, if they appropriated their Gifts with proper Skill, and\r\nknew the happy Art of giving. But giving largely to the _Dublin_\r\nSociety, has not one Objection against it, and answers every End the\r\nhuman Soul can ask for, when it scatters the Dung of the Earth, to\r\nenrich the World. You well know, _Dean_, to give even to an useful\r\nPurpose, which ends with the Occasion that calls for it, falls short of\r\nthose Charities, which extends their Views to future Ages; and\r\ntherefore, to assist Societies, that are contriving for the Welfare of\r\nNations, is a nobler Donation, than relieving private Wants that die\r\naway with the Person relieved. I will go yet further, Mr. _Dean_, since\r\nI have touch'd on this Topick, and assert, that to give, where Virtue\r\nand Industry are the Consequence of the Benefaction, you must allow is\r\nof higher Use, than relieving Distresses, which have been occasioned by\r\nVice or Extravagance, and may probably end in them. Nay, to give under\r\nsuch Conditions, as must inevitably draw in others, to join in your\r\nCharity, and enlarge your Hopes of serving Mankind, is of the greatest\r\nUse; as it brings in Crowds to co-operate with you, and vastly out-do\r\nyour Benefactions; and to give to a Plan of Charity, which is as likely\r\nto encrease as a River, the farther it goes, is of yet greater Service,\r\nthan to give where their Subscription Ends like a Shower of Rain, in\r\nwatering the Earth for a Moment, and vanishes with the next Sun.\r\nLastly, to give to a few, and yet to make Numbers industrious and\r\nlaborious, in Hopes of receiving your Bounty, though they never obtain\r\nit, is of yet more Weight and Importance; and this is plainly the Case\r\nof all Praemiums, where they are faithfully distributed. Now, all these\r\nConsiderations accompany every Subscription to my enlarged Plan, and\r\nthence I was apt to flatter myself I should be successful, if I had\r\nliv'd to apply for them.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Well, I shall drop any Dispute on that Point: But, pray, _Tom_,\r\nbe a little more minute in explaining your Views, and let me know if\r\nyou had many large additional Subscriptions, how would you have applied\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why, I cannot enter into a long Detail of every Particular, but\r\nI would in General, have doubled the Praemiums of most of the Articles,\r\nwhich the Society has yet promoted, and in some of the most important\r\nImprovements and Manufactures, I would have trebled them. By this\r\nMeans, it is hardly credible, what a Progress we should make, in all\r\nthose Subjects of Husbandry and manual Arts in a few Years; and how we\r\nshould work up the Industry and Skill of our People, by every Incentive\r\nthat Profit or Glory could give them. I formerly reckoned up many\r\nArticles which I may probably seem tedious in repeating now, but you\r\nwill make Allowances for my Fondness and Folly, as you know Mr. _Dean_;\r\na Lover would as soon be tired with dwelling on the Praises of his\r\nMistress, as I can be with naming the Things, or the Methods by which I\r\nflattered myself I could have served poor _Ireland_. The reflecting on\r\nthem made my Life pleasant to me when upon Earth, and the Remembrance\r\nof them, sweetens my Grave to me; and therefore, though you may think\r\nthem but Dreams, allow me the Pleasure of repeating them. I say, then,\r\nwith the highest Joy of Heart, that the enlarging and improving our\r\nneglected Tillage, the encouraging and heightening our old decaying\r\nManufactures, and the setting up new ones should have been the great\r\nCare of my Life, and the extending the Force and Use of the Society,\r\nwhen thus advanced to its Manhood, beyond what the Weakness and\r\nInexperience of its infantine State could perform. I would have nursed\r\nup Crowds of Orphan Arts, and as they grew up, and could shift for\r\nthemselves, I would have wean'd them, and brought a new Succession of\r\nothers in their Place, as far as the Narrowness of the Fund would allow\r\nme. I would have brought over foreign Workmen of all Trades and\r\nProfessions; I would have set up Glass Manufactures of all Kinds near\r\nour Collieries; I would have established our Earthen-Ware in the most\r\neffectual Manner, and if possible (by bringing over Hands from\r\n_Birmingham_) I would have improved our Hard-ware to such a Degree of\r\nPerfection as to stop that terrible Drain of our Cash. I had also\r\ndesigned to allow large Encouragements to bring over Foreigners for\r\nimproving our Silk and Thread Bone-lace for enlarging our Paper and\r\nSugar Business, which would be a Saving of many thousand Pounds every\r\nYear to _Ireland_.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Here is a fine Bundle of Hopes for a Man in Despair to live\r\ncomfortably on! But pray now _Tom_, have you done reckoning up all your\r\nmighty Projects to make _Ireland_ another _Utopia_? I am almost at the\r\nEnd of my Patience, for to say Truth, _Tom_, the List of the Ships in\r\n_Homer_'s Iliad is not more tedious.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Why, Mr. _Dean_, to teize you as little as I can, I will drop a\r\nNumber of others, and only touch cursorily on the Advancement of our\r\nSilk Manufactures of every Kind, as well as our Tapestry. I would have\r\nencouraged our Salt-works, and our Ship-building, and I would have set\r\non Foot a Society, to have set up and directed our Fisheries both in\r\nthe North and South Coasts of this Island. If I durst take in smaller\r\nMatters, I would have set up an experimental Farm and Garden, and in\r\nTime allowed a Salary for a Professor in Agriculture, which _Columella_\r\nyou know so much laments the Want of, and I would have given an yearly\r\nPraemium of 100 _l._ for the best annual Invention in Arts and\r\nHusbandry, as much for the best Book yearly in any of the Sciences, and\r\nthe same for the best _English_ Poem; as Nations are apt to judge of\r\neach other's Genius and Talents (I will not say how justly) by the\r\nPerformances they produce this Way. Nay, Mr. _Dean_, I would have\r\nadvis'd a Praemium of at least 100 _l._ annually, to be given by the\r\nSociety for the best Picture, and also, as much for the best Piece of\r\nSculpture, or Statue; as these two Arts have ever been consider'd as\r\nthe chief Marks and Characteristics of a polite and sensible Nation,\r\nand have always flourish'd where ever Arts or Learning have been\r\nencouraged. I had Thoughts of stopping the vast drain of our People to\r\n_America_, by hiring Ships which trade thither, to bring back every\r\n_Irishman gratis_, who disliked the Country, and would rail at it when\r\nhe got Home. Nay, I had even Thoughts of printing a Collection in\r\nFolio, of all the best _Irish_ Pamphlets, or at least, of all the best\r\nHints in them, relating to the Service of our Country. I would have\r\ndone my utmost to have gotten the best and noblest Members of the\r\nSociety (as great and good Men communicate Virtue to their Friends as\r\nthe Loadstone invigorates the Needle it touches) to have petitioned the\r\nParliament for sumptuary Laws, for Hospitals in every County Town, for\r\nestablishing a national Bank, for illuminating our Coasts, with\r\nLight-houses as carefully as our Streets with Lamps; for applying to\r\nhis Majesty for a Mint for our Copper and Silver Coinage, and also for\r\nhardening it to prevent its wearing; as well as for forming Canals for\r\nassisting our inland Navigation, and for working up our Collieries, and\r\nopening those hidden Treasures our Mines. I would have promoted by\r\njudicious Praemiums.----\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Hold! Stop! Where is the Man going? Are you sailing in Quest of\r\nthe North-West Passage to make a short Cut to Wealth and Trade of your\r\nown imagining? You boddered me enough with many of these Articles\r\nalready, and do you expect I can be as little tired with them as you\r\nare? Whenever you enter upon this Subject, you run on, Head foremost,\r\nlike a mad Hound on the Road, without minding what's before you; weak\r\nMen, I find, tho' they cannot Think without Talking, can Talk without\r\nThinking. Was there ever such a Hodge-Podge of Reveries, mustered up by\r\na living Author, to say nothing of a dead one, that should have a\r\nlittle more Sense? Why there is not in all _Bedlam_, a Man so absurdly\r\ndistracted by an Over-load of Projects. You are a sweet Politician\r\nindeed, _Tom_, and just as fit to conquer Nations as to mend them. What\r\nenthusiastical Delusions stuff thy Noddle? Will you never remember\r\n_mundus vult vadere quo vult_ and be satisfied to leave the World to\r\nhim that made it, and Kingdoms to those he has appointed to govern\r\nthem? These high flown Whims of yours, are just as practicable, as\r\n_Archimedes_ his moving the Earth out of its Place, and it provokes me\r\nto hear such impossible Projects declaim'd on by such a Visionary, such\r\na Stockjobber in Politicks!\r\n\r\nPRIOR. You try my Temper too far, I neither can nor will bear your\r\ninsolent contemptuous Way of conversing, or your opprobrious provoking\r\nLanguage. If you attack my favourite Foible with such Acrimony, you\r\nmust expect I will not spare some of yours: As for your sneering at my\r\nPoliticks, I own I never was a Politician, nor did I ever set up for\r\none. I had too rational an Head, I thank Heaven, and too honest an\r\nHeart, to allow me to make any great Progress that Way. And now, Mr.\r\n_Dean_, I must tell you very frankly, I never saw or heard any eminent\r\nProofs of your extraordinary Skill as a Politician, except a vast Crowd\r\nof Pamphlets; And what are they but the mere Cobwebs of Politicks, that\r\nowe their Birth to the House being neglected, and are all swept away\r\nwhen it is clean'd? You was a pretty good Patriot, but you had so much\r\nof the Politician, the next to taking Care of others, you loved to take\r\nCare of yourself, and all possible Care too. You kept a good Byass on\r\nyour Bowl to get near the Jack at long run and secure a Mitre; and tho'\r\nwhen you were disappointed, you furiously attack'd the Ministry and\r\npleaded your Country's Cause with due Resentment; yet even then, your\r\nRevenge when over-tired, slept like an Hare with its Eyes open, that\r\nwhile you watch'd for the publick Good, you should not overlook your\r\nown. Besides, let me tell you _Dean_, if you will be taunting, that if\r\nthe political Secrets of the latter End of the Queen's Reign were\r\ndetected, you would be found as rank a Jacobite as many Authors in\r\nthose Days represented you to the World.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I think you have borrowed some of their sort of Spite, for you\r\nseem to be in a great Fury with little Reason for it. But I must tell\r\nyou, Sir, though those Authors were ever mistaken when they called me a\r\n_Jacobite_, I never was in the wrong when I called them Fools. As for\r\nyour political Secrets, let me be allowed to set you right, for I\r\nassure you there are no such Things in _England_. Men are such sievish\r\nleaky Mortals there, that they can't conceal even their own Rogueries;\r\nfor political Secrets told to _Britons_, tho' under Vows of Secrecy,\r\nare like Bonds for great Sums seal'd in private, but Judgment is soon\r\nenter'd up in the public Offices; and all the World knows in a trice\r\nwhat has pass'd. As for the kind Hints those Writers Honoured me with,\r\nI assure you, Sir, I despised them as sincerely as your Anger now.\r\nTheir Talents were incapable of hurting any but themselves, and\r\ntherefore I forgave them, as the Law pardons Children and Ideots. It is\r\ntrue, where their Spite appeared very invenom'd, I took other Measures;\r\nfor then, as the Statute speaks of Boys, _Malitia suplet aetatem_\r\n(Malice supplies their Want of Age) and I pepper'd them off\r\nnotwithstanding their Folly, to frighten silly Scribblers from playing\r\nwith such edg'd Tools again. But after all, what were their Works\r\nagainst me, but a mere hot Hash of cold Meat, of fifty half read\r\npolitical Authors, and unknown common-place Party-Writers, mix'd up\r\nwith common Reports, and a few insipid lifeless Scraps of their own\r\ntasteless Trash and factious Venom.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. We that are dead and love Truth, know that most Books, and\r\nespecially Party Books are made like their Paper of old Scraps and Rags\r\npickt up here and there; but however, their Works in those Days pleased\r\nthe World, had an infinite number of Applauders, and made you\r\nsufficiently jealous of the Talents of their Authors.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I jealous! I detest, I renounce the Thought! I was never jealous\r\nof any Man but my self, lest I should fall short of that Glory, which I\r\nknew I had gained, and feared I might lose again. I ever judg'd when a\r\nMan has wrote a good Book, he should Stop as _Jupiter_ did when he\r\nbegot _Hercules_, left his next Production, should be found vastly\r\nbeneath the former; and therefore I was as suspicious of my scribling\r\nTemper, as Physicians say an over-fed Glutton should be of his Finger's\r\nEnds. But I scorn'd my Antagonists too much, to be jealous of them, or\r\neven to be Angry with them; for tho' they abused me very Generally and\r\nvery Grosly, my chief Delight was, that they never reviled me so much\r\nas when I was in my greatest Glory, as Dogs never are so apt to Bark at\r\nthe Moon, as when she is at the Full. Besides, let me tell you, testy\r\nSir, with the old Poet _Nomina mille, mille nocendi Artes_. 'Tis so\r\neasy to be malicious, and at the same time so mean, that true Worth\r\nnever Triumphs so eminently over its Enemies, as when they expose their\r\nWeakness and Envy by reviling it. It is true, many Scriblers busied\r\nthemselves with Criticising and Decrying my Works; but they were so far\r\nfrom disturbing me, I made the best Use of them, by improving my\r\nProductions; for Criticks to good Writers, are like their own Dust to\r\nDiamonds, good for nothing but just to polish them, and them only. I\r\nJealous! No really, Sir, there was no Occasion for it; the very Wit of\r\nmy Writings kept all the laughing Part of Mankind on my Side, and I\r\nnever lived in any Times where reasoning was much regarded by the\r\ncommon Herd of Readers or Talkers.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. A pretty Confession for an Author, Truly! and yet since you have\r\nstirred my Gall, I must tell you, that we may say of the brightest of\r\nyour Writings, what I said in one of my Exercises at School of Mr.\r\n_Cowlry_.\r\n\r\n    _With all the Graces, all the Faults of Wit,\r\n    You both adorn'd and blemisht all you writ._\r\n\r\nI am sure you had often such a quick running hand way of thinking, that\r\nyou frequently left your meaning behind you. But I am not angry enough\r\nto make any severe Remarks of my own, on the numerous Tracts you gave\r\nthe World; but there was one Objection every one agreed in, and that\r\nwas your banishing Divinity out of all your Compositions, and indeed\r\nout of your Conversation; so that it should seem Mr. _Dean_, if I am\r\nsuch a wretched Politician as you say, I may as fairly and more truly\r\ntell you, that you have not shewn your self a very able Divine.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I smile at the Weakness of the Objection, but I am quite\r\ndelighted with the Malice of it. Let me tell you, Sir, I had something\r\nelse to do with my Divinity, than filling Pamphlets with it to make\r\nmadmen Merry, and wisemen Sick. There is a Decency, or shall I rather\r\nsay a Chastity in Writing or Thinking on such exalted Subjects, that\r\ngreat Minds are apt to Cherish, which keeps them Cautious and\r\nDiffident, where weak Men are as bold and as rash (to use an homely\r\nPhrase) as a blind Mare in a Mire. I have known many silly Preachers,\r\nand paperscull'd Writers in my Time, that were troubled with the\r\nDivinity Squirt, and were forc'd to print, or to be tormented with the\r\nCholick, or foul themselves; and so they exposed their Nakedness to the\r\nWorld, with all their Rhapsodies of dreaming Thoughts, borrowed Sense,\r\nand hearsay Learning. I was none of those High Dutch Inkshiters as\r\nsomebody calls them; and instead of sending my Religion to the Press to\r\nmake other Men frantick, I kept mine at home to keep my self Sober. As\r\nto the rest of your Objection, Sir, I must confess I did not talk much\r\nof Divinity, nor did I love to hear others bring it into Conversation;\r\nfor it was always my Opinion, that tho' Divinity and Piety are at home\r\nin the Church and the Closet, yet every where else they are used as\r\nStrangers, and should be treated with the highest Respect and Ceremony.\r\nThe Practice Men have fallen into, of over-writing and over-talking\r\nthemselves on such Subjects, has done and is doing such harm in the\r\nWorld, that I wonder it has not been hist out of it; but there are some\r\nPersons so fond of haranguing, declaiming and setting out their Noise\r\nto the Crowd, that if they wrote on Geometry or Algebra, they would\r\nflourish and use Tropes and Figures to shew their Parts and their\r\nEloquence, and so in spite of all Advice and Experience, Divinity and\r\nReligion must be bother'd out of their Senses by Praters and Scriblers\r\nand half Thinkers.\r\n\r\nBut prithee _Tom_, let my Divinity alone. Why should you strive to vex\r\nme by throwing Dirt at me now, tho' you know I was never disturbed by\r\nsuch impotent Petulance, when I was above Ground; or else I had\r\nRevilers enough to make me as Sick of _Ireland_, after all the Service\r\nI had done it by my Pen, as ever King _William_ was of _England_, after\r\nhe had delivered it by his Sword. But let us put an End to this ugly\r\nBrawl, which even the Passion and Impudence of the living might blush\r\nat. It is a shame _Tom_, for old Friends to Quarrel for such miserable\r\nTrifles, and for the dead to grow so angry at them; puts us in as bad a\r\nLight, as the half-witted Fools that are still crawling on the Earth.\r\nPrithee be calm and cool as the Grave ought to make you, and let us\r\nagree to drop this fit of ill Humour, and I shall make you a Proposal\r\nthat I hope will give you the highest Pleasure. If you will lay aside\r\nyour Resentment for my abusing your Schemes, I will offer you one, that\r\nif ever it comes to be embraced, will make _Ireland_ one of the\r\nfortunate Islands.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Make me Master of that important Secret, and convince me of its\r\nbeing probable and practicable, and my anger is over in an Instant,\r\nlike an Infant's. Dear _Dean_, you rejoyce my Heart with the very hint\r\nyou have dropt, and let me beg of you to communicate the whole to me.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Why my Scheme is entirely bottom'd on that happy one of your\r\nSociety's Premiums but so completely secur'd from my old Objection of\r\nthe narrowness and uncertainty of its Fund, as to make the force of the\r\nEngine quite equal to the Work 'tis designed for. No one can have an\r\nhigher Opinion than I of the salutary Effects, which publick and\r\nhonorary Rewards have on the human Mind; and above all, when the\r\nSociety's Fund does not depend on Charities given by Scraps and casual\r\nHelps quite inadequate to her extended Views, but on the publick Faith,\r\nand the great Source of all our Supplies the national Bounty, and the\r\nZeal, the Generosity, the good Sense of our _Irish_ Representatives. It\r\nis as shameful to see a Kingdom depending on private Contributions, as\r\na _Ballysarius_ begging of a common Soldier. The King thought so when\r\nhe extended his royal Munificence to us, and tho' he cannot help all,\r\nor do all; he has shewn us he desires it, and would gladly spur us on\r\nto Exert ourselves, and be more generally Active and Busy. This\r\nillustrious Example makes me confident, that if in imitation of his\r\nMajesty, the Parliament should resolve to assist us; it would be the\r\nnoblest and quickest Method of relieving all our Wants, and banishing\r\nIndolence and Misery for ever from _Ireland_.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I embrace the lucky Thought, and hope if it be followed, it may\r\nbe for ever Propitious to this poor Kingdom. I remember he that first\r\nintroduced that obvious, but happy Scheme of Premiums; used often to\r\ndeclare that the Method of Private Subscriptions was but a mere\r\ntransitory Shift to set up with, and give a Proof of what Effects they\r\nwould produce; but that Parliamentary Aids were the only adequate Funds\r\nwe could thrive by. I often used to tell him my Fears, that such\r\nAssistances were not to be hoped for, and I own I have some Doubt, that\r\nthere are some Objections against such extraordinary Helps now.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I know them as well as you, _Tom_, but there are none take my\r\nWord for it, but what are surmountable by the Spirit and Honour of an\r\n_Irish_ Parliament. I dare pawn all that is dear to me among Men, that\r\nif our Senators will Vote 4000 _l._ _per Ann._ to the Society, that is\r\n1000 _l._ to each of the Provinces, to encourage Tillage, enliven every\r\nArt and Manufacture, promote every Good, and remove every Evil among\r\nus; we should before the End of this Century, be as much the Envy of\r\nour Neighbouring Nations, as we are now their Contempt. As they would\r\ninspect over the Distribution of all they gave, there can be no fear of\r\nMisapplication, or the low Tricks of Jobbing; and as a Tax either on\r\nDeals or Wines, on Paper or Stampt-paper, News-papers, or Almanacks; on\r\nPlays, Musick-Meetings, Assemblies, on Lands sold, on Swords or Jewels\r\nworn on our Crowds of useless Servants or thoughtless Travellers, would\r\nmost of them furnish us with sufficient Funds. I can see nothing to\r\nprevent so blessed a Purpose. I remember an illustrious Friend of ours\r\nused to say, it would be no bad Way, if in all future Parliaments,\r\nevery Member should be obliged to add to the present Oaths he takes,\r\none plain one, that he would do his utmost to promote the Manufactures\r\nof this Country, the Industry of the People, and to secure Bread and\r\nFire at Home to the miserable Poor. But if the present Parliament\r\nshould give a Vote of Credit for 4000 _l._ a Year to the Society, it\r\nwould make such an Oath quite unnecessary, and they would enable them\r\nby that single Measure to give all our Affairs a new Face, and put us\r\nat once in the happiest Situation that Activity and Affluence could\r\nprocure us.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I have such a Confidence in the Concurrence of Men of all\r\nParties in so glorious a Design, that I begin to look already on this\r\nAffair as certain and settled. There are such Crowds of sincere and\r\nhearty Friends to their Country in that honourable Assembly, that I\r\nfully persuade my self, they will never grudge so small a Sum to this\r\nplain and evident Method of laying the Foundation on which the\r\nProsperity of _Ireland_ may stand for ever. We should then see\r\nprodigious Changes for the better, and no more hear such complaining in\r\nour Streets of no Trade, no Arts or Artists, or Encouragement for them\r\nin _Ireland_. This depends on ourselves and the Spirit and Votes of our\r\nown generous Commons, who will be bless'd by Posterity for thus making\r\ntheir Zeal, the great Source of Wealth, Industry, Plenty and Peace\r\namongst us. Indeed, when I consider how shameful it wou'd be, if,\r\nthrough any undue Influence we should want every Support in our Power\r\nto give our People to enliven, enrich, or distinguish our Country; I\r\ngrow almost Confident of such a blessed Assistance. This is helping our\r\nFamilies, our Dependants, our Tenants and Fellow-Citizens, the present\r\nand future Generations. Every Acre the Society would by this means\r\nimprove (and they would improve Millions) would be so much additional\r\nWealth to the Kingdom; every Art they set up; every manual Trade they\r\nencourage, will be a new strength to us, and will spread themselves as\r\nfast thro' the Kingdom as our Rivers do their vital Juices thro' our\r\nPlains.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Well, _Tom_, I am glad our Disputes are at an End, that I have\r\npleased you at last, and made you entirely prefer my Methods of\r\nassisting the Society to your own. It is certain, a Vote of Parliament\r\nhas often set up useful Manufactures here, and this will be but a\r\ngeneral one, for the setting up all. Nor is there any Cause to doubt of\r\nthis publick Bounty, for tho' private Men are penurious, Nations are\r\ngenerous, and the publick Money is so easily raised, is paid by so\r\nmany, and hurts so few, that even a Parliament of Misers might be\r\nCharitable. Every body is well disposed to bestow bounteously out of\r\nhis Neighbour's Purse, to good Purposes, tho' he may be close enough or\r\ncautious enough, to save his own; and at the same Time, the Publick is\r\ncertainly the proper and natural Guardian of its own Wants and\r\nInterests. In short, _Tom_, the Thing is so manifest and self-evident,\r\nthat I dare pronounce the Day is coming, when Votes to set on foot such\r\nUndertakings, proposed by skilful Artists, and to encourage publick\r\nWorks, will be as common as Addresses to the King, and Congratulations\r\nto our Lord Lieutenants. As we ought to give to _Ireland_, and to help\r\nour poor Country as well as his Majesty; and as no Money given by any\r\nPeople, can be productive, of so much and so general a Good to all, as\r\nthis 4000 _l._ _per Ann._; as it will be manag'd by such clean Hands,\r\nand such clear Heads and faithful Hearts, as it will be directed by an\r\nIndustry that never slackens, and by a Society which by the King's\r\nGoodness to us, can never die, I am sure we shall not be denied it.\r\nThis is really the truest and noblest Use of Riches, for to give and\r\nrelieve Thousands, is the best View on which we can either gather or\r\ndisperse them, and above all when the Charity begins at home, and helps\r\nand makes happy our wanting Brethren. This Design must give the highest\r\nJoy to the Parliament, which supports and enforces it, for it is\r\ncertainly a vast Pleasure to a Patriot any way to assist in alleviating\r\nand assisting the Wants of his indigent Countrymen; but how much must\r\nhis Joy be encreas'd, and what must he feel, who bestows Knowledge,\r\nVirtue and Industry, to Millions of his Fellow-Citizens? To give to\r\nsuch noble Ends, seems to be transcending the Limits of Humanity, and\r\nwou'd look like usurping on the Power of Heaven, if the Creator had not\r\ntransform'd it, to a Kind of Homage to himself.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. Dear _Dean_, I forgive you any Trifle that offended me in our\r\nDialogue, and I thank you from my Soul for this happy Expedient to\r\nserve our Country so evidently and effectually. If once our\r\nRepresentatives will let us feel and know, that Industry in _Ireland_,\r\nshall never be unrewarded, nor Arts neglected, we shall soon learn that\r\nin so fertile a Country, no Man who has Hands and will use them, can\r\never want either the Necessaries or Conveniences of Life. This Help\r\nfrom our Parliament wou'd turn in a little Time our Desarts into\r\nGardens, our Famines into Plenty, our Herdsmen into Farmers, our\r\nBeggars into Labourers, our Villages of starving Cottagers, into Towns\r\nswarming with Artists, and our Beasts into Men; nay every Hill wou'd be\r\ncultivated, every Valley ornamented, and our Lands as much improv'd as\r\nour Roads.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. What hindered our former Parliaments from taking such Measures,\r\nI will not pretend to Guess, but why they in the Days of our Ancestors,\r\nshou'd Vote such Funds to our Civil and Military Establishments, and\r\nsuch Pittances, such Nothings, to the Ease, the Well-being, the\r\nHappiness and Honour of the Nation, is hard to say, and parhaps, _Tom_,\r\nif we were living in those Days not very safe. It is a Comfort our\r\nPeople are in no such Danger now, under such a Senate and such a\r\nGovernor, nor shall we be any more in danger of Jobbing away our\r\nCountry for private Views, or sacrificing the general Welfare of a\r\nwhole People to the Pride or the Power, the Gain, Avarice or Ambition,\r\nof half a Dozen over-grown Men. But there is one Thing, _Tom_, I must\r\nmention, as almost as usefull to the Happiness of _Ireland_, as the\r\nParliament's Assistance, and that is that in every County, great City,\r\nand large manufacturing Towns, Societies shou'd be form'd with\r\nSubscriptions from all who compose them, for setting up Premiums for\r\nsuch Improvements, in all the manual Arts, as they find they want most\r\nto set forward. But as I think you mention'd this already, and seem as\r\nzealous to see it promoted as I am, I shall not enlarge on it as fully\r\nas it deserves. All I shall hint at is, that 50 _l._ or 60 _l._ or at\r\nmost 100 _l._ a Year thus applied, wou'd have amazing Effects thro' the\r\nNation, as it wou'd remove all those Wants, and set up those Arts,\r\nwhich wou'd most affect their particular Circumstances, and which the\r\n_Dublin_ Society, cou'd not so immediately attend to, in its general\r\nView of assisting all. As soon as the most necessary Things were fully\r\nprovided for, such Societies wou'd go on to others, and thus in Time,\r\nwou'd find their own Estates and Neighbourhoods, largely repaying by\r\ntheir Improvements, the Care and the Expence of the Subscribers. The\r\nmaritime Counties, wou'd soon among other Things set up Fisheries, and\r\nthe Inland Counties, wou'd promote either Tillage or Mines, or usefull\r\nManufactures; and by this means, all the great Drains of our Health and\r\nour Wealth, our Blood and our Spirits, wou'd be cut off, and our\r\nnatural Strength wou'd encrease with our Labour. Thus in Process of\r\nTime, this Kingdom wou'd be the Happiest, instead of being the most\r\nDistrest of all Lands, and wou'd be as Rich as she wants to be,\r\nprovided always, dear _Tom_, that like some good-natur'd thriving\r\nMerchants I have known, we do not resolve to be bound for our elder\r\nBrother's Debts.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. I think such Societies in every County, or every considerable\r\nCounty, wou'd be a nobel Addition to our Parliamentary Bounties; and I\r\ntrust in the Providence of him who governs the World, and the Goodness\r\nof those whom he has appointed as his Substitutes over these Nations,\r\nwe shall not want these Blessings long. But we will if you please, Mr.\r\n_Dean_, drop this Subject at the present; and now we have talk'd over\r\nso many of these Particulars relating to the Welfare of _Ireland_, I\r\nwou'd fain speak on other interesting Topicks, which also occasion'd my\r\npaying this Visit to you. The first is to canvass over calmly and\r\ncandidly all the Arguments for or against a Union of this Kingdom, with\r\n_Great Britain_. I am assured by all the Ghosts I have met with of\r\nlate, that this is a Design, which in due Time is surely to be brought\r\nabout one way or other. The second is the violent and ill-judg'd\r\nBrigues and Feuds, between some of our most considerable People; who\r\ntear our Country in Pieces, like _Caesar_ and _Pompey_, because one\r\ncannot bear an Equal, nor the other a Superior, in the Government. In\r\nthe 3d Place, I want to settle clearly, whether any of the Money that\r\nwas charged to the Account of our Barracks, was carried out of the\r\nKingdom by some strange Accident or other. When we have fully discussed\r\nthis, I wou'd in the last place talk to you, in as free a Manner, as\r\ntwo such Friends to _Ireland_ shou'd do; how well our Senate has\r\nformerly maintained, and is likely now to maintain its undoubted Right\r\nof disposing of the Redundancies of the Treasury, and taking Care that\r\nthe People's Money, be laid out for the Service of themselves and the\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nSWIFT. I am quite pleased with your Proposal; but stay, I see they are\r\nlighting up Candles for Morning Service. Ah, _Tom_, if the Prayers of\r\nthe Living were as Sincere and as Ardent as those of the Dead, what an\r\naltered World wou'd this be? Here is the Curate and three old Women\r\ncoming to Church; what think you if for fear of frighting Fools, we\r\nlaid by these winding Sheets in my Tomb, and walk'd in _Fresco_, in the\r\nDeanery-Garden, and enjoy'd this bright Morn.\r\n\r\nPRIOR. With all my Heart. I have a Budget of Anecdotes, and a deal of\r\nLaw and Politicks, to entertain you with. Oh this poor Kingdom! this\r\nunthinking People grieve my Soul!\r\n\r\nSWIFT. Dear _Tom_, most Men scarce begin to Think, till they're\r\nsummoned to die, and that I fear must be the Case of _Ireland_, unless\r\nthe Parliament helps us. _Allons!_ to my old dear Garden----lead the\r\nWay! without _sans_ Ceremony, as _Jodolet_ says in the play.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EXEUNT._",
