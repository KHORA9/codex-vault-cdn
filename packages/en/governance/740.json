Calhoun,\r\n  \"On Nullification and the Force Bill.\"\r\n  U.S. Senate,\r\n  15 February 1833\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President:\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress, it was avowed on all sides that the\r\npublic debt, as to all practical purposes, was in fact paid, the small\r\nsurplus remaining being nearly covered by the money in the Treasury and\r\nthe bonds for duties which had already accrued; but with the arrival of\r\nthis event our last hope was doomed to be disappointed.  After a long\r\nsession of many months, and the most earnest effort on the part of\r\nSouth Carolina and the other Southern States to obtain relief, all that\r\ncould be effected was a small reduction of such a character that, while\r\nit diminished the amount of burden, it distributed that burden more\r\nunequally than even the obnoxious Act of 1828; reversing the principle\r\nadopted by the Bill of 1816, of laying higher duties on the unprotected\r\nthan the protected articles, by repealing almost entirely the duties\r\nlaid upon the former, and imposing the burden almost entirely on the\r\nlatter.  It was thus that, instead of relief--instead of an equal\r\ndistribution of burdens and benefits of the government, on the payment\r\nof the debt, as had been fondly anticipated--the duties were so\r\narranged as to be, in fact, bounties on one side and taxation on the\r\nother; thus placing the two great sections of the country in direct\r\nconflict in reference to its fiscal action, and thereby letting in that\r\nflood of political corruption which threatens to sweep away our\r\nConstitution and our liberty.\r\n\r\nThis unequal and unjust arrangement was pronounced, both by the\r\nadministration, through its proper organ, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and by the opposition, to be a *permanent* adjustment; and it\r\nwas thus that all hope of relief through the action of the general\r\ngovernment terminated; and the crisis so long apprehended at length\r\narrived, at which the State was compelled to choose between absolute\r\nacquiescence in a ruinous system of oppression, or a resort to her\r\nreserved powers--powers of which she alone was the rightful judge, and\r\nwhich only, in this momentous juncture, could save her.  She determined\r\non the latter.\r\n\r\nThe consent of two-thirds of her Legislature was necessary for the call\r\nof a convention, which was considered the only legitimate organ through\r\nwhich the people, in their sovereignty, could speak.  After an arduous\r\nstruggle the States-rights party succeeded; more than two-thirds of\r\nboth branches of the Legislature favorable to a convention were\r\nelected; a convention was called--the ordinance adopted.  The\r\nconvention was succeeded by a meeting of the Legislature, when the laws\r\nto carry the ordinance into execution were enacted--all of which have\r\nbeen communicated by the President, have been referred to the Committee\r\non the Judiciary, and this bill is the result of their labor.\r\n\r\nHaving now corrected some of the prominent misrepresentations as to the\r\nnature of this controversy, and given a rapid sketch of the movement of\r\nthe State in reference to it, I will next proceed to notice some\r\nobjections connected with the ordinance and the proceedings under it.\r\n\r\nThe first and most prominent of these is directed against what is\r\ncalled the test oath, which an effort has been made to render odious.\r\nSo far from deserving the denunciation that has been levelled against\r\nit, I view this provision of the ordinance as but the natural result of\r\nthe doctrines entertained by the State, and the position which she\r\noccupies.  The people of Carolina believe that the Union is a union of\r\nStates, and not of individuals; that it was formed by the States, and\r\nthat the citizens of the several States were bound to it through the\r\nacts of their several States; that each State ratified the Constitution\r\nfor itself, and that it was only by such ratification of a State that\r\nany obligation was imposed upon its citizens.  Thus believing, it is\r\nthe opinion of the people of Carolina that it belongs to the State\r\nwhich has imposed the obligation to declare, in the last resort, the\r\nextent of this obligation, as far as her citizens are concerned; and\r\nthis upon the plain principles which exist in all analogous cases of\r\ncompact between sovereign bodies.  On this principle the people of the\r\nState, acting in their sovereign capacity in convention, precisely as\r\nthey did in the adoption of their own and the Federal Constitution,\r\nhave declared, by the ordinance, that the acts of Congress which\r\nimposed duties under the authority to lay imposts, were acts not for\r\nrevenue, as intended by the Constitution, but for protection, and\r\ntherefore null and void.  The ordinance thus enacted by the people of\r\nthe State themselves, acting as a sovereign community, is as obligatory\r\non the citizens of the State as any portion of the Constitution.  In\r\nprescribing, then, the oath to obey the ordinance, no more was done\r\nthan to prescribe an oath to obey the Constitution.  It is, in fact,\r\nbut a particular oath of allegiance, and in every respect similar to\r\nthat which is prescribed, under the Constitution of the United States,\r\nto be administered to all the officers of the State and Federal\r\ngovernments; and is no more deserving the harsh and bitter epithets\r\nwhich have been heaped upon it than that or any similar oath.  It ought\r\nto be borne in mind that, according to the opinion which prevails in\r\nCarolina, the right of resistance to the unconstitutional acts of\r\nCongress belongs to the State, and not to her individual citizens; and\r\nthat, though the latter may, in a mere question of *meum* and *tuum,*\r\nresist through the courts an unconstitutional encroachment upon their\r\nrights, yet the final stand against usurpation rests not with them, but\r\nwith the State of which they are members; and such act of resistance by\r\na State binds the conscience and allegiance of the citizen.  But there\r\nappears to be a general misapprehension as to the extent to which the\r\nState has acted under this part of the ordinance.  Instead of sweeping\r\nevery officer by a general proscription of the minority, as has been\r\nrepresented in debate, as far as my knowledge extends, not a single\r\nindividual has been removed.  The State has, in fact, acted with the\r\ngreatest tenderness, all circumstances considered, toward citizens who\r\ndiffered from the majority; and, in that spirit, has directed the oath\r\nto be administered only in the case of some official act directed to be\r\nperformed in which obedience to the ordinance is involved....\r\n\r\nIt is next objected that the enforcing acts have legislated the United\r\nStates out of South Carolina.  I have already replied to this objection\r\non another occasion, and will now but repeat what I then said: that\r\nthey have been legislated out only to the extent that they had no right\r\nto enter.  The Constitution has admitted the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates within the limits of the several States only so far as the\r\ndelegated powers authorize; beyond that they are intruders, and may\r\nrightfully be expelled; and that they have been efficiently expelled by\r\nthe legislation of the State through her civil process, as has been\r\nacknowledged on all sides in the debate, is only a confirmation of the\r\ntruth of the doctrine for which the majority in Carolina have contended.\r\n\r\nThe very point at issue between the two parties there is, whether\r\nnullification is a peaceful and an efficient remedy against an\r\nunconstitutional act of the general government, and may be asserted, as\r\nsuch, through the State tribunals.  Both parties agree that the acts\r\nagainst which it is directed are unconstitutional and oppressive.  The\r\ncontroversy is only as to the means by which our citizens may be\r\nprotected against the acknowledged encroachments on their rights.  This\r\nbeing the point at issue between the parties, and the very object of\r\nthe majority being an efficient protection of the citizens through the\r\nState tribunals, the measures adopted to enforce the ordinance, of\r\ncourse, received the most decisive character.   We were not children,\r\nto act by halves.  Yet for acting thus efficiently the State is\r\ndenounced, and this bill reported, to overrule, by military force, the\r\ncivil tribunal and civil process of the State!  Sir, I consider this\r\nbill, and the arguments which have been urged on this floor in its\r\nsupport, as the most triumphant acknowledgment that nullification is\r\npeaceful and efficient, and so deeply intrenched in the principles of\r\nour system, that it cannot be assailed but by prostrating the\r\nConstitution, and substituting the supremacy of military force in lieu\r\nof the supremacy of the laws.  In fact, the advocates of this bill\r\nrefute their own argument.  They tell us that the ordinance is\r\nunconstitutional; that it infracts the Constitution of South Carolina,\r\nalthough, to me, the objection appears absurd, as it was adopted by the\r\nvery authority which adopted the Constitution itself.  They also tell\r\nus that the Supreme Court is the appointed arbiter of all controversies\r\nbetween a State and the general government.  Why, then, do they not\r\nleave this controversy to that tribunal?  Why do they not confide to\r\nthem the abrogation of the ordinance, and the laws made in pursuance of\r\nit, and the assertion of that supremacy which they claim for the laws\r\nof Congress?  The State stands pledged to resist no process of the\r\ncourt.  Why, then, confer on the President the extensive and unlimited\r\npowers provided in this bill?  Why authorize him to use military force\r\nto arrest the civil process of the State?  But one answer can be given:\r\nThat, in a contest between the State and the general government, if the\r\nresistance be limited on both sides to the civil process, the State, by\r\nits inherent sovereignty, standing upon its reserved powers, will prove\r\ntoo powerful in such a controversy, and must triumph over the Federal\r\ngovernment, sustained by its delegated and limited authority; and in\r\nthis answer we have an acknowledgment of the truth of those great\r\nprinciples for which the State has so firmly and nobly contended....\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been said, I may say that neither the\r\nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Clayton), nor any other who has spoken on\r\nthe same side, has directly and fairly met the great question at issue:\r\nIs this a Federal Union? a union of States, as distinct from that of\r\nindividuals?  Is the sovereignty in the several States, or in the\r\nAmerican people in the aggregate?  The very language which we are\r\ncompelled to use when speaking of our political institutions affords\r\nproof conclusive as to its real character.  The terms union, federal,\r\nunited, all imply a combination of sovereignties, a confederation of\r\nStates.  They never apply to an association of individuals.  Who ever\r\nheard of the United State of New York, of Massachusetts, or of\r\nVirginia?  Who ever heard the term federal or union applied to the\r\naggregation of individuals into one community?  Nor is the other point\r\nless clear--that the sovereignty is in the several States, and that our\r\nsystem is a union of twenty-four sovereign powers, under a\r\nconstitutional compact, and not of a divided sovereignty between the\r\nStates severally and the United States?  In spite of all that has been\r\nsaid, I maintain that sovereignty is in its nature indivisible.  It is\r\nthe supreme power in a State, and we might just as well speak of half a\r\nsquare, or half of a triangle, as of half a sovereignty.  It is a gross\r\nerror to confound the *exercise* of sovereign powers with *sovereignty*\r\nitself, or the *delegation* of such powers with the *surrender* of\r\nthem.  A sovereign may delegate his powers to be exercised by as many\r\nagents as he may think proper, under such conditions and with such\r\nlimitations as he may impose; but to surrender any portion of his\r\nsovereignty to another is to annihilate the whole.  The Senator from\r\nDelaware (Mr. Clayton) calls this metaphysical reasoning, which he says\r\nhe cannot comprehend.  If by metaphysics he means that scholastic\r\nrefinement which makes distinctions without difference, no one can hold\r\nit in more utter contempt than I do; but if, on the contrary, he means\r\nthe power of analysis and combination--that power which reduces the\r\nmost complex idea into its elements, which traces causes to their first\r\nprinciple, and, by the power of generalization and combination, unites\r\nthe whole in one harmonious system--then, so far from deserving\r\ncontempt, it is the highest attribute of the human mind.  It is the\r\npower which raises man above the brute--which distinguishes his\r\nfaculties from mere sagacity, which he holds in common with inferior\r\nanimals.  It is this power which has raised the astronomer from being a\r\nmere gazer at the stars to the high intellectual eminence of a Newton\r\nor a Laplace, and astronomy itself from a mere observation of isolated\r\nfacts into that noble science which displays to our admiration the\r\nsystem of the universe.  And shall this high power of the mind, which\r\nhas effected such wonders when directed to the laws which control the\r\nmaterial world, be forever prohibited, under a senseless cry of\r\nmetaphysics, from being applied to the high purposes of political\r\nscience and legislation?  I hold them to be subject to laws as fixed as\r\nmatter itself, and to be as fit a subject for the application of the\r\nhighest intellectual power.  Denunciation may, indeed, fall upon the\r\nphilosophical inquirer into these first principles, as it did upon\r\nGalileo and Bacon, when they first unfolded the great discoveries which\r\nhave immortalized their names; but the time will come when truth will\r\nprevail in spite of prejudice and denunciation, and when politics and\r\nlegislation will be considered as much a science as astronomy and\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this part of the subject, I understood the Senator\r\nfrom Virginia (Mr. Rives) to say that sovereignty was divided, and that\r\na portion remained with the States severally, and that the residue was\r\nvested in the Union.  By Union, I suppose, the Senator meant the United\r\nStates. If such be his meaning--if he intended to affirm that the\r\nsovereignty was in the twenty-four States, in whatever light he may\r\nview them, our opinions will not disagree; but according to my\r\nconception, the whole sovereignty is in the several States, while the\r\nexercise of sovereign power is divided--a part being exercised under\r\ncompact, through this general government, and the residue through the\r\nseparate State governments.  But if the Senator from Virginia (Mr.\r\nRives) means to assert that the twenty-four States form but one\r\ncommunity, with a single sovereign power as to the objects of the\r\nUnion, it will be but the revival of the old question, of whether the\r\nUnion is a union between States, as distinct communities, or a mere\r\naggregate of the American people, as a mass of individuals; and in this\r\nlight his opinions would lead directly to consolidation....\r\n\r\nDisguise it as you may, the controversy is one between power and\r\nliberty; and I tell the gentlemen who are opposed to me, that, as\r\nstrong as may be the love of power on their side, the love of liberty\r\nis still stronger on ours.  History furnishes many instances of similar\r\nstruggles, where the love of liberty has prevailed against power under\r\nevery disadvantage, and among them few more striking than that of our\r\nown Revolution; where, as strong as was the parent country, and feeble\r\nas were the Colonies, yet, under the impulse of liberty, and the\r\nblessing of God, they gloriously triumphed in the contest.  There are,\r\nindeed, many striking analogies between that and the present\r\ncontroversy.  They both originated substantially in the same\r\ncause--with this difference--in the present case, the power of taxation\r\nis converted into that of regulating industry; in the other the power\r\nof regulating industry, by the regulation of commerce, was attempted to\r\nbe converted into the power of taxation.  Were I to trace the analogy\r\nfurther, we should find that the perversion of the taxing power, in the\r\none case, has given precisely the same control to the northern section\r\nover the industry of the southern section of the Union, which the power\r\nto regulate commerce gave to Great Britain over the industry of the\r\nColonies in the other; and that the very articles in which the Colonies\r\nwere permitted to have a free trade, and those in which the\r\nmother-country had a monopoly, are almost identically the same as those\r\nin which the Southern States are permitted to have a free trade by the\r\nAct of 1832, and in which the Northern States have, by the same act,\r\nsecured a monopoly.  The only difference is in the means.  In the\r\nformer, the Colonies were permitted to have a free trade with all\r\ncountries south of Cape Finisterre, a cape in the northern part of\r\nSpain; while north of that, the trade of the Colonies was prohibited,\r\nexcept through the mother-country, by means of her commercial\r\nregulations.  If we compare the products of the country north and south\r\nof Cape Finisterre, we shall find them almost identical with the list\r\nof last year.  Nor does the analogy terminate here.  The very arguments\r\nresorted to at the commencement of the American Revolution, and the\r\nmeasures adopted, and the motives assigned to bring on that contest (to\r\nenforce the law), are almost identically the same.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression to the consideration of the bill.\r\nWhatever difference of opinion may exist upon other points, there is\r\none on which I should suppose there can be none; that this bill rests\r\nupon principles which, if carried out, will ride over State\r\nsovereignties, and that it will be idle for any advocates hereafter to\r\ntalk of State rights.  The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Rives) says that\r\nhe is the advocate of State rights; but he must permit me to tell him\r\nthat, although he may differ in premises from the other gentlemen with\r\nwhom he acts on this occasion, yet, in supporting this bill, he\r\nobliterates every vestige of distinction between him and them, saving\r\nonly that, professing the principles of '98, his example will be more\r\npernicious than that of the most open and bitter opponent of the rights\r\nof the States.  I will also add, what I am compelled to say, that I\r\nmust consider him (Mr. Rives) as less consistent than our old\r\nopponents, whose conclusions were fairly drawn from their premises,\r\nwhile his premises ought to have led him to opposite conclusions.  The\r\ngentleman has told us that the new-fangled doctrines, as he chooses to\r\ncall them, have brought State rights into disrepute.  I must tell him,\r\nin reply, that what he calls new-fangled are but the doctrines of '98;\r\nand that it is he (Mr. Rives), and others with him, who, professing\r\nthese doctrines, have degraded them by explaining away their meaning\r\nand efficacy.\r\n\r\nHe (Mr. R.) has disclaimed, in behalf of Virginia, the authorship of\r\nnullification.  I will not dispute that point.  If Virginia chooses to\r\nthrow away one of her brightest ornaments, she must not hereafter\r\ncomplain that it has become the property of another.  But while I have,\r\nas a representatives of Carolina, no right to complain of the disavowal\r\nof the Senator from Virginia, I must believe that he (Mr. R.) has done\r\nhis native State great injustice by declaring on this floor, that when\r\nshe gravely resolved, in '98, that \"in cases of deliberate and\r\ndangerous infractions of the Constitution, the States, as parties to\r\nthe compact, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose to\r\narrest the progress of the evil, and to maintain within their\r\nrespective limits the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining\r\nto them,\" she meant no more than to proclaim the right to protest and\r\nto remonstrate.  To suppose that, in putting forth so solemn a\r\ndeclaration, which she afterward sustained by so able and elaborate an\r\nargument, she meant no more than to assert what no one had ever denied,\r\nwould be to suppose that the State had been guilty of the most\r\negregious trifling that ever was exhibited on so solemn an occasion.",
