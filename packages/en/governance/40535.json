In a matter that has such obvious material aspects as\r\nthe immigration problem the abstract principles involved are likely\r\nto be overlooked. But as there can be no sound conclusions without a\r\nfoundation in underlying principles, this discussion must begin by\r\nseeking an answer to the ethical question involved.\r\n\r\nThe second question is not easy to answer for the reason that men are\r\nalways poor judges of their contemporaries, especially of those whose\r\ninterests appear to clash with their own. We suffer here, too, from\r\na bewildering multiplicity of testimony. Every sort of expert whose\r\nspecialty in any way touches the immigrant has diagnosed the subject\r\naccording to the formulæ of his own special science--and our doctors\r\ndisagree! One is forced to give up the luxury of a second-hand opinion\r\non this subject, and to attempt a little investigation of one's own,\r\nchecking off the dicta of the specialists as well as an amateur may.\r\n\r\nThe third question, while not wholly separable from the second, is\r\nnevertheless an inquiry of another sort. Whether immigration is good for\r\nus depends partly on the intrinsic nature of the immigrant and partly\r\non our reactions to his presence. The effects of immigration, produced\r\nby the immigrant in partnership with ourselves, some men will approve\r\nand some deplore, according to their notions of good and bad. That thing\r\nis good for me which leads to my ultimate happiness; and we do not all\r\ndelight in the same things. The third question, therefore, more than\r\neither of the others, each man has to answer for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY WHO KNOCK AT OUR GATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF THE FATHERS\r\n\r\nAnd these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:\r\nand thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children. . . . And\r\nthou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.\r\n\r\nDeut. vi, 6, 7, 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I ask an American what is the fundamental American law, and he does\r\nnot answer me promptly, \"That which is contained in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence,\" I put him down for a poor citizen. He who is ignorant of\r\nthe law is likely to disobey it. And there cannot be two minds about\r\nthe position of the Declaration among our documents of state. What the\r\nMosaic Law is to the Jews, the Declaration is to the American people. It\r\naffords us a starting-point in history and defines our mission among the\r\nnations. Without it, we should not differ greatly from other nations who\r\nhave achieved a constitutional form of government and various democratic\r\ninstitutions. What marks us out from other advanced nations is the\r\norigin of our liberties in one supreme act of political innovation,\r\nprompted by a conscious sense of the dignity of manhood. In other\r\ncountries advances have been made by favor of hereditary rulers and\r\naristocratic parliaments, each successive reform being grudgingly handed\r\ndown to the people from above. Not so in America. At one bold stroke we\r\nshattered the monarchical tradition, and installed the people in the\r\nseats of government, substituting the gospel of the sovereignty of the\r\nmasses for the superstition of the divine right of kings.\r\n\r\nAnd even more notable than the boldness of the act was the dignity with\r\nwhich it was entered upon. In terms befitting a philosophical discourse,\r\nwe gave notice to the world that what we were about to do, we would do\r\nin the name of humanity, in the conviction that as justice is the end of\r\ngovernment so should manhood be its source.\r\n\r\nIt is this insistence on the philosophic sanction of our revolt that\r\ngives the sublime touch to our political performance. Up to the moment\r\nof our declaration of independence, our struggle with our English\r\nrulers did not differ from other popular struggles against despotic\r\ngovernments. Again and again we respectfully petitioned for redress\r\nof specific grievances, as the governed, from time immemorial, have\r\npetitioned their governors. But one day we abandoned our suit for\r\npetty damages, and instituted a suit for the recovery of our entire\r\nhuman heritage of freedom; and by basing our claim on the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the brotherhood of man and the sovereignty of the masses,\r\nwe assumed the championship of the oppressed against their oppressors,\r\nwherever found.\r\n\r\nIt was thus, by sinking our particular quarrel with George of England\r\nin the universal quarrel of humanity with injustice, that we emerged a\r\ndistinct nation, with a unique mission in the world. And we revealed\r\nourselves to the world in the Declaration of Independence, even as\r\nthe Israelites revealed themselves in the Law of Moses. From the\r\nDeclaration flows our race consciousness, our sense of what is and\r\nwhat is not American. Our laws, our policies, the successive steps of\r\nour progress--all must conform to the spirit of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the source of our national being.\r\n\r\nThe American confession of faith, therefore, is a recital of the\r\ndoctrines of liberty and equality. A faithful American is one who\r\nunderstands these doctrines and applies them in his life.\r\n\r\nIt should be easy to pick out the true Americans--the spiritual heirs\r\nof the founders of our Republic--by this simple test of loyalty to\r\nthe principles of the Declaration. To such a test we are put, both as\r\na nation and as individuals, every time we are asked to define our\r\nattitude on immigration. Having set up a government on a declaration\r\nof the rights of man, it should be our first business to reaffirm that\r\ndeclaration every time we meet a case involving human rights. Now\r\nevery immigrant who emerges from the steerage presents such a case.\r\nFor the alien, whatever ethnic or geographic label he carries, in a\r\nprimary classification of the creatures of the earth, falls in the human\r\nfamily. The fundamental fact of his humanity established, we need only\r\nrehearse the articles of our political faith to know what to do with the\r\nimmigrant. It is written in our basic law that he is entitled to life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. There is nothing left for us to\r\ndo but to open wide our gates and set him on his way to happiness.\r\n\r\nThat is what we did for a while, when our simple law was fresh in our\r\nminds, and the habit of applying it instinctive. Then there arose\r\na fashion of spelling immigration with a capital initial, which\r\nso confused the national eye that we began to see a PROBLEM where\r\nformerly we had seen a familiar phenomenon of American life; and as a\r\nproblem requires skillful handling, we called an army of experts in\r\nconsultation, and the din of their elaborate discussions has filled our\r\nears ever since.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the nation has been disastrous. In a matter involving\r\nour faith as Americans, we have ceased to consult our fundamental\r\nlaw, and have suffered ourselves to be guided by the conflicting\r\nreports of commissions and committees, anthropologists, economists, and\r\nstatisticians, policy-mongers, calamity-howlers, and self-announced\r\nprophets. Matters irrelevant to the interests of liberty have taken the\r\nfirst place in the discussion; lobbyists, not patriots, have had the\r\nlast word. Our American sensibility has become dulled, so that sometimes\r\nthe cries of the oppressed have not reached our ears unless carried by\r\nformal deputations. In a department of government which brings us into\r\ndaily touch with the nations of the world, we have failed to live up to\r\nour national gospel and have not been aware of our backsliding.\r\n\r\nWhat have the experts and statisticians done so to pervert our minds?\r\nThey have filled volumes with facts and figures, comparing the\r\nimmigrants of to-day with the immigrants of other days, classifying them\r\nas to race, nationality, and culture, tabulating their occupations,\r\nanalyzing their savings, probing their motives, prophesying their\r\nultimate destiny. But what is there in all this that bears on the right\r\nof free men to choose their place of residence? Granted that Sicilians\r\nare not Scotchmen, how does that affect the right of a Sicilian to\r\ntravel in pursuit of happiness? Strip the alien down to his anatomy,\r\nyou still find a _man_, a creature made in the image of God; and\r\nconcerning such a one we have definite instructions from the founders\r\nof the Republic. And what purpose was served by the bloody tide of the\r\nCivil War if it did not wash away the last lingering doubts as to the\r\nbrotherhood of men of different races?\r\n\r\nThere is no impropriety in gathering together a mass of scientific and\r\nsociological data concerning the newcomers, as long as we understand\r\nthat the knowledge so gained is merely the technical answer to a number\r\nof technical questions. Where we have gone wrong is in applying the\r\ntestimony of our experts to the moral side of the question. By all means\r\nregister the cephalic index of the alien,--the anthropologist will make\r\nsomething of it at his leisure,--but do not let it determine his right\r\nto life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nI do not ask that we remove all restrictions and let the flood of\r\nimmigration sweep in unchecked. I do ask that such restrictions as we\r\nimpose shall accord with the loftiest interpretation of our duty as\r\nAmericans. Now our first duty is to live up to the gospel of liberty,\r\nthrough the political practices devised by our forefathers and modified\r\nby their successors, as democratic ideas developed. But political\r\npractices require a territory wherein to operate--democracy must have\r\nstanding-room--so it becomes our next duty to guard our frontiers. For\r\nthat purpose we maintain two forms of defense: the barbaric devices\r\nof army and navy, to ward off hostile mass invasions; and the humane\r\ndevices of the immigration service, to regulate the influx of peaceable\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of examples to copy in our military defenses, but when\r\nit comes to the civil branch of our national guard, we dare not borrow\r\nforeign models. What our neighbors are doing in the matter of regulating\r\nimmigration may or may not be right for us. Other nations may be guided\r\nchiefly by economic considerations, while we are under spiritual bonds\r\nto give first consideration to the moral principles involved. For\r\nthis, our peculiar American problem, we must seek a characteristically\r\nAmerican solution.\r\n\r\nWhat terms of entry may we impose on the immigrant without infringing on\r\nhis inalienable rights, as defined in our national charter? Just such\r\nas we would impose on our own citizens if they proposed to move about\r\nthe country in companies numbering thousands, with their families and\r\nportable belongings. And what would these conditions be? They would be\r\nsuch as are required by public safety, public health, public order.\r\nWhatever limits to our personal liberty we are ourselves willing to\r\nendure for the sake of the public welfare, we have a right to impose on\r\nthe stranger from abroad; these, and no others.\r\n\r\nHas, then, the newest arrival the same rights as the established\r\ncitizen? According to the Declaration, yes; the same right to live, to\r\nmove, to try his luck. More than this he does not claim at the gate of\r\nentrance; with less than this we are not authorized to put him off.\r\nWe do not question the right of an individual foreigner to enter our\r\ncountry on any peaceable errand; why, then, question the rights of a\r\nshipload of foreigners? Lumping a thousand men together under the title\r\nof immigrants does not deprive them of their humanity and the rights\r\ninherent in humanity; or can it be demonstrated that the sum of the\r\nrights of a million men is less than the rights of one individual?\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence, like the Ten Commandments, must be\r\ntaken literally and applied universally. What would have been the\r\ncivilizing power of the Mosaic Code if the Children of Israel had\r\nrepudiated it after a few generations? As little virtue is there in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence if we limit its operation to any\r\ngeographical sphere or historical period or material situation. How do\r\nwe belittle the works of our Fathers when we talk as though they wrought\r\nfor their contemporaries only! It was no great matter to shake off the\r\nrule of an absent tyrant, if that is all that the War of the Revolution\r\ndid. So much had been done many times over, long before the first tree\r\nfell under the axe of a New England settler. Emmaus was fought before\r\nYorktown, and Thermopylæ before Emmaus. It is only as we dwell on the\r\nwords of Jefferson and Franklin that the deeds of Washington shine out\r\namong the deeds of heroes. In the chronicles of the Jews, Moses has a\r\nfar higher place than the Maccabæan brothers. And notice that Moses\r\nowes his immortality to the unbroken succession of generations who\r\nwere willing to rule their lives by the Law that fell from his lips.\r\nThe glory of the Jews is not that they received the Law, but that they\r\nkept the Law. The glory of the American people must be that the vision\r\nvouchsafed to their fathers they in their turn hold up undimmed to the\r\neyes of successive generations.\r\n\r\nTo maintain our own independence is only to hug that vision to our own\r\nbosoms. If we sincerely believe in the elevating power of liberty, we\r\nshould hasten to extend the reign of liberty over all mankind. The\r\ndisciples of Jesus did not sit down in Jerusalem and congratulate each\r\nother on having found the Saviour. They scattered over the world to\r\nspread the tidings far and wide. We Americans, disciples of the goddess\r\nLiberty, are saved the trouble of carrying our gospel to the nations,\r\nbecause the nations come to us.\r\n\r\nRight royally have we welcomed them, and lavishly entertained them at\r\nthe feast of freedom, whenever our genuine national impulses have shaped\r\nour immigration policy. But from time to time the national impulse has\r\nbeen clogged by selfish fears and foolish alarms parading under the\r\nguise of civic prudence. Ignoring entirely the _rights_ of the case,\r\nthe immigration debate has raged about questions of expediency, as if\r\nconvenience and not justice were our first concern. At times the debate\r\nhas been led by men on whom the responsibilities of American citizenship\r\nsat lightly, who treated immigration as a question of the division of\r\nspoils.\r\n\r\nA little attention to the principles involved would have convinced us\r\nlong ago that an American citizen who preaches wholesale restriction\r\nof immigration is guilty of political heresy. The Declaration of\r\nIndependence accords to _all_ men an equal share in the inherent rights\r\nof humanity. When we go contrary to that principle, we are not acting\r\nas Americans; for, by definition, an American is one who lives by the\r\nprinciples of the Declaration. And we surely violate the Declaration\r\nwhen we attempt to exclude aliens on account of race, nationality, or\r\neconomic status. \"All men\" means yellow men as well as white men, men\r\nfrom the South of Europe as well as men from the North of Europe, men\r\nwho hold kingdoms in pawn, and men who owe for their dinner. We shall\r\nhave to recall officially the Declaration of Independence before we can\r\nlawfully limit the application of its principles to this or that group\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nAmericans of refined civic conscience have always accepted our\r\nnational gospel in its literal sense. \"What becomes of the rights of\r\nthe excluded?\" demanded the younger Garrison, in a noble scolding\r\nadministered to the restrictionists in 1896.\r\n\r\n    If a nation has a right to keep out aliens, tell us how many people\r\n    constitute a nation, and what geographical area they have a right\r\n    to claim. In the United States, where a thousand millions can live\r\n    in peace and plenty under just conditions, who gives to seventy\r\n    millions the right to monopolize the territory? How few can justly\r\n    own the earth, and deprive those who are landless of the right to\r\n    life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? And what becomes of the\r\n    rights of the excluded?\r\n\r\nIf we took our mission seriously,--as seriously, say, as the Jews take\r\ntheirs,--we should live with a copy of our law at our side, and oblige\r\nevery man who opened his mouth to teach us, to square his doctrine with\r\nthe gospel of liberty; and him should we follow to the end who spoke to\r\nus in the name of our duties, rather than in the name of our privileges.\r\n\r\nThe sins we have been guilty of in our conduct of the immigration debate\r\nhave had their roots in a misconception of our own position in the\r\nland. We have argued the matter as though we owned the land, and were,\r\ntherefore, at liberty to receive or reject the unbidden guests who came\r\nto us by thousands. Let any man who lays claim to any portion of the\r\nterritory of the United States produce his title deed. Are not most of\r\nus squatters here, and squatters of recent date at that? The rights of\r\na squatter are limited to the plot he actually occupies and cultivates.\r\nThe portion of the United States territory that is covered by squatters'\r\nclaims is only a fraction, albeit a respectable fraction, of the land we\r\ngovern. In the name of what moral law do we wield a watchman's club over\r\nthe vast regions that are still waiting to be staked out? The number of\r\nAmerican citizens who can boast of ancestral acres is not sufficient\r\nto swing a presidential election. For that matter, those whose claims\r\nare founded on ancestral tenure should be the very ones to dread an\r\nexamination of titles. For it would be shown that these few got their\r\nlands by stepping into dead men's shoes, while the majority wrenched\r\ntheir estates from the wilderness by the labor of their own hands. In\r\nthe face of the sturdy American preference for an aristocracy of brain\r\nand brawn, the wisest thing the man with a pedigree can do is to scrape\r\nthe lichens off his family tree. Think of having it shown that he owes\r\nthe ancestral farmhouse to the deathbed favoritism of some grouchy\r\nuncle! Or, worse still, think of tracing the family title to some canny\r\ndeal with a band of unsophisticated Indians!\r\n\r\nNo, it will not do to lay claim to the land on the ground of priority\r\nof occupation, as long as there is a red man left on the Indian\r\nreservations. If it comes to calling names, usurper is an uglier name\r\nthan alien. And a squatter is a tenant who doesn't pay any rent,\r\nwhile an immigrant who occupies a tenement in the slums pays his rent\r\nregularly or gets out.\r\n\r\nWe may soothe our pride with the reflection that our title to the land\r\ndoes not depend on the moral validity of individual claims, but on the\r\ncollective right of the nation to control the land we govern. We came\r\ninto our land as other nations came into theirs: we took it as a prize\r\nof war. Until humanity has devised a less brutal method of political\r\nacquisition, we must pass our national claim as entirely sound. We own\r\nthe land because we were strong enough to take it from England. But\r\nthe moment we hark back to the War of the Revolution, our sense of\r\npossession is profoundly modified. We did not quarrel with the English\r\nabout the possession of the colonies, but about their treatment of the\r\ncolonists. It was not a land-grab that was plotted in Independence\r\nHall in 1776, but a pattern of human freedom. We entered upon the war\r\nin pursuit of ideals, not in pursuit of homesteads. We had to take the\r\nhomesteads, too, because, as we have already noted, a political ideal\r\nhas to have territory wherein to operate. But we must never forget that\r\nthe shining prize of that war was an immaterial thing,--the triumph of\r\nan idea. Not the Treaty of Paris, but the Declaration of Independence,\r\nconverted the thirteen colonies into a nation.\r\n\r\nHaving taken half a continent in the name of humanity, shall we hold it\r\nin the name of a few millions? Not as jealous lords of a rich domain,\r\nbut as priests of a noble cult shall we best acquit ourselves of the\r\ntask our Fathers set us. And it is the duty of a priest to minister to\r\nas many souls as he can reach. The most revered of our living teachers\r\nhas passed this word:--\r\n\r\n    It is the mission of the United States to spread freedom throughout\r\n    the world by teaching as many men and women as possible in freedom's\r\n    largest home how to use freedom rightly through practice in liberty\r\n    under law.\r\n\r\nAnd our ardor shall not be dampened by the reflection that perhaps\r\nthe Fathers builded better than they knew. \"Do you really think they\r\nlooked so far ahead?\" it is often asked. \"Did the founders of the\r\nRepublic foresee the time when foreign hordes would alight on our\r\nshores, demanding a share in this goodly land that was ransomed with the\r\nblood of heroes?\" Fearful questions, these, to make us pause in the work\r\nof redeeming mankind! If our Fathers did not foresee the whole future,\r\nshall we therefore be blind to the light of our own day? If they had\r\nleft us a mere sketch of their idea, could we do less than fill in the\r\noutlines? Since they left us not a sketch, but a finished model, the\r\nleast we can do is to go on copying it on an ever larger scale. Neither\r\nshall we falter because the execution of the enlarged copy entails much\r\nlabor on us and on our children. When Moses told the Egyptian exiles\r\nthat they should have no god but the One God, he may not have guessed\r\nthat their children would be brought to the stake for refusing other\r\ngods; and yet nineteen centuries of Jewish martyrdom go to show that\r\nthe followers of Moses did not make his lack of foresight an excuse for\r\nabandoning his Law.\r\n\r\nLet the children be brought up to know that we are a people with a\r\nmission, and that mission, in the words of Dr. Eliot, to teach the uses\r\nof freedom to as many men as possible \"in freedom's largest home.\"\r\nLet it be taught in the public schools that the most precious piece\r\nof real estate in the whole United States is that which supports the\r\npedestal of the Statue of Liberty; that we need not greatly care how\r\nthe three million square miles remaining is divided among the people of\r\nthe earth, as long as we retain that little island. Let it further be\r\nrepeated in the schools that the Liberty at our gates is the handiwork\r\nof a Frenchman; that the mountain-weight of copper in her sides and the\r\ngranite mass beneath her feet were bought with the pennies of the poor;\r\nthat the verses graven on a tablet within the base are the inspiration\r\nof a poetess descended from Portuguese Jews; and all these things shall\r\nbe interpreted to mean that the love of liberty unites all races and\r\nall classes of men into one close brotherhood, and that we Americans,\r\ntherefore, who have the utmost of liberty that has yet been attained,\r\nowe the alien a brother's share.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo this position we are brought by a construction of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence which makes of it the law of the land, binding on American\r\ncitizens individually and collectively, and in all circumstances\r\nwhatever. Out of this position there is one avenue of escape, and only\r\none. We may refuse to read in the Declaration a sincere expression of\r\nthe faith of 1776, and construe it instead as a bombastic political\r\nmanifesto, advanced by the leaders of the rebellion as an excuse for a\r\ngigantic land-grab.\r\n\r\nLet the descendants of the Puritans take their choice of these two\r\ninterpretations. For my part, I have chosen. I have chosen to read the\r\nstory of '76 as a chapter in sacred history; to set Thomas Jefferson in\r\na class with Moses, and Washington with Joshua; to regard the American\r\nnation as the custodian of a sacred trust, and American citizenship as a\r\nholy order, with laws and duties derived from the Declaration.\r\n\r\nFor very pride in my country I must choose thus, for the alternate\r\nview takes the meaning out of American history, reduces the War of\r\nIndependence to a war of plunder, and the Colonial heroes to a band of\r\npious hypocrites. What, indeed, shall we teach our children to be proud\r\nof if we reject the higher interpretation of the deeds of the Fathers?\r\nThe American Revolution as a campaign of conquest is not unique in\r\nhistory; on the contrary, it has been more than once surpassed, both in\r\nrespect to the prowess of the conquerors and to the magnificence of the\r\nprize. Outside the physical realm, where our inventions and discoveries\r\nand the material development of a continent belong, this country has\r\ncontributed nothing of moment to the world's progress, unless it is\r\nthat political adaptation of the Golden Rule which is indicated in\r\nthe Declaration and elaborated in the Constitution. In the arts and\r\nsciences we sit, for the most part, at the feet of foreign masters;\r\nin jurisprudence we have borrowed from the Romans, and the elements\r\nof liberal government we have from our next of kin, the English. The\r\nnotion of the dignity of man, which is the foundation of the gospel\r\nof democracy, is derived from Hebrew sources, as the Psalm-singing\r\nfounders of New England would be the first to acknowledge. It was\r\nnot entirely due to accident nor to the exigencies of pioneer life\r\nthat the meeting-house and the town hall were one in the New England\r\nsettlements. The influence of the Bible is plainly stamped on the works\r\nof the Puritans. What, then, shall we claim as the great American\r\nachievement, our peculiar treasure in the midst of so much borrowed\r\nglory? A magnificent espousal of humanity--that or nothing can we call\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nSeeing that they brought nothing into the world that was all their\r\nown, our glorious dead are not glorious unless we make them so, by\r\nimputing to them the noblest motives that their case will permit, and\r\nrating their works at not less than face value. Pride demands it, and,\r\nfortunately for our country's honor, justice supports the claims of\r\npride. Neither the cynics nor the enthusiasts shall have the last word\r\nin the matter. In the writings of their contemporaries, in the casual\r\nsayings of their intimates, in the critical comments of those who\r\ncame next after them, we find convincing evidence that in the minds\r\nof the leaders of '76 the most advanced political thought of the age\r\ncrystallized into a mighty conviction--the conviction of the inherent\r\nnobility of humankind, which makes it treason for any man to enslave his\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\nThat is the thought that was sent out into the world on July 4, 1776,\r\nand because that thought has shaped our history, we call it the\r\nbasic law of our land, and the Declaration of Independence our final\r\nauthority. If under that authority the immigrant appears to have rights\r\nin our land parallel to our own rights, we shall not lightly deny his\r\nclaims, lest we forfeit our only title to national glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nJUDGES IN THE GATE\r\n\r\nJudges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates . . . and\r\nthey shall judge the people with just judgment.\r\n\r\nDeut. xvi, 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so potent in a public debate as the picturesque\r\ncatchwords in which leaders of thought sum up their convictions. Logic\r\nmakes fewer converts in a year than a taking phrase makes in a week.\r\nFor catchwords are the popular substitute for logic, and the man in the\r\nstreet is reduced to silence by a good round phrase of the kind that\r\nsticks.\r\n\r\nTwo classes of citizens are especially prone to fall under the tyranny\r\nof phrases: those whose horizon, through no fault of their own, is\r\nlimited by the rim of an empty dinner-pail; and those whose view of\r\nthe universe is obstructed by the kitchen-middens of too many dinners.\r\nThere is no clear thinking on an empty stomach, and equally muddled are\r\nthe thoughts of the over-full. When I hear of a public measure that is\r\nlargely supported by these two classes of citizens, I know at once that\r\nthe measure appeals to human prejudices rather than to divine reason.\r\n\r\nThus I became suspicious of the restrictionist movement when I realized\r\nthat it was in greatest favor among the thoughtless poor and the\r\nthoughtless rich. I am well aware that the high-priests of the cult\r\ninclude some of the most conscientious thinkers that ever helped to make\r\nhistory, and their earnestness is attested by a considerable body of\r\ndoctrine, in support of which they quote statistics and special studies\r\nand scientific investigations. But I notice that the rank and file of\r\nrestrictionists do not know as much as the titles of these documents.\r\nThey have not followed the argument at all; they have only caught the\r\ncatchwords of restrictionism. And these catchwords are the sort that\r\nappeal to the mean spots in human nature,--the distrust of the stranger,\r\nthe jealousy of possession, the cowardice of the stomach. Nothing else\r\nis expressed by such phrases as \"the scum of Europe,\" \"the exploitation\r\nof America's wealth,\" or \"taking the bread from the mouth of the\r\nAmerican workingman.\"\r\n\r\nEven the least venomous formula of restrictionism, \"immigration isn't\r\nwhat it used to be,\" raises such a familiar echo of foolish human nature\r\nthat I am bound to challenge its veracity. Does not every generation cry\r\nthat the weather isn't what it used to be, children are not what they\r\nused to be, society is not what it used to be? \"The good old times\" and\r\n\"the old immigration\" may be twin illusions of limited human vision.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that immigration is not what it used to be, the fact\r\nwill appear from a detailed comparison of the \"old\" and the \"new\"\r\nimmigration. But which of the immigrant stocks of the good old times\r\nshall be taken as a standard? Woman's wisdom urges me to go right back\r\nto the original pattern, just as I would do if I went to the shops to\r\nmatch samples. And the original pattern was brought to this country in\r\nthe year 1620. Surely comparison with the Mayflower stock is the most\r\nsearching test of the quality of our immigration that any one could\r\npropose.\r\n\r\nThe predominant virtue of the Pilgrims was idealism. The things of the\r\nspirit were more to them than the things of the flesh. May we say the\r\nlike of our present immigrants? Of very many of them, yes; a thousand\r\ntimes yes. Of the 8,213,000 foreigners landed between the years 1899\r\nand 1909, 990,000 were of that race which for nineteen centuries has\r\nsacrificed its flesh in the service of the spirit. It takes a hundred\r\ntimes as much steadfastness and endurance for a Russian Jew of to-day\r\nto remain a Jew as it took for an English Protestant in the seventeenth\r\ncentury to defy the established Church.\r\n\r\nThose who think that with the Spanish Inquisition Jewish martyrdom came\r\nto an end are asked to remember that the Kishinieff affair is only\r\neight years behind us, and that Bielostock has been heard from since\r\nKishinieff, and Mohileff since Bielostock. And more terrible than the\r\nrecurrent _pogrom_, which hacks and burns and tortures a few hundreds\r\nnow and then, is the continuous bloodless martyrdom of the six million\r\nJews in Russia through the operation of the anti-Semitic laws of that\r\ncountry. Thirty minutes spent in looking over a summary of these laws\r\nrecently compiled by an English historian(1) will convince any reader\r\nwith a spark of imagination that every Russian Jewish immigrant to-day\r\nis a fugitive from religious persecution, even as were the English\r\nimmigrants of 1620.\r\n\r\n  (1) Lucien Wolf, _Legal Sufferings of the Jews in Russia_.\r\n\r\nBut while nobody questions the idealism of the Jew in religion, the\r\nworld has been very slow to credit him with any degree of civic\r\ndevotion. The world did not stop to think that a man has to have a\r\ncountry before he can prove himself a good citizen. But happily in\r\nrecent times he has been put to the test of civic opportunity, notably\r\nin America; with the result that he was found to possess a fair share of\r\nthe civic virtues, from the generosity displayed in the town meeting,\r\nwhen citizens vote away their substance to support a public cause, to\r\nthe brute heroism of the battle-field, where mangled flesh gives proof\r\nof valiant spirit.(2) And what the Jews of West European stock proved\r\nin the American wars for freedom the Jews of Eastern Europe have proved\r\nmore recently, by their forwardness in the Russian revolution of 1905.\r\n\r\n  (2) See _The Jews in America_, by Rev. Madison C. Peters.\r\n\r\nNo group of people of all the heterogeneous mass that constitutes the\r\nRussian nation were half so prominent as the Jews in that abortive\r\nattempt at freedom. Witness the police records of the revolutionary\r\nperiod, which show that sixty-five out of every hundred political\r\noffenders were Jews, in districts where the population was fifteen parts\r\nJewish and eighty-five parts Gentile. When I visited my native town in\r\nthe Pale, several years after the revolution, it was hard to find, among\r\nthe young men and women I talked with, one in a dozen who had not shared\r\nin the dangers of 1905. If we really want to know how heartily the\r\nJews played their part in the revolution, we need only ask the Russian\r\nGovernment why the anti-Semitic laws have been so vengefully enforced\r\nsince a certain crimson year within the present decade. And the whole\r\nsignificance of these things, in the present study, lies in the fact\r\nthat precisely that spirit which prompts to rebellion in despotic Russia\r\nrallies in free America to the support of existing institutions.\r\n\r\nIf it was a merit in 1620 to flee from religious persecution, and in\r\n1776 to fight against political oppression, then many of the Russian\r\nrefugees of to-day are a little ahead of the Mayflower troop, because\r\nthey have in their own lifetime sustained the double ordeal of fight and\r\nflight, with all their attendant risks and shocks.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a nice balance between the relative merits of these two\r\ngroups of rebels, we remind ourselves that, for sheer adventurousness,\r\nmigration to America to-day is not to be mentioned on the same page with\r\nthe magnificent exploit of 1620, and we reflect that the moral glory of\r\nthe revolution of 1776 is infinitely greater than that of any subsequent\r\nrevolt; because that, too, was a path-finding adventure, with no compass\r\nbut faith, no chart but philosophical invention. On the other hand, it\r\nis plain that the Russian revolutionists moved against greater odds\r\nthan the American colonists had to face. The Russians had to plot in\r\nsecret, assemble in the dark, and strike with bare fists; all this under\r\nthe very nose of the Czar, with the benighted condition of the Russian\r\nmasses hanging like a cloud over their enterprise. The colonists were\r\nable to lay the train of revolution in the most public manner, they had\r\nthe local government in their hands, a considerable militia obedient\r\nto their own captains, and the advantage of distance from the enemy's\r\nresources, with a populace advanced in civic experience promising\r\nsupport to the leaders.\r\n\r\nAnd what a test of heroism was that which the harsh nature of the\r\nRussian Government afforded! The American rebels risked their charters\r\nand their property; for some of them dungeons waited, and for the\r\nleaders dangled a rope, no doubt. But confiscation is not so bitter as\r\nSiberian exile, and a halter is less painful than the barbed whip of the\r\nCossacks. The Minutemen at Concord Bridge defied a bully; the rioters\r\nin St. Petersburg challenged a tiger. And first of all to be thrust\r\ninto the cage would be the rebels of Jewish faith, and nobody knew that\r\nbetter than the Jews themselves.\r\n\r\nThe superior zeal and high degree of self-sacrifice displayed by the\r\nJewish revolutionists would naturally be explained by the fact that,\r\nof all the peoples held in chains by the Russian Government, the Jews\r\nare the ones who have suffered the cruelest oppression. But there is\r\nproof, proof that will go down with the stream of history, that the\r\nJewish participants in the Russian revolution of 1905 were actuated by\r\nthe highest patriotism, their peculiar grievances being forgotten in the\r\ngrievances of the nation as a whole. The sinking of the Jewish question\r\nin the national question was an important article of the revolutionary\r\npropaganda among the Jews; so much so, that when a prominent Jewish\r\nleader attempted to demonstrate, on philosophical grounds, that that was\r\na false position to take, he was hotly repudiated, although up to that\r\ntime he had stood high in the councils of the leaders.(3)\r\n\r\n  (3) See Article by Achad Ha'am, _American Hebrew_, June 21, 1907.\r\n\r\nIf we find such a high degree of civic responsiveness in what we have\r\nbeen trained to think the most unlikely quarter, shall we not look\r\nhopefully in other corners of our world of immigrants? If the Jewish\r\nspirit of freedom leaps from the grave of Barkochla to the hovels of\r\nthe Russian ghetto, half across the world and half across the civilized\r\nera, shall we not look for similar prodigies from the more recent graves\r\nof Kosciuszko and Garibaldi? If the hook-nosed tailor can turn hero on\r\noccasion, why not the grinning organ-grinder, and the surly miner, and\r\nthe husky lumber-jack? We experienced a shock of surprise, a little\r\nwhile ago, when troops of our Greek immigrants deserted the bootblacking\r\nparlors and fruit-stands and tumbled aboard anything that happened to\r\nsail for the Mediterranean, in their eagerness--it's hard to bring it\r\nout, in connection with a \"Dago\" bootblack!--in their eagerness to\r\nstrike a blow for their country in her need.\r\n\r\nBut that's the worst of calling names: it deceives those who do so.\r\nThe little bootblacks would not have fooled us as they did if we\r\nhad not recklessly summed up the Greek character in a contemptuous\r\nepithet. It is quite proper for street urchins to invent nicknames for\r\neverybody--that is what street urchins are for; but let us not hand down\r\nthe judgment of the gutter where the judgment of the senate is called\r\nfor. Between Leonidas at the pass and little Metro under the saloon\r\nwindow, fawning for our nickels, is indeed a dismal gap; and yet Metro,\r\nwhen occasion demanded, reached out his grimy hand and touched the tunic\r\nof the Spartan hero.\r\n\r\nFrom these unexpected exploits of the craven Jew and the degenerate\r\nGreek, it would seem as if the different elements of the despised \"new\"\r\nimmigration only await a spectacular opportunity to prove themselves\r\nequal to the \"old\" in civic valor. But if contemporary history fails\r\nto provide a war or revolution for each of our foreign nationalities,\r\nwe are still not without the means of gauging the idealistic capacity\r\nof the aliens. Next after liberty, the Puritans loved education; and\r\nto-day, if you examine the registers of the schools and colleges they\r\nfounded, you will find the names of recent immigrants thickly sprinkled\r\nfrom A to Z, and topping the honor ranks nine times out of ten. All\r\nreaders of newspapers know the bare facts,--each commencement season,\r\nthe prize-winners are announced in a string of unpronounceable foreign\r\nnames; and every school-teacher in the immigrant section of the larger\r\ncities has a collection of picturesque anecdotes to contribute: of\r\nheroic sacrifices for the sake of a little reading and writing; of young\r\ngirls stitching away their youth to keep a brother in college; of whole\r\nfamilies cheerfully starving together to save one gifted child from the\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nGo from the public school to the public library, from the library to\r\nthe social settlement, and you will carry away the same story in a\r\nhundred different forms. The good people behind the desks in these\r\npublic places are fond of repeating that they can hardly keep up with\r\nthe intellectual demands of their immigrant neighbors. In the experience\r\nof the librarians it is the veriest commonplace that the classics have\r\nthe greatest circulation in the immigrant quarters of the city; and\r\nthe most touching proof of reverence for learning often comes from the\r\nilliterate among the aliens. On the East Side of New York, \"Teacher\"\r\nis a being adored. Said a bedraggled Jewish mother to her little boy\r\nwho had affronted his teacher, \"Don't you know that teachers is holy?\"\r\nPerhaps these are the things the teachers have in mind when they speak\r\nwith a tremor of the immense reward of work in the public schools.\r\n\r\nThat way of speaking is the fashion among workers of all sorts in the\r\neducational institutions where foreigners attend in numbers. Get a\r\ngroup of settlement people swapping anecdotes about their immigrant\r\nneighbors, and there is apt to develop an epidemic of moist eyes. Out\r\nof the fullness of their knowledge these social missionaries pay the\r\ntribute of respect and affection to the strangers among whom they toil.\r\nFor they know them as we know our brothers and sisters, from living and\r\nworking and rejoicing and sorrowing together.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of everyday experience is borne out by the sudden\r\nrevelations of catastrophic circumstances, as reported by a librarian\r\nfrom Dayton, Ohio. In Dayton they had branch libraries located in\r\ndifferent parts of the city, not in separate library buildings, but\r\nin convenient shops or dwelling-houses, where they were left in the\r\ncare of some responsible person in the neighborhood. After the recent\r\nflood,(4) when the panic was over and the people began to dig for their\r\nbelongings underneath the accumulated slime and wreckage, the librarian\r\ntried to collect at the central library whatever was recovered of the\r\nscattered collection. Crumpled, mutilated, slimy with the filth of the\r\ndisemboweled city, the books came back--all but one collection, which\r\nhad been housed in the midst of the Hungarian quarter. These came back\r\nneatly packed, scraped clean of mud, their leaves smoothed, dried,--as\r\npresentable as loving care could make them.\r\n\r\n  (4) March, 1913.\r\n\r\nIf that was not a manifestation of pure idealism, then is human conduct\r\nvoid of symbolism, and our public squares are cumbered in vain with\r\nmonuments erected in commemoration of human deeds. But we read men's\r\nsouls in their actions, and we know that they who flock to the schools\r\nare the spiritual kindred of those who founded them; they who cherish\r\na book are passing along the torch kindled by him who wrote it. They\r\npay the highest tribute to an inventor who show the most eagerness to\r\nadopt his invention. The great New England invention of compulsory\r\neducation is more eagerly appropriated by the majority of our immigrants\r\nthan by native Americans of the corresponding level. That is what the\r\nschool-teachers say, and I suppose they know. They also say,--they and\r\nall public educators in chorus,--that while one foreign nationality\r\nexcels in the love of letters, another excels in the love of music, and\r\na third in the love of science; and all of them together constitute an\r\narmy whose feet keep time with the noble rhythms of culture.\r\n\r\nLet a New Yorker on Friday night watch the crowd pushing out of a\r\nconcert hall after one of Ysaye's recitals, and on Saturday afternoon\r\nlet him take the subway uptown, and get out where the crowd gets out,\r\nand buy a ticket for the baseball game. If he can keep cool enough for\r\na little study, let him compare the distorted faces in the bleachers\r\nwith the shining faces of the crowd of the night before; and let him\r\nsay which crowd responded to the nobler inspiration, and then let him\r\ndeclare in which group the foreigners outnumbered the Americans.\r\n\r\nThe American devotion to sport is no reproach to the descendants of the\r\nPuritans, since it can be demonstrated from various angles that the\r\nbaseball diamond may supplement the schoolroom and the pulpit in the\r\ntraining of American citizens. Indeed, it is not difficult to accept\r\nthat interpretation of the national sport which reduces a good game of\r\nbaseball to an epitome of all that is best in the lives of the best\r\nAmericans. At the same time we need to remember that the love of art\r\nis more generally accepted as a mark of grace than the love of sport.\r\nThus, when we speak of the glory of old Athens we have in mind not the\r\nOlympian games, noble as they were, but the poets and sculptors and\r\nphilosophers who uttered her thoughts. The original of the Discobolus\r\nmust have been a winner,--I can imagine Athenian mothers lifting up\r\ntheir beautiful bare babies to see the hero over the heads of the\r\nthrong,--but who can tell me his name to-day? Meanwhile the name of\r\nMyron has been guarded as a talisman of civilization.\r\n\r\nWe shall not look in the sporting columns, then, for the names of\r\ncontemporary Americans who are likely to secure us a place of honor\r\non the scrolls of history. We look under the current book reviews,\r\nin theatre programmes, in the announcements of art galleries. As\r\na by-product of such a search we announce the discovery that the\r\nprizefighters seem to be near cousins of certain Americans of turbulent\r\nnotoriety in politics, themselves derived from one of the approved\r\nimmigrant stocks of the \"old\" dispensation; while the singer and painter\r\nand writer folk very often hail from those parts of Europe at present\r\nlabeled \"undesirable\" as a source of immigration. Nay, is it not a good\r\njoke on the restrictionists that an American singer who aspires to be\r\na prima donna must trick herself out with a name borrowed from the\r\nsteerage lists of recent arrivals at Ellis Island?\r\n\r\nIf it is the scum of Europe that we are getting in our present\r\nimmigration, it seems to be a scum rich in pearls. Pearl-fishing, of\r\ncourse, is accompanied by labor and danger and expense, but it is\r\nreckoned a paying industry, or practical men would not invest their\r\ncapital in it. The brunt of the business falls on the divers, however.\r\nHave we divers willing to go down into our human sea and risk an\r\nencounter with sharks and grope in the ooze at the bottom? We have our\r\nschool teachers and librarians and social missionaries, whose zest\r\nfor their work should shame us out of counting the cost of our human\r\nfishery. As to the accumulations of empty shells, we are told that in\r\nthe pearl fisheries of South America about one oyster in a thousand\r\nyields a pearl; and yet the industry goes on.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of the oyster bank goes further still. We know that the\r\nnine hundred and ninety-nine empty shells have a lining, at least,\r\nof mother-of-pearl. We are thus encouraged to look for the generic\r\nopalescence of humanity in the undistinguished mass of our immigrants.\r\nWhat do the aliens show of the specific traits of manhood that go to\r\nthe making of good citizens? Immersed in the tide of American life, do\r\ntheir spiritual secretions give off that fine lustre of manhood that\r\ndistinguished the noble Pilgrims of the first immigration? The genius of\r\nthe few is obvious; the group virtue of the mass on exalted occasions,\r\nsuch as popular uprisings, has been sufficiently demonstrated. What\r\nwe want to know now is whether the ordinary immigrant under ordinary\r\ncircumstances comes anywhere near the type we have taken as a model.\r\n\r\nThere can be no effective comparison between the makers of history\r\nof a most romantic epoch and the venders of bananas on our own\r\nthrice-commonplace streets. But the Pilgrims were not always engaged\r\nin signing momentous compacts or in effecting a historic landing. In a\r\nsecondary capacity they were immigrants--strangers come to establish\r\nthemselves in a strange land--and as such they may profitably be used as\r\na model by which to measure other immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe historic merit of their enterprise aside, the virtue of the Pilgrim\r\nFathers was that they came not to despoil, but to build; that they\r\nresolutely turned their backs on conditions of life that galled them,\r\nand set out to make their own conditions in a strange and untried world,\r\nat great hazard to life and limb and fortune; that they asked no favors\r\nof God, but paid in advance for His miracles, by hewing and digging and\r\nploughing and fighting against odds; that they respected humankind,\r\nbelieved in themselves, and pushed the business of the moment as if the\r\nuniverse hung on the result.\r\n\r\nThe average immigrant of to-day, like the immigrant of 1620, comes to\r\nbuild--to build a civilized home under a civilized government, which\r\ndiminishes the amount of barbarity in the world. He, too, like that\r\nearlier newcomer, has rebelled against the conditions of his life,\r\nand adventured halfway across the world in search of more acceptable\r\nconditions, facing exile and uncertainty and the terrors of the untried.\r\nHe also pays as he goes along, and in very much the same coin as\r\ndid the Pilgrims; awaiting God's miracle of human happiness in the\r\ngrisly darkness of the mine, in the fierce glare of the prairie ranch,\r\nin the shrivelling heat of coke-ovens, beside roaring cotton-gins,\r\nbeside blinding silk-looms, in stifling tailor-shops, in nerve-racking\r\nengine-rooms,--in all those places where the assurance and pride of\r\nthe State come to rest upon the courage and patience of the individual\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nThere is enough of peril left in the adventure of emigration to mark him\r\nwho undertakes it as a man of some daring and resource. Has civilization\r\nsmoothed the sea, or have not steamships been known to founder as well\r\nas sailing vessels? Does not the modern immigrant also venture among\r\nstrangers, who know not his ways nor speak his tongue nor worship his\r\nGod? If his landing is not threatened by savages in ambush, he has\r\nto run the gauntlet of exacting laws that serve not his immediate\r\ninterests. The early New England farmer used to carry his rifle with him\r\nin the fields, to be ready for prowling Indians, and the gutter-merchant\r\nof New York to-day is obliged to carry about the whole armory of his\r\nwits, to avert the tomahawk of competition. No less cruel than Indian\r\nchiefs to their white captives is the greedy industrial boss to the\r\nlaborers whom poverty puts at his mercy; and how could you better match\r\nthe wolves and foxes that prowled about the forest clearings of our\r\nancestors than by the pack of sharpers and misinformers who infest the\r\nimmigrant quarters of our cities?\r\n\r\nMeasured by the exertions necessary to overcome them, the difficulties\r\nthat beset the modern immigrant are no less formidable than those\r\nwhich the Pilgrims had to face. There has never been a time when it\r\nwas more difficult to get something for nothing than it is to-day, but\r\nthe unromantic setting of modern enterprises leads us to underestimate\r\nthe moral qualities that make success possible to-day. Undoubtedly the\r\npioneer with an axe over his shoulder is a more picturesque figure\r\nthan the clerk with a pencil behind his ear, but we who have stood up\r\nagainst the shocks of modern life should know better than to confuse the\r\npicturesque with the heroic. Do we not know that it takes a _man_ to\r\nbeat circumstances, to-day as in the days of the pioneers? And manliness\r\nis always the same mixture of courage, self-reliance, perseverance, and\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nInventions have multiplied since the days of the Pilgrims, but which\r\nof our mechanical devices takes the place of the old-fashioned quality\r\nof determination where obstacles are to be overcome? The New England\r\nwilderness retreated not before the axe, but before the diligence\r\nof the men who wielded the axe; and diligence it is which to-day\r\ntransmutes the city's refuse into a loaf for the ragpicker's children.\r\nResourcefulness--the ability to adjust the means to the end--enters\r\nequally in the subtle enterprises of the business man and in the\r\nhardy exploits of the settler; and it takes as much patience to wait\r\nfor returns on a petty investment of capital as it does to watch the\r\nsprouting of an acre of corn.\r\n\r\nHardiness and muscle and physical courage were the seventeenth-century\r\nmanifestations of the same moral qualities which to-day are expressed\r\nas intensity and nerve and commercial daring. Our country being in part\r\ncultivated, in part savage, we need citizens with the endowment of the\r\ntwentieth century, and citizens with the pioneer endowment. The \"new\"\r\nimmigration, however interpreted, consists in the main of these two\r\ntypes. Whether we get these elements in the proportion best suited to\r\nour needs is another question, to be answered in its place. At this\r\npoint it is only necessary to admit that the immigrant possesses an\r\nabundance of the homely virtues of the useful citizen in times of peace.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at this conclusion by a theoretical analysis of the qualities\r\nthat carry a man through life to-day; and that was fair reasoning,\r\nsince the great majority of aliens are known to make good, if not in\r\nthe first generation, then in the second or the third. Any sociologist,\r\nany settlement worker, any census clerk will tell you that the history\r\nof the average immigrant family of the \"new\" period is represented by\r\nan ascending curve. The descending curves are furnished by degenerate\r\nfamilies of what was once prime American stock. I want no better\r\nproof of these facts than I find in the respective vocabularies of\r\nthe missionary in the slums of New York and the missionary in the New\r\nEngland hills. At the settlement on Eldridge Street they talk about\r\nhastening the process of Americanization of the immigrant; the country\r\nminister in the Berkshires talks about the rehabilitation of the Yankee\r\nfarmer. That is, the one assists at an upward process, the other seeks\r\nto reverse a downward process.\r\n\r\nRight here, in these opposite tendencies of the poor of the foreign\r\nquarters and the poor of the Yankee fastnesses, I read the most\r\nconvincing proof that what we get in the steerage is not the refuse, but\r\nthe sinew and bone of all the nations. If rural New England to-day shows\r\nsigns of degeneracy, it is because much of her sinew and bone departed\r\nfrom her long ago. Some of the best blood of New England answered to the\r\ncall of \"Westward ho!\" when the empty lands beyond the Alleghanies gaped\r\nfor population, while on the spent farms of the Puritan settlements too\r\nmany sons awaited the division of the father's property. Of those who\r\nwere left behind, many, of course, were detained by habit and sentiment,\r\nlove of the old home being stronger in them than the lure of adventure.\r\nOf the aristocracy of New England that portion stayed at home which\r\nwas fortified by wealth, and so did not feel the economic pressure of\r\nincreased population; of the proletariat remained, on the whole, the\r\nless robust, the less venturesome, the men and women of conservative\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nIt was bound to be so, because, wherever the population is set in\r\nmotion by internal pressure, the emigrant train is composed of the\r\nstoutest, the most resourceful of those who are not held back by the\r\nroots of wealth or sentiment. Voluntary emigration always calls for\r\nthe highest combination of the physical and moral virtues. The law of\r\nanalogy, therefore, might suffice to teach us that with every shipload\r\nof immigrants we get a fresh infusion of pioneer blood. But theory is\r\na tight-rope on which every monkey of a logician can balance himself.\r\nWe practical Americans of the twentieth century like to feel the broad\r\nplatform of tested facts beneath our feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUGH WORK AND LOW WAGES FOR THE IMMIGRANT]\r\n\r\nThe fact about the modern immigrant is that he is everywhere continuing\r\nthe work begun by our pioneer ancestors. So much we may learn from a\r\nbare recital of the occupations of aliens. They supply most of the\r\nanimal strength and primitive patience that are at the bottom of our\r\ncivilization. In California they gather the harvest, in Arizona they dig\r\nirrigation ditches, in Oregon they fell forests, in West Virginia they\r\ntunnel coal, in Massachusetts they plant the tedious crops suitable to\r\nan exhausted soil. In the cities they build subways and skyscrapers and\r\nrailroad terminals that are the wonder of the world. Wherever rough work\r\nand low wages go together, we have a job for the immigrant.\r\n\r\nThe prouder we grow, the more we lean on the immigrant. The Wall Street\r\nmagnate would be about as effective as a puppet were it not for the army\r\nof foreigners who execute his schemes. The magic of stocks and bonds\r\nlies in railroad ties and in quarried stone and in axle grease applied\r\nat the right time. A Harriman might sit till doomsday gibbering at the\r\ntelephone and the stock exchange would take no notice of him if a band\r\nof nameless \"Dagos\" a thousand miles away failed to repair a telegraph\r\npole. New York City is building an aqueduct that will surpass the works\r\nof the Romans, and the average New Yorker will know nothing about it\r\nuntil he reads in the newspapers the mayor's speech at the inauguration\r\nof the new water supply.\r\n\r\nOur brains, our wealth, our ambitions flow in channels dug by the hands\r\nof immigrants. Alien hands erect our offices, rivet our bridges, and\r\npile up the proud masonry of our monuments. Ignoring in this connection\r\nthe fact that the engineer as well as the laborer is often of alien\r\nrace, we owe to mere muscle a measure of recognition proportionate to\r\nour need of muscle in our boasted material progress. An imaginative\r\nschoolboy left to himself must presently catch the resemblance between\r\nthe pick-and-shovel men toiling at our aqueducts and the heroes of\r\nthe axe and rifle extolled in his textbooks as the \"sturdy pioneers.\"\r\nConsidered without prejudice, the chief difference between these two\r\ntypes is the difference between jean overalls and fringed buckskins.\r\nContemporaneousness takes the romance out of everything; otherwise we\r\nmight be rubbing elbows with heroes. Whatever merit there was in hewing\r\nand digging and hauling in the days of the first settlers still inheres\r\nin the same operations to-day. Yes, and a little extra; for a stick\r\nof dynamite is more dangerous to handle than a crowbar, and the steam\r\nengine makes more widows in a year than ever the Indian did with bloody\r\ntomahawk and stealthy arrow.\r\n\r\nThere is no contention here that every fellow who successfully passes\r\nthe entrance ordeals at Ellis Island is necessarily a hero. That there\r\nare weaklings in the train of the sturdy throng of foreigners nobody\r\nknows better than I. I have witnessed the pitiful struggles of the\r\nunfit, and have seen the failures drop all around me. But no bold army\r\never marched to the field of action without a fringe of camp-followers\r\non its flanks. The moral vortex created by the enterprises of the\r\nresolute sucks in a certain number of the weak-hearted; and this is\r\nespecially true in mass movements, where the enthusiasm of the crowd\r\nekes out the courage of the individual. If it is not too impious\r\nto suggest it, may there not have been among the passengers of the\r\nMayflower two or three or half a dozen who came over because their\r\ncousins did, not because they had any zest for the adventure?\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that the Pilgrim Fathers came with their families, we\r\nmay be very sure that that was the case, because the different members\r\nof a family are seldom of the same moral fibre. No doubt the austere\r\nambitions of the voyagers of the Mayflower made them stern recruiting\r\nmasters, but our knowledge of men in the mass forbids the assumption\r\nthat they were all heroes of the first rank who stepped ashore on\r\nPlymouth Rock.\r\n\r\n    I have little sympathy with declaimers about the Pilgrim Fathers,\r\n    who look upon them all as men of grand conceptions and superhuman\r\n    foresight. An entire ship's company of Columbuses is what the world\r\n    never saw.\r\n\r\nIt takes a wizard critic like Lowell to chip away the crust of historic\r\nsentiment and show us our forefathers in the flesh. Lowell would agree\r\nwith me that the Pilgrims were a picked troop in the sense that there\r\nwas an immense preponderance of virtue among them. And that is exactly\r\nwhat we must say of our modern immigrants, if we judge them by the sum\r\ntotal of their effect on our country.\r\n\r\nNot a little of the glory of the Pilgrim Fathers rests on their own\r\ntestimony. Our opinion of them is greatly enhanced by the expression we\r\nfind, in the public and private documents they have left us, of their\r\nideals, their aims, their expectations in the New World. Let us judge\r\nour immigrants also out of their own mouths, as future generations will\r\nbe sure to judge them. And in seeking this testimony let us remember\r\nthat humanity in general does not produce one oracle in a decade. Very\r\nfew men know their own hearts, or can give an account of the impulses\r\nthat drive them in a particular direction. We put our ears to the lips\r\nof the eloquent when we want to know what the world is thinking. And\r\nwhat do we get when we sift down the sayings of the spokesmen among\r\nthe foreign folk? An anthem in praise of American ideals, a passionate\r\nglorification of the principles of democracy.\r\n\r\nLet it be understood that the men and women of exceptional intellect,\r\nwho have surveyed the situation from philosophical heights, are not\r\ntrumpeting forth their own high dreams alone. If they have won the ear\r\nof the American nation and shamed the indifferent and silenced the\r\ncynical, it is because they voiced the feeling of the inarticulate mob\r\nthat welters in the foreign quarters of our cities. I am never so clear\r\nas to the basis of my faith in America as when I have been talking with\r\nthe ungroomed mothers of the East Side. A widow down on Division Street\r\nwas complaining bitterly of the hardships of her lot, alone in an alien\r\nworld with four children to bring up. In the midst of her complaints\r\nthe children came in from school. \"Well,\" said the hard-pressed widow,\r\n\"bread isn't easy to get in America, but the children can go to school,\r\nand that's more than bread. Rich man, poor man, it's all the same: the\r\nchildren can go to school.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor widow had never heard of a document called the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, but evidently she had discovered in American practice\r\nsomething corresponding to one of the great American principles,--the\r\nprinciple of equality of opportunity,--and she valued it more than the\r\nnecessaries of animal life. Even so was it valued by the Fathers of the\r\nRepublic, when they deliberately incurred the dangers of a war with\r\nmighty England in defense of that and similar principles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNGROOMED MOTHER OF THE EAST SIDE]\r\n\r\nThe widow's sentiment was finely echoed by another Russian immigrant,\r\na man who drives an ice-wagon for a living. His case is the more\r\nimpressive from the fact that he left a position of comparative opulence\r\nin the old country, under the protection of a wealthy uncle who employed\r\nhim as steward of his estates. He had had servants to wait on him and\r\nmoney enough to buy some of the privileges of citizenship which the\r\nRussian Government doles out to the favored few. \"But what good was\r\nit to me?\" he asked. \"My property was not my own if the police wanted\r\nto take it away. I could spend thousands to push my boy through the\r\nGymnasium, and he might get a little education as a favor, and still\r\nnothing out of it, if he isn't allowed to be anything. Here I work like\r\na slave, and my wife she works like a slave, too,--in the old country\r\nshe had servants in the house,--but what do I care, as long as I know\r\nwhat I earn I got it for my own? I got to furnish my house one chair at\r\na time, in America, but nobody can take it away from me, the little that\r\nI got. And it costs me nothing to educate my family. Maybe they can,\r\nmaybe they can't go to college, but all can go through grammar school,\r\nand high school, too, the smart ones. And all go together! Rich and\r\npoor, all are equal, and I don't get it as a favor.\"\r\n\r\nBetter a hard bed in the shelter of justice than a stuffed couch under\r\nthe black canopy of despotism. Better a crust of the bread of the\r\nintellect freely given him as his right than the whole loaf grudgingly\r\nhanded him as a favor. What nobler insistence on the rights of manhood\r\ndo we find in the writings of the Puritans?\r\n\r\nVolumes might be filled with the broken sayings of the humblest among\r\nthe immigrants which, translated into the sounding terms of the\r\nuniversal, would give us the precious documents of American history over\r\nagain. Never was the bread of freedom more keenly relished than it is\r\nto-day, by the very people of whom it is said that they covet only the\r\ngolden platter on which it is served up. We may not say that immigration\r\nto our country has ceased to be a quest of the ideal as long as the\r\nimmigrants lay so much stress on the spiritual accompaniment of economic\r\nelevation in America. Nobly built upon the dreams of the Fathers, the\r\nhouse of our Republic is nobly tenanted by those who cherish similar\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nBut dreams cannot be brought before a court of inquiry. A diligent\r\nimmigration commission with an appropriation to spend has little time to\r\nlisten to Joseph. A digest of its report is expected to yield statistics\r\nrather than rhapsodies. The taxpayers want their money's worth of hard\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nBut when the facts are raked together and boiled down to a summary that\r\nthe business man may scan on his way to the office, behold! we are\r\nno wiser than before. For a host of interpreters jump into the seats\r\nvacated by the extinct commission and harangue us in learned terms on\r\nthe merits and demerits of the immigrant, _as they conceive them_, after\r\nstudying the voluminous report. That is, the question is still what it\r\nwas before: a matter of personal opinion! The man with the vote realizes\r\nthat _he_ has to make up _his_ mind what instructions to send to his\r\nrepresentative in Congress on the subject of immigration. And where\r\nshall he, a plain, practical man, unaccustomed to interpret dreams or\r\nanalyze statistics, find an index of the alien's worth that he can read\r\nthrough the spectacles of common sense?\r\n\r\nThere is a phrase in the American vocabulary of approval that sums up\r\nour national ideal of manhood. That phrase is \"a self-made man.\" To\r\nsuch we pay the tribute of our highest admiration, justly regarding our\r\nself-made men as the noblest product of our democratic institutions.\r\nNow let any one compile a biographical dictionary of our self-made men,\r\nfrom the romantic age of our history down to the prosaic year 1914, and\r\nsee how the smell of the steerage pervades the volume! _There_ is a sign\r\nthat the practical man finds it easy to interpret. Like fruits grow\r\nfrom like seeds. Those who can produce under American conditions the\r\nindigenous type of manhood must be working with the same elements as the\r\nnative American who starts out a yokel and ends up a senator.\r\n\r\nFocused under the microscope of theoretical analysis, or viewed through\r\nthe spectacles of common sense, the average immigrant of to-day still\r\nshows the markings of virtue that have distinguished the best Americans\r\nfrom the time of the landing at Plymouth to the opening of the Panama\r\nCanal. But popular judgment is seldom based on a study of the norm,\r\nespecially in this age of the newspaper. The newspaper is devoted to the\r\nportrayal of the abnormal--the shining example and the horrible example;\r\nand most men think they have done justice when they have balanced the\r\none against the other, leaving out of account entirely the great mass\r\nthat lies between the two extremes. And even of the two extremes, it is\r\nthe horrible example that is more frequently brought to the attention\r\nof the public. Half a dozen Italians draw knives in a brawl on a given\r\nevening, and the morning newspapers are full of the story. On the\r\nsame evening hundreds of Italians were studying civics in the night\r\nschools, inquiring for classics at the public library, rehearsing for a\r\nhistorical pageant at the settlement--and not a word about them in the\r\nnewspapers. One Jewish gangster makes more \"copy\" than a hundred Jewish\r\nboys and girls who win honors in college. So also it is the business of\r\nthe police to record the fact that a Greek was arrested for peddling\r\nwithout a license, while it is nobody's business to report that a dozen\r\nother Greeks chipped in their spare change to pay his fine. The reader\r\nof newspapers is convinced that the foreigners as a whole are a violent,\r\nvicious, lawless crowd, and the fewer we have of them the better.\r\n\r\nCould the annual reports of libraries and settlements be circulated as\r\nwidely as the newspapers, the American public would not be guilty of\r\nsuch errors of judgment. But who reads annual reports? The very name\r\nof them is forbidding! It becomes necessary, therefore, to explain\r\nthe newspaper types that jump to the fore in every discussion of the\r\nimmigrant.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we must get a good grip on our sense of proportion. To\r\nspeak of the immigrants as undesirable because a few of them throw bombs\r\nor live by gambling is about as fair as it would be for the world to\r\ncall us Americans a nation of dissolute millionaires and industrial\r\npirates because a Harry Thaw drank himself into an insane asylum and a\r\nRockefeller swept a host of competitors to ruin.\r\n\r\nBut the bomb-thrower and the gambler are extremely undesirable. Look at\r\nthe Black Hand outrages, look at the Rosenthal case!\r\n\r\nAye, I have looked, and I see plainly that these horrible examples are\r\ndue to the same causes as any shining example that could be named. Each\r\nis the product of the qualities the immigrant brought with him and the\r\nopportunities he found here to exercise them. The law-abiding, ambitious\r\nimmigrant who came here a beggar and worked himself into the ranks\r\nof the princes found his opportunity in our laws and customs, which\r\nenable the common man to make the most of himself. The blackmailer's\r\nopportunity was provided by the operation of corrupt politics, which\r\nremoves police commissioners and impeaches governors for trying to\r\nenforce the law. The Rosenthal case brought forth Lieutenant Becker,\r\nand an investigation of the spread of the Black Hand terror discovers\r\npolitical bosses behind the scenes.(5) We have laws providing for the\r\ndeportation of alien criminals. Why are they not always enforced? When\r\nwe have found the broom that will sweep the political vermin from our\r\nlegislatures, we shan't need to look around for a shovel to keep back\r\nthe scum of Europe. The two will go together.\r\n\r\n  (5) See _The Outlook_, August 16, 1913; article by Frank Marshall\r\n  White.\r\n\r\nIn the whole catalogue of sins with which the modern immigrant is\r\ncharged, it is not easy to find one in which we Americans are not\r\npartners,--we who can make and unmake our world by means of the ballot.\r\nThe immigrant is blamed for the unsanitary conditions of the slums, when\r\nsanitary experts cry shame on our methods of municipal house-cleaning.\r\nYou might dump the whole of the East Side into the German capital and\r\nthere would be no slums there, because the municipal authorities of\r\nBerlin know how to enforce building regulations, how to plant trees, and\r\nhow to clean the streets. The very existence of the slum is laid at the\r\ndoor of the immigrant, but the truth is that the slums were here before\r\nthe immigrants. Most of the foreigners hate the slums, and all but the\r\nfew who have no backbone get out of them as fast as they rise in the\r\neconomic scale. To \"move uptown\" is the dearest ambition of the average\r\nimmigrant family.\r\n\r\nIf the slums were due to the influx of foreigners, why should London\r\nhave slums, and more hideous slums than New York? No, the slum is not\r\na by-product of the steerage. It is a sore on the social body in many\r\ncivilized countries, due to internal disorders of the economic system. A\r\ngenerous dose of social reformation would do more to effect a cure than\r\nrepeated doses of restriction of immigration.\r\n\r\nA whole group of phenomena due to social and economic causes have\r\nbeen falsely traced, in this country, to the quantity and quality of\r\nimmigration. Among these are the labor troubles, such as non-employment,\r\nstrikes, riots, etc. England has no such immigration as the United\r\nStates, and yet Englishmen suffer from non-employment, from riots and\r\nbitter strikes. Whom does the English workingman blame for his misery?\r\nLet the American workingman quarrel with the same enemy. If wage-cutting\r\nis a sin more justly laid at the door of the immigrant, a minimum wage\r\nlaw might put a stop to that.\r\n\r\nThe immigrant undoubtedly contributes to the congestion of population\r\nin the cities, but not as a chief cause. Congestion is characteristic\r\nof city life the world over, and the remedy will be found in improved\r\nconditions of country life. Moreover, the immigrant has shown himself\r\nresponsive to direction away from the city when a systematic attempt\r\nis made to help him find his place in the country. There is the\r\nexperience of the Industrial Removal Office of the Baron de Hirsch\r\nFoundation as a hint of what the Government might accomplish if it took\r\na hand in the intelligent distribution of immigration. The records\r\nof this organization, dealing with a group of immigrants supposed\r\nto be especially addicted to city life, kill two immigrant myths at\r\none stroke. They prove that it is possible to direct the stream of\r\nimmigration in desired channels and that the Jew is not altogether\r\naverse to contact with the soil; both facts contrary to popular notions.\r\n\r\nA good deal of anti-immigration feeling has been based on the vile\r\nconditions observed in labor camps, by another turn of that logic which\r\nputs the blame on the victims. A labor camp at its worst is not an\r\nargument against immigration, but an indictment of the brutality of the\r\ncontractor who cares only to force a maximum of work out of the workmen,\r\nand cares nothing for their lives; an indictment also of the Government\r\nthat allows such shameful exploitation of the laborers to go on. That\r\na labor camp does not have to be a plague spot has been gloriously\r\ndemonstrated by Goethals at Panama. What Goethals did was to emphasize\r\nthe _man_ in workingman, with the result that Panama during the vast\r\noperations of digging the Canal was a healthier, happier, more inspiring\r\nplace to live in than many of our proudest cities; the workmen came away\r\nfrom the job better men and better citizens; and the work was better\r\ndone and with more dispatch and at less expense than any such work was\r\never done by the old-fashioned method, where the workers are treated not\r\nas men but as tools.\r\n\r\nThere may not be another Goethals in the country, but what a great\r\nman devises little men may copy. The labor camp must never again be\r\nmentioned as a reproach to the immigrant who suffers degradation in it,\r\nor the world will think that we do not know the meaning of the medals\r\nwhich we ourselves have hung on Goethals's breast.\r\n\r\nImmigrants are accused of civic indifference if they do not become\r\nnaturalized, but when we look into the conditions affecting\r\nnaturalization we wonder at the numbers who do become citizens.\r\nFacilities for civic education of the adult are very scant,\r\nand dependent mostly on the fluctuating enthusiasm of private\r\nphilanthropies. The administration of the naturalization laws differs\r\nfrom State to State and is accompanied by serious material hindrances;\r\nwhile the community is so indifferent to the civic progress of its alien\r\nmembers that it is possible for a foreigner to live in this country\r\nfor _sixteen years_, coming in contact with all classes of Americans,\r\nwithout getting the bare information that he may become a citizen of\r\nthe United States if he wants to. Such a case, as reported by a charity\r\nworker of New Britain, Connecticut, makes a sensitive American choke\r\nwith mortification. If we were ourselves as patriotic as we expect the\r\nimmigrant to be, we would employ Salvation Army methods to draw the\r\nforeigner into the civic fold. Instead of that, we leave his citizenship\r\nto chance--or to the most corrupt political agencies.\r\n\r\nI would rather not review the blackest of all charges against the\r\nimmigrant, that he has a baleful effect on municipal politics: I am\r\nso ashamed of the implications. But sensible citizens will talk and\r\ntalk about the immigrant selling his vote, and not know whom they are\r\naccusing. Votes cannot be sold unless there is a market for them. Who\r\ncreates the market for votes? The ward politician, behind whom stands\r\nthe party boss, alert, and powerful; and behind him--the indifferent\r\nelectorate who allow him to flourish.\r\n\r\nAmong immigrants of the \"new\" order, the wholesale prostitution of\r\nthe ballot is confined to those groups which are largely subjected to\r\nthe industrial slavery of mining and manufacturing communities and\r\nconstruction camps. These helpless creatures, in their very act of\r\nsinning, bear twofold witness against us who accuse them. The foreman\r\nwho disposes of their solid vote acquires his power under an economic\r\nsystem which delivers them up, body and soul, to the man who pays them\r\nwages, and turns it to account under a political system which makes the\r\nlegislature subservient to the stock exchange. But let it be definitely\r\nnoted that to admit that groups of immigrants under economic control\r\nfall an easy prey to political corruptionists is very far from proving\r\nany inherent viciousness in the immigrants themselves.\r\n\r\nNeither does the immigrant's civic reputation depend entirely on\r\nnegative evidence. New York City has the largest foreign population\r\nin the United States, and precisely in that city the politicians\r\nhave learned that they cannot count on the foreign vote, because\r\nit is not for sale. A student of New York politics speaks of the\r\n\"uncontrollable and unapproachable vote of the Ghetto.\" Repeated\r\nanalyses of the election returns of the Eighth District, which has\r\nthe largest foreign population of all, show that \"politically it is\r\none of the most uncertain sections\" in the city. Many generations of\r\ncampaign managers have discovered to their sorrow that the usual party\r\nblandishments are wasted on the East Side masses. Hester Street follows\r\nleaders and causes rather than party emblems. Nowhere is the art of\r\nsplitting a ticket better understood. The only time you can predict the\r\nEast Side vote is when there is a sharp alignment of the better citizens\r\nagainst the boss-ridden. Then you will find the naturalized citizens in\r\nthe same camp with men like Jacob Riis and women like Lillian Wald. And\r\nthe experience of New York is duplicated in Chicago and in Philadelphia\r\nand in every center of immigration. Ask the reformers.\r\n\r\nHow often we demand more civic virtue of the stranger than we ourselves\r\npossess! A little more time spent in weeding our own garden will relieve\r\nus of the necessity of counting the tin cans in the immigrant's back\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nAs to tin cans, the immigrants are not the only ones who scatter\r\nthem broadcast. How can we talk about the foreigners defacing public\r\nproperty, when our own bill-boards disfigure every open space that God\r\ntries to make beautiful for us? It is true that the East Side crowds\r\nlitter the parks with papers and fruit-skins and peanut shells, but they\r\nwould not be able to do so if the park regulations were persistently\r\nenforced. And in the mean time the East Side children, in their pageants\r\nand dance festivals, make the most beautiful use of the parks that a\r\npoet could desire.\r\n\r\nThere exists a society in the United States the object of which is to\r\nprotect the natural beauties and historical landmarks of our country.\r\nWho are the marauders who have called such a society into being? Who is\r\nit that threatens to demolish the Palisades and drain off Niagara? Who\r\nare the vulgar folk who scrawl their initials on trees and monuments,\r\nwho chip off bits from historic tombstones, who profane the holy echoes\r\nof the mountains by calling foolish phrases through a megaphone? The\r\nofficers of the Scenic and Historic Preservation Society are not\r\nwatching Ellis Island. On the contrary, it was the son of an immigrant\r\nwhose expert testimony, given before a legislative committee at Albany,\r\nhelped the Society to save the Falls of the Genesee from devastation by\r\na power company. This same immigrant's son, on another occasion, spent\r\ntwo mortal hours tearing off visiting-cards from a poet's grave--cards\r\nbearing the names of American vacationists.\r\n\r\nSome of the things we say against the immigrants sound very strange from\r\nAmerican lips. We speak of the corruption of our children's manners\r\nthrough contact with immigrant children in the public schools, when\r\nall the world is scolding us for our children's rude deportment. Finer\r\nmanners are grown on a tiny farm in Italy than in the roaring subways of\r\nNew York; and contrast our lunch-counter manners with the table-manners\r\nof the Polish ghetto, where bread must not be touched with unwashed\r\nhands, where a pause for prayer begins and ends each meal, and on\r\nfestival occasions parents and children join in folk-songs between\r\ncourses!\r\n\r\nIf there is a corruption of manners, it may be that it works in the\r\nopposite direction from what we suppose. At any rate, we ourselves admit\r\nthat the children of foreigners, before they are Americanized, have a\r\ngreater respect than our children for the Fifth Commandment.\r\n\r\nWe say that immigrants nowadays come only to exploit our country,\r\nbecause some of them go back after a few years, taking their savings\r\nwith them. The real exploiters of our country's wealth are not the\r\nforeign laborers, but the capitalists who pay them wages. The laborer\r\nwho returns home with his savings leaves us an equivalent in the\r\nproducts of labor; a day's service rendered for every day's wages.\r\nThe capitalists take away our forests and water-courses and mineral\r\ntreasures and give us watered stock in return.\r\n\r\nOf the class of aliens who do not come to make their homes here, but\r\nonly to earn a few hundred dollars to invest in a farm or a cottage\r\nin their native village, a greater number than we imagine are brought\r\nover by industrial agents in violation of the contract labor law. Put\r\nan end to the stimulation of immigration, and we shall see very few of\r\nthe class who do not come to stay. And even as it is, not all of those\r\nwho return to Europe do so in order to spend their American fortune.\r\nSome go back to recover from ruin encountered at the hands of American\r\nland swindlers. Some go back to be buried beside their fathers, having\r\nlost their health in unsanitary American factories. And some are helped\r\naboard on crutches, having lost a limb in a mine explosion that could\r\nhave been prevented. When we watch the procession of cripples hobbling\r\nback to their native villages, it looks more as if America is exploiting\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nO that the American people would learn where their enemies lurk! Not\r\nthe immigrant is ruining our country, but the venal politicians who try\r\nto make the immigrant the scapegoat for all the sins of untrammeled\r\ncapitalism--these and their masters. Find me the agent who obstructs the\r\nmovement for the abolition of child labor, and I will show you who it\r\nis that condemns able-bodied men to eat their hearts out in idleness;\r\nwho brutalizes our mothers and tortures tender babies; who fills the\r\nmorgues with the emaciated bodies of young girls, and the infirmaries\r\nwith little white cots; who fastens the shame of illiteracy on our\r\nenlightened land, and causes American boys to grow up too ignorant to\r\nmark a ballot; who sucks the blood of the nation, fattens on its brains,\r\nand throws its heart to the wolves of the money market.\r\n\r\nThe stench of the slums is nothing to the stench of the child-labor\r\niniquity. If the foreigners are taking the bread out of the mouth of\r\nthe American workingman, it is by the maimed fingers of their fainting\r\nlittle ones.\r\n\r\nAnd if we want to know whether the immigrant parents are the promoters\r\nor the victims of the child labor system, we turn to the cotton mills,\r\nwhere forty thousand native American children between seven and sixteen\r\nyears of age toil between ten and twelve hours a day, while the fathers\r\nrot in the degradation of idleness.\r\n\r\nFrom all this does it follow that we should let down the bars and\r\ndispense with the guard at Ellis Island? Only in so far as the policy\r\nof restriction is based on the theory that the present immigration is\r\nderived from the scum of humanity. But the immigrants may be desirable\r\nand immigration undesirable. We sometimes have to deny ourselves to the\r\nmost congenial friends who knock at our door. At this point, however,\r\nwe are not trying to answer the question whether immigration is good\r\nfor us. We are concerned only with the reputation of the immigrant--and\r\nincidentally with the reputation of those who have sought to degrade\r\nhim in our eyes. If statecraft bids us lock the gate, and our national\r\ncode of ethics ratifies the order, lock it we must, but we need not call\r\nnames through the keyhole.\r\n\r\nMount guard in the name of the Republic if the health of the Republic\r\nrequires it, but let no such order be issued until her statesmen and\r\nphilosophers and patriots have consulted together. Above all, let the\r\nvoice of prejudice be stilled, let not self-interest chew the cud\r\nof envy in full sight of the nation, and let no syllable of willful\r\ndefamation mar the oracles of state. For those who are excluded when our\r\nbars are down are exiles from Egypt, whose feet stumble in the desert\r\nof political and social slavery, whose hearts hunger for the bread of\r\nfreedom. The ghost of the Mayflower pilots every immigrant ship, and\r\nEllis Island is another name for Plymouth Rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIERY FURNACE\r\n\r\nNebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, . . . Now if ye be ready that\r\nat what time ye hear the sound of the cornet . . . ye fall down and\r\nworship the image that I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye\r\nshall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace;\r\nand who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?\r\n\r\nShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O,\r\nNebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it\r\nbe so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning\r\nfiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if\r\nnot, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor\r\nworship the golden image which thou hast set up.\r\n\r\nDan. iii, 14-18.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of the third question,--whether immigration is good\r\nfor us,--more honest Americans have gone astray than in the other two\r\ndivisions. Let it be said at the outset that those who have erred have\r\nbeen about equally distributed between the ayes and the nays. For the\r\nanswer to this question is neither aye nor nay, but something that\r\ncannot be put into a single syllable. If we steer our way cautiously\r\nbetween the opposing ranks, the light of the true answer will presently\r\nshine on us.\r\n\r\nThe arguments they severally advance in defense of their respective\r\npositions reveal an appalling number of citizens on each side of the\r\nhouse who have entirely disregarded the principles involved. Those\r\nwho, like the labor-union lobbyists, point to the empty dinner-pails\r\nof American workingmen as a reason for keeping out foreign labor, are\r\nno more at fault than the lobbyists of the opposite side, who offer in\r\nsupport of the open-door policy statistics showing the need of rough\r\nlaborers in various branches of our current material development. All of\r\nthem are wrong in that they would treat our foreign brothers as pawns\r\non the chessboard of our selfish needs. Show me a million American\r\nworkingmen out of work, and I fail to see a justification for the\r\nexclusion of a million men from other lands who are also looking for a\r\njob. Does the mother of an impoverished family strangle half her brood\r\nin order that the other half may have enough to eat? No; she divides the\r\nlast crust equally among her starvelings, and the laws of nature do the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThis analogy, of course, is a vessel without a bottom unless the gospel\r\nof the brotherhood of man is accepted as a premise of our debate. The\r\nonly logic it will hold is the logic of a practical incarnation of\r\nthe theories we loudly applaud on occasions of patriotic excitement.\r\nThat ought to be acceptable both to the poor men who like to parade\r\nthe streets with the Stars and Stripes at the head of the column and\r\nthe _Marseillaise_ on their lips, and to the rich men who subscribe\r\ngenerously to soldiers' and sailors' monument funds, and who ransack\r\nancient chronicles to establish their connection with the heroes of the\r\nRevolution. Let the paraders and the ancestor-worshipers unite in a\r\npractical recognition of the rights of their belated brothers who are\r\nseeking to enter the kingdom of liberty and justice, and they will have\r\ngiven a living shape to the sentiment they symbolically honor, each in\r\nhis own way.\r\n\r\nI am not content if the labor leaders retire from the lobby when all the\r\nmills are running full time and shop foremen are scouring the streets\r\nfor \"hands.\" It is no proof of our sincerity that we are indifferent in\r\ntimes of plenty as to who it is that picks up the crumbs after we have\r\nfed. They only are true Americans who, remembering that this country was\r\nwrested from the English in the name of the common rights of humanity,\r\nresist the temptation to insure their own soup-kettles by patrolling the\r\nnational pastures and granaries against the hungry from other lands.\r\nShare and share alike is the motto of brotherhood.\r\n\r\nBut who will venture to preach such devotion to principle to the starved\r\nand naked and oppressed? Why, I, even I, who refuse to believe that the\r\nAmerican workingman is past answering the call of a difficult ideal,\r\nno matter what privations are gnawing at his vitals. I have read in\r\nthe history books that when Lincoln issued his call for volunteers,\r\nthey came from mills and factories and little shops as promptly as from\r\ncounting-rooms and college halls. Fathers of large families that looked\r\nto him for bread kissed their babies and marched off to the war, taking\r\nan elder son or two with them. Were they all aristocrats whose names\r\nare preserved on four thousand gravestones at Gettysburg? And who were\r\nthey who went barefoot in the snow and starved with Washington in Valley\r\nForge? The common people, most of them, the toilers for daily bread,\r\nthey who give all when they give aught, because they have not enough to\r\ndivide.\r\n\r\nThey only mark themselves as calumniators of the poor who protest that\r\ntimes and men have changed since Washington's and Lincoln's day; who\r\nthink that the breed of heroes died out with the passing of the Yankee\r\nfarmer and the provincial townsman of the earlier periods. Shall not the\r\ntestimony of a daughter of the slums be heard when the poor are being\r\njudged? I was reared in a tenement district of a New England metropolis,\r\nwhere the poor of many nations contended with each other for a scant\r\nliving; and the only reason I am no longer of the slums is because a\r\nhundred heroes and heroines among my neighbors fought for my release.\r\nNot only the members of my family, but mere acquaintances put their\r\nlittle all at my disposal. Merely that a dreamer among them might come\r\nto the fulfillment of her dream, they fed and sheltered and nursed me\r\nand cheered me on, again and again facing the wolves of want for my\r\nsake, giving me the whole cloak if the half did not suffice to save the\r\nspark of life in my puny body.\r\n\r\nIf my knowledge of the slums counts for anything, it counts for a\r\npositive assurance that the personal devotion which is daily manifested\r\nin the life of the tenements in repeated acts of self-denial, from the\r\nsharing of a delicacy with a sick neighbor to the education of a gifted\r\nchild by the year-long sacrifices of the entire family, is a spark from\r\nthe smouldering embers of idealism that lie buried in the ashes of\r\nsordid existence, and await but the fanning of a great purpose to leap\r\nup into a flame of abstract devotion.\r\n\r\nTimes have changed, indeed, since the days of Washington. His was a time\r\nof beginnings, ours is a time ripe for accomplishment. And yet the seed\r\nthe Fathers sowed we shall not reap, unless we consecrate ourselves to\r\nour purpose as they did,--all of us, the whole people, no man presuming\r\nto insult his neighbor by exempting him on account of apparent weakness.\r\nThe common people in Washington's time, and again in Lincoln's time,\r\nstood up like men, because they were called as men, not as weaklings who\r\nmust be coddled and spared the shock of robust moral enterprise. Not a\r\nfull belly but a brimming soul made heroes out of ploughboys in '76.\r\nThe common man of to-day is capable of a like transformation if pricked\r\nwith the electric needle of a lofty appeal. Those who are teaching\r\nthe American workingman to demand the protection of his job against\r\nlegitimate alien competition are trampling out the embers of popular\r\nidealism, instead of fanning it into a blaze that should transfigure the\r\nlife of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRESH INFUSION OF PIONEER BLOOD]\r\n\r\nIdealism of the finest, heroism unsurpassed, are frequently displayed in\r\nthe familiar episodes of the class war that is going on before our eyes,\r\nunder unionistic leadership. But it is a narrowing of the vision that\r\nmakes a great mass of the people adopt as the unit of human salvation\r\nthe class instead of the nation. The struggle which has for its object\r\nthe putting of the rapacious rich in their place does not constitute a\r\nfull programme of national progress. If labor leaders think they are\r\nleading in a holy war, they should be the last to encourage disrespect\r\nof the principles of righteousness for which they are fighting. It\r\nis inconsistent, to put it mildly, to lead a demonstration against\r\nentrenched capital on one day, and the next day to head a delegation in\r\nCongress in favor of entrenched labor. Is there anything brotherly about\r\na monopolization of the labor market? Substituting the selfishness of\r\nthe poor for the selfishness of the rich will bring us no nearer the day\r\nof universal justice.\r\n\r\nThough I should not hesitate to insist on a generous attitude toward\r\nthe foreigner even if it imposed on our own people all the hardships\r\nwhich are alleged to be the result of immigration, I do not disdain to\r\npoint out the fact that, when all is said and done, there is enough of\r\nAmerica to go around for many a year to come. It is hard to know whether\r\nto take the restrictionists seriously when they tell us that the country\r\nis becoming overcrowded. The population of the United States is less\r\nthan three times that of England, and England is only a dot on our map.\r\nIn Texas alone there is room for the population of the whole world, with\r\na homestead of half an acre for every family of five, and a patch the\r\nsize of Maryland left over for a public park. A schoolboy's geography\r\nwill supply the figures for this pretty sum.\r\n\r\nThe over-supply of labor is another myth of the restrictionist\r\nimagination that vanishes at one glance around the country, which\r\nshows us crops spoiling for want of harvesters, and women running to\r\nthe legislature for permission to extend their legal working-day in\r\nthe fields; such is the scarcity of men. Said ex-Secretary Nagel,\r\ncommenting upon the immigration bill which was so strenuously pushed by\r\nthe restrictionists in the Sixty-third Congress, only to be vetoed by\r\nPresident Taft:--\r\n\r\n    In my judgment no sufficiently earnest and intelligent effort has\r\n    been made to bring our wants and our supply together, and so far\r\n    the same forces that give the chief support to this provision of\r\n    the new bill [a literacy test, intended to check the influx of\r\n    cheap labor] have stubbornly resisted any effort looking to an\r\n    intelligent distribution of new immigration to meet the needs of our\r\n    vast country. [And] no such drastic measure [as the literacy test]\r\n    should be adopted until we have at least exhausted the possibilities\r\n    of a rational distribution of these new forces.\r\n\r\nDistribution--geographical, seasonal, occupational; that should be our\r\nnext watch-word, if we are bent on applying our vast resources to our\r\nneeds. It cannot be too often pointed out that a nation of our political\r\nconfession is bound to try every other possible solution of her problems\r\nbefore resorting to a measure that encroaches on the rights of humanity.\r\nAnd so far are we from exhausting the possibilities of internal reform\r\nthat even the most obvious economic errors have not been corrected.\r\nIt is not good sense nor good morals to keep men at work twelve and\r\nthirteen hours a day, seven days in the week, as they do, for example,\r\nin the paper-mills. It is bad policy to use women in the mills; it is\r\nheinous to use the children. Every one of those over-long jobs should\r\nbe cut in two; the women should be sent back to the nursery, and the\r\nchildren put to school, and able-bodied men set in their places.\r\n\r\nIf such a programme, consistently carried out throughout the country,\r\nstill left considerable numbers unemployed, there is one more remedy\r\nwe might apply. We might chain to the benches in the city parks, where\r\ninvoluntary idlers now pass the day, all the agents and runners who move\r\naround Europe at the expense of steamship companies, labor contractors,\r\nand mill-owners. We must _stop_ the importation of labor, not talk about\r\nstopping it.\r\n\r\nTo refrain from soliciting immigration is a very different thing from\r\nimposing an arbitrary check on voluntary immigration, and gives very\r\ndifferent results. The class of men who are lured across the ocean by\r\nthe golden promises of labor agents are not of the same moral order as\r\nthose who are spurred to the great adventure by a desire to share in our\r\nAmerican civilization. When we restrain the runners, we rid ourselves\r\nautomatically of the least desirable element of immigration,--the\r\nhordes of irresponsible job-hunters without family who do not ask to\r\nbe steered into the current of American life, and whose mission here\r\nis accomplished when they have saved up a petty fortune with which\r\nto dazzle the eyes of peasant sweethearts at home. It is this class\r\nthat contributes, through its ignorance and aloofness, the bulk of the\r\ndeplorable phenomena which are quoted by restrictionists as arguments\r\nagainst immigration in general. But we must go after them by the direct\r\nmethod, applying the force of the law to the agents who rout them out of\r\ntheir native villages. When we attempt to weed out this one element by\r\nindirect methods, such as the oft-proposed literacy test, we are guilty\r\nof the folly of discharging a cannon into the midst of the sheepfold\r\nwith the object of killing the wolf.\r\n\r\nIf through such a measure as the literacy test the desired results\r\ncould be insured, we should still be loath to adopt it until every\r\nother possible method had been tried. To hit at labor competition\r\nthrough a pretended fear of illiteracy is a tricky policy, and trickery\r\nis incompatible with the moral dignity of the American nation. Are\r\nwe bankrupt in statesmanship that we must pawn the jewel of national\r\nrighteousness? It required no small amount of ingenuity to find a\r\nconnection between the immigrant's ability to earn a wage and his\r\ninability to read. If the resourceful gentlemen who invented the\r\nliteracy test would concentrate their talents on the problem of stopping\r\nthe stimulation of immigration, we should soon hear the last of the\r\nover-supply of cheap labor. Where there's a will there's a way, in\r\nstatecraft as in other things.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough for the integrity of our principles to scrutinize the\r\nethical nature of proposed legislation. It must be understood in general\r\nthat whoever asks for restrictive measures as a means of improving\r\nAmerican labor conditions must prove beyond a doubt, first, that the\r\nevils complained of are not the result of our own sins, and next,\r\nthat the foreign laborer on coming to America has not exchanged worse\r\nconditions for better. The gospel of brotherhood will not let us define\r\nour own good in terms of indifference to the good of others.\r\n\r\nPreaching selfishness in the name of the American workingman is an\r\ninsidious way of shutting him out from participation in the national\r\nmission. If it is good for the nation to live up to its highest\r\ntraditions, it cannot be bad for any part of the nation to contribute\r\nits share toward the furtherance of the common ideal. For we are not\r\na nation of high and low, where the aristocracy acts and the populace\r\napplauds. If America is going to do anything in the world, every man and\r\nwoman among us will have a share in it.\r\n\r\nObjection to the influx of foreign labor is sometimes based on a\r\ntheory the very opposite of the scarcity of work. Some say that there\r\nis altogether too much work being done in this country--that we are\r\ndeveloping our natural resources and multiplying industries at a rate\r\ntoo rapid for wholesome growth; and to check this feverish activity it\r\nis proposed to cut off the supply of labor which makes it possible.\r\n\r\nI doubt, in the first place, if it is reasonable to expect a young\r\nnation with half a continent to explore to restrain its activity, as\r\nlong as there are herculean tasks in sight, any more than we would\r\nexpect a boy to walk off the diamond in the middle of the game. Or if it\r\nis thought best to slacken the speed of material progress, the brakes\r\nshould be applied at Wall Street, not at Ellis Island. The foreign\r\nlaborer is merely the tool in the hands of the promoter, indispensable\r\nto, but not responsible for, his activities. The workmen come in _after_\r\nthe promoter has launched his scheme. At least, I have never heard\r\nof a development company or industrial corporation organized for the\r\npurpose of providing jobs for a shipload of immigrants. That species of\r\nphilanthropy our benevolent millionaires have not hit on as yet.\r\n\r\nIt is because the brutal method is the easiest that we are advised to\r\nconfiscate the tools of industry in order to check the rate of material\r\ndevelopment. The more dignified way would be to restrain the captains of\r\nindustry, by asserting our authority over our own citizens in matters\r\naffecting the welfare of the nation. An up-to-date mother, desiring\r\nthat her little boy should not play with the scissors, would be ashamed\r\nto put them on a high shelf: she would train the boy not to touch them\r\nthough they lay within his reach. Why should the assemblage of mothers\r\nand fathers who constitute the nation show less pride about their\r\nmethods than a lone woman in the nursery?\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside the economic field, fear of the immigrant is perhaps oftenest\r\nexpressed in the sociological anxiety concerning assimilation. The\r\nquestion is raised whether so many different races, products of a great\r\nvariety of physical and moral environments, can possibly fuse into a\r\nharmonious nation, obedient to one law, devoted to one flag. Some people\r\nsee no indication of the future in the fact that race-blending has been\r\ngoing on here from the beginning of our history, because the elements we\r\nnow get are said to differ from us more radically than the elements we\r\nassimilated in the past.\r\n\r\nTo allay our anxiety on this point, we have only to remind ourselves\r\nthat none of the great nations of Europe that present such a homogeneous\r\nfront to-day arose from a single stock; and the differences between\r\npeoples in the times of the political beginnings of Europe were vastly\r\ngreater than the differences between East and West, North and South,\r\nto-day. Moreover, the European nations were assorted at the point of\r\nthe sword, while in America the nations are coming together of their\r\nown free will; and who can doubt that the spiritual forces of common\r\neducation, common interests and associations are more effective welding\r\nagents than brute force?\r\n\r\nDoubts as to the assimilative qualities of current immigration do\r\nnot exist in the minds of the workers in settlements, libraries, and\r\nschools. These people have a faith in the future of the strangers that\r\nis based on long and intimate experience with foreigners from many\r\nlands. When they are dealing with the normal product of immigration, the\r\npeople who come here following some dim star of higher destiny for their\r\nchildren, the social missionaries are jubilantly sure of the result; and\r\nface to face with the less promising material of the labor camps, where\r\nthousands are brought together by the lure of the dollar and are kept\r\ntogether by the devices of economic exploitation, the missionaries are\r\nstill undaunted. They have discovered that sanitation is a remedy for\r\nthe filth of the camp; that a spelling-book will make inroads on the\r\nignorance of the mob; that a lecture hall will diminish the business\r\nof the saloon and the brothel; that substituting neighborly kindness\r\nfor brutal neglect will fan to a glow the divine spark in the coarsest\r\nnatures. And then there is the Goethals way of managing a labor camp.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for the moral indigestion which unchecked immigration is said\r\nto induce is in enlarging the organs of digestion. More evening classes,\r\nmore civic centers, more missionaries in the field, and above all more\r\nneighborly interest on the part of the whole people. If immigration\r\nwere a green apple that we might take or leave, we might choose between\r\nletting the apple alone or eating it and following it up with a dose of\r\nour favorite household remedy. But immigration consists of masses of our\r\nfellow men moving upon our country in pursuit of their share of human\r\nhappiness. Where human rights are involved, we have no choice. We have\r\nto eat this green apple,--the Law of the Fathers enjoins it on us,--but\r\nwe have only ourselves to blame if we suffer from colic afterwards,\r\nknowing the sure remedy.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of resources, material or spiritual, for carrying out\r\nour half of the assimilation programme. We have money enough, brains\r\nenough, inspiration enough. The only reason the mill is grinding so\r\nslowly is that the miller is overworked and the hopper is choked. We\r\nare letting a few do the work we should all be helping in. At the\r\nsettlements, devoted young men and women are struggling with classes\r\nthat are too large, or turning away scores of eager children, and their\r\nfathers and mothers, too, because there are not enough helpers; and\r\nbetween classes they spend their energies in running down subscribers,\r\ngetting up exhibitions to entice the rich men of the community to come\r\nand have a look at their mission and drop something in the plate.\r\n\r\nBut why should there be a shortage of helpers at the settlement? Have\r\nnot the rich men sons and daughters, as well as check-books? What are\r\nthose young people doing, dancing the nights away in ballrooms and\r\nroof-gardens, season after season, year after year? They should be\r\ndown on their knees washing the feet of the pilgrims to the shrine of\r\nliberty, binding up the wounds of the victims of European despotism,\r\nteaching their little foreign brothers and sisters the first steps of\r\ncivilized life.\r\n\r\nIs it preposterous to ask that those who have leisure and wealth should\r\ngive of these stores when they are needed in the chief enterprise of\r\nthe nation? In what does patriotism consist if not in helping our\r\ncountry succeed in her particular mission? Our mission--the elevation\r\nof humanity--is one in which every citizen should have a share, or he\r\nis not an American citizen in the spiritual sense. The poor must give\r\nof their little--the workingman must not seek to monopolize the labor\r\nmarket; and the rich must give of their plenty--their time, their\r\nculture, their wealth.\r\n\r\nCertain texts in the restrictionist teachings are as insulting to our\r\nwell-to-do citizens as is the labor-monopoly preachment to the classes\r\nwho struggle for a living. The one assumes that the American workingman\r\nputs his family before his country; the other--the cry that we cannot\r\nassimilate so many strangers--implies that the country's reservoirs of\r\nwealth and learning and unspent energy are monopolized by the well-to-do\r\nfor their own selfish uses. We know what schools and lectures and\r\nneighborhood activities can do to promote assimilation. We cannot fail\r\nif we multiply these agencies as fast as the social workers call for\r\nthem. The means for such extension of service are in the hands of the\r\nrich. Whoever doubts our ability to assimilate immigration doubts the\r\ndevotion of our favored classes to the country's cause.\r\n\r\nUpon the rich and the poor alike rests the burden of the fulfillment\r\nof the dream of the Fathers, and they are poor patriots who seek to\r\nlift that burden from our shoulders instead of teaching us how to bear\r\nit nobly. Fresh from the press, there lies on my table, as I write, a\r\nreview of an important work on immigration, in which the reviewer refers\r\nto the \"sincere idealists who still cling to the superstition that it is\r\nopposition to some predestined divine purpose to suggest the rejection\r\nof the 'poor and oppressed.'\" It is just such teaching as that, which\r\ndiscards as so much sentimental junk the ideas that made our great men\r\ngreat, that is pushing us inch by inch into the quagmire of materialism.\r\nIf it is true that our rich care for nothing but their ease, and our\r\npoor have no thought beyond their daily needs, it is due to the fact\r\nthat the canker of selfishness is gnawing at the heart of the nation.\r\nThe love of self, absorption in the immediate moment, are vices of the\r\nflesh which fastened on us during the centuries of our agonized struggle\r\nfor brute survival. The remedy that God appointed for these evils, the\r\nvision of our insignificant selves as a part of a great whole, whose\r\nlifetime is commensurate with eternity, the materialists would shatter\r\nand throw on the dump of human illusions.\r\n\r\nWho talks of superstition in a world built on superstition? Civilization\r\nis the triumph of one superstition after another. At the very foundation\r\nof our world is the huge superstition of the Fatherhood of God. In a\r\ntime when the peoples of the earth bowed down to gods of stone, gods of\r\nwood, gods of brass and of gold, what more incomprehensible superstition\r\ncould have been invented than that of an invisible, omnipresent Creator\r\nwho made and ruled and disciplined the entire universe? One nation\r\nventured to adopt this superstition, and that nation is regarded as the\r\nliberator of humanity from the slavery of bestial ignorance. Out of that\r\ninitial superstition followed, in logical sequence, the superstition of\r\nthe Brotherhood of Man, spread abroad by a son of the venturesome race;\r\nsucceeded by a refinement of the same notion, the idea that the Father\r\nhas no favorite children, but allots to each an equal portion of the\r\ngoods of His house. That is democracy, the latest superstition of them\r\nall, the cornerstone of our Republic, and the model after which all the\r\nnations are striving to pattern themselves.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSide by side in our public schools sit the children of many races, ours\r\nand others. Week by week, month by month, year by year, the teachers\r\npick out the brightest pupils and fasten the medals of honor on their\r\nbreasts; and a startling discovery brings a cry to their lips: the\r\nchildren of the foreigners outclass our own! They who begin handicapped,\r\nand labor against obstacles, leave our own children far behind on the\r\nroad to scholarly achievement. In the business world the same strange\r\nphenomenon is observed: conditions of life and work that would prostrate\r\nour own boys and girls, these others use as a block from which to vault\r\nto the back of prancing Fortune. In private enterprises or public, in\r\npractical or visionary movements, these outsiders exhibit an intensity\r\nof purpose, a passion of devotion that do not mark the normal progress\r\nof our own well-cared-for children.\r\n\r\nWhat is the galvanizing force that impels these stranger children to\r\novermaster circumstances and bestride the top of the world? Is there\r\na special virtue in their blood that enables them to sweep over our\r\ncountry and take what they want? It is a special virtue, yes: the virtue\r\nof great purpose. The fathers and mothers of these children have not\r\nweaned them from the habit of contemplating a Vision. They teach them\r\nthat, in pursuit of the Vision, bleeding feet do not count. They tell\r\nthem that many morrows will roll out of the lap of to-day, and they must\r\nprepare themselves for a long and arduous march.\r\n\r\nThat is the reading of the riddle, and if we do not want to be shamed by\r\nthe newcomers in our midst, we must silence those sophisticated teachers\r\nof the people who ridicule or pass over with a smile the idea that we,\r\nas a nation, are in pursuit of a Vision, and that those things are good\r\nfor us which further our quest, and the rest--even to bleeding feet--do\r\nnot count with us. It is the obliteration of the Vision that causes the\r\nemptiness in the lives of our children which they are driven to fill\r\nup with tinsel pleasures and meaningless activities of all sorts. The\r\nbest blood in the world is in their veins,--the blood of heroes and\r\nmartyrs, of dreamers and doers,--filtered through less than half a dozen\r\ngenerations. If they do not arise and do great deeds all around us,\r\nit is because their noble blood is clogged in their veins through the\r\ninfiltrations of materialism in the teachings of the day.\r\n\r\nFor such an inconsequential whim as that men should be free to pray\r\nin any way they choose, the Pilgrim Fathers betook themselves to a\r\nwilderness peopled with savages, preferring to die by the tomahawk\r\nrather than submit to clerical authority. The free admission of\r\nimmigrants is not half so rash an adventure, and the thing to be gained\r\nby it is a more obvious good than that of freedom of worship. Even\r\na child can understand that it is better for human beings, be they\r\nRussians or Italians or Greeks, to get into a country where there is\r\nenough to eat and enough to wear, where nobody is permitted to abuse\r\nanybody else, and where story-books are given away, than it is to\r\nlive in countries where starvation and cruel treatment is the lot of\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\nNo man worthy of the name will deny that moral paralysis is a worse\r\nevil than congestion of the labor market, and moral paralysis creeps\r\non us whenever we throw down the burden of duty to recline in the lap\r\nof comfort. We shall see no prodigies in the ranks of our children\r\nas long as we are ruled by the calculating commercial spirit which\r\ntakes nothing on faith, which spurns as impracticable whatever is not\r\neasily negotiable, and repudiates our debt to the past as something\r\ntoo fantastic for serious consideration. Before the present era of\r\nprosperity set in, a scoffer who would brand as superstition the\r\nideas for which our forefathers died would not have spoken with the\r\nexpectation of being applauded, as he does to-day. Worldly things, like\r\ncomfort, position, security, and what is called success, have absorbed\r\nour attention to such a degree that some of us have forgotten that there\r\nis any good save the good of the flesh. Possessions have crowded out\r\naspirations, the applause of the world has become more necessary than\r\nthe inner satisfactions, and the whole horizon of life is filled with\r\nthe glaring bulk of an overwhelming prosperity.\r\n\r\nNo wonder a prophet like Edward Everett Hale was moved to pray before\r\nhis assembled congregation, \"Deliver us, O Lord! from our terrible\r\nprosperity.\" He saw what the worship of fleshly good did to our\r\nchildren: how it stripped from them the wings of higher ambition, and\r\nshackled their feet, that should be marching on to the conquest of\r\nspiritual worlds, with the weight of false successes. \"Deliver us, O\r\nLord! from our terrible prosperity,\" that our children may have burdens\r\nto lift, that they may learn to clutch at things afar, and their sight\r\ngrow strong with gazing after visions. \"Deliver us, O Lord! from our\r\nterrible prosperity,\" that simplicity of life may strip from us all\r\nsophistication, till we learn to honor the dreamers in our midst, and\r\nour prophets have a place in the councils of the nation.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot the good of the flesh, but that of the spirit is the good we seek.\r\nIf it is good for the soul of this nation that we should walk in the\r\ndifficult path our Fathers trod, harkening only to the inner voice,\r\nnever pausing to hear the counsels of cold prudence, then assuredly it\r\nis good for us to lift up the burdens of welcoming and caring for our\r\nbrothers from other lands, thus putting into fuller use the instrument\r\nof democracy the Fathers invented,--our Republic, founded to promote\r\nliberty and justice among men.\r\n\r\nOr if we despise the omens, refuse to take up the difficult task where\r\nour predecessors left off, what awaits us? If we persist in pampering\r\nourselves as favorite children, and bedeck ourselves with prosperity's\r\ncoat of many colors, how long will it be before the less favored\r\nbrethren, covetous of our superabundance, will strip us and sell us\r\ninto the bondage of decadence? Immigration on a large scale into every\r\ncountry as thinly populated as ours must go on, will go on, as long as\r\nthere are other countries with denser populations and scantier resources\r\nfor sustaining them. Right through history, the needy peoples have gone\r\nin and taken possession of the fat lands of their neighbors. Formerly\r\nthese invasions were effected by force; nowadays they are largely\r\neffected by treaties, laws, international understandings. But always\r\nthe tide flows from the lands of want to the lands of plenty. Nature\r\nis behind this movement; man has no power to check it permanently. We\r\nin America may, if we choose, shut ourselves up in the midst of our\r\nplenty and gorge till we are suffocated, but that will only postpone\r\nthe day of a fair division of our country's riches. We shall grow inert\r\nfrom fullness, drunk with the wine of prosperity, and presently some\r\nculminating folly, such as every degenerate nation sooner or later\r\ncommits, will leave us at the mercy of the first comers, and our spoils\r\nwill be divided among the watchers outside our gates.\r\n\r\nThese things will not happen in a day, nor in a generation, nor in a\r\ncentury, but have we no care for the days that will follow ours? When\r\nwe talk about providing for to-morrow, let us, in the name of all the\r\nwisdom that science has so laboriously amassed, think of that distant\r\nto-morrow when the things we now do will have passed into history, to\r\nstand for the children of that time either as a glorious example or a\r\nfearful warning. If we settle the immigration question selfishly, we\r\nshall surely pay the penalty for selfishness. And the rod will smite\r\nnot our own shoulders, but the shoulders of countless innocents of our\r\nbegetting.\r\n\r\nThe law that the hungry shall feed where there is plenty is not the only\r\none which we defy when we turn away the strangers now at our gates.\r\nA narrow immigration policy is in opposition also to a primary law\r\nof evolution, the law of continuous development along a given line\r\nuntil a climax is reached. Now the evolution of society has been from\r\nsmall isolated groups to larger intermingling ones. In the beginning\r\nof political history, every city was a world unto itself, and labored\r\nat its own salvation behind fortified walls that shut out the rest of\r\nthe world. Presently cities were merged into states, states united into\r\nconfederacies, confederacies into empires. Peoples at first unknown\r\nto each other even by name came to pass in and out of each other's\r\nterritories, merging their interests, their cultures, their bloods.\r\n\r\nThis process of the removal of barriers, begun through conquests,\r\ncommerce, and travels, is approaching completion in our own era, through\r\nthe influences of science and invention. \"The world is my country\" is a\r\nword in many a mouth to-day. East and West hold hands; North and South\r\nsalute each other. There remain a few ancient prejudices to overcome, a\r\nfew stumps of ignorance to uproot, before all the nations of the earth\r\nshall forget their boundaries, and move about the surface of the earth\r\nas congenial guests at a public feast.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, will be the proof of the ancient saying, \"He hath made\r\nof one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the\r\nearth.\" It is coming, inevitably it is coming. We in America are in a\r\nposition to hasten the climax of the drama of unification. If, instead\r\nof hastening it, we seek to delay it, we step aside from the path of the\r\nworld's progress.\r\n\r\nAmerica is not God's last stand. That which is to be is conditioned by\r\nwhat has been. Sometime, somewhere, the Plan that the centuries have\r\nbrooded over will come perfect out of the shell of Time. I am not afraid\r\nthat humanity will stop short of its inevitable climax, but I am so\r\njealous for the glory of my country that I long to have America retain\r\nthe leadership which she has held so nobly for a while. I desire that\r\nthe mantle of the New England prophets should rest on the shoulders of\r\nour own children.\r\n\r\nOf the many convincing arguments that have been advanced in support of\r\nthe proposition that immigration is good for us, I shall quote only one,\r\nin the words of Grace Abbott, of Chicago, when she sums up a study of\r\neleven immigrant nationalities from southern and eastern Europe. \"It\r\nwas the faith in America and not the occasional criticism that touched\r\nme most,\" she writes, referring to the sayings of the foreigners. \"I\r\nfelt then, as I have felt many times when I have met some newcomer\r\nwho has expected a literal fulfillment of our democratic ideals, that\r\nfortunately for America we had great numbers who were coming to remind\r\nus of the 'promise of American life,' and insisting that it should not\r\nbe forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the arguments--utilitarian, humanitarian, and\r\nscientific--I willingly omit. For I do not want the immigrant to be\r\nadmitted because he can help us dig ditches and build cities and fight\r\nour battles in general. I beg that we make this a question of principle\r\nfirst, and of utility afterwards. Whether immigration is good for us or\r\nnot, I am very certain that the decadence of idealism is bad for us, and\r\nthat is what I fear more than the restrictionist fears the immigrant.\r\n\r\nIt should strengthen us in our resolution to abide by the Law of the\r\nFathers--the law of each for all, and all for each--if we find that the\r\nmovement of democracy to which they imparted such a powerful impulse\r\nappears to be in the direct path of social evolution. But even if\r\nsuch omens were lacking I should still pray for strength to cling to\r\nthe ideal which is defined in the opening words of the Declaration\r\nof Independence. For I perceive that here, in the trial at Ellis\r\nIsland, we are put to the test of the fiery furnace. It was easy to\r\npreach democracy when the privileges we claimed for ourselves no alien\r\nhordes sought to divide with us. But to-day, when humanity asks us\r\nto render up again that which we took from the English in the name\r\nof humanity, do we dare to stand by our confession of faith? Those\r\nwho honor the golden images of self-interest and materialism threaten\r\nus with fearful penalties in case we persist in our championship of\r\nuniversal brotherhood. They are binding our hands and feet with the\r\nbonds of selfish human fears. The fiery glow of the furnace is on our\r\nfaces--and the world holds its breath.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce the thunders of God were heard on Mount Sinai, and a certain people\r\nheard, and the blackness of idolatry was lifted from the world. Again\r\nthe voice of God, the Father, shook the air above Bunker Hill, and the\r\ngrip of despotism was loosened from the throat of panting humanity.\r\n\r\nLet the children of the later saviors of the world be as faithful as the\r\nchildren of the earlier saviors, and perhaps God will speak again in\r\ntimes to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Riverside Press\r\n  CAMBRIDGE .
