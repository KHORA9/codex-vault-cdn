Perhaps the\r\nBritish officer to whom he made this statement was startled to have him\r\nspeak of the colonies as free. Yet at the time the American people were\r\nthe freest in the world, freer even than the people of England. It was\r\nto defend this freedom, not to gain new rights, that the colonists\r\nrebelled against Great Britain. For decades they had been governing\r\nthemselves, so when the British Ministry tried to govern them from\r\nLondon, they would not submit.\r\n\r\nTo understand what was in the minds and hearts of George Washington,\r\nSamuel Adams, Patrick Henry, and the other patriots, it is necessary to\r\nknow how the colonies became self-governing. One must follow the\r\npolitical battles and hard-earned victories of their fathers, and\r\ngrandfathers, and great-grandfathers in the colonial Assemblies.\r\n\r\nThis volume treats of the struggle for self-government in Virginia from\r\nthe founding of Jamestown in 1607 to the Declaration of Independence.\r\nThe story of the gradual lessening of the King's prerogative, of the\r\nweakening of the power of the Governor, of the emergence of the Assembly\r\nas the ruling body could be paralleled in other colonies. But it is of\r\nespecial importance in Virginia, where was held the first representative\r\nAssembly in the New World, and which gave so many leaders to the\r\nAmerican Revolution.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my appreciation to my Alma Mater, the University of\r\nVirginia, for its award of a Thomas Jefferson Research Fellowship,\r\nwithout which this volume would not have been written.\r\n\r\n                                                THOMAS J.

Two decades earlier Sir Walter Raleigh had sent out a group of\r\nsettlers to what is now North Carolina, and they had disappeared\r\nmysteriously. What had happened to them? men asked. Had they been killed\r\nby the Indians? Had they fallen victims to disease? Had they starved?\r\nThose who shared in this new venture must have wondered if a like fate\r\nawaited them in this strange new land.\r\n\r\nBut their spirits rose when they entered Chesapeake Bay. Landing parties\r\nwere delighted with the \"fair meddowes ... full of flowers of divers\r\nkinds and colors,\" the \"goodly tall trees,\" and the streams of fresh\r\nwater. It was a smiling country which seemed to bid them welcome. But\r\nwhen they entered the mouth of a broad river, which they called the\r\nJames in honor of their King, and made their way up into the country,\r\nnew doubts must have assailed them. They knew that savages lived in the\r\ndense forests which lined both banks; might not strange wild beasts live\r\nthere also? Might there not be fatal diseases unknown in Europe?\r\n\r\nPossibly they wondered what type of government Englishmen would live\r\nunder here. In the charter granted the Virginia Company of London in\r\n1606 it was promised that they should \"enjoy all the liberties,\r\nfranchises, and immunities\" of Englishmen, \"as if they had been abiding\"\r\nin England. Even without this promise they would have taken it for\r\ngranted that they were not surrendering the freedom derived from their\r\nancestors. This was the view taken six decades later by Francis Moryson\r\nand Thomas Ludwell, agents for the colony. If the King planted a colony\r\nof Englishmen, they and their heirs ought by law to enjoy the \"same\r\nliberties and privileges as Englishmen in England.\" After all, the\r\ncolony would be but \"an extension or dilation of the realm of\r\nEngland.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe men who came to Virginia had, in the mother country, participated in\r\nthe government through representatives of their own choosing, so they\r\ninsisted upon this right in their new home. They claimed, also, the\r\nhabeas corpus, jury trial, and freedom from taxation save by their own\r\nconsent. In England not even the King could take a man's money legally\r\nuntil it had been granted by the House of Commons. Upon this recognized\r\nprinciple English liberty was chiefly based; upon its acceptance in\r\nAmerica depended the future of liberty there.\r\n\r\nYet when the first band of settlers stepped ashore at Jamestown, liberty\r\nin England still hung in the balance. At the conclusion of the Wars of\r\nthe Roses the King was almost absolute. The people were desperately\r\ntired of anarchy; they were tired also of the oppressions of the barons.\r\nSo long as the King put an end to both they had no desire to limit his\r\npower. The Commons ate out of his hand. Henry VIII might tear the Church\r\nfrom the Roman see, Mary might restore it, Edward might once more break\r\nwith Rome--in each case the people submitted. Those who dared resist\r\nfaced the headsman's block or the pyre.\r\n\r\nBut in time the memory of the Wars of the Roses grew dim. And the growth\r\nof the artisan class, the development of trade, the birth of a great\r\nliterature, the work of the universities, the expansion of world\r\nhorizons fired the imagination and awakened men to their own\r\npotentialities. Self-government is a tender plant which withers in the\r\nsoil of poverty and ignorance, and it was the advance of prosperity and\r\nenlightenment under the Tudors which made possible the flowering of\r\nliberty under the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nJames I had been on the throne only three years when the little town\r\nwhich bore his name was founded. James has been called the wisest fool\r\nin Christendom; but he was neither wise nor a fool. His conception of\r\nthe King's office was logical and simple. It was his function to rule;\r\nthe duty of the people was to obey. If they did not, like bad children\r\nthey should be scolded and perhaps punished, since it was not only\r\nillegal but wicked to question the King's authority. \"As to dispute what\r\nGod may do is blasphemy, so it is sedition in subjects to dispute what a\r\nKing may do,\" he said. Parliament he considered a nuisance. \"I am\r\nsurprised that my ancestors should have permitted such an institution to\r\ncome into existence,\" he said. \"I am a stranger and found it here when\r\nI arrived, so that I am obliged to put up with what I cannot get rid\r\nof.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons were not inclined to accept the King's theory of\r\nthe relations between himself and Parliament. When James told them that\r\nthey had no privileges save by royal grace, they replied that he had\r\nbeen misinformed. When in answer to James' demand that they refrain from\r\nmeddling in foreign affairs, they entered on their journal a\r\nprotestation of their right of free speech, he was so enraged that he\r\nsent for the book and with his own hands tore out the page.\r\n\r\nThe Commons considered it a precious privilege to be \"governed by\r\ncertain rules of law ... and not by uncertain or arbitrary form of\r\ngovernment.\" There is a general fear among the people, they told James,\r\nthat royal proclamations might eventually assume the nature of laws.\r\nThen their ancient freedom would be abridged, \"if not quite taken away,\"\r\nand \"a new form of arbitrary government\" brought on the realm.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between King and Parliament foreshadowed the conflict\r\nbetween the Governors and the people of the colonies. The provincial\r\nAssemblies were not less determined to resist any infringement on their\r\nrights than was Parliament. And the fortunes of the contending forces in\r\nthe mother country affected profoundly those in the colonies. Echoes of\r\nthe First Stuart Despotism, the Civil War and Commonwealth, the\r\nRestoration, the Second Stuart Despotism, the Glorious Revolution, the\r\nlaissez-faire period, and the reaction under George III reverberated in\r\nthe colonies.\r\n\r\nBut the development of self-government in America was by no means\r\nentirely dependent upon events in England. There were forces in the New\r\nWorld which favored democracy. The wide spaces of the frontier made men\r\nself-reliant and resourceful and impatient of control by a distant\r\nmonarch, ever ready to defend old rights, quick to demand new ones.\r\n\"People remote from the seat of government are always remarkable for\r\ntheir disobedience,\" wrote Governor Gooch, in 1732.[3] As the historian\r\nFoote has pointed out, they and \"their children were republicans; in\r\nEngland they would have been styled rebels.\"\r\n\r\nThe creating of a vast middle class in the colonies also tended toward\r\ndemocracy. The men who turned their backs on the homes of their\r\nancestors to start life over again in the tobacco fields of Virginia\r\nwere, most of them, desperately poor. Many came under terms of\r\nindenture. But they had, prior to the introduction of slaves in large\r\nnumbers, every opportunity to rise. As a result there emerged a\r\nvigorous, intelligent, freedom-loving yeomanry, who had a profound\r\ninfluence in winning self-government.\r\n\r\nBut the victory at first seemed to be with the King. When James granted\r\na charter to the Virginia Company of London, he took care that it should\r\ninclude no provision for representative government. Instead he kept the\r\ncontrol of the proposed colony in his own hands. There was to be a\r\nCouncil resident in England appointed by him and responsible to him.\r\nThis body was to name another Council which was to reside in Virginia\r\nand administer the \"Articles, Instructions, and Orders\" which the King\r\ndrew up with his own hand. In practice this body assumed administrative,\r\nlegislative, and judicial powers, and ruled the infant colony by their\r\nown arbitrary will.[4]\r\n\r\nNot only was this constitution undemocratic, but it proved inefficient.\r\nHad the Council in England made better selections for the Council in\r\nVirginia, the colony would have been saved much disorder and suffering.\r\nBut never was there a more quarrelsome set of men. The fleet had been at\r\nsea but a few days when Captain John Smith was accused of plotting to\r\noverthrow the government and murder his associates, and was kept in\r\nprison below decks. Only some weeks after the landing at Jamestown was\r\nhe released and permitted to take his seat on the Council.[5]\r\n\r\nOn the Council with him were Captain Christopher Newport, Edward\r\nWingfield, Bartholomew Gosnold, George Kendall, John Ratcliffe, and John\r\nMartin. One would think that this little group, set down in the\r\nwilderness and faced with many perils, would have occupied their time\r\nbetter than with plotting against each other. They had enough to do to\r\ndefend themselves against the Indians, for in a sudden attack four of\r\nthem were wounded and another had a narrow escape when an arrow passed\r\nthrough his beard.[6]\r\n\r\nKendall was the first to be expelled from the Council. Gosnold died.\r\nWingfield, who was President of the Council, was accused of being an\r\natheist, of plotting to desert the colony, and of misappropriating\r\npublic funds, and was ousted from his seat. Since Newport had sailed\r\nwith the fleet for England, Ratcliffe, Smith, and Martin were now the\r\nonly remaining Councillors. But this did not bring harmony. Kendall was\r\naccused of plotting against the other two, tried, and hanged. Smith,\r\ntoo, was in danger of the gallows, when he was held responsible for the\r\ndeath of two men who had been killed by the Indians. Were the \"whipping,\r\nlawing, beating, and hanging in Virginia known in England, I fear it\r\nwould drive many well affected minds from this honorable action,\"\r\nWingfield stated after his return to England. With the drowning of two\r\nnew Councillors, Captain John Smith alone remained, and for several\r\nmonths was the sole ruler of the colony.[7]\r\n\r\nWhen word of what was going on in Virginia reached the London Company it\r\nwas obvious to all that the original plan of government had proved a\r\nfailure. So they secured a new charter empowering them to change it. But\r\nfor a remedy they turned, not to self-government, but to despotism. They\r\nabolished the old Council, and turned the colony over to a Governor who,\r\nwithin the limits of his instructions, was to \"rule and govern by his\r\nown discretion or by such laws\" as he should decree. To assist him he\r\nwas to choose an advisory Council.\r\n\r\nThe danger of this system was at first obscured by the wise choice of a\r\nGovernor. Thomas Lord De la Warr was a man of distinction and ability.\r\nHe had studied at the Queen's College, Oxford, had served with Essex in\r\nIreland, and had been a member of the Privy Council under both Elizabeth\r\nand James.[8]\r\n\r\nUpon landing at Jamestown, De la Warr listened to a sermon by the good\r\nminister, Mr. Buck. He then addressed the people, \"laying some blames on\r\nthem,\" and promising, if forced to it, to draw the sword of justice. But\r\nthere seems to have been no need for this. The people, forgetting former\r\nquarrels, were united in their efforts to serve their Governor and bring\r\na degree of prosperity to the colony. The sound of hammering and sawing\r\nwas heard on all sides as little houses were built, the fort repaired,\r\nthe church restored. \"Every Sunday, when the Lord Governor went to\r\nchurch, he was accompanied by all the Councillors, Captains, and other\r\nofficers, and all the gentlemen, and with a band of fifty halberdiers in\r\nhis Lordships livery, fair red cloaks, on each side and behind him. The\r\nLord Governor sat in the choir in a green velvet chair, with a velvet\r\ncushion before him on which he knelt.\"[9]\r\n\r\nBut that Lord De la Warr proved to be a mild and just Governor by no\r\nmeans obscures the evils inherent in absolutism. A good ruler may be\r\nsucceeded by a bad one. In ancient Rome the people benefited by the\r\nestablishing of law and order under the great Augustus, but they\r\nsuffered from the cruelty of the insane Caligula and the dissolute Nero.\r\nSo it boded no good for Virginia when De la Warr fell ill. \"I was\r\nwelcomed by a hot and violent ague,\" he tells us. This was followed by\r\nan attack of dysentery. \"Then the cramp assaulted my weak body with\r\nstrong pains, and afterward the gout.\" Finally scurvy came to add to his\r\nwoes, so that he \"was upon the point to leave this world.\" In\r\ndesperation he set sail for the West Indies in the hope of recovering\r\nhis health.[10]\r\n\r\nA few weeks after De la Warr's departure Sir Thomas Gates assumed\r\ncommand of the colony. In 1614 he, in turn, was followed by Sir Thomas\r\nDale, Dale by Captain George Yeardley, and Yeardley by Samuel Argall.\r\nWhen Gates was in Virginia in 1610 he had brought with him certain laws,\r\norders, and instructions which he posted in the church at Jamestown. As\r\nthe people crowded into the little building to read them they must have\r\nexpressed their resentment and horror, for the laws were more suited to\r\na penal colony than to a community of free Englishmen. In 1611 Dale\r\nbrought additional laws, and the whole body was revised in England and\r\npublished. Gates and Dale had both served with the English army in the\r\nNetherlands, and these laws were \"chiefly extracted out of the laws for\r\ngoverning the army\" there.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that \"every man and woman daily twice a day upon the\r\nfirst tolling of the bell shall upon the working days repair into the\r\nchurch to hear divine service upon pain of losing his or her day's\r\nallowance for the first omission, for the second to be whipped, for the\r\nthird to be condemned to the galleys for six months.\" Equally severe was\r\nthe law that \"no man shall give any disgraceful words or commit any act\r\nto the disgrace of any person ... upon pain of being tied head and feet\r\ntogether upon the guard every night for the space of one month.\" To kill\r\nany cattle, or horse, goat, or pig, or chicken without leave was\r\npunishable with death. No doubt conducive to health but not to liberty\r\nwas the order that no man or woman should wash linen or pots and pans\r\n\"within twenty foot of the old well ... upon pain of whipping.\"[11]\r\n\r\nDe la Warr was a humane man, who thought that order could be maintained\r\nwithout cruelty. Gates, also, seems not to have enforced the severe\r\nlaws. But the situation changed when Dale, and after him Argall assumed\r\npower. These two men were guilty of reigns of terror that would have\r\nshamed an Ivan the Terrible or a Hitler. The Virginia Assembly of 1624\r\ntestified that the colony suffered \"under most severe and cruel laws\r\nsent over in print,\" contrary to the King's promise. And these laws were\r\n\"mercilessly executed, often times without trial or judgment.\" Some who\r\nsought relief by fleeing to the Indians were captured and executed,\r\neither by hanging, or shooting, or even by being broken on the wheel.\r\nOne man who had stolen some oatmeal had a knife thrust through his\r\ntongue, and then was tied to a tree where he was left to starve. In 1612\r\nseveral men tried to steal a barge and a shallop in order to risk their\r\nlives in a desperate attempt to reach England. For this they were \"shot\r\nto death, hanged and broken upon the wheel.\"[12]\r\n\r\nBut better things were in store. Many of the leading spirits of the\r\nLondon Company, who \"stood best affected to religion and liberty\" were\r\n\"distasted with the proceedings of the Court.\" This group began now to\r\ndream of migrating to Virginia to set up a government there which would\r\nbe sympathetic with their views. \"Many worthy patriots, lords, knights,\r\ngentlemen, merchants, and others ... laid hold on ... Virginia as a\r\nprovidence cast before them.\"[13] Had not the Pilgrim fathers shown the\r\nway to New England a few years later, it might have been in Virginia\r\nrather than in Massachusetts that the Bible commonwealth was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nProminent among the liberal faction in the Company was Sir Edwin Sandys.\r\nIn his youth he had studied at Corpus Christi, Oxford, under Richard\r\nHooker, the future founder of Connecticut, and this ardent Puritan\r\ninfluenced profoundly his views and career. It was from Hooker that he\r\ngot the theory that the King derived his authority from a contract with\r\nthe people, and not by divine right. Later, when as a member of the\r\nCommons he enunciated this theory, he drew down on his head James'\r\nbitter hatred. Sandys, who had long been a member of the Council of the\r\nLondon Company, was elected to the important post of Treasurer in 1617.\r\nTo prevent his re-election three years later, the King sent the names of\r\nfour other men to the Company with the demand that they elect one of\r\nthem. When the Company sent a delegation to him to protest against this\r\ninterference with their affairs, James blurted out: \"Choose the devil if\r\nyou will, but not Sir Edwin Sandys.\"\r\n\r\nSandys seems to have planned to secure successive charters, each\r\ngranting the Company greater powers than its predecessor, under the\r\npretext that this was necessary for the success of the enterprise. The\r\nsecond charter, granted in 1609, is of especial importance because by it\r\nthe King resigned the immediate control of the colony into the hands of\r\nthe Company. The charter of 1612 still further strengthened their hands.\r\n\r\nBut the Sandys faction met strenuous opposition in the Company itself.\r\nMany of the stockholders thought it a mistake to involve the Company in\r\nthe political and religious struggle which was convulsing the nation. At\r\ntimes the Quarter Courts resounded with the angry debates of the\r\ncontending parties. A momentous struggle it was, since upon the outcome\r\ndepended the establishing of self-government in America. So there was\r\nrejoicing among the liberal party when Sandys was victorious.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Sandys drew up with his own hand what has been\r\ncalled the Magna Carta of Virginia in the fall of 1617, granting the\r\ncolony the right to representative government. Lord De la Warr, who was\r\nstill the Governor, had expected to leave at that time with this famous\r\ndocument. But his sailing was delayed until April, 1618. Unfortunately\r\nDe la Warr, who probably had never fully recovered his health, became\r\nill during the voyage and died.\r\n\r\nWhen news of De la Warr's death reached the London Company, they chose\r\nCaptain George Yeardley to be his successor. In January, 1619, Yeardley\r\nsailed from England with several documents, probably duplicates of the\r\nMagna Carta, authorizing him to hold an election for a General\r\nAssembly.[14] His instructions have been preserved, but his commission,\r\nor constitution for the colony, has been lost. Yet undoubtedly it was\r\nsimilar to, if not identical with the Magna Carta of 1617, and with the\r\n\"Ordinance and Constitution\" of July 24, 1621, given Sir Francis Wyatt.\r\n\r\nThis constitution called for a Council to be chosen from time to time by\r\nthe Company to assist the Governor in maintaining the \"people in justice\r\nand Christian conversation amongst themselves, and in strength and\r\nability to withstand their enemies.\" Another body \"to be called by the\r\nGovernor once yearly and no oftener but for very extraordinary and\r\nimportant occasions, shall consist for the present of the said Council\r\nof State, and two Burgesses out of every town, hundred, or other\r\nparticular plantation, to be respectively chosen by the inhabitants.\"\r\nThis body, which was called the General Assembly, was to \"have free\r\npower to treat, consult, and conclude, as well of all emergent occasions\r\nconcerning the public weal of the said colony ... as also to make,\r\nordain, and enact such general laws and orders ... as shall from time to\r\ntime appear necessary.\" To the Governor was reserved a negative voice.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Assembly were directed \"to imitate and follow the form\r\nof government, laws, customs, and manner of trial, and other\r\nministration of justice used in the realm of England.\" And a limit was\r\nput to the authority of the Assembly by a provision that no law should\r\n\"continue in force\" unless ratified by the Company. But a degree of\r\nindependence was granted in the instruction that \"after the government\r\nof the said colony shall once have been framed ... no orders of court\r\nafterwards shall bind the said colony, unless they be ratified in like\r\nmanner in the General Assemblies.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThere must have been rejoicing in Virginia when Yeardley arrived with\r\norders \"for the better establishing a commonwealth.\" Perhaps there were\r\ncheers, perhaps tears of joy in the crowd which assembled in Jamestown\r\nto listen to his proclamation. It promised that those cruel laws by\r\nwhich they had so long been governed were now abrogated, and that they\r\nwere to be governed by those free laws which his Majesty's subjects in\r\nEngland lived under.[16]\r\n\r\nOn August 9, 1619, the first representative assembly in American\r\nhistory met in the crude little church at Jamestown. When Governor\r\nYeardley had taken his seat in the choir, the members of the Council sat\r\nbeside him, some on one side, some on the other. \"But forasmuch as men's\r\naffairs do little prosper when God's service is neglected, all the\r\nBurgesses took their places in the choir till a prayer was said by Mr.\r\nBuck, the minister.\" Then the Burgesses were called in order by name,\r\nand so every man took the oath of supremacy.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly assumed from the first that it was to be the Parliament of\r\nVirginia. But they realized that they must make no laws which\r\ncontravened those of England, or the charter, or the instructions of the\r\nLondon Company. During the first session, acts were passed concerning\r\nthe Church, Indian affairs, land patents, morality, prices, trade, etc.\r\nBut by far the most important law was one ordering \"that every man and\r\nman servant above sixteen years of age shall pay into the hands and\r\ncustody of the Burgesses ... one pound of the best tobacco.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe control of taxation by the representatives of the people was to play\r\na vital role in the development of self-government in America. It was\r\nbased on the fact, universally recognized by Englishmen, that no power\r\nhad the right to take a man's property without his own consent. A\r\ncentury after the first session of the Virginia Assembly the New York\r\nAssembly reminded Governor Robert Hunter that their inherent right \"to\r\ndispose of the money of the freemen\" did \"not proceed from any\r\ncommission, letters patent, or other grant from the Crown, but from the\r\nfree choice and election of the people, who ought not to be divested of\r\ntheir property (nor justly can) without their consent.\" Similarly the\r\nVirginia House of Burgesses declared: \"The rights of the subjects are so\r\nsecured by law that they cannot be deprived of the least part of their\r\nproperty but by their own consent.\"\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Assembly of 1619, when they assumed the right to tax the\r\npeople, probably did not realize that they were laying the cornerstone\r\nof the structure of American liberty. Yet it was the control of taxation\r\nby the representatives of the people in all the colonies which made it\r\npossible to win victory after victory over the royal Governors. It is an\r\nold saying that one dare not quarrel with one's paymaster. Yet that was\r\njust what most of the Governors had to do. They needed money, money to\r\ncover their own salaries, money with which to pay other government\r\nofficials, money to raise and equip men to fight the Indians, or the\r\nDutch, or the French. The price they had to pay was a part of the royal\r\nprerogative.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the money raised by the levy of 1619 in Virginia\r\nwas to be paid, not to the Governor or to a Treasurer appointed by the\r\nGovernor, but to the Burgesses. The question of who was to receive the\r\nrevenues and who to decide upon their use was second in importance only\r\nto who had the right to levy taxes. It was to give rise to many disputes\r\nbetween Governors and Burgesses.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia in their happiness in the setting up of\r\nrepresentative government seem to have overlooked the King's hostility.\r\nBut they could not have expected him to assent meekly to the duplication\r\nin the infant colony of the Parliament, the body which was causing him\r\nso much trouble and vexation. They might have been warned of what was\r\ncoming when James threw Sir Edwin Sandys in the Tower.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a frontal assault on the London Company. John\r\nFerrar wrote: \"The King, notwithstanding his royal word and honor\r\npledged to the contrary ... was now determined with all his force to ...\r\ngive the death blow....\"[19] He began by ordering a certain Nathaniel\r\nButler to write a pamphlet describing conditions in Virginia. In his\r\n_Unmasking of Virginia_, as he called it, Butler drew a vivid picture of\r\nthe suffering of the people from disease, hunger, and the Indians. In\r\nreply the Company published _A True Answer_, explaining the misfortunes\r\nwhich had plagued the colony, and denying responsibility for them.[20]\r\n\r\nThe King now appointed a commission to inquire into \"all abuses and\r\ngrievances\" in Virginia. In July, 1623, this body reported that most of\r\nthe people sent to the colony were now dead, and that the blame must\r\nrest on the Company. \"If his Majesty's first grant of April 10, 1606,\r\n... had been pursued, much better effects had been produced than had\r\nbeen by the alteration thereof into so popular a course.\"[21] The King\r\nwas elated. He was determined, he said, to \"resume the government, and\r\n... reduce that popular form so as to make it agree with the monarchical\r\nform.\"\r\n\r\nShould the Company agree, he was willing for them to retain their\r\ncharter. But he told them that he was resolved \"by a new charter to\r\nappoint a Governor and twelve assistants, resident here in England, unto\r\nwhom shall be committed the government.\" These assistants were to\r\nappoint a Governor and twelve assistants to reside in Virginia, \"whereby\r\nall matters of importance may be directed by his Majesty.\"[22] In\r\nessence this was the original plan of 1606. There was \"hot debate\" in\r\nthe Company when they met to consider this proposal. Every man present\r\nknew that the fate of the Company hung in the balance. Yet when the\r\nKing's offer was put to the vote, it was rejected by an overwhelming\r\nmajority.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Company now appealed to the House of Commons. But before the Commons\r\ncould act a message came from the King warning them not to meddle in the\r\naffair. \"Ourselves will make it our work to settle the quiet and welfare\r\nof the plantations,\" he said. So, with some \"soft mutterings,\" they\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia waited impatiently for the outcome of the\r\nstruggle which concerned them so deeply. When in March, 1624, the\r\n_Southampton_ arrived with word that James was determined to change the\r\ngovernment, they were in despair. Was liberty to be overthrown? Were\r\nthey to be subjected again to the brutality of a Dale or an Argall? They\r\nwrote the Privy Council praying that future Governors should not have\r\nabsolute authority. \"But above all we humbly entreat your Lordships that\r\nwe may retain the liberty of our General Assembly, than which nothing\r\ncan more conduce to our satisfaction or the public utility.\"[24]\r\n\r\nIf this letter ever reached the Privy Council, it did not stay the\r\nKing's hand. Attorney General Coventry had already issued a _quo\r\nwarranto_ against the Company. Sandys and others fought the case before\r\nthe King's Bench, but the outcome was foregone. On June 26, 1624, the\r\ncharter was overthrown and Virginia became a royal colony.\r\n\r\nCertain historians have contended that, in destroying the Company, James\r\nwas actuated chiefly by economic motives. They point out that the\r\nCompany was divided into factions, that the situation in Virginia was\r\ndesperate, and that the Company was practically bankrupt. Nothing was\r\nleft to show for the L100,000 which had been expended, and unless this\r\ncharge was wiped off the books by dissolving the Company, it would\r\nremain for decades as a burden on the colony. No doubt this may have\r\ninfluenced James in his decision. But he himself said that it had not\r\nbeen his intention to revoke the charters until the Company drove him to\r\nit by refusing to resign the government into his hands. He had resolved,\r\nhe said, \"by altering the charters ... as to point of government ... to\r\nsettle such a course as might cause the said plantation to flourish, ...\r\nBut because the said Treasurer and Company did not submit their charters\r\nto be reformed, our proceedings therein were stayed for a time until ...\r\nthe said charters ... were ... avoided.\"\r\n\r\nThe future of the colony was now left in doubt. James declared his\r\nintention of issuing a new charter. But since this would require \"much\r\ntime and care,\" he appointed a commission headed by Lord Henry\r\nMandeville, to manage the colony in the meanwhile. This body's first\r\nstep was to reappoint Governor Francis Wyatt and his Council, and to\r\nauthorize them to exercise all the powers granted to Yeardley and his\r\nCouncil. But they made no mention of an Assembly.\r\n\r\nJames, in issuing the new charter, no doubt intended to make it conform\r\nto the charter of 1606. Had he done so, he might have delayed the\r\ndevelopment of self-government in Virginia by decades. But before he\r\ncould complete the draft, death overtook him. This dissolved the\r\nMandeville commission, and postponed indefinitely a final settlement of\r\nVirginia affairs.\r\n\r\nCharles I was in sympathy with his father's plans for the colony, but he\r\nseems not to have been deeply concerned about carrying them out. His\r\nfirst step was to place the matter before the Privy Council. The Council\r\ncalled on Sir Edwin Sandys for his opinion. Sir Edwin replied in a long\r\ndocument entitled \"The Discourse of the Old Company of Virginia,\"\r\nadvising the King to restore the Company. This Charles had no intention\r\nof doing. On May 23, 1625, he issued a proclamation declaring \"that his\r\nintention was that the government of Virginia should immediately depend\"\r\nupon himself. It might be proper to commit matters of trade and commerce\r\nto a corporation, but not state affairs. He next outlined a plan of\r\ngovernment for the colony which was essentially the same as that under\r\nthe charter of 1606.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the people of Virginia awaited anxiously. Would the\r\nKing abolish the Assembly? Would another Dale or Argall be sent over for\r\na new reign of terror? They had opposed the dissolution of the Company\r\nbecause they feared it might lead to the abolishing of representative\r\ngovernment. Now that the Company no longer existed they pleaded\r\nearnestly to be permitted to keep the Assembly. In June, 1625, the\r\nGovernor and Council wrote the Privy Council asking that the \"liberty,\r\nof General Assembleys\" be continued in order \"to avoid the oppressions\r\nof Governors.\" This letter they entrusted to Sir George Yeardley, who\r\nsailed with it for England and laid it before the Privy Council.[25]\r\n\r\nThis body hastened to assure the Virginians that the King \"doth take all\r\nthe country and people into his royal protection and government,\" and\r\nthat they were to enjoy all their former privileges. Still they made no\r\npromise that the people should have a voice in the government. And the\r\nKing, because of \"many other urgent occasions,\" still delayed making a\r\npermanent settlement of Virginia affairs. At last, in March, 1626, he\r\nappointed Yeardley to succeed Wyatt, with orders to \"continue the same\r\nmeans that was formerly thought fit for the maintenance of the said\r\ncolony.\"\r\n\r\nWyatt and Yeardley were men of a different stamp from Dale and Argall.\r\nHad they chosen to do so, they could have ruled the colony with no\r\nrestraint save from the Council. But they preferred to keep alive the\r\nspark of representative government. So they called together unofficial\r\ngatherings of leading citizens to sit with the Governor and the Council\r\ninstead of the House of Burgesses. This body they called the \"Governor,\r\nCouncil, and the colony of Virginia assembled together.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of 1624 was automatically dissolved by the death of James\r\nI. So there must have been a new election, since the unofficial House of\r\nBurgesses, had they been appointed by the Governor and Council, would\r\nnot have presumed to tax the people for the funds necessary for carrying\r\non the government. As there was no legal authority for the gatherings\r\ntheir acts were translated into proclamations.[27]\r\n\r\nLegal authority came in an unexpected way. With the demonstration by\r\nJohn Rolfe, the man who married Pocahontas, that tobacco could be raised\r\nin Virginia, the Indian weed had become more and more the staple of the\r\ncolony. Had it been assured of a monopoly of the English market by the\r\nexclusion of foreign tobacco and the prohibition of tobacco planting in\r\nEngland, and not hampered by high custom duties, it would have brought\r\nprosperity and rapid growth.[28] But both James and Charles were\r\nconstantly in need of money, and the revenue from the duty on Spanish\r\ntobacco had been important to them. So in excluding all foreign leaf\r\nthey sought to make good their losses from Virginia tobacco.\r\n\r\nIn 1627 Charles decided to buy the entire colonial crop in the hope of\r\nselling it at a profit. But this he did not venture to do without\r\nsecuring the consent of the planters. That would have violated the\r\nprinciple that a man's property must not be taken without his consent,\r\neither directly or through his representative. So he directed the\r\nGovernor to hold a general election of Burgesses, summon an Assembly,\r\nand place his proposition before them. Thus he gave official recognition\r\nto the House of Burgesses, and it was upon this recognition that its\r\nauthority rested.[29] The Virginians rejected the King's proposal, but\r\nthey kept their Assembly. From this date it became habitual for the\r\nKings to insert in the instructions to a new Governor that he hold an\r\nelection of Burgesses.\r\n\r\nThe setting up of representative government in the first English colony\r\nin America has a double significance. It may be viewed as a part of the\r\nstruggle for supremacy between King and Parliament. Sir Edwin Sandys,\r\nthe champion of liberty in Virginia, was also a champion of liberty in\r\nthe mother country. Had absolutism won in England, its victory in the\r\ncolony would have been certain. And had the King succeeded in ruling the\r\ncolony unrestrained by any representative body there, it would have\r\nstrengthened his hand in England, would have been a defeat for the\r\nliberal group in Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen the first Assembly met in Jamestown, the year before the Pilgrims\r\nlanded on Cape Cod, they established a precedent which was followed in\r\nfuture English settlements. Had absolutism been firmly rooted in\r\nVirginia, the Stuart Kings might have tried to set it up in all the\r\ncolonies. The Massachusetts Bay charter might have been voided, the\r\ncharters of Connecticut and Rhode Island might have had no provision for\r\nrepresentative government.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as it was the need for money which forced the hand of\r\nCharles I and gave legality to the House of Burgesses, so the needs of\r\nall the colonial governments made necessary the calling of legislatures\r\nwhich had the right to levy taxes. It is this which forced the Duke of\r\nYork to call an Assembly in New York in 1684. When the American patriots\r\nof 1775 took up arms because Parliament insisted on taxing them, they\r\nwere not defending some new principle. The principle that one's property\r\ncould be taken only with one's consent antedated the founding of\r\nJamestown. And upon it American liberty was based from the first.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Bath papers_ II, p. 44.\r\n\r\n[2] R. W. K.

The Company could not finance\r\nthe enterprise, and it might have bled the colony to make good its own\r\nlosses. The reactionary group in the Company might in time have won\r\ncontrol, and have gone back to the original form of government.\r\n\r\nIt was this which made the people of Virginia resist all attempts to\r\nre-establish the Company. They were greatly alarmed in 1631 when word\r\nreached them that some of the former members had \"continually importuned\r\nhis Majesty to renew the charter,\" and that the King had actually given\r\norders that a new one be drawn up. Someone, no doubt an agent for the\r\ncolony, protested vigorously. The Governor and Council had \"oftentimes\r\npetitioned ... against the renewing of any such corporation,\" he said,\r\nand he pleaded that nothing be done until they were heard from.\r\n\r\nBut though the Virginians wished to remain under the jurisdiction of the\r\nKing, and not be \"subjects to their fellow subjects,\" they wanted to\r\nplace their government upon a firmer basis as a guarantee that there\r\nwould be no renewal of the \"illegal proceedings and barbarous tortures\"\r\nof former years. On three separate occasions they tried to secure a\r\ncharter guaranteeing their liberties. In 1639, George Sandys, whom they\r\nappointed agent to petition for a charter, seems to have misunderstood\r\nhis instructions, for instead of doing so he attempted to revive the\r\nCompany. When this news reached Virginia, the Assembly hastened to\r\ndisavow his action, and to beg the King to let them remain a royal\r\ncolony. Their yearly Assemblies, authorized in his instructions, insured\r\ntheir present happiness, they said. So they were much relieved when\r\nCharles told them that he had not the least intention of placing any\r\ncorporation over them.\r\n\r\nThis satisfied the Virginians for the moment, but during the Restoration\r\nperiod, on learning that the King had made a series of grants in the\r\ncolony to favorites, they once more petitioned for a charter. And\r\nthough, after prolonged negotiations, a charter was passed under the\r\nGreat Seal,[1] it was so unsatisfactory that in 1691 they made still\r\nanother attempt. When this failed, the colony was forced to remain under\r\nits unwritten constitution, based on precedents, royal letters,\r\nproclamations, and instructions.\r\n\r\nThis constitution provided that the Governor be appointed by the King.\r\nConsequently he represented the authority of the Crown, and through the\r\nCrown the interests of England. If he failed to uphold the royal\r\nprerogative against the assaults of the Burgesses and the Council he was\r\nsure to incur the frowns of his royal master. If the King were bent on\r\nruling the colony with as little interference from the Assembly as\r\npossible, it was the Governor who tried to carry out his orders. In\r\nother words, in the century long battle between the King and the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, it was the Governor who bore the royal\r\nbanner.\r\n\r\nThe Governors varied widely in character and ability. Sir John Harvey\r\nand Francis Nicholson were egocentric men, who tried to lash all who\r\nsurrounded them into obedience to their will. Alexander Spotswood and\r\nRobert Dinwiddie, though not friends of representative government, were\r\nable administrators. Hugh Drysdale, William Gooch, and Lord Botetourt,\r\nbecause of their amiable dispositions, won lasting popularity. Culpeper\r\nand Effingham were hated as instruments in the hands of Charles II and\r\nJames II in imposing the Second Stuart Despotism on the colony. Dunmore\r\nwas detested for his role in the opening years of the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Nicholson, who was in many respects one of the worst\r\nof the Governors, should have given an excellent description of the\r\nideal colonial executive. \"It is absolutely necessary ... that the\r\nGovernor ... may be esteemed by the people, ... to be a lover of them\r\nand their country ... and above all distributes equal justice.\"[2] Had\r\nhe followed his own advice his second administration would not have\r\nended in failure.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Governor were great, so great that even the British\r\ngovernment at times thought they should be used with caution. \"All\r\nthings are made so entirely dependent on the Governor's single will and\r\npleasure, that whenever there may happen an ill man in that post, it\r\ncannot reasonably be expected any person ... should either oppose such\r\nan one in whatever he may attempt or so much as give any advice,\" wrote\r\nthe Lords of Trade in 1698.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Governor's powers differed from time to time, depending upon the\r\nsituation in England, upon developments in the colony, and upon the\r\ncharacter of the Governor. Sir William Berkeley based his power chiefly\r\non the use of the patronage; Effingham's authority was but a reflection\r\nof the despotism of the late Stuart Kings. On the whole, the Governors\r\nof the seventeenth century exercised more power than those of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nAt all times the Governor was respected because back of him was the\r\nawe-inspiring figure of the monarch. If the Councillors or the Burgesses\r\ndefied him, he might report their \"disobedience\" to the King with\r\nserious consequences. On more than one occasion the King ordered the\r\nGovernor to rebuke the Burgesses for their \"presumption\" in disregarding\r\nhis wishes.\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses seem not to have hung their heads at these reprimands, and\r\nit was only when the King tried to abridge their privileges that they\r\nwere deeply concerned. But the greatest danger lay, not in overriding\r\nthe House, but in undermining it by political bribery. The Governor had\r\nin his hands many lucrative offices with which to reward those who voted\r\nas he wished. \"Don't you know there is a sheriff and a clerk in every\r\ncounty, besides other offices of profit in the country?\" Benjamin\r\nHarrison wrote Philip Ludwell, in 1703. \"Is it not the wise man's phrase\r\nthat a gift will blind the eyes of the wise?... Places are now shifted\r\nas often as the occasion requires, to put out or in, as men will or will\r\nnot serve a turn. Sheriffs are turned out in the middle of their\r\ncollection. Clerks are turned out without ever knowing why and so are\r\nother officers.... I need not tell you what men too many of our House of\r\nBurgesses are, how greedy they are to catch at any little place of\r\nprofit, without considering the ill consequence that attends it; like\r\nthe poor harmless fish that eagerly catches at the bait without\r\nconsidering the hook of destruction is under it.... Add a sheriff, a\r\nclerk, or a naval officer's place, and pray who would consider the\r\nQueen's service, the interest of the country, or the discharging a\r\nBurgess's oath!\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe most tempting plum was a seat in the Council. Though this was in the\r\ngift of the King, he almost invariably named the man recommended by the\r\nGovernor. So the Burgess who aspired to it was a patriot indeed if he\r\nset the welfare of the country above his own ambition by opposing the\r\nGovernor in the House.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary for the Governor to make a direct promise; every\r\nman of prominence and wealth knew that he was being watched. But in one\r\ncase at least a bargain was struck. In 1683 Governor Culpeper wrote the\r\nPrivy Council that Isaac Allerton had assured him \"of his utmost\r\nservices in whatsoever the King should command him by his Governor,\" and\r\nhe had promised in return \"that he should be of the Council ... though\r\nnot to be declared till after the session of the next Assembly.\"[5] One\r\nwonders whether Allerton's conscience hurt him when, several years\r\nlater, he took the seat which he had gained by betraying the interests\r\nof those who had elected him.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1691, Governor Nicholson wrote the Lords of Trade\r\nexplaining why he had deferred sending a list of recommendations for\r\nappointment to the Council until after a meeting of the Assembly. \"I\r\nthink it a proper time to try men in, especially considering how many of\r\nhis Majesty's affairs are to be transacted there.\"[6]\r\n\r\nEven when a Carter, or a Byrd, or a Ludwell had taken his seat in the\r\nCouncil, he had to watch his step. If he opposed the Governor too\r\nvigorously he might be suspended. In 1677 Deputy Governor Herbert\r\nJeffreys reported that \"one Ballard of the Council\" was \"a fellow of a\r\nturbulent, mutinous spirit,\" and that he had \"found very just cause of\r\nsuspending him at present both from the Council and collectorship ...\r\nand advancing others more loyal, fit, and honest in his place.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe Governor could crack the whip over the head of any Councillor who\r\ndefied him by threatening to kick him out of certain places of profit\r\nand honor. The Councillors \"have all along held the places of profit in\r\nVirginia by the Governor's gift and during his pleasure,\" Henry\r\nHartwell reported to the Lords of Trade, \"which I have always observed\r\nhas restrained them from due freedom of ... debate.\"[8] It was taken for\r\ngranted that as soon as a man became a Councillor he was to have the\r\nnext vacancy as colonel of militia, or collector of the export duty, or\r\nnaval officer. In the Council of 1692 all save three were colonels. And\r\nif a Councillor were in high favor with the Governor, he might be in\r\nline as Secretary or Auditor.[9]\r\n\r\nIt was the Governor who appointed sheriffs, justices of the peace, and\r\nother local officers. Since the county court had legislative and\r\nadministrative as well as judicial powers it was the ruling body in the\r\ncounty. It even had the right to tax. That the justices were not elected\r\nby the people not only made local government undemocratic, but added\r\ngreatly to the Governor's power. He could always appoint men who were\r\nfavorable to his policies or turn out those who opposed him.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Governor was directed by his instructions to secure the\r\nadvice of the Council before making appointments, he claimed that he did\r\nnot have to accept it, and he often ignored it. Nicholson was bitterly\r\nassailed for appointing sheriffs \"without the advice of the Council,\"\r\nand for putting in and turning out \"colonels, lieutenant colonels,\r\nmajors, captains, and other officers of the militia.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as the decades passed it became more and more the\r\ncustom for the Governor to accept the recommendations of the Councillors\r\nin making appointments, until it assumed almost the character of an\r\nunwritten law that he must do so. In fact it was a colonial precedent\r\nfor Senatorial courtesy in the government of the United States.[10]\r\n\r\nThe Governor had the right to summon, to prorogue, and to dissolve the\r\nAssembly. But he was usually instructed to hold an Assembly at least\r\nonce a year. On the arrival of a new Governor, or the accession of a\r\nKing or Queen, the Assembly was automatically dissolved. The power of\r\nprorogation made it possible for a Governor, when he had a House of\r\nBurgesses to his liking, to continue them indefinitely. That Sir William\r\nBerkeley refused for at least fourteen years to hold a general election\r\nprior to Bacon's Rebellion was bitterly resented by the people.\r\n\r\nThe Governor's veto over legislation, though absolute, was not\r\nfrequently used. If he objected to a bill which came up from the House,\r\nhe could, except on rare occasions, influence the Council to kill it. If\r\nthe Council insisted on passing it, he might affix his signature but\r\nadvise the King to disallow it.\r\n\r\nThe handing out of fat jobs gave the Governor a strangle hold on the\r\ncourts, if we may believe the testimony of Philip Ludwell and Stephen\r\nFouace. \"The influence of a Governor will be great both on judges and\r\nwitnesses, particularly by the multitude of places and other favors he\r\nhas to promise in case they favor him in the trial.... There is little\r\npossibility of having a fair examination.\"[11] Robert Beverley testified\r\nto the bribing of a grand jury by Governor Nicholson. \"The foreman was\r\nfavored with a naval officer's place, ... others had sheriff's places,\r\netc.\"[12]\r\n\r\nNicholson was accused, also, of bullying witnesses, lawyers, and juries.\r\n\"I have heard him at trials, when judges have asked a question or argued\r\nor voted contrary to his humor, snap them up and revile them in a very\r\ncontemptible manner,\" reported Robert Beverley. In the case of Swan\r\nversus Wilson \"he did so grosely abuse Mr. Benjamin Harrison, who was\r\ncounsel for Swan, that everybody cried out shame on it.\" Finally, James\r\nBlair, who was a member of the court, could stand it no longer. So,\r\ntaking off his hat, he rose and said:\r\n\r\n     \"If Mr. Harrison has done any ill thing ... I hope your Excellency\r\n     will find another time to call him to an account for it.... I am\r\n     sorry to see so much of the court's time taken up ... by reason of\r\n     your Excellency's prejudice against him.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, I deny the prejudice, put it down in writing,\" shouted\r\n     Nicholson.\r\n\r\n     \"I hope I have liberty to speak my opinion,\" replied Blair.\r\n\r\n     \"Who hinders you?\"\r\n\r\n     \"I am ashamed to sit here and see people so used,\" retorted Blair.\r\n\r\n     \"Get you gone then. It had been good for the country if they had\r\n     never seen your face.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe Governor was the legal head of the Church, though his authority was\r\ndisputed after the appointment of a Commissary for the Bishop of London.\r\nAnd both Governor and Commissary exercised very limited powers because\r\nof the resistance of the vestries. The Governor had the right to induct\r\nministers after they had been presented by the vestries, but in most\r\ncases they refused to do so. The Governor's power of collation to vacant\r\nparishes remained throughout the colonial period practically a dead\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe Council of State exercised administrative, legislative, and judicial\r\npowers. Hartwell, Blair, and Chilton, in their _The Present State of\r\nVirginia_, thus describe their functions: \"They are the Council of State\r\nunder the Governor, who always presides; and in the vacancy of a\r\nGovernor and Lieutenant Governor, the eldest of the Council is\r\nPresident. They are the Upper House of Assembly, answering to the House\r\nof Peers in England. They are by custom, but without commission, the\r\nsupreme judges (together with the Governor who presides) in all causes\r\n... and there lies no appeal from them but to the King in Council.\"[14]\r\n\r\nAs the advisory body to the Governor, the Council wielded great\r\ninfluence. A Governor who had just taken office and was ignorant of\r\nconditions in the colony had to turn to them for information and advice.\r\nLater, when he was better informed, he still relied upon them for\r\nsupport in upholding the King's authority. If he were confronted with a\r\nmutiny, or an invasion by a hostile fleet, or an Indian war, or a\r\ndecline in the price of tobacco, he was glad to get their views on what\r\nhe should do.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Council originally sat with the Burgesses during\r\nsessions of the Assembly, and did not constitute a separate house.\r\nThough this denied them an equal voice with the Burgesses, since they\r\ncould always be outvoted, it permitted them to enter into debates with\r\nthe Burgesses and serve on committees. It was at the suggestion of\r\nGovernor Culpeper that the King, in 1680, gave orders that the Council\r\nshould sit as a separate house.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Culpeper did this so that he could preside at their legislative\r\nsessions as he did when they sat as a Privy Council or as a court. In\r\nthis way he could keep an eye on them, could argue with them, and bring\r\npressure on them to vote as he wished. It also created a buffer between\r\nhim and the Burgesses, behind which he could take refuge against popular\r\ncriticism. The position of the Councillors was not an easy one since as\r\nappointees of the King they were supposed to defend the royal authority,\r\nand as natives of Virginia they wished to defend her interests. Often\r\nthey found a way out of this difficulty by voting one way and privately\r\nurging the Burgesses to vote the other.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Council all sat on the General Court. Hartwell,\r\nBlair, and Chilton thus describe this body: \"It is strange that they\r\nnever had a commission for holding of this court, nor never took the\r\noath of judges, perhaps it was not designed by the Crown that they\r\nshould hold it, since besides that they are unskilful in law, it is\r\nthought an inconvenient thing in all governments that the justice and\r\npolicy of the government should be lodged in the same persons, who ought\r\nindeed to be a check upon one another.\"[15] It was as though the United\r\nStates Senate were also the Supreme Court. In other words, in colonial\r\nVirginia the same men who, as members of the Upper House of Assembly,\r\nhad voted on a law were called upon to interpret it. Prior to 1680 if a\r\nman thought himself injured in point of law or equity by a decision of\r\nthis court he could appeal his case to the Assembly. But after that\r\ndate, when the judicial powers of the Assembly were voided, his only\r\nappeal was to the King and Privy Council, a step seldom taken because of\r\nthe difficulty \"of either prosecuting or defending matters at such a\r\ndistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe judicial function of the Councillors added greatly to their power\r\nand prestige. \"They are the sole judges of law and property, which makes\r\nall depend on them,\" reported Colonel Quary.[16] The Councillors were\r\nwell aware of the power and prestige which their judicial position gave\r\nthem. This is shown by the bitterness with which they resisted when\r\nGovernor Spotswood tried to weaken it by setting up a court of oyer and\r\nterminer with others than Councillors on the bench.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Council were invariably selected from the wealthiest\r\nmen in the colony. In their own counties they were respected and feared.\r\nTo insult a Byrd, or a Custis, or a Carter would land one in jail. But\r\nif we may believe Governor Nicholson, the poor man would not cringe\r\nbefore them. \"The ordinary sort of planters that have land of their own,\r\nthough not much, look upon themselves to be as good as the best of\r\nthem, for they know, at least have heard, from whence these mighty dons\r\nderive their originals.\" They know that they or their \"ancestors were\r\ntheir equals if not their superiors, and that their getting such estates\r\nand places of honor was more by accident than any extraordinary honesty\r\nor ability in them.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe Council reached the height of its power during the first thirty or\r\nthirty-five years after the Glorious Revolution. Then it was that they\r\ndefied the Governors, and in three cases were largely responsible for\r\ntheir removal. Nicholson complained that they \"set up to have the power\r\nand interest of turning out and putting in Governors, and affect the\r\ntitle that the great Earl of Warwick had.\" Quary said they \"had vanity\r\nenough to think themselves almost upon equal terms with the House of\r\nLords.\" \"They have by degrees endeavored to lessen the prerogative and\r\nrender the Governor little better than a cypher, and in truth they have\r\nin effect gained their point.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were the representatives of the people. They were expected\r\nby all, wealthy landholders and owners of but a few acres, carpenters,\r\ncoopers, clergymen, to uphold the liberties of all against the assaults\r\nof the King or the Governor. The poor turned to them for protection\r\nagainst the rich. Any attempt by the Governor to rule despotically or\r\nillegally was sure to arouse their stubborn resistance. They were in\r\neffect the House of Commons of Virginia, claimed the same privileges,\r\nand observed the same form in their proceedings. Since each county\r\nnormally sent two Burgesses to the Assembly, the House grew in numbers\r\nas new counties were organized.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, during its century and a half of existence, was often\r\nforced to meet in private houses or taverns because of the burning of\r\nthe statehouses, now at Green Spring, the residence of Sir William\r\nBerkeley, now at William Sherwood's house; now at the ordinary of Thomas\r\nWoodhouse. The first statehouse, which occupied a double row of little\r\nbuildings, went up in flames in 1656, the second, which was also the\r\nGovernor's residence, burned in 1660. The third statehouse was more\r\npretentious than its predecessors, being two stories high, with a\r\nmedieval porch in front, the tile-covered roof dominated by chimney\r\nstacks probably in the Tudor style. It was burned by Bacon's rebels in\r\n1676. The fourth statehouse, which seems to have been built on the\r\nfoundations of the third, was destroyed by fire in 1698. It was after\r\nthis last disaster that the seat of government was moved to\r\nWilliamsburg, where a lovely Capitol, which has been accurately restored\r\nby Colonial Williamsburg Inc. in recent years, was completed in 1704.\r\n\r\nThe sessions of the Burgesses in the hall provided for them in this\r\nbuilding presented a picturesque scene. The Speaker, in his gown, sat in\r\na high chair on a raised platform at the semicircular end of the room.\r\nBefore him, in the center of the hall, was a table covered with green\r\ncloth, resting on it the mace, the emblem of the authority of the House.\r\nHere sat the clerk, pen in hand, jotting down notes for the journal.\r\nAlong either side of the room were two rows of benches covered with\r\ngreen serge, where sat the Burgesses. All wore their hats. A strange\r\nmedley they were, with the \"handsome, well dressed, complete\" gentlemen\r\nfrom the tidewater contrasting with the roughly clad frontiersmen.\r\n\r\nThe House was quick to resent any disrespect to themselves as\r\nindividuals or as a body. It was in October, 1693, that Mr. Matthew Kemp\r\nrose to complain of insults offered him and the House by a certain\r\nThomas Rooke. We do not know whether he displayed a bloody nose or a\r\nblack eye, but he accused Rooke of striking him. Thereupon a committee\r\nwas appointed to look into the matter, Rooke was arrested and forced on\r\nhis bended knees to apologize. \"Having now a deep sense and abhorrence,\r\nand out of a true and unfeigned sorrow and repentence,\" he repeated, he\r\nasked forgiveness.[19] After they had released him he may have cursed\r\nthem all under his breath, but for the future he kept his resentment to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for the right to vote changed from time to time. On\r\nthe whole they were liberal, for throughout the colonial period most\r\nfreemen could voice their choice when the candidates for the House of\r\nBurgesses were presented. The constitution of 1621 stated that Burgesses\r\nwere to be chosen by the \"inhabitants.\" If this was interpreted to mean\r\nthat all men, including indentured workers, enjoyed the franchise, it\r\nwas later modified by a law restricting the right to vote to those who\r\npaid taxes. It is revealing of the high value placed on representative\r\ngovernment even by the humblest, that when Governor Berkeley suggested\r\nthat taxes be assessed, not by the poll, but only on landholders, the\r\nBurgesses protested that this would disfranchise great numbers of\r\nfreemen who owned no land at all. \"We are so well acquainted with the\r\ntemper of the people that we have reason to believe they had rather pay\r\ntheir tax than lose their privilege.\"\r\n\r\nSeven years later another attempt to restrict the suffrage was more\r\nsuccessful. Probably at Berkeley's suggestion the Assembly passed a law\r\nthat no man should vote unless he were a landholder or housekeeper. At\r\nthis time poor men who were apt to \"make tumults at the elections\" were\r\npouring in, and the Governor thought it the part of wisdom to deny them\r\nany participation in the government. In England only property owners\r\ncould vote, he argued, why have a different practice in Virginia?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this happened at a time when the people were \"ripe for\r\nrebellion,\" and it merely added to their resentment against the Governor\r\nand his puppet Assembly. It was in an effort to appease them that\r\nBerkeley called for a new election, in 1676, and, ignoring the law, took\r\nit on himself to extend the franchise to \"every free born man.\" When\r\nthis Assembly met, and when Bacon's army was marching on Jamestown, they\r\nconfirmed this ruling by passing a law to give the right to vote to all\r\nfreemen. But with the repeal of Bacon's Laws in 1677, the franchise was\r\nonce more restricted to landowners and housekeepers.\r\n\r\nWhen Culpeper was appointed Governor in 1679, he was ordered to make a\r\nvigorous assault upon liberty in the colony. Among other repressive\r\nmeasures he was instructed to deprive mere housekeepers of the suffrage\r\nand limit it to freeholders. Although this measure was unjust to the\r\nlarge and intelligent artisan class--carpenters, masons, coopers, house\r\npainters, shipwrights, saddlers, gunsmiths, etc., it seems to have\r\nremained in force throughout the remainder of the colonial period.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the Burgesses changed from time to time. At one time the\r\npay was ten shillings a day, at another thirteen shillings, at still\r\nanother 130 pounds of tobacco. In 1718 it was thirty shillings, a sum\r\nwhich Governor Spotswood thought far too much. His criticisms of the\r\npoliticians of his day show that the species has not changed greatly in\r\nthe past two and a half centuries. The salary \"makes needy men try for\r\nthe place who are not qualified for a Senate house,\" he said. \"Those\r\nupon an approaching election set themselves to inventing most false and\r\nmalicious stories.... The country to be sure is ever represented as if\r\nit was to be undone, and none can be judged capable of saving it but\r\nsome of their own mobbish politicians, who engage to pursue the wild\r\nschemes of the electors.\"[20] But when he tried to cut the ground from\r\nunder these false patriots by urging a law requiring the Burgesses to\r\nserve without salary, and restricting further the qualifications for\r\nvoters and for candidates for office, it was overwhelmingly voted down.\r\n\r\nIt was customary for each county to pay the salaries of its two\r\nBurgesses. This was unjust, for it made the burden fall much more\r\nheavily upon the taxpayer in a small county than one in a large county.\r\nIt was harmful, also, as implying that the Burgess was concerned with\r\nthe interests of his county rather than those of the colony as a whole.\r\nSo the people of the thinly settled counties rejoiced when, in the\r\nmid-eighteenth century the Burgesses were paid from the revenue from the\r\nduty on the imports of liquors whenever there was a surplus in this\r\nfund.\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses elected their own Speaker. This officer presided over the\r\ndeliberations of the House, voiced their determinations, and issued\r\nwarrants to execute their orders. In case of a tie he cast the deciding\r\nvote. The office was eagerly sought after, for it carried great\r\ninfluence. In 1699, when Robert Carter was elected, he said in his\r\naddress of acceptance: \"The House of Burgesses, consisting of the better\r\nsort of gentlemen from all parts of the country, to be in this fashion\r\nthe object of their choice I take to be of no small reputation to\r\nme.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe prestige of the office grew with the increasing power of the House,\r\nuntil the Speaker became, next to the Governor, the most influential man\r\nin the colony. It became a fixed custom for the Burgesses to enhance his\r\npay by making him Treasurer. In 1758, when Governor Fauquier was\r\ninstructed to separate the two offices, he was greatly perplexed. The\r\nSpeaker, Mr. John Robinson, is \"the most popular man in the country,\" he\r\nwrote the Lords of Trade, \"beloved by the gentlemen and the idol of the\r\npeople.\" Any slight to him would put a stop to all legislative\r\nbusiness.[22]\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the House of Burgesses its business more and more was\r\ntransacted by committees. The most important were the committees on\r\nPropositions and Grievances, Elections and Privileges, and on\r\nProportioning the Levy. To the first of these came all manner of\r\ncomplaints. One county asks that ship captains be forbidden to throw\r\nballast into the rivers, another wants a ceiling put on doctors' bills,\r\nstill another objects to having taverns extend credit to sailors.\r\n\r\nThe House kept a close watch on elections, and the Committee on\r\nElections and Privileges always went over the writs in search of\r\nirregularities. If a sheriff should fail to make a return or should make\r\nan imperfect return, the messenger was sent to bring him before the\r\nHouse to explain why. Should he take it upon himself to judge who was\r\neligible or not eligible for election, he was certain to receive a stern\r\nreprimand. In 1692 a resolution \"that the House of Burgesses are the\r\nsole and only judges of the capacity or incapacity of their own members\"\r\npassed unanimously.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Private Causes prior to 1680 was in effect the supreme\r\ncourt of Virginia, to which appeals were made, for the House invariably\r\naccepted its findings. But it ceased to function when the Assembly was\r\ndeprived of its judicial power.\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were wary of bills of attainder, the weapon used with such\r\ngreat effect by Parliament. They realized the danger in condemning\r\npersons without trial, especially when the colony had so much at stake\r\nin preserving liberty and justice. But the Assembly of February, 1677,\r\nwhich had been \"hand picked\" by Governor Berkeley, did attaint Bacon and\r\nfifteen of his followers in defiance of the King's pardon.[24] Since all\r\nof the victims were dead, the attaint affected only their property. When\r\nCharles II heard what had been done, he promptly nullified the law.[25]\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were well aware from the first that the universally\r\naccepted principle that no Englishman could be legally taxed without his\r\nown consent was the basis of liberty. They alone, as the representatives\r\nof the people, could take their property. If a Governor, as the\r\nsubstitute for the King, so far stretched his authority as to attempt to\r\nlay a levy, they were quick to call him to order. As early as 1624 the\r\nAssembly passed a law \"that the Governor shall not lay any taxes or\r\nimpositions upon the colony, their lands or commodities, other way than\r\nby the authority of the General Assembly, to be levied and imployed as\r\nthe said Assembly shall appoint.\"[26] Similar laws were passed in 1631,\r\n1632, 1642, and 1645.\r\n\r\nSeveral times the Governor and Council requested the Burgesses to\r\nauthorize them to lay taxes not to exceed a specified sum and for a\r\nlimited period. In 1661 the House did grant such a power, but\r\nthereafter, despite several attempts, the Governor and Council met with\r\nemphatic refusals. In 1680, when Charles II was aiming deadly blows at\r\nliberty in the colonies, the Burgesses yielded to threats, and\r\nsurrendered a part of the people's birthright by voting a perpetual\r\nrevenue to the King.\r\n\r\nWhen the Parliamentary fleet came into the James in 1652 to force the\r\nVirginians to recognize the Commonwealth, the Assembly insisted on\r\ninserting in the articles of surrender the promise \"that Virginia shall\r\nbe free from all taxes, customs, and impositions whatsoever, and none to\r\nbe imposed on them without the consent of the General Assembly.\"[27]\r\n\r\nIn 1675, when the Virginia Assembly sent agents to England to petition\r\nfor a charter, they took pains to point out that \"neither his Majesty\r\nnor any of his ancestors or predecessors had ever offered to impose any\r\ntax upon this plantation without the consent of his subjects here.\"[28]\r\nIt was so universally accepted that only the Assembly could tax the\r\npeople, that the agents thought it necessary to explain why they\r\nconsidered it wise to insert an article confirming this right. \"Not\r\nbeing taxed but by the General Assembly, as it hath been ever the\r\npractice there and the other plantations, so it is a power given them by\r\nroyal instructions, which we conceive ought to be confirmed under the\r\nGreat Seal, for though it might be taken for granted that as they never\r\nhave been, so they never should be otherwise taxed, and that as of right\r\nthey ought to be; yet the power of the Assembly being only in\r\ninstructions, we ordered this further confirmation of it.\"[29]\r\n\r\nCertain historians have assumed that the Americans a century later\r\nannunciated a new principle in claiming that taxation without\r\nrepresentation is tyranny. The fact is that the principle was older than\r\nthe colonies themselves. All the Revolutionary patriots did was to give\r\nit a new and more striking wording. When Parliament passed the Stamp Act\r\nthey were taking an unprecedented step, a step which violated the\r\nage-old rights of Englishmen. And in so doing, they struck a deadly blow\r\nat liberty in America.\r\n\r\nThe most common and the most hated source of income in Virginia was the\r\npoll tax. It was not entirely unequal since it was imposed on all male\r\nwhites over sixteen, all white women over sixteen who worked in the\r\nfields, and all slaves old enough to work. Thus the poor man paid only\r\nfor himself and members of his family, while the rich man paid for his\r\nservants and slaves as well. The poll tax provided revenue, not only for\r\nthe general government, but for the counties and parishes.\r\n\r\nThough the poll tax usually was not excessive, it was a source of\r\nconstant irritation. The poor planter who had worked hard to raise a\r\ncrop of tobacco just large enough to buy necessities for his family,\r\nthought it hard indeed when the sheriff took the government's share.\r\n\r\nThe quit rents paid to the King for all land were an even greater source\r\nof trouble. It was impossible to make men of large estates pay in full,\r\nthere were frauds in disposing of the tobacco in which the rents were\r\npaid, at times the people were so far behind that to enforce payment of\r\narrears would ruin them. The quit rent fund was drawn upon for war\r\npurposes, building of forts, paying salaries, etc. In 1693 Commissary\r\nBlair received a grant of L1985.14.10 from the quit rent fund to found\r\nthe College of William and Mary. When Attorney General Seymour objected\r\nto paying the money, Blair explained that it was the chief purpose of\r\nthe college to train young men for the ministry, and begged him to\r\nconsider that they in Virginia had souls to be saved as well as those in\r\nEngland. \"Souls! Damn your souls! Make tobacco,\" snapped Seymour.[30]\r\n\r\nLocal government was administered by the county courts. Hartwell, Blair,\r\nand Chilton wrote: \"There is a county court in every county, which\r\nconsists of eight or ten gentlemen ... to whom the Governor gives a\r\ncommission during pleasure to be justices of the peace for that county.\r\nHe renews that commission commonly every year, for that ... gives him\r\nan opportunity to admit into it new favorites and exclude others that\r\nhave not been so zealous in his service.... They have court once a\r\nmonth, ... and have a power of deciding all sorts of causes.\"[31] But\r\nthey did not have jurisdiction in cases involving loss of life or limb.\r\n\r\nThat the people had no voice in selecting the justices was greatly\r\nresented, especially since the courts had the power of levying taxes.\r\nThe people of Charles City County complained in 1677 that the justices\r\nhad \"illegally ... taken upon them without our consent from time to time\r\nto impose, raise, assess, and levy what taxes, levies, and impositions\r\nupon us ... they liked, great part of which they have converted to their\r\nown use.\"[32] The people of Surry County made a similar complaint: \"It\r\nhas been the custom of the county courts at the laying of the levy to\r\nwithdraw into a private room by which the poor people not knowing for\r\nwhat they paid their levy did always admire how their taxes could be so\r\nhigh.\"[33]\r\n\r\nIn each county was one or more parishes, presided over by a vestry of\r\ntwelve men each. Since the vestry had the right to lay the parish levy,\r\nit was of great importance that they should be elected by the people.\r\nThis was the practice until Berkeley's second administration, when it\r\nbecame the custom for a vestry, when once chosen at the establishing of\r\na new parish, themselves to fill vacancies in their ranks, and thus to\r\nbecome self-perpetuating.\r\n\r\nHartwell, Blair, and Chilton thought it deplorable that the vestries\r\nhabitually refused to present their ministers for induction, so that\r\nthey could \"keep them in more subjection.\" This was such a hardship on\r\nthe clergy that none who \"were informed of it would come into the\r\ncountry.\" When one did come, he would have to be wary of preaching\r\nagainst any vices \"that any great man of his vestry was guilty of,\" for\r\nfear of losing his place.[34] Yet the vestries themselves were supposed\r\nto be the guardians of the morals of the parishioners. In 1648 a vestry\r\nin Northampton found the wife of a prominent citizen guilty of adultery,\r\nand ordered the minister and church warden to present her to the county\r\ncourt for punishment.\r\n\r\nThe most eagerly sought after offices in the colony were those of\r\nPresident of the Council, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Auditor,\r\nand Treasurer. It was the custom for the senior member of the Council in\r\npoint of service to become President when the office of the Governor was\r\ntemporarily vacant.[35] This was an unsatisfactory arrangement since it\r\nmight happen that the senior Councillor was too old to take on important\r\nand arduous duties. In 1749, when Governor Gooch was about to leave for\r\nEngland, it was decided by the Council that Colonel John Custis, the\r\nsenior member, was \"utterly incapable of managing the business of the\r\ngovernment.\"[36] At their request the Governor suspended him from the\r\nCouncil, so that Thomas Lee, next in order of seniority, could become\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State was appointed by the King. Until 1723 he held\r\noffice only \"during the pleasure\" of the Governor, but thereafter for\r\nlife. The Secretary claimed the right to appoint the clerks of the\r\ncounty courts, who acted as his deputies, and paid him a percentage of\r\nthe income from fees arising from lawsuits and other court proceedings.\r\nBut he seldom made an appointment \"without the Governor's knowledge and\r\ngood liking.\"\r\n\r\nContemporary writers agree that the Secretary's office was a jungle of\r\ncourt records, surveys, commissions, deeds for land, probates of wills,\r\nwrits of elections, marriage certificates, etc. If we may believe\r\nBenjamin Harrison it was usually in wild confusion. \"Nothing hath been\r\nmore common of late years than to hear people complain that they could\r\nnot find the records of their patents or other deeds for their\r\nlands.\"[37] Apparently all kinds of documents were piled up together\r\ninstead of being sorted and filed separately. \"It is almost impossible\r\nto give a full and perfect account of the Secretary's office, there is\r\nsuch a medley in it that its scarce credible,\" wrote Hartwell, Blair,\r\nand Chilton.\r\n\r\nThe Auditor for Virginia was appointed by the Auditor of the\r\nPlantations, usually upon the recommendation of the Governor. This\r\nofficer audited the accounts of the quit rents, the export duty,\r\nescheats, etc., certified their accuracy, and reported to England. He\r\nreceived 7-1/2 per cent of all the monies passing through his hands.\r\nThere seems to have been great laxness at times in the handling of\r\nfunds. When Auditor William Byrd died in December, 1704, it was found\r\nthat the account was overdrawn by L7,698.9.10.[38] It is not surprising\r\nthat Governor Nicholson, while waiting for William Blathwait, the\r\nAuditor of the Plantations, to appoint Byrd's successor, decided to\r\n\"take that trouble\" on himself.[39]\r\n\r\nPhilip Ludwell, who was made Auditor in 1712, seems to have been just as\r\ncareless as Byrd. In December, 1715, Governor Spotswood called the\r\nattention of the Council to the confusion in his office. \"Only gross\r\nsums are entered in one general account,\" he said, \"and the particular\r\naccounts of the receivers ... only kept in loose papers.\"[40] When he\r\nrecommended several reforms, Ludwell told him in effect to mind his own\r\nbusiness, and that he would take orders only from the Auditor General.\r\nThereupon Spotswood suspended him from his office. Ludwell came back\r\nwith a letter \"stuffed with virulent invectives,\" denying the legality\r\nof this action.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1691 the Treasurer was appointed by the Governor, but that year\r\nthe Burgesses claimed the right of naming him, and despite the\r\nopposition of the Governors, eventually had their way. The Treasurer\r\nreceived the funds from various taxes and made up the accounts. He\r\nreceived six per cent of the money collected.\r\n\r\nOutwardly the government of Virginia changed little during the century\r\nand a half from the fall of the London Company to the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Actually throughout the colonial period vital developments\r\nwere taking place. Both the Council and the House of Burgesses were\r\ntireless in whittling away at the King's prerogative; the Council\r\ngradually took out of the Governor's hands the right of naming local\r\nofficials; the control of the purse by the Burgesses was used to such\r\ngood effect that by the middle of the eighteenth century their influence\r\nwas greater than that of either Governor or Council.\r\n\r\nWe gain glimpses of the changes which were taking place, not by changes\r\nin the laws, but by seemingly unimportant incidents, and by the spirit\r\nof the times. What would Charles II have thought had Sir William\r\nBerkeley written him, boasting of his influence with the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Burgesses? Yet that is just what Governor Fauquier did in\r\n1758.\r\n\r\nIt was the determined, unflagging, bitter battle for self-government\r\nwhich brought victory to the people. We see them putting Governor John\r\nHarvey aboard a vessel and sending him back to England, when he tried to\r\nplay the despot; we see them rising in wild rebellion against the\r\nmisgovernment of Sir William Berkeley; we see them defending their\r\nliberty against the assaults of Charles II and James II.\r\n\r\nThe English government was warned repeatedly of what was going on. \"I\r\nmay truly say that now or never is the only time to maintain the Queen's\r\njust prerogative and put a stop to these wrong, pernicious notions which\r\nare improving daily, not only in Virginia, but in all her Majesty's\r\nother governments,\" wrote Colonel Robert Quary, in 1705. \"A frown now\r\nfrom her Majesty will do more than perhaps an army hereafter.\"[41] In\r\nanother report he said that the Assembly \"conclude themselves entitled\r\nto all the rights and privileges of an English Parliament.\" Nicholson\r\nsaid that the Virginians wished to set up a commonwealth.\r\n\r\nBut Nicholson was wrong. The Virginians of his day, and their sons and\r\ngrandsons after them were loyal to the British Kings, wished to remain\r\nin the British Empire. But they were determined to govern themselves in\r\nall except imperial matters. What they wanted was liberty, not\r\nindependence. And liberty they attained decades before the Stamp Act,\r\ndecades before Patrick Henry said: \"Give me liberty or give me death.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] W. W.

Was King\r\nCharles still raising funds with which to run the government by means of\r\nforced loans? Was he still billeting his soldiers on the people? Was\r\nmartial law in force? They must have been thrilled to hear of the\r\nPetition of Rights in which the House of Commons protested against\r\nCharles' arbitrary rule.\r\n\r\nWhen the Burgesses came to town for a session of the Assembly, the\r\nstruggle between King and Parliament must have been the chief topic of\r\nconversation around the table in each crude little tavern. Now it was\r\nthe jailing of nine members of the House of Commons; now the granting of\r\nmonopolies; now the collecting of ship money; now the suppression of\r\nfree speech; now the proceedings of the Star Chamber; now the efforts of\r\nArchbishop Laud to enforce religious conformity.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians were fully aware that these events affected them\r\nprofoundly. They had just won a degree of self-government. If the King\r\nsucceeded in his efforts to make himself absolute in England, all their\r\ngains might be lost. Might he not overthrow their Assembly? If he could\r\nimprison men arbitrarily in England, he would not hesitate to do so in\r\nVirginia. If he could tax the people of England under the thin veil of\r\nloans, or the revival of ancient laws, would he hesitate to tax the\r\ncolonists without their own consent? Might he not place over them\r\nanother Dale or Argall to hang men or break them on the wheel?\r\n\r\nSo when Sir George Yeardley, their liberal Governor, died in November,\r\n1627, they were filled with grief. They remembered that it was he who\r\nhad brought over the Virginia Magna Carta, and had called the first\r\nAssembly. We have lost \"a main pillar of this our building and thereby a\r\nsupport to the whole body,\" wrote the Council.[1]\r\n\r\nTheir concern must have been all the greater because Yeardley's\r\ncommission of March 14, 1626, named John Harvey as his successor. The\r\nVirginians knew this man well. He had been one of the King's\r\ncommissioners who came to the colony in 1624 to draw up a report on\r\nconditions there to be used in overthrowing the charter of the Company.\r\nJust why it was thought that he was the right man to act as Governor is\r\nnot apparent, for he was a mariner by vocation and had served as captain\r\nof a ship which went to the East Indies in 1617. In November, 1625, we\r\nfind him in command of a ship in the expedition against Cadiz. He may\r\nhave owed his appointment as Governor to Viscount Dorchester, the\r\nSecretary of State, whom he thanked for his \"wonted nobleness\" to him.\r\n\r\nBut Virginia was to have a breathing space before Harvey's arrival.\r\nYeardley's commission had specified that in the absence of Harvey the\r\nCouncil should elect one of their number to act in his place. They chose\r\nCaptain Francis West, brother of Lord De la Warr.[2] West was a seasoned\r\nVirginian, for he had come to the colony in 1608 with Captain Newport.\r\nHe had been commander of Jamestown many years, and a member of the\r\nCouncil since 1619. It was during his brief administration that the\r\nfirst legal Assembly since the dissolution of the London Company was\r\ncalled together, the Assembly which rejected the King's proposal for a\r\ntobacco contract.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1629, West was appointed agent for the colony and sent to\r\nEngland. To serve as Governor until his return or the arrival of Harvey,\r\nthe Council chose Dr. John Pott. This man had been in Virginia since\r\n1621, when he came over as \"Physician to the Company\" and member of the\r\nCouncil. He was described as \"a Master of Arts ... well practiced in\r\nchirurgery and physic, and expert in distilling of waters, besides many\r\nother ingenious devices.\"[3] He seems to have consumed a goodly quantity\r\nof \"distilled waters\" himself, for he was fond of his cups and jovial\r\ncompany. George Sandys wrote of him that \"he kept company too much with\r\nhis inferiors, who hung upon him while his good liquor lasted.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe most notable of Pott's \"ingenious devices\" was the poisoning of a\r\nlarge number of Indians after the massacre of 1622. In justification of\r\nthis act, his friends explained that the barbarous and perfidious\r\nsavages knew nothing about the rules of war, so it was fair play to\r\nresort to anything that tended to their ruin. But this did not save Pott\r\nfrom criticism in England. The Earl of Warwick was so shocked that at\r\nhis request Pott was left out of the Council because \"he was the\r\npoisoner of the savages there.\" But he seems to have been forgiven, for\r\nin 1626 we find him once more in his seat.\r\n\r\nIt was during Pott's administration that Lord Baltimore visited\r\nVirginia. In 1623 he had received a grant of land in Newfoundland, and\r\nhad planted a colony of English Catholics there. But when four years\r\nlater he visited the place, he found \"the air so intolerable cold as it\r\nis hardly to be endured.\" He wrote King Charles that he had decided to\r\nmove with some forty persons to Virginia, and petitioned for \"a precinct\r\nof land there.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 1, 1629, he, with his wife and children, arrived at\r\nJamestown. Here he met with a cool reception. A certain Thomas Tindall\r\ngot into an altercation with him, called him a liar, and threatened to\r\nknock him down. The Virginians did not want in their midst a group of\r\nCatholics who were trying to lop off one of the most fertile parts of\r\ntheir territory. So to get rid of them the Governor and Council tendered\r\nmy Lord the oath of supremacy, knowing that as a Catholic he could not\r\ntake it, for to do so was to acknowledge the King as the supreme\r\nauthority in ecclesiastical matters. When he refused they asked him to\r\nleave. This he did, but since he left his family in Virginia, it was\r\nobvious that he intended to return. So William Claiborne was sent after\r\nhim as agent for the colony to oppose his designs.\r\n\r\nTo add to the troubles of the people, in the early spring of 1630 Harvey\r\narrived and took his seat as Governor. He had lingered in England to\r\nmake sure that the office would yield a good return. Only after the King\r\nhad promised him the fines imposed by any of the courts did he set sail.\r\nHis voyage was far from being pleasant, for his ship was leaky, he was\r\ndelayed at the Cape Verde Islands by a Dutch fleet, and he was laid low\r\nby \"a great sickness\" that attacked him at sea.[5]\r\n\r\nAfter landing it was several weeks before he was able to take over his\r\nduties. But after he had done so, his intentions at once became\r\napparent. The man was by nature a despot. The despotism of Sir Edmund\r\nAndros in New England and of Lord Howard of Effingham in Virginia in the\r\nyears just preceding the Glorious Revolution stemmed, not so much from\r\nthe character of these men, as from the deliberate policy of Charles II.\r\nThere is no evidence that Charles I ordered Harvey to make himself\r\nabsolute. He had too many troubles at home to give much thought to\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nIt may have been Harvey's training as a sea captain which made him\r\nimpatient of restraint. In Virginia he acted as though he were still on\r\nthe deck of his ship thundering out commands which no one must question.\r\nIf the King were in Virginia, would not his orders be obeyed? Then why\r\nnot the orders of his Governor? He never tired of reminding the members\r\nof the Council and others that he was the King's substitute. When to his\r\npassion for power are added his rudeness and violence, his avarice and\r\ndisregard for the rights of others, we have the picture of one utterly\r\nunsuited to be the chief executive of a liberty loving people.\r\n\r\nHarvey was accused of diverting public funds to his own pocket, but of\r\nthis we have no direct proof. It is probable that he tried to levy taxes\r\nwithout the consent of the Assembly. Otherwise one wonders why the\r\nAssembly should have thought it necessary to order \"that the Governor\r\nand Council shall not lay any taxes or impositions upon the colony ...\r\notherwise than by the authority of the Grand Assembly.\"[6]\r\n\r\nBut it was chiefly through the courts that he carried out his designs.\r\nHe himself presided over the quarter court, and it was he who appointed\r\nthe commissioners or justices who sat on the local courts. Thus it was\r\nnot difficult for him to secure any verdict he wished. So he had at hand\r\nan instrument to satisfy his lust for power by crushing those who\r\nresisted him, and his lust for money by imposing heavy fines. It should\r\nhave been obvious to Charles I when he agreed to give Harvey all fines\r\nand amercements, that it was a dangerous thing to permit a judge, or one\r\nwho appointed judges, to profit from his or their decisions.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious abuse of the judicial power by Harvey was his\r\nprosecution of Dr. Pott. Charging the pleasure-loving physician with\r\npardoning murder and marking other men's cattle for his own, he\r\nsuspended him from the Council, and confined him to his plantation\r\npending the day of his trial. When Pott defied the Governor's order and\r\ncame to Elizabeth City, Harvey put him in prison and set a guard around\r\nit. In July, 1630, he was put on trial.\r\n\r\nWe have only one detail of the proceedings, but that like a flash is\r\nrevealing of Pott's character and of the farcical character of the\r\nprosecution. When a certain Richard Kingswell testified against him,\r\nPott declared that he was as great a liar and hypocrite as Gusman of\r\nAlfrach. He was referring to the book by Mateo Aleman, of Seville, in\r\nwhich Gusman is shown first as a scullion, then as an errand boy, then\r\nas a thief, then as a pretended gentleman who cheated his creditors.[7]\r\nBut this thrust did not save him. He was convicted, and his entire\r\nestate confiscated.[8]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that in this case Harvey was actuated more by a desire to\r\nshow his power than by avarice. If he could humble so prominent a man as\r\nPott, one who had been acting Governor, others would stand in awe of\r\nhim. \"It will be a means to bring people to ... hold a better respect to\r\nthe Governor than hitherto they have done,\" he wrote.[9] But having\r\nshown his power to ruin, he now sought to show that he could also\r\nrestore. So he wrote the King suggesting clemency. \"For as much as he is\r\nthe only physician in the colony, and skilled in the epidemical diseases\r\nof the planters ... I am bound to entreat\" your Majesty to pardon\r\nhim.[10]\r\n\r\nA more sincere plea came from the doctor's wife, Elizabeth. Getting up\r\nfrom a sick bed, she made the long and dangerous voyage to England to\r\ncomplain to the King \"touching the wrong\" done her husband. Charles\r\nreferred the case to the Virginia Commissioners, who listened\r\nsympathetically as she poured out the story of injustice and\r\npersecution.[11] They concluded that there had been \"some hard usage\r\nagainst\" Pott, and recommended that the King pardon him. Accordingly,\r\nCharles forgave his \"offences\" and restored his property.[12] But the\r\njovial doctor never regained his seat in the Council.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of Pott set the example for others. \"The Governor\r\nusurped the whole power in all causes without any respect to the votes\r\nof the Council,\" reported Samuel Mathews, \"whereby justice was done but\r\nso far as suited his will to the great loss of many men's estates and a\r\ngeneral fear in all.\" If other members of the court opposed him, he\r\nwould revile them and tell them they were there merely to advise him. He\r\ncould accept or reject their opinions as he liked, since \"the power lay\r\nin himself to dispose of all matters as his Majesty's substitute.\"[13]\r\n\r\nWith the General Court dominated by the overbearing and avaricious\r\nGovernor no man was safe. At any moment one might be hauled before the\r\nbar, charged with some petty offence, found guilty, and given a ruinous\r\nfine. Mathews said that there were an \"infinite number of particular\r\nmen's grievances.\"[14] William Claiborne thought it strange that Harvey\r\n\"should so demean himself,\" for \"all men were wronged, and even good and\r\nbad had forsaken him.\"[15] It was in every man's mouth that \"no justice\r\nwas done.\" When a report of these things reached England, Sir John\r\nWolstenholm, one of the Virginia Commissioners, said that \"Sir John\r\nHarvey stunk in Court and city.\"[16]\r\n\r\nHarvey's attempts to make himself absolute, his disregard of other men's\r\nrights, his perversion of justice did not go unchallenged. Soon the\r\nmeetings of the Council became stormy. The Governor insisted that he, as\r\nthe King's substitute, had a right to determine all things. The\r\nCouncillors were merely his assistants, whose duty it was to advise him,\r\nbut not to oppose him. But the Councillors dissented vigorously. Look at\r\nyour commission, they told him, and you will see that it directs that\r\nall matters must be determined by the majority of voices. Does it not\r\nsay that the King grants to the Governor and Council \"and the greater\r\nnumber of you respectively full power and authority to execute\" the\r\nduties of the executive body?\r\n\r\nSoon Harvey was filling his letters with complaints of the opposition of\r\nthe Council. \"For instead of giving me assistance, they stand contesting\r\nand disputing my authority, averring that I can do nothing but what they\r\nshall advise me, and that my power extendeth no further than a bare\r\ncasting voice.\"[17] He had shown them a letter from the King\r\nstrengthening his commission, but they refused to budge from their\r\nposition. He would be grateful if his Majesty would be so explicit \"that\r\nthe place of Governor and the duty of Councillors may be known and\r\ndistinguished.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe Privy Council answered by warning both sides to put an end to their\r\ndisputes and cooperate with each other in advancing the good of the\r\ncolony. So they drew up and signed a formal reconciliation. They\r\npromised \"to swallow up and bury\" all complaints, and to turn their\r\n\"alienated and distempered\" minds to thoughts of love and peace. The\r\nCouncillors vowed to give the Governor \"all the service, honor, and due\r\nrespect which belongs to him as his Majesty's substitute.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation proved a sham. Harvey continued to be overbearing and\r\narbitrary; the Councillors were as bitter as ever. When one of them,\r\nThomas Hinton, in an outburst of anger gave Harvey some \"ill words,\" he\r\nousted him from his seat. Love and peace were far indeed from the\r\nGovernor's mind when he responded to some \"ill language\" from Captain\r\nRichard Stevens by landing a blow in his face with a cudgel and knocking\r\nout some of his teeth.[20]\r\n\r\nIn 1634 a certain Captain Thomas Young arrived in Virginia with a\r\ncommission from the King authorizing him to discover and search the\r\nunexplored parts of the colony. Needing two shallops, and hearing that\r\none of the planters had an indentured worker who was a skilled\r\nshipwright, he seized him and put him to work. In this violation of\r\nproperty rights he was supported by the Governor. But it aroused the\r\nanger of the Council, and several of them came to Harvey to demand an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nHarvey may have had in mind the Forced Loans as a precedent for taking\r\nthe property of the subject, when he replied that his Majesty had given\r\nYoung \"authority to make use of any persons he found there.\" Young\r\nneeded the shipwright \"to prosecute with speed the King's service,\" he\r\nsaid. Speaking for the others, Samuel Mathews retorted angrily that if\r\nthings were done in that fashion it would breed ill blood in Virginia.\r\nTurning his back he whirled a truncheon he carried in his hand, and\r\nlashed off the heads of some high weeds.[21] The Governor, ignoring\r\nthis, said: \"Come, gentlemen, let us go to supper, and for the night\r\nleave this discourse.\" But they were in no humor to be appeased. With\r\none accord they turned their backs and left \"in a very irreverent\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nThe Virginians were further embittered against Harvey for the aid he\r\ngave to Lord Baltimore's settlers. It was on February 27, 1634, that the\r\n_Ark_ and the _Dove_, with Leonard and George Calvert, twenty \"gentlemen\r\nadventurers,\" and three-hundred laborers, arrived at Point Comfort. They\r\nbore a letter to the Governor from the King requiring him to treat them\r\nwith courtesy and respect, permit them to buy cattle and other\r\ncommodities, and do all he could to advance their settlement.\r\n\r\nHarvey did his best to comply. He sent them some of his own cows and\r\npromised to procure more. But this was not easy. The planters were so\r\noutraged at having a part of their territory torn away for a colony of\r\nCatholics that they swore they would knock their cattle on the head\r\nrather than sell them to the Marylanders. Some of the members of the\r\nCouncil had been informed by letters from England of Lord Baltimore's\r\nplans. When Samuel Mathews opened one of them, he threw his hat on the\r\nground in a fury, stamped, and cried: \"A pox upon Maryland!\"[22] He,\r\nwith William Claiborne and other members of the Council, held many\r\nsecret meetings to decide upon a course of action. But they were\r\npowerless to prevent the _Ark_ and the _Dove_ from moving up the\r\nChesapeake Bay with the newcomers, and the founding of a little town\r\nnear the mouth of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nThree years before their arrival Claiborne had made a settlement on Kent\r\nIsland in the Chesapeake near the site of Annapolis. So now he found\r\nhimself torn from Virginia and handed over to another government. The\r\nresult was open warfare. It was prophetic of the battle between the\r\nMerrimac and the Monitor in Chesapeake waters more than two centuries\r\nlater, when two pinnaces full of armed men captured an armed vessel sent\r\nout by the Kent Islanders.\r\n\r\nWhen this news reached Jamestown there was great indignation. Harvey\r\ntried to justify the Marylanders, but this merely intensified the\r\npeople's hatred of him. So he not only aids in the dismemberment of\r\nVirginia, it was said, but upholds the intruders in murdering our\r\npeople. Is it right that one who is Governor of the colony should side\r\nwith her enemies?\r\n\r\nThe crisis came in 1635. King Charles, ever pressed for money, tried\r\nonce more to secure a tobacco contract. So he wrote Harvey directing him\r\nto call an Assembly and to ask for \"the sole pre-emption of all\r\ntobacco,\" at a lower price and a reduced quantity. The members of the\r\nCouncil, especially Samuel Mathews, John Utie, and William Pierce,\r\nopposed the contract \"very saucily.\"[23] As for the Burgesses, they\r\nhated all contracts. So they drew up an answer which was in effect a\r\nrefusal. In order to give the paper the character of a petition they all\r\nsigned it. This they gave to Harvey to send to the King.\r\n\r\nBut instead of forwarding it, the Governor detained it. In excuse of\r\nthis arbitrary action he said he feared the King \"would not take well\r\nthe matter thereof, and that they should make it a popular business by\r\nsubscribing a multitude of hands thereto, as thinking thereby to give it\r\ncountenance.\"[24] The people were outraged. So our Governor takes it on\r\nhimself to decide what or what not we shall say to our King. Is it not\r\nthe right of all Englishmen to address their sovereign? \"The wrong done\r\nby the Governor to the whole colony in detaining the foresaid letters to\r\nhis Majesty did exceedingly perplex them, whereby they were made\r\nsensible of the condition of the present government,\" wrote Samuel\r\nMathews.[25]\r\n\r\nThings had now come to a head. A petition demanding a redress of\r\ngrievances was drawn up, which Francis Pott, brother of Dr. John Pott,\r\ntook about the country. Everywhere he found the people tired of Harvey's\r\narbitrary conduct, tired of his injustice to individual persons. So they\r\npressed forward eagerly to sign the petition. Harvey says that only in\r\nAccomac did they refuse.[26]\r\n\r\nIt was in April, 1635, that Pott, Captain Nicholas Martian, and William\r\nEnglish, the sheriff of York County, addressed a gathering at the house\r\nof William Warren. This meeting has a special significance in the long\r\nstruggle for American liberty, for Warren's house was on or near the\r\nsite of the Moore House, at Yorktown, where the British army under Lord\r\nCornwallis surrendered a century and a half later. The speakers were\r\ndenouncing Harvey's despotic government when some friends of the\r\nGovernor tried to enter. A servant kept them out, but they hung around\r\noutside and \"bended themselves to hearken to the discourse among\r\nthem.\"[27] When the speeches were concluded those present gathered\r\naround the petition and affixed their signatures.\r\n\r\nWhen this was reported to Harvey, he flew into a rage. Calling the\r\nCouncil, he issued warrants for the arrest of Francis Pott, English, and\r\nMartian. They were brought up in irons. Pott handed over the petition\r\nand declared that if he had offended he appealed to the King. \"He was\r\nsure of no justice from Sir John Harvey.\" When the prisoners asked why\r\nthey were arrested, the Governor told them that they would be told at\r\nthe gallows. So they were hustled off to prison.[28]\r\n\r\nHarvey then called the Council together again and told them that it was\r\nnecessary to try the prisoners by martial law. But the Councillors\r\ninsisted on a legal trial. In the dispute which followed Harvey became\r\nviolently angry. Finally, he sat down and ordered the others to sit.\r\nLooking around with a frown, he said: \"I am to propound a question to\r\nyou.... What do you think they deserve that have gone about to persuade\r\nthe people from their obedience to his Majesty's substitute?\"\r\n\r\nTurning to George Menefie, he said, \"I begin with you.\" Menefie answered\r\nthat since he was but a young lawyer he did not dare give an opinion\r\n\"upon the sudden.\" Here Nicholas Farrar interposed to protest against\r\nthis method of proceeding. But Harvey cut him short with the command to\r\nhold his tongue until he was spoken to. Thereupon Samuel Mathews spoke\r\nup to enter his protest. But instantly, in the King's name, he was told\r\nto be silent. Mathews insisted there was no precedent for this attempt\r\nto make men incriminate themselves unless it was that by a tyrant. Here\r\nhe was alluding to the passage in Shakespeare's _King Richard_ III in\r\nwhich Richard asked Lord Hastings what should be done to the women who\r\nhad bewitched him. Hastings replied that if they had done so they ought\r\nto die. \"Talk'st thou to me of ifs,\" replied Richard, \"thou art a\r\ntraitor. Off with his head.\" Harvey evidently did not relish being\r\ncompared to Richard, and so retorted with many \"bitter languages.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThe Councillors were now determined to bring their dispute with the\r\nGovernor to an issue. The next time he summoned them to meet, they\r\nbrought with them fifty musketeers and concealed them near the house.\r\nHarvey asked them with a stern look what they thought was the reason for\r\nthe petition against him. \"The chief cause was the detaining of the\r\nletters to his Majesty,\" replied Mr. Menefie. This infuriated Harvey.\r\nRising from his chair, he struck Menefie a resounding blow on the\r\nshoulder, saying: \"I arrest you on suspicion of treason to his Majesty.\"\r\nBut now he had gone too far. Utie and Mathews seized him, exclaiming:\r\n\"And we you upon suspicion of treason to his Majesty.\"[30]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Dr. Pott, who was standing near the door, held up his\r\nhand as a signal, and the musketeers came running up \"with their pieces\r\npresented.\" \"Stay here until there be use of you,\" Pott commanded. In\r\nthe meanwhile, Mathews had forced Harvey down into a chair. \"Sir, there\r\nis no harm intended against you only to acquaint you with the grievances\r\nof the inhabitants,\" he told him. So he poured out the recital of the\r\nwrongs done the colony and demanded that they be redressed. But the\r\nGovernor, who was in no mood for making concessions, denied that any\r\nwrong had been done. After an ominous pause Mathews said: \"Sir, the\r\npeople's fury is up against you and to appease it is beyond our power,\r\nunless you please to go for England.\" Harvey replied that the King had\r\nsent him to Virginia to be Governor, and he would not leave until he\r\nordered him to do so.\r\n\r\nBut he soon changed his mind. That night a courier came riding up with a\r\nletter to Harvey from Thomas Purifie, who seems to have been one of his\r\nfew friends in the Council, giving an alarming report of the threatening\r\nattitude of the people. At first the Governor said he would defy them to\r\ndo their worst. Would it not be better to remain, though he be cut in a\r\nthousand pieces, than to desert his charge? he asked Secretary Richard\r\nKemp. Kemp replied that for him to remain might \"hazard the King's\r\nservice\" by provoking the infuriated people to further acts of violence.\r\nSo at last he yielded and promised to leave.[31]\r\n\r\nThe rebellious Councillors now took over the government. They released\r\nEnglish, Martian, and Francis Pott, forced Harvey to deliver his\r\ncommission and instructions to Secretary Kemp, set an armed guard around\r\nhim ostensibly to protect him from violence, posted armed men in \"all\r\nways and passages,\" called a General Assembly, and sent out a\r\nproclamation inviting the people to lay their grievances before it, and\r\nappointed their senior member, John West, a brother of Lord De la Warr,\r\nacting Governor.[32]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Harvey had left Jamestown to seek refuge in the house\r\nof Mr. William Brocas, \"whose wife was generally suspected to have more\r\nfamiliarity with him than befitted a modest woman.\" Here he thought\r\nhimself secure enough to dismiss his guard. And from here he wrote a\r\nthreatening letter to the members of the Assembly, commanding them in\r\nthe King's name to disperse. He also wrote Secretary Kemp demanding the\r\nreturn of his commission and instructions. The Councillors seized the\r\nfirst letter, refused to read it to the Burgesses, and the Assembly went\r\non with the consideration of the grievances, \"which were innumerable.\"\r\nAs for the commission and the instructions, they had taken them from\r\nKemp and turned them over to Menefie for safe keeping.[33]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly now passed resolutions accusing Harvey of misgovernment and\r\ninjustice, and explaining why the people had been driven to the extreme\r\nexpedient of sending him back to England. As their agent to deliver\r\nthese papers to the King they appointed one of the Burgesses, Thomas\r\nHarwood. With him went Francis Pott to plead his case before the King.\r\nSince it would be several months before the tobacco ships sailed for\r\nEngland, there seems to have been only one vessel leaving at the time.\r\nSo Harvey, as well as Pott and Harwood, had to embark on it.\r\n\r\nAs events turned out this was unfortunate. Not that Harvey's frowns and\r\nthreats frightened Pott and Harwood, but that it gave him a chance to\r\nfrustrate their plans when they landed at Plymouth. Hardly had the ship\r\ntouched dock when he hastened to see the mayor of the city to tell him\r\nof the \"late mutiny and rebellion\" in Virginia. So the mayor put Pott\r\nunder arrest \"as a principal author and agent thereof,\" and seized the\r\ntrunk containing the papers entrusted to Harwood. Pott was dragged off\r\nto London and locked up in the old debtors' prison called the Fleet.[34]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Harwood had set off post haste to get to London ahead\r\nof Harvey so as to make friends and tell of his misgovernment. He got a\r\nride with the postman who was carrying the mail. At Exeter he stopped at\r\nthe Sign of the Valiant Soldier, and drank a pint of wine with the\r\nproprietor. This seems to have loosened his tongue, for he poured out\r\nthe story of Harvey's misdeeds to this stranger, told him of his\r\nmission, and added that if Harvey ever returned to Virginia \"he would be\r\npistolled or shot.\"[35]\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether Harwood or Harvey won the race to London. But it\r\nwas the Governor who succeeded in gaining the support of the King and\r\nthe Privy Council. It is possible that his accusation that Harwood \"was\r\none of the chief of the mutineer Burgesses that opposed his Majesty's\r\nservice in the tobacco contract and in stirring up the country to this\r\nmutiny,\" may have landed him in prison. At all events, when the Privy\r\nCouncil met, the Governor had things his own way.\r\n\r\nThe King was greatly surprised that the Virginians had dared defy him by\r\nousting their duly appointed Governor. He was determined to send Harvey\r\nback if but for one day, he said. And should he clear himself of the\r\ncharges against him, he would keep him there longer than he had\r\nintended. As a further vindication of his authority, he gave orders that\r\nWest, Mathews, Utie, and Pierce, the leaders of the mutiny, be brought\r\nto England \"to answer their misdemeanors.\" He also directed the Attorney\r\nGeneral to draw up a new commission for Harvey with an enlargement of\r\nhis powers.[36]\r\n\r\nThough Harvey may have been a bit nervous over the threat of\r\n\"pistoling,\" he was too anxious to regain his confiscated property and\r\nget revenge on his enemies to hesitate to return to Virginia. He made no\r\nsecret of his intention to confiscate the property of those who had so\r\nhumiliated him. As for Samuel Mathews, whose estate consisted largely of\r\ncattle, he vowed he would leave him not worth a cow's tail.[37] Yet he\r\nthought it prudent to ask for one of the King's ships, explaining that\r\nthis would \"much abate the boldness of the offenders.\" So on October 2,\r\n1636, he set forth proudly in the _Black George_. But he did not get\r\nvery far. The _Black George_ proved so leaky that for a while it seemed\r\nthat it might prove a Godsend to Virginia by taking Sir John to the\r\nbottom. But it turned back and succeeded in reaching port. The Governor\r\nset sail again, this time on a merchant vessel.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached Virginia, in January, 1637, Harvey could not wait for\r\nthe ship to wend its way up to Jamestown before asserting his authority,\r\nbut landed at Point Comfort and established a temporary capital at\r\nElizabeth City. Here he began immediately to turn sheriffs and justices\r\nout of office and replace them with men more to his liking.[38]\r\nMessengers were sent to summon the Council to meet in the Elizabeth City\r\nchurch. It must have been with an air of triumph that he greeted the\r\nCouncillors, for now the day of retribution had come.\r\n\r\nOne would think that Harvey's expulsion would have taught him a lesson.\r\nInstead, his desire for revenge drove him into new excesses. With the\r\nenlarged powers of his new commission, with the Council submissive to\r\nhis will, with the courts manned by his favorites, with the prestige of\r\nthe King's backing, he went to great extremes. The Reverend Anthony\r\nPanton accused him of \"many arbitrary and illegal proceedings in\r\njudgment, tyranny, extortion.\" The \"unjust whippings, cutting of ears,\r\nfining and confiscation of honest men's goods,\" must have brought back\r\nmemories of Dale and Argall. The converting of fines to his \"own profit\r\nand use,\" or to reward his henchmen, convinced the people that men were\r\naccused and sentenced, not because they were guilty of any crime, but\r\nmerely to have an excuse for taking their property.[39]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, West, Mathews, Utie, and Pierce had been sent as\r\nprisoners to England to answer the charge of mutiny, where a bill was\r\nexhibited against them in the Star Chamber. But here the matter hung\r\nfire. George Donne, Muster General of Virginia and a member of the\r\nCouncil, who had come to England to prosecute them, became ill. Harvey\r\nneglected to put up the money for necessary fees. The great cost of the\r\nvoyage across the Atlantic prevented the sending over of witnesses.\r\n\r\nBut in the absence of the accused men, Sir John took ample revenge on\r\nthem. They were informed by letters from Virginia that \"divers of their\r\ngoods, cattle, and servants\" had been confiscated. So they complained to\r\nthe Privy Council. Mathews assured them that Harvey was bent on ruining\r\nhim, and that he had been heard to say that if one \"stood, tother should\r\nfall, and if he swum, the other should sink.\" He seems to have convinced\r\nthe Privy Council, for on May 25, 1637, they wrote Harvey ordering him\r\nto restore Mathews' property.[40]\r\n\r\nBut so reluctant was Harvey to be cheated out of his revenge that he\r\npostponed compliance in the hope that something might occur to give him\r\nan excuse for not obeying. This excuse he found in a letter from the\r\nPrivy Council expressing satisfaction with his administration. It was\r\nhis excuse, also, for further severities against Mathews. Kemp and\r\nothers entered his house, broke open the doors of several rooms,\r\nransacked his trunks, examined his papers, and carried off a part of his\r\ngoods and eight of his servants.[41]\r\n\r\nWhen word of this reached the Privy Council, the sub-committee to whom\r\nthe case was referred gave it as their opinion that Mathews had been\r\n\"very hardly dealt with.\" \"We cannot but clearly discern somewhat of\r\npassion in the said proceedings,\" they reported. So the Privy Council\r\nwrote again to Harvey, commanding him once more to restore Mathews'\r\nproperty. This time the Governor complied, writing the Privy Council a\r\nlong, but lame excuse for what he had done.[42]\r\n\r\nAnother victim of Harvey's malice was the Reverend Anthony Panton,\r\nminister of the parishes of York and Chiskiack. Panton had quarreled\r\nwith the Governor's warm friend, Secretary Kemp, and had incurred his\r\nlasting enmity by calling him a \"jackanapes,\" who was \"unfit for the\r\nplace of secretary,\" adding that \"his hair-lock was tied up with ribbon\r\nas old as St. Paul's.\" So he was now brought to trial, charged with\r\nmutinous speeches and disobedience to the Governor, and with disrespect\r\nto the Archbishop of Canterbury. The farcical character of justice as\r\nadministered by Harvey is shown by the fact that in the trial Kemp acted\r\nnot only as prosecutor but as one of the judges. Panton's conviction was\r\na matter of course. He was fined L500, forced to make public\r\nsubmission, and was banished from Virginia and forbidden ever to return\r\non pain of death, and authority was given \"to any man whatsoever to\r\nexecute him.\"[43]\r\n\r\nThroughout Virginia colonial history the parties to any dispute who were\r\nin London to urge their side had a great advantage. So Mathews, Utie,\r\nPierce, and Francis Pott, after they secured their liberty under bail,\r\ndevoted their time to undermining Sir John at Court. The Governor\r\ncharged that they planted spies in all parts of the city to invite\r\npersons who had just arrived from Virginia into taverns, treated them to\r\nwine to make them talkative, and got them to state their grievances. So\r\nthey poured out the stories of Harvey's confiscations, extortions,\r\nwhippings, and pressure on the courts of justice.[44]\r\n\r\nAs the evidence against Harvey piled up the exiles gained the support of\r\nthe sub-committee of the Privy Council to whom colonial affairs were\r\nusually referred. Sir John wrote at length to refute what he called \"the\r\nmalicious untruths of such who by all means do go about and study to\r\ntraduce us.\" But in vain, for the Privy Council decided to remove\r\nhim.[45]\r\n\r\nThe shoe was now on the other foot. On January 11, 1639, Sir Francis\r\nWyatt received a commission as Governor of Virginia. When this news\r\nreached the colony there was rejoicing, for Wyatt had shown himself a\r\nstaunch defender of liberty during his previous administration. The\r\npeople could be sure that he would redress their wrongs and see to it\r\nthat justice was done all men. Nor were they disappointed. No sooner had\r\nWyatt arrived than he summoned the General Court and brought Harvey\r\nbefore it to answer for his misdeeds.[46]\r\n\r\nKemp, who was retained as Secretary and Councillor by order of the Privy\r\nCouncil, was helpless to prevent his fellow judges from passing sentence\r\non the deposed Governor. \"They of the old commission have been\r\npersecuted with much malice,\" he wrote in March, 1640, \"the weight\r\nwhereof hath hitherto principally fallen on Sir John Harvey, whose\r\nestate is wholly sequestered at present, and at the next court now\r\napproaching will assuredly be swept away.\"[47] Harvey wrote that he\r\ngroaned under the oppression of his enemies, and that he was so closely\r\nwatched that he hardly had privacy enough to write a letter. His enemies\r\nhad now been advanced to be his judges, and were tearing his estate from\r\nhim by inviting his creditors to clamor against him. Both Harvey and\r\nKemp asked permission to go to England, but this was refused. Not only\r\nwere they held to answer charges, but because the new administration had\r\nno desire to have them clamoring against them at Court.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John being ... laid flat,\" Wyatt next took up the case of Anthony\r\nPanton against Kemp.[48] This matter had been sifted out by the Privy\r\nCouncil, who reported that they could find no proof of the charges\r\nagainst the minister. It seemed strange to them that he should be\r\naccused of mutinous behavior throughout six or seven years, in view of\r\nthe fact that ten months previously Harvey had presented him to a\r\nbenefice. So they suspended the harsh sentence, and referred the matter\r\nto Governor Wyatt. The Virginia court promptly reversed the previous\r\naction, declared Panton guiltless, and restored his estate. So he\r\nreturned in triumph and resumed his duties in his two parishes. To Kemp\r\nthis was the crowning humiliation. \"I am exceedingly injured, and shall\r\nsuffer without guilt unless my friends now assist me,\" he wrote. \"The\r\nGovernor and Council aim at my ruin.\"[49]\r\n\r\nThe men employed to watch Harvey and Kemp must have relaxed their\r\nvigilance, for both escaped and made their way back to England. Thomas\r\nStegg, who aided Kemp in getting away, had to pay dearly, for the\r\nGovernor and Council fined him L50 and imprisoned him. In London, Harvey\r\nand Kemp sought influential friends, poured out their complaints to\r\nthem, and tried to undermine Wyatt at Court. Kemp later returned to\r\nVirginia, where he resumed his place as Secretary, and his seat in the\r\nCouncil. Harvey seems to have given up politics as a bad business and\r\nreturned to the sea as what he probably considered a less dangerous\r\nvocation. He died in 1650.\r\n\r\nThe thrusting out of Sir John Harvey is a landmark in the long struggle\r\nfor self-government in Virginia. It showed that there was a point beyond\r\nwhich no Governor dared go in trampling upon the rights of the people.\r\nIt was a daring thing for the Virginians to defy the King by deposing\r\nthe man he had sent as their Governor, and notifying him in effect that\r\nthey wanted him to make a better selection. That Charles sent Harvey\r\nback and that he was as tyrannical after his return as he had been\r\nbefore, does not obscure the meaning of this uprising as a clash between\r\nthe royal assertion of despotic right and the American devotion to\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nHarvey based his claims to supreme power on the theory that he was the\r\nKing's substitute, and as such should have the unquestioning obedience\r\nof the people. The Virginians contended that his power was limited by\r\nlaw. Even had his rule been marked by justice and moderation, they would\r\nhave denied his pretensions. But when he made them the basis for an\r\nodious tyranny, they took a step unique in American colonial history, by\r\nlaying violent hands on him, and sending him back to his royal master.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] CO1-4, p. 18.\r\n\r\n[2] _Virginia Magazine_ 13: 301.\r\n\r\n[3] E.

The King knew this\r\nyoung man well, for he had been a gentleman usher of the Privy Chamber\r\nunder the Lord Chamberlain, and as such had attended various ceremonies\r\nat Court. He was the fourth son of Maurice Berkeley, of the ancient\r\nBerkeley family of Bruton, Somerset, had studied at Oxford and the\r\nMiddle Temple, and in 1630 had made the \"grand tour\" on the continent.\r\nHe seems to have had thoughts of following in the footsteps of the great\r\nShakespeare, for in 1638 he published a tragedy which he named _The Lost\r\nLady_. He was knighted in 1639.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Charles thought he was doing the Virginians a great favor in\r\nsending them this accomplished young man. But he probably was actuated\r\nalso by less unselfish motives. Berkeley was warmly attached to him,\r\nconsidered his person sacred, defended his claim to rule by divine\r\nright, and considered the Parliamentary leaders who were defying him\r\nenemies of their country. It would be good policy to place such a man in\r\na post of authority in Virginia, to hold the colony in line for the\r\nroyal cause. Sir William too must have had this in mind when he\r\nconsented to lay aside his pen and the pleasures of the Court, to face\r\nthe difficulties and perils of life in the forests of America.\r\n\r\nBut even as he was preparing to leave, the clouds were gathering for the\r\nstorm which broke over England. The long quarrel of King and Parliament\r\nwas nearing a crisis; high churchmen and Puritans were locked in bitter\r\nbattle. In December, 1640, a petition signed by 15,000 persons for the\r\nabolition of Episcopacy \"with all its roots and branches\" was presented\r\nto the Commons. A few months later a bill of attainder against the Earl\r\nof Stafford was passed, and this able statesman and friend of the King\r\nwas led to the block. The Puritans demanded that the Book of Common\r\nPrayer be cast aside. Charles threatened his foes in London by bringing\r\nin soldiers, and men went about their daily tasks under the shadow of\r\nan English Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre. In January, 1642, the King\r\nfled from London and both sides made ready for war.\r\n\r\nBerkeley arrived in Virginia early in 1642. When the Councillors\r\nassembled and took the oath of allegiance and supremacy, they must have\r\nviewed their polished and courtly new Governor with keen interest mixed\r\nwith apprehension. Would he follow the example of Harvey in trying to\r\nrule like an Eastern despot? Would he try to set himself above the law?\r\nWould he take sides in the quarrels which had divided the colony and\r\nresume the persecution of one group or the other?\r\n\r\nBerkeley soon made it evident that he wished to do justice to all men.\r\nIt mattered not whether they had been friends of Harvey or his enemies\r\nso long as they were loyal to the King. So Kemp, Mathews, Menefie, West,\r\nPierce, and others who sat around him at the Council table, had to\r\nstifle old resentments and unite in support of the new administration.\r\n\r\nHarvey had assumed that since the King was absolute and so could do no\r\nwrong, he, as his substitute, could trample on the rights of the people\r\nat will. Berkeley, in contrast, acted on the theory that at a time when\r\nthe Throne itself was in peril, it was his duty to show that under the\r\nroyal authority there could be justice, security, and even freedom.\r\nVirginia had had ten years of experience of his policies when he asked\r\nwhat they could expect from a change of government. \"Is it liberty? The\r\nsun looks not on a people more free than we are from oppression. Is it\r\nwealth? Hundreds of examples show us that industry and thrift in a short\r\ntime may bring us to as high of it as the country and our conditions are\r\ncapable of. Is it security to enjoy this wealth when gotten? Without\r\nblushing I will speak it, I am confident there lives not that person can\r\naccuse me of attempting the least act against any man's property.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that this boast was justified. The\r\nfirst Assembly that sat after Berkeley's arrival spoke of the \"good and\r\nwholesome laws\" that they had passed under his leadership. They were\r\nespecially proud of \"the near approach we have made to the laws and\r\ncustoms of England in proceedings of the court and trials of causes.\"[2]\r\nSo we hear no more of the prosecution of men on trivial charges, of the\r\noverawing of judges, and of ruinous confiscations. Thomas Ludwell,\r\nafter the surrender of the colony to the Commonwealth, when Berkeley's\r\nenemies might easily have hounded him in the courts, declared that there\r\nwas not one man that either publicly or privately charged him with\r\ninjustice.[3]\r\n\r\nIt must have produced a general sense of security when Sir William\r\naffixed his signature to a bill giving either the plaintiff or the\r\ndefendant in any court the right to demand trial by jury. No more could\r\na body of justices, appointed by the Governor, and perhaps looking to\r\nhim for further favors, deprive a man of his property without the\r\njudgment of his peers.[4] And should one be brought before the General\r\nCourt to plead for life or limb, one need not submit to their decision\r\nif unjust, for now, apparently for the first time, appeals were\r\npermitted to the Assembly.[5]\r\n\r\nOne of the chief grievances of former times had been the conscripting of\r\nmen for public service or the service of the Governor. So now when\r\nBerkeley \"in preferring the public freedom before his particular profit\"\r\ngave up any claim to forced labor, he won the gratitude of the people.\r\nHe has restored to us the birthright of our mother nation, men said. No\r\nlonger need the poor planter fear that the sheriff would lead him off to\r\nwork in the Governor's garden while his tobacco field went to weeds, or\r\nthe carpenter curse the day when he was forced to give his time for the\r\nconstruction of a fort.[6]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly admitted that before the arrival of the new Governor they\r\nhad not done their full duty in passing wholesome laws and redressing\r\ngrievances. But they now proudly submitted to the public judgment the\r\nmany benefits to the colony from \"their late consultations.\" Among these\r\nwas the relief given the poor by the revising of the tax law, so as to\r\nmake the levy \"in some measure\" proportionate to \"men's abilities and\r\nestates.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly thought it wise to assert once more that the Governor and\r\nCouncil had no authority to lay taxes.[7] There would seem to have been\r\nno need for this since, though Harvey may have tried to levy taxes on\r\nhis own responsibility, there is no evidence that Berkeley made such an\r\nattempt. It seems likely that the Assembly had no more in mind in\r\nre-enacting this law than the emphasizing of a vital principle.\r\n\r\nBerkeley's liberal policies won something more tangible than the\r\ngratitude of the people, for the Assembly made him a present of two\r\nhouses and an orchard.[8] When the Civil War in England cut off the\r\nGovernor's pension and the allowance granted him by the King, they\r\nlevied a tax of two shillings a tithable to raise a fund for his\r\nsupport. It is true that they did this with grave misgivings. To excuse\r\nthemselves to the people they pointed out that such a thing had never\r\noccurred before from the infancy of the colony, and they prayed God it\r\nwould never happen again. The Assembly promised that when the present\r\ncrisis had passed they would never again consent to place the burden of\r\nmaintaining the Governor upon the people.\r\n\r\nThey seem not to have considered that to do so would be well worth the\r\ncost, since it would make him less dependent on the King and more\r\namenable to their wishes. In the struggle for self-government in the\r\nAmerican colonies nothing tended more to bring victory than the fact the\r\nAssemblies usually were paymasters for the Governors.\r\n\r\nBut now Berkeley had to decide whether it was his duty to remain at his\r\npost in Virginia or whether he should hasten back to England to offer\r\nhis sword to his King. Every vessel which came in brought news of the\r\nbitter conflict which was convulsing the mother country--the battle of\r\nEdgehill, the victory of the Londoners at Turnham Green, the murderous\r\nstruggle in the lanes and ditches of Newbury. Though it seemed that\r\nfinal victory for the royal forces was certain, Berkeley decided that he\r\nwas needed more in England than in Virginia. Turning the government over\r\nto Richard Kemp, he set sail for England early in 1644. We next hear of\r\nhim in the following summer in Cornwall with the King when he was\r\nbearing down on the Parliamentary forces under Essex.\r\n\r\nIt is eloquent of the work done by Berkeley in reconciling the bitter\r\nfactions left by Harvey, that Mathews, Pierce, Menefie, and West seem to\r\nhave accepted Kemp's appointment in good grace. But one wonders whether\r\nKemp, with this dignity, got a new ribbon for his hair lock, and whether\r\nhe patched up his quarrel with the Reverend Anthony Panton. But he was\r\nleft little time for personal matters, for a few weeks after Berkeley's\r\ndeparture the Indians, under the leadership of the aged Opechancanough,\r\nfell on the outer settlements and massacred no less than five hundred\r\npersons.[9]\r\n\r\nEven when this terrible news reached Berkeley he seems to have delayed\r\nhis return, for it was only on June 7, 1645, over a year after the\r\nmassacre, that he arrived at Jamestown.[10] In the meanwhile, the whites\r\nhad taken ample revenge on their treacherous enemies. Expeditions had\r\ngone out to bring fire and destruction to the Indian villages, and to\r\ncut down the ripening corn. No sooner had the Governor set foot on\r\nVirginia soil than he took personal charge of the war, leading out the\r\nforces, exposing himself to danger \"night and day on the water and on\r\nthe land,\" \"visiting the remoter parts and with his presence encouraging\r\nthe people.\" So indefatigable was he that \"he scarce ate or slept to the\r\nhazard of his health.\"[11] At last, when he had captured Opechancanough,\r\nthe disheartened savages sued for peace.[12]\r\n\r\nHaving removed the Indian menace, Sir William was faced with the task of\r\nsaving Virginia for the King. The news from England was\r\nalarming--Parliament was everywhere victorious; the use of the Book of\r\nCommon Prayer was forbidden; hundreds of Anglican clergymen had been\r\nexpelled from their livings; the King had fled to the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nThe Governor knew that there was a powerful faction in the colony,\r\ncomposed chiefly of merchants and Puritans, who favored Parliament. Some\r\nof the merchants had bought plantations in Virginia, entered actively\r\ninto public life, and perhaps held high offices. Thomas Stegg, one of\r\nthe most prominent of them, in 1643 had been Speaker of the House of\r\nBurgesses. Richard Lee, who traded to London, was \"faithful and useful\r\nto the interest of the Commonwealth.\" Richard Bennett adhered to\r\nParliament not only because of his mercantile interests, but because he\r\nwas an ardent Puritan.\r\n\r\nBut the people as a whole were linked by self-interest to whatever\r\ngovernment was in power in England. Virginia's prosperity depended upon\r\ntrade. It was vital to the planters to ship their tobacco abroad and to\r\nget manufactured goods in exchange--cloth, clothing, household\r\nutensils, tools, farm implements, etc. London, the great trading center\r\nof England, was held by the enemies of the King. Even though the Dutch\r\ntook off part of the tobacco crop, if Parliament should prohibit trade\r\nwith the colony the effect might be disastrous. This helps to explain\r\nwhy such a prominent man as Samuel Mathews, who made a good income by\r\nselling beef to victual the English ships, became \"a most deserving\r\nCommonwealth man.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately, Parliament realized that an embargo was a sword that cut\r\nboth ways. At first they tried to bring pressure on the colony by\r\nfreezing their goods in England, but, no doubt at the solicitation of\r\nthe London merchants, in October, 1644, the Commons wrote the Virginia\r\nAssembly that this action had been reversed. Traders hesitated even then\r\nto load their vessels and sail for Virginia, fearing that Berkeley, in\r\nhis rage against Parliament, might have persuaded the Assembly to\r\nexclude them. But they were soon reassured. In February, 1645, the\r\nAssembly passed an act declaring that since \"the great wants and\r\nextremities of the colony\" made it necessary to encourage commerce, free\r\ntrade would be allowed \"to all his Majesty's subjects of England.\"[13]\r\nThey went still further the next year when they thanked the House of\r\nCommons \"for all its favors\" to them.[14]\r\n\r\nYet the planters, not knowing what would come out of the clash of\r\nreligions, political forces, and armies which was convulsing England,\r\ndid all they could to encourage trade with the Dutch. The merchants of\r\nAmsterdam paid well for their tobacco, and sold their wares at figures\r\nwell below those charged by the English. In January, 1649, whereas there\r\nwere only seven vessels from London and two from Bristol trading in the\r\nJames River, there were twelve from the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThough Berkeley had to yield to the Virginia merchants in their demand\r\nthat trade be kept open with the mother country, he was determined to\r\nstamp out Puritanism in the colony. Most Virginians were attached to the\r\nChurch of England; the use of the Book of Common Prayer was almost\r\nuniversal; the ministers adhered to Anglican canonical law. But here and\r\nthere, especially where there were many new arrivals who had been under\r\nthe influence of Calvinist ministers in England, there were pockets of\r\nPuritans.\r\n\r\nMost of the nonconformists were concentrated in southeastern Virginia in\r\nthe counties bordering on Hampton Roads. In May, 1640, the people of the\r\nLower Norfolk County parish elected the Reverend Thomas Harrison their\r\nminister, \"to instruct them concerning their souls' health.\" Apparently\r\nMr. Harrison did not think that the use of the Book of Common Prayer or\r\ncatechising on Sunday afternoons was necessary for the health of their\r\nsouls, for he neglected both.[15]\r\n\r\nTwo years later a group in Upper Norfolk, headed by Richard Bennett,\r\nJohn Hill, and Daniel Gookin, wrote letters to the Elders of Boston,\r\nMassachusetts, bewailing \"their sad condition for the want of the means\r\nof salvation.\" They would be grateful if the Elders would send them\r\nseveral ministers to instruct them in the truth as it is in Jesus. These\r\nletters they intrusted to Mr. Philip Bennett, brother of Richard\r\nBennett, and sent him in a small pinnace on the dangerous voyage to\r\nBoston.[16]\r\n\r\nThe Elders listened with sympathy to this appeal, for they regarded it\r\nas an opportunity \"for enlarging the Kingdom of Christ.\" After much\r\ndeliberation, they selected John Knowles, of Watertown; William\r\nThompson, of Braintree; and Thomas James, of New Haven, and sent them\r\noff. But they had a rough time even before they reached Virginia. No\r\ndoubt they thought it was Satan's effort to thwart them that threw their\r\npinnace on the rocks at the appropriately named Hell Gate. But the\r\nministers, accustomed as they were to getting the better of the Evil\r\nOne, secured another vessel and proceeded on their way.[17]\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival in Virginia they were welcomed by the Puritans. Going\r\nfrom house to house they preached \"openly to the people,\" and \"the\r\nharvest they had was plentiful for the little space of time they were\r\nthere.\" \"It fared with them as it had done before with the Apostles in\r\nthe primitive times that the people magnified them, and their hearts\r\nseemed to be much inflamed with an earnest desire after the Gospel.\"[18]\r\n\r\nBut when Governor Berkeley heard of this invasion of New England\r\ndivines to woo the people from the established Church, his heart too was\r\ninflamed. At the Assembly of March, 1643, he secured a law against\r\nheresy prohibiting ministers to teach or preach publicly or privately\r\nunless they conformed to the orders and constitutions of the Anglican\r\nChurch, and directing the Governor and Council to expel nonconformist\r\nclergymen.[19]\r\n\r\nThe Puritan missionaries to Virginia were less determined than were the\r\nQuakers who sought to convert the people of Massachusetts to their way\r\nof belief and after being expelled returned to face whippings,\r\nmutilation, and the gallows. Upon hearing the order of banishment, they\r\nleft Virginia and did not return.\r\n\r\nBut both Governor Winthrop and Edward Johnson were certain that the\r\nIndian massacre of 1644 was God's punishment of the Virginians for\r\nexpelling his servants. \"Oh! poor Virginia, dost thou send away the\r\nministers of Christ with threatening speeches?\" wrote Johnson in his\r\n_Wonder Working Providence_. \"No sooner is this done but the barbarous,\r\ninhuman, insolent, and bloody Indians are let loose upon them.\"\r\nCertainly a terrible and indiscriminate revenge for a loving Heavenly\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nThough the New Englanders left, Harrison for the time being defied the\r\nlaw by remaining in his parish. Knowing that Cromwell was winning\r\nvictories, he looked to Parliament to protect him. He was elated when he\r\nreceived word that the Commissioners for Plantations had issued a\r\nproclamation in November, 1645, granting freedom of worship in all the\r\ncolonies. \"That golden apple, the ordinance of toleration is now fairly\r\nfallen into the lap of the saints,\" he wrote Winthrop. \"We have received\r\nletters full of life and love from the Earl of Warwick.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThis seems to have given pause to Berkeley, and for two more years\r\nHarrison continued to preach. But by the autumn of 1647 the Governor\r\nseems to have decided to root out Puritanism in defiance of Parliament,\r\nand at his urging the Assembly again ordered all ministers to conform to\r\nthe canons of the Church of England.[21] Under this act Harrison was\r\nbanished. After leaving Virginia he went to Massachusetts, where he\r\nremained two years before going to England.\r\n\r\nHis congregation, which had now grown to 118 persons, appealed to the\r\nCommons, and on October 11, 1649, the Commissioners wrote Governor\r\nBerkeley, ordering him to permit Harrison to return. They had heard that\r\nhe had been banished because he would not use the Book of Common Prayer.\r\n\"You cannot be ignorant that the use of the Common Prayer book is\r\nprohibited by the Parliament.\" By this time Berkeley was so embittered\r\nagainst the Commons that if this letter ever reached him he treated it\r\nwith scorn. After the surrender of the colony to the Commonwealth in\r\n1652, Harrison could have returned had he so desired, but he chose to\r\nremain in England.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Berkeley prosecuted the remaining Puritans. A certain\r\nWilliam Durand who took it upon himself to preach in the Elizabeth River\r\nchapel was arrested, imprisoned, and fined, and severe action was taken\r\nagainst the members of his congregation. Thereupon Durand, Richard\r\nBennett, and many others left the colony and settled in Anne Arundel\r\nCounty, Maryland.[22]\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached Virginia that King Charles had been tried before a\r\nCommission of the Commons, that he had been condemned to death, and that\r\nthe sentence had been carried out at Whitehall and the bleeding head\r\nheld up for the awe-stricken crowds to view, Berkeley was horrified. He\r\nat once proclaimed Charles II King, and so won for Virginia the title of\r\nthe Old Dominion. There was no thought on the Governor's part of\r\nsubmitting to Parliament. The Assembly passed a law making it treason to\r\nquestion the \"undoubted and inherent right of his Majesty ... to the\r\nColony of Virginia.\" To defend the proceedings against the late King was\r\nto become accessory after the act; to asperse his memory was punishable\r\nat the discretion of the Governor and Council; to propose a change of\r\ngovernment was high treason.[23] You should be thankful above all else,\r\nBerkeley said, \"that God has separated you from the guilt of the crying\r\nblood of our pious sovereign of ever blessed memory. But mistake not,\r\ngentlemen, part of it will yet stain your garments if you willingly\r\nsubmit to those murderers' hands that shed it.\"[24]\r\n\r\nParliament countered by declaring the Virginians rebels and by trying\r\nto bring them to terms by economic pressure. In October, 1650, they\r\npassed an act prohibiting all persons \"foreigners and others\" from\r\nhaving commerce or traffic with them. English warships were to be used\r\nto enforce the act, and all commanders were ordered to seize any foreign\r\nvessels found trading with the colony. English ships were not to sail\r\nfor Virginia without a special license from the Council of State.[25]\r\n\r\nThe planters realized fully that if they were cut off from all overseas\r\ncommerce it meant ruin. Their loyalty to the monarchy would be dearly\r\npurchased if their tobacco were left on their hands, and all supplies of\r\ncloth, clothing, and other manufactured goods denied them. Yet under the\r\npassionate urging of Governor Berkeley they remained firm.\r\n\r\nCalling an Assembly for March, 1651, Sir William delivered an address\r\nringing with defiance. You see by the declaration of the men of\r\nWestminster how they mean to deal with you, he said. Surely they could\r\nhave proposed something which might have strengthened us to bear the\r\nheavy chains they are making ready for us, though it were no more than\r\nthe assurance that we shall eat the bread for which our own oxen plow,\r\nand which we reap with our own sweat. \"Surely, gentlemen, we are more\r\nslaves by nature than their power can make us if we suffer ourselves to\r\nbe shaken with these paper bullets.... Gentlemen, by the grace of God we\r\nwill not so tamely part with our King and all those blessings we enjoy\r\nunder him; and if they oppose us do but follow me, I will either lead\r\nyou to victory or lose a life which I cannot more gloriously sacrifice\r\nthan for my loyalty and your security.\"[26]\r\n\r\nWe do not know to what extent the act of 1650 was effective in stopping\r\ntrade to Virginia. It is probable that Dutch merchants continued to come\r\nin, eluding English warships, and taking off a part of the tobacco crop.\r\nHad it not been for this it is probable that the colony would have been\r\nforced to surrender, and it would have been unnecessary for Parliament\r\nto send a force to subdue it.\r\n\r\nDuring the turmoil of the early months of the Commonwealth there was\r\nlittle opportunity for the Council of State to consider what should be\r\ndone about Virginia. But in October, 1649, they directed the Committee\r\nof the Admiralty to recommend steps \"to reduce them to the interest\" of\r\nParliament. This committee called in several merchants interested in the\r\ntobacco trade--Maurice Thompson, Benjamin Worsley, and others--to ask\r\ntheir advice. These men were deeply concerned lest the defection of the\r\ncolonies might ruin them by diverting trade to the Dutch. After long\r\ndebate, it was decided that Parliament should be asked to name\r\ncommissioners \"in whom the government be immediately placed, with power\r\nto settle the same under the government of the Commonwealth.\"[27]\r\n\r\nBut this plan could not be put into effect so long as the Governor and\r\nAssembly were holding out for the King. So when news reached England\r\nthat the blockade had not been successful in bringing them to terms, it\r\nwas decided to send over a naval and military expedition. Thomas Stegg,\r\nwho was in London, no doubt told the Council of State that there were\r\nmany in Virginia who favored the Commonwealth, and that by cooperating\r\nwith them they might take over the colony without firing a shot. So in\r\nnaming a commission to offer terms they included not only Stegg himself,\r\nbut Richard Bennett and William Claiborne, both of whom were in\r\nVirginia. The commission was headed by Captain Robert Dennis. In the\r\nevent of his death, his place was to be filled by Captain Edmund Curtis.\r\n\r\nThey were ordered to \"use their best endeavors\" to bring the Virginians\r\n\"to their due obedience,\" and were authorized to grant pardon to all who\r\nwould submit. In case this did not prove effective they were to use \"all\r\nacts of hostility ... to enforce them.\" They were directed, also, to\r\naugment their force by making recruits in the colony, appointing\r\ncaptains and other officers, and promising freedom to all indentured\r\nworkers who would take up arms for the Commonwealth.[28]\r\n\r\nSo now a fleet of two warships, the _John_ and the _Guinea Frigate_, and\r\na number of armed merchant vessels was assembled, a force of six hundred\r\nmen embarked, and arms and stores brought aboard. Captain Dennis sailed\r\nin the _John_, Captain Curtis in the _Guinea Frigate_. Arriving at\r\nBarbados, and finding a large royalist force ready to resist them, they\r\nlanded their soldiers, and defeated them in a pitched battle. This\r\ncaused a delay of several weeks before they could proceed on their way\r\nto the Chesapeake Bay. But now disaster struck, for off the coast of\r\nCarolina they ran into a storm which sent the _John_ to the bottom,\r\ntaking Captain Dennis and Stegg with her. Unaware of this, the rest of\r\nthe fleet proceeded on their way and arrived safely in Hampton Roads.\r\n\r\nEven without the _John_ the fleet must have seemed formidable to the\r\nplanters who paused in their work to view it. It must have seemed\r\nformidable, also, to Governor Berkeley. But he was determined to resist\r\nto the end. For months he had done all in his power to create hatred of\r\nthe Commonwealth leaders, calling them bloody tyrants, and accusing them\r\nof planning to restore the old London Company. The Anglican ministers,\r\nhurling invectives from the pulpit, \"stirred up the people in all\r\nplaces.\" At the gatherings for the sessions of the county courts, in\r\ntaverns, in churchyards after services, everywhere when two or more men\r\ncame together \"little else was spoken of.\"[29]\r\n\r\nWith the enemy in Virginia waters and with messengers riding through the\r\ncounties to summon men to the colors, the planter dropped the hoe to\r\nfasten on the helmet and the breastplate, and take up the fusil, the\r\nsword, the halberd, and the pistol. Embarking on shallops, or trudging\r\nthrough the woods and fields the trained bands converged on Jamestown\r\nuntil there were between a thousand and twelve hundred men there ready\r\nto defend the little capital.[30]\r\n\r\nBut there was no battle. With the loss of Dennis and Stegg, Curtis,\r\nBennett, and Claiborne alone were left of the Parliamentary\r\ncommissioners. Since Curtis could be outvoted by the other two, the\r\nfinal settlement was left to all intents and purposes in the hands of\r\nthe two Virginians. We do not know how Curtis got in touch with them,\r\nbut they seem to have come aboard the _Guinea Frigate_ to receive their\r\ninstructions. When they opened them and realized how great was their\r\nresponsibility, they made up their minds to use every effort to spare\r\nthe colony the horrors of civil war.[31]\r\n\r\nTheir first step was to distribute papers among the people refuting\r\nBerkeley's charges that Parliament meant to enslave them, which they\r\nsubstantiated by copies of private letters. Then, hearing that a\r\ncouncil of war was in session at Jamestown, they sent up a summons to\r\nthe Governor and Council to surrender. At the same time, although they\r\nthought their force inadequate to defeat the Virginians, they set sail\r\nup the James River.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Governor and Council had been considering their\r\nsummons. One wishes a record had been kept of that stormy debate, with\r\nBerkeley pleading for resistance to the end, and others pointing out\r\nthat this meant ruin. In the end they sent a reply which reached the\r\nfleet on its way up the river, promising to yield if the government were\r\nleft in their hands for one more year. The commissioners replied with a\r\nconciliatory message, which though refusing this compromise, \"produced\r\nthe calling of an Assembly.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses fully realized the folly of defying the might of England.\r\nShould they succeed in driving off the forces facing them, other and\r\nmore powerful armies would follow. So they sat \"in contemplation of the\r\ngreat miseries and certain destruction which were so nearly hovering\r\nover this whole country.\" When they heard the remarkably liberal terms\r\noffered by the commissioners, they yielded.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that Virginia should \"be in due obedience and subjection\r\nto the Commonwealth of England.\" But following this one vital provision\r\ncame a series of concessions to the colony. The surrender was to be\r\nconsidered voluntary and not forced by conquest, the Assembly was to be\r\ncontinued, pardon was granted for words and writings denouncing\r\nParliament, Virginia was to be \"free from all taxes, customs, and\r\nimpositions whatsoever,\" a provision which Parliament might with profit\r\nhave remembered over a century later when they were debating the Stamp\r\nAct. The recognized principle that within the colony the Assembly alone\r\nhad the right to tax was now for the first time guaranteed.[33]\r\n\r\nThen followed two provisions in which the commissioners stretched their\r\ninstructions to the limit. There can be no doubt that it was Claiborne\r\nwho was largely responsible for the promise that \"Virginia shall have\r\nand enjoy the ancient bounds and limits granted by the charters of the\r\nformer Kings,\" for this meant that Maryland would once more become a\r\npart of Virginia. But it remained to be seen whether Parliament would\r\nratify so drastic a measure. And when it was stipulated that the colony\r\nshould have \"free trade as the people of England do to all places and\r\nwith all nations according to the laws of that Commonwealth,\" it was\r\nobvious that there would be strenuous opposition from the merchants of\r\nLondon and Bristol.\r\n\r\nHaving affixed their signatures to these articles, the commissioners\r\nhastened on to Maryland to demand the surrender of that colony. But\r\nbefore sailing they called for election for a new House of Burgesses.\r\nWith Berkeley no longer in power to urge the return of staunch\r\nloyalists, and with Virginia submissive to the Commonwealth, the\r\npersonnel of the House was greatly changed. When they met at Jamestown\r\non April 30, 1652, one recognized only six familiar faces.[34] In the\r\nmeanwhile, Bennett and Claiborne, who had returned from Maryland, sat\r\nwith them in what was in reality a constitutional convention.\r\n\r\nTheir first act was to elect Bennett Governor for one year. Thus, by one\r\nof those strange turns of the wheel of fortune, this ardent Puritan who\r\na few years before had been driven into exile because of his religious\r\nbeliefs, was placed at the head of the government. Had he been a man of\r\nSir John Harvey's disposition, he might now have taken his revenge. But\r\nthere is no evidence that he bore malice against Berkeley and the former\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses next elected Claiborne Secretary of State \"to be next in\r\nplace to the Governor.\" Then followed the election of a new Council. It\r\nis proof of the spirit of reconciliation which prevailed that most of\r\nthe former members were chosen. But the Burgesses made it clear that the\r\nAssembly was to be the ruling power in the colony. They were to appoint\r\nthe Governor and Council, who were to exercise only such powers as the\r\nAssembly delegated to them. And they immediately took from them the\r\ncontrol of local government by themselves selecting the county\r\njustices.[35]\r\n\r\nThus was self-government established in the colony. In England the clash\r\nof arms and the struggle of class and religious groups resulted, not in\r\nestablishing a republic, but only in exchanging one despot for another.\r\nBut though Virginia had played but an insignificant role in the great\r\ndrama, she reaped a full reward. For the next eight years it was the\r\npeople who ruled through their representatives in the House of\r\nBurgesses.\r\n\r\nAnd the people, most of them at heart still loyal to the monarchy, would\r\ntolerate no persecution of the King's friends. Berkeley and some of the\r\nCouncillors, thinking that life under the new government would be\r\nunendurable, had stipulated in the articles that they be permitted to\r\nleave the colony and take their property with them. In July, 1653,\r\nBerkeley was still planning to leave. Yet neither he nor any of the\r\nothers seem to have done so, contenting themselves with sending Colonel\r\nFrancis Lovelace to Europe to attest to the exiled Prince Charles their\r\ncontinued loyalty. Only when some ardent royalist could not bridle his\r\ntongue were severe penalties inflicted. We have an example of this in\r\nNorthumberland County when a Mr. Calvert had to pay one thousand pounds\r\nof tobacco to save his wife from thirty lashes on her shoulders for\r\nstigmatizing \"the keepers of the liberty of England as rogues, traitors,\r\nand rebels.\"[36]\r\n\r\nNor was there any persecution of Church of England men in retaliation\r\nfor the expulsion of Puritans under Berkeley. There seems to have been\r\nno thought of prohibiting the use of the Book of Common Prayer, no\r\nthought of turning Anglican ministers out of their cures. In fact the\r\nBurgesses were so deeply concerned at the many complaints of vacant\r\npulpits that they offered a reward of L20 to anyone bringing over a\r\nclergyman.[37]\r\n\r\nThough Puritans and Anglicans, Commonwealth men and royalists lived\r\ntogether in peace, there was friction between the English merchants and\r\nthe planters. The former argued that the act of 1650, which prohibited\r\nforeign ships from trading with the colonies, was still in force. The\r\nlatter claimed that the law had been temporary in character and was now\r\ninvalid. And they pointed out that the articles of surrender had\r\npromised them free trade with all nations. So when a Dutch merchant\r\nvessel came into the James or the York, they gladly loaded her with\r\ntobacco and accepted the cheap goods of Amsterdam in exchange.\r\n\r\nBut the situation changed when England became involved in war with the\r\nNetherlands. In the summer of 1653, when the _Leopolus_, a merchantman\r\nof Dunkirk, came into the Elizabeth River, the captains of two English\r\nships came on board to demand her special license. Apparently the master\r\nhad no license, for the vessel was seized by the Virginia authorities\r\nand sold for L400.[38]\r\n\r\nAfter this there seem to have been no further seizures by the\r\nVirginians. But the English masters took it upon themselves to try to\r\nbreak up the Dutch trade, and the planters looked on helplessly as they\r\nintercepted sloops taking their tobacco to the Dutch vessels, or seized\r\nthe vessels themselves and took them off as prizes. In 1660 the Assembly\r\nplucked up courage to declare that \"the Dutch and all strangers of what\r\nChristian nation soever in amity with the people of England shall have\r\nfree liberty to trade with us.\" And they required the masters of all\r\nincoming English ships to give bond not to molest any vessels whatsoever\r\nin Virginia waters.[39]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that during the entire Commonwealth period the trade with\r\nHolland was kept open. In 1655 certain English shipowners complained\r\nthat \"there are usually found intruding upon the plantation divers\r\nships, surreptitiously carrying away the growth thereof to foreign\r\nparts.\"[40] It was this which widened the market for tobacco, kept up\r\nthe price, and brought a degree of prosperity to the colony.\r\n\r\nWith the articles of surrender stipulating that Virginia should have its\r\noriginal bounds, it seemed a golden opportunity for the colony to regain\r\nthe territory granted to Lord Baltimore. Surely the Puritan government\r\nof England would be eager to root out the group of Roman Catholics in\r\nMaryland. So when the Assembly sent Samuel Mathews to have the articles\r\nratified they instructed him to plead for the annulling of Baltimore's\r\npatent. But Baltimore had cut the ground from under their feet by\r\nrecognizing the Commonwealth as early as 1648, appointing a Puritan\r\nGovernor of Maryland, and proclaiming religious freedom. Though Richard\r\nBennett came over to join Mathews in defending Virginia's claim, the\r\nfinal settlement left Maryland a separate colony.[41]\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia watched with intense interest the dramatic events\r\nin England in the years from 1652 to the restoration of the monarchy in\r\n1660--the dissolution of the Rump Parliament, the election of the\r\nPraise-God Barebone Parliament, the naming of Cromwell Protector, the\r\nforeign wars, the death of Cromwell, the brief rule of Richard Cromwell.\r\nBut they were less affected by them than by happenings in the mother\r\ncountry at any other time during the colonial period. Virginia was left\r\nto her own devices because the men in power in London were too greatly\r\noccupied with other matters to bother with her. One wonders whether they\r\nknew what was going on, for the correspondence with persons in the\r\ncolony dwindled to a trickle.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 1658, a group of merchants trading to Virginia wrote the\r\nCouncil of State complaining of \"the loose and distracted condition of\r\nthat colony.\" It seems that Cromwell had already been considering\r\ncertain proposals \"for supplying that defect,\" but before he could come\r\nto any decision he died.\r\n\r\nThus the people of Virginia were left to make a most interesting\r\nexperiment in self-government. The House of Burgesses were elected on a\r\nbroad franchise. Under the law of 1655 all housekeepers were given the\r\nright to vote.[42] Since it would seem that everyone must have a place\r\nin which to live, this was a near approach to manhood suffrage. Yet\r\nthree years later these liberty loving people made certain that no one\r\nshould be excluded, when the Assembly enacted that \"all persons\r\ninhabiting in this colony that are freemen\" were \"to have their votes in\r\nthe election of Burgesses.\"[43] One wonders whether Edmund Pendleton,\r\nGeorge Mason, Patrick Henry, James Madison, and other members of the\r\nVirginia Convention of 1776, who voted that only freeholders should\r\nvote, realized that they were less advanced on the road to democracy\r\nthan their ancestors over a century before.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1652 gave the right to elect \"all the officers of this\r\ncolony\" to \"the Burgesses, the representatives of the people.\" However,\r\nit seems to have been Cromwell's intention to assume the power of\r\nappointing the Governor, for in December, 1653, his Highness \"thought\r\nfit to continue Colonel Bennett\" in that office until he should \"further\r\nsignify his pleasure.\"[44] But when he did nothing more about it, in\r\nMarch, 1655, the Burgesses elected Edward Digges Governor. Three years\r\nlater, they chose Samuel Mathews, who continued in office until his\r\ndeath in January, 1660.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Council for some years accepted with good grace the\r\nsubordinate position accorded them. But in 1658 they made an effort to\r\nregain some of the powers they had held prior to the surrender to the\r\nCommonwealth. When the Assembly of that year were concluding their\r\nproceedings, they voted not to be dissolved, but merely to adjourn. But\r\nthe Governor and Council \"for many important causes\" took it on\r\nthemselves to override this decision and declare the Assembly dissolved.\r\n\r\nWhen this message was received by the House, some of the members started\r\nfor the door. But they probably sat down hastily when a resolution was\r\npassed that if any Burgess showed his acceptance of the dissolution by\r\nleaving, he was to be censured \"as a person betraying the trust reposed\r\nin him by the country.\" They then sent a message to the Governor and\r\nCouncil declaring their action illegal and demanding that they revoke\r\nthe dissolution. To this the Governor and Council replied that they were\r\nwilling for the Assembly to continue provided they bring their work to a\r\nspeedy conclusion. As for the \"dispute of the power of dissolving and\r\nthe legality thereof\" they suggested that it be referred to the Lord\r\nProtector.[45]\r\n\r\nBut the House was now thoroughly aroused, and was determined to bring\r\nthe matter to an issue. So they appointed a committee to draw up a\r\nreport for the \"manifestation and vindication of the Assembly's power.\"\r\nThis committee proposed resolutions declaring the \"power of government\r\nto reside in such persons as shall be impowered by the Burgesses (the\r\nrepresentatives of the people) who are not dissolvable by any power now\r\nextant in Virginia but the House of Burgesses.\" They also recommended\r\nthe immediate dismissal of the Councillors. Accordingly the House\r\npreceded to recall both Governor and Council. Apparently the Burgesses\r\ndid not blame Governor Mathews for the crisis for they at once\r\nre-elected him, and then asked him to make recommendations for the new\r\nCouncil. It is probable that they thought Nathaniel Bacon and Francis\r\nWillis responsible for the attempted dissolution, for they were the\r\nonly Councillors who had signed the offensive order who were not\r\nre-elected.[46]\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly met again, in March, 1659, a letter was laid before\r\nthem from Henry Lawrence, President of the Council of State in England,\r\nannouncing the death of Cromwell and the accession of Richard Cromwell\r\nas Lord Protector. The government of Virginia was being studied by the\r\nCouncil, he reported, and they soon would have some positive orders. In\r\nthe meanwhile, they directed the Governor and Council to apply\r\nthemselves to the \"management of the affairs of that colony.\"[47]\r\n\r\nWhen this letter was read to the Burgesses, they must have looked at\r\neach other in dismay. Did this mean that the Governor and Council\r\nthereafter were to derive their powers, not from the House, but from\r\nEngland? They at once acknowledged the new Lord Protector, but they\r\nrequested the Governor to join with them in petitioning him to confirm\r\ntheir privileges.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting to hear from England they decided to make important\r\nconcessions. Mathews was to be Governor for two years, at the expiration\r\nof which time the Assembly would choose one of the Councillors to\r\nsucceed him. Members of the Council were to serve for life, \"except in\r\ncase of high misdemeanors.\" The Governor was to nominate Councillors,\r\nbut the Burgesses were to have the privilege of confirming or rejecting.\r\nThe Council at first assented to these changes until further directions\r\nfrom England, but later \"they expressly declined the said act,\" and\r\ndeclared the Assembly dissolved.[48] It would seem that from March,\r\n1659, to March, 1660, the Governor and Council claimed that they derived\r\ntheir authority, not from the Burgesses, but from the Council of State.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the people waited anxiously for news from England.\r\nWould the weak Richard Cromwell, Thumbledown Dick as he was called in\r\ncontempt, gain a firm grasp on the reins of state? Or would there be\r\nanarchy? Or would Prince Charles be summoned from exile and placed on\r\nthe throne of his fathers? When the tobacco fleet drifted in, the word\r\nthey brought was alarming. Richard Cromwell had been forced to resign;\r\nEngland was subjected to the weak but violent rule of soldiers; a new\r\ncivil war threatened. \"Swordsmen bear the rule of the nation,\" a London\r\nmerchant wrote his father in Virginia in December, 1659. \"The soldiers\r\nthey are divided one against another, and the people they are divided,\r\nsome for one government some for another, and how long thus a kingdom\r\ndivided against itself can stand, I know not.\"[49]\r\n\r\nTo make matters still more uncertain for the Virginians, in January,\r\n1660, Governor Mathews died. When the summons was sent out for the\r\nAssembly to meet, the Burgesses straggled in to the little capital, some\r\non horseback, some by boat. Little knots must have gathered on the green\r\nto discuss the distractions in the mother country, and their meaning for\r\nthe future of Virginia.\r\n\r\nWhen they had crowded into the house where they were to meet, and had\r\ntaken seats, their first step was to reassert their authority \"as the\r\nsupreme power in this country.\"[50] Then they took a step which for\r\nthree centuries has puzzled historians--they elected Sir William\r\nBerkeley Governor. That this decision was made at the opening of the\r\nsession would lead us to believe that it reflected the general sentiment\r\nof the people. They had had experience of Berkeley's energy, concern for\r\nthe welfare of the colony, refusal to use the courts for personal gain.\r\nCertainly this is the view he himself took of his election. \"In\r\nconsideration of the service I had done the country in defending them\r\nand destroying great numbers of Indians ... and in view of the equal\r\njustice I had distributed to all men, not only the Assembly but the\r\nunanimous votes of all the country made me Governor.\"[51]\r\n\r\nIt is possible, also, that the Assembly had in mind the possibility that\r\nthe monarchy might be restored. Their action came just nine weeks before\r\nCharles II set foot on English soil at Dover amid the cheers of the\r\ncrowds on the beach. The word may have gone from plantation to\r\nplantation that it would please Charles and recommend the colony to his\r\nfavor to know that they had made choice of the former royal Governor, a\r\nman noted for his devotion to his father and himself.\r\n\r\nYet the Assembly made it clear that Sir William would hold office from\r\nthem as the supreme power in the colony. They stipulated that he must\r\ncall an Assembly at least once in every two years, that he should not\r\ndissolve the Assembly without permission from the House, and that in\r\nappointing members of the Council he must have their approbation.\r\n\r\nBerkeley hesitated. Appearing before the Assembly he expressed his\r\ngratitude for the honor done him, and protested that there were many\r\namong them who were \"more sufficient for it\" than he. When he first came\r\nto Virginia, he said, he had a commission from his \"most gracious master\r\nKing Charles of ever blessed memory.\" When the King was put to death,\r\nhis son sent him another commission to govern Virginia, but Parliament\r\nsent a force against him, and finding him defenceless, took over the\r\ncolony. But Parliament continued not long, and now his intelligence was\r\nnot enough to tell him who or what ruled England. \"But, Mr. Speaker, it\r\nis one duty to live obedient to a government, and another of a very\r\ndifferent nature to command under it.\" Yet when he had asked the Council\r\nfor their advice, and they had concurred unanimously in his election, he\r\nconsented.[52]\r\n\r\nThus this professed enemy of republican principles became the head of a\r\nsemi-independent little republic. To Governor Stuyvesant, of New\r\nNetherlands, he wrote: \"I am but a servant of the Assembly, neither do\r\nthey arrogate any power to themselves further than the miserable\r\ndistractions of England force them to. For when God shall be pleased in\r\nhis mercy to take away and dissipate the unnatural division of their\r\nnative country, they will immediately return to their own professed\r\nobedience.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThough Charles was proclaimed King in England on May 8, 1660, it was\r\nonly in September that the slow moving vessels of the day brought the\r\nnews to Virginia. It was with elation that Berkeley wrote to the\r\nsheriffs in every county that God had invested \"our most gracious\r\nsovereign, Charles II,\" with the \"just rights of his royal father,\" and\r\ncharged them to proclaim him King forthwith. In Jamestown there was\r\nrejoicing, marked by the firing of cannon, and the blare of trumpets.\r\nThe country people for miles around must have flocked in to aid in\r\nmaking way with six cases of drams and a hundred and seventy-six gallons\r\nof cider.[54]\r\n\r\nBerkeley's joy was tempered with the fear that the King might be angry\r\nwith him for having accepted office from the \"rebel\" Assembly. But\r\nCharles reassured him, and sent him a new commission. Overjoyed,\r\nBerkeley replied: \"I ... do most humbly throw myself at your Majesty's\r\nfeet ... that you yet think me worthy of your royal commands. It is true\r\n... I did something, which if misrepresented to your Majesty, may cause\r\nyour Majesty to think me guilty of a weakness I should ever abhor myself\r\nfor. But it was no more ... than to leap over the fold to save your\r\nMajesty's flock, when your Majesty's enemies of that fold had barred up\r\nthe lawful entrance to it, and enclosed the wolves of schism and\r\nrebellion ready to devour all within.\"[55]\r\n\r\nThus the Commonwealth period in Virginia came to an end. No longer was\r\nthe Assembly to be the supreme power, selecting the Governor and\r\nCouncil, and controlling local government. The old struggle for\r\nself-government had to be resumed; the representatives of the people\r\nagain had to steel themselves against the encroachments of arbitrary\r\nKings and arbitrary Governors. More than a century was to elapse before\r\nthe rights surrendered when Charles II was proclaimed were regained.\r\n\r\nBut the training in self-government received during the eight years that\r\nthe people were their own masters stood them in good stead in the\r\nconflicts ahead. Having tasted the sweets of freedom, they were ready to\r\nresist when Governors vetoed their bills, or corrupted the Burgesses, or\r\nswayed the courts, or bullied the Council. The Commonwealth period\r\nforeshadowed Bacon's Rebellion and the American Revolution; the\r\nconstitutional Assembly of 1652 foreshadowed Bacon's Assembly of June,\r\n1676, and the Virginia Convention of 1776.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Virginia Magazine_ 1: 77.\r\n\r\n[2] W.

A BACON!\r\n\r\n\r\nSir William Berkeley was one of the best Governors in the history of\r\ncolonial Virginia during his first administration; during his second he\r\nwas one of the worst. The man who had won the gratitude of the people by\r\nhis respect for their rights, his refusal to use the courts to further\r\nhis own interests, his efforts to bring prosperity, was followed by\r\ntheir bitter curses when he left Virginia in 1677. The courtly young\r\ngentleman who had exchanged the Court of Charles I for the forests and\r\ntobacco fields of the colony, had become the crabbed, dictatorial old\r\nman. In 1672 the Quaker preacher, William Edmundson, visited him to\r\nintercede for the Society of Friends. The next day Richard Bennett asked\r\nEdmundson whether the Governor had called him dog, rogue, etc. \"No,\" he\r\nreplied. \"Then you took him in his best humor.\"[1]\r\n\r\nOne of Sir William's worst traits, his greed, grew on him with the\r\nyears. \"Though ambition commonly leaves old age, covetousness does not,\"\r\nhe wrote Lord Arlington. It may have been this which made him marry\r\nFrances Culpeper, the widow of Captain Samuel Stephens, who brought him\r\na large estate. Though there was nothing wrong in this, it was whispered\r\nthrough the colony that it was the marrying of a young wife which was\r\nresponsible for Berkeley's \"old follyage.\" Frances seems to have been\r\nloyal to him amid the troubles which soon followed, even though she may\r\nhave cast tender eyes on Philip Ludwell, whom she married after Sir\r\nWilliam's death.\r\n\r\nWhatever is the explanation of the change in Berkeley's character, it\r\nobviously was the Civil War in England, the execution of Charles I, and\r\nthe turmoil of the Commonwealth period which intensified his distrust of\r\nrepublican institutions. They had been tried and the experiment had\r\nended in disastrous failure. True, he had been a witness of the success\r\nof self-government in Virginia, but this did not change his views.\r\nMonarchy was the form of government ordained by God. In Virginia it was\r\nhe, as the King's representative, who should rule. So he was determined\r\nthat there should be no more republicanism in the colony than his\r\ninstructions required.\r\n\r\nBerkeley did not attempt the barefaced disregard of law practiced by\r\nHarvey. His methods were more subtile. He sought to make men obedient to\r\nhis will by holding out to them offices of profit or honor. The people\r\nof Charles City County complained that Sir William, \"aspiring to a sole\r\nand absolute power over us ... greatly neglecting the Council ... did\r\ntake upon him the sole naming and appointing of other persons in their\r\nroom and place such as himself best liked and thought fittest for his\r\npurposes.\"[2] The men who sat around the Council table with him might\r\nperhaps venture an opinion now and then, but they dared not arouse his\r\nbrittle temper by opposing him when once he had made up his mind. To do\r\nso might lose one a collector's place, or a colonelship in the militia,\r\nor even one's seat on the Council.\r\n\r\nThe situation in the House of Burgesses was similar. Berkeley was\r\nshameless in corrupting the representatives of the people by handing out\r\njobs. It was testified that he took on himself the sole appointment of\r\nall officers, military as well as civil. Offices were created merely \"to\r\nincrease the number of his party ... all which offices he bestowed on\r\nsuch persons, how unfit or unskilful soever, he conceived would be most\r\nfor his designs.\" Thus, by a skilful use of the patronage, he so gained\r\nupon and obliged all or the greatest number of men of parts and estates\r\n\"as to ... do whatsoever he pleased.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIf a Burgess voted as Sir William wished, he could count on perhaps a\r\nsheriff's place, perhaps a collector's place, almost certainly a\r\ncommission in the militia. If the Burgesses of 1666 wore their uniforms\r\nwhen they took their seats, the session must have assumed a military\r\naspect, for, of the thirty who attended, six were colonels, two\r\nlieutenant colonels, one major, and fourteen captains.\r\n\r\nHaving in this way made a majority of the Burgesses subservient to his\r\nwill, Berkeley used his right of prorogation to retain them\r\nindefinitely. In this bit of political strategy he could justify himself\r\nwith the thought that he had the example of his royal master. The Long\r\nAssembly of Virginia was the counterpart of the Long Parliament of\r\nEngland. For sixteen years he refused to hold a general election, and\r\nhe probably congratulated himself that in the colony there was but a\r\nmockery of self-government. The Burgesses might betray the interests of\r\nthe people with impunity; they could not be made to answer at the polls.\r\nSo it was with bitterness that the people paid their taxes for the\r\nsalaries of men over whom they had no control. The people of Charles\r\nCity County complained that their representatives had been \"overswayed\r\nby the power and prevalency\" of Berkeley and his Council, and had\r\nneglected their grievances.[4]\r\n\r\nAs Sir William was supreme in the Assembly, so he was supreme in local\r\ngovernment. The justices of the county courts were his appointees. The\r\nwell-paid sheriffs' office, which he made the stepping stone to the\r\nHouse of Burgesses, was his to fill. So the county courts, in exercising\r\ntheir judicial, legislative, and executive powers, dared not act\r\ncontrary to his will.\r\n\r\nBerkeley had prided himself on having won the affection of the people in\r\nhis first administration. One wonders whether he realized that this\r\naffection was turning to hatred. Nathaniel Bacon accused him of\r\nenriching a few favorites at the expense of the people, and of glaring\r\ninjustice to individual men. \"All the power and sway is got into the\r\nhands of the rich, who by extortious advantages ... have curbed and\r\noppressed them in all manner of ways,\" Bacon wrote in a fiery\r\nmanifesto.[5] The constant breach of laws, unjust prosecutions, excuses,\r\nand evasions, showed that the men in power were running the government\r\n\"as if it were but to play a booty, game, or divide a spoil.\" Nor was\r\nthere any hope of redress, for to lay the people's grievances before the\r\nHouse of Burgesses was to appeal \"to the very persons our complaints do\r\naccuse.\"[6]\r\n\r\nSome of the Burgesses, as well as the members of the Council, could\r\nexpect large grants of land if they were in the Governor's good graces.\r\n\"Some take up 2,000 acres, some 3,000, and others 10,000, and many more\r\nhave taken up 30,000,\" it was said. Unable to cultivate such vast\r\ntracts, they merely built little shacks, or perhaps \"hog houses\" on them\r\nso as not to forfeit the deed. When the soil of the little farms of the\r\npoor began to wear out, or when new settlers arrived, the only\r\navailable land was on the frontier. Here they made a precarious living\r\non \"barren lands\" where they were in constant danger from the\r\nIndians.[7]\r\n\r\nBut the most urgent complaint was of the heavy load of taxes. When the\r\nsheriff came to the poor planter to demand a part of his little crop of\r\ntobacco, he wanted to know to what use it would be put. He knew that a\r\ngoodly share went to Governor Berkeley, some to the Councillors, some to\r\npay the salaries of the Burgesses, but much was not accounted for. When\r\nthe members of the county courts retired into a private room to lay the\r\nlocal levy, there were angry murmurs of fraud. Of course they will not\r\ntell us what the taxes are for, because part of the money they put in\r\ntheir own pockets, it was said.\r\n\r\nBacon echoed these charges. \"See what sponges have sucked up the public\r\nwealth, and whether it hath not been privately contrived away by\r\nunworthy favorites, by vile juggling parasites whose tottering fortunes\r\nhave been repaired and supported.\"[8] And the small farmer cursed as\r\nLady Berkeley drove by in her coach, or when they viewed the Governor's\r\nwide acres, his six houses, his four hundred cattle, his great flock of\r\nsheep, his sixty horses, his well-filled barns. Few had ever seen his\r\ncostly plate, but its fame must have been spread abroad.[9]\r\n\r\nBerkeley was accused of using the courts to punish his enemies and\r\nreward his favorites. A manifesto entitled \"Declaration of the People,\"\r\nsaid that he had \"rendered contemptible the magistrates of justice by\r\nadvancing to places of judicature scandalous and ignorant favorites.\"\r\nColonel Henry Norwood wrote Secretary Williamson in 1667 that great\r\ninjury had been done in the courts \"by the insinuation of some that make\r\nadvantages of the Governor's passion, age, and weakness.\" It was a\r\ngrievance, he said, that in the Assembly the chairman of the committee\r\nto consider appeals from the county courts was usually a member of the\r\nCouncil.[10]\r\n\r\nBerkeley vowed that he knew of nothing in which he had not distributed\r\nequal justice to all men, but there is reason to think that he did use\r\nthe courts to further his own interests. Thomas Mathew states that he\r\ncheated Thomas Lawrence out of \"a considerable estate on behalf of a\r\ncorrupt favorite,\" and we know that Lawrence never forgave him. William\r\nDrummond was another who had a personal grievance and it was his efforts\r\nto gain revenge which drove the Governor to such acts of savage cruelty\r\nwhen he had him in his power.\r\n\r\nThough Berkeley may have been indifferent to the rights of others, he\r\nwas quick to complain when his own interests were concerned. He had been\r\neloquent in denouncing the restrictions on the trade of Virginia under\r\nthe Commonwealth, and now he was greatly concerned when his adored\r\nCharles II gave his assent to even more stringent acts. All goods sent\r\nto the colonies, even though of foreign growth or manufacture, must come\r\nby way of England; all tobacco, sugar, wool, etc., produced in the\r\ncolonies must be shipped to England or her dominions.[11]\r\n\r\nThe results for Virginia were disastrous. The Dutch traders had paid\r\nthree pence a pound for tobacco; the English merchants now offered a\r\nhalf penny or in some cases only a farthing. The mass of the people were\r\nreduced to poverty and rags. Secretary Ludwell reported that when the\r\nsmall planter had paid his taxes, very little remained for him for the\r\nsupport of his family. \"So much too little that I can attribute it to\r\nnothing but the mercy of God that he has not fallen into mutiny and\r\nconfusion.\"[12] Nine years later Ludwell had occasion to remember these\r\nwords when the poor did fall into mutiny and confusion.\r\n\r\nBerkeley sailed for England in May, 1661, where no doubt he talked with\r\nhis brother Lord John Berkeley in an effort to have the Navigation Acts\r\nrepealed. But he had no success. The fault is your own, he was told.\r\nStop planting so much tobacco and produce the more useful commodities\r\nneeded by England. Send us masts for our ships, flax for our linen, hemp\r\nfor our ropewalks, potash for our woolens.[13]\r\n\r\nBerkeley made a sincere effort to turn the colony to the production of\r\ncommodities other than tobacco, but all his experiments ended in\r\nfailure. Ten years later, when the Lords of Trade asked him what\r\nimpediments there existed to trade, he blurted out: \"Mighty and\r\ndestructive by that severe act of Parliament which excludes us from\r\nhaving any commerce with any nation in Europe but our own.... If this\r\nwere for his Majesty's service or the good of his subjects we should\r\nnot repine, whatever our sufferings are for it. But on my soul it is\r\ncontrary to both.\"[14]\r\n\r\nNot only did the Navigation Acts impoverish Virginia, but they brought\r\nadditional disaster to the people by provoking the Dutch to war. In 1667\r\na fleet of five Dutch warships entered the Chesapeake Bay. The crew of\r\nthe English frigate _Elizabeth_, not suspecting danger, had careened her\r\nto clean her bottom. So they had to stand by helpless as the enemy moved\r\nup and captured her. The Dutch then turned on the tobacco fleet and took\r\ntwenty vessels.[15] In a second Dutch war a desperate engagement was\r\nfought off Lynhaven Bay. Nine or ten of the tobacco ships, in their\r\nhaste to get away, ran aground and were taken.[16]\r\n\r\nHad Edward Johnson been in Virginia in the year 1667, he would have been\r\nsure that the series of misfortunes which befell the colony came as a\r\nsign of God's anger. \"This poor, poor country ... is now reduced to a\r\nvery miserable condition,\" Thomas Ludwell wrote Lord John Berkeley. \"In\r\nApril ... we had a most prodigious storm of hail, many of them as big as\r\nturkey eggs, which destroyed most of our young mast and cattle.... But\r\non the 27th of August followed the most dreadful hurricane that ever the\r\ncolony groaned under.... The night of it was the most dismal time that\r\never I knew or heard of, for the wind and rain raised so confused a\r\nnoise, mixed with the continual cracks of falling houses.... But when\r\nthe morning came and the sun risen it would have comforted us after such\r\na night, had it not lighted us to the ruins of our plantations, of which\r\nI think not one escaped. The nearest computation is at least 10,000\r\nhouses blown down, all the Indian grain laid flat on the ground, all the\r\ntobacco in the fields torn to pieces and most of that which was in the\r\nhouses perished with them.\"[17] Even then the misfortunes of the\r\nplanters were not ended, for in 1673 an epidemic occurred among their\r\ncattle, which carried off fifty thousand animals.[18]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their suffering the people looked back on the\r\nCommonwealth period as a golden era. Then they had enjoyed\r\nself-government; now their representatives had betrayed them. Then the\r\ntrade with the Dutch had brought prosperity; now the Navigation Acts had\r\nmade their tobacco almost worthless and reduced them to rags. Then men\r\nwere advanced to places of trust and honor because of their ability; now\r\nthe chief offices were reserved for those who toadied to the Governor.\r\nThen taxes had been moderate; now they were crushing.\r\n\r\nThe legend built up by Berkeley that Charles I had been the loving\r\nfather of the people received a crushing blow when it became known that\r\nhe had granted all the vast region between the Potomac and the\r\nRappahannock to Lord Hopton and several other noblemen. Charles II so\r\nfar responded to the plea of the Virginians for relief as to recall the\r\npatent and issue another in its place containing promises to protect\r\ntheir rights and property. But when they noted that the new patent\r\nrequired them to duplicate the quit rents of the past eleven years to\r\npay off the patentees, they were in despair. This would amount to so\r\nvast a sum that it would wipe out many estates.[19] So they appointed\r\nMajor General Robert Smith, Colonel Francis Moryson, and Thomas Ludwell\r\nto plead their cause in England.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the patent had been assigned to the Earl of St. Albans\r\nand three others. The agents began negotiations with these men and\r\napparently purchased it for a large sum to be raised in the colony.\r\nSeveral years later Berkeley wrote that the two great taxes of sixty\r\npounds of tobacco per poll to buy in the Northern patent had so aroused\r\nthe people that many were \"ripe for mutiny.\"\r\n\r\nNegotiations with St. Albans were still under way when the agents were\r\namazed to find that the King had issued a patent to the Earl of\r\nArlington and Lord Culpeper to all Virginia, with such rights and powers\r\nas to make them practically masters of the colony. To them were to go\r\nall escheats, quit rents, and duties formerly belonging to the Crown;\r\nthey could create new counties and parishes, issue patents to land,\r\nappoint civil officers.\r\n\r\nThis not only revokes former grants and privileges, but leaves us at the\r\nmercy of these lords who may look after their own interests \"without\r\nregard to the liberty of the people,\" complained the Assembly. The\r\ncommon people were so wrought up \"by being left to the oppression of\r\ntheir fellow subjects\" that they might mutiny or desert the colony.[20]\r\nFortunately, Arlington and Culpeper agreed to give up their patent in\r\nexchange for a grant of the Northern Neck, with the quit rents and\r\nescheats.\r\n\r\nTo protect the colony from such grants in the future, the agents now\r\npleaded for a charter guaranteeing that the people should have their\r\nimmediate dependence upon the Crown. They sought a promise, also, that\r\nthey should be taxed only by the Assembly. Had it not been for the\r\noutbreak of Bacon's Rebellion the charter might have gone through, for\r\ntwice it reached the great seal. As it was, when it was granted it\r\ncontained little more than the promise that Virginia should be directly\r\ndependent on the Crown.\r\n\r\nNever in American history were a people more greatly wronged than the\r\nVirginians in the Restoration period. With Charles II repaying their\r\nloyalty by sacrificing them to the greed of favorites, with the Governor\r\nthey had trusted making a mockery of self-government by corrupting the\r\nBurgesses, with their economic interests ignored to build up English\r\ncommerce and shipping, they reflected bitterly that they had been\r\nbetrayed. It was Berkeley himself who thought that if they saw an\r\nopportunity, the poor planters might go over to the Dutch in \"hopes of\r\nbettering their condition by sharing the plunder of the country with\r\nthem.\"[21] They \"speak openly there that they are in the nature of\r\nslaves, so that the hearts of the greatest part of them are taken away\r\nfrom his Majesty,\" reported a certain John Knight.[22]\r\n\r\nIn 1674, when the sheriffs began to collect the heavy taxes, there was a\r\nwild burst of anger. The money is not to be used for the benefit of the\r\ncolony, it was whispered, but merely \"the enriching of some few\r\npeople.\"[23] In two separate places the people rushed to arms,\r\ndetermined to resist. Berkeley at once issued a proclamation, requiring\r\nthem to disperse. But had they had a leader, some \"person of quality,\"\r\nthey would probably have anticipated Bacon's Rebellion by flying in the\r\nface of the government. As it was, by \"the advice of some discreet\r\npersons that have an influence upon them,\" they refrained from\r\nviolence.[24] But in many an humble cottage there were prayers that God\r\nwould send a leader to direct them in righting their many wrongs.\r\n\r\nThis leader they found two years later in Nathaniel Bacon. The son of a\r\nwealthy English squire, Thomas Bacon of Friston Hall, Suffolk;\r\nfellow-commoner in St. Catherine's Hall, Cambridge; a pupil of the great\r\nscientist John Ray and his companion in his celebrated tour of the\r\ncontinent, he seemed as much out of place in the forests of Virginia as\r\nBerkeley had been when he arrived three decades earlier. Bacon had been\r\nin Virginia but a few months when the Governor made him a member of the\r\nCouncil. \"Gentlemen of your quality come very rarely into this country,\r\nand therefore when they do come are used by me with all respect,\"[25] he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIt was with Sir William's friendly approbation that Bacon purchased a\r\nplantation at Curles Neck, on the James, forty miles above Jamestown. He\r\nbought also, a \"quarter,\" or farm to be managed by an overseer, on the\r\nfrontier at the site of Richmond. \"I chose to seat myself so remote, I\r\nhaving always delighted in solitude,\" he said.[26]\r\n\r\nBacon soon found himself at odds with the dictatorial Governor. It seems\r\nprobable that prowling Indians made off with some of his livestock and\r\nthat he, without consulting Berkeley, had retaliated. When Sir William\r\nreproved him, he lost his temper and was guilty of \"unbecoming\r\ndeportment.\"[27] At the meetings of the Council he obviously did not\r\nlike the way things were conducted, for he absented himself as much as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in Jamestown it is certain that he knew both Lawrence and\r\nDrummond. In fact it is probable that he boarded with Mrs. Lawrence, who\r\ntook in paying guests, and no doubt was one of several persons accused\r\nof keeping ordinaries \"at extraordinary prices.\" When the Assembly or\r\nthe General Court was in session, her house was crowded. To her clients\r\nLawrence, in so subtle a manner as not to cause suspicion, suggested the\r\npossibility of curbing \"the forwardness, avarice, and French despotic\r\nmethods of the Governor.\"[28] That he poured out the story of his own\r\nand the people's wrongs in Bacon's ears, and that Bacon proved a\r\nsympathetic listener, hardly admits of a doubt. Otherwise he would not\r\nhave risked his neck to seek him and Drummond out for a midnight\r\nconference after Berkeley had proclaimed him a rebel.\r\n\r\nWith Virginia a mass of explosives, the match which set them off was an\r\nIndian war. The Susquehannocks, a tribe friendly with the whites, had\r\nbeen attacked by the Senecas and driven from their towns at the head of\r\nthe Chesapeake Bay to the north bank of the Potomac near the site of\r\nFort Washington. Here they began a series of raids on the plantations on\r\nboth sides of the river in search of food. When a band of Indians of\r\nanother tribe crossed over to Virginia, killed several people, and\r\nescaped into Maryland, an enraged party of whites pursued them.\r\nUnfortunately, they made the mistake of attacking the Susquehannocks and\r\nkilling fourteen of them. The Susquehannocks retaliated with a series of\r\nmurders, and the Indian war was on.[29]\r\n\r\nWhile the Virginians and Marylanders were gathering their forces, the\r\nIndians busied themselves building a fort with high embankments, moat,\r\nand corner bastions. It presented so formidable an appearance that\r\nbefore attacking it the white commanders summoned the Indian \"great men\"\r\nto a parley. But when they came out, Major Trueman, of the Maryland\r\nforces, charging them with the recent murders, had them knocked on the\r\nhead. Infuriated at this breach of faith, the Indians in the fort made a\r\nsuccessful resistance, and at last broke through the besieging forces,\r\nmade their way up the left bank of the river, and crossed over to\r\nVirginia.[30]\r\n\r\nFalling upon the frontier plantations, they took ample revenge for the\r\nmurder of their \"great men.\" In a few days they had wiped out a number\r\nof families. Dragging off their miserable captives to secluded spots in\r\nthe forest, they staged scenes of horror that would have staggered the\r\nimagination of a Dante. Some they roasted alive and cut off pieces of\r\ntheir flesh, which they offered to their other victims. Others they\r\nbound to stakes, pulled their nails off, stuck feathers in their flesh,\r\nripped them open and wound their entrails around the trunks of\r\ntrees.[31]\r\n\r\nMemories of the days when he led his men to victory over Opechancanoe\r\nmust have come to Sir William, but he was now too old to take the\r\nfield. But he collected a strong force to go out against the Indians,\r\nand gave the command to Sir Henry Chicheley. Then, to everyone's\r\namazement, he changed his mind and disbanded the soldiers.[32] This he\r\nseems to have done for fear Chicheley might not be able to discriminate\r\nbetween friendly and unfriendly Indians. He stated that he planned to\r\nuse the Pamunkeys and Appomatox to be his \"spies and intelligence to\r\nfind out the more bloody enemies.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these tribes were no longer friendly. The gradual\r\nencroaching on their lands by the frontier families had forced them to\r\n\"live remote in the woods,\" and caused them to harbor a deep sense of\r\ninjustice. But even after Berkeley finally came to realize this, and\r\nadmitted that the neighboring tribes were aiding the Susquehannocks, he\r\nkept reverting to this policy.\r\n\r\nSo, when the savages renewed their raids, he called the Assembly\r\ntogether and pushed through legislation for a defensive war. It called\r\nfor the erection of forts on the frontier, the enlistment of five\r\nhundred men, and the use of friendly Indians.[33]\r\n\r\nTo the exposed families this seemed mere folly. Is it not easy for the\r\nIndians to sneak in between forts to fall upon us and commit their\r\ndevilish murders? they asked. We are already burdened enough with taxes\r\nwithout having more piled on for works which give us no protection. What\r\nis needed is a large mobile force to seek out the enemy and destroy\r\nthem. When petition after petition reached Berkeley, asking him to send\r\na leader, it merely aroused his brittle temper. As one group stood\r\nhumbly before him, they spoke of themselves as \"Your Honor's subjects.\"\r\n\"Why you are a set of fools and loggerheads. You are the King's\r\nsubjects, and so am I. A pox take you.\"[34]\r\n\r\nIn this Berkeley made his greatest mistake. Since he would not send the\r\nfrontiersmen a leader of his own selection, they picked a leader for\r\nthemselves. When the dread news spread in Charles City County that large\r\nbodies of Indians were on the upper James ready to descend on them,\r\nhundreds of angry men assembled in arms to resist them. Bacon, whose\r\nouter plantation had been plundered by the Indians and his overseer\r\nmurdered, was easily persuaded to join them. When he appeared a shout\r\nwent up, \"A Bacon! A Bacon! A Bacon! A Bacon!\" From that moment they\r\nwere ready to follow wherever he would lead.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Bacon made it clear that he would try to redress the\r\npeople's grievances as well as save them from the Indians. As the\r\nfrontiersmen gathered around him he addressed them, denouncing \"the\r\ngovernment as negligent and wicked,\" calling the ruling clique\r\n\"treacherous and incapable,\" the \"laws and taxes unjust and oppressive,\"\r\nand dwelling on \"the absolute necessity of redress.\"[35] Amid the shouts\r\nof approval he made them sign a large paper, \"writing their names\r\ncircular-wise that the ringleaders might not be found out.\" He then sent\r\nout \"emissaries\" to all parts of the colony to denounce the Governor,\r\ncomplain of the restrictions on the franchise, and demand the dismissal\r\nof the Long Assembly and a new election of Burgesses.[36] Instantly he\r\nbecame the hero of the people, \"the only patron of the country and the\r\npreserver of their lives and fortunes.\"\r\n\r\nHe hoped to gain his ends by peaceful means, and wrote the Governor\r\nasking for a commission to fight the Indians. When Berkeley, enraged at\r\nthe accusations of misgovernment, proclaimed him a rebel, he wrote that\r\nhe had taken up arms only to defend the country against the Indians. He\r\nthen marched into New Kent, a county \"ripe for rebellion\" to attack the\r\nPamunkeys, whom he had reason to believe had participated in some of the\r\nmurderous raids. But when they fled, he turned south in pursuit of a\r\nband of Susquehannocks. When he arrived at the Roanoke River, the\r\nOccaneechees, a friendly tribe living on an island in the river,\r\nvolunteered to go out and give battle to the Susquehannocks. But after\r\nthey had defeated them and returned to the island they became involved\r\nin a quarrel with Bacon. A desperate battle ensued in which the Indians\r\nwere defeated and forced to flee. After gathering up the spoils, Bacon\r\nturned his face homeward.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Berkeley had raised a force of three hundred men to\r\nintercept Bacon at the falls of the James. But he hastened back when he\r\nreceived word that the people everywhere were rising against him.\r\nAstonished, he asked the Council what the people wanted. They replied\r\nthat they were crying out against his refusal to hold an election for so\r\nmany years, and the denial to many of the right to vote. Since\r\nBerkeley's whole structure of political control was based on these two\r\npoints, to waive them must have seemed to him like complete surrender.\r\nBut he yielded, and called for an election of Burgesses in which all\r\nfreemen had the right to vote.\r\n\r\nBerkeley watched anxiously as the returns came in, and his henchmen, one\r\nafter the other, were defeated. When on June 5, 1676, the Burgesses\r\nassembled in the little statehouse in Jamestown, all but eight were of\r\n\"Bacon's faction.\" Bacon, himself was elected as one of the\r\nrepresentatives of Henrico County. Had he been permitted to take his\r\nseat, with an overwhelming majority behind him, he undoubtedly would\r\nhave dominated the proceedings and pushed through the reforms he had\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nBut he was not destined to take his seat. Instead of coming to Jamestown\r\non horse with a strong force, and posting the men in or near the town,\r\nhe set out in his sloop with only forty armed men. When they attempted\r\nto land they were fired on. That night Bacon slipped into town and held\r\na long conference with Lawrence and Drummond.[37] We can only surmise\r\nwhat passed between these two embittered men and the daring young\r\nleader. But it is safe to say that they discussed, not only Berkeley's\r\n\"French despotism,\" but what reforms Bacon should propose in the\r\nAssembly. It is probable that Lawrence and Drummond had already talked\r\nwith some of the pro-Bacon leaders, for the Governor warned the\r\nBurgesses not to be misled by these \"two rogues.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bacon was returning to his sloop he was discovered and captured and\r\nbrought before the Governor.\r\n\r\n\"Now I behold the greatest rebel that ever was in Virginia,\" Sir William\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, he asked: \"Mr. Bacon, have you forgot to be a\r\ngentleman?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, may it please your honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, I'll take your parole.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later, when the Council and Burgesses were assembled in the\r\nStatehouse, Berkeley rose and said:\r\n\r\n\"If there be joy in the presence of the angels over one sinner that\r\nrepenteth, there is joy now, for we have a penitent sinner come before\r\nus. Call Mr. Bacon.\"\r\n\r\nBacon then stepped forward and handed in his written submission. The\r\nGovernor resumed:\r\n\r\n\"God forgive you! I forgive you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And all that were with him?\" asked one of the Councillors.\r\n\r\n\"Yea, and all that were with him. Mr. Bacon, if you will live civilly\r\nbut till next quarter court I will promise to restore you again to your\r\nplace there,\" resumed the Governor, pointing to Bacon's vacant seat.[38]\r\nIn fact it was the very next day that he reappointed him to the Council.\r\n\r\nPhilip Ludwell explained this great leniency by pointing out that there\r\nwere hundreds of armed men within a day's march of Jamestown ready to\r\nrevenge any harm done to their leader. But Berkeley had an additional\r\nmotive. Bacon in the Council was far less dangerous than Bacon in the\r\nHouse of Burgesses. In the Council he would be under his watchful eye;\r\nin the House he would put himself at the head of the majority in pushing\r\nthrough reform measures.\r\n\r\nSo Bacon had to sit as a helpless and dissatisfied spectator, as\r\nBerkeley once more dominated the Assembly. Thomas Mathew, who was\r\npresent, tells us that \"some gentlemen took this opportunity to endeavor\r\nthe redressing several grievances the country then labored under,\" when\r\nthey were interrupted by pressing messages from the Governor to meddle\r\nwith nothing until the Indian business was dispatched.\r\n\r\nWith the matter of reform sidetracked, there followed a debate as to\r\nwhether two Councillors should be asked to sit on the committee on\r\nIndian affairs. \"The great sway that those of the Council bear over the\r\nrest of the Assembly in matters of laws and also in orders upon appeals,\r\nbeing commonly appointed chairman in all committees,\"[39] had been a\r\nlong-standing grievance. So now one member rose and pointed out that if\r\nthey had bad customs they had come together to correct them. In the end\r\nthe matter \"was huddled off without coming to a vote, and so the\r\ncommittee must submit to be overawed, and have every carped at\r\nexpression carried straight to the Governor.\"[40]\r\n\r\nBacon grew more and more restive as he saw the way things were going.\r\nThe Assembly did not prove \"answerable to our expectation,\" for which\r\nthey should be censured, he said later. When a motion was presented to\r\nrequest Berkeley not to resign, he must have looked on with disgust as\r\nenough pro-Bacon men assented for it to pass.\r\n\r\nSo under the pretext that his wife was ill, he got permission to leave\r\ntown. Then, instead of visiting Curles Neck, he headed for Henrico. Here\r\nhis veterans gathered around him. When they heard that he had suffered\r\nhumiliation, that he had been denied a commission, and that their\r\ngrievances had not been redressed, they \"set their throats in one common\r\nkey of oaths and curses.\" We will have a commission or \"pull down the\r\ntown,\" they said. \"Thus the raging torrent came down to town.\"[41]\r\n\r\nBerkeley made hasty preparations to resist them. But it was too late. In\r\nJamestown all was confusion. The cry was: \"To arms! To arms! Bacon is\r\nwithin two miles of the town.\" When the Governor realized that\r\nresistance would be useless, he ordered the guns to be dismantled, and\r\nreturned to the statehouse. So the motley army streamed into the\r\nvillage--weatherbeaten frontiersmen, demanding to be led out against the\r\nIndians; poor planters, seeking relief from heavy taxes; freedmen made\r\ndesperate by hunger and nakedness. The common cry was, \"No levies! No\r\nlevies!\"[42]\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses, hearing the hubbub, rushed to the windows of their hall\r\non the second story of the statehouse to witness the exciting scenes\r\nbelow. Bacon had asked them to grant him his commission, and now he\r\ncalled up to them, \"You Burgesses, I expect your speedy result.\"\r\nWhereupon his men cocked their fusils and aimed them at the windows.\r\n\"For God's sake hold your hands, forbear a little and you shall have\r\nwhat you please,\" cried the Burgesses.[43]\r\n\r\nAnd have it they did. It was now Berkeley's turn to be humiliated. He\r\nwas forced to make Bacon General of all the forces in Virginia. When\r\nthis was followed with a demand that he write the King a letter\r\ntestifying to Bacon's loyalty and the legality of all he had done, he\r\ncould no longer contain himself. Rushing out he threw back his coat and\r\ncried out; \"Here, shoot me, fore God fair mark.\" Bacon replied that he\r\nwould not hurt a hair of his head. And in the end he got the letter he\r\nwanted.[44]\r\n\r\nHe also got \"the redress of the people's grievances,\" he told Berkeley\r\nhe had come for. He mounted the stairs to the long room where the\r\nBurgesses sat and \"pressed hard, nigh an hour's harangue,\" not only on\r\npreserving the colony from the Indians, but on \"inspecting the revenues,\r\nthe exorbitant taxes, and redressing the grievances of that deplorable\r\ncountry.\" Then, to his surprise, he learned that a series of reform laws\r\nhad already been put through.\r\n\r\nBacon's escape from Jamestown had confronted the Assembly with a\r\ncompletely changed situation. No longer was he a virtual prisoner under\r\nthe Governor's eye and his veterans without a leader. Now he was at\r\ntheir head once more to march on the town and revenge their wrongs with\r\narms in their hands. \"We have all the reason in the world to suspect\r\nthat their designs are ruinous,\" said Philip Ludwell. So the pro-Bacon\r\nmajority in the Assembly took advantage of the general alarm to rush\r\nthrough a remarkable series of reform laws that struck at the very basis\r\nof Berkeley's power. Sir William certainly would not have affixed his\r\nsignature had he not considered his situation desperate. Some months\r\nlater, after the rebellion had been suppressed, all the laws of this\r\nsession were repealed on the ground that they had been secured by\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nThese bills may have been outlined by Bacon, Lawrence, and Drummond\r\nduring their famous midnight conference and introduced by some friend in\r\nthe House. They may have been drawn up by the committee on grievances.\r\nThomas Blayton was later accused of being \"Bacon's great engine\" in the\r\nAssembly, and James Minge, the clerk, of being \"another Bacon's great\r\nfriends in forming the laws.\" Virginia historians have long called them\r\nBacon's Laws and rightly, since they struck at the abuses he had\r\ndenounced, were passed in an Assembly dominated by his friends, and\r\nunder the pressure of his armed forces.\r\n\r\nThe very enactment of Bacon's Laws throws a flood of light on the abuses\r\nthey were intended to rectify. They broadened the franchise by giving\r\nall freemen the right to vote; they restored a degree of democracy in\r\nlocal government by giving the people a voice in assessing county taxes\r\nand in naming vestrymen and by barring Councillors from sitting on the\r\ncounty courts; they fixed fees for sheriffs and other officials; they\r\nstruck at the Governor's appointive power by making it illegal for\r\nsheriffs to serve more than one year at a time, or for anyone to hold\r\nmore than one of the offices of sheriff, clerk of the court, surveyor,\r\nor escheator at the same time.[45] Far-reaching though they were,\r\nBacon's Laws did not include an act to prohibit officeholders from\r\nsitting in the Assembly. Such a law, if permitted to stand, would have\r\nput an end forever to the Berkeley system of rule by placemen.\r\n\r\nAfter Bacon left Jamestown to battle with the Indians the colony might\r\nhave enjoyed internal peace had Berkeley remained quiet, contenting\r\nhimself with placing the whole matter before the King. But he tried to\r\nraise forces to take the rebels in the rear, and civil war resulted.\r\n\r\nIn this war Bacon at first seemed to sweep all before him. As he led his\r\nmen back from the frontier he was everywhere hailed as the people's\r\nfriend and savior. On the other hand, none but a handful remained loyal\r\nto the Governor, so that he was forced to take refuge across the\r\nChesapeake Bay on the Eastern Shore.\r\n\r\nWhen Bacon found himself master of all Virginia except Northampton and\r\nAccomac Counties, he set up his headquarters at Middle Plantation, the\r\nsite of Williamsburg. Here he was joined by Lawrence and Drummond, who\r\nseem to have helped him in drawing up a manifesto against Berkeley, and\r\nin holding a conference with a number of leading planters and binding\r\nthem by oath to be faithful to him.[46]\r\n\r\nSoon after this Bacon held a conversation with a certain John Goode\r\nwhich shows that he had thoughts of extending his rebellion to\r\nneighboring colonies and setting up an independent state.\r\n\r\n\"There is a report that Sir William Berkeley hath sent to the King for\r\n2,000 redcoats, and I do believe it may be true,\" said Bacon. \"Tell me\r\nyour opinion, may not 500 Virginians beat them, we having the same\r\nadvantages against them the Indians have against us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather conceive 500 redcoats may either subject or ruin Virginia,\"\r\nGoode replied.\r\n\r\n\"You talk strangely. Are we not acquainted with the country, can lay\r\nambushes, and take to trees and put them by the use of their discipline,\r\nand are doubtless as good or better shots than they?\"\r\n\r\n\"But they can accomplish what I have said without hazard ... by ...\r\nlanding where there shall be no opposition, firing our houses and\r\nfences, ... preventing all trade.\"\r\n\r\nBacon replied that he knew how to prevent this.\r\n\r\nGoode then pointed out that all the principal men in the country would\r\njoin the redcoats.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he added, \"you speak as though you designed a total defection\r\nfrom his Majesty and our country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, have not many princes lost their dominions so?\" asked Bacon.\r\n\r\nGoode replied that his followers did not think themselves engaged\r\nagainst the King's authority, but against the Indians.\r\n\r\n\"But I think otherwise, and I am confident of it that it is the mind of\r\nthis country, and of Maryland and Carolina also to cast off their\r\nGovernors, ... and if we cannot prevail by arms to make our conditions\r\nfor peace, or obtain the privilege to elect our own Governor, we may\r\nretire to Roanoke.\"[47]\r\n\r\nWhether Bacon could have enlisted the peoples of Carolina and Maryland\r\nin his cause, secured naval and military aid from the Dutch, and\r\nanticipated the American Revolution by a century, must remain in the\r\nrealm of speculation. But before he could proceed far with his plans he\r\nsuffered an irreparable disaster--he lost command of the water.\r\n\r\nIn Bacon's Rebellion, as in the Revolution and the War between the\r\nStates, the great Virginia rivers made it possible for the side which\r\nhad superior naval forces to penetrate into the heart of the country,\r\nwhile they proved a barrier to the movement of troops by land. So when\r\nseveral merchant vessels, which Bacon had seized and armed, fell into\r\nBerkeley's hands, leaving him the undisputed master in Virginia waters,\r\nthe rebel cause became almost hopeless.[48]\r\n\r\nYet it is remarkable that when the Governor had assembled a formidable\r\nforce, brought them up the James, and occupied Jamestown, Bacon\r\nsucceeded in driving him out. The place seemed impregnable, since the\r\nonly approach was over a narrow isthmus, protected by barricades and\r\nguarded by the cannon of the ships in the river. Berkeley himself\r\nsupplies the explanation when he reported that his men refused to fight,\r\nbut in spite of his urgent pleas, hurried him on shipboard and away.[49]\r\n\r\nSo Bacon's men entered the little capital unopposed. But they realized\r\nthat they could not hold it, for Berkeley's fleet was still nearby,\r\nwhile other loyalist forces were threatening from the north. After a\r\nconsultation, the leaders decided to burn the town. Lawrence applied the\r\ntorch to his own house. Drummond to his, Bacon to the little church,\r\nothers to Berkeley's five houses, and the statehouse.[50] As Berkeley\r\nsaw the flames rising above the rooftops and reflected on the waters of\r\nthe James he cursed the cowardice of the men who had forced him to\r\ndesert the place.\r\n\r\nBut now the end was at hand for Bacon. While at the house of Major\r\nThomas Pate, in Gloucester County, he became ill of dysentery. As he lay\r\non his deathbed, he kept inquiring whether the redcoats had arrived, and\r\nwhether there was a strong guard around the house. We do not know\r\nwhether his wife was there to comfort him in his last hours, but it is\r\nprobable that she was far away at Curles Neck. He died October 26, 1676.\r\nKnowing that Berkeley would want to expose the body on a gibbet,\r\nLawrence is said to have disposed of it in secret, probably with a night\r\nservice somewhere in the Virginia woods, and then to have had a public\r\nfuneral with a casket weighted with stones.[51]\r\n\r\nBacon was mourned in many a humble cottage throughout the colony. Who\r\nnow would lead the people in their struggle to gain their rights? One of\r\nhis followers wrote in touching verse that death had ended \"our hopes of\r\nsafety, liberty, our all.\"[52] There was no one else who had won the\r\nconfidence and affection of the people to take his place.\r\n\r\nThe struggle continued for three more months, the rebels won more\r\nvictories, but something like anarchy ensued. There was no central\r\ngovernment, some of the county courts were closed, crops were rotting in\r\nthe fields, servants and slaves left their masters to join the rebel\r\nforces, there was indiscriminate plundering, the masters of the\r\nincoming merchant vessels refused to sell their goods to the rebels or\r\nbuy what tobacco they had on hand.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Berkeley got his hands on some of Bacon's followers, he began\r\na series of executions unparalleled in American history. Thomas Hansford\r\npleaded that he might be shot like a soldier, but Sir William told him\r\nhe was condemned, not as a soldier, but as a rebel. As he stood on the\r\nscaffold he addressed the assembled crowd, declaring that he died a\r\nloyal subject and lover of his country.[53] When Major Cheeseman was\r\nbrought before the Governor, his wife rushed in to plead that she be\r\nhanged and her husband spared. Berkeley spurned her with a vile insult.\r\nCheeseman cheated the hangman by dying in prison.[54] But Captain\r\nWilford, George Farloe, Thomas Young, and others soon followed Hansford\r\nto the gallows.\r\n\r\nThe end came before the arrival of the English troops. Group after group\r\nsurrendered, and their leaders took the oath of loyalty, kissed the\r\nGovernor's hand, and were pardoned. But there was no pardon for Bacon's\r\ntwo chief advisers. \"I so much hate Drummond and Lawrence that though\r\nthey could put the country in peace into my hands, I would not accept it\r\nfrom such villains,\" Berkeley declared.[55]\r\n\r\nLawrence escaped. He was last seen with four others on the extreme\r\nfrontier, riding through the snow and disappearing into the forest.\r\nTheir fate is unknown. Drummond was found hiding in Chickahominy Swamp\r\nand brought before the Governor. He was greeted with a mocking bow. \"Mr.\r\nDrummond, you are very welcome. I am more glad to see you than any man\r\nin Virginia. Mr. Drummond, you shall be hanged in half an hour.\" He was\r\ntreated with savage brutality, and then, after the pretence of a trial,\r\nhurried off to the scaffold.[56]\r\n\r\nBacon and Drummond did not die in vain. Though they and thousands of\r\nothers were stigmatized as rebels and traitors, though the cause they\r\ncontended for ended in disastrous failure, Bacon's Rebellion had a\r\nlasting influence on American history. It served as a warning that\r\nAmericans would not submit to misgovernment and despotism under whatever\r\nform. Had not the British Government under George III forgotten that\r\nwarning there might have been no American Revolution.\r\n\r\nTo contend, as some have done, that Bacon's Rebellion was no more than a\r\nquarrel between a rash young man and an old fool, is to make the most\r\nshallow interpretation. Men do not rush to arms, and risk their lives\r\nand property in a wild uprising because of a dispute between\r\nindividuals. As Professor Charles M. Andrews has pointed out,\r\nrevolutions \"are the detonations of explosive materials, long\r\naccumulating and often dormant. They are the resultant of a vast complex\r\nof economic, political, social, and legal forces, which taken\r\ncollectively are the masters, not the servants, of statesmen and\r\npolitical agitators. They are never sudden in their origin, but look\r\nback to influences long in the making.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] William Edmundson, _Journal_, 71, 72.\r\n\r\n[2] _Virginia Magazine_ 3: 134.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._, 135.\r\n\r\n[4] _Virginia Magazine_ 3: 141, 142.\r\n\r\n[5] CO5-1371, p. 241.\r\n\r\n[6] _Bath papers_, \"Virginia's Deplored Condition.\"\r\n\r\n[7] _Ibid._ 1: 173.\r\n\r\n[8] _Bath papers_, \"Bacon's Manifesto.\"\r\n\r\n[9] _Ibid._, Berkeley to Right Honorable, Feb. 9, 1677.\r\n\r\n[10] CO1-21, Norwood to Williamson, 17, 1667.\r\n\r\n[11] G.

As for Berkeley's policy of rule by\r\nplacemen, if he knew anything about it, he could but reflect that he\r\nhimself had set the example.\r\n\r\nBut he realized that something had to be done, not only to restore\r\norder, but to remove at least some of the causes of discontent. So he\r\nappointed Colonel Herbert Jeffreys, Sir John Berry, and Colonel Francis\r\nMoryson a committee to go to Virginia to enquire into all grievances and\r\nreport back to him. As for Berkeley, though he was to retain the title\r\nof Governor, he was ordered to return to England \"with all possible\r\nspeed.\" During his absence Jeffreys was to be Lieutenant Governor, with\r\nall the powers of Governor.[1]\r\n\r\nThe King then drew up a proclamation, which he directed Jeffreys to\r\npublish in the colony, stating that he was willing to extend his royal\r\ncompassion to all except Bacon who would return to their duty and\r\nobedience, and authorizing the Governor in his name to pardon all he\r\nthought \"fit and convenient for our service.\"[2] But he mingled force\r\nwith leniency by placing a thousand well-equipped men under Jeffrey's\r\ncommand. For the second time within twenty-five years an English\r\nexpedition set sail to bring the Virginians to \"obedience.\" Berry and\r\nMoryson, with part of the army, arrived in the James River in January,\r\n1677, and Jeffreys soon followed with the rest.[3]\r\n\r\nThey found the colony in a deplorable condition. With the people bitter\r\nand sullen, with neighbor arrayed against neighbor, with hundreds of\r\nhouses and barns in ashes, with trade disrupted, there was need for\r\nunselfish and statesmanlike guidance. There should have been an\r\nimmediate restoration of the rule of law, so that no man could be made\r\nto suffer without a trial before his peers. There should have been an\r\nelection of Burgesses, in which the people could make their choices\r\nwithout pressure from the Governor and the Council. There should have\r\nbeen an honest effort to assuage flaming resentments, to give heed to\r\nthe people's grievances, to unite all classes in binding up the wounds\r\nof war and bringing peace and some measure of prosperity to the\r\ndistracted colony.\r\n\r\nThe situation was not unlike that in the South at the close of the War\r\nbetween the States. And as the South, after the assassination of\r\nPresident Lincoln, was left a prey to vultures--the so-called\r\nCarpetbaggers and Scaliwags--Virginia after the collapse of Bacon's\r\nRebellion, was sacrificed to the vindictiveness and greed of Berkeley\r\nand his supporters.\r\n\r\n\"Two wrongs do not make a right.\" Though a loyalist may have suffered\r\nseverely by the plundering of rebel bands, he was not justified in\r\ntrying to make good his losses by robbing a neighbor, even though that\r\nneighbor had sided with Bacon. But the Governor, instead of insisting\r\nthat his friends seek restitution only through the courts, himself was\r\nforemost in making illegal seizures. When he returned to Green Spring,\r\nthe sight of his plundered house and barns, and the empty meadows where\r\nonce hundreds of cattle and sheep had grazed drove him to fury. He\r\nshowed \"a greedy determination thoroughly to heal himself before he\r\ncared to staunch the bleeding gashes of the woefully lacerated country,\"\r\nby seizing men's \"estates, cattle, servants, and carrying off their\r\ntobacco.\"[4] Some of the wretched men who were dragged before him he\r\nthreatened with hanging unless they gave him most or all that they\r\nowned. A certain James Barrow was imprisoned at Green Spring, where \"by\r\nreason of the extremity of cold, hunger, loathsomeness of vermin,\" he\r\nwas forced to agree to the payment of a ruinous composition.[5]\r\n\r\nThe King's commissioners received a cool reception from Berkeley. He\r\nwanted no investigation of the causes of the rebellion, he wanted no\r\ninterference with his hangings and seizures. He pointed out that he had\r\nsuppressed the rebellion before the arrival of the troops, and pretended\r\nto be surprised that the King had thought it necessary to send them.[6]\r\nWhen the commissioners told him that illegal seizures must stop, he flew\r\ninto such a rage that they decided that future communication with him\r\nshould be by writing. This would avoid the \"loud and fierce speaking\"\r\nnecessitated by his deafness.[7]\r\n\r\nBut there must have been \"loud and fierce speaking\" indeed when the\r\ncommissioners went to Green Spring and showed Berkeley the King's\r\nproclamation of pardon, and the order that he return immediately to\r\nEngland. All his life Berkeley had regarded the King's command as\r\nsacred. To resist his will was as wicked as it was illegal. But now, on\r\nflimsy pretexts, he deliberately disobeyed him. He postponed his\r\ndeparture for three months, declaring that the word \"conveniency\" gave\r\nhim the right to remain as long as he wished. He did publish the\r\nproclamation, but here again he found an excuse to balk the King's\r\nobvious intent to pardon all save Bacon. Issuing a proclamation of his\r\nown he \"saw fit\" to exempt from pardon not only a long list by name, but\r\nall persons then in prison charged with rebellion. Since the jails were\r\noverflowing, this left scores of miserable men trembling for their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nSo the trials and executions continued. Gyles Bland, despite the\r\npleading of influential friends in England, was hastened off to the\r\ngallows. When Robert Jones showed the wounds he had received fighting\r\nfor the King in the Civil War, Moryson pleaded with Lady Berkeley to\r\nintercede for him. \"I would with more easiness of mind have worn the\r\ncanvas linen the rebels said they would make me glad of,\" replied this\r\nproud lady.[8] Yet she weakened, and the Governor did pardon him. Others\r\nwere not so fortunate. Not until the Assembly requested him \"to hold his\r\nhand from all other sanguinary punishment,\" after a score or more had\r\npaid the extreme penalty, did he put an end to the executions.[9]\r\n\r\nYet the Assembly was overwhelmingly loyalist. If we may believe William\r\nSherwood most of the Burgesses were Berkeley's \"own creatures and chose\r\nby his appointments before the arrival of the commissioners.\"[10] In the\r\nelections intimidation and even fraud were used freely. Jeffreys wrote\r\nthat the Assembly \"by reason of the unsettled condition of the country\r\nwas not so legally nor freely elected.\"[11] In Charles City County a\r\npetition was posted on the courthouse door demanding a new election on\r\nthe grounds that there had been illegal voting.[12]\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, this Assembly backed Berkeley in all he had done\r\nand was doing. They praised his wisdom, bravery, justice, and integrity.\r\nThey did their best to block the commissioners in their inquiry into the\r\ncauses of the rebellion. When the people presented their grievances they\r\nwere denounced as \"libellous, scandalous, and rebellious.\"[13] Many\r\nformer rebels were forced to make humble submission on their knees\r\nbefore the Governor and Council, with ropes around their necks.[14] Some\r\nwere attainted, some were banished. To speak ill of the Governor and\r\nCouncil was made a high crime punishable by whipping.\r\n\r\nThe people were deeply angered by the brutality of the Governor and his\r\npuppet Assembly. Governor Notley, of Maryland, thought that, should a\r\nleader appear who was bold enough to risk his neck, \"the commons of\r\nVirginia would enmire themselves as deep in rebellion as ever they did\r\nin Bacon's time.\"[15] Many a sullen planter eyed his fusil longingly, in\r\nthe hope that Lawrence might emerge from the forests to head a new\r\nmutiny.[16] \"The putrid humor of our unruly inhabitants are not so\r\nallayed, but that they do frequently vent themselves ... and were they\r\nnot awed by the overruling hand of his Majesty would soon express\r\nthemselves by violent acts,\" wrote Secretary Nicholas Spencer.[17] That\r\nthe Assembly was not unconcerned at the danger is shown by their\r\nre-enacting in much the original form of several of Bacon's reform laws.\r\n\r\nBerkeley and his friends treated Jeffreys with contempt. \"A pitiful\r\nlittle fellow with a periwig,\" Philip Ludwell called him.[18] But it\r\ntook a woman's spite to give him the greatest insult. When the\r\ncommissioners heard that at last Berkeley was about to leave for\r\nEngland, they called on him at Green Spring. On leaving they found the\r\nGovernor's coach waiting for them at the door. They did not realize that\r\nLady Berkeley was peeping through \"a broken quarrel of glass to observe\r\nhow the show looked.\" But they were horrified to learn on reaching their\r\ndestination that the coachman was the \"common hangman.\" \"The whole\r\ncountry rings of ... the public odium and disgrace cast on us, as the\r\nExchange itself shortly may,\" they wrote.[19]\r\n\r\nIt was on May 5, 1677, that Berkeley sailed for England on the\r\n_Rebecca_. The passage, though quick, was a terrible one for him. As he\r\npaced the deck, he could but reflect that the time was at hand when he\r\nmust account to his royal master, not only for the failure of his\r\nadministration, but for his flagrant disobedience. By the time he\r\nreached England the \"tedious passage and grief of mind\" had reduced him\r\nto great weakness. But he pleaded for an opportunity to \"clear his\r\ninnocency.\" If it is true, as was whispered about, that word reached his\r\nears that the King had said that that old fool had hanged more men in\r\nthat naked country than he for the murder of his father, it must have\r\nbroken his heart. He died on July 13, 1677, and was interred at\r\nTwickenham.\r\n\r\nBerkeley's departure did not bring peace to the distracted colony. The\r\nloyalist faction had spread the report that Jeffreys was merely Sir\r\nWilliam's deputy, that he could not exercise the full powers of\r\nGovernor, and would retire upon his return. To refute these rumors\r\nJeffreys issued a proclamation a few days before Berkeley left, formally\r\ntaking over the government. In it he declared that he had as much power\r\nas any other Governor, and warned all men against belittling his office.\r\nAnd he put his finger on the very foundation of the Berkelean system\r\nwhen he declared that he would strive to reform, regulate, and redress\r\n\"all apparent abuses, oppressions, excesses, and defects in the power,\r\npractice, and proceedings of all county courts.\"[20]\r\n\r\nBut reform was just what the loyalists did not want. They wanted the\r\ngrievances of the people suppressed, the county courts to be packed with\r\ntheir friends; they wished to continue their illegal seizures. The\r\nleader of this group was the colorful and vigorous Lady Berkeley. She\r\nheld such frequent meetings at her home that the loyalists became known\r\nas the Green Spring Faction. Here came Colonel Edward Hill, \"a great\r\noppressor, of unparalleled impudence\"; Philip Ludwell, Lady Berkeley's\r\nfuture husband; Robert Beverley, who Jeffreys declared had risen from a\r\n\"mean condition\" by toadying to Berkeley; and others.[21]\r\n\r\nAs they sat in the spacious hall where the Assembly had met after the\r\nburning of the statehouse in Jamestown, they denounced Jeffreys as a\r\nnincompoop, who was not worth a groat in England, as a liar, as a \"worse\r\nrebel than Bacon.\" They would secure compensation for their losses\r\ndespite all he could do. So they planned their strategy. Lady Berkeley\r\nwas to strike terror into the people by threatening dire things when Sir\r\nWilliam returned. Nor did they relax their efforts when word of\r\nBerkeley's death reached the colony. It was known that Lord Culpeper was\r\nhis successor, so Lady Berkeley gave it out that he was her close\r\nfriend, and promised great favors upon his arrival. To plead their cause\r\nin England they engaged Captain Alexander Culpeper, Lady Berkeley's\r\nbrother.[22]\r\n\r\nAfter Berkeley's departure Jeffreys had called for the election of a new\r\nAssembly to meet October 10, 1677. Unfortunately, at this moment, when\r\nhe was most needed, he became ill. Early in September a letter from the\r\nPrivy Council to the Governor and Council had been received, making void\r\nBerkeley's proclamation of February 10, which had excepted so many\r\npersons from the royal pardon. Had Jeffreys been a well man he would\r\ncertainly have published this letter immediately and relieved the people\r\nfrom their fear. But the Council urged him to conceal it for the\r\npresent, and being weak and in bed, he yielded. This daring defiance of\r\nthe King's orders had an important effect on the election, for the\r\npeople were still trembling for their lives and property, and so were\r\nbullied by the sheriffs into returning loyalist Burgesses. Daniel Parke\r\nreported that there had been illegal elections in James City County,\r\nKent, and elsewhere.[23]\r\n\r\nIt was in October that Parke arrived from England and delivered to\r\nJeffreys a letter from Secretary Coventry, telling him that Berkeley had\r\ndied and that Culpeper had kissed the King's hand as Governor. Even then\r\nthe Council was opposed to the publication of the King's order to void\r\nBerkeley's proclamation, protesting that it had been procured by\r\nmisinformation. But the contents leaked out, and there was bitter\r\nresentment at the delay. Most of the Assembly demanded its publication.\r\nAt last, when Jeffreys and Parke had won over a majority of the Council\r\nto the view that it would be unwise to trifle further with the royal\r\ncommand, the two Ludwells flung themselves away in \"a seeming passion.\"\r\nBut there was great relief and widespread rejoicing among the\r\npeople.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly met at Middle Plantation, the site of Williamsburg, in the\r\nhouse of Captain Otho Thorp. Despite the irregularity of the elections\r\nit showed a far greater spirit of independence than its predecessor. It\r\npassed a law against making unreasonable compositions for injuries done\r\nduring the rebellion; it imposed a penalty for the use of such terms as\r\ntraitor, rebel, or rogue; it forbade the impressing of cattle, boats, or\r\nprovisions without compensation; it regulated fees.[25] But it placed a\r\ncrushing burden on the prostrate colony by levying a tax of 100 pounds\r\nof tobacco per tithable. \"This, with the county and parish tax is in\r\nsome counties 250 pounds, in some 300, and in some 400, which falls very\r\nheavily on the poorer people,\" Parke reported.[26]\r\n\r\nThe Thorp house rang with protests when Robert Beverley, who was clerk\r\nof the Assembly, reported that the King's commissioners had taken their\r\njournals, orders, and acts from him by force. In a vigorous protest to\r\nJeffreys, they declared this a great violation of their privileges. This\r\nseizure we \"humbly suppose his Majesty would not ... command, for that\r\nthey find not the same to have been practiced by any of the Kings of\r\nEngland.\" So they asked Jeffreys to give assurance that such a thing\r\nwould not happen again.[27]\r\n\r\nWhen this was reported to Charles II he was surprised at the presumption\r\nof the Assembly in calling in question his authority. Referring the\r\nmatter to the Lords of Trade, he asked them what he should do to bring\r\nthe Assembly to a sense \"of their duty and submission.\" The Lords\r\nthought that the protest tended to rebellion, and that the Governor\r\nshould rebuke the Assembly and punish the \"authors and abettors.\"[28]\r\nCharles issued the order, but later, on the earnest plea of the Virginia\r\nCouncil, rescinded it. But he insisted that the protest be \"razed out of\r\nthe books of Virginia.\"[29] It was a strange twist of fate which caused\r\nan attempt by the King to investigate the grievances of the people to\r\nresult in what may be considered the opening act of the Second Stuart\r\nDespotism in Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, during Jeffreys' illness, Thomas Ludwell presided over\r\nthe meetings of the Council. So the King's commands were ignored, and\r\nthe plundering, confiscations, and banishing continued. \"Great numbers\r\nof poor men, having wives and children to maintain,\" faced utter\r\nruin.[30] The lengths to which the Green Spring Faction was prepared to\r\ngo is illustrated by a statement of Colonel Edward Hill at one of their\r\ngatherings. One of those present remarked that William Byrd would\r\ncertainly win a case pending in which he was involved because he was in\r\nEngland and could secure the King's backing. \"That will not do,\" said\r\nHill, \"for if the King should send in his letter, in that case we are\r\nnot to take notice of it.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThis is just what they did when Charles wrote in behalf of Sarah\r\nDrummond, widow of William Drummond. This poor woman made the long\r\nvoyage across the ocean to lay her case before the King. So great was\r\nGovernor Berkeley's hatred of her husband, she said, that he had not\r\nonly taken his life, but had seized his small plantation for his own use\r\nand forced her to flee with her five small children into the woods,\r\nwhere they might have starved had not the commissioners befriended\r\nthem.[32] Moved by her misfortunes, the King sent an especial command\r\nthat her property be returned. But when she brought an action in the\r\nGeneral Court against Lady Berkeley, and the King's letter was read, one\r\nof the Councillors, turning to the crowd in the courtroom, declared in a\r\nloud voice that it was based on nothing but lies. \"So they dismissed the\r\ncase.\"[33]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Jeffreys had sufficiently recovered his health to\r\nstrike back at his enemies. He had tried to win them over by appointing\r\nthem to collectors' places and doing them other favors, but without\r\nsuccess. So at last he retaliated upon Beverley by ousting him from his\r\ncivil and military offices and \"silenced him from pleading in the\r\ncourts.\"[34] When Philip Ludwell's many insults were reported to\r\nJeffreys he had him arrested and charged him with \"scandalizing the\r\nGovernor and abusing the authority of his Majesty.\" This was a serious\r\nmatter indeed, for the penalty was whipping or the payment of a fine of\r\n500 pounds of tobacco. The jury pronounced Ludwell guilty, and asked the\r\nCouncil to fix the punishment. Since most of the Council were Ludwell's\r\nwarm friends, Jeffreys appealed the case to the King. Ludwell countered\r\nby appealing to the Assembly. In the end it was decided that the whole\r\ncase, including the matter of appeal, should be left to his Majesty.[35]\r\n\r\nBut in the summer of 1678 Jeffreys again became ill, and the Green\r\nSpring Faction renewed the \"old exactions and abuses.\" William Sherwood\r\nreported: \"The colony would be as peaceful as could be wished except for\r\nthe malice of some discontented persons of the late Governor's party,\r\nwho endeavor by all the cunning contrivances that by their artifice can\r\nbe brought about, to bring a contempt of Colonel Jeffreys, our present\r\ngood Governor.... It is to be feared unless these fiery spirits are\r\nallayed or removed home, there will not be that settled, happy peace and\r\nunity which otherwise might be, for they are entered into a faction\r\nwhich is upheld by the expectation of my Lord Culpeper's doing mighty\r\nthings for them.\"[36]\r\n\r\nJeffreys died on December 17, 1678. A well-meaning man, who tried to\r\nrule justly, he lacked the strength of character needed to bring peace\r\nto the colony. With an army at his command, he should have put Governor\r\nBerkeley on board ship and sent him to England when he refused to obey\r\nthe King's commands. This would have prevented many hangings, relieved\r\nthe fears of the people, and given pause to the Green Spring Faction.\r\nBut Jeffreys knew that Berkeley's brother, Lord John Berkeley, was in\r\nhigh favor with the King, and he dared not offend him.\r\n\r\nJeffreys' wife came from England to join him, but she was just in time\r\nto say a farewell, for he was seized with a violent sickness four hours\r\nafter her arrival and died soon after.[37] So bitter were the Green\r\nSpring Faction against him that they tried to prevent the payment to his\r\nwidow of L1,200 due him for nine months' salary, and to charge her with\r\nall the perquisites he had received. When, as a consequence, she could\r\nnot meet all his obligations, they imprisoned her for debt. It was only\r\nby appealing to Secretary Coventry that she received the arrears due her\r\nand was able to free herself from the power of her enemies.[38]\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Jeffreys, Sir Henry Chicheley produced a commission as\r\nDeputy Governor given him in 1674. Chicheley was a \"most loyal, worthy\r\nperson, and deservedly beloved by the whole country.\"[39] He had been a\r\nBurgess, a member of the Council, had commanded the Virginia forces in\r\nthe Indian war, had remained loyal to Berkeley during the rebellion, and\r\nhad been imprisoned by Bacon. But he was now \"old, sickly, and crazy,\"\r\nand lacked the vigor to force obedience and restore order. During the\r\neighteen months of his administration the old factions were not\r\nreconciled to one another.[40]\r\n\r\nYet Chicheley, to the extent of his ability, ruled impartially and well.\r\nAt the election of 1679 he insisted that the people be protected from\r\nintimidation at the polls. As a result the Assembly showed a spirit of\r\nindependence and a desire to rectify the people's grievances. A degree\r\nof democracy was introduced into local government by an act empowering\r\nthe voters of each parish to elect two men to sit in the county courts\r\nin the making of by-laws. A limit was put to fees demanded by the\r\ncollectors of customs and the clerks of the courts. The claim of the\r\nGreen Spring Faction for compensation for their losses was referred to\r\nthe next session.[41]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1680, Lord Culpeper arrived in Virginia after a tedious passage\r\nof two and a half months, in which scurvy and other diseases took a\r\nheavy toll. Chicheley handed over the government to him and the\r\nreconstruction period came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic Virginian, as he looked back over the years from the\r\ncollapse of Bacon's Rebellion to the arrival of Culpeper must have seen\r\nin them nothing but confusion and disaster. The colony was divided\r\nagainst itself, the most pressing of the people's grievances had not\r\nbeen redressed, many families had been reduced to poverty, the right to\r\nvote was denied to hundreds, taxes were higher than ever, and tobacco\r\nwas still a drug on the market.\r\n\r\nYet important changes were taking place which gave reason for hope.\r\nDuring Berkeley's administration the newly created aristocracy, the men\r\nof wealth, the leaders in their own counties--the Ludwells, the Parkes,\r\nthe Custises, the Coles--had worked in close alliance with the Governor.\r\nThe common people, on the other hand, lacked leaders to guide them in\r\ntheir struggle for their rights. But with Berkeley's departure the\r\naristocrats, so far from allying themselves with his successor, came\r\ninto violent conflict with him. And the Governor now assumed the role of\r\nthe people's friend and protector.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed were the Virginians in their own disputes that their\r\nattention was diverted from events in England, events that were to\r\naffect them profoundly. For many years Charles II had lived in\r\ncomparative peace with his Cavalier Parliament, maintaining his\r\nmistresses in luxury despite the meagerness of his revenue. But the rise\r\nof the Whig Party under the leadership of the able Earl of Shaftesbury\r\nwas now threatening to undermine his power. All London was in terror\r\nwhen Titus Oates came forward with a wild story that the Catholics were\r\nplotting to bring in Irish and French troops, massacre the Protestants,\r\nand murder the King. The Whigs were demanding the exclusion from the\r\nsuccession of Charles' Roman Catholic brother James, and some actually\r\nproposed that the King divorce his Catholic wife and marry a Protestant.\r\n\r\nFaced with the loss of his prerogatives, the indolent King struck back.\r\nHis father had tried to free himself from dependence on Parliament by\r\nillegal taxation; he by sacrificing England's foreign interests for\r\nFrench gold. In March, 1678, Charles negotiated a secret treaty with\r\nLouis XIV in return for L300,000. Now he was in a position to thumb his\r\nnose at the Commons when they tried to control and thwart him. It was\r\nthe beginning of the Second Stuart Despotism.[42]\r\n\r\nThe change was immediately reflected in colonial policies. The old\r\nCouncil of Plantations, and its successor the Council of Trade and\r\nPlantations had done little to supervise and control the conduct of\r\naffairs in America. But in December, 1674, after the fall of the Cabal\r\nMinistry, the direction of colonial matters was turned over to a\r\ncommittee of the Privy Council, presided over by the Secretary of State.\r\nIn this way the King's most trusted ministers were brought into close\r\ntouch with the colonies. Sir Joseph Williamson, Secretary from 1674 to\r\n1678, was a most obedient servant of the King; his fellow Secretary, Sir\r\nHenry Coventry, had defended Charles I on the field of battle, and now\r\ndefended his son before the public; Sir Leoline Jenkins was called \"the\r\nmost faithful drudge of a Secretary that ever the Court had.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no way of knowing whether these men, in their assault on liberty\r\nin the colonies, were merely carrying out the commands of Charles II and\r\nJames II, or whether on their own initiative they shaped colonial policy\r\nin accord with domestic policy. In either case it was the Second Stuart\r\nDespotism in England which was responsible for the Andros despotism in\r\nNew England, and for the equally dangerous attack on liberty in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nIt was prophetic of what was to come that Secretary Coventry, in\r\nJanuary, 1678, read to the Committee on Foreign Affairs a series of\r\nproposals concerning Virginia. Three companies of soldiers were to be\r\nleft in the colony, a fort was to be erected \"whereby the King may be\r\nsafe from rebellions,\" all laws were to be sent to England for revision.\r\nThe last proposal was an innovation of serious import.[43] The\r\nVirginians had never questioned the right of the King to veto the acts\r\nof Assembly, but never before had he demanded the right to revise laws\r\nalready on the statute books.\r\n\r\nOf even greater significance was the initiation of bills by the King.\r\nCharles wrote Culpeper that whereas certain laws had been recommended to\r\nhim in Council of which he approved, \"these bills we have caused to be\r\nunder the Great Seal of England, and our will is that the same bills ...\r\nyou shall cause to be considered ... in our Assembly of Virginia ... and\r\nto these bills you do give and declare our royal assent.\" One was an act\r\nof general pardon, one an act for naturalization, and the other an act\r\nfor raising a public revenue.[44]\r\n\r\nThis was accompanied by an attempt to deprive the Assembly of the right\r\nto initiate legislation. Culpeper was commanded to send to the King a\r\ndraft of such bills as he and the Council should think fit to be passed,\r\nso that he could go over them and return them in the form he thought\r\nthey should be enacted in. \"Upon receipt of our commands you shall\r\nsummon an Assembly and propose the said laws for their consent.\"[45]\r\n\r\nAs though this were not enough, Charles demanded the sole power,\r\nheretofore exercised by the Governor, of calling sessions of the\r\nAssembly. \"It is our will and pleasure that for the future no General\r\nAssembly be called without our special directions, but that, upon\r\noccasion, you do acquaint us by letter with the necessity of calling\r\nsuch an Assembly, and pray our consent and directions for their\r\nmeeting.\"[46]\r\n\r\nThe King struck a fatal blow at the control of justice in Virginia by\r\nthe people, by depriving the Assembly of its privilege of acting as the\r\nsupreme court of appeals. \"Our pleasure also is that for the better and\r\nmore equitable administration of justice in our said colony, appeals be\r\nallowed in cases of error from the courts ... to our Governor and our\r\nCouncil there, and to no other court or jurisdiction whatsoever.\"[47]\r\n\r\nAlthough Thomas Culpeper had been too young to fight in the Civil War,\r\nhe donned a suit of armor with breastplate, shoulderpieces, and\r\nbrassarts, to have his portrait painted. But the face is not that of a\r\nwarrior. It is draped by the flowing hair of the Cavalier, has a\r\nprominent nose and a weak mouth with the trace of a sneer. Culpeper had\r\nfollowed Charles into exile, and with the Restoration had expected\r\ncompensation for his losses. But since there was not enough to go round\r\namong all the hungry Cavaliers, the King repaid him at the expense of\r\nhis subjects in Virginia, first with the Arlington-Culpeper grant, and\r\nthen by making him Governor of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the colony was gloomy. The King was determined to\r\noverride the people's rights and make himself absolute. Culpeper was\r\ninterested in filling his pockets. The Green Spring Faction were still\r\nseeking to make good their losses at the expense of the rebels. The\r\ncommon people were suffering from the high taxes and the low price of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nThe King had as much trouble in getting Culpeper to sail for Virginia as\r\nhe had had in making Berkeley come back to England. My Lord had no\r\ndesire to exchange London for the forests of Virginia; he had little\r\ninterest in carrying out his instructions. All he wanted was his salary\r\nand anything he could make out of the Northern Neck. At last, after two\r\nyears of dillydallying, the King told him that unless he sailed at once\r\nhe would remove him as Governor. So in February, 1680, he left the Downs\r\nwith the tobacco fleet.[48]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Jamestown, the members of the Council and other\r\nleading planters flocked around him, eager to give their version of the\r\ntroubles in the colony and to secure his support. When the Council met,\r\nCulpeper was assured that the King had been misinformed on many points\r\nby Moryson and Berry. Philip Ludwell was a loyal, honest servant of the\r\nKing, and should be restored to his place in the Council. Injustice had\r\nbeen done to Colonel Hill, and they begged the new Governor to intercede\r\nfor him.[49]\r\n\r\nAs for the King's rebuke to the Assembly for questioning his right to\r\nseize their records, the Council advised Culpeper not to present it. To\r\ndo so would \"unravel and disturb the good and cheerful settlement we are\r\nnow in by your Excellency's great prudence and conduct.\"[50] So they\r\ninduced him to suspend the rebuke until the King should order to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nCulpeper seems to have brought a degree of peace to the contending\r\nfactions. The act of pardon ended the plundering of the estates of the\r\nformer rebels, and the aggrieved loyalists were encouraged to seek\r\nredress through the Assembly. Colonel Spencer wrote that the \"late\r\ndifferent interests\" had been \"perfectly united to the general\r\nsatisfaction of all.\"\r\n\r\nUnited the people had to be to defend their liberties. When the wealthy\r\nlandholder and the humble owner of but fifty acres, the loyalist and the\r\nformer rebel alike realized that Charles was bent on reducing both\r\nCouncil and Assembly to impotence, their domestic quarrels seemed\r\nunimportant compared to the public danger.\r\n\r\nSince the statehouse at Jamestown was still in ashes, the Assembly of\r\nJune, 1680, crowded into the house of Mrs. Susanne Fisher. Some of the\r\nBurgesses had come on horseback from their James City or Charles City\r\nplantations, others by shallops from the Upper James, still others from\r\nthe far-off Eastern Shore. A sturdy, stubborn group they were, like\r\nother Burgesses before and after them, determined to uphold the rights\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThey were dismayed, then, when Governor Culpeper placed before them the\r\nthree bills prepared and signed by the King. What right has he or the\r\nPrivy Council to introduce bills in this Assembly? they asked. And they\r\nwere especially concerned over the King's demand for a perpetual\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\nThere had existed since 1661 a law for laying a duty of two shillings\r\nfor every hogshead of tobacco exported from the colony. But the revenue\r\nwas to be disposed of by the Assembly. It was they who decided whether\r\nit should be used to pay the Governor's salary, or to defend the colony\r\nagainst the Indians, or for repairing the statehouse, or for paying the\r\nsalaries of the Burgesses. Now the Privy Council took it upon themselves\r\nto draw up a similar act, but differing from the old one in one\r\nall-important respect--it specified that the returns should go, not to\r\nthe Assembly, but \"to the King's most excellent Majesty, his heirs and\r\nsuccessors forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate which followed was long and bitter. Every man in the\r\nAssembly, whether Burgess or Councillor, knew that the King was\r\ndemanding the surrender of their birthright.[51] So they replied to the\r\nGovernor: \"The House do most humbly desire to be excused if they do not\r\ngive their approbation to his Majesty's bill.\"[52] And when the matter\r\nwas brought again before them by the Governor, they refused even to\r\nresume the debate.\r\n\r\nBut Culpeper knew that he would be severely blamed by Charles if he did\r\nnot succeed in forcing this bill through. Returning to the attack he\r\npointed out that the King claimed the right of disposing of all\r\nrevenues. Moreover, they were in no position to defy him, for he had it\r\nin his power to ruin most of them by demanding all arrears of quit\r\nrents. We do not know how many lucrative jobs Culpeper handed out to\r\nbring the reluctant Burgesses around, but he himself tells us that he\r\nwon over one influential member by the promise of a seat in the\r\nCouncil.[53]\r\n\r\nIn the end the King had his way. The Burgesses made two minor\r\namendments, and then passed the bill. When it came before Charles again,\r\nhe vetoed one of these amendments, and allowed the other. A quarter of a\r\ncentury later, when the Board of Trade asked Attorney General Simon\r\nHarcourt and Solicitor General James Montague to pass on the validity of\r\nthe act, they reported that it had been put through irregularly. \"It\r\nwould be wise,\" they said, \"if any part of her Majesty's revenue depends\r\non this act, to have another in its place.\"[54]\r\n\r\nYet the act was permitted to stand, and the cause of self-government in\r\ncolonial Virginia suffered its greatest reverse. No longer could the\r\nAssembly force the Governor to sign this bill or that by refusing to\r\nvote his salary. No longer did they hold a sword over the heads of the\r\nCouncil. It is true that they still retained in part their grip upon\r\nthe purse, since the export duty together with the quit rents seldom met\r\neven the ordinary needs of the government, and were entirely inadequate\r\nin times of emergency. It is this which explains why such notable gains\r\nfor liberty were made during the colonial wars. Yet from this time until\r\nthe Declaration of Independence the Virginia Assembly had to fight the\r\nroyal prerogative with one hand tied behind its back.[55]\r\n\r\nHaving secured the passage of the King's three laws, Culpeper rested on\r\nhis laurels. He seems to have yielded to the plea of the Council not to\r\ndeliver the King's rebuke to the Assembly. If he ever told the Council\r\nof his instruction to initiate bills with their advice and secure the\r\nKing's approval before sending them to the House, they must have argued\r\nthat it was impractical. They had no desire to have representative\r\ngovernment in the colony made a mockery. Were the Burgesses to have the\r\nright of amending bills? they must have asked. If so, would the amended\r\nbills have to go back to England for the King's approval? Under such\r\nconditions, it might take years to enact the simplest laws. So this\r\ninstruction was ignored.\r\n\r\nEqually impractical was it to secure the King's permission before\r\ncalling an Assembly. In case of a sudden emergency it might be fatal to\r\nwait until the Governor had written to Secretary Coventry, until he had\r\ntaken the matter up with his Majesty, until some vessel sailed and had\r\nmade the tedious voyage to Virginia. If the need were the outbreak of\r\nwar with the Indians, half the colony might be scalped before the\r\nAssembly could meet to raise men and money for arms and forts. So\r\nCulpeper ignored this instruction also.\r\n\r\nAs for the instruction to forbid appeals from the General Court to the\r\nAssembly, the Governor kept it to himself. Three years later, at an\r\ninquiry held on his neglect of his office, he explained: \"Having some\r\nthoughts of getting a revenue bill to pass, I was unwilling actually to\r\nrepeal the laws relating thereunto till the next session of Assembly\r\nshould be over, well knowing how infinitely it would trouble them.\"[56]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Assembly had been dismissed Culpeper made ready to return\r\nto England, after having been in Virginia only a few weeks. Yet for his\r\nsupposed services he had been receiving L2,000 a year from the revenues\r\nof the colony ever since the death of Berkeley.[57] Not content with\r\nthis, he contrived to rob the English soldiers who had remained in\r\nVirginia after Bacon's Rebellion of more than L1,000. These men had\r\nreceived no pay for many months, and were discontented and mutinous.[58]\r\nSo the Privy Council gave Culpeper money to satisfy them and the\r\nfamilies on whom they had been quartered. On his arrival he bought up\r\nall the worn Spanish pieces of eight he could find, arbitrarily\r\nproclaimed them legal tender at six shillings, which was a shilling more\r\nthan they were worth, and then paid the soldiers and landlords. But\r\nbefore his salary became due, he restored the ratio to five to one.[59]\r\n\r\nIn 1682 news reached England of a series of tobacco-cutting riots in\r\nVirginia. The glut of tobacco in the English warehouses and its\r\nconsequent low price had convinced the people that a restriction on the\r\noutput was necessary. It was to be a kind of soil bank, though without\r\nthe subsidy. When this failed because Maryland refused to join in, angry\r\nmobs went from plantation to plantation, cutting down the tender plants.\r\nFearing that this might be the beginning of a new rebellion, the Privy\r\nCouncil ordered the reluctant Culpeper to go back at once to suppress\r\nthe riots and punish the ringleaders.[60]\r\n\r\nCulpeper arrived in December, 1682. Finding that the riots were over, he\r\ncontented himself with hanging two of the most notorious of the plant\r\ncutters, and then hastened back to England. By this time Charles had\r\nlost patience with him for his neglect of his government, the Attorney\r\nGeneral was ordered to take action against him, and his commission as\r\nGovernor of Virginia was declared void. In September, 1683, Lord Howard\r\nof Effingham was made Governor in his place.\r\n\r\nEffingham was well fitted to carry out the King's attack on liberty in\r\nVirginia. Deceitful, persistent, unscrupulous, he would have ridden\r\nroughshod over the people's rights had he not encountered the determined\r\nresistance of the House of Burgesses. No sooner had he arrived than the\r\nstruggle began.\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly met in April, 1684, he put on his peer's coronet and\r\nvelvet and ermine robes, and told the Burgesses that he intended to\r\nenforce the King's order to prohibit appeals to the Assembly. This was\r\nreceived with dismay. They appealed to Effingham and the Council to join\r\nthem in an address to the King imploring him to restore a privilege\r\nenjoyed from the earliest times. But in vain. \"It is what I can in no\r\npart admit of,\" was Effingham's curt reply. Since this made the General\r\nCourt the last court of appeals in Virginia, the structure of justice\r\nbecame aristocratic rather than democratic.\r\n\r\nFuture Governors had reason to regret this change, for it added greatly\r\nto the influence of the Council, and the day was not distant when the\r\nCouncil was to become so powerful as to threaten to make the Governor a\r\nmere figurehead. It was the Council which was to be responsible for the\r\ndismissal of Andros and Nicholson. Governor Spotswood, in his bitter\r\nquarrels with the Councillors tried to undermine their power by striking\r\nat their judicial privileges, but he failed, and he too was forced out\r\nof office by their influence.\r\n\r\nEven more alarming to the people than the ending of appeals to the\r\nAssembly was an order from the King that certain causes arising in the\r\ncourts be referred to England for decision. The Burgesses protested.\r\nSuch a thing would be \"grievous and ruinous,\" they said, and would\r\ninvolve delays and great expense. Moreover, they could not find that\r\nappeals to England had been allowed \"from the first settling of the\r\ncolony.\" When Effingham and the Council refused to join them, they sent\r\ntheir petition to the King as the protest of the Lower House alone.[61]\r\n\r\nBut James II, who had succeeded to the throne on the death of Charles in\r\nFebruary, received their appeal with contempt. In the new instructions\r\nto Effingham drawn up in October, 1685, he wrote: \"Whereas ... our\r\nCommittee of Trade and Plantations ... have received from some unknown\r\npersons a paper entitled An Address and Supplication of the General\r\nAssembly of Virginia to the late King ... which you have refused to\r\nrecommend as being unfit ... we cannot but approve of your\r\nproceedings.... And we do further direct you to discountenance such\r\nundue practices for the future, as also the contrivers and promoters\r\nthereof.\"[62]\r\n\r\nAt this dark hour, when American liberty hung in the balance, the\r\nBurgesses were quick to repel any attempt to tax the people without\r\ntheir consent. In May, 1688, they stated that they had received \"many\r\ngrievous complaints\" that unlawful fees had \"under color of his\r\nMajesty's royal authority\" been unjustly imposed upon the people. They\r\nprotested especially against a fee of 200 pounds of tobacco for affixing\r\nthe great seal of the colony, a fee of 30 pounds of tobacco for\r\nrecording surveys of land, and a fee of L5 for escheats.[63]\r\n\r\nAnd they were adamant in refusing repeated demands for permission for\r\nthe Governor and Council by themselves to levy a tax even though a very\r\nsmall one. \"Your Lordships will ... find their total denial that the\r\nGovernor and Council should have any power to lay the least levy to ease\r\nthe necessity for so frequent Assemblys,\" Effingham wrote the Committee\r\nof Trade and Plantations in February, 1686. \"This was propounded by me\r\nto them before his Majesty's instructions came to hand ... but nothing\r\nwould prevail, nor I believe will, unless his Majesty's special command\r\ntherein.\"[64]\r\n\r\nThere was consternation in the Assembly when they learned that the King\r\nwas attempting to build up a revenue independent of the Burgesses by\r\nincreasing the returns from the quit rents. This tax on land, for such\r\nit really was, had always been paid in tobacco. In 1662 the Assembly had\r\nfixed the rate of payment at twopence a pound, which at that time\r\napproximated the current price. But the decline in the value of the leaf\r\nhad greatly lessened the value of the returns. So in 1684 the King\r\nordered Effingham to accept only specie, \"that is to say in money and\r\nnot in tobacco or in any other commodity.\"[65] Since tobacco was then\r\nselling at a halfpenny a pound, this would have quadrupled the value of\r\nthe quit rents, imposed a heavy burden on the impoverished country, and\r\nstrengthened the authority of the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe controversy over this matter led to another and a more serious\r\nencroachment on the rights of the people, for when the Assembly refused\r\nto repeal the law of 1662, the King voided it by proclamation. Having\r\nheard that \"persons go about ... imposing bad tobacco upon our\r\ncollectors at the rate of 2d per pound, under pretence of an act of\r\nAssembly ... we have thought fit to repeal the said act.\"[66] Upon\r\nreceipt of this order Effingham sent for the Burgesses to meet him in\r\nthe Council Chamber. When they filed in he soon found that they were in\r\nno mood to yield. Not only did they again refuse to repeal the law of\r\n1662, but they \"rudely and boldly disputed the King's authority in\r\nrepealing laws by proclamation.\"[67] Moreover, they pointed out, it was\r\nimpossible to pay in pounds or shillings since there were not enough in\r\nthe entire colony. This argument was unanswerable, and in the end the\r\nGovernor was forced to assent to a compromise by which the tax was to be\r\npaid in tobacco, but at the rate of one penny per pound instead of two.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the theories of government held by Charles and James\r\non the one hand, and the people of the colony on the other was brought\r\ninto focus by a dispute over the King's right to revive a law by\r\nrepealing a law which had repealed it. When James revived a law of 1680\r\nconcerning attorneys by annulling the repealing law of 1682, the\r\nBurgesses rose as one man in angry protest. \"A law may as well receive\r\nits beginning by proclamation as such a revival,\" they said. \"Some\r\nGovernor may be sent to govern us who under the pretence of the liberty\r\nhe hath to construe prerogative and stretch it as far as he pleaseth,\r\nmay by proclamation revive all the laws that for their great\r\ninconveniences to the country have been repealed through forty years\r\nsince.\"[68]\r\n\r\nThe Councillors as well as the Burgesses must have been startled when\r\nEffingham in reply told them that the King had the right to nullify or\r\nrevive what laws he pleased, since the only authority the Assembly had\r\nto legislate at all rested on a grant from the Throne. They had been\r\nunder the impression that the right of the people to make laws through\r\ntheir representatives was inherent in all Englishmen. If it were a grant\r\nfrom the King, which the King might at will withdraw, liberty in America\r\nrested on a shaky basis indeed. In an address to Effingham they stated\r\nthat they did not dare \"to say what is prerogative and what is not,\"[69]\r\nbut they made it clear that when prerogative was stretched so far that\r\nit threatened to enslave them, they would resist by every means within\r\ntheir power.\r\n\r\nDespots throughout the years have feared a free press, and have either\r\nprohibited printing or controlled it for their own purposes. So it was\r\nin keeping with the spirit of the Second Stuart Despotism that Charles\r\nand James would allow no press in Virginia. It was in 1682 that John\r\nBuckner, a prominent merchant and landowner of Gloucester County, and a\r\nmember of the House of Burgesses, employed William Nuthead to set up a\r\nprinting establishment at Jamestown. But they had picked an inauspicious\r\ntime for their venture. Nuthead was ordered to appear before the Council\r\n\"to answer for his presumption in printing the acts of Assembly ... and\r\nseveral other papers without licence.\" The Council ordered that \"for\r\nprevention of all troubles and inconveniences that may be occasioned\r\nthrough the liberty of a press ... Mr. John Buckner and William Nuthead\r\nthe printer enter into bond for one hundred pounds sterling ... that\r\nfrom and after the date hereof nothing be printed by either of them ...\r\nin this colony until the signification of his Majesty's pleasure shall\r\nbe known.\"[70]\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's pleasure therein was a foregone conclusion. \"Whereas we\r\nhave taken notice of the inconvenience that may arise by the liberty of\r\nprinting in Virginia,\" stated Charles in his instructions to Effingham,\r\n\"no person is to be permitted to use any press for printing upon any\r\noccasion whatsoever.\"[71] So Nuthead took the press to Maryland and for\r\nnearly half a century Virginia was without a printer.[72]\r\n\r\nThe quartering of troops upon the people has been a serious grievance\r\nwherever it has been practiced. People object to having rough soldiers\r\nthrust into their homes, to disrupt their daily life, or perhaps to\r\ncreate disorders. When the British troops sent over to suppress Bacon's\r\nRebellion were quartered on the people, there were bitter complaints.\r\n\"Instead of being a guard and safety\" to us as was intended, \"they have\r\nby their long stay and ill behavior not only been totally useless, but\r\ndangerous,\" and the greatest of our terrors.[73] To make matters worse,\r\ncomplaints came in to the Assembly from Isle of Wight, York, James City,\r\nand Nansemond Counties that payments for quarters were in arrears by six\r\nmonths or more. So it was with thanksgiving that the people received the\r\nannouncement that the money to pay for the quarters had arrived from\r\nEngland together with orders to disband the troops.[74]\r\n\r\nEffingham was even more brazen than Berkeley in using the patronage\r\nopenly to force obedience to the King. Berkeley ruled chiefly by\r\nrewarding those who did as he told them; Effingham by punishing all who\r\nopposed him. To acquiesce in everything he proposed was the only way for\r\none to retain one's job. William Sherwood and Colonel Thomas Milner, for\r\nforwarding an address of the Burgesses to the Privy Council, were\r\ndismissed from office. Mr. Arthur Allen was \"turned out of all\r\nemployment, civil and military\" to his great loss, \"he being a surveyor\r\nof land at that time.\"[75] Effingham himself explains why. He was \"a\r\ngreat promoter of those differences between me and the Assembly\r\nconcerning the King's negative voice ... as not thinking it fit that\r\nthose who are peevishly opposite to his Majesty's interest should have\r\nany advantage by his favor.\"[76]\r\n\r\nAnother prominent member of the House of Burgesses, Mr. Charles\r\nScarburgh, was \"turned out of all employment, and as a mark of his\r\nLordship's displeasure, a command was sent to the clerk of the county to\r\nraze his name out of the records as a justice of peace.\"[77] Mr. William\r\nAnderson, Scarburgh's colleague from Accomac County, must have been even\r\nmore active in opposing the Governor, for when the session of 1688 was\r\nover he had him \"put in the common jail,\" where he was \"detained seven\r\nmonths without trial, though often prayed for.... Nor could he obtain\r\nthe benefit of habeas corpus.\"[78]\r\n\r\n\"From whence the people conclude these severities are inflicted rather\r\nas a terror to others than for any personal crimes of their own,\" it was\r\nsaid, \"and is of such ruinous consequence that either the public or\r\nparticular interests must fall, for if none oppose, the country must\r\nlanguish under the severity of the government, or fly into mutiny to\r\nsave themselves from starving. If any do appear more zealous in\r\nprosecuting the country's complaints they know what to expect. It being\r\nobservable that none has been thus punished but those who were forward\r\nin the Assembly to oppose the encroachments on the people, and promote\r\nthe complaint to England, being out of hope of relief on the\r\nplace.\"[79]\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, as in England, there was much dissatisfaction at the\r\naccession of the Roman Catholic James II. Many would have preferred\r\nCharles' illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth. When news came that he\r\nhad raised the standard of revolt, had landed in Dorset, had gathered an\r\narmy of rustics, and was marching on London, some did not hesitate to\r\nexpress their sympathy. Effingham wrote that \"so many took liberty of\r\nspeech upon the rebellion ... that I was fearful it would have produced\r\nthe same here.\"[80] But when he issued a proclamation forbidding \"false,\r\nseditious, and factious discourse and rumors,\" and made \"some examples,\"\r\nquiet was restored. The defeat of the rebels at Sedgemoor, the bloody\r\nrevenge taken by James, and the execution of Monmouth ended all hope for\r\nthe time being.\r\n\r\nBut Effingham's proclamation could not prevent news of what was\r\nhappening in England from reaching the people. In Ireland James was\r\nrecruiting a Catholic army under a Catholic general. At home he was\r\nreplacing civil and military officers by Catholics. To remove all\r\nrestrictions on Catholics he issued declarations of indulgence, giving\r\nfreedom of worship to dissenters and Catholics. He converted two Oxford\r\ncolleges into Catholic seminaries, and ousted the Fellows of Magdalen to\r\nmake room for Catholic successors.\r\n\r\nThese events were soon reflected in Virginia. It was noted that when\r\nimportant offices in the government became vacant, Effingham filled them\r\nwith Catholics. Both of his appointees to the Council were members of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church--Colonel Isaac Allerton and Colonel John\r\nArmistead. That several justices of the peace refused to take the oath\r\nof allegiance \"through scruple of conscience\" in 1691, after James had\r\nbeen deposed, shows that the Governor tried also to pack the county\r\ncourts with Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe people watched these developments with resentment, mixed with fear.\r\nThe shudder of horror which had gone through England a few years before,\r\nwhen Titus Oates accused the Jesuits of a \"hellish plot\" to fire London,\r\nconquer the country with Irish and French armies, and massacre the\r\nProtestants, was still fresh in men's minds. Perhaps his story is not\r\nfalse after all, it was whispered. Perhaps the plan may still be carried\r\nout. Think of what has just happened in France, where thousands of men\r\nand women, for refusing to give up their faith were driven into exile or\r\nthrown into loathsome prisons with criminals, starved, and beaten. Are\r\nwe sure that it will not be our turn next?\r\n\r\nThe Assembly which met in April, 1688, reflected the ugly mood of the\r\npeople. They were determined to redress the grievances which poured in\r\nfrom one county after another. The Governor's appeal for aid for New\r\nYork and for a bill to prohibit the exportation of loose tobacco\r\nreceived scant consideration. \"Debates of grievances jostled out most\r\nother matters,\" reported Nicholas Spencer.[81] When the Council\r\nrequested a conference on the tobacco bill, the House countered with a\r\nproposal for a conference on the people's wrongs. But their message was\r\ncouched in such bitter terms that the Council thought \"no success could\r\nbe expected from a conference agitated with heat and resolvedness.\"[82]\r\n\r\nNor would the Council join the Burgesses in an address to Effingham for\r\nredress of \"the many grievous oppressions this poor country at present\r\ngroans under.\" Thereupon the House drew up a petition to the King which\r\nthey entrusted to Philip Ludwell to deliver. Before James could reply,\r\nhe was forced to flee from England, and it was only in February, 1689,\r\nthat the petition came before the Council of State.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation when Effingham left Virginia \"for recovery of his\r\nhealth by change of air.\" He may have realized also that the air of\r\nVirginia was becoming unhealthful for him in more sense than one, for\r\nhad he not left it is possible that the people might have risen in arms\r\nand sent him home. Several years later, when Francis Nicholson asked the\r\nCouncil whether \"if his Excellency my Lord Effingham had stayed\" the\r\ncountry would not have been in trouble? they replied in the affirmative.\r\n\"The country were in great dissatisfaction ...and there was great cause\r\nto doubt that some disturbance would have been.\"[83]\r\n\r\nBut it was only in the spring of 1689, some months after his departure,\r\nthat an uprising actually occurred. Then it was touched off by a weird\r\nstory told by a stray Indian to some of the settlers on the northern\r\nfrontier of a plot by Jesuits and Indians to attack Virginia and\r\nMaryland. No less than 10,000 Senecas and 9,000 Nanticocks were under\r\narms, he said, ready to cut off all the Protestants. As the report\r\nspread from plantation to plantation, the outlying families fled in\r\nterror, while men gathered volunteers by beat of drum. We must defend\r\nourselves in arms, they said, since no reliance can be placed on the\r\nCouncil or even on the county magistrates, for most of them are\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\nThe Council thought the story of the Catholic plot \"only a gloss to\r\ntheir rebellious purposes.\" In October, 1688, James had sent word to\r\nEffingham that William of Orange was preparing to invade England, and\r\nhad ordered him to place the colony in a posture of defence.[84] It was\r\nto seize this opportunity to rise against the government, rather than\r\nthe imaginary Indian plot, that had made them take up arms, the Council\r\nthought. Preferring not to take sides in a matter which could be settled\r\nonly in England, they arrested some of the ringleaders.[85] But when,\r\napparently on the same day, a letter came to hand from the Privy\r\nCouncil, announcing that William and Mary had been proclaimed joint\r\nmonarchs of England, order was instantly restored. On April 26, 1688,\r\ntheir Majesties were proclaimed before the courthouse door at Jamestown.\r\n\r\nThere were two things which the colonial Virginians dreaded--despotism\r\nand the tomahawk. And it is significant that both were factors in the\r\ntwo uprisings of the seventeenth century. In Bacon's Rebellion the\r\npeople demanded, not only protection from the savages, but an end to\r\nBerkeley's misgovernment. If the Council was right in their\r\ninterpretation of the disorders of 1688, they, like the ousting of\r\nAndros in New England, were a part of the Glorious Revolution. The\r\nCouncil afterwards took great credit for suppressing the disorders, but\r\none can only surmise whether the people would have remained quiet had\r\nnot James been overthrown. We must not permit the Indian terror to blind\r\nus to the fact that the rebellions of 1676 and 1688 were both in defense\r\nof liberty.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] CO389.6, pp. 113, 137.\r\n\r\n[2] H.

No sooner had James fled than a committee\r\nof the Commons drew up a \"Declaration of Rights,\" to secure the liberty\r\nof the subjects and the power of Parliament, which was accepted by both\r\nHouses and by William. Parliament then declared William and Mary joint\r\nmonarchs. Mary could argue that as the child of James II she was the\r\nrightful heir to the Throne, but William could make no such claim. So\r\nthe old Tory doctrine of divine right was officially repudiated, and the\r\nmonarch henceforth ruled by the consent of the nation. The Revolution\r\nopened a new epoch of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia were well aware that they were to share in this\r\nliberty. In an address to the King and Queen, the Assembly gave them\r\nheartfelt thanks for \"so magnanimously exposing\" their persons in\r\nrescuing them, their religion, laws, and liberties from the twin evils\r\nof slavery and popery. They begged them, while extending their justice\r\nand goodness over the English nation, not to forget their faithful\r\nsubjects in Virginia. They, too, were \"descended of Englishmen,\" and had\r\nthe right to enjoy \"the just and lawful liberties and privileges of free\r\nborn\" Englishmen.[1]\r\n\r\nIn this they were not disappointed. During the next seventy-five years\r\nthey advanced steadily along the road to liberty. From time to time they\r\nhad to contend with despotically inclined Governors, but these men,\r\nprior to the reign of George III, in assailing the rights of the people\r\nacted on their own initiative rather than at the command of the King. By\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century Virginia had become in internal\r\naffairs practically a self-governing dominion. People began to say\r\nopenly that final authority rested, not with the King, but with the\r\npeople, and that governments derived their powers from the consent of\r\nthe governed.\r\n\r\nThis trend was noted early in the eighteenth century. As early as 1706\r\nColonel Quary warned the English government of what was coming. A few\r\nyears later Governor Spotswood wrote: \"If the ancient and legal rights\r\nof the Crown must give place to the later customs of an infant colony,\r\nespecially if the practice and usage which ... men would introduce shall\r\nbe of greater force, the prince's power and authority must daily lose\r\nground here.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIt was a slow, almost imperceptible process. But year after year the\r\nBurgesses whittled away at the powers of the Governor, until, after the\r\npassage of decades, the change became apparent to all. Berkeley,\r\nCulpeper, and Effingham had exercised almost dictatorial powers; Gooch,\r\nFauquier, and Botetourt ate out of the hands of the Assembly. Whereas\r\nthe Governors of the seventeenth century commanded and threatened, those\r\nof the mid-eighteenth century pleaded. On one occasion Governor Fauquier\r\nwrote the Lords of Trade that he had signed a bill, not because he\r\napproved of it, but because had he vetoed it he \"must have despaired of\r\never gaining any influence either in the Council or House of Burgesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe shouting and firing of guns in celebration of the accession of\r\nWilliam and Mary had hardly ended when the Virginians turned their\r\nthoughts to the long desired new charter. The Bill of Rights gave them\r\nas well as Englishmen residing in England guarantees of liberty, but\r\nthey had distinctive interests which they thought ought to be protected.\r\nAppointing Jeffrey Jeffreys to manage the affair, the Council and\r\nBurgesses sent him L200 for expenses and suggested that he call to his\r\nsupport any Virginians who chanced to be in London. That the art of\r\nlobbying was as well understood in the seventeenth century as it is\r\ntoday is shown by their instruction \"to procure the assistance ... of\r\nthe nobility and such as have offices at Whitehall and other men of note\r\n... to be mediators with their Majesties.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe proposed charter was to confirm the authority of the Assembly. At\r\nfirst sight this would seem to be unnecessary since the Assembly had\r\nbeen in existence since 1619, and had been recognized by James I,\r\nCharles I, Charles II, and James II. But the attempts to undermine its\r\nauthority during the Second Stuart Despotism had convinced the people\r\nthat its very existence might be threatened by some future King.\r\n\r\nThey asked, also, that in the charter it be promised \"that no tax be\r\nmade upon this country but by the consent of the Assembly.\" The people\r\nhad been deeply disappointed that a like promise had been left out of\r\nthe charter of 1676. They took for granted that Parliament would not\r\nviolate their rights as Englishmen by taxing them, but it would have\r\ncomforted them to have it down in black and white. How necessary such a\r\nguarantee was became apparent eighty-five years later with the passage\r\nof the Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nThe charter was to promise, also, that the King and Queen would continue\r\nto the Virginians and their descendants their rights as natural born\r\nsubjects of England, and that as \"near as may be\" they should be\r\ngoverned after the same method as Englishmen, and \"have the full benefit\r\nof the Great Charter and all other laws and statutes indulging the\r\nliberty of the subjects.\" Jeffreys was to ask that \"the ancient method\"\r\nof making appeals from the General Court to the Assembly be restored,\r\nsince appeals to the Privy Council were in most cases impractical\r\nbecause of the expense involved and the difficulty of bringing\r\n\"evidences, papers, and other records\" to England.[4]\r\n\r\nWe do not know why the application for the charter was dropped. It may\r\nhave been because Jeffreys found that it would not meet with success, or\r\nthe Assembly may have been persuaded that a charter was unnecessary\r\nunder the liberal administration of the new monarchs.\r\n\r\nFrancis Nicholson, who had been selected to serve as Lieutenant Governor\r\nduring Effingham's absence, arrived in Virginia in May, 1690. The choice\r\nwas unfortunate. This man was a strange mixture of contrasting\r\ncharacteristics. A devoted Church of England man and a friend of the\r\nclergy, he was at times shockingly profane. One of the patrons of the\r\nCollege of William and Mary, and the founder of the city of\r\nWilliamsburg, he was unscrupulous in trampling on the rights of all who\r\nopposed him. Seeking the admiration of those with whom he was\r\nassociated, he alienated his best friends by his fits of uncontrollable\r\ntemper. Capable of acts of great generosity, he was accused of being\r\nparsimonious in his private life.\r\n\r\nNicholson's treatment of the Reverend Mr. Slaughter was typical. He and\r\na certain Captain James Moodie had gone to York to a funeral. \"The\r\nceremony and sermon being over,\" Moodie relates, \"he went out of church,\r\nwhere he saw and heard the Governor in the most outrageous passion that\r\nhe ever saw, swearing the most horrid oaths and most bitter imprecations\r\nagainst Mr. Slaughter, the minister of that parish, calling the said\r\nSlaughter rogue, rascal, knave, and all the base billingsgate language\r\nthat could be in the basest of men's mouths, shaking his horsewhip and\r\nthreatening to beat the said minister therewith, and to pull his gown\r\nover his ears.\"[5] Apparently Mr. Slaughter had brought on this torrent\r\nof abuse by asking for a fee for the funeral sermon.\r\n\r\nNicholson's conduct as Deputy Governor of New York under Sir Edmund\r\nAndros at the time of the Glorious Revolution was not such as to inspire\r\nconfidence that he would do well in Virginia. With no official orders to\r\nproclaim William and Mary, and with the people ready to rush to arms,\r\nwhat was needed was tact and conciliatory measures. Instead, Nicholson\r\nflew into a rage and talked about suppressing the \"uproar and\r\nrebellion.\" It was rumored that he planned to burn the city, and that\r\nthe people were to be betrayed and murdered. When some armed men, under\r\nthe German merchant Jacob Leisler, seized the fort, Nicholson deserted\r\nhis post and took ship for England.[6]\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the Council after Nicholson arrived at Jamestown\r\nwas held on January 3, 1690. After he had shown his commission, he and\r\nthe Councillors went to the courthouse where it was read to the people\r\nassembled there. If the Virginians had been prejudiced against the new\r\nLieutenant Governor by reports of his conduct in New York, they could\r\nnot have been reassured by his personal appearance. It was said that\r\nwhen he made a bow to the ladies, he looked like a goose picking up\r\nstraws.\r\n\r\nNicholson began his administration with a due regard to the influence of\r\nthe Council. He had noticed that some of them held large tracts of land\r\nfor which they paid no quit rents, and he pointed out, in a letter to\r\nthe Earl of Nottingham, that it would strengthen the hands of the\r\nGovernor if they were forced to pay up. \"But the great men being\r\nconcerned, I dare not venture to put any new method in execution\r\nwithout an instruction.\"[7]\r\n\r\nHe was equally cautious at first to defer to the Council in making\r\nappointments. When the sheriff of Middlesex died, he asked those\r\nCouncillors who lived in that part of the country to nominate his\r\nsuccessor. When they suggested Mr. Robert Dudley, Nicholson at once gave\r\nhim a commission. At the same meeting he pointed out that the regular\r\ntime for naming sheriffs and coroners was at hand, and asked that the\r\nCouncillors be prepared to make nominations at their next meeting.[8]\r\n\r\nBut it was not long before he began to use the patronage to build up his\r\nown power under the guise of defending the royal prerogative. When the\r\noath of supremacy was tendered the members of the Council, Richard Lee,\r\nIsaac Allerton, and John Armistead refused to take it because they were\r\nRoman Catholics. Nicholson filled one vacancy by naming Attorney General\r\nEdmund Jenings. He then sent a list of four other prominent men to the\r\nKing and Queen, with the suggestion that they select the other two from\r\nit. Three of the four deserved well, he pointed out, because in the\r\nHouse of Burgesses they had been \"for their Majesties' interest.\"\r\nColonel Thomas Milner, the Speaker, behaved very well too, \"but he hath\r\nnot estate enough to be a Councillor. But he should have promise of some\r\nplace of profit.\"[9]\r\n\r\nWe have no evidence that Nicholson tried to build up a party in the\r\nHouse of Burgesses by distributing sheriff's places to the members. But\r\nhe did try to ingratiate himself by hobnobbing with them and \"admitting\"\r\nthem daily to his table. This he did, he said, in order to keep a good\r\nagreement with them for their Majesties' service and advance the public\r\naffairs of the country, and not to propose or gain anything to be done\r\nin the Assembly. But the fact that he used the same technique to gain\r\npower during his second administration, makes his protestations seem\r\nrather hollow.\r\n\r\nNicholson claimed great success for his administration. He had\r\nbefriended the clergy and bettered their condition, he pointed out, he\r\nhad \"looked after their Majesties' revenue,\" and left it in excellent\r\ncondition, he had reorganized the militia. But he admitted, in fact\r\nboasted, that he had defended the royal prerogative on all occasions. He\r\nmight have added that he had given Commissary Blair his wholehearted\r\nsupport in his efforts to found a college.\r\n\r\nWhen Nicholson heard that Effingham had retired as Governor General of\r\nVirginia, and that he had been succeeded by Sir Edmund Andros, he was\r\nbitterly disappointed. As Lieutenant Governor under Effingham, he\r\nthought that when the government became vacant it was his due. He was\r\nespecially disgruntled that Andros had been selected since he had\r\nagainst him a long standing pique. Yet he made the best of the\r\nsituation, greeted Andros upon his arrival, and, at the head of the\r\nJames City County militia, escorted him to Jamestown \"through the\r\nseveral counties which were in his way.\"[10]\r\n\r\nIt must have been with apprehension that the Virginians received Sir\r\nEdmund, for reports of his despotism in New England had preceded him.\r\nThey had heard that there he ruled like an Eastern despot, promulgating\r\nlaws, levying taxes without the consent of the Assemblies, placing men\r\nunder arrest and denying them the right of _habeas corpus_. And they\r\nknew that the Bostonians had at last captured him, put him aboard a\r\nvessel, and shipped him back to England. The Virginians were ready to\r\noffer stiff resistance should he try to rule them with a harsh hand.\r\n\r\nSo they were surprised to find Andros a mild mannered man, who not only\r\nmade no attack on their liberty, but tried to live in peace with both\r\nCouncil and Burgesses. He seems not to have used the patronage to build\r\nup his power, nor to have broken the grip of the House on the purse by\r\ndemanding large fees; he would have allowed the Burgesses to appoint\r\ntheir own clerk had his instructions permitted it, and he carefully kept\r\noff the explosive subject of the arrears of quit rents. Edward Randolph\r\nsummed it up by saying that he had \"mightily gained upon the Council and\r\nchief men in the country by his even temper.\"[11]\r\n\r\nNothing can illustrate better the progress made in self-government in\r\nVirginia since the overthrow of James II than the Burgesses' cavalier\r\ntreatment of two bills recommended by the King and Queen. The first, a\r\nbill to prohibit the exportation of loose tobacco, was greatly desired\r\nby the English merchants. The other, a bill to establish ports in the\r\nVirginia rivers, had been passed in 1688 by the Assembly, and was now\r\nreturned for certain revisions before becoming law. The Burgesses\r\npromptly voted down both measures. \"The appointment of ports and\r\nenjoining the landing and shipping of all goods ... from the same will\r\n... be very injurious and burdensome,\" they said. There was a long\r\ndebate on the question of prohibiting the exportation of loose tobacco,\r\nbut this bill too failed to pass. Andros was deeply concerned at this\r\ndisregard of the royal wishes, but when the Council advised him that\r\nnothing more could be done with the Burgesses, he dissolved them.[12]\r\n\r\nThe British government also decided that it was best not to press the\r\nmatter. In 1695 Andros spoke of the King's \"goodness\" in dispensing with\r\nhis prerogative \"to establish ports without the consent of the Assembly,\r\nand leaving it to our choice, and also in waiving the prohibition of\r\nbulk tobacco so earnestly desired in England because it was found not\r\npleasing here.\" But the victory of the Burgesses riled Edward Randolph.\r\n\"They are full of conceit, and fancy themselves as great as the House of\r\nCommons in England,\" he said in disgust.[13]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the King was so lenient with the Assembly because he\r\nwanted them to vote men and money to assist New York in her struggle\r\nwith the French and Indians. Andros did his best, pointing out that New\r\nYork was a bulwark for Virginia, and that if she fell the war cry would\r\nsoon be heard on the Virginia frontier. The Burgesses were not\r\nconvinced. The situation in New York was not so desperate as had been\r\nrepresented; they denied that New York was the \"bulwark and defense of\r\nVirginia\"; they were at heavy expense to guard their own frontier. It\r\nwas characteristic of Andros that he asked the Council to reply for him.\r\nThe Councillors at heart were no doubt as reluctant as the Burgesses to\r\nsend aid to New York, but they were in the position of royal advocates\r\nand put up the best argument they could. Yet the session ended without\r\nanything being done.[14]\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly met in 1695, Andros had better success. He had been\r\ninstructed by the King to send a quota of men from the Virginia militia\r\nwhenever the Governor of New York asked for them, he said. This alarmed\r\nthe Burgesses. They thought it would not only weaken the defense of\r\nVirginia by taking away so many men, but would so frighten the young\r\nfreemen that many would desert their wives and children and leave the\r\ncolony. In the end they compromised by voting L500 in lieu of men.[15]\r\nThis Andros was forced to accept, though by so doing he brought on\r\nhimself a reprimand from the Committee of Trade.[16]\r\n\r\nIt is strange that Andros, who was so moderate in his dealings with the\r\nHouse of Burgesses, and declared that he never thought himself better\r\nthan when he had them about him to consult for the good of the country,\r\nshould have bearded them on one of their most sensitive points--the\r\nappointment of a Treasurer. In 1691 the Assembly passed two laws, one\r\nfor levying a poll tax, and one laying a duty on liquors, both of which\r\nwere to be \"paid by the collectors thereof to the Treasurer.\" Included\r\nin the act was the naming of Colonel Edward Hill as Treasurer.[17]\r\n\r\nA year later, when Nicholson gave him a lucrative job as collector, Hill\r\nhad to vacate this office, since it was unlawful for the same man to\r\nhold both. To act as Treasurer until the Assembly convened, the Governor\r\nnamed one of the Council, Henry Whiting. When the Burgesses met they\r\nquestioned Whiting's authority, but he satisfied them by showing them\r\nhis commission. They then passed a bill to name a permanent Treasurer,\r\nbut the Council, probably at Andros' urging, refused to concur. \"The\r\nGovernor would never consent to the Assembly's appointing their own\r\nTreasurer but would rather lose a tax than suffer them to do so,\" James\r\nBlair testified. But, he added: \"This makes them suspicious and more\r\nunwilling to raise money.\"[18]\r\n\r\nWhiting held the office until his death, which occurred probably in\r\nSeptember, 1694. Then, for several years, there seems to have been no\r\nTreasurer. But the Burgesses were merely biding their time. Their\r\nopportunity came in 1699. The old statehouse at Jamestown had burned\r\ndown, and there was urgent need for an appropriation to build a new one.\r\nThey passed a bill placing a duty on the importation of servants and\r\nslaves, and laying a levy by poll, the revenue from both to be paid\r\ninto the hands of the Treasurer for financing a new Capitol. Since there\r\nwas no Treasurer they included in the act the appointment of Colonel\r\nRobert Carter to that office. The Governor and Council, realizing that\r\nthey could not have the Capitol without the Treasurer, yielded.[19]\r\n\r\nThe undoing of Andros was his quarrel with the Reverend James Blair,\r\nCommissary for the Bishop of London in Virginia. When this rugged\r\nScotsman came to the colony he found conditions in the Church far from\r\nsatisfactory. Since there was no college in the colony the parishes were\r\nentirely dependent upon England for their ministers. The dispersal of\r\nthe people was such that if a parish were large enough to provide the\r\nrector with an adequate living, it was too large for him to minister to\r\nproperly. Some parishes extended forty miles or more along the banks of\r\nthe great Virginia rivers, the minister was usually too poor to have a\r\nlibrary or to marry. Since English clergymen were reluctant to come over\r\nunder such conditions, there were many vacant parishes. Often the\r\nvestries in desperation were forced to accept any that offered\r\nthemselves, however unsuitable. There were many able and pious ministers\r\nin Virginia, but some were of inferior ability, and a few were a\r\ndisgrace to their calling. And it was inevitable that amid the woods and\r\ntobacco fields of a new country they should neglect many features of the\r\nliturgy--the use of vestments, the observance of the saints' days,\r\nburial in consecrated ground, etc.\r\n\r\nWith the enthusiastic support of the Bishop of London and of Governor\r\nNicholson, Blair had worked out a plan of reform. He would found a\r\ncollege to educate young Virginians for the ministry; he would secure an\r\nact of Assembly increasing the ministers' salary; he would enforce\r\necclesiastical discipline; he would give the clergy a voice in the\r\ngovernment by procuring a seat in the Council for the Commissary. Going\r\nto England, he gained the backing of the Archbishop of Canterbury and\r\nother prelates, and through them of King William and Queen Mary.[20]\r\n\r\nTheir Majesties granted a charter for the college, permitted it to be\r\nnamed William and Mary, gave L1,985.14.10 out of the quit rent fund,\r\n10,000 acres of land, the revenue of one pence a pound on tobacco\r\nexported from Virginia to any other colony, and a salary for the\r\nCommissary from the quit rents. So Blair returned in triumph and took\r\nhis seat beside the great men of the Council. But it was a triumph which\r\nwon him the enmity of Andros. The Governor, no doubt, was jealous of his\r\ninfluence in high circles in England, and he viewed with alarm the\r\ndiversion from the use of the government to the college and the clergy\r\nof urgently needed funds. With the opening of the year 1694 the\r\ngovernment was facing a deficit with no way of meeting it except by the\r\nhated levy by poll, or by drawing on the quit rents.\r\n\r\nSoon Blair was complaining that Andros was trying to obstruct his\r\nreforms for the clergy. There must have been stormy scenes in the\r\nCouncil meetings, with Blair hurling accusations at the Governor, and\r\nthe latter denying them. The President of the College \"could not be\r\nobliged by all endeavors to contain himself within bounds,\" wrote Andros\r\nto Secretary Shrewsbury. \"His restless comport I ever passed by till the\r\nwhole Council ... faulting him as unfit to be in the Council, I thought\r\nit my duty ... to suspend him.\"[21]\r\n\r\nBut Andros did not reckon on Blair's influence in England. Undoubtedly\r\nthe Commissary wrote the Bishop of London of his suspension, and the\r\nBishop complained to the Lords of Trade. In due time Andros received a\r\nrebuke from the King. He had appointed Blair to the Council \"the better\r\nto enable him to promote and carry on\" the \"good and useful\" work of\r\nfounding a college. Now he found that his gracious intentions had been\r\ndiscouraged by his suspension. \"Our will and pleasure is that forthwith\r\nupon the receipt hereof you take off the said suspension.\"[22] It was a\r\nbitter humiliation for Andros when, in August, 1696, Blair produced the\r\nKing's letter and resumed his seat.[23] So bitter, in fact, that he\r\ndared a second time to oust the hated Commissary. At a meeting of the\r\nCouncil in April, 1697, Blair asked whether a recent act of Parliament\r\ndid not debar him from sitting in the General Court since he was a\r\nnative of Scotland. Whereupon the Council, with a promptness he probably\r\ndid not expect, voted that not only did it do so, but that it made him\r\nineligible for the Council as well.[24]\r\n\r\nBlair's answer was to take ship for England, there to lay his complaints\r\nbefore the English prelates and through them before the Board of Trade.\r\nTo the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Salisbury, and the Bishop\r\nof London he undoubtedly poured out his complaints of Andros--that he\r\nwas an enemy of the college, that he did not support the efforts to\r\nsecure better livings for the clergy, that he had disobeyed the King's\r\nexpress orders to keep him in the Council. This ecclesiastical lobby was\r\ntoo much for Sir Edmund. Seeing the handwriting on the wall, he wrote\r\nthat he wished to come home because of ill health. On May 31, 1698, his\r\nresignation was accepted and Francis Nicholson named to succeed him as\r\nGovernor General.[25]\r\n\r\nWhen Andros bade Jamestown goodbye and set sail for England, a full\r\ndecade had passed since the Glorious Revolution, time sufficient for one\r\nto judge its effect upon self-government in Virginia. Some of the losses\r\nof the Second Stuart Despotism had not been regained. The act of 1680\r\ngiving the Crown a perpetual revenue had not been repealed; the judicial\r\npowers of the Assembly had not been restored; the efforts to secure a\r\ncharter for the colony had been abandoned; the Burgesses had not\r\nregained the right to name their clerk.\r\n\r\nYet the gains far outweighed these failures. Of first importance was it\r\nthat the Assembly itself had been preserved with most of its rights and\r\nprivileges. It still could initiate legislation, it alone could initiate\r\nmoney bills, it could determine the uses of all appropriated funds, it\r\ncould appoint the Treasurer. The petitions of the Assembly to the Throne\r\nwere no longer cast aside with scorn as in the days of Charles II and\r\nJames II, but were given careful consideration. The battle for liberty\r\nhad not yet been won, many bitter struggles lay ahead, but the gains\r\nmade under the mild rule of King William and Queen Mary were vital to\r\nthe eventual victory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1660-1693: 370.\r\n\r\n[2] CO5-1318.\r\n\r\n[3] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1660-1693: 352.\r\n\r\n[4] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1660-1693: 352.\r\n\r\n[5] CO5-1314, Doc. 9.\r\n\r\n[6] _Documentary history of New York_ 2: 25, 31, 42, 181-183.\r\n\r\n[7] CO5-1306, Doc. 64.\r\n\r\n[8] _Executive journals of the Council_ I: 158.\r\n\r\n[9] CO5-1306, Doc. 41.\r\n\r\n[10] _Sainsbury papers_ 5: 100.\r\n\r\n[11] A.

Nicholson's hearty\r\nsupport for his plans to found a college and better the condition of the\r\nclergy when he was Lieutenant Governor, made the Commissary eager to\r\nhave him back. So when Andros resigned, he used his influence with the\r\nBishop of London, who was one of the Commissioners of Trade, to have him\r\nmade his successor.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that one identified with the interests of Virginia\r\nshould have foisted on the colony one of the worst Governors in its\r\nhistory. But at the time Blair seems to have permitted the man's good\r\nqualities--his undoubted ability, his energy, and his devotion to the\r\nChurch--to blind him to his many faults. Blair himself admitted this\r\nlater after he came into violent conflict with Nicholson, and wrote to\r\nthe Bishop of London in a repentant mood.\r\n\r\nThe new Governor General arrived in Virginia in the winter of 1698. He\r\nfound that the personnel of the Council had been greatly changed during\r\nhis absence. But there were several familiar faces in the group which\r\nmet in the great hall of the residence of the late William Sherwood.\r\nNicholson then announced the King's appointments to the Council and\r\nadministered the oath required by Parliament to those who were present.\r\nOne wonders whether Matthew Page and Benjamin Harrison, in their elation\r\nat being elevated to the \"Virginia House of Lords,\" suspected that it\r\nwould involve them in bitter controversy with the Governor, or that\r\nthey, together with four of their fellow Councillors, would be\r\nresponsible for his removal from office.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing basically despotic in the program Nicholson outlined\r\nfor himself. He sought to set the finances of the colony in order by\r\neliminating frauds and demanding a strict payment of quit rents so as to\r\nincrease the royal revenue. He was determined to uphold the King's\r\nprerogative against all assaults by the Council or the Burgesses. He\r\nwished to put the colony in a state of readiness to repel any attack by\r\nhostile Indians, and to aid other colonies who should become involved in\r\nIndian wars. He tried to gain permanent tenure for the clergy so as to\r\ngive them a degree of independence of the vestries. He planned a new\r\ncity which was to be the seat of government, with broad streets and\r\ncharming Capitol and Governor's mansion.\r\n\r\nSince certain features of this program ran counter to the interests of\r\nthe Council, and others to those of the people, to carry them through\r\nwould have required resolution, tact, moderation, and ability to handle\r\nmen. Resolution Nicholson had in abundance, but in other respects he was\r\nentirely unsuited for the task he set himself. To vilify men, to call\r\nthem rascals, to threaten to lash them with his whip was not the way to\r\nhandle the liberty-loving Virginians. His attempts to bribe the\r\nCouncillors and the Burgesses with fat jobs and to pack the courts with\r\nfavorites, might have been more successful had they not been accompanied\r\nwith such violent bursts of temper and such threats of ruin against any\r\nwho opposed him.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the Committee of Trade, finding that the amount of\r\ntobacco received in England was far greater than that on which the\r\nexport duty was paid in Virginia, became convinced that there were great\r\nfrauds in collections. The fault lay with the naval officers and\r\ncollectors, they thought. They instructed Nicholson not to appoint the\r\nsame person to both offices, and not to permit members of the Council to\r\nhold either. When the Governor, not wishing to offend, at first failed\r\nto comply, they gave him a severe rebuke. In June, 1699, he was forced\r\nto turn several Councillors out of their lucrative jobs.\r\n\r\nThis drew from them a violent protest. They denied that they had any\r\nknowledge of frauds in the collections. To forbid Councillors to hold\r\nthese positions was to reverse the custom of many years. The income was\r\ntheir only compensation for their expense in journeying perhaps seventy\r\nmiles, perhaps one hundred miles, in some cases crossing great rivers,\r\nto attend meetings of the Council and the General Court. And though they\r\ncould not directly blame Nicholson, they probably suspected that it was\r\nat his suggestion that the instruction had been made. So it was a soured\r\nand discontented group of men who dispersed to return to their homes\r\nafter the Council meeting ended.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Old Capitol at Williamsburg, showing the north\r\n    elevation which is a duplicate of the historic Virginia Capitol\r\n    originally completed in 1705. Courtesy of Colonial Williamsburg,\r\n    Inc.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The House of Burgesses in the Old Capitol at\r\n    Williamsburg. Courtesy of Colonial Williamsburg, Inc.]\r\n\r\nNicholson's efforts to secure more accurate returns of the quit rents\r\ndid not put them in better humor. It was well known that it was a common\r\npractice for men to \"conceal\" part of their holdings when the sheriff\r\ncame round to collect the rent, and, if the sheriff happened to be a\r\nfriend or a relative, he would not look into the matter too closely. As\r\nfor the great tracts held by the wealthy, the sheriffs dared not demand\r\nthe rent. To do so would certainly be bitterly resented and might cost\r\nthem their jobs. Nicholson was convinced that a strict accounting would\r\ngreatly increase the returns.\r\n\r\nWhen he was Lieutenant Governor he had tried to force the large\r\nlandholders to pay their rents by taking the matter into the courts.\r\nMaking a test case of Colonel Lawrence Smith, who had several large\r\nproperties, he ordered the Attorney General to prosecute him. The case\r\nwas ready for trial when Nicholson was removed and it was afterwards\r\ncompounded for a small sum.[1]\r\n\r\nAt the time Nicholson had had some thoughts of drawing up \"an exact,\r\ntrue, and perfect rent roll.\" But the Council, who had no desire to have\r\ntheir own \"concealed\" acres exposed, pointed out that it would be a\r\ndifficult and costly undertaking. So for the time being the matter was\r\ndropped. But when Nicholson began his second administration he resumed\r\nhis efforts. He instructed William Byrd, the Auditor, to order the\r\nsheriffs to make accurate rolls of holdings in their counties. But as\r\nlate as October, 1703, Byrd reported that though he had urged this on\r\nthe sheriffs he realized that there was \"still very great abuse\r\ntherein.\"[2] Yet the next year the Governor had in his hands a rent\r\nroll, which, however imperfect, must have been of great value in the\r\ncollection of the rents. Undoubtedly much of the unoccupied lands were\r\nnot put down on the rolls, yet some of the members of the Council were\r\nhard hit. Byrd now had to pay on 20,700 acres, Custis on 12,600,\r\nHarrison on 9,100, and the others on holdings ranging from 2,000 to\r\n7,000 acres. Other members of the aristocracy, many of them related to\r\none or more Councillors, were put down for thousands of acres. Lewis\r\nBurwell had 7,000 acres in the Isle of Wight County, 4,800 acres in King\r\nWilliam, 3,300 acres in Gloucester, 2,100 acres in York, and 1,300 in\r\nJames City County.[3]\r\n\r\nHaving alienated the Councillors and other influential men by striking\r\nat their pocketbooks, Nicholson proceeded to cross swords with another\r\ninfluential group--the vestrymen. The Virginia clergymen had long\r\ncomplained of the insecurity of their tenure, for the vestries who\r\nappointed them claimed the right also of dismissing them when they\r\nproved unsatisfactory. \"They are to their vestries in the nature of\r\nhired servants, agreed with from year to year, and dismissed ... without\r\nany crime proved or so much as alleged against them,\" Commissary Blair\r\ncomplained.\r\n\r\nClaiming that whenever a vestry failed to present their minister to him\r\nfor induction, he had the right to fix him on them for life by\r\ncollation, Nicholson appealed to Sir Edward Northey, Attorney General of\r\nEngland. Northey's opinion supported him fully, and in triumph the\r\nGovernor sent copies to all the vestries. But he met with one rebuff\r\nafter another. We \"do not think it proper, neither are we willing to\r\nmake presentation for induction,\" replied one vestry. Another declared\r\nthat the word induction sounded very harsh in their ears, and as for\r\ncollation they hoped the Governor would not try it. And Nicholson,\r\nrealizing that, if he should, the vestry would refuse to pay his\r\nappointee his salary and so starve him out, was forced to let the matter\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\nDespite his efforts for the clergy, the Governor managed to change the\r\nfriendship of the man who was so largely responsible for his appointment\r\ninto bitter hatred. Blair turned against him because he took over many\r\nfunctions rightly belonging to the Commissary and tried to make himself\r\nhead of the Church. \"He has invaded almost all ... parts of the\r\necclesiastical jurisdiction,\" Blair complained, \"such as convoking the\r\nclergy, ... appearing himself in their meetings and proposing the\r\nsubject matter of their consultations, ... requiring of some ministers\r\ncanonical obedience to himself as their bishop, taking upon himself to\r\nturn out ministers.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThis was followed by an attempt to take out of the hands of the\r\nCouncillors the control of the military forces of the colony. In the\r\nsummer of 1701, when England was on the verge of war with France, word\r\nreached Virginia that a French fleet was preparing to sail for the West\r\nIndies. Claiming that there was danger that they might attack Virginia,\r\n\"being an open and defenseless country,\" Nicholson organized a new force\r\nto resist them. He ordered the captains of militia to pick out every\r\nfifth man in their companies, \"being persons young, brisk, fit, and able\r\nto go out to war,\" and organize them into bands of thirty, mounted and\r\nfully equipped.[5]\r\n\r\nThus the militia, who were largely under the command of members of the\r\nCouncil, were to be superseded by a new force under Nicholson himself.\r\nThe people became alarmed when it was rumored that he was trying to\r\npersuade the English government to keep a standing army in America with\r\nhimself as Captain General. If he succeeds, men told each other, we may\r\nas well bid goodbye to liberty, for then he will carry out his threats\r\nof taking and arming all our servants, of bringing the Burgesses with\r\nropes about the necks, and daring the Assembly to \"deny him\r\nanything.\"[6]\r\n\r\nWhen the war with France began and the attack fell, not on Virginia, but\r\non New York, King William asked the Assembly to give financial aid. But\r\nthe Burgesses refused, pointing out that they needed all their resources\r\nto protect their own exposed frontier. It is possible that it was\r\nbecause this answer interfered with his own ambition that it was so\r\ndispleasing to Nicholson. His Majesty should signify his resentment and\r\norder the Burgesses on their allegiance to comply, he thought, \"and I\r\nhope in God that they will then\" do so.[7] Losing his temper, as he\r\nalways did when opposed, he threatened to draft men, even members of the\r\nHouse, on his own authority and send them to fight in New York. Much\r\nmore to his credit was his action in advancing L900 to New York out of\r\nhis own pocket.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Nicholson, when he had cooled off, had no real\r\nintention of carrying out his threats against the Burgesses, but he did\r\ntry to control them by a brazen use of the patronage. Of twenty-two\r\nsheriffs whom he appointed in June, 1699, no less than sixteen were\r\nBurgesses. Ignoring the advice of the Council, he put men in or turned\r\nthem out as they voted as he directed. During one session of the\r\nAssembly, when seven of the Burgesses were county clerks, he had seven\r\nblank commissions made out and placed in the Secretary's office where\r\nall could see them. Then he spread the report that any or all of the\r\nclerks who proved to be \"bad boys\" were to be dismissed and the\r\ncommissions given to those who behaved better.[8]\r\n\r\n\"Are not all the places of profit in the hands of the Governor?\" it was\r\nasked.[9] The sheriff of King and Queen County was arbitrarily removed\r\nwhen he was busy collecting the poll tax. If it happened that one of\r\nNicholson's favorites was legally ineligible for an office he would give\r\nhim a blank commission and tell him to fill it in with the name of a\r\nrelative or friend, or even to sell it. Colonel John West was stated to\r\nhave sold a sheriff's commission for 8,000 pounds of tobacco.[10]\r\n\r\nThe members of the House who were deaf to his threats and promises, the\r\nGovernor tried to wheedle. \"We have a way of treating three days in a\r\nweek all the Assembly time,\" said Harrison, \"where some of the House\r\nconstantly attend to get their bellies full of victuals and too many\r\ntimes their heads full of strong drink.\"[11]\r\n\r\nFearing that even such measures would not avail if a hostile House were\r\nreturned, the Governor interfered actively in the elections. \"We have\r\nhad an election of Burgesses ... in which there hath been ... promises,\r\nthreats, spreading scandalous reports ... browbeating ... and what not,\"\r\nPhilip Ludwell, Junior, wrote his father. Nicholson had been in Charles\r\nCity County to oppose the election of Benjamin Harrison, promising\r\nsheriff's and clerk's places to some and threatening others. \"Having rid\r\nall through Charles City, from house to house, he went to Surry.\" Here\r\nhe commanded the sheriff to draw up a list of those who spoke ill of\r\nMajor Allen, the candidate he favored. When Major Thomas Swan was\r\nelected, he forbade the sheriff \"at his peril\" to return him. And he\r\ntold the sheriff of James City County that he could not serve two\r\nmasters, and if Benjamin Harrison were chosen, he need never expect any\r\nmore favors from him.[12]\r\n\r\nIn his dealing with the House of Burgesses, the Governor sacrificed any\r\ninfluence he had built up, by his disregard of their privileges and his\r\nviolent abuse of individual members and of the body as a whole. His\r\nagent in London, John Thrale, saw no reason why the Burgesses should be\r\nangered at him for proposing a tax bill. If Mr. Thrale knew how they\r\ndisliked those levy bills which arose outside the House, he would change\r\nhis mind, Philip Ludwell pointed out.[13] In one of his fits of temper\r\nNicholson threatened to cut the Speaker's throat.[14]\r\n\r\nIn the General Court Nicholson made free use of threats and promises to\r\nsecure verdicts to his liking. Robert Beverley said it was his constant\r\npractice to browbeat and vilify both lawyers and their clients. Two\r\ncases, especially, he managed with such violence \"that there was not one\r\nperson in court, favorite or foe, but thought it very hard and unjust\r\ndealing.\" One case had to be postponed several times because as soon as\r\nit came up he flew into such a rage that the court had to adjourn.[15]\r\n\r\nNicholson threw one suit out of court without even consulting the other\r\nJudges. In another he pleaded \"from the bench more like a party than a\r\njudge and flew into great heats and passions.\" In the case of Swan\r\n_versus_ Wilson, he grossly abused Swan's attorney. When the verdict\r\nwent for Swan, Wilson's attorney said there had been an error in form.\r\nTo this Harrison replied that the form had been in keeping with Virginia\r\npractice. Instantly Nicholson turned on him, thundering out: \"Sir, you\r\nare the Queen's counsel and pretend to set up a precedent in Virginia\r\ncontrary to the practice in England. You shall not impose upon me with\r\nyour tricks and equivocations.\"[16] On another occasion he became so\r\nenraged against Mr. Bartholomew Fowler, one of the attorneys, \"a very\r\nsickly, weak man,\" that he seized him by the collar and shook him,\r\nswearing that his commands must be obeyed without hesitation or\r\nreserve.[17]\r\n\r\nIf we may believe Robert Beverley, the Governor made a habit of packing\r\nthe grand jury, in order to get flattering addresses from them. He would\r\npick out men whom he knew he could influence, send for them to come to\r\nWilliamsburg, and order the sheriff to put them on the jury in place of\r\nothers of whom he was doubtful. Beverley was talking with a man whom the\r\nsheriff had summoned and then had discharged, when the sheriff happened\r\nto pass. So the man stopped him to ask why he had done it. He replied\r\nthat the Governor had ordered him to do it. When the jury he had\r\nselected for the purpose gave him the address he wanted, he showered\r\nthem with favors. To the foreman he gave a naval officer's place, others\r\nhe \"favored by barefaced methods\" in cases at law in which they were\r\nconcerned, still others had sheriff's places.[18]\r\n\r\nNicholson's greatest blunder was to antagonize the Council. Its members,\r\nrepresenting the Virginia aristocracy, and having influential friends at\r\nCourt, were not the men to sit quietly and see their hard-earned\r\nprivileges taken from them. Is the Council so mean spirited as to let a\r\nGovernor do all the ill things he pleases in their names, and all the\r\nwhile using them like slaves, not suffering them to have any opinion of\r\ntheir own? Philip Ludwell asked. \"Arbitrary power is grown to a high\r\npitch among us. Hectoring is the only court language. Our laws and\r\nliberties openly trampled upon.\"[19]\r\n\r\nNicholson should have known that he was in for a fight to the finish\r\nwhen he bearded the Councillors. Prominent among them was the pugnacious\r\nCommissary James Blair. Robert Carter, of Corotoman, had been a Burgess\r\nat twenty-eight, and had twice been Speaker. A man of great energy,\r\nshrewd, and dominating he was dubbed \"King Carter.\" Benjamin Harrison\r\nhad represented Surry in the House of Burgesses, was a Visitor of the\r\nCollege of William and Mary, was commander of the Surry militia. Philip\r\nLudwell, Jr., Page, Custis, Bassett, Duke, and the others were all men\r\nof wealth and influence.\r\n\r\nThe first open breach between these men and Nicholson came when he began\r\nto make appointments to office without consulting them. They were\r\noutraged when he removed their friends from lucrative jobs to make room\r\nfor his own favorites. They protested the issuing of warrants on the\r\nrevenue and the giving of patents to land without their consent. It was\r\nalmost an insult for him to prorogue the Assembly on his own authority\r\nand without their knowledge.\r\n\r\nLater Nicholson put the blame on the Councillors themselves for his\r\nfailure to get along with them. They hated him, he said, because he\r\nwould not be guided and governed by them, and turn secretaries,\r\nauditors, collectors, naval officers, and others out of their places and\r\nput them and their friends in, and would not let them do what they\r\npleased.[20]\r\n\r\nThe Council meetings became stormy, with the Councillors protesting to\r\nthe Governor and the Governor flying into a rage. When the sessions\r\nwere held in the Wren Building at the college prior to the completing of\r\nthe new Capitol, passersby could hear Nicholson storming \"as loud as he\r\ncould extend his voice.\" If any member dared to oppose him in any\r\nmeasure he was sure to bring down on himself a volley of insults.\r\n\r\nThe Councillors were liable to abuse even when the Council was not in\r\nsession. One day when John Lightfoot was in Williamsburg, he called on\r\nthe Governor. He had not been in his presence fifteen minutes before\r\nNicholson began to storm at him, calling him a rogue, a rascal, and a\r\nvillain. \"You have sided with that damned Scotch parson, Blair, and by\r\nGod, sir, you have shipped yourself in a leaky vessel.... You shall be\r\nturned out of the Council.\" Then he flew out against the rest of the\r\nCouncil, saying there was not one of them who was not a rogue and a\r\ncoward, who did not dare look a man in the face.[21]\r\n\r\nThe testimony regarding Nicholson's violent temper is so overwhelming as\r\nto indicate that the man was unbalanced. On one occasion while talking\r\nwith Captain James Moodie in an \"upper apartment\" of the college, he\r\nflew into a violent passion against the Commissioners of the Navy,\r\n\"calling them all the basest names the tongue of man could express.\"\r\nThese imprecations were thundered out \"with such a noise that the people\r\ndown in the lower rooms came running up stairs ... believing that the\r\ncollege had been on fire.\" Several sea captains, who were lodging in a\r\nroom some distance away, \"came running out of their beds in their\r\nshirts,\" one of them \"without his wooden leg, holding himself by the\r\nwall.\"[22]\r\n\r\nIf Nicholson had contented himself with hurling imprecations at those\r\nwho offended him, his victims might have been able to endure it. \"I must\r\nconfess I have no reason to be satisfied with the insolent, tyrannical\r\nbehavior of our Governor, but as long as he is vested with the Queen's\r\nauthority, I will quietly endure his barbarous usage,\" wrote Philip\r\nLudwell.[23] But when Nicholson carried his malice so far as to\r\nprosecute those to whom he took a disliking, deprive them of their jobs,\r\nand imprison them, their safety lay in fleeing the colony.\r\n\r\nClergymen seem to have been especially unfortunate in incurring\r\nNicholson's resentment. At a convocation of the clergy in Elizabeth City\r\nchurch, on October 28, 1702, Commissary Blair asked the Reverend James\r\nWallace, the minister, to deliver a sermon. The Governor, who claimed\r\nto be the head of the Virginia Church and had summoned the meeting in\r\norder to secure a flattering address, was present. It may have been this\r\nwhich influenced Mr. Wallace to choose as his text: \"Herein do I\r\nexercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God\r\nand toward men,\" and to use it to illustrate the duty of both government\r\nofficials and clergymen.\r\n\r\nShortly after the services were over Nicholson sent for Mr. Wallace.\r\n\"How durst you preach such a sermon?\" he demanded. \"How dare you take\r\nsuch a text? How dare you presume to tell me my duty? I will not be told\r\nmy duty.\" From that day the Governor pursued him with the greatest\r\nmalice. He summoned him before the Council, and threatened him with\r\nruin, calling him villain, hypocrite, Jesuit. He went all the way to\r\nElizabeth City to lay charges against him before his vestry. When Mr.\r\nWallace could endure this persecution no longer and prepared to sail for\r\nEngland, he tried to stop him.[24]\r\n\r\nIf anything else were needed to make Nicholson a ridiculous figure, it\r\nwas his love affair with Lucy Burwell. Lucy's father, Major Lewis\r\nBurwell, was perhaps the wealthiest man in Virginia. Owning many\r\nthousands of acres of land, served by scores of slaves and indentured\r\nworkers, connected by marriage and birth with some of the most\r\ninfluential families in the colony, he was the typical Virginia\r\naristocrat. Carter's Creek, his residence in Gloucester County, remained\r\nstanding for over two centuries as witness to his lavish style of\r\nliving. The great halls, the marble mantels, the elaborate staircase,\r\nthe wainscoting carved to resemble drapery were reminiscent rather of\r\nEngland than of seventeenth-century Virginia. However, Lucy seems to\r\nhave spent most of her childhood, not at Carter's Creek, but at King's\r\nCreek, an historic old estate left to her parents by her mother's uncle,\r\nNathaniel Bacon, Senior. And here it was that Nicholson pressed his\r\nsuit, riding over to see her whenever there was a lull in the business\r\nof the General Court and the Assembly was not in session.\r\n\r\nLucy and her family received him with the courtesy due the\r\nrepresentative of the Crown. But they knew of the Governor's fits of\r\nanger, of his profanity, and the abuse he had heaped on their relatives.\r\nLucy was not attracted to him and, telling him she did not love him,\r\nrefused to marry him.\r\n\r\nWhen he was at last convinced that all hope of winning Lucy was gone,\r\nNicholson acted like a madman. He swore that if she married another he\r\nwould with his own hands cut the throats of the bridegroom, the\r\nminister, and the justice of the peace who issued the license.[25] All\r\npretence of friendship for her relatives was thrown to the winds. Every\r\nfew days he sent Major Burwell such threats of ruin that the poor man\r\nwas kept in a constant state of alarm. \"For what I know not, unless it\r\nis because I will not force my daughter to marry utterly against her\r\nwill, which is a thing no Christian body can do,\" he wrote Philip\r\nLudwell, Senior. \"If it please God I live until the return of our next\r\nfleet, I propose for England, for I shall not be able to live here.\"[26]\r\n\r\nNicholson became violently jealous of young Stephen Fouace, minister of\r\nMartin's Hundred parish, in which the Burwells resided. One night, when\r\nhe was returning from a pastoral call at King's Creek he happened to\r\nmeet the Governor. Falling into one of his rages, Nicholson, in a\r\nthundering voice, commanded him never again to visit the house unless\r\nsent for, and never again to speak to Lucy.[27]\r\n\r\n\"Why, Sir,\" stammered the frightened pastor, \"what is the matter? Does\r\nyour Excellency take me for your rival? I assure you, sir, I have not\r\nthat foolish presumption to think to be preferred to your Excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your prate, sirrah. I have taken good notice of you. You are an\r\nimpudent rogue, a villain, a rascal.\"\r\n\r\nAs they were riding along together Nicholson reached over and pulled\r\nFouace's hat from his head.\r\n\r\n\"How do you have the impudence to ride with me with your hat on?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will not use me like a footman,\" said Fouace.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause Nicholson asked: \"Is it not a shame for one of your\r\nfunction to suffer me to be ridiculed and railed at in some companies\r\nwhere I know you have been? Is it not your duty to reprove them?\"\r\n\r\nFouace replied that the best way to avoid ridicule was to be sure that\r\nhis behavior was such as not to expose him to odium and contempt, that\r\neven the King of France could not hinder many of his subjects from\r\nspeaking ill of him.\r\n\r\n\"But seeing your Excellency is pleased to make me mindful of my duty to\r\nreprove the evil I see done in my presence, I must make bold to reprove\r\nyour Excellency for using at this rate in the highway, in the woods, and\r\nin the night, on a Sunday, a clergyman coming from visiting the sick of\r\nhis parish.\"\r\n\r\nNicholson received this in silence. But a few minutes later he ran at\r\nFouace, trying to seize him, and threatening to lash him with his whip.\r\nThis frightened him, for the Governor had his sword and pistols with\r\nhim, and they were alone in the night. So he wheeled, set spurs to his\r\nhorse, and fled.[28]\r\n\r\nBut he could not escape Nicholson's malice. He soon found that life in\r\nVirginia was intolerable, and laid his plans to leave for England. But\r\nthe Governor had no desire to have him lay charges against him before\r\nthe Bishop of London and the Lords of Trade and Plantations. After he\r\nhad gone aboard the tobacco fleet, he tried to bring him back, but by\r\nshifting from ship to ship Fouace managed to escape.\r\n\r\nNicholson's folly aroused astonishment even in England, and the gossips\r\nin the London Exchange and the coffee houses tittered at his\r\nunsuccessful suit. An English clergyman wrote him an anonymous letter.\r\n\"It is not here as in some barbarous countries where the tender lady is\r\noften dragged into the Sultan's arms just reeking in the blood of her\r\nnearest relations, and yet must strongly dissemble her aversion. But\r\nEnglish women are the freest in the world, and will not be won by\r\nconstraint, but hate them who use them and theirs roughly.\"\r\n\r\nOne day when Nicholson was calling on Lucy, before the final breach had\r\noccurred, she happened to drop her handkerchief. He picked it up,\r\nslipped several rings in it unobserved by Lucy, and handing it to her\r\nmounted his horse and rode away. She sent them back to him, but he\r\nreturned them. And for a while she kept them. Later he complained of the\r\ncostliness of his suit. \"Though she would not accept him,\" he told\r\nseveral persons, \"she and her friends had taken presents to the value of\r\nL500.\"[29]\r\n\r\nWhen this came to Lucy's ears, she thought it necessary to return\r\neverything he had given her. So she, with her mother and brother,\r\ntogether with her uncle, Philip Ludwell, Junior, went to Williamsburg\r\nwith them. But Nicholson, hearing of their mission, \"slipt out in the\r\nmorning.\" The little group retired to the nearby Wren building, and\r\nwaited there until six o'clock in the evening. Then they went back to\r\nNicholson's house, where Ludwell went in to the \"public room\" and left\r\nthe gifts on the table.\r\n\r\nLate that night, after he had retired, Ludwell was aroused by two\r\nmessengers sent by the Governor, one bringing the gifts, and the other a\r\nsummons in the Queen's name for him to come to Nicholson immediately.\r\nLudwell told the man that he \"could not apprehend the Queen had any\r\noccasion for his services\" just at that moment, and so went back to bed.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning he went to the Governor's house, taking the gifts\r\nwith him. He found Nicholson in a towering rage.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how you dare come into my house yesterday when I was abroad to\r\noffer me such an insult?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I never offered your Excellency an affront in my life that I know\r\nof,\" Ludwell replied.\r\n\r\n\"Yes you have, several, like the base villain and rascal that you are.\"\r\n\r\nLudwell bowed and thanked him for this \"civil usage.\" But Nicholson\r\nbegan again to storm, calling him \"rogue, lying villain, base rascal,\r\nand coward,\" and declaring that he would teach him his duty. Finally he\r\ntold him to get out of his house and not return until he was sent for.\r\nThis Ludwell did with alacrity. But he took good care to leave the\r\ngifts. At first this escaped Nicholson's notice, but while Ludwell was\r\nputting on his boots he rushed up to him, \"calling him all the names the\r\nDevil could invent\" and commanding him to take the things.[30]\r\n\r\nWhen Ludwell had mounted his horse and started to ride away, the\r\nGovernor ran out \"stark mad,\" and catching hold of his coat tried to\r\npull him from his horse. Failing in this, he snatched his whip from his\r\nhand, and ordered him in the Queen's name to dismount. When he had done\r\nso, he shook the whip over his head, and swore that he had a mind to\r\nslash him soundly. Ludwell told him that as he was Governor of Virginia\r\nhe had to take all his ill usage, but if he were in another place he\r\nwould not dare treat him so. A few days later Nicholson challenged\r\nLudwell to a duel. But Ludwell declined. He had not so much love for the\r\ngallows, he said. \"But I always wear a sword with which to defend\r\nmyself, and I am always easily found.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one reads the long recital of Nicholson's misdeeds, one is apt to\r\nforget that he conferred one lasting benefit on the colony, a benefit\r\nwhich today is shared by millions of Americans from all parts of the\r\ncountry. He was the founder of Williamsburg. It was on October 21, 1698,\r\nthat a fire broke out in the statehouse at Jamestown which in a few\r\nhours laid the building in ashes. So the old question of moving the\r\ncapital away from the mosquito-infested town on the banks of the James\r\nwas again debated. Nicholson favored Middle Plantation. The college was\r\nlocated there, there was ample room for a town, there were several\r\nsprings of pure water, and the place was healthful. The Assembly voted\r\nthat a city be laid out there, which, in honor of the \"most gracious and\r\nglorious King William,\" was to be named Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nNicholson busied himself with planning the streets, which at first he\r\nhoped to lay out in the form of the letters W and M in honor of King\r\nWilliam and Queen Mary. When this proved too complicated, he decided to\r\nrun a central avenue from the college to the site of the Capitol, to be\r\nnamed Duke of Gloucester Street, paralleled by two side streets, one of\r\nwhich was to be called Nicholson and the other Francis. To aid him in\r\ndesigning the Capitol, he called in the ablest architect and builder in\r\nthe colony, Henry Cary, and day after day the pair pored over the\r\ndrawings. What book of designs they had before them from which to\r\ndraw their inspiration we do not know, but it must have been of\r\nrecent publication, for the building was typical of the late\r\nseventeenth-century English houses.\r\n\r\nThe plan called for a brick structure of two wings, connected by a\r\ngallery, the whole to be two stories high, with a sharply rising roof\r\npierced with dormers and surmounted by a high cupola. The floors of the\r\nfirst story were to be laid in flagstones, while the roof was to be\r\ncovered with cyprus shingles. Inside were to be rooms for the Council,\r\nthe General Court, the House of Burgesses, and several committee rooms.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude of the Virginians to Nicholson for founding their new\r\ncapital and adorning it with beautiful buildings did not blind them to\r\nhis violence, his injustice, and his persecution of innocent men. Does\r\nhe think he is governing the Moors or some other slavish people? they\r\nasked. He seems to think it a crime in us to demand the liberties of\r\nEnglishmen. \"That which bears up their spirits under all the heavy\r\ncustoms on their commodities, and restraints in point of trade, is that\r\nthey have the happiness to enjoy the British laws and constitution,\r\nwhich they reckon the best of Governments,\" said Philip Ludwell, Senior.\r\n\"But if once their Governors be suffered to break in upon them in this\r\ntender point, and to treat them with the arbitrariness of France, or the\r\ninsolence of Morocco, as this gentleman has done, it is not to be\r\nimagined how ill this will go down with Englishmen that have not forgot\r\nthe liberty of their mother country. The least that can be expected from\r\nit is that men of substance, if they find no redress, will remove\r\nthemselves and their effects out of the colony to any other part of the\r\nworld where they may enjoy peace and quietness.\"[31]\r\n\r\nAt last six members of the Council--Lightfoot, Page, Harrison, Carter,\r\nBlair, and Ludwell--drew up charges against Nicholson. Though they were\r\ncareful to keep the matter secret the Governor suspected that something\r\nwas up. In July, 1703, he wrote the Lords of Trade: \"It hath been\r\nindustriously reported here that ... I was turned out of the government\r\nfor maladministration.... I hope in God, I shall not only be able to\r\nclear myself, but to make my accusers appear ill people.\"[32]\r\n\r\nNicholson might have surmised that it was Blair who would present\r\ncharges against him when, several weeks later, the Commissary left for\r\nEngland. But he could not have anticipated the strategem which the\r\nshrewd Scot was to adopt. Though he arrived in November, 1703, he did\r\nnot present the charges of the six Councillors to the Queen in the\r\nCouncil until late in the following March, after the tobacco fleet had\r\nsailed for Virginia. Thus months would elapse before Nicholson could\r\nhave word of them and prepare his answers.\r\n\r\nThe Privy Council referred the charges to the Lords of Trade and\r\nPlantations. It must have been with surprise that they listened as the\r\npetition was read. We appeal to \"your Majesty for relief of ourselves\r\nand other subjects of Virginia from many great grievances and pressures\r\nwe lie under by reason of the unusual, insolent, and arbitrary methods\r\nof government, as well as wicked and scandalous examples of life, which\r\nhave been now for divers years past put in practice by Nicholson, which\r\nwe have hitherto in vain endeavored by more soft and gentle applications\r\nto himself to remedy and prevent. But to our unspeakable grief we have\r\nreaped no other fruit ... but that thereby we have so highly exasperated\r\nthe revengeful mind of Nicholson to the height of implacable malice and\r\nenmity against ourselves and the better part of the people ... that\r\nwithout your Majesty's seasonable interposition we fear the dangerous\r\nconsequences, not only in fomenting lasting feuds and acrimonies among\r\nthe people here, but in endangering the public peace of Virginia.\"[33]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer Blair had not been idle. It is probable that the\r\nlittle colony of Virginians in London got together to plan their\r\nstrategy. When the matter came before the Lords of Trade, the Commissary\r\nwas armed with affidavits from Fouace, Captain James Moodie, and others,\r\nand letters from Philip Ludwell, Junior, and Benjamin Harrison to the\r\nelder Ludwell, accusing Nicholson of tyranny. At the hearing Wallace,\r\nGeorge Luke, and Robert Beverley were called on to tell their stories of\r\npersecution and injustice.\r\n\r\nHearing that John Thrale was agent for Nicholson, the Lords called him\r\nin. He made the best defense he could, but he was ignorant of the whole\r\nmatter, and he had not witnesses to refute the charges. When he demanded\r\nparticular instances of misgovernment and injustice, Blair and Beverley\r\noverwhelmed him with them.[34] To make the Governor's case hopeless,\r\nThrale died in the midst of the hearings, leaving him without anyone to\r\ndefend him.[35]\r\n\r\nLate in October, 1704, when the first word of the petition reached\r\nNicholson he was heard \"to make a terrible imprecation, vowing to the\r\nliving God that he would pursue the petitioners with eternal vengeance.\"\r\nAt a meeting of the Council he glared at the members. \"Whoever they were\r\nthat signed that petition I hope they will be obliged to stand by it in\r\nEngland and that such of them as are there will be obliged to stay and\r\nthose here to go thither, where it is my desire to come to a fair\r\nhearing,\" he told them.[36]\r\n\r\nHe defended himself in several long letters to the Board. He had done no\r\nmore than defend the Queen's prerogative against the assaults of the\r\nCouncil, he said. If everything they asked were granted them, \"her\r\nMajesty would have but a skeleton of a government left, and hardly the\r\npower of a Doge of Genoa. And I think the question may be put to them\r\nas the wise King Solomon did to his mother, why don't they ask the\r\nkingdom or the government also?\" As for Commissary Blair, he \"and his\r\nlittle faction now set up to have the power and interest of turning out\r\nand putting in Governors, and affect the title that the great Earl of\r\nWarwick had.\" If he were ousted, he would present himself to the Board,\r\n\"when I hope I shall not be found to have a cloven foot, to be a fury,\r\nor to have snakes instead of hair.\"[37]\r\n\r\nIf we may credit the reports from Virginia which reached Blair, Ludwell,\r\nand Fouace in England in January, 1705, Nicholson began proceedings to\r\n\"terrify all people\" from discussing his conduct. \"He sets up\r\ninquisition courts, giving commissions to some of his creatures to\r\nexamine all persons on oath if ever they heard such a man reflect upon\r\nthe Governor ... which practice is very terrible to all, there being few\r\nin Virginia who have not sometimes in private spoke of him as he\r\ndeserves ... If witnesses are backward they are threatened by the\r\nGovernor himself and terrified into depositions.\" When anyone was\r\naccused of complaining of him, even in private, he ordered the Attorney\r\nGeneral to prosecute him under the law against defaming the Governor\r\npassed after Bacon's Rebellion.[38]\r\n\r\nThe Governor had one warm defender in Colonel Robert Quary. In a letter\r\nto the Board of Trade he testified that, when Nicholson was appointed,\r\nthe Councillors expected to \"govern and direct all matters,\" to\r\nmonopolize all places of profit and honor, and have him \"suppress all\r\nthat were not of their faction.\" But when they found that he would not\r\nbe governed by them, they turned upon him with the greatest malice.\r\n\"They aspersed and blackened him both in the country and by letters to\r\nEngland, as if he had been the greatest monster in nature.\" He had been\r\nguilty of no maladministration in his government \"further than some\r\nescapes of his passion, which their injustice often forced him to.\"[39]\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of March, 1705, Nicholson was busy preparing his\r\ndefence so that it could get off on the first vessel sailing for\r\nEngland. He penned long letters to the Lords of Trade on the first, the\r\nthird, and the sixth, and enclosed them with a memorial against Blair,\r\nand an address from the Virginia clergy. These papers were received on\r\nMay 2, and read May 31. Whether they would have influenced the Lords in\r\nNicholson's favor we do not know, for on April 2, just a month before\r\ntheir arrival, the Board received a communication from Secretary Hedges,\r\nadvising them that the Queen wished them to prepare a commission and\r\ninstructions for Colonel Edward Nott to be Governor General of\r\nVirginia.[40]\r\n\r\nIt was on August 15, 1705, that the Council met in their beautiful room\r\nin the new Capitol, for Nott's inauguration. When all had been seated\r\nNicholson entered and read a letter from the Queen directing him to\r\ndeliver up the government and \"repair to her royal presence.\" He must\r\nhave looked around at the men who had been his bitter enemies with an\r\nair of triumph as he read a letter from Secretary Hedges, stating that\r\nhe was being recalled, not because of the charges made against him, but\r\nmerely for her Majesty's service. Then he handed over the seal of the\r\ncolony and the charter of 1676. One wonders whether, as he bowed himself\r\nout, he took one last look at the room for which he had been so largely\r\nresponsible--the portrait of Queen Anne, the large oval table, the\r\nstiff-backed chairs, the Queen's arms, the panelling.\r\n\r\nNicholson's administration proved once more that the Virginians could\r\nnot be governed by illegal and arbitrary means. That he was not ousted\r\nby violence as was Sir John Harvey, or that he did not drive the people\r\ninto open rebellion as did Berkeley, is explained by the difference in\r\nthe character of the times. Harvey acted in the spirit of the First\r\nStuart Despotism, Berkeley of the Second Stuart Despotism; Nicholson was\r\nout of step with his time. To remove him it was not necessary to resort\r\nto violence; an appeal to the Queen was all that was needed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was fortunate for the cause of self-government that an\r\nexperiment in despotism had failed in the opening years of the\r\neighteenth century. It made succeeding Governors wary of trampling upon\r\nthe people's rights, it gave the people confidence. Having won this\r\nvictory, they went on to others until their Governors became their\r\nservants rather than their masters.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] CO5-1309, Doc. 9.\r\n\r\n[2] CO5-1339, Doc. 33 V.\r\n\r\n[3] T.

They were rid of him, and that was what really mattered. No more\r\ncould he bully them in the Council meetings, no more could he thwart\r\nthem in the General Court by packing juries, no more could he ignore\r\nthem in appointing officers, no more could he insult and revile them. As\r\nthey sat around the table with the mild-mannered Nott, they realized\r\nwith satisfaction that his personality was in strong contrast with that\r\nof his predecessor. Perhaps it would be easy to control him and keep the\r\npower in their own hands.\r\n\r\nTo a large extent this is just what they did. Though Nott was no\r\nweakling, he was anxious to live in peace with both Council and\r\nAssembly. It was said of him that his \"whole study was to do everybody\r\njustice.\"[1] Like other Governors when they first arrived and were\r\nunacquainted with men and conditions in the colony, he was dependent\r\nupon the Councillors for advice and guidance. Before he could learn the\r\nropes, he died. Since four years elapsed before a new Governor arrived\r\nto take his place, the Council remained for half a decade the\r\ncontrolling power in the colony. From August, 1705, to July, 1710, the\r\ngovernment was neither despotic nor democratic, but aristocratic.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Bacon, Nicholson, Spotswood, and others derided the \"mighty\r\ndons\" of the Council, pointing out that they came from humble families\r\nin England. These critics did not stop to consider that it was more to\r\ntheir credit to have won by their own efforts positions of wealth and\r\npower than to have inherited them. Virginia itself offered them the\r\nopportunity, but it was they who seized it.\r\n\r\nThe group of well-to-do planters whom the Council represented, in the\r\nearly years of the eighteenth century were far from numerous. \"In every\r\nriver there are from ten to thirty men who by trade and industry have\r\ngotten very competent estates,\" wrote Colonel Quary. \"Out of this number\r\nare chosen her Majesty's Council, the Assembly, the justices, and\r\nofficers of the government.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIt must have been a humiliation to such proud men as William Byrd II,\r\n\"King\" Carter, and Benjamin Harrison that they were not admitted to the\r\nEnglish peerage. But though there were no dukes, nor lords, nor knights\r\namong the Councillors, they had the right to certain titles which\r\ncarried great distinction. The term \"esquire\" was given to members of\r\nthe Council, and was invariably used by them in signing legal documents.\r\nIf a man were not a Councillor, yet was prominent and wealthy, he had\r\nthe right to sign himself \"gentleman.\" The holders of high office in the\r\nmilitia--colonels, lieutenant colonels, majors, and captains--prized\r\ntheir titles highly and used them in conjunction with \"esquire,\" or\r\n\"gentleman.\"[3]\r\n\r\nNor did the English nobility command greater respect than did the\r\nmembers of the Council in Virginia. When a certain Humphrey\r\nChamberlaine, of Henrico County, became angry with William Byrd I, and,\r\nstripping off his coat, drew his sword as if to attack him, he was\r\narrested and clapped into jail. At his trial he excused himself by\r\nsaying he was a stranger in the country and ignorant of its laws and\r\ncustoms. But the court, ruling that no one \"could be insensible of the\r\nrespect and reverence due so honorable a person as Colonel Byrd,\" fined\r\nhim five pounds sterling.[4]\r\n\r\nAlthough the basis of the wealth of the aristocracy was land, the\r\nholding of large tracts did not in itself bring riches unless the owner\r\ncould find the labor necessary to work them. During most of the\r\nseventeenth century indentured workers were used extensively. But their\r\ncost and the fact that they served but four or five years limited the\r\nreturn they brought their masters. With the importing of slaves in large\r\nnumbers in the last two decades of the seventeenth century and the first\r\nthird of the eighteenth century, the cost of raising tobacco was greatly\r\nlowered. This not only doubled or tripled existing fortunes, but created\r\nmany new ones. It is this which explains why the Virginia aristocracy,\r\nwhich so late as the last decade of the seventeenth century was little\r\nmore than a group, by the mid-eighteenth century had become a numerous\r\nclass.[5]\r\n\r\nIn their mode of life the aristocracy consciously imitated the English\r\ncountry squires. The large libraries which they accumulated served\r\npractical as well as cultural ends. The wealthy man who wished to build\r\na residence pored over James Gibbs' _A Book of Architecture_, or Abraham\r\nSwan's _The British Architect_. In laying out his garden he consulted\r\nKip's _English Houses and Gardens_, or John James' _The Theory and\r\nPractice of Gardening_. On his shelves were English books on law,\r\nmedicine, religion, agriculture.\r\n\r\nFortunately some of the mansions of colonial Virginia have survived the\r\nravages of time, fires, and wars, to bear witness to the charm and\r\ndignity of the plantation life of two centuries ago. Carter's Grove,\r\nMount Airy, Gunston Hall, Westover, Brandon, and others constitute\r\nhistory in brick and wood. The lovely gardens, some of which have been\r\nrestored in recent years, are in the formal style of Le Notre and Rose.\r\nThe mansions were furnished with tables, chairs, bookcases by the\r\nEnglish masters; on the tables were pitchers, goblets, and candlesticks\r\nby English silversmiths. The aristocrat dressed himself and his family\r\nin the latest English fashions, owned an English-made coach, imported\r\nEnglish race horses, perhaps sent his son to Oxford, when he visited\r\nEngland had his portrait painted by Lely or Kneller.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that in so small a group as the early Virginia\r\naristocracy there should be frequent intermarriages. In 1717 half of the\r\nmembers of the Council were related to each other by blood or marriage.\r\nJames Blair and Philip Ludwell were brothers-in-law of Nathaniel\r\nHarrison; William Byrd's wife was the niece of Ludwell; William Bassett\r\nand Edmund Berkeley had married half-nieces of Ludwell; Ludwell's wife\r\nwas Harrison's sister. Governor Spotswood habitually referred to them as\r\n\"the family.\"\r\n\r\nIt was wrong, Spotswood pointed out, that a group of relatives should\r\nwield such power. Since they all sat on the General Court, it was to be\r\nexpected that they would vote as a unit if the interests of any one of\r\nthem were involved. \"Whoever has lived here and frequented the General\r\nCourts held of late in Virginia, has abundant reason to know that there\r\nis a strong link of relatives on the bench, who by their majority have\r\nthe determination of all causes,\" he wrote in 1718. \"When one of their\r\nkindred is charged with enormous crimes, clerks may safely keep back the\r\nexamination, and sheriffs keep back the witnesses.... When the King has\r\nbeen plaintiff in a civil action against one of that family, the cause\r\ncould not be tried for want of judges to make up a bench exclusive of\r\nthose who were akin to the defendant.\"[6]\r\n\r\nOne wonders how long Governor Nott would have put up with this kind of\r\nthing had not death overtaken him. Despite his desire to work in harmony\r\nwith the Council, there is evidence that he had no intention of letting\r\nthem ride over him roughshod. This became evident when they tried to\r\ntake the patronage out of his hands. \"I do believe the Council have a\r\nmind to dispute with me the making of the collectors of the two\r\nshillings per hogshead,\" he wrote the Lords of Trade. \"Their pretence is\r\nthat it is said in my instructions I shall not make them but by advice\r\nof Council. Now they have a mind to turn several out and put in their\r\nown relatives. And that is not my turn of temper.\"[7]\r\n\r\nWhen he asked the advice of the Council before reappointing naval\r\nofficers, they objected to Major Arthur Allen, Colonel Miles Gary, and\r\nColonel William Wilson. But when nothing of consequence was brought\r\nagainst them, the Governor insisted on continuing them. At the same time\r\nhe shook off responsibility by refusing to renew their commissions until\r\nhe had instructions to do so from the Lord Treasurer.[8]\r\n\r\nWhatever resentment the Councillors bore him for this was forgotten when\r\nhe championed their plea that they should not be forbidden to become\r\nnaval officers. \"I think this instruction very strange,\" he wrote the\r\nLords of Trade. \"To be deprived of those few places of profit ... brings\r\nthe consequence that the good men are very indifferent to being one of\r\nthe Council. I hope you are of opinion that this restriction may be\r\ntaken off.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe Governor thought it his duty to defer to the Council in most of his\r\nappointments to lesser offices. \"I have directed new commissioners of\r\npeace,\" he wrote the Lords of Trade, \"and not knowing persons yet, I\r\nleft the nomination of justices solely to the Council. I have continued\r\nthe former escheators since there was no objection to them.\"[10]\r\n\r\nWhen Nott first took over the government, he found the colony divided\r\nagainst itself. The people as a whole were overjoyed to get rid of\r\nNicholson, but a group made up no doubt of men who had received favors\r\nat his hands, resented his removal. When an election was held for a new\r\nAssembly, opposing candidates were put up by the pro-Nicholson and\r\nanti-Nicholson factions. Although the latter won an overwhelming\r\nvictory, enough Nicholson men were returned to continue the old feuds\r\nand hatreds. Governor Nott made his opening address an appeal for peace.\r\nIt was his earnest hope, he said, that all animosities be laid aside,\r\nand that the only contention be as to who should be most obedient to the\r\nQueen and most serviceable to the country.[11]\r\n\r\nDespite this plea the pro-Nicholson faction presented under the guise of\r\na grievance a resolution which was in reality a reproof of the six\r\nmembers of the Council who had presented the charges against the\r\nGovernor. No one should take upon himself to represent to the Queen the\r\ngrievances of the colony without the consent of the House of Burgesses,\r\nit said. No thanks, but rather a check should be given to those that had\r\ndone so against the late Governor. But they met with a severe rebuff. So\r\nfar from approving, the House ordered the so-called grievance to \"be\r\nburnt under the gallows by the sheriff of York County as a mutinous,\r\nseditious, and scandalous paper.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThough there is no evidence that Nott tried to render the Burgesses\r\nsubmissive to his will by bribing them with offices, the Assembly\r\nthought this a golden opportunity to weaken the Governor's appointive\r\npower. Some could recall Berkeley's Long Assembly, and all had been\r\nwitnesses of the shameless way in which Nicholson had handed out jobs.\r\nSo they passed a bill requiring each county court to nominate three men,\r\nall of them justices, from whom the Governor was to select one as\r\nsheriff, who was to serve not more than two years. Had not Nott been so\r\nanxious to avoid any conflict with the Assembly, he would certainly have\r\nvetoed this bill, for not only did it restrict his power of appointment,\r\nbut it infringed upon the royal prerogative.\r\n\r\nBut he balked when the House sent up a bill to require the Governor, in\r\nappointing the justices of the peace, to secure the assent of the\r\nCouncil, or at least five of them. He thought they were going too far in\r\nthis attempt to deprive the Governor of the patronage, leave him at the\r\nmercy of the Council and Assembly, and make him a mere figurehead. When\r\nthe Lords of Trade heard that he had vetoed this bill, they wrote\r\ncongratulating him. \"The restraining Governors from making justices ...\r\nis entrenching on prerogative, and you may be assured it will not be\r\napproved here. In all other plantations the power of appointing and\r\nremoving justices of the peace is solely in the Governor.... But it\r\nwould be prudence in the Governor to advise for his better\r\ninformation.\"[13]\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly met again, in April, 1706, they made a daring attempt\r\nto weaken the Governor's power by passing a substitute law for the\r\nfamous Act of 1680 which gave a perpetual revenue to the Crown. The new\r\nbill bore the disarming title of \"An Act for raising a public revenue\r\nfor the better support of the government ... and for ascertaining the\r\nsalary of the Council.\" Nott apparently saw nothing alarming in it, but\r\nColonel Quary at once suspected that it was intended to weaken the Act\r\nof 1680, and perhaps set a precedent which would eventually give the\r\nHouse control of the revenue from the export duty on tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"These topping men\" were merely waiting an opportunity to have the old\r\nlaw damned, he wrote the Lords of Trade. \"Had the Assembly only designed\r\nto have augmented and added to the Queen's revenue, why could they not\r\nmake an act of it without damning and destroying the former act? And\r\nthat your Lordships may see the snake in the grass, please observe that\r\nthe Assembly are pleased to appropriate the Queen's revenue as they\r\nthink fit, a thing never pretended to before, and to limit and confine\r\nher Majesty from disposing of her own money.... Whereas in a former act\r\nthe Queen was graciously pleased to appropriate L370 to be divided among\r\nthe Council for attendance, in this act they have ordered otherwise ...\r\nby which they have tied up the Queen's hands from giving any part of her\r\nbounty but according to their pleasure.\"[14]\r\n\r\nWhen this bill came before the Board of Trade they referred it to\r\nAttorney General Harcourt and Solicitor General Montague. Although these\r\nastute men, as we have seen, gave it as their opinion that the old act\r\nhad been passed in a way \"contrary to the present method,\" and should be\r\nsuperseded by a new one, the Board decided to let sleeping dogs lie. So\r\nthey advised the Queen to veto the Act of 1716. \"'Tis hoped it will\r\nnever be revived by any Governor who has at heart the interests of the\r\nCrown, and wishes that people should distinguish between what they owe\r\nto the indulgence of the Sovereign and what they may claim as their\r\nright by the laws of Virginia,\" wrote Governor Spotswood several years\r\nlater.[15]\r\n\r\nThe climate of Virginia, which was fatal to so many newcomers from\r\nEngland, took a heavy toll of Governors. Lord De la Warr fell a victim\r\nto the Virginia sickness; Herbert Jeffreys died after having been in the\r\ncolony only a few months. Now, on August 23, 1706, death ended the brief\r\nadministration of Governor Nott. He was mourned by the people, and was\r\nburied in Bruton Parish churchyard with all the solemnity the colony was\r\ncapable of. \"Had it pleased God to have spared him but a little time\r\nlonger amongst us, he would have healed all those unhappy differences\r\nthat have of late made us uneasy, and united us again to be one people,\"\r\nwrote William Bassett.[16]\r\n\r\nWhen the Council met after Nott's death they opened his commission and\r\nlistened intently as it was read. And there was great satisfaction when\r\nthey found that in the event of a Governor's death the Council was to\r\ntake on themselves the administration of the government. But they were\r\nfar from happy that Colonel Edmund Jenings, as the senior Councillor,\r\nwas to preside at their meetings with such powers as were necessary in\r\n\"carrying on the public service.\" They insisted that the Attorney\r\nGeneral of the colony, in drawing up the first proclamation under the\r\nnew government, should issue it, not under the name of the President\r\nalone, but of the President and Council.[17]\r\n\r\nJenings wrote to the Lords of Trade to ask just what his status should\r\nbe. Their answer was decisive. The instruction that the Council should\r\ntake over the government upon the death of a Governor had caused many\r\ncontroversies between the President and the Councillors and had greatly\r\nhindered public business. So they altered it to read: \"The eldest\r\nCouncillor do take upon him the administration of the government ... in\r\nthe same manner ... as other our Governor should do.\"[18]\r\n\r\nFrancis Nicholson had written the Lords of Trade some years previously\r\nexpressing doubts as to the wisdom of making any member of the Council\r\nthe chief executive. \"There may happen great disputes about the person\r\nof the President and his powers. And may be when the President and the\r\nCouncil are all natives or else entirely settled here, nature and\r\nself-interest may sway them to do some things and pass some acts that\r\nmay be (as they will imagine) for the good of their country and make and\r\nsecure an interest with the people. This may be prejudicial to their\r\nMajesties' service.\"[19] No doubt the Lords of Trade saw the force of\r\nthis reasoning, but they were not prepared to keep a Lieutenant Governor\r\nin Virginia whose only function it would be to wait around ready to step\r\nin when the Governor died or was recalled.\r\n\r\nAlthough the other members of the Council seem to have regarded Jenings\r\nwith something like scorn, and one of them had spoken of him as \"the\r\nright noble little Colonel Jenings,\" the man had had a distinguished\r\ncareer. He had been clerk of the York County court, collector of the\r\nYork River district, commissioner for the College of William and Mary,\r\nmember of the Council, Attorney General, and Secretary. And now, as\r\nPresident of the Council, he seems to have laid aside former\r\nanimosities, and considered himself merely first among equals.\r\n\r\nIt was taken for granted that Jenings' administration would be brief,\r\nand that a new Governor would come over as soon as one could be\r\nappointed. Word had come that a commission had been drawn up for Colonel\r\nRobert Hunter, and that he had sailed from Portsmouth in June, 1707. But\r\nmonth after month passed and he failed to appear. As late as March,\r\n1708, the Council was wondering what had become of him. At last they\r\nheard that the vessel in which he had shipped had been taken by the\r\nFrench, and that he was held captive in France. So they had to wait two\r\nmore years before a Governor arrived.[20]\r\n\r\nThis suited President Jenings and the Council, for it left them in\r\nundisputed control of the government. They even refused to hold an\r\nAssembly for fear it might question their proceedings. It is true that\r\nsix times they set the date for a meeting of the Assembly, but six times\r\nthey postponed it. At last, when people began to question whether these\r\nfrequent postponements did not put an end to the Assembly, the Council\r\nsettled all doubts by dissolving them by proclamation.\r\n\r\nThis was a dangerous thing to do, for it was in the midst of the War of\r\nthe Spanish Succession, and an Assembly was needed to provide funds for\r\nthe defense of the colony. But the Council gambled that no French fleet\r\nwould appear in the Chesapeake Bay. The normal expenses of the\r\ngovernment--their own salaries and those of the President, Auditor,\r\nAttorney General, and other officials--they paid out of the export duty\r\non tobacco and the quit rent fund. In September, 1708, Jenings wrote\r\nthat privateers had come in between the capes and had chased a merchant\r\nvessel up the York River, that the Indians were threatening the\r\nfrontier, that the Governor's house was unfinished, and that the quit\r\nrent fund was \"much drained,\" but that despite all, the Council would\r\nnot call an Assembly.[21]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1709, Lord George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney, was appointed\r\nGovernor General of Virginia. Orkney had been trained as a soldier, and\r\nhad distinguished himself at Namur, Blenheim, Malplaquet, and elsewhere.\r\nIt is probable that it was intended from the first that the office\r\nshould be a sinecure, and though Orkney held it for years he never set\r\nfoot on Virginia soil. But Virginia had to pay his salary, for his\r\nL1,000 a year was taken out of the export duty on tobacco. To carry on\r\nthe administration in the colony Colonel Alexander Spotswood was made\r\nLieutenant Governor.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that in the years from the recall of Nicholson to the\r\narrival of Spotswood, the danger to liberty in Virginia came less from\r\nthe Throne than from the Council. A free people could not be quiet under\r\nthe rule of a body of twelve men, not chosen by the voters but appointed\r\nby the sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe average planter, not only the owner of only a few acres, but the man\r\nof means had reason to be alarmed. Was it consistent with the principles\r\nof English liberty, they must have asked, for a clique of wealthy men,\r\nmany of them united in one family, to have such power over their lives\r\nand their property? If the people were to rule, final authority must be\r\nvested in the House of Burgesses, not the Council.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] CO5-1315, Bassett to Perry & Co., Aug. 30, 1706.\r\n\r\n[2] CO5-1314, Doc. 63iv.\r\n\r\n[3] Hugh Jones, _The present state of Virginia_, ed.

Two days later he met with the Council around the\r\noval table in the beautiful Council Chamber in the new Capitol, and laid\r\nhis commission before them.\r\n\r\nThe new Lieutenant Governor was descended from a family of Scottish\r\nAnglicans. His great-grandfather had seconded Archbishop Laud's attempt\r\nto introduce the Prayer Book in Scotland; his grandfather had been put\r\nto death by the Presbyterians. Perhaps it was this tragedy which induced\r\nhis father to desert his native land and take service in the English\r\narmy. It was while he was with his regiment in Tangier that Alexander\r\nSpotswood was born.\r\n\r\nThe son chose to follow in the father's footsteps, and in 1693 we find\r\nhim serving in the Earl of Bath's regiment in Flanders. He fought\r\ngallantly, was wounded at Blenheim, and was captured at Oudenarde. It is\r\npossible that he served under the Earl of Orkney, also, and that was the\r\nreason he named him as his deputy in Virginia. \"I must ever own\r\ngratefully that to your Lordship's good will I owe my station here,\" he\r\nwrote Orkney in 1718.\r\n\r\nSpotswood was one of the ablest Governors sent to America to represent\r\nthe British Crown. He did much to open the West to Virginia, encouraged\r\nsettlement in the Piedmont, and erected forts in the passes of the Blue\r\nRidge. He wiped out a nest of pirates under the notorious Blackbeard and\r\nstrung several of them up at Williamsburg. A man of artistic interests,\r\nhe was responsible for the beautiful Palace gardens, with their wealth\r\nof boxwood, walks, walls, lake, ornate gates, flower beds; and designed\r\ncharming Bruton Parish Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1716 he led a party of gentlemen, accompanied by rangers, servants,\r\nand Indians, on an exploring expedition to the West. As they rode\r\nthrough the wilderness of the Piedmont, they shot deer and bears, camped\r\nin the open, roasted venison on wooden forks. On reaching the Blue\r\nRidge they toiled to the summit, and there, looking out over the Valley\r\nof Virginia, drank the health of King George I and the royal family.\r\nAfter descending into the Valley and crossing the Shenandoah River, they\r\nturned their horses' heads homeward. Back in Williamsburg, the Governor\r\npresented each of his companions with a golden horseshoe, inscribed with\r\n_sic juvat transcendere montes_.\r\n\r\nAlthough Spotswood was accused of being haughty and implacable, he\r\nlacked the fiery temper of Nicholson or the revengeful fury of Sir\r\nWilliam Berkeley. In his conflicts with the Council his astute mind and\r\nhis knowledge of English and Virginia constitutional law made it easy\r\nfor him to refute their arguments. Though he defended the powers of the\r\nCrown, he was honestly concerned for the welfare of the colony. But he\r\nhated democracy, and he had no patience with what he termed the follies\r\nof the ignorant multitude. Despite his assaults on the Virginia\r\naristocracy, his ambition was to become one of them, and he used his\r\noffice to build up one of the greatest estates in the colony.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given Spotswood by the Lords of Trade were on the whole\r\nwise and liberal. The people of Virginia were to have the full benefit\r\nof the _habeas corpus_; fees and salaries must be moderate; no one must\r\nbe deprived of life, member, or property without due process of law;\r\nmartial law was forbidden; the people were to be supplied with arms. Yet\r\nseveral clauses were loaded with trouble for the Lieutenant\r\nGovernor--one for appointing courts to try criminals; another for\r\npreventing frauds in the accounts of governmental receipts and payments;\r\nanother for collecting arrears of quit rents; one to prevent the holding\r\nof large tracts of unoccupied land.\r\n\r\nWhen this last instruction was read to the Council, they must have\r\nshifted uneasily in their seats, for most of them held land which they\r\ndid not cultivate. Fourteen years earlier Edward Randolph had reported\r\nthis to the Lords of Trade. The reason the colony was so thinly settled,\r\nhe thought, was that poor men would not go there \"because members of the\r\nCouncil and others who made an interest in the government, have from\r\ntime to time procured grants of very large tracts of land.\" Thus\r\nnewcomers and indentured workers on becoming free were forced to be\r\ntenants or go to the utmost bounds of the colony. The remedy, he\r\nsuggested, was to force payment of arrears of quit rents and prohibit\r\nfor the future grants of more than 500 acres.[1]\r\n\r\nBoth Nott and Hunter had been instructed to cancel patents for land of\r\nany who neglected to cultivate even a small part of their holdings. So\r\nnow Spotswood, in the face of bitter opposition, restricted all grants\r\nto 400 acres unless the patentee showed that he was able to meet this\r\nrequirement. In 1710 he tried to satisfy the Lords of Trade by pushing\r\nthrough a law stating what should be considered satisfactory seating,\r\nand in 1713 another making the regulations still more specific.[2]\r\n\r\nThe chief effect of these acts was to arouse the resentment of the\r\nCouncil. They assented to them in their capacity as the Upper House of\r\nthe Assembly because they dared not flaunt openly the commands of the\r\nBritish government. But they found means to make them inoperative. The\r\nrumor was spread throughout the colony that the attorney general in\r\nEngland had ruled that no lands patented prior to the passage of these\r\nacts was liable to forfeiture. To ease men's fears, several large\r\nlandholders purposely refused to pay quit rents. Even John Grymes, the\r\ndeputy auditor into whose hands the quit rents were paid, himself\r\nremained in arrears \"to show no danger in that law.\"[3] Spotswood\r\nadmitted that the law was a failure when he wrote in 1718: \"No man in\r\nVirginia has yet had land granted away for non-payment of quit rents.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Spotswood came to Virginia there were many complaints of hard\r\ntimes. The war in Europe had proved disastrous to the tobacco trade, the\r\nflow of hogsheads to the continent of Europe had been reduced to a\r\ntrickle, tobacco piled up in the British warehouses, the merchants left\r\na part of each crop on the planters' hands, and the price dropped lower\r\nand lower. Many of the poorer farmers were in rags, and some began to\r\nraise sheep and to spin and weave. The salaried class, especially the\r\nclergy, were in dire straits also, since they were paid in tobacco,\r\noften of the lowest grade.\r\n\r\nThe fertile brain of Spotswood now thought out a scheme intended to\r\nraise the price of tobacco, give the colony a convenient and stable\r\ncurrency, make the collecting of quit rents easier, and prevent frauds\r\nin shipping out tobacco. So he got one of his friends in the Assembly to\r\nintroduce a bill to require inspection of all tobacco at government\r\nwarehouses, and the issuing of tobacco notes which were to be legal\r\ntender. This plan had much to recommend it, and a similar one was put\r\ninto successful operation later during the administration of Governor\r\nGooch.\r\n\r\nDespite violent opposition in certain quarters, the tobacco bill passed\r\nboth Houses of Assembly and was signed by the Governor. So now there\r\nwere sounds of hammering and sawing as warehouses arose on the great\r\nrivers. Soon the tobacco vessels were tying up at the adjacent wharves,\r\nand the planters were rolling their hogsheads for the inspection. After\r\nthe agent had examined the leaf, he either rejected it as \"trash\" and\r\nunfit for exportation, or stamped on the hogshead the weight and variety\r\nof the tobacco, and gave the owner his certificate.\r\n\r\nAt first everything seemed to be going smoothly. The quit rents were\r\ncollected in tobacco notes, the price of the leaf rose in the English\r\nmarket. The clergy wrote Spotswood thanking him for the increased value\r\nof their salaries. \"Their livings, which by the badness of the pay were\r\nsunk to little or nothing, begin now to be much more valuable by your\r\nwise and just contrivance to keep up the credit of the public\r\npayments.\"[4]\r\n\r\nNone the less, the law was unpopular. The debtor objected to paying in\r\nappreciated currency. It was a heavy expense for the planter to roll his\r\nhogsheads over the bad roads to the warehouses and then pay for\r\ninspection and storage. He was resentful if his tobacco was judged to be\r\nunfit for export. At the courthouses local politicians began to denounce\r\nthe act to willing listeners. \"He is the patriot who will not yield to\r\nwhatever the government proposes,\" complained Spotswood. \"Him they call\r\na poor man's friend who always carries still-yards to weigh to the needy\r\nplanter's advantage, and who never judges his tobacco to be trash.\"[5]\r\n\r\nSpotswood said that the tobacco act was looked upon to be the most\r\nextraordinary one that ever passed a Virginia Assembly. When he first\r\noutlined his plans for it his friends assured him it would be impossible\r\nto persuade the Assembly to pass it. Yet it was adopted unanimously by\r\nthe Council, and passed in the House \"with some address and great\r\nstruggle.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the Governor meant by \"address\" is revealed by an examination of\r\nthe list of fat jobs that he handed out to individual Burgesses. Of the\r\nfifty-one members, seventeen were justices of the peace. Fearing perhaps\r\nthat this did not assure the passage of his bill, he was lavish in\r\npromising tobacco agents' places, and no less than twenty-five Burgesses\r\ncast their votes with this job in sight. Only nineteen members failed to\r\nget one or the other of these posts, and some got both.[6] \"I have, in a\r\ngreat measure, I think, cleared the way for a Governor towards carrying\r\nany reasonable point in the House of Burgesses,\" Spotswood boasted, \"for\r\nhe will have in his disposal about forty agencies, which one with\r\nanother are likely to yield nigh 250 pounds per annum each.\"[7]\r\n\r\nBut Spotswood would not have been so pleased with himself if he had\r\nrealized the resentment which this open bribery of the people's\r\nrepresentatives caused throughout the colony. The Assembly \"gave him all\r\nthings asked, and he them agent's places to pick our pockets,\" said one\r\ndisgruntled planter. But what the officeholder had to expect if he\r\nopposed the measures urged by the Governor is shown by his treatment of\r\nNicholas Meriwether. When Meriwether not only spoke against the tobacco\r\nbill in the Assembly, but by \"many seditious speeches\" denounced it to\r\nthe people of New Kent County, Spotswood promptly removed him from his\r\nplace as justice of the peace. This, he thought, would discourage others\r\nfrom following his example.\r\n\r\nHaving corrupted the Burgesses and made most of them his henchmen,\r\nSpotswood would have no doubt continued them indefinitely by successive\r\nadjournments, had they not been automatically dissolved by the death of\r\nQueen Anne. \"By a good providence we were delivered from them, else they\r\nwould have continued as long as he,\" wrote Joshua Gee.[8] Just how\r\npassively the people would have submitted to another long Assembly must\r\nremain a matter of speculation, but their resentment against both\r\nSpotswood and his puppets is shown by their selections for the House of\r\nBurgesses in 1715. Of the twenty-five members who had accepted agents'\r\njobs, only one, William Armistead, of Elizabeth City, was returned. And\r\nthe voters of New Kent showed their anger at Spotswood's treatment of\r\nMeriwether by returning him to the House. Altogether only sixteen\r\nBurgesses of the old House had seats in the new, and of these eleven had\r\nbeen neither agents nor justices.\r\n\r\nSpotswood was deeply resentful. The new Burgesses, he thought, were a\r\nset of ignorant demagogues, determined to oppose anything he suggested.\r\nIt was all the fault of the law which permitted any man to vote who\r\nowned any real estate, even half an acre. Just before an election\r\nreports were spread that the country was on the verge of ruin, and no\r\none was qualified to save it but \"some of their own mobbish\r\npoliticians.\" It was no wonder that some of the Burgesses could not\r\nwrite grammatical English, since the ignorant people insisted on\r\nelecting men of their own stamp.[9]\r\n\r\nThe new Assembly was as hostile to the Governor as their predecessors\r\nhad been subservient. Everything he proposed they objected to, in some\r\ncases for no other reason than to thwart him. They were egged on by\r\nGawin Corbin, who had been ousted from his job as naval officer; George\r\nMarable, whom Spotswood had removed from the James City County court;\r\nand Edwin Conway, of Lancaster County. But the whole atmosphere of the\r\nHouse was one of hostility.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the House been organized than grievances from various\r\ncounties poured in, most of them complaining against the tobacco law.\r\nThe people of Surry prayed that the law be repealed, the people of\r\nHenrico wanted it repealed, the people of Essex wanted it repealed, the\r\npeople of Warwick complained of the hardships of the law. It seemed that\r\nno more than two counties in all Virginia were satisfied.[10] Spotswood\r\nclaimed that these grievances did not represent the views of a majority\r\nof the people. Many of them were drawn up by members of the House, some\r\nwere signed at election fields, horse races, and drunken meetings. \"Nor\r\nshall a seditious paper, signed by five obscure fellows who must have a\r\nscribe to write all their names, ever pass with me for a county\r\ngrievance.\"[11]\r\n\r\nWhen Richard Littlepage and Thomas Butts, two of the justices of New\r\nKent, refused to certify the grievances of that county, they were\r\narrested under the Speaker's warrant. Though the House voted them guilty\r\nof high misdemeanor and contempt, they refused to appear, claiming that\r\nthe Burgesses had no legal authority over them. Thereupon the House\r\nappealed to the Governor to arrest them. \"The freedom and privileges of\r\nthis House are in danger of being utterly subverted,\" they said, \"when\r\njustices ... assume a jurisdiction and by their judgment debar the\r\npeople and their rightful representatives of the rightful ways ... for\r\nredressing their grievances ... we believe that such matters do concern\r\nthe Burgesses in Assembly.\"[12] But Spotswood rebuffed them. They were\r\nexceeding their authority, he told them, when they persecuted justices\r\nand tried to punish them for their proceedings on the bench.\r\n\r\nIn his anger at not being able to control the Burgesses, Spotswood tried\r\nto make the House less democratic by restricting the right to vote. But\r\nnot daring to reveal his intention, he approached the question in a\r\nroundabout way. In September, 1715, he sent out a printed letter to all\r\nof the county courts, questioning whether the justices should levy a tax\r\nto pay the Burgesses' salaries when no law existed empowering them to do\r\nso.[13] To the Lords of Trade he explained that if the justices declined\r\nto pay the levy, \"the Burgesses must have become suitors for an act\r\nwherein might properly have been described the qualifications of the\r\nelectors and elected.\"[14] In other words, he was prepared to veto any\r\nbill to legalize the collecting of salaries that did not disfranchise\r\nthe small landholder and restrict the right to sit in the House to the\r\nwell-to-do. So he kept mum on the fact that the salaries could be\r\nassessed by the sheriffs on a writ, as was the practice in England.\r\n\r\nBut in this matter he was balked by the members of the Council. Carter,\r\nBlair, Ludwell, and the others no doubt guessed what Spotswood was\r\naiming at, and they were unwilling to have him undermine the very\r\nfoundations of liberty in Virginia. So in the General Court they passed\r\n\"an unpreceded sentence\" to levy the Burgesses' salary on the private\r\nestates of the justices if they refused \"to levy it on their\r\ncounties.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe House asserted in no uncertain terms its right to judge of the\r\nelection and qualifications of its members. When they heard that William\r\nCole and Cole Digges, of Warwick County, had promised the voters that if\r\nelected they would serve without salary, they refused to seat them. A\r\nnew election was held in which, presumably, no such promise was made,\r\nand Cole and Digges were again elected, and this time permitted to take\r\ntheir seats.[16] Spotswood taunted the House for not grasping at this\r\nopportunity to reduce the heavy burden of the poll tax, and the Council\r\nthought there was neither law nor practice to justify their action.[17]\r\nYet the Burgesses were right, not only in regarding Cole and Digges'\r\noffer as bribery, but in claiming that it was contrary to a law passed\r\nin October, 1705.[18]\r\n\r\nThe House now made a major assault upon the powers of the Governor. The\r\ntime had come, they thought, to put an end to the bribing of its members\r\nwith lucrative jobs, which had been done with such pernicious\r\nconsequences by Berkeley, Nicholson, and others. They passed an act\r\nmaking it unlawful for any Burgess to be also a naval officer, tobacco\r\nagent, clerk of a county court, or hold any other office of profit in\r\nthe government. They next tried to put an end to long Assemblies by\r\nprohibiting their continuance for more than three years. A third measure\r\n\"for ascertaining secretaries', sheriffs', clerks' and constables' fees\"\r\nwas designed to make the bait of office less attractive. These bills\r\naroused Spotswood's ire, for he saw immediately that they were designed\r\nto strike the vital power of patronage from his hands and the hands of\r\nhis successors. So he vetoed all three.\r\n\r\nThe Governor's main purpose in calling the Assembly of 1715 was to have\r\nthem vote assistance to South Carolina in that colony's bloody struggle\r\nwith a powerful confederation of Indians. \"We must appear to have\r\nneither policy nor bowels of compassion, if this government can remain\r\nunconcerned while savage pagans are overwhelming one of our adjacent\r\nprovinces, and inhumanly butchering and torturing our brethren,\" he told\r\nthe Burgesses in his opening address.[19] To them South Carolina seemed\r\na long way off. They had troubles enough at home without sending men and\r\nmoney there, but, since the Governor was so set on it, they would yield\r\nif he would consent to something they wanted.\r\n\r\nThey passed a bill to raise L450 for the purchase of supplies for South\r\nCarolina, but tacked on a rider for the repeal of the hated tobacco act.\r\nThis, of course, Spotswood vetoed. To let it pass, he thought, would be\r\nan act of high injustice, since upon the faith of the tobacco law at\r\nleast L7,000 had been spent in erecting warehouses and wharves, and in\r\nthe purchase of scales.[20] Neither he nor the Burgesses realized that\r\nthe law was under attack in England. The merchants were dissatisfied\r\nwith it, and Solicitor General William Thompson held that it was an act\r\nin restraint of trade. In July, 1717, the act was vetoed by King George\r\nI.[21]\r\n\r\nSpotswood closed the session with an ill-natured and bitter denunciation\r\nof the Burgesses. \"The true interest of your country is not what you\r\nhave troubled your heads about,\" he said. \"All your proceedings have\r\nbeen calculated to answer the notions of the ignorant populace, and if\r\nyou can excuse yourselves to them, you matter not how you stand before\r\nGod, your Prince, and all judicious men or before any others to whom you\r\nthink you owe not your elections.... In fine, I cannot but attribute\r\nthose miscarriages to the people's mistaken choice of a set of\r\nrepresentatives whom Heaven has not generally endowed with the ordinary\r\nqualifications requisite to legislators, for I observe that the grand\r\nruling party in your House has not furnished chairmen for two of your\r\nstanding committees who can spell English or write common sense. And to\r\nkeep such an Assembly on foot would be discrediting a country that has\r\nmany able and worthy gentlemen in it. And therefore I dissolve you.\"[22]\r\n\r\nHaving insulted the Burgesses and the people who had elected them,\r\nSpotswood next incurred the enmity of a majority of the Council. The\r\ntrouble started when he laid before them the instruction requiring him\r\nto see that fair books of accounts be kept of the Crown revenues.[23]\r\nSince only the gross sums had been reported and itemized accounts kept\r\nonly on \"loose papers,\" he demanded that the Auditor and the Receiver\r\nGeneral adopt more businesslike methods. To this Receiver General\r\nWilliam Byrd and Auditor Ludwell replied that they kept their accounts\r\nas their predecessors had kept them and in accordance with instructions\r\nfrom the Auditor General for all the colonies.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Byrd left for England, taking with him, if we may\r\nbelieve Spotswood, \"all the books of the revenue.\" The Governor then\r\ndemanded of Ludwell whether or not he intended to comply with the\r\ninstruction to keep account books. Ludwell replied that he could not\r\nchange the old method without orders from the Auditor General. Since\r\nthis was nothing less than setting up the authority of this officer\r\nagainst that of the King, the Governor thought the excuse a very poor\r\none. So, in January, 1716, he ousted both Ludwell and Byrd from\r\noffice.[24]\r\n\r\nNo doubt there had been confusion in the accounts, and no doubt\r\nSpotswood's insistence on having account books would have done much to\r\nbring them into order. It is possible, also, that there had been much\r\nremissness in paying taxes and some fraud. The Governor wrote the Lords\r\nof Trade: \"Notwithstanding all the contrivances of the family to justify\r\nthe late officers of the revenue, here is now demonstration, not only of\r\ndarkness and confusion in the manner of collecting the quit rents, but\r\nlikewise of frauds and errors in accounting for the King's revenue.\"[25]\r\n\r\nRealizing that he had brought down on himself the hostility of the\r\nCouncillors, Spotswood now tried to undermine their power by setting up\r\ncourts of oyer and terminer to which he appointed persons other than\r\nthemselves. The General Court, on which all members of the Council and\r\nnone else sat, had long been the court of last appeal in the colony. The\r\nCouncillors prized their seats in this court not less than their seats\r\nin the Upper House of Assembly or around the Council table. Spotswood\r\nclaimed that their power over the lives and property of the people made\r\nall regard them with awe, and \"kept the country in subjection to their\r\nparty.\"[26] \"They know that they have now lodged wholly in their hands\r\nthat power that Absalom wanted for effectually securing the people in\r\nhis interest, when he longed to be the judge of every man's cause.\"[27]\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected, then, that they should insist that none but\r\nthemselves should sit on the new court of oyer and terminer. In May,\r\n1717, eight of them met in secret and drew up a letter to the Lords of\r\nTrade defending their position. The charter of 1676 expressly stated\r\nthat the Governor and Council had authority to try \"all treasons,\r\nmurders, felonies.\" The laws of Virginia made the Governor and Council\r\nthe supreme court. They could not believe that a Governor could \"break\r\nthrough laws and charters and alter all the ancient usage and tradition\r\nof the government.\"[28]\r\n\r\nSpotswood also appealed to the Lords of Trade. And he was overjoyed when\r\nthis body wrote him that they could not see what reason the Council had\r\nto insist upon being the sole judges of the new court since his\r\ncommission empowered him to \"appoint judges.\"[29] They were backed by\r\nAttorney General Edward Northy in his opinion of December 24, 1717.\r\nNorthy advised, however, that Governors be instructed not to hold courts\r\nof oyer and terminer except in cases of \"extraordinary emergency.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThe test came in December, 1718, when the court of oyer and terminer was\r\nabout to begin its session. Several Councillors had taken their seats\r\nwhen Spotswood announced that he was joining with them Mr. Cole Digges\r\nand Mr. Peter Beverley. Since neither was a member of the Council,\r\nLudwell and four others got up and left. The five then drew up a\r\nremonstrance, which Ludwell presented to Spotswood in court, with a\r\n\"long harangue.\" Noticing that people were gathering, he turned around,\r\nand raising his voice, addressed them. \"The Governor's power of naming\r\nother judges than the Councillors in life and death cases is of\r\ndangerous consequence to the lives and liberties of free subjects,\" he\r\nsaid. \"For that reason I refuse to sit in the court of oyer and terminer\r\nwith those gentlemen.\"[31]\r\n\r\nIn London, Byrd pleaded the cause of the Council before the Lords of\r\nTrade. It would be fatal, he argued, to permit a Governor to try any\r\nperson by what judges he thought proper. \"Whoever has had the fortune to\r\nlive in the plantations knows that Governors are not in the least exempt\r\nfrom human frailties, such as passionate love of money, resentment\r\nagainst such as presume to oppose their designs, particularly to their\r\ncreatures and favorites.\"[32] To this Spotswood retorted: \"What else\r\ncould tempt the ruling party in the Council so strenuously to insist on\r\na right, never claimed before, of being judges of oyer and terminer, but\r\nthe desire of gaining to one family an entire power over the lives, as\r\nthey now have over the estates, of the people of Virginia?\"[33]\r\n\r\nTo the Earl of Orkney, Spotswood wrote bitterly. If he lost his battle\r\nwith the Council, future Governors would think it folly to oppose them.\r\n\"I take the power, interest, and reputation of the King's Governor in\r\nthis dominion to be now reduced to a desperate gasp, and if the present\r\nefforts of the country cannot add new vigor to the same, then the\r\nhaughtiness of a Carter, the hypocrisy of a Blair, the inveteracy of a\r\nLudwell, the brutishness of a Smith, the malice of a Byrd, the\r\nconceitedness of a Grymes, and the scurrility of a Corbin, with about a\r\nscore of base disloyalists and ungrateful Creolians for their adherents,\r\nmust for the future rule the province.\"[34]\r\n\r\nSince the Virginia treasury was now overflowing as a result of peace in\r\nEurope and the shipping out of vast quantities of tobacco, Spotswood\r\nmanaged to get along without an Assembly for three years. He would\r\nprobably have continued to do so indefinitely, had he not wanted an act\r\nto reimburse the Indian Company which had been dissolved by order of the\r\nKing. The trade with the Indians had recently become a mere trickle,\r\nbecause South Carolina had confiscated the goods of some Virginia\r\ntraders, and lawless savages had robbed others. So an act was passed in\r\n1714 under which a monopoly of the trade with the southern tribes was\r\nlodged in the Virginia Indian Company.\r\n\r\nIn return the company was required to contribute L100 towards building a\r\npublic magazine at Williamsburg, to garrison and keep in repair a fort\r\nat Christanna on the frontier, and erect a schoolhouse there for Indian\r\nchildren. Some of the leading men in the colony became stockholders,\r\namong them William Cocke, Mann Page, William Cole, Nathaniel Harrison,\r\nand Cole Digges. They had spent large sums \"in purchasing servants,\r\ntaking up land and making settlements on the frontier, clearing roads,\r\nand building warehouses,\" when word came that the act under which they\r\noperated had been vetoed by the King.[35] Since they were now left\r\nholding the bag, they asked that the Assembly reimburse them.\r\n\r\nThe election which followed was one of the bitterest in Virginia\r\nhistory. Spotswood made full use of the patronage. \"Commissions flew\r\nabout to every fellow that could make two or three votes,\" wrote Joshua\r\nGee. \"He gave the power to his friends to make a discreet use of [them].\r\nAnd indeed never fouler play was by men, than at most of our\r\nelections.\"[36] Political pamphlets were distributed at every\r\ncourthouse. One of them began: \"Having seen a rascally paper which\r\ncontained advice to freeholders in favor of a court party and tools of\r\narbitrary power to enslave and ruin a free born people ... to prevent\r\nwhich I thought it my duty to open your eyes.... You are to know,\r\nbrother electors, that this Assembly is called for no other reason but\r\nto pay to the Indian Company their charges on Fort Christanna, if they\r\ncan get a set of men fit for that purpose to gull into that unjust\r\npayment.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the election was another defeat for the Governor. No less\r\nthan thirty-four members of the hostile House of Burgesses of 1715 were\r\nreturned. Of the new members Gawin Corbin, John Grymes, Archibald Blair,\r\nand others were bitter enemies of Spotswood. During the session the\r\nGovernor kept his temper, since he had been ordered to do so by the\r\nLords of Trade, but the Burgesses, remembering his former insults, did\r\neverything they could to annoy him. Though his opening address was\r\nconciliatory, it was greeted with \"violent censures.\" One wrathful\r\nmember \"shot his bolt\" and cried out: \"It is all stuff and calculated\r\nonly for the latitude of Whitehall.\" When Spotswood laid before the\r\nHouse several letters from New York in regard to renewing a treaty with\r\nthe Indians, \"they made it their jest, and setting up a great laugh ...\r\ncried out in their vulgar language, 'A bite!'\"[38]\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Spotswood got practically nothing out of this Assembly.\r\nThey refused to repay the Indian Company for what they had laid out for\r\nthe defense of the colony. They refused to pay for a proposed trip to\r\nNew York by Spotswood to renew the treaty with the Iroquois. To his\r\nrequest for payment of his expenses in making fatiguing journeys in the\r\nservice of the country, they replied, \"we hope they will give you the\r\nsatisfaction of reflecting that you have deserved the salary allowed by\r\nhis Majesty.\"[39]\r\n\r\nBut the Burgesses were not yet done with him. Late in the session, when\r\nit seemed that nothing more of importance was to come before them, and\r\nsome had gone home and others were at the race track, the \"party\r\nmanagers\" brought in an address to the King with a long string of\r\naccusations against him. Spotswood intimates that Blair and Ludwell were\r\nresponsible for this maneuver in order to have the House second the\r\ncomplaints of the Council. Blair made his influence felt through his\r\nbrother, Archibald Blair, and Ludwell through his son-in-law, John\r\nGrymes. \"As during the last two sessions the one has scarce let a day\r\npass without dropping in the Assembly some scurrilous reflection upon\r\nme,\" Spotswood wrote, \"so the other can't keep his temper when he\r\nperceives any matter agreeable to me is likely to be carried.\"[40]\r\n\r\nThe accusations, which were embodied in instructions to William Byrd II\r\nas agent for the House, were carried by a vote of twenty-two to\r\nfourteen. But when they were considered one by one most of them were\r\nstruck out. In their final form the accusations boiled down to little\r\nmore than that the Governor had misconstrued the laws, that he had tried\r\nto keep the justices from levying the salaries of the Burgesses, and\r\nthat he had by provoking speeches and messages abused the House.[41]\r\nSpotswood, in two long papers, had no difficulty in answering the\r\ncharges, but they remained as convincing evidence that there existed\r\nwidespread dissatisfaction with his administration.\r\n\r\nTo counteract this impression he now followed the precedent set by\r\nNicholson of seeking flattering addresses. \"To support his cause tools\r\nwere picked to make up grand juries to deliver fulsome addresses to the\r\nGovernor and abuse the Council and Assembly,\" Joshua Gee tells us. \"The\r\nsame tools made addresses from the courts and even engaged every\r\nbarefooted fellow to sign addresses from the counties.\"[42] The address\r\nfrom Middlesex spoke of Spotswood's wise and moderate government; that\r\nof the \"justices, clergy, and principal inhabitants\" of New Kent\r\ndeclared that his character had been traduced; that of King and Queen\r\nCounty that the charges against him were false. All in all, the\r\naddresses came from twenty-one of the twenty-five counties.[43]\r\n\r\nThis deluge of praise must have had its influence with the Lords of\r\nTrade and the Earl of Orkney. But more convincing was the logic of\r\nSpotswood's letters in which he answered the charges against him. He had\r\nbrought down on his head the hostility of the Councillors and Burgesses\r\nthrough his efforts to carry out their Lordships' orders and uphold the\r\nprerogative of the King, he said. To remove him for doing his duty would\r\nrender the situation hopeless for future Governors.\r\n\r\nSo, despite the arguments and pleading of William Byrd, both Orkney and\r\nthe Lords of Trade gave Spotswood their support. Orkney thought that no\r\nessential complaint had been brought against him, and praised him for\r\nputting the government of Virginia upon a much improved footing.[44] The\r\nBoard of Trade wrote Spotswood, in June, 1719: \"You may depend upon all\r\nthe countenance and support which we can give you which we think you\r\nhave deserved.\"[45] It was rumored in Virginia, also, that the Board was\r\nconsidering removing from the Council some of the Governor's bitterest\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nYet at the moment of triumph, Spotswood, instead of lauding it over the\r\nCouncillors and forcing them to submit, seemed anxious to compromise all\r\ndifferences. The key to his moderation is found in his opening address\r\nto the Burgesses in November, 1720: \"To consider the stake I have among\r\nyou and the free choice I've made to fix it under this government, you\r\nhave not surely any grounds to suspect me of injurious designs against\r\nthe welfare of this colony.\"[46] Then he indulged in a metaphor to show\r\nthat the interests of Virginia and Great Britain did not conflict. \"I\r\nlook upon Virginia as a rib taken from Britain's side, and believe that\r\nwhile they both proceed as living under the marriage contract, this Eve\r\nmust thrive as long as her Adam flourishes.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, Spotswood did not want to continue his differences with\r\nthe planter aristocracy because he planned to become one of them. In\r\n1716 he had acquired 3,229 acres on the Rappahannock, known as the\r\nGermanna Tract, and peopled it with German tenants. Three years later he\r\ngranted 3,065 acres, the so-called Wilderness Tract, to a certain\r\nRichard Hickman, who transferred it to him. He next acquired the Fork\r\nTract, the Barrows Tract, the Mine Tract of 15,000 acres, the Lower\r\nMassaponax Tract, and the Upper Massaponax Tract. In 1729, when the new\r\ncounty of Spotsylvania was created, the Governor owned 25,000 acres\r\nwithin its borders.[47] On his Mine Tract he had invested so heavily in\r\nan iron foundry that Byrd called him the Tubal Cain of Virginia.\r\n\r\nSo, when Nathaniel Harrison approached him with proposals for a\r\nreconciliation, Spotswood was quite willing to do his part. But there\r\nwere long negotiations before peace was concluded. On May 16, 1718, when\r\nthe Governor made new overtures, they were greeted by stiffness and\r\nreserve. Yet the Councillors at his invitation, went from the Capitol to\r\nthe Palace, and there gathered around a bowl of arrack, drinking until\r\nmidnight. On the other hand, the hostile eight shunned Spotswood's\r\ncelebration of the King's birthday, \"got together all the turbulent and\r\ndisaffected Burgesses, had an entertainment of their own in the\r\nBurgesses House, and invited all the mob to a bonfire, where they were\r\nplentifully supplied with liquors.\"[48]\r\n\r\nIn the end the Councillors came to terms. Smith and Berkeley were dead,\r\nwhile Carter, Blair, Ludwell, Lewis, Byrd, and Harrison had seen the\r\nhandwriting on the wall. At a meeting in the Council Chamber of the\r\nCapitol, in April 1720, with Spotswood at the head of the table, it was\r\nagreed that all past controversies be forgotten, and that in the future\r\nthere should be no other contention than who should most promote the\r\nKing's service and the public benefit of the colony.[49]\r\n\r\nFor some months there was comparative quiet in Virginia. But in 1721\r\nSpotswood became uneasy when James Blair decided to visit England. \"He\r\nis continually assuring me of all the service he can do me at home,\" the\r\nGovernor wrote to the Bishop of London, \"but ... I shall be contented\r\nwith his not offering to do me any disservice.\"[50] These fears were\r\nwell-grounded, for there is reason to think that the Commissary was\r\ninstrumental in having him removed from office, just how is not known.\r\nIt is significant that when it was rumored that a new Governor was\r\ncoming over, \"it was understood that Parson Blair was likely to act as\r\nprime minister.\" Significant, also, is it that Hugh Drysdale, who\r\nsucceeded Spotswood early in 1722, came to Virginia on the same vessel\r\nas Blair, and remained on the most intimate terms with him throughout\r\nhis short administration.[51]\r\n\r\nSpotswood's last act as Lieutenant Governor reflects no credit upon his\r\ncharacter, and did disservice both to the Crown and colony. Upon hearing\r\nthat he was to be removed, he made out patents for huge tracts of land\r\nin Spotsylvania County to certain persons who immediately conveyed them\r\nto him.[52] He later adopted a system of tenantry, leasing land in small\r\nparcels for two generations, a system which was copied in the huge\r\nVirginia manors developed in western Virginia late in the century.\r\nAlthough tenantry hastened settlement, it was inconsistent with the\r\ndemocratic spirit of the frontier, and was largely abolished by the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Blakiston said of Spotswood: \"That gentleman has real capacity\r\nand talents to manage in a high sphere, but he adheres too much to his\r\nown sentiments, and thinks himself ill-treated if everybody does not\r\nthink as he does.\"[53] This weakness accounts in part for his inability\r\nto get along with either the Council or the Burgesses. Many of the\r\npolicies which he advocated were wise, but his attempts to force them\r\nthrough were unwise. When the Council opposed him he tried to break\r\ntheir power; when the Burgesses thwarted him, he tried to bribe them\r\ninto submission.\r\n\r\nSpotswood's administration was marked by several years of great\r\nprosperity, by the expansion of the frontier, by the attempts to develop\r\nmanufactures, by the regulation of the tobacco trade; but more important\r\nwas the demonstration that the people would no longer permit their\r\nrepresentatives in the Assembly to be made submissive to the Governor by\r\nthe use of the patronage. The punishment which they meted out to the\r\nfaithless in the Assembly of 1714 marked a notable advance along the\r\nroad to liberty, and was a warning to future Governors not to attempt to\r\nrule by corruption.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] CO5-1315, Doc. 26.\r\n\r\n[2] W.

In\r\nEngland the government, under the leadership of Sir Robert Walpole,\r\nadopted a conciliatory policy toward the colonies, the famous policy of\r\nletting sleeping dogs lie. Great Britain was reaping huge profits from\r\nthe trade with America, and the chief concern of the Board of Trade was\r\nto see that no laws were passed by the Assemblies to lessen them. On the\r\nother hand, the colonies were permitted to govern themselves to a degree\r\nthat would not have been tolerated under the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nPossibly it was by chance that the two Lieutenant Governors whose\r\nadministrations covered this period--Hugh Drysdale and William\r\nGooch--were admirably suited to carry out this policy. Or they may have\r\nbeen selected because of their winning personalities, their ability to\r\nsee both sides of a question, their desire to do justice to all men,\r\ntheir lack of greed and ambition to dictate. We know that Drysdale was\r\nrecommended to the Earl of Orkney by Walpole himself.[1] At all events,\r\nafter contending for years with the implacable Nicholson and the\r\ndictatorial Spotswood, Drysdale and Gooch must have seemed gifts from\r\nHeaven to the Virginians.\r\n\r\nDrysdale arrived in Virginia on September 25, 1722, and two days later\r\nwas sworn in in the Council Chamber. He was heartily welcomed. A few\r\nmonths later he could report that there was \"universal contentment on\r\nthe change made in the government,\" and that his administration had the\r\napprobation of all ranks of people.[2] In marked contrast to their wordy\r\nwar with Spotswood, the Burgesses showed him only respect and affection.\r\n\"We must acknowledge the present calm and tranquility to be the\r\nconsequences of your prudence and moderation,\" they told him.[3] When\r\nhe was planning to leave for England because of ill health, they\r\naddressed the King to say that his speedy return would be a great\r\nhappiness to the people of the colony.[4]\r\n\r\nDrysdale's popularity was based more on what he did not do than what he\r\ndid do. He made no attempt to undermine the judicial power of the\r\nCouncil, he seems not to have used the patronage to control the House of\r\nBurgesses, he did not try to make the colony less democratic by\r\nrestricting the right to vote, he did not deny to the Burgesses their\r\nancient privileges, he did not use his office for personal gain.\r\n\r\nHe was at first critical of the policy, favored by the Council, of\r\nissuing patents for huge tracts of land. His predecessor had granted\r\nsome for 10,000 acres, some for 20,000 acres, some for 40,000 acres\r\ndespite the order that I,000 acres should be the limit. \"Thus the\r\nintention of the government to make Spotsylvania a well inhabited\r\nfrontier is frustrated,\" he said.[5]\r\n\r\nBut the Councillors and other men of wealth persuaded him that large\r\nholdings which could be cut up into small farms and leased to tenants\r\nhastened rather than retarded settlement. \"The Council are of opinion\r\nthat the limiting the quantity of land to be taken up in the new\r\ncounties is prejudicial and a discouragement to their speedy\r\nsettlement,\" he wrote in July, 1724.[6] He did not stop to consider that\r\nthe growth of tenantry would be a blow, not only to economic democracy,\r\nbut political democracy as well, since tenants, unless they were also\r\nfreeholders, had no right to vote.\r\n\r\nDrysdale called for an election for a new Assembly who met in the\r\nCapitol on May 9, 1723. The Burgesses had hardly settled themselves in\r\ntheir seats when they took up two cases which concerned the rights of\r\nthe people and their privileges. In Essex County grievances had been\r\npresented to the court for certification to the Assembly, charging\r\nColonel Joseph Smith, commander of the county militia, with harsh and\r\nillegal conduct while a member of a court-martial. Colonel Smith,\r\nhimself a member of the court, refused to sign this paper, so that it\r\nfailed to reach the House. Thereupon the Burgesses declared him \"guilty\r\nof a breach of his duty,\" and ordered the Speaker to reprimand him.[7]\r\nIn striking contrast to Spotswood's upholding of Littlefield and Butts\r\nin a similar case, Drysdale backed the House by removing Smith from the\r\ncounty court.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the other case a certain William Hopkins was accused of \"rude,\r\ncontemptuous, and indecent\" language in the House about one of the\r\nmembers--Mr. Matthew Kemp. When he was adjudged guilty and ordered on\r\nhis knees to ask the pardon of the Burgesses and Mr. Kemp, he flatly\r\nrefused. It was then ordered that he be led through the Duke of\r\nGloucester Street, from the Capitol to the college gate and back, with a\r\nplacard pinned to his breast bearing the following inscription: \"For\r\ninsolent behavior at the bar of the House of Burgesses, when he was\r\nthere as an offender and with obstinacy and contempt disobeying their\r\norder.\" This prospect was too much for Hopkins, so, no doubt with inward\r\ncurses, he made the apology.[9]\r\n\r\nThere was universal grief in Virginia when Drysdale died, on July 22,\r\n1726. He was buried with elaborate ceremonies, to the booming of cannon.\r\nThe Council wrote Mrs. Drysdale expressing \"the just sense\" of \"the\r\npublic loss,\" and giving her permission to remain for the time being in\r\nthe Palace.[10] Pending the appointment of a new Lieutenant Governor,\r\nthey voted to make Robert Carter President. The selection normally would\r\nhave gone to Edmund Jenings, as the senior member of the Council, but he\r\nhad just been suspended because of his age and because he was much\r\n\"decayed in his understanding.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Gooch, who was appointed to succeed Drysdale, took the oath of\r\noffice on September 11, 1727. It must have been with apprehension that\r\nthe members of the Council greeted him. It would be too much to expect\r\nthat the colony would have in succession two Governors of the stamp of\r\nDrysdale. Might not the new arrival be another Spotswood, or even\r\nanother Nicholson?\r\n\r\nThey were not long kept in doubt. Gooch proved to be one of the most\r\npopular Governors in the history of the colony. Sincerely interested in\r\nthe welfare of the people, conciliatory in his dealings with both the\r\nCouncil and the Burgesses, he brought internal peace and contentment.\r\nThe story was told of him that one day when in the company of several\r\ngentlemen, he happened to pass a Negro slave. When the Negro lifted his\r\nhat, Gooch lifted his in return.\r\n\r\n\"What, Governor Gooch, do you lift your hat to a slave?\" one of his\r\ncompanions asked.\r\n\r\n\"I would be deeply humiliated to be surpassed in courtesy by a slave,\"\r\nwas the reply.\r\n\r\nThroughout Gooch's administration there was practically no friction\r\nbetween the Governor and the Assembly. The public affairs were carried\r\non in perfect harmony and good understanding, he reported in 1734. The\r\naddress of the Speaker of the House of Burgesses, Sir John Randolph, to\r\nGooch is one of the most remarkable in Virginia history. \"You have\r\nshew'd how easy it is to give universal satisfaction to the people under\r\nyour government.... You have not been intoxicated with the power\r\ncommitted to you by his Majesty, but have used it like a faithful\r\ntrustee for the public good.... You never propose matters without\r\nsupposing your opinion subject to the examination of others, nor strive\r\nto make other men's reason blindly and implicitly obedient to yours....\r\nYou have extirpated all factions among us ... and plainly proved that\r\nnone can arise, or be lasting, but from the countenance and\r\nencouragement of a Governor.\"[11]\r\n\r\nBoth the Council and the Burgesses expressed their gratitude to Gooch by\r\ngifts of money, the former voting him L300 to cover the expense of his\r\nvoyage to Virginia, and the latter giving him L500. Although his\r\ninstructions forbade his acceptance, he pocketed the money. \"I thought\r\nit would not become me to refuse this extraordinary instance of their\r\nregard,\" he wrote the Lords of Trade. There was a precedent for his\r\nacceptance, for Nicholson had had L300 when that sum was worth L600 in\r\nthe present currency. And though the Board censured him, they did not\r\nmake him refund the money.[12]\r\n\r\nIt was typical of Gooch that he was willing to yield in matters of which\r\nhe did not fully approve in order to carry points which he had very much\r\nat heart. He had not been long in the colony when he came to the\r\nconclusion that it would greatly benefit the planters if the tobacco\r\ninspection act of 1713 could be revived. But he was well aware that the\r\npeople had not forgotten the use Spotswood had made of it to gain\r\ncontrol of the House of Burgesses, or his veto of the bill to prohibit\r\nBurgesses from holding places of profit in the government. So, in\r\nreturn for the passage of a new tobacco law, he assented to an act to\r\nkeep officeholders out of the House. \"The Burgesses were for this bill,\"\r\nhe wrote the Lords of Trade, \"and my desire to keep them in good humor\r\nwhile matters of greater moment were under their deliberation, prevailed\r\nwith me to assent to it.\"[13]\r\n\r\nBut he thought that the act had nothing in its favor, except that it was\r\nan imitation of the laws of England made for securing the freedom of\r\nParliament. \"In my humble opinion this country is yet too young for so\r\nrefined a regulation. Places of profit are indeed but few, but men of\r\ncapacity for the discharge of them do not much more abound; therefore\r\neither the government must be ill served, or the House of Burgesses\r\nmeanly fitted if men of capacity and integrity must be shut out either\r\nof the one or the other.\"[14]\r\n\r\nGooch either did not understand the importance of this bill, or\r\ndeliberately concealed it from the British Government. Had he known of\r\nthe use of the power of appointment by former Governors to gain control\r\nof the House of Burgesses, he could not have dismissed the measure so\r\nlightly. Nor could he have realized what a major victory it was for\r\nliberty. Henceforth no Berkeley could bribe the Burgesses into\r\nsubmission and so rule the colony like a despot; no Nicholson could hand\r\nout commissions as sheriffs, or collectors, or officers in the militia\r\nin exchange for votes in the House; no Spotswood could create tobacco\r\nagents' jobs to tempt the people's representatives.\r\n\r\nThough Gooch was solicitous for the welfare of the poor planter, he was\r\nnot in favor of manhood suffrage. So he affixed his signature to a bill\r\nlimiting the right to vote to freeholders owning 100 acres of unoccupied\r\nland or twenty-five acres with a house.[15] Had he had his way the\r\nlimitation would have been greater. \"Yet as the former laws had allowed\r\nany kind of a freehold to give that right, and all attempts made\r\nheretofore to exclude the mob of the populace ... had proved vain, it is\r\nmuch better to have that point fixed on some certain basis, than to\r\nleave all persons indefinitely at liberty to have a vote. ... After such\r\na beginning it may be hoped a further regulation will follow to remove\r\nfrom the House such members as have little recommended them to the\r\npeople's choice besides the art of stirring up discontents.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThough Gooch thus frankly avowed his dislike of democracy, he promoted\r\nits growth by encouraging the westward expansion of settlement, not only\r\nin the Piedmont, but in the Shenandoah Valley. In 1736 he wrote the\r\nLords of Trade: \"Great numbers, as well of his Majesty's natural born\r\nsubjects as foreigners, ... have removed into this colony on the west\r\nside of our mountains.\" This he pointed out would be a protection to the\r\nolder parts of the colony by heading off any attempt of the French at\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it had not occurred to Gooch that expansion would divide the\r\ncolony into two parts--the democratic up-country, and the aristocratic\r\ntidewater. Spotsylvania, Brunswick, Goochland, Amelia, Caroline, and\r\nother counties in the Piedmont were filling up with small farmers from\r\nthe east, Frederick with poor Germans and Swiss. It is true that some\r\nwell-to-do planters established \"quarters\" managed by overseers above\r\nthe Fall Line, and later invaded parts of the Valley, but even as late\r\nas the French and Indian War frontier conditions persisted in the\r\nregions on either side of the Blue Ridge. The influence of the west grew\r\nsteadily as each new county sent its two representatives to the House of\r\nBurgesses. Whereas in 1727 when there were 65 members of the House, only\r\n10 were from the west, in 1752, when the members numbered 104, 46 were\r\nfrom the western or southwestern counties. The time was not distant when\r\nthe up-country members would count a majority. A bewigged Carter, or\r\nHarrison, or Wormeley, in his broadcloth suit with silver buttons, may\r\nhave been resentful when a roughly clad delegate from Albemarle or\r\nFrederick took a seat beside him, but he dared not show it.\r\n\r\nBut in the first test of strength the newcomers lost because the east\r\nstill dominated the Council. In 1749, after the burning of the Capitol\r\nin Williamsburg, the western Burgesses proposed that the seat of\r\ngovernment be moved to a site on the Pamunkey, in Hanover County, which\r\nwould save them many miles of travel in attending meetings of the\r\nAssembly. The feeling on each side ran high. Mr. John Blair, a member of\r\nthe Council, in conversation with one of the Burgesses, pointed to the\r\nSpeaker, saying: \"There goes the man who is at the bottom of this\r\nhellish scheme.\" The House was deeply offended, and was appeased only\r\nwhen Blair apologized. After much hesitation the bill for the removal\r\nwas passed by a vote of forty to thirty-eight, but it was promptly\r\nrejected by the Council.[17] So the Capitol was rebuilt on the old\r\nfoundations, but with the proviso that this would not fix the seat of\r\ngovernment permanently in Williamsburg. It did, however, fix it there\r\nuntil the Revolution, when, in response to the wishes of an overwhelming\r\nmajority of the people, it was moved to Richmond.\r\n\r\nDuring most of Gooch's administration the two Houses worked in harmony.\r\nBut occasionally there was friction. At the close of the session of 1728\r\nthe Burgesses passed a resolution to pay their own salaries out of the\r\nfund raised by the duty on liquors in order to lessen the hated poll\r\ntax. But the Council refused to concur. The Burgesses then voted that\r\nthey be paid from funds in the hands of the Treasurer. Again the Council\r\ndemurred. They argued that the salaries of the Burgesses was the concern\r\nof the counties. \"It would be an unequal distribution of the public\r\nmoney to allow the same share of it to a county which has a thousand\r\ntithables as one that has three thousand.\"[18] This reasoning was based\r\non the assumption that a Burgess represented only the interests of the\r\ncounty which elected him and not those of the colony as a whole, an\r\nassumption contradicted by the whole history of the House. Yet the\r\nBurgesses, though with some bitterness, were forced to yield for the\r\ntime being.\r\n\r\nGooch was much concerned over the dispute, for he was convinced that it\r\nwas not ended. He was right. At the very next session a bill was passed\r\nto pay the Burgesses out of the money in the Treasurer's hands, provided\r\nthis should not reduce the fund below L1,500.[19] The Council consented,\r\nunder Gooch's urging, because the bill allowed the Burgesses only ten\r\nshillings a day instead of thirteen as formerly, and nothing when not\r\nactually in attendance, but \"at home about their private affairs or\r\nperhaps in pursuit of their pleasures.\" Gooch wrote the Lords of Trade\r\ncongratulating himself on having reduced salaries, but this does not\r\nobscure the fact that the act was a victory for the House.[20]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the House of Burgesses, like the House of Commons, was becoming\r\nthe dominating body, and the Council, like the House of Lords, was\r\ngrowing weaker. With the multiplying of the number of wealthy planters\r\nthrough the use of slave labor, the twelve men who made up the Council\r\nceased to be the sole representatives of their interests. Many\r\naristocrats were honored to have a seat in the Lower House. One has only\r\nto glance down the list of Burgesses to find many of the proudest names\r\nin colonial Virginia--Page, Harrison, Fairfax, Randolph, Burwell,\r\nCarter, Ball, Wormeley, Digges, Spotswood, Lee, Byrd, Claiborne, etc. So\r\nthe aristocrat as well as the small farmer, the wealthy easterner as\r\nwell as the pioneer of Orange or Albemarle, or the German of Frederick\r\nlooked to the House to protect their interests.\r\n\r\nWhile the leadership of the House continued to be aristocratic, the rank\r\nand file grew more democratic. The open spaces of America fostered a\r\nspirit of independence. When men had gone into a wilderness, cleared\r\nopenings in the forest, built their simple houses, laid out crops,\r\nfought the Indians, they became impatient of control by a group of\r\neastern aristocrats, or by a government three thousand miles away in\r\nwhich they had no voice.\r\n\r\nNor was democracy confined to the west, for the small farmer class of\r\nthe east persisted despite the importation of thousands of slaves. It is\r\ntrue that many, finding it difficult to compete with slave labor, sold\r\ntheir little holdings, packed up their few household goods, and set out\r\nfor the West or for one of the northern colonies. But others kept their\r\nheads above water by producing only the highest grades of tobacco, for\r\nwhich the blacks at first were not suited. \"I must beg you to remember\r\nthat the common people make the best,\" Gooch wrote in 1731.\r\n\r\nBut this reprieve was only temporary, for in time the wealthy planter\r\ntaught the Africans to produce even the high priced Orinoco. Then the\r\npoor planter had to join the class of slaveholders by making a few\r\npurchases, or sink into abject poverty. That thousands did buy slaves we\r\nknow from an examination of the tax lists. In 1716, in Lancaster County,\r\nof some 200 slave-owners, 165 had from one to four only. The only large\r\nowner was the wealthy Robert Carter who had 126.[21]\r\n\r\nThe replacing of the Virginia yeomanry, the men who cultivated their\r\nholdings with their own hands, by small slaveholders was in many ways a\r\ndevelopment to be deplored, but it saved the small farmer class from\r\nextinction, and democracy from a fatal blow. Without it all the eastern\r\npart of the colony and part of the Piedmont would have become a land of\r\nwealthy proprietors and their slaves, and ignorant, degraded,\r\npoverty-stricken whites.\r\n\r\nThe small slaveholders were fiercely jealous of their rights, both\r\nsocial and political. From the proud aristocrat they demanded courtesy\r\nand respect. And these the aristocrat thought it wise to accord them,\r\nfor he knew that they constituted an overwhelming majority of the\r\nvoters. Nor were there anywhere, in the northern colonies or in the\r\nWest, more ardent upholders of self-government. In the long struggle for\r\nliberty it was usually the aristocrats who led the way, but they would\r\nhave been powerless had they not had the loyal support of the small\r\neastern farmer as well as the western frontiersman.\r\n\r\nAnd the climax of this struggle was not distant. Walpole resigned in\r\n1752, and his successors were not inclined to let the colonies become\r\nsemi-independent little republics. Had their attention not been diverted\r\nby European wars, they would probably have come to grips with the\r\ncolonial governments sooner than they did.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, however, the chief differences between Virginia and the\r\nmother country seemed to be economic rather than constitutional. The\r\nplanters had long protested against the Navigation Acts, but they had in\r\ntime adjusted themselves to them. To the merchants of England they were\r\ntied by the bonds of mutual interest, for they were dependent upon them\r\nfor transporting and disposing of their tobacco, and for bringing them\r\nmanufactured goods in return.\r\n\r\nBut there developed various points of difference. And it became a bitter\r\ngrievance to the planters that when these differences were placed before\r\nthe British government, the decision always favored the merchants. In\r\nfact, so great was the influence of certain traders that at times their\r\nrecommendations to important posts in the colonies were decisive. Among\r\nthe best known of these men was Micajah Perry, whose opinion the Board\r\nof Trade frequently sought on matters affecting commerce. It was rumored\r\nthat it was he who persuaded the Auditor General to appoint Philip\r\nLudwell Auditor of Virginia. And when the British government turned down\r\nthe recommendation of a Governor in filling a vacancy in the Council in\r\nfavor of one by the merchants, it was deeply resented in the colony.\r\n\"Your Lordships cannot but be sensible that little regard is likely to\r\nbe paid a Governor who shall be supposed to have no interest at your\r\nLordships' Board,\" Gooch wrote in 1747.\r\n\r\nThe people were even more resentful at the insistence of the merchants\r\nin blocking any measure by the Assembly, no matter how beneficial, if\r\nthey thought it would lessen their profits. Many of them had invested in\r\nthe Royal African Company, and the slave trade to Virginia was booming.\r\nIt was stated that black workers were coming in at the rate of 1,500 or\r\n1,600 a year, and at every landing place scores were sold to the highest\r\nbidders. In 1730, out of a total population of 114,000, no less than\r\n30,000 were Negroes.[22] With profits piling up, the merchants wanted no\r\ninterference with this trade, however inhuman it was, and however\r\nharmful to the economic and social structure of the colony.\r\n\r\nMany thoughtful men in the colony viewed the situation with alarm, not\r\nonly because the importation of so many blacks was drying up the stream\r\nof white immigrants from England, but because it was driving out of the\r\ncolony poor men who did not want to compete with slave labor. And the\r\nplanters had reason to dread slave insurrections. Some of the Africans\r\nwere docile enough, but a few resented their bonds fiercely. In 1710 a\r\nconspiracy was discovered in Surry and James City Counties, in which the\r\nNegroes planned to rise, kill all who opposed them, and escape out of\r\nthe colony. Several were tried in the General Court, convicted and\r\nexecuted.[23]\r\n\r\nThere was much satisfaction when the Assembly, in the revenue act of\r\n1723, tried to stem the tide by placing a duty on the importation of\r\nslaves. But when the act came before the Lords of Trade, the merchants\r\nopposed it vigorously. John Gary, who had lived in Virginia, and later\r\nwent to England to enter the tobacco trade, when summoned before the\r\nBoard, argued against it. It would ruin the poor planters, he said,\r\nbecause it would run up the cost of slaves, and they would not be able\r\nto buy enough to cultivate their plantations.[24] This argument, as we\r\nhave seen, was not entirely misleading, but it ignored the predicament\r\nof the thousands who could afford not even one, no matter how cheap, and\r\nso sank into great poverty, became \"poor white trash.\" Yet the Board\r\nsided with Cary and his fellow merchants, and in January, 1724, advised\r\nthe King to veto the act.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, greatly disappointed, five years later made another\r\nattempt, placing a duty of forty shillings a head on the importation of\r\nslaves. Gooch gave them his full support. The merchants would not be\r\ninjured by the law, he argued, since the purchasers had to pay the\r\ntax.[25] But the importers did not see it that way, and at their urging\r\nthe King disallowed the act.\r\n\r\nHow bitterly these vetoes were resented in Virginia is shown by a\r\nstatement of Thomas Jefferson in his \"A Summary View of the Rights of\r\nBritish America,\" written in 1774. \"The abolition of slavery is the\r\ngreat object of desire in those colonies, where it was, unhappily,\r\nintroduced in their infant state. But previously to the enfranchisement\r\nof the slaves we have, it is necessary to exclude all further\r\nimportations from Africa. Yet our repeated attempts to effect this, by\r\nprohibitions, and by imposing duties which might amount to a\r\nprohibition, having been hitherto defeated by his Majesty's negative:\r\nthus preferring the immediate advantages of a few British corsairs to\r\nthe lasting interests of the American States, and the rights of human\r\nnature deeply wounded by this infamous practice. Nay, the single\r\ninterposition of an interested individual against a law was scarcely\r\never known to fail of success, though, in the opposite scale, were\r\nplaced the interests of a whole country.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThe merchants opposed, not only the duty on slaves, but any other duty\r\nwhich they thought might lessen imports. The Assembly repeatedly passed\r\nlaws to place duties on rum, brandy, wine, cider, beer, and ale, not\r\nbecause they thought they would debauch the people, but to raise revenue\r\nto meet the needs of the government without resorting to the hated poll\r\ntax. They finally persuaded the merchants that light duties on liquors\r\nwould do them no harm. And perhaps the King was persuaded to give his\r\nassent by the urgings of Gooch. \"The revenue arising from the duty on\r\nliquors is the best expedient to raise money for defraying the\r\ncontingent charges of the government and the chief support of the\r\nCollege of William and Mary,\" he wrote. \"By it most of the public debts\r\nare paid and the people eased of an intolerable poll tax, which many of\r\nthe poorer sort would be unable to pay.\"\r\n\r\nBut in 1730 the Assembly went too far when, in the revenue bill of that\r\nyear, they exempted Virginia owners from half the tax in a rather\r\nforlorn attempt to build up local shipping. The merchants were\r\nindignant. It was a very partial procedure, they thought, for the\r\ncolonists to tax his Majesty's subjects at large to a higher degree than\r\nthemselves. Moreover, it set up the shipping of Virginia in opposition\r\nto and in great prejudice to the navigation of Great Britain. Needless\r\nto say the act was disallowed.[27] It was now the turn of the planters\r\nto be indignant. Gooch wrote the Board: \"I cannot conceal from your\r\nLordships the resentment of the people against the merchants.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe Virginians, like the peoples of the other colonies, were angered at\r\nthe passage of the Molasses Act, which placed prohibitive duties on the\r\ntrade between the British colonies on the American continent and the\r\nforeign West Indies. Virginia's stake in the trade to the French and\r\nSpanish islands was much less than that of New England, but it was great\r\nenough to draw a protest from Gooch. And the good Governor seems to have\r\nwinked at the violations of the act. In 1734 he wrote the Lords of\r\nTrade: \"As to trade, upon the strictest inquiry I can make I can find\r\nnone ... but with Great Britain, the British islands in the West Indies,\r\nand the island of Madeira.\"[29] The Board might well have asked why it\r\nwas, if this were true, that so many Spanish pieces of eight and so many\r\npistoles and French guineas and crowns were circulating in the colony.\r\n\r\nEven more serious than the conflict between planters and merchants over\r\nthe restrictions of trade, was the quarrel over debts. The trade with\r\nGreat Britain was carried on chiefly by credit, and in times when the\r\nprice of tobacco was high and profits good the planters lived well and\r\nspent freely. Then it was that they made heavy purchases of silverware,\r\nhandsome furniture, or even blooded horses. And only too often, when\r\nprices of tobacco fell, they could not bring themselves to curtail\r\nexpenditures in proportion. In fact, when they placed their orders they\r\ncould not foresee just what their year's crop would yield. Many of them\r\nbecame involved in debt. When they could not meet their obligations, the\r\nmerchants demanded that their lands be forfeited. On the other hand, the\r\nplanters, from time to time, tried to lessen the burden by paying their\r\ncreditors in depreciated paper money.\r\n\r\nWhen the merchants appealed to the Virginia courts to force payment of\r\ndebts they found them usually sympathetic with the debtors. Moreover, in\r\nmost cases they could not appeal to the British courts for there was a\r\nlaw forbidding it in cases involving less than L300. For larger suits\r\nthe shoe was on the other foot, for when they were taken before the\r\nPrivy Council, the advantage was all with the merchants. Residing in\r\nGreat Britain, most of them in London, they could appeal in person to\r\npresent their cause. Since the prosperity of the kingdom was so\r\ndependent upon its commerce, they always received a sympathetic hearing.\r\n\r\nTypical was the suit of the executors of Micajah and Richard Perry to\r\nrecover debts from the estate of Colonel William Randolph, who had had a\r\nlong-standing account with them. When the Virginia courts decided in\r\nfavor of the defendants, the executors of the Perrys appealed to the\r\nKing. The Privy Council referred the matter to a commission of four\r\nmerchants, three of whom gave it as their judgment that with compound\r\ninterest and insurance charges the defendants owed L2,460. So the\r\nverdict of the Virginia court was reversed.\r\n\r\nThe Council and Burgesses protested in an address to the King. They were\r\nalarmed that this case had been decided without a legal trial by jury,\r\nthey said. It had never been the practice to charge \"interest upon\r\ninterest\" in \"open running accounts.\" They thought it wrong that \"the\r\nreports of merchants\" who were not under oath and were inclined to favor\r\none another, should be permitted to overrule the verdict of legal\r\njuries. If the planters were to be loaded with whatever charges their\r\nfactors thought fit, it would greatly discourage trade and industry.[30]\r\n\r\nBut they were unprepared for the extreme lengths to which the merchants\r\nwould go. At a meeting of the Council in October, 1731, they could\r\nhardly credit their ears when Gooch read them a letter stating that they\r\nwere about to present a petition to Parliament concerning the colonies.\r\nThey wanted first a law prohibiting the Assemblies from passing any\r\nacts affecting trade and navigation, second, a law making real estate\r\nliable for debts, and third, a law permitting appeals from the Virginia\r\nGeneral Court to the Privy Council in suits involving L100 or more.[31]\r\n\r\nGooch wrote at once to the Board denouncing this attempt to muzzle the\r\nAssembly. \"When I considered, my Lords, how long and happily the British\r\nsubjects have traded to America and acquired great riches under the\r\nancient establishment made in these points by the Crown, set forth in\r\nthe royal charters and instructions, without seeking to abridge the\r\npeople of the plantations of their birthright as Englishmen, or limiting\r\nthe Crown in the methods of government, I must confess I was somewhat\r\nstartled.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThe Council also protested vigorously. It was impossible for the\r\nAssembly to avoid all legislation affecting trade, they said in a letter\r\nto the Board, since it might prohibit certain vitally necessary laws. If\r\nthe merchants objected to any act of Assembly, they could lay the matter\r\nbefore the King. As for making the land of the planters liable for\r\ndebts, it was pointed out that there was no law making the lands of the\r\nmerchants liable to the demands of the colonists. Yet the factors were\r\nas often in the planters' debt as the planters in theirs. It would\r\ncreate uneasiness in the minds of a loyal people to find they had not\r\nequal justice. And to allow appeals to the King in cases involving as\r\nlittle as L100 would be a heavy burden; for the expense of the planter,\r\nwho would have to make a voyage to England to defend his rights, would\r\nbe as great as the sum involved.[33]\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt to anticipate any action to forbid legislation in the\r\ncolony affecting trade that a clause was added to certain acts\r\nsuspending their operation until the King had given his assent. During\r\nGooch's administration the first such act appropriated L1,000 for the\r\nerection of a lighthouse of brick and stone on Cape Henry, provided\r\nMaryland appropriate a like amount and the King gave his assent. A duty\r\nof one penny a ton was to be levied on all vessels passing the light.\r\nGooch urged the Lords of Trade to influence Lord Baltimore to recommend\r\nthe matter to the Maryland Assembly. But he was treading on dangerous\r\nground when he suggested that if the Marylanders balked, the Board\r\nsecure an act of Parliament \"to bind both governments to do that good to\r\nthemselves and the trade of Great Britain.\"[34] Fortunately the Board\r\nrefused to take such a drastic step, and it was only in 1772 that the\r\nlighthouse was erected.[35]\r\n\r\nKnowing that the King had vetoed the tobacco act of 1713, Gooch took\r\npains to prepare the minds of the Board of Trade to consider favorably\r\nthe new one he was contemplating. The government was being defrauded by\r\nrunning tobacco into Great Britain without paying the duty there, he\r\nwrote them. It was the practice for sailors to buy \"mean and trash\r\ntobacco,\" and sell it to agents who knew how to dispose of it. \"Thus is\r\nthe market for the good tobacco damped by the fraudulent importation of\r\nthe bad.\" The remedy was to bring all the tobacco under strict\r\ninspection by sworn officers, all the bad destroyed, and the weight of\r\nevery hogshead reported to the commissioners of the customs.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco act of 1730 provided for warehouses to which all tobacco\r\nmust be brought in hogsheads for inspection, where it would be burnt if\r\nof low grade, or stamped if good, and the owner paid in notes which\r\ncirculated as money. At the time the price of tobacco was low, and the\r\nplanters, especially the small farmers, were in dire need. Gooch\r\ncontended that the law would stimulate trade and bring relief.\r\n\r\nHis arguments were set forth in a printed pamphlet entitled _A Dialogue\r\nbetween Thomas Sweet-scented, William Orinoco, Planters, both Men of\r\nGood Understanding, and Justice Love-Country_.\r\n\r\nWill opened the discussion: \"I am sure I have heard a great many\r\nspeeches against it at the race-grounds and at the county courts....\r\nWhy, pray is it not a clear case, don't we see our tobacco burnt?...\r\nT'was constantly buzzed about as if by this law the rich intended to\r\nruin the poor.\"\r\n\r\nJustice: \"None but the worst villains could suggest such a reflection.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the arguments went, with Justice answering every objection.\r\n\r\nGooch claimed that the law in operation benefited the poor. It was the\r\nrich man with his slave labor who was responsible for most of the\r\n\"trash\" which the inspectors burnt. The small farmer who planted,\r\ntended, and cured his own tobacco produced the best.[36] In fact, he\r\nadded, \"the greatest encouragement is given to the common people to make\r\ntobacco that could be thought of, for ... they take as many notes for it\r\nas they please, i. e. notes for fifty or a hundred pounds ... [which]\r\nwill be accepted as payment at any store or shop.\" In other words, it\r\ngave them a far more convenient currency than their bulky tobacco. More\r\nconvincing to the small farmer than these arguments was the rise in the\r\nprice of tobacco which followed the passage of the act. But it must have\r\nbeen obvious to thoughtful men that no regulation of the tobacco trade\r\ncould better the condition of the poor man so long as he had to compete\r\nwith slave labor. It was slavery which created a trash far more harmful\r\nthan poor tobacco--poor white trash.\r\n\r\nGooch's success in securing the King's assent to the tobacco law was\r\nmatched by his success in persuading the Assembly to assist with men and\r\nmoney in an expedition against New Granada on the northern coast of\r\nSouth America. In May, 1740, an act was passed to impress men, and in a\r\nfew weeks about four hundred had been raised. A ragged, motley crowd\r\nthey must have been, for no one was taken who had any lawful occupation\r\nor who had a right to vote.[37] But the officers were from the best\r\nVirginia families, among them Lawrence Washington, half-brother of\r\nGeorge Washington. Later the Assembly voted L5,000 to cover the cost of\r\nfeeding and transporting the troops as far as Jamaica, where they were\r\nto join the forces sent out from England.\r\n\r\nFormer Governor Spotswood had been appointed to lead the colonials, but\r\nwhen he died before the ships sailed, Governor Gooch, leaving the\r\ngovernment in the hands of the senior Councillor, Commissary Blair, took\r\nover the command. The attack on Cartagena proved a failure. The British\r\nships could not get near enough to shell the town. When the troops tried\r\nto storm the walls the ladders proved too short, and they were repulsed\r\nwith heavy losses. Gooch himself was wounded.\r\n\r\nGooch was knighted in 1746, and made a major general in the British\r\narmy. He seems never to have recovered fully from his wound, and from\r\nan illness contracted during the New Granada campaign. Complaining that\r\nhe had grown old and infirm, he asked the King for permission to \"go\r\nhome\" to recover his health. To the universal regret of the people of\r\nVirginia, he left for England in the summer of 1749. He died December\r\n17, in London.\r\n\r\nGooch himself gave the key to his administration when he wrote: \"The\r\ncondition of affairs in this colony may be summed up in two words, peace\r\nand plenty.\" With many families becoming rich through the settlement of\r\nthe West and the growth of the tobacco trade, with many hundreds of\r\nsmall farmers acquiring a degree of well-being by the purchase of a few\r\nslaves, with no immediate threat from the Indians on the frontier, with\r\nGovernor and Council maintaining cordial relations, with the Governor\r\ncooperating with the Assembly and not trying to dominate it, with rapid\r\nstrides being made toward the goal of self-government, the years of\r\nGooch's administration may aptly be termed the golden era of Virginia\r\ncolonial history.\r\n\r\nMany of the addresses of various bodies to the Virginia Governors lack\r\nthe ring of sincerity, because they were obtained by bribery or threats.\r\nBut the Council, in 1736, seem to have spoken from their hearts when\r\nthey told Gooch: \"As for us, Sir, who have the honor to be the near\r\nwitnesses of the prudence, moderation, and justice of your\r\nadministration, we should be unjust to ourselves, as well as ungrateful\r\nto your character, if we ... did not declare that we esteem the quiet\r\nand tranquillity which this colony has enjoyed under your government as\r\none of the greatest public blessings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were even more articulate: \"We are very sensible how much\r\nthe colony owes to your good conduct in the government, and that all\r\nyour actions are directed to a faithful discharge of your duty to his\r\nMajesty and to promote our common good. And should we distrust so just\r\nand upright a magistrate it would be discountenancing a virtuous\r\nadministration, and making no difference between that and the greatest\r\nenormities, tyranny, and oppression. Or should we withhold our\r\nconfidence from a person who for so many years has never once abused it,\r\nwe might justly be reckoned an unworthy representative of a grateful\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Leonidas Dodson, _Alexander Spotswood_, 270, 271.\r\n\r\n[2] _Sainsbury transcripts_ 9: 74, 75.\r\n\r\n[3] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1712-1726: 402.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._, 419.\r\n\r\n[5] _Sainsbury transcripts_, 9: 121.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._, 134.\r\n\r\n[7] _Ibid._, xlix, 1.\r\n\r\n[8] _Executive journals of the Council_ 4: 40.\r\n\r\n[9] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1712-1726: 1.\r\n\r\n[10] _Executive journals of the Council_ 4: 114.\r\n\r\n[11] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1727-1740: 242.\r\n\r\n[12] Gooch to the Lords of Trade, Feb. 12, 1728; Aug. 9, 1728.\r\n\r\n[13] W.

Hastening on to\r\nWilliamsburg, he was met on the road by Commissary William Dawson, John\r\nBlair, and Philip Ludwell. When the little cavalcade reached the\r\noutskirts of the town, they found the Mayor, Aldermen, and other\r\nprominent citizens waiting to welcome them. At the Palace, Dinwiddie\r\ntook the oath of office. He and the members of the Council then went to\r\nWetherburn's tavern for dinner, where they were guests of the town. As\r\nthe cannons at the powder horn roared their approval, they lifted their\r\nglasses to drink the \"royal healths.\"\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of Dinwiddie brought to an end the custom of appointing\r\nmilitary officers as Governors or Lieutenant Governors of the colony.\r\nNicholson, Andros, Spotswood, Hunter, Drysdale, and Gooch had all been\r\nsoldiers. One wonders why the policy had persisted so long, for there\r\nwould seem to be little in the training of an army officer to fit him\r\nfor the duties of a colonial administrator. The habit of issuing\r\ncommands and expecting instant obedience might easily cause failure in\r\ndealing with a liberty-loving people. Yet in practice, it seems to have\r\nbeen the personal character of the Governor, rather than his training,\r\nwhich determined his conduct. Nicholson and Spotswood were by nature\r\ndictators, Drysdale and Gooch had no desire for power for power's sake.\r\n\r\nYet the Virginians were no doubt pleased with the appointment of a man\r\nfrom civil life. Dinwiddie came from a family of Glasgow merchants, and\r\nas a young man had been engaged in the pottery business. At the age of\r\ntwenty-eight he was made Collector of Customs in Bermuda, in which\r\noffice he won the approval of the Lords of Trade by uncovering serious\r\nfrauds in the collecting of customs in the West Indies. In 1738 he was\r\nadvanced to the important post of Surveyor General of the southern ports\r\nof the North American continent. Additional responsibilities were\r\nplaced upon him a few years later, when he was made Inspector General of\r\nthe Customs. In 1749 he resigned this office, probably in order to\r\nengage in trade.\r\n\r\nThe painting of Dinwiddie in the National Portrait Gallery, London,\r\nshows a rather stout, middle-aged man. The face which looks out from\r\nbeneath a large wig, despite the placid expression, shows strength in\r\nthe lines of the mouth and the steady gaze of the eyes. Dinwiddie,\r\nthroughout his career did not willingly provoke a conflict, but when the\r\nconflict was started he fought stubbornly. Yet when necessity dictated\r\nhe knew how to yield. The first of these qualities made him an important\r\nfactor in preserving the most important part of North America for\r\nBritish civilization. The other contributed greatly to the triumph of\r\nself-government in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe new Lieutenant Governor's administration began auspiciously. In his\r\nopening address to the Assembly he expressed his pleasure at being in\r\nVirginia, where he had so many friends. He realized it would be\r\ndifficult to equal the record of his predecessor, but he hoped, with the\r\nadvice of the Council and the Burgesses, to serve the colony well. One\r\nwonders whether he had in mind some of the former Governors of Virginia\r\nwhen he pointed out that indolence, avarice, and ambition were\r\nresponsible for many public calamities.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of good will to the Governor ripened into gratitude when he\r\nsided with the Assembly in their protest against an action of the King\r\nin Council. This was almost unprecedented, for a Governor was supposed\r\nto defend anything the royal government did, no matter how harmful to\r\nthe colony or unjust.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Assembly, in 1748 and 1749, had made a laborious\r\nrevision of the laws. The completed work, in sixty-seven acts, they sent\r\nto the King so that he could review them. But it was not anticipated\r\nthat he would either veto or sign any of them. So there was\r\nconsternation when Dinwiddie reported that the King in Council had\r\nsigned fifty-seven of the revised laws and vetoed ten. Of the latter,\r\ntwo--one declaring slaves personal property and the other setting up the\r\nGeneral Court--were of great importance. Each House drew up an address\r\nto the King pleading with him to reconsider his action. When Dinwiddie\r\npromised to endorse and deliver them, Councillors and Burgesses alike\r\nwere grateful. Before dispersing they voted him a gift of L500, which\r\nDinwiddie, despite his instructions seems to have accepted.[1]\r\n\r\nBut the honeymoon was of short duration. Before Dinwiddie left England\r\nhe was entrusted with a new seal for Virginia. It was this, no doubt,\r\nwhich gave him the idea of adding to his income by charging a pistole\r\nfor signing patents for land and affixing the seal. Had he been aware of\r\nthe storm raised by the similar attempt by Lord Effingham sixty-four\r\nyears earlier, he would have known what was in store for him. The\r\nCouncil, too, seem to have been forgetful in this matter, for when the\r\nGovernor asked their opinion, they advised him to go ahead.[2]\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly met in November, 1753, Dinwiddie told them that a\r\nlarge body of French regulars, accompanied by Indian allies, had marched\r\ndown from Canada into the Ohio region and had built a fort there. The\r\nKing had commanded him to lay before them a request for funds to defeat\r\ntheir designs, and to purchase gifts for the friendly Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were fully aware of the danger. For the French to build a\r\nchain of forts on the Monongahela and the Ohio to connect with those on\r\nthe Mississippi would make a barrier to further expansion of the English\r\ncolonies to the west. It would also constitute an ever present threat to\r\ntheir frontier, since in future wars the way would be open to forays of\r\nhostile Indians. Such men as Joshua Fry, Edmund Pendleton, John\r\nRobinson, and Benjamin Harrison may have realized that the fate of\r\nVirginia and of all English North America hung in the balance.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment the Burgesses were more interested in preserving\r\ntheir liberty than their safety. They began by considering the\r\ncomplaints of several counties against the pistole fee. Dinwiddie\r\naccused the Reverend William Stith, President of the College of William\r\nand Mary, of inciting the people against the fee. Stith was his personal\r\nenemy, he thought, because he had opposed his appointment as Commissary\r\nof the clergy.[3] So he wrote to the Bishop of London suggesting that if\r\nhe would advise Stith \"to be peaceable and quiet and teach the doctrine\r\nof love,\" it would make him more easy in his government.[4] If it was\r\nStith who aroused the people against the pistole fee, he made a good\r\njob of it. Henrico County protested, Chesterfield protested, Albemarle\r\nprotested, Cumberland, Amelia, Dinwiddie Counties protested.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Governor Dinwiddie. Portrait in the National Portrait\r\n    Gallery of London. Reproduced by permission.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The General Court in the Old Capitol at Williamsburg.\r\n    Courtesy of Colonial Williamsburg, Inc.]\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were deeply concerned. In an address to the Lieutenant\r\nGovernor they declared that their duty in the discharge of the trust\r\nreposed in them by the people required them to ask him by what authority\r\nhe demanded the fee. He replied that he had acted on his own authority,\r\nwith the advice of the Council. And he intimated that the taking of the\r\nfee was a thing that did not concern them.\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were indignant. In an address of historic significance\r\nthey told Dinwiddie \"in the strongest terms\" that it was their undoubted\r\nright to enquire into the grievances of the people. To question it was\r\nto threaten the liberties of his Majesty's subjects and the constitution\r\nof the government. \"The rights of the subject are so secured by law that\r\nthey cannot be deprived of the least part of their property but by their\r\nown consent. Upon this excellent principle is our constitution founded,\r\nand ever since this colony has had the happiness of being under the\r\nimmediate protection of the Crown the royal declarations have been:\r\n'That no man's life, member, freehold, or goods be taken away or harmed\r\nbut by established and known laws.'\"[5]\r\n\r\nWell would it have been if the King and his advisers had pondered well\r\nthis declaration when it came before them, for it gave in unmistakable\r\nlanguage the principle in defense of which the American Revolution was\r\nfought. And it would have been well for Dinwiddie had he bowed to the\r\nwishes of the Burgesses at a time when their cooperation was needed to\r\nsave the British colonies from French aggression.\r\n\r\nBut in the meanwhile he had placed the matter before the Board of Trade,\r\nand the Board had asked the opinion of Attorney General Sir Dudley\r\nRyder.[6] When Dinwiddie received word that Sir Dudley thought the\r\nassent of the Assembly unnecessary, he was resolved not to yield. The\r\nfee relates solely to the disposal of the King's lands, he told the\r\nBurgesses, which is a matter of favor from the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Governor's plea that the fee was necessary in order to bring\r\nthousands of occupied, but unpatented acres, under the rent roll seems\r\nto have been an afterthought. \"On my arrival I found in the Secretary's\r\noffice a list of lands taken up near 1,000,000 acres, which, most of\r\nthem, should have been patented,\" he wrote the Board of Trade, \"which is\r\nan annual loss to the quit rents.\"[7] But he did not explain how the\r\ncharging of a pistole fee would have been an incentive to the holders of\r\nthese lands to have them patented.\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were by this time thoroughly aroused. The Governor said it\r\nwas only \"some hotheaded young men\" who had stirred up all the trouble,\r\nbut when it was resolved that his answer was unsatisfactory, there was\r\nnot one dissenting voice. The demand for the fee, they insisted, was\r\nillegal and arbitrary, contrary to the charters of the colony, to King\r\nWilliam's express order, and tending to the subversion of laws and\r\nconstitution. They were determined to place the matter before the King\r\nin a \"dutiful and loyal address.\"[8]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the session, after the Governor's speech proroguing\r\nthem, the Burgesses refused to budge from their seats until they had\r\npassed still another resolution which breathed the spirit of revolution:\r\n\"That whoever shall hereafter pay a pistole as a fee to the Governor for\r\nthe use of the seal to patents for land shall be deemed a betrayer of\r\nthe rights and privileges of the people.\" This Dinwiddie thought tended\r\nto \"sowing sedition and rebellion among the people.\"[9]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Burgesses had drawn up the address to the King and\r\nappointed Attorney General Peyton Randolph their agent to take it to\r\nEngland. To defray his expenses and pay him for his services, they voted\r\nhim L2,500 out of the funds in the hands of the Treasurer. When this\r\ncame before the Council, they rejected it. The Treasurer then declared\r\nthat he would pay the money without their consent, but he refrained when\r\nthe Governor told him it would not be allowed in his accounts.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to find them very much in a republican way of thinking,\"\r\nDinwiddie wrote to the Earl of Halifax, \"and indeed they do not act in a\r\nproper constitutional way, but making encroachments on the prerogative\r\nof the Crown, which some former Governor submitted too much to them, and\r\nI fear without a very particular instruction it will be difficult to\r\nbring them in order.\"[10]\r\n\r\nWhen Randolph asked Dinwiddie for permission to go to England, he met\r\nwith a prompt refusal. \"You have not acted agreeable to your duty and\r\nyour office,\" he told him. When Randolph insisted upon going, the\r\nGovernor assumed that he had vacated his office and appointed George\r\nWythe Attorney General in his place.[11]\r\n\r\nSoon after Randolph's arrival in England articles began to appear in the\r\ngazettes intended to arouse sentiment against the pistole fee, which\r\nDinwiddie wrongly attributed to him. The fee was no less than a tax\r\nlevied on the people without their consent, they said. Foreign\r\nProtestants and others were leaving the colony rather than pay it. To\r\nthis Dinwiddie replied that any thinking man could distinguish between a\r\nfee and a tax. And he denied flatly that one person had left Virginia to\r\navoid the pistole fee.[12] But he was sorry that the affair had made so\r\nmuch noise in the English coffee houses.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade considered the pistole dispute most inopportune. At a\r\ntime when the French were challenging the right of Great Britain to the\r\nvast trans-Allegheny region, it was unfortunate that the Governor should\r\nhave aroused the bitter resentment of the Assembly. \"It is necessary\r\nthat harmony and mutual confidence be established between the Governors\r\nand people in all the colonies,\" they wrote, \"but especially in\r\nVirginia, on the frontier of which the French are carrying on their\r\nencroachments.\"[13]\r\n\r\nBut they could not desert Dinwiddie entirely since the issue involved\r\nthe royal prerogative. The King rejected the address of the Burgesses,\r\nand the Board confirmed the Governor's right to the fee. But they hedged\r\nit about with several restrictions. There must be no fee for grants of\r\nless than one hundred acres, or for lands granted for importing\r\nsettlers, or for lands west of the mountains. They reproved Dinwiddie\r\nfor proposing that the fee be established by act of Assembly, in\r\nviolation of the King's rights. The making out of surveys for land and\r\nneglecting to pass patents was clearly \"in the Governor's power to\r\nprevent.\" \"We expect you to do your duty ... even though no pecuniary\r\nadvantage should arise from it.\" And they recommended that he reinstate\r\nRandolph as Attorney General. \"This may quiet the minds of the people\r\nand stop this unjust clamor.\"[14]\r\n\r\nDinwiddie was far from happy about this report. The proposal to\r\nestablish the fee by act of Assembly had come from the Council, not from\r\nhim, he wrote in reply. As for not taking a fee for patents west of the\r\nmountains, he wanted to know which mountains. He had taken no fee for\r\nlands beyond the Alleghenies. The suggestion to reinstate the Attorney\r\nGeneral was especially displeasing. However, when Randolph arrived at\r\nWilliamsburg with many letters of recommendation from men of influence\r\nin England, denying that he had written the attacks on the Governor in\r\nthe press, and promising \"to conduct himself more regularly in future\r\nand with more regard to his Majesty's service,\" he reinstated him.[15]\r\n\r\nOne wonders just how many pistoles Dinwiddie pocketed for the use of the\r\nseal in the six and a half years of his administration. A few months\r\nafter he had left Virginia for good there were no less than 1,360\r\napplications for patents waiting to be sealed. Governor Fauquier,\r\nDinwiddie's successor, stated that this was costing the Crown L1,000 a\r\nyear in quit rents. It would seem to indicate that Dinwiddie, ignoring\r\nthe positive orders of the Board of Trade, had appeased the people by\r\npermitting 1,000,000 acres of occupied land to remain unpatented. Thus\r\nthe Governor's victory was a hollow one, and the Burgesses, without\r\nacquiescing in the decision of the Board, were content to let the matter\r\ndrop so long as the fee was not collected.\r\n\r\nFauquier, on his part, handled this hot potato with care. \"Being\r\nextremely desirous to keep peace and harmony in this country,\" he wrote\r\nthe Lords of Trade, \"and that his Majesty's revenue should not suffer\r\n... I have made a declaration in Council that I would be willing to\r\nacquiesce in anything that should be thought reasonable to procure both\r\nthese advantages. This affair has formerly raised a great flame in this\r\ncountry which is not yet quite subsided, and ... I am endeavoring to\r\nquench it entirely that the Assemblies may the easier be prevailed upon\r\nto give what is necessary.\"[16]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the storm of war had broken over the colonies. A\r\nterrible war it was. It lacked the wholesale devastation of the atomic\r\nbomb and the hydrogen bomb, but it was marked by infinite cruelties.\r\nDinwiddie described it vividly. \"Think you see the infant torn from the\r\nunavailing struggles of the distracted mother, the daughters ravished\r\nbefore the eyes of their wretched parents, and then, with cruelty and\r\ninsult, butchered and scalped. Suppose the horrid scene completed, and\r\nthe whole family, man, wife, and children murdered and scalped by these\r\nrelentless savages, and then torn in pieces.\"[17]\r\n\r\nTo Dinwiddie goes the credit of warning the British government that the\r\nFrench were trying to confine the English to the region east of the\r\nAlleghenies. In December, 1752, he wrote the Board of Trade that they\r\nhad built a string of forts from Canada to the mouth of the Mississippi,\r\nthat they had 5,000 soldiers at New Orleans, and 1,600 elsewhere in\r\nAmerica. When he heard that a force of French and Indians had built a\r\nfort on the Allegheny River, and were preparing to descend on the Ohio,\r\nhe sent young George Washington to warn them to leave. This proving\r\nineffectual, he came to the Assembly for funds to finance an expedition\r\nto drive them out.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of a series of appeals for money which gave the\r\nAssembly a golden opportunity to weaken the power of the Governor and\r\nthe royal prerogative. Yet it was an opportunity full of danger. If they\r\nclogged their grants with such conditions that Dinwiddie would not\r\naccept them, they ran the risk of having the colony overrun by the\r\nenemy. At times the Governor was in despair. \"The French could have cut\r\noff every one of our men and marched down to Hampton without the least\r\ndanger,\" he wrote in July, 1754.\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly met in February, 1754, Dinwiddie told them that\r\nWashington had seen a large body of the enemy on the upper Allegheny.\r\nGive me men and supplies to oppose them, he pleaded. The safety of\r\nVirginia depends on you at this critical juncture.[18] In reply to this\r\nappeal they did vote L10,000 but Dinwiddie was far from happy about it\r\nbecause the bill named a committee of the two Houses to supervise its\r\nexpenditure. \"This bill takes from me the undoubted right I have of\r\ndirecting the application of the money,\" he complained. But since funds\r\ncould be had on no other terms he gave his assent. \"I assure you it was\r\ncontrary to my inclination, but necessity has no law,\" he wrote James\r\nAbercrombie.[19]\r\n\r\nSo men were raised and equipped and sent out to the junction of the\r\nAllegheny and the Monongahela. Here, under the command of George\r\nWashington, they were fortifying themselves when they were attacked by\r\nthe French and Indians and forced to retire. Again Dinwiddie pleaded for\r\na grant large enough to meet the emergency. When the Assembly responded\r\nby voting L20,000, he was delighted until he discovered a rider to pay\r\nPeyton Randolph the L2,500 they had promised him for representing them\r\nin England in the pistole affair. This was too much for Dinwiddie to\r\nswallow, so he vetoed the bill.[20]\r\n\r\nIn his perplexity the Governor now made a radical suggestion to the\r\nBoard of Trade. \"I think it impossible to conduct any expedition in\r\nthese parts with a dependence on the Assemblies for supplies, without a\r\nBritish act of Parliament to lay a poll tax on the whole subjects of\r\nthese provinces, to bring them to a sense of their duty to the King, to\r\nawaken them from their insolence, to take care of their lives and\r\nfortunes.\"[21]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine the storm of indignation this would have raised in\r\nVirginia had the people known of it. Why, no such thing had been done in\r\nthe century and a half of the colony's existence. Charles I had not\r\ndared tax the colonists without their consent; Charles II, though he\r\nobtained a revenue in Virginia by threatening the Assembly, had not\r\nacted without their consent. Over and over the people had sought\r\nguarantees that they should enjoy the inherent right of all Englishmen\r\nof being taxed only by their own representatives.\r\n\r\nDinwiddie's suggestion undoubtedly reflected the changed attitude of the\r\nBritish government. He would hardly have dared make it if he had thought\r\nit would shock the British Ministry. On the other hand, the violent\r\nreaction of the people of the colony to the pistole fee should have made\r\nit clear to him that they would resist taxation by Parliament fiercely.\r\nIn other words, his action was revealing of how far apart Britain and\r\nher colonies had grown, and prophetic of the clash that was to come.\r\n\r\nBut now Dinwiddie was cheered by word that the King had promised\r\nL20,000 and 2,000 stand of arms from the royal stores to aid in the war.\r\nWith this evidence that Great Britain was willing to do her part, he\r\nagain appealed to the Assembly. He was overjoyed when they granted\r\nL20,000. \"I parted with the Assembly on good terms. I shall try to keep\r\nthem in good humor,\" he wrote the Board. When he heard that two\r\nregiments of British regulars were on their way to Virginia, he\r\nconfidently expected that the French would soon be driven from the Ohio\r\nregion. All Virginia was elated when the troops arrived at Alexandria in\r\ntheir brilliant red coats. The Assembly voted an additional L22,000.\r\n\r\nThen came disaster. General Braddock, who commanded the British, knew\r\nnothing about Indian fighting, and scorned the advice of those who did.\r\n\"These savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American\r\nmilitia, but upon the King's regular and disciplined troops, sir, it is\r\nimpossible that they should make any impression,\" he told Benjamin\r\nFranklin. So his advanced regiment, as it was filing through the woods,\r\nwas attacked and cut to pieces. The Virginia contingent fought bravely,\r\nbut could not stem the tide. Braddock himself was killed. Colonel\r\nDunbar, in command of the other regiment, though his men had taken no\r\npart in the battle and still outnumbered the enemy, marched them off to\r\nPhiladelphia, and left the Virginia frontier open.\r\n\r\nThe dismay of the people when the news of this unexpected defeat reached\r\nthem was tempered by their pride in the heroism of the Virginia troops,\r\n\"who purchased with their lives immortal glory to their country and\r\nthemselves on the banks of the Monongahela.\" So when Dinwiddie asked for\r\nmore funds, the Assembly voted L40,000.[22] To raise this sum they\r\nlevied heavy taxes on the people and placed a five per cent duty on\r\nimports. In times of peace no Governor would have consented to an import\r\nduty on British goods, for it would have brought immediate protests from\r\nthe merchants. But Dinwiddie signed the bill and praised the Assembly\r\nfor its \"unanimity\" and \"martial spirit.\"[23]\r\n\r\nWhen they met again in October, 1755, they forgot for the moment the\r\nIndian terror and spent their time on a project to emit L200,000 in\r\npaper and set up a loan office. To this the Governor would not assent,\r\nand after a session of only twelve days, he dissolved them to take his\r\nchances on a new election. The Board of Trade praised him. \"Their\r\navailing themselves of this time of danger and distress to establish a\r\npaper currency, so destructive of credit, justifies your dissolving\r\nthem.\"[24]\r\n\r\nDinwiddie was now so out of patience that he suggested once more that\r\nParliament pass the Assembly by and itself levy a tax on the people of\r\nthe colonies. He recommended a poll tax of twelve pence for two years,\r\nand a permanent tax of two shillings on every one hundred acres of land.\r\n\"I know our people will be inflamed if they hear of my making this\r\nproposal, as they are averse to all taxes,\" he wrote the Board of\r\nTrade.[25] One wonders what the Americans would have done had the\r\nBritish Government followed this suggestion. It might have alienated\r\ntheir affection at the very moment when it was most needed. It would\r\nprobably have been as impossible to collect the taxes as it was to\r\nenforce the Stamp Act a decade later. Fortunately, the Board of Trade\r\ndecided that this was not the proper time to start a controversy with\r\nthe colonies over this vital matter.\r\n\r\nThe new House of Burgesses who met in March, 1756, while showing a\r\nwillingness to support the war, were just as independent, just as\r\njealous of their privileges as former ones. When some of their members\r\nwere absent from their seats while attending the General Court, they\r\nsent their mace-bearer within the bar to bring them back. This Dinwiddie\r\nresented as an indignity to the court. The orderly administration of\r\njustice was just as important as the enacting of laws, he told the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nTheir audacity was shown at the same session in the matter of the\r\nAcadian exiles. Governor Charles Lawrence, of Nova Scotia, on the advice\r\nof his Council, had decided to distribute these unfortunates throughout\r\nthe British colonies. When the people of Virginia heard that a fleet\r\nwith over eleven hundred had arrived in their waters, they were deeply\r\nconcerned. No Governor had a right to unload on them such a number of\r\nFrench Roman Catholics, they said. Their remaining in the colony at a\r\ntime when Great Britain and France were at war would be very dangerous.\r\nSo they passed a bill, to which the Governor assented, to ship the\r\nexiles to Great Britain.[26]\r\n\r\nBut while the Assembly was sitting, the Indians were making a series of\r\nmurderous raids in the Valley of Virginia. Washington, who was left in\r\ncommand of the Virginia forces after Dunbar withdrew, wrote Dinwiddie in\r\nApril, 1756, to describe the plight of the people. \"I see their\r\nsituation, know their danger, and participate in their sufferings,\r\nwithout having it in my power to give them further relief than uncertain\r\npromises.... The supplicating tears of the women, and moving petitions\r\nfrom the men melt me into such deadly sorrow that I solemnly declare ...\r\nI could offer myself a willing sacrifice to the butchering enemy\r\nprovided that would contribute to the people's ease.\"[27]\r\n\r\nNor were the Burgesses deaf to the sufferings of these poor people.\r\nAlthough the burden of taxation was very heavy, they voted L60,000 for\r\nthe erection of forts and the sending of the militia into the Valley.\r\nPart of this sum they provided for by the emission of treasury notes.\r\n\"In the situation I was obliged to give my assent or disband our forces\r\nand leave our frontier unguarded and exposed to the incursions of a\r\nmerciless foe,\" Dinwiddie wrote the Board of Trade. But he assured them\r\nthat the merchants would not be losers since the notes bore interest at\r\nfive per cent, and would be redeemed in 1760. Virginia had voted in all\r\nL150,000 for the war, he pointed out, which was much more than any other\r\ncolony had done.[28]\r\n\r\nAt a short session in September, 1756, Dinwiddie told the Assembly of\r\nthe surrender of Oswego. All realized that it was a crushing blow, since\r\nit cut off the English from the Great Lakes, made a deep impression on\r\nthe Indians, and opened New York to invasion. When the Governor asked\r\nfor men and money as Virginia's contribution to the Royal American\r\nRegiment, which the Earl of Loudoun, Commander-in-Chief of the British\r\nforces, was recruiting, they voted L8,000. This the Earl promised to\r\nreport to the British government \"in the very handsome manner\" it\r\ndeserved.[29]\r\n\r\nBut when they met in April, 1757, they did not permit this compliment to\r\nkeep them from taking issue with Loudoun for laying an embargo on\r\ncommerce in order to put an end to the sending of supplies by the\r\ncolonists to the French. It was obvious to all that this would do more\r\nharm than good, they said. Wheat stored in vessels ready to set out for\r\nGreat Britain was \"likely to perish.\" And unless the planters could\r\nsell their tobacco, it would be impossible for them to pay their taxes.\r\nAfter all, men asked, what authority had Loudoun to give such an order?\r\nThe Burgesses petitioned Dinwiddie to rescind it so far as Virginia was\r\nconcerned. They were determined to vote no more supplies until he did\r\nso.[30] Dinwiddie was forced to yield, and the fleet waiting in Virginia\r\nwaters cleared for Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAs one vessel after another sailed out between Cape Henry and Cape\r\nCharles, the Assembly acted quickly to support the war. They raised\r\nL6,000 to send out rangers against the Indians, L25,000 to pay arrears\r\ndue officers and men of the Virginia forces, and issued L80,000 in\r\nnon-interest bearing notes, renewable in seven years.[31] At once the\r\nold \"heats and disputes\" with the Governor were resumed. Dinwiddie was\r\nopposed to paper money, but the Burgesses, knowing that they had the\r\nwhip hand, would not yield. \"They took advantage of the emergency of our\r\naffairs, when without money every operation must be stopped, and the\r\nprotection of the country, the lives and properties of these very people\r\n[have] been exposed to the barbarous enemy,\" the Governor complained. \"I\r\nwas obliged at last, much against my judgment, to assent.\"[32]\r\n\r\nIn one vital matter the Burgesses themselves had to yield. The\r\nexpenditure of money appropriated during previous sessions had proved so\r\nunsatisfactory that they left all new disbursements to the Governor.\r\nThey appointed three commissioners to examine such accounts as he should\r\nturn over to them, but they were merely to assist, not control him.[33]\r\n\r\nDespite the one point of difference, Dinwiddie, in proroguing the\r\nAssembly, praised them for their \"dutiful obedience to his Majesty's\r\ncommands,\" and their compliance with what he himself had recommended. He\r\nhad told them earlier in the summer that his health had been failing and\r\nthat he had asked permission to resign his office and return to Great\r\nBritain. Now he said goodbye. \"I shall always retain a sincere regard\r\nfor the prosperity of this dominion,\" he said.[34] He sailed from\r\nYorktown in January, 1758.\r\n\r\nTo Robert Dinwiddie goes a large part of the credit for saving the major\r\npart of North America for British civilization. It was he who saw the\r\nmeaning of the encroachments of the French in the Ohio Valley; it was he\r\nwho sounded the alarm in both Great Britain and America. And when the\r\nfateful struggle with France was under way, his appreciation of what was\r\nat stake made him subordinate other issues to it. He broke his\r\ninstructions repeatedly because he thought it necessary in order to win\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in substantial gains for self-government in Virginia. In\r\nvoting funds, not only did the Assembly specify the uses to which they\r\nshould be put, but tried to supervise each disbursement. In sending the\r\nAcadians to England and forcing Dinwiddie to raise Loudoun's embargo\r\nthey showed their spirit of independence. The issuing of paper money was\r\nin direct conflict with the Governor's instructions. And the British\r\ngovernment dared not take steps to curb them so long as the French\r\nthreat remained.\r\n\r\nBut there is abundant evidence that the King's Ministers were merely\r\nbiding their time. The old laissez-faire policy of Sir Robert Walpole\r\nwas giving way to a closer scrutiny of colonial affairs. When the Earl\r\nof Loudoun was made Governor General of Virginia, he received more than\r\na hundred instructions. He must guard zealously the prerogative of the\r\nCrown, he must permit no riders to acts of Assembly, he must accept no\r\ngifts from the Assembly, he must not permit the issuing of paper money.\r\nThe twenty-fourth instruction is especially revealing of the accepted\r\nview in Great Britain that American interests must be disregarded if\r\nthey clashed with those of the mother country. The Governor was not to\r\nassent to any act putting duties on slaves to \"the great discouragement\"\r\nof British merchants, or duties on felons, since this was contrary to\r\nthe act of Parliament for \"preventing robbery, burglary, and other\r\nfelonies, and for the more effectual transportation of felons.\"\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that had the French power in America not been\r\nbroken, the colonists would not have dared to rebel against Great\r\nBritain. It would be more to the point that if the French threat had not\r\nbeen removed the British government would not have dared to drive the\r\nAmericans into rebellion. So long as the war with France lasted the\r\ncolonial Assemblies were masters of the situation; when it was over the\r\nassault on their liberty was not long delayed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is not too much to say that the war called the attention of\r\nthe British Government to the colonies. They could not have overlooked\r\nsuch letters as that from Dinwiddie to Pitt on June 18, 1757: \"I am\r\nconvinced if alterations are not made in the present constitutions of\r\nthe colonies, and have a general mode of government under his Majesty's\r\nimmediate directions, and a coalition of the whole, it will be\r\nimpracticable to conduct his Majesty's affairs with that spirit which\r\nthe present emergency requires.\"[35]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1752-1758: 99.\r\n\r\n[2] _Executive journals of the Council_ 5: 385.\r\n\r\n[3] Dinwiddie to the Lords of Trade, Jan. 22, 1754.\r\n\r\n[4] Jan. 22, 1754.\r\n\r\n[5] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1752-1758: 143, 144.\r\n\r\n[6] CO5-1328, pp. 85, 86.\r\n\r\n[7] June 16, 1753.\r\n\r\n[8] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1752-1758: 155.\r\n\r\n[9] Dinwiddie to Holdernesse, Dec. 29, 1753.\r\n\r\n[10] _Official records of Robert Dinwiddie_, ed.

He was a member of\r\nthe Royal Society, and, if we may judge from the presence in his library\r\nof a set of Palladio, a student of architecture.\r\n\r\nWhen Fauquier arrived, on June 5, 1758, he found the colonists absorbed\r\nin preparations to send strong forces to join General Forbes in his\r\nexpedition against Fort Duquesne. Ever since the French had established\r\nthemselves there it had been a nest from which swarms of Indians had\r\nmade raids on the frontier. \"I found this colony zealous in his\r\nMajesty's service, and very strenuous to support the common cause,\"\r\nFauquier wrote the Lords of Trade.[2]\r\n\r\nSecretary Pitt and General Abercrombie had written urging the Virginians\r\nto exert themselves to the utmost. John Blair, President of the Council\r\nand Acting Governor pending Fauquier's arrival, had called the Assembly\r\ntogether and asked them to vote funds for a new regiment. The vote was\r\nunanimous. They were eager to help in any attack on their \"cruel\r\nneighbors of Fort Duquesne.\" So now the colony resounded to the beat of\r\ndrums as officers brought in the recruits. Some ensigns raised ten, some\r\nlieutenants twenty, some captains seventy. To supply the men with arms,\r\nBlair stripped the magazine at Williamsburg and even took the muskets\r\nfrom the Governor's Palace. Tents and kettles he ordered from\r\nPhiladelphia, pledging the credit of the colony to pay for them.[3]\r\n\r\nThis was the situation when Fauquier landed, and it gave him reason to\r\nhope that Fort Duquesne would be in English hands early in the autumn.\r\nWhen long delays made this unlikely, he summoned the Assembly to ask for\r\nmore funds. But now he was confronted with a perplexing problem. It had\r\nlong been the practice for the House of Burgesses to make their Speaker\r\nthe Treasurer of the colony. Dinwiddie, probably because of a grudge\r\nagainst John Robinson, who held these two offices, had recommended their\r\nseparation. The Board of Trade approved and directed Fauquier to see\r\nthat this was done.[4] But the Governor held back. He was not long in\r\nfinding that Robinson was the most popular man in Virginia, the idol of\r\nthe people whether rich or poor. Had he insisted that someone else be\r\nmade Treasurer, the Burgesses would not have voted a penny for the\r\nexpedition. Fearing that the Board's instruction might be whispered\r\naround and come to Robinson's ear, he decided to take him into his\r\nconfidence and place the whole matter before him. The Speaker was much\r\ngratified. \"I am told by those who know his character that I have\r\nattached him to me in the strongest manner by the openness of my\r\nbehavior,\" Fauquier wrote the Board.[5] So the supply bill went through\r\nwith a rush. But the Board must have realized that their authority in\r\nthe colony had sunk to a new low when the Governor not only ignored\r\ntheir orders, but thought it necessary to apologize for them in order to\r\ncurry favor with the Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, things were going well in the war. Under the able\r\nleadership of Pitt, Great Britain had poured men and money into the\r\ncolonies, and replaced the incompetent Loudoun with the able General\r\nJeffrey Amherst. A blow of great importance for Virginia was struck when\r\na small force captured Fort Frontenac at the outlet of Lake Ontario.\r\nThis cut the French line of communication with the west and made Fort\r\nDuquesne untenable. So this key position fell without firing a shot. As\r\nForbes' army approached, the garrison blew up the fort, and taking to\r\ntheir canoes fell down the Ohio.\r\n\r\nFauquier congratulated himself for his part in this success. He had kept\r\nthe Burgesses in good humor; he had obtained the funds needed to keep\r\nthe Virginia troops in the field. If he had been lax in defending the\r\nKing's prerogative, surely the end justified the means. So he was not a\r\nlittle piqued when he received a reprimand from the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nThe trouble stemmed from the fact that tobacco provided a very poor\r\nstandard of value. When the crop was bountiful its purchasing power\r\nfell, if the summer were dry and the leaves withered in the field, it\r\ndoubled or tripled. In the first case debts and taxes could be paid at a\r\nlow value, in the other the value might be so great as to threaten\r\nwidespread injustice and suffering.\r\n\r\nIn 1748 by an act of Assembly the salary of the clergy had been fixed at\r\n16,000 pounds of tobacco. This law had received the King's assent, and\r\naccording to the \"ancient constitution,\" could not be repealed without\r\nhis approval. Yet, seven years later, when there had been a severe\r\ndrought, the Assembly passed an act permitting payment of all\r\nobligations in money at the rate of two pence a pound. The law was to\r\ncontinue in force for ten months only, and there was no clause\r\nsuspending its operation until the King had given his assent.\r\n\r\nThe clergy were bitter. They thought it hard that when the price of\r\ntobacco was low they were forced to accept it, but when it was high they\r\nwere to be paid in money at one third the market price of tobacco. In a\r\npetition to the House of Burgesses they pointed out that their average\r\nincome was so inadequate that they found it difficult to support their\r\nfamilies. It was this which explained why so few graduates of Oxford and\r\nCambridge entered the ministry in Virginia, and why so few in the colony\r\nthought it worth while to study divinity.[6]\r\n\r\nA delegation of four ministers called on Governor Dinwiddie to urge him\r\nto veto the bill. But Dinwiddie, who was begging for funds and troops,\r\nhad no stomach for a conflict with the Assembly over this affair. \"What\r\ncan I do?\" he told them. \"If I refuse to approve the act, I shall have\r\nthe people on my back.\" So he signed the bill.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to let the matter rest here, ten of the ministers, among them\r\nthe Reverend Patrick Henry, uncle of the statesman, appealed to the\r\nBishop of London. The unjust Two-penny Act would lower them in the eyes\r\nof the people, it would discourage them in the discharge of their duty.\r\nAnd, to clinch their argument, they pointed out that their cause was\r\nalso the cause of the King. \"Our salaries have had the royal assent and\r\ncannot be taken from us or diminished in any respect by any law made\r\nhere without trampling upon the royal prerogative.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThree years later, when again there was a \"prodigious dimunition\" in the\r\ntobacco crop, the Assembly acted to give relief to debtors and taxpayers\r\nby again making obligations payable in money at tuppence a pound. This\r\ntime the clergy made no appeal to the Burgesses, but Commissary Dawson,\r\nJohn Camm, and Thomas Robinson went to the Palace to urge Fauquier to\r\nveto the bill. Note that it has no suspending clause, they said. Note\r\nthat it alters a bill to which the King gave his assent. If you let it\r\npass, will you not be ignoring your instructions?[8]\r\n\r\nBut Fauquier was as much in need of funds as Dinwiddie had been. He\r\nanswered that that was not the point to be considered. What was\r\nimportant was what would please the people. So he gave the act his\r\napproval. \"The bill was a temporary law to ease the people from a burden\r\nwhich the country thought too great for them to bear,\" he wrote the\r\nLords of Trade. \"A suspending clause would have been to all intents and\r\npurposes the same as rejecting it.... The country were intent upon it\r\n... and I conceived it would be a very strong step for me to take ... to\r\nset my face against the whole colony.... I am persuaded that if I had\r\nrefused it, I must have despaired of our gaining any influence either in\r\nthe Council or the House of Burgesses.\"[9]\r\n\r\nBut the clergy were determined to bring the matter to an issue.\r\nCommissary Dawson advised caution, but pressure from other ministers\r\nforced him to call a convention. When they met they not only vented\r\ntheir indignation in many denunciations of the Two-penny Act, but drew\r\nup an address to the King entitled \"The Representation of the Clergy.\"\r\nIn it they hammered on the point that their cause was his cause. The act\r\nwas as injurious to the royal prerogative as to the rights of the\r\nChurch. \"It gives us great concern that an ancient, standing law of this\r\ndominion, confirmed by the sanction of the royal assent, is no security\r\nto our livings.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThis appeal they entrusted to the Reverend John Camm with instructions\r\nto place it in the King's hands. Camm, who later became Commissary,\r\nPresident of the College of William and Mary, and a member of the\r\nCouncil, was a man of great ability, but according to Fauquier,\r\nturbulent and delighting \"to live in a flame.\" On his arrival in England\r\nhe obtained an interview with the King and delivered the\r\n\"Representation.\" His Majesty referred it to the Privy Council, who, in\r\nturn, handed it on to the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nThis suited Camm exactly, for his trump card was the Bishop of London,\r\nand the Bishop's influence with the Board was great. His Lordship was\r\nexasperated at the presumption of the Virginia Assembly. \"To make an act\r\nto suspend the operations of the royal act is an attempt which in some\r\ntimes would have been called treason, and I do not know any other name\r\nfor it in our law,\" he told the Board. \"To assume a power to bind the\r\nKing's hands, and to say how far his power shall go and where it shall\r\nstop, is such an act of supremacy as is inconsistent with the dignity of\r\nthe Crown of England.\" It manifestly tended to draw the colonists from\r\ntheir allegiance to the King for them to find that they had a higher\r\npower to protect them. \"Surely it is time for us to look about us, and\r\nto consider the several steps lately taken in the diminution of the\r\nprerogative and influence of the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop denounced Governor Fauquier for signing the Two-penny bill.\r\n\"What made him so zealous in this cause I pretend not to judge, but\r\nsurely the great change which manifestly appears in the temper and\r\ndisposition of the people of this colony in the compass of a few years\r\ndeserves highly to be considered, and the more so as the Deputy\r\nGovernors and the Council seemed to act in concert with the people.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe Board was duly impressed. They denounced the Two-penny Act as a\r\nusurpation and advised the King to declare it null and void. Not only\r\ndid the King do so, but he gave Fauquier a stunning rebuke. \"We do ...\r\nstrictly command and require you for the future, upon pain of our\r\nhighest displeasure, and of being recalled from the government of our\r\nsaid colony, punctually to observe and obey the several directions\r\ncontained in the 16th article of our said instructions, relative to the\r\npassing of laws....\"[12]\r\n\r\nCamm sent copies of these papers to Virginia, and when they were handed\r\naround among his friends the clergy rejoiced. The King was on their\r\nside, all would be well. Camm wrote to his attorney in Virginia to bring\r\nsuit in the General Court against the vestry of his parish for his\r\nsalary in tobacco. On the other hand, the people of the colony were\r\nhighly resentful against the clergy, and especially against the Bishop\r\nof London. Colonel Landon Carter and Colonel Richard Bland wrote\r\npamphlets defending the Two-penny Act and denouncing his Lordship. To\r\nthe Bishop's contention that the act tended to draw the people from\r\ntheir allegiance, it was answered that nothing was more apt to estrange\r\nthem than to deny them the right to protect themselves from distress.\r\nHis Lordship had called the act treason. \"But were the Assembly to do\r\nnothing? This would have been treason indeed.\" In case of an eventuality\r\nwhich the Governor's instructions could not provide for, which could\r\nbring ruin before relief could come from the throne, it was the duty of\r\nthe Assembly to deviate from the fixed rules of the constitution. The\r\npreservation of the people could not possibly be treason.[13]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Fauquier had been waiting impatiently for his copies of\r\nthe King's veto and his instructions in the matter. Month after month\r\npassed and nothing came. Finally, late in June, ten months after they\r\nhad been written, Camm appeared with them at the door of the Palace.\r\nFauquier took them, and then denounced him for slandering him in\r\nEngland. Then he called out in a loud voice for his Negro servants, and\r\nwhen they had assembled, pointed his finger at Camm. \"Look at that\r\ngentleman and be sure to know him again, and under no circumstances\r\npermit him to revisit the Palace,\" he said.[14]\r\n\r\nAs time passed the war of pamphlets was renewed. In 1763 Camm wrote\r\nassailing Carter and Bland and trying to answer their arguments. But so\r\nunpopular was the cause of the clergy that no one in Virginia would\r\npublish what he wrote, and he had to have it done in Maryland. Bland\r\nretorted in a letter in the _Virginia Gazette_, and Camm came back in a\r\nletter which he called \"Observations.\"[15]\r\n\r\nInterest now centered on a test case in which the Reverend James Maury\r\nbrought suit for his salary in tobacco in the Hanover County court, in\r\nNovember, 1763. The court declared the Two-penny Act no law, since it\r\nhad been vetoed by the Crown, and ordered that at the next court the\r\njury should determine how much damages, if any, should be paid. Maury's\r\ncase seemed as good as won, and the attorney for the defendants, Mr.\r\nJohn Lewis, retired from the case. In his place they engaged a young,\r\nlittle-known lawyer, named Patrick Henry.\r\n\r\nIt was on December 1, 1763, that a great crowd assembled at the Hanover\r\ncourthouse, filling the little room and overflowing into the yard. Among\r\nthem were twenty clergymen. But when Henry saw his uncle there, he\r\npersuaded him to leave. John Henry, Patrick's father, presided. When\r\nseveral gentlemen refused to serve on the jury, the sheriff was forced\r\nto fill their places with men of the small farmer class. Several were\r\ndissenters.\r\n\r\nThe case was opened by Mr. Peter Lyons, attorney for the plaintiff. When\r\nhe had concluded, Henry rose to reply. At first he seemed hesitant and\r\nawkward. But soon he warmed up to his subject. His eyes kindled, his\r\ngestures were bolder, he seemed to grow more erect, his voice resounded\r\nthrough the room. His audience were spellbound, and on every bench, at\r\nthe door, in every window people leaned forward, their eyes fixed on the\r\nyouthful orator.\r\n\r\nHenry contended that there was a contract between King and people. The\r\nKing owed the people protection; the people owed the King obedience and\r\nsupport. But should either violate the contract, it released the other\r\nfrom the obligation. The Two-penny Act was good and essential, and its\r\ndisallowance was a breach of the contract. It was an instance of\r\nmisrule, a neglect of the interests of the colony. The King, from being\r\nthe father of his people, became a tyrant who had forfeited the\r\nobedience of the subjects. At this point Mr. Lyons cried out: \"The\r\ngentleman has spoken treason.\" And from various parts of the room arose\r\na murmur of \"treason! treason!\"\r\n\r\nBut Henry turned to the ministers seated before him and denounced them\r\nand the rest of the clergy in blazing words for trying to triple their\r\nsalaries at the expense of the people. \"Do they manifest their zeal in\r\nthe cause of religion and humanity by practicing the mild and benevolent\r\nprecepts of the Gospel of Jesus?... Oh no! Gentlemen. Instead of feeding\r\nthe hungry and clothing the naked these rapacious harpies would ...\r\nsnatch from the hearth of their honest parishioner his last hoe-cake,\r\nfrom the widow and her orphaned child their last milch-cow.\"[16] At this\r\nthe ministers got up and left the room. When the jury brought in a\r\nverdict of one penny damages, the throng shouted their approval. Strong\r\narms lifted Henry aloft and bore him out of the courthouse.\r\n\r\nHenry's contention in essence was that the people of the colonies had a\r\nright to govern themselves. And in this he was but finding legal\r\narguments for the existing state of affairs. The Assembly, after a\r\ncentury and a half of battling with Kings and Governors, had made itself\r\nto all intents and purposes supreme. In annulling the Two-penny Act the\r\nKing crossed lances with the representatives of the people and had come\r\noff second best. The jury, sitting in the little country courthouse,\r\nunder the urging of an obscure lawyer, had defied him. Thus, two years\r\nbefore the Stamp Act, Virginia inaugurated the policy of resistance.\r\nMost of Henry's arguments were borrowed from the Carter and Bland\r\npamphlets, but whereas they pleaded, he secured positive action. In so\r\nfar as the Two-penny Act was concerned, the King's veto power was\r\nannulled.\r\n\r\nBland summed up the constitutional argument behind this action in a\r\npamphlet written at the time of the trial but published only eight\r\nmonths later. \"Under an English government all men are born free, are\r\nonly subject to laws made by their own consent.... If then the people of\r\nthis colony are free born, and have a right to the liberties and\r\nprivileges of English subjects, they must necessarily have a legal\r\nconstitution, that is a legislature, composed in part of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, who may enact laws for the INTERNAL\r\ngovernment of the colony, ... and without such a representative I am\r\nbold to say no law can be made.\"[17]\r\n\r\nBut the stubborn Mr. Camm was determined not to give up. In April, 1764,\r\nhis cause came up in the General Court after a delay of five years. The\r\ncase against him was argued by Robert Carter Nicholas, who claimed that\r\nwhen the Governor had approved a law it was legal, even though in so\r\ndoing he broke his instructions. A majority of the court[18] were\r\nconvinced and voted that the Two-penny Act of 1758 was valid despite the\r\nKing's veto.[19] Camm appealed the case to the Privy Council. It came\r\nup in 1767, and was thrown out on a technicality. In this way they\r\navoided giving further offense to the colony without admitting the\r\nvalidity of their claims.\r\n\r\nThe controversy over the Two-penny Act came at a time when the Board of\r\nTrade was at odds with the Virginia Assembly over the repeated issues of\r\npaper money. Had Dinwiddie and Fauquier not assured them that without\r\nthese issues there would have been no funds with which to carry on the\r\nwar, they would certainly have put a stop to them. As it was, all they\r\ncould do was to urge that steps be taken to prevent the paper from\r\ndeclining in value and to protect the interests of the British\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1757 each issue had borne five per cent interest, and taxes had\r\nbeen voted for their redemption. But in April of that year the notes\r\nwere all called in and new ones issued in their place bearing no\r\ninterest. This, with a new issue of L80,000 brought the total to\r\nL179,962.10.0. This was more than was needed to carry on the business of\r\nthe colony, and the value of the notes began to sink.[20] In 1748 an act\r\nhad been passed declaring that debts contracted in sterling could be\r\npaid in Virginia currency at a twenty-five per cent advance, or one\r\npound five shillings for one pound sterling. But as the rate of exchange\r\nwas not long in rising above this figure, the merchants feared large\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nThe London merchants, speaking not only for themselves, but for those of\r\nBristol, Liverpool, and Glasgow, laid their complaint before the Board\r\nof Trade. The issuing of large amounts of paper money could be most\r\ninjurious to trade by putting it upon an uncertain basis, they said. And\r\nto pay debts contracted in sterling in depreciated colonial currency was\r\nas unjust as it was unwise. So they asked the King to instruct the\r\nGovernor to urge the Assembly to amend the act of 1748 to make all debts\r\ndue to persons in Great Britain payable according to the real difference\r\nin exchange.[21]\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that the merchants and the Board of Trade did not know\r\nthat what they asked for had already been done. In 1755 the act of 1748\r\nhad been amended so as to direct the courts in cases where contracts had\r\nbeen made in sterling, to order payment in Virginia money at the rate of\r\nexchange they thought just.[22] \"The merchants do not know the law,\"\r\nFauquier wrote the Board. \"Let the value of paper currency fall as much\r\nas they please ... exchange will rise as fast, and they will obtain for\r\na sterling debt just as much of the paper currency as will purchase a\r\ngood sterling bill of exchange. And what injury is done them unless ...\r\nthe whole court combine in a barefaced villainy to defraud them?\" At the\r\nlast court the exchange had been fixed at 35 per cent.[23]\r\n\r\nThe amendment to the law of 1748 had had no clause suspending its\r\noperation until the King had given his assent, and, like the Two-penny\r\nAct, was a clear infringement on the royal prerogative. But since it had\r\nmerely anticipated the King's wishes, it drew no rebuke from him. None\r\nthe less, it was one more step toward autonomy, one more demonstration\r\nthat in internal affairs the Virginians were a self-governing people.\r\n\r\nThe fixing of the rate of exchange quieted the merchants for the time\r\nbeing, even though they looked on uneasily as Fauquier assented to\r\nfurther emissions, for L57,000 in September, 1758; L52,000 in February,\r\n1759; L10,000 in November, 1759; L20,000 in March, 1760; L32,000 in May,\r\n1760; and L30,000 in March, 1762. The whole totalled nearly L413,000,\r\nand William Hunter's printing press at Williamsburg was kept busy\r\nstamping out notes of L10, L15, L3, 10 shillings, 3 shillings, etc. In\r\nthe meanwhile, only L51,156.10.0. had been retired and burnt, leaving\r\nL362,000 in circulation.[24]\r\n\r\nLong before this figure had been reached, opposition to paper money had\r\ngrown within the colony itself. The law which protected the British\r\nmerchants did not apply to Virginia creditors, since their contracts\r\nusually had been made in the local currency. So, as the flood of paper\r\ncontinued to mount, the small farmer or shopkeeper who had borrowed from\r\nhis wealthy neighbor, could pay him back in depreciated notes. And as\r\nthey were legal tender, he had to accept them. \"Debtors pursued their\r\ncreditors relentlessly and paid them without mercy.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1762, though a bill to issue L30,000 in paper money passed the House\r\nby a vote of 66 to 3, it hung fire in the Council. At the time there\r\nwere only six members in attendance, three of whom opposed any further\r\nemissions, so Fauquier got the Speaker to hold back the bill while he\r\nsent out a hurry call for the others. In the end the bill passed by a\r\nvote of five to four. \"On this occasion I have stretched my influence to\r\nthe utmost pitch,\" the Governor wrote the Board.[25] The four dissenting\r\nCouncillors--William Nelson, Thomas Nelson, Richard Corbin, and Philip\r\nLudwell Lee--all of them rich men, made a vigorous protest, which was\r\nentered upon the Journal.[26]\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this, Corbin took the step, unusual for a member of\r\nthe Upper House, of complaining to the Board of Trade against an act of\r\nAssembly. He was astute enough to base his case, not on his personal\r\nlosses, but on the losses to the revenue and to the merchants. Taxes had\r\nbeen paid in the depreciated currency. In turn this had made it\r\nimpossible to meet the needs of the government and at the same time sink\r\nthe outstanding notes. As for the merchants, though it was true that\r\nsterling contracts were to be paid at the current rate of exchange, and\r\nthough the judges who determined it seemed to be impartial, the rate\r\nmight rise from five to fifteen per cent between the date of their\r\ndecision and the date of settlement, to their great loss.[27]\r\n\r\nWhen the British merchants heard that some of the most prominent men in\r\nVirginia had sided with them in urging that an end be put to currency\r\ninflation, they were encouraged to renew their complaints to the Board\r\nof Trade. The Board, in turn, wrote Fauquier to urge the Assembly to\r\ngive them satisfaction. So the Governor, on May 19, 1763, addressed the\r\nHouse, pointing out that common justice required that every man should\r\nreceive full payment for debts due him. And the support of the public\r\ncredit, so vital for a trading country like Virginia, made it absolutely\r\nnecessary to redeem the paper in circulation at the dates fixed by\r\nlaw.[28]\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses responded by adding to the fund for sinking the paper\r\nmoney by laying additional taxes on slaves, wheel carriages, licenses,\r\netc.[29] But they would not budge from their determination to keep all\r\nthe notes legal tender. And they made a long and able reply to the\r\nGovernor, drawn up by Charles Carter, Edmund Pendleton, Wythe, and\r\nRichard Henry Lee, justifying their proceedings and claiming that the\r\nmerchants had no just grounds for complaint. In it they inserted a\r\ndeclaration of American rights which the British Ministry would have\r\nbeen wise to take to heart. Their dependence upon Great Britain they\r\nacknowledged as their greatest happiness and only security. But this was\r\nnot the dependence of a conquered people, but of sons sent out to\r\nexplore and settle a new world for the mutual benefit of themselves and\r\ntheir common parent. It was the dependence of the part upon the whole,\r\nwhich, by its admirable constitution, diffused a spirit of patriotism\r\nwhich made every citizen, however remote from the mother kingdom,\r\nzealous for the King and the public good.[30]\r\n\r\nBut the merchants were far from being satisfied, and a group in Glasgow\r\nsent another appeal to the Board of Trade. They thought that part of the\r\ntrouble came from the ease with which paper money could be\r\ncounterfeited. And they were sure that the hundreds of counterfeit\r\nnotes, passing from hand to hand in Virginia, partly accounted for the\r\nenormous heights of exchange. But they supported the Assembly in\r\ncontinuing the legal tender clause. To take it off might make the\r\ncurrency debts \"more fluctuating, uncertain, and less valuable.\" The\r\nonly effectual remedy was to forbid further issues of paper money, to\r\nsee that notes as they were brought into the treasury were duly burnt,\r\nto order that circulating notes bear five per cent interest, and to\r\nremedy any deficiency in the taxes.[31] When Parliament passed an act to\r\nprohibit future emissions in the colonies, they seemed satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut there was a strong underlying sentiment in the colony against\r\nburning the notes. The soil of tidewater Virginia, after a century and a\r\nhalf of cultivation, was beginning to wear out, and thousands of acres\r\nwere gradually reverting to forest land. This, with war taxes and an\r\noccasional drought, had brought hard times. But the planters, instead of\r\ntightening their belts, continued the old extravagant mode of living by\r\nborrowing money. \"I fear they are not prudent enough to quit any article\r\nof luxury till smart obliges them,\" observed Fauquier.[32] So for many\r\ncheap money meant salvation from ruin.\r\n\r\nThese men made their influence felt in the House when a scheme for\r\nborrowing L240,000 from the British merchants was passed in May, 1765.\r\nOf this sum L100,000 was to be used for a new currency to replace old\r\nnotes, and L140,000 to be lent out at five per cent interest. But when\r\nthe bill came up to the Council it was bitterly opposed by Corbin and\r\nfinally defeated.[33]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, people were wondering why the rate of exchange did not\r\ndrop. They were not ignorant of the quantative law of currency, and they\r\nknew that the amount of paper in circulation ought to have been reduced\r\neach year. So they were surprised to find it remaining between sixty and\r\nsixty-five per cent. Behind this apparent contradiction of economic law\r\nthere must be some mystery.[34]\r\n\r\nThe mystery was explained in May, 1766, when a bomb exploded which shook\r\nthe colony from the capes to the Alleghenies. That month the beloved\r\nJohn Robinson, Speaker and Treasurer, died. Fauquier had called him \"the\r\ndarling of the country.\" The _Gazette_ lamented his loss and praised\r\n\"the many amiable virtues which adorned his private station.\"\r\n\r\nSo there was universal astonishment when the examiners of his accounts\r\nfound a deficit of L100,000. Robinson had not taken the money for his\r\nown use. Even had he been dishonorable enough to do so, there would have\r\nbeen no need for it, since he was one of the richest men in the colony.\r\nWhat he had done was to lend his friends thousands of pounds from the\r\npublic funds.[35] In this he was guilty of two serious breaches of his\r\nduty. Since the Assembly had refused to establish a public loan office,\r\nhe must have known that he had no right to do so on his own\r\nresponsibility. And there could be no excuse for his disregard of the\r\nlaw which required that he burn the paper money as it came in.\r\n\r\nBut when his friends came to him in distress begging loans to save them\r\nfrom ruin, he did not have the strength of character to refuse them.\r\nThousands of pounds went out to men in all parts of the colony, among\r\nthem members of some of the oldest and most distinguished\r\nfamilies--William Byrd III, Charles Carter, Jr., George Braxton, Henry\r\nFitzhugh, Lewis Burwell, etc. Robinson's estate was large enough to\r\ncover all these loans, but it took many years for his executors to\r\nrecover even part of what was due him.\r\n\r\nRobert Carter Nicholas, Robinson's successor as Treasurer, was bitter in\r\ncondemnation of what he had done. \"The seeming mysteries of our exchange\r\nnow begin to unfold themselves,\" he wrote in a letter to the _Gazette_.\r\n\"It comes out that a great part of the money squeezed from the people\r\nfor their taxes, instead of being sunk ... was thrown back into\r\ncirculation.\" The Assembly had given their word that they would protect\r\nthe interests of the British merchants by burning the paper promptly on\r\nthe dates of their retirement. What must the world think when these good\r\nintentions had been in part defeated by a strange kind of misconduct?\r\nWhat made it worse was the need the colony had for the friendship of the\r\nmerchants at a time when the great men in England had their eyes fixed\r\nupon all the Assemblies. \"The consequences are as glaring as the sun in\r\nthe meridian.\"[36]\r\n\r\nNicholas saw to it that the law was obeyed. As the notes came in they\r\nwere burnt. As a result the exchange began to drop until in a few months\r\nit became normal. The day of easy money was over, and the host of\r\ndebtors faced ruin. For many months the pages of the _Gazette_ were\r\ncrowded with notices of slaves and plantations for sale.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the century and a half old struggle between mother\r\ncountry and colonies was rapidly approaching a crisis. The issue had\r\nlong been postponed because of the inactivity of the King's ministers,\r\nwho were content to close their eyes to what was going on across the\r\nAtlantic. But the time was at hand when the question of whether the\r\nAmericans should be governed from London or should govern themselves had\r\nto be settled.\r\n\r\nThis was in part due to the fact that as time passed Parliament had\r\ngrown less and less representative of the people. In Great Britain there\r\nwas no provision, as there is in the Constitution of the United States,\r\nfor periodic reapportionments of the people's representatives to keep\r\nstep with changes in population. For centuries most of the Commons had\r\nbeen elected under a very restricted franchise by certain old boroughs.\r\nThough with the passing of the decades many of these boroughs, once\r\ncenters of population and wealth, had fallen into decay, they still sent\r\ntheir representatives to the House of Commons. Perhaps the most\r\nnotorious was Old Sarum, a city of Norman times, whose castle and\r\ncathedral and crowded houses overlooked the Salisbury plain, but which\r\nfor centuries had been deserted. Unless the ghosts of men long dead were\r\nto have a voice in running the nation, it was absurd for these old ruins\r\nto be represented in the Commons. In practice the rotten borough system,\r\nas it was called, tended to perpetuate the ascendency of the landed\r\nproprietors.\r\n\r\nAnd the country squires wanted no change. They thought the British\r\nGovernment the best in the world, and were determined to defend their\r\nprivileges. It never occurred to them that duty required that they\r\nshould try to alleviate the miseries of the poor people; they were too\r\nintent on enjoying their great manor houses, their formal gardens, their\r\nstately dinners, their fox hunts, to heed the voices which were pleading\r\nfor social and political reform.[37]\r\n\r\nBut it would be a mistake to assume that Great Britain had become static\r\nin intellectual, social, and institutional matters. On the contrary, the\r\nfirst seven decades of the eighteenth century was a period of tremendous\r\nactivity. It was the period of Richardson and Fielding in literature, of\r\nthe great religious revival led by Wesley and Whitefield, of renewed\r\ninterest in Shakespeare, of the birth of industrial Britain, of the bold\r\ndefiance of authority by John Wilkes. Had Parliament truly reflected the\r\nspirit of the age, had it not revered the old system of government as\r\nthe best attainable by man, it would have attuned itself to these\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nIf the Commons were out of step with the march of events in Great\r\nBritain, they were far more so with developments in the colonies. They\r\nknew nothing of the influence of the vast natural resources and the\r\nlimited supply of labor in lifting the level of the common man and\r\ngiving him a sense of self-respect, nothing of the democratizing power\r\nof the frontier. And what little they saw they disliked. No doubt some\r\nwould have applauded Samuel Johnson when he said of the Americans: \"Sir,\r\nthey are a race of convicts, and ought to be thankful for anything we\r\nallow them short of hanging.\"\r\n\r\nWith such irreconcilable differences between the ruling group in Great\r\nBritain and the people of the colonies the conflict was inevitable. The\r\nKing, the Privy Council, the Board of Trade, the Commons construed the\r\nmany instances of colonial disobedience as attacks on the foundations\r\nof the established order, as revolutionary innovations. To Americans\r\nthey seemed no more than the assertion of rights inherent in all free\r\nmen. And though many of their claims had no precedent in English\r\nexperience, they began to speak of them as ancient and necessary for the\r\nexistence of representative government.\r\n\r\nThat the clash came when it did was in part due to the passing of the\r\nlaissez-faire period in the British Government. New figures had made\r\ntheir appearance at Whitehall, who had no patience with the old slipshod\r\nway of doing things. They wanted a consolidated empire, ruled from\r\nLondon, rather than a loose federation of semi-independent states. To\r\nthem it seemed intolerable that the colonial Assemblies should defy the\r\nKing at will. \"Must we and America be two distinct kingdoms, and that\r\nnow immediately?\" asked George Grenville.\r\n\r\nThe French and Indian War revealed much concerning conditions in the\r\ncolonies which surprised and alarmed the Ministry. They had found it\r\nimpossible to get the colonies to act in unison, they had defied the\r\nKing's wishes repeatedly, the Governors were kept busy explaining why\r\nthey had to disregard one instruction after another, they were disgusted\r\nat the pouring out of paper money, and they must have been influenced by\r\nthe warnings that the Americans were too much of a republican way of\r\nthinking. The advice to have Parliament lay a general tax on the\r\ncolonies had come, not only from Dinwiddie, but from various parts of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the Ministry to follow this advice was based\r\nostensibly on the reasonableness of requiring the colonies to bear their\r\nshare of the burden of the expense of the war. It may be argued that\r\nVirginia and some of the others, because of the disruption of trade, the\r\nvery heavy taxes, the devastation on the frontiers, and their heavy\r\nlosses in men, had already paid more than their share. But that there\r\nwas something deeper, more vital, behind the resolve to tax than a mere\r\nmatter of finance, is obvious. It was a demonstration of policy, a\r\nmanifesto that Great Britain was determined to govern her colonies.\r\n\r\nWhen word reached America that the Ministry planned to tax the colonies\r\nby a stamp Act, there was general dismay. There were many grave faces\r\namong the Burgesses as they took their seats in November, 1764. Some of\r\nthe ablest men in Virginia, among them Peyton Randolph, Edmund\r\nPendleton, George Wythe, and Richard Henry Lee, drew up a protest to\r\nthe King and Parliament. They begged the King to protect the people of\r\nthe colony in the enjoyment of their ancient right of being governed in\r\ninternal affairs by laws derived from their own consent, with the\r\napprobation of their sovereign or his substitute. This right, as men and\r\ndescendants of Britons, they had possessed ever since they left the\r\nmother kingdom to extend its commerce and dominion.\r\n\r\nTo the House of Lords they pointed out that, as their ancestors had\r\nbrought with them to America every right and privilege they could claim\r\nin the mother kingdom, their descendants could not justly be deprived of\r\nthem. It was a fundamental principle of the British Constitution,\r\nwithout which freedom could nowhere exist, that the people are not\r\nsubject to any taxes except by their own consent or by those who were\r\nlegally appointed to represent them.\r\n\r\nThey reminded the Commons that this principle had been recognized ever\r\nsince the founding of the colony. During the reign of Charles II, when\r\nthe British Government sought a revenue to support the government of\r\nVirginia, they had tacitly admitted that Parliament had no right to levy\r\nthe tax. Instead they drew up a bill in England and sent it over to be\r\nacted on by the Assembly.[38]\r\n\r\nAs they penned this protest the thoughts of Wythe and the others must\r\nhave reverted to the part played by the control of taxation in winning\r\nself-government for the colony. They spoke of their rights as ancient,\r\nyet they must have known that the Virginia of their day was far freer\r\nthan it had been under the Stuarts. And there could be no doubt as to\r\nhow this great change had come about. They and their fathers and their\r\ngreat-grandfathers had used the control of the purse to whittle the\r\nroyal prerogative until little was left. For Parliament to strike this\r\nweapon from their hands would be to nullify the gains of many decades\r\nand leave them defenseless.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill to tax the Americans came before the Commons, on February\r\n7, 1765, a lengthy debate followed. It was on this occasion that Colonel\r\nIsaac Barre retorted to Charles Townshend's assertion that the Americans\r\nhad been \"planted by our care, nourished by our indulgence.\" \"Your\r\noppressions planted them in America,\" he shouted. \"They grew up by your\r\nneglect of them.... They protected by your arms! They have taken up\r\narms in your defence.\"[39] But when the Virginia memorial was presented\r\nit was rejected by an overwhelming majority.[40] The bill passed the\r\nCommons by 205 votes to 49, and the House of Lords without a division.\r\nThe measure required the colonists to use stamps, purchased from the\r\nBritish Government through royal agents, on newspapers, almanacs,\r\npamphlets, advertisements, and various kinds of legal documents.\r\n\r\nIt was with heavy hearts that the Assembly met in May, 1765. Edmund\r\nPendleton, when news of the passage of the Stamp Act reached him, had\r\nexclaimed, \"Poor America!\" As he, George Wythe, Richard Bland, Robert\r\nCarter Nicholas, Henry Lee, Peyton Randolph, and other leading statesmen\r\ntook their seats, they had no thought of resistance. They proceeded with\r\nroutine business--the authorizing of a ferry over the Potomac, giving\r\nrewards for killing wolves, opening a road through the Swift Run Gap,\r\npreventing escapes from debtors' prisons, etc. Probably none of the\r\naristocrats from the tidewater paid any attention to young Patrick Henry\r\nwhen he joined the House late in the session. When most of the bills had\r\npassed the third reading many of the members left, and mounting their\r\nhorses rode out of town, leaving only thirty-nine to wind up business.\r\n\r\nThis was Henry's opportunity. Opening an old law book he wrote down\r\nseven resolutions. Then, rising, he introduced them in the House. In\r\nsubstance the first four declared that Virginians from the first\r\nsettlement had possessed all the privileges of the people of Great\r\nBritain, that these privileges had been confirmed to them by two royal\r\ncharters, that the taxation of the people by themselves was the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of British freedom, and that the people of\r\nthe colony had never forfeited the right to be governed by their own\r\nAssembly in the articles of taxation and internal policy.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry came to the fifth resolution there must have been a gasp of\r\nsurprise. It held that any attempt to vest the power to tax the colonies\r\nin any other body than the Assembly was illegal, unjust, and\r\nunconstitutional, and tended to destroy British as well as American\r\nliberty. Henry did not introduce the other two resolutions, probably\r\nbecause of the uproar which the reading of the fifth occasioned.\r\n\r\nA violent debate ensued. George Wythe, John Robinson, Peyton Randolph,\r\nand others thought the language too extreme. But what Fauquier described\r\nas \"the young, hot, and giddy members,\" were carried along by Henry's\r\neloquence. \"Tarquin and Caesar each had his Brutus, Charles I his\r\nCromwell, and George III....\" At this point he was interrupted by the\r\nSpeaker who declared that he had spoken treason. Henry denied that he\r\nadvocated treason. If he had said anything wrong, it should be\r\nattributed to his concern over his country's dying liberty.[41]\r\n\r\nThe first four resolutions passed by safe margins, but the fifth barely\r\ngot by, by a vote of twenty to nineteen. In alarm the more conservative\r\nmembers sent out a hurry call for such absent Burgesses as were still in\r\nor near Williamsburg. When several had come in an attempt was made to\r\nhave the resolutions struck off the journal. They succeeded with the\r\nfifth, Fauquier reported, \"which was thought the most offensive,\" but\r\nfailed with the other four.[42]\r\n\r\nPerhaps Henry, himself, as he left Williamsburg, wearing a pair of\r\nleather breeches and leading his bony nag by the bridle, did not realize\r\nthat his resolutions would be the alarm bell of revolution. The\r\n_Maryland Gazette_, the _Newport Gazette_, the _Boston Gazette_, and\r\nother papers published them, not only the four which passed in the\r\nHouse, but the other three as well. And the sixth and seventh were\r\nradical indeed. They declared that the people of the colony were not\r\nbound to obey any laws to tax them other than those passed by the\r\nAssembly, and that any person who should uphold such laws \"by speaking\r\nor writing\" should be deemed an enemy of the colony. It was the policy\r\nof resistance.\r\n\r\nVirginia was now aflame. It was rumored that groups of men from all\r\nparts of the colony were preparing to march on Williamsburg to seize and\r\ndestroy the stamps as soon as they arrived. Many justices declared that\r\nthey would resign rather than use the stamps in the processes of their\r\ncourts, and it seemed certain that others would follow their example.\r\nFrom Westmoreland came word that a mob had burned in effigy the stamp\r\ndistributor for Virginia, Colonel George Mercer, a native Virginian who\r\nhad served in the French and Indian War.[43] Fauquier waited anxiously\r\nfor his arrival with the stamps, praying that adverse winds would delay\r\nhim until the session of the General Court was over and the crowds of\r\nmerchants, persons involved in suits, debtors, witnesses, and others had\r\nleft town.\r\n\r\nBut the Fates were against him. Mercer arrived on October 30, and at\r\nonce went to his father's house. Having word of this, a crowd of men,\r\nsome of them leading citizens in their home counties, started off to\r\nfind him. As they approached the Capitol they met him and asked him\r\nwhether he intended to retain his office as stamp distributor. To this\r\nhe gave an evasive answer, and continued to the coffee house nearby\r\nwhere Governor Fauquier, Speaker Robinson, and several members of the\r\nCouncil were seated on the porch. The crowd, which had followed him,\r\npressed toward them and a cry was heard, \"Let us rush in.\" But when\r\nFauquier and the others advanced to repel them, someone called out, \"See\r\nthe Governor, take care of him.\" Upon this they fell back. And when\r\nMercer promised that he would give his answer at the Capitol the next\r\nday at five, they seemed satisfied and permitted him to walk through\r\nthem side by side with the Governor to the Palace.[44]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, word of Mercer's arrival had spread through the\r\ncountryside, so that the next day hundreds of persons poured into town.\r\nAs five o'clock approached a vast crowd assembled in the Capitol yard.\r\nThere Mercer spoke to them. His appointment had been unsolicited, he\r\nsaid. He had not, as had been rumored, urged the passage of the Stamp\r\nAct. \"And now,\" he added, \"I will not, directly by myself or deputies\r\nproceed in the execution of the act ... without the assent of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of this colony.\" At this there was a great shout of\r\napproval, and those near him raised him aloft and bore him out through\r\nthe gate to a nearby tavern. As they entered, the huzzas were redoubled,\r\nwhile drums rattled, and horns blared. That night the town was\r\nilluminated and bells rang out. The following night the occasion was\r\nclimaxed by \"a splendid ball.\"[45]\r\n\r\nAs for the stamps, they never touched land. They were transferred to a\r\nwarship, \"it being the place of the greatest, if not the only security\r\nfor them.\" If the mob could have laid their hands on them they would\r\ncertainly have gone up in flames.\r\n\r\nNow in various parts of the colony men met to organize what they called\r\nSons of Liberty. The merchants of Norfolk, native-born Scotsmen many of\r\nthem, had a double grievance, since the Sugar Act threatened their trade\r\nand the Stamp Act their liberty. In March about thirty leading citizens\r\nmet at the house of Mayor Calvert, where \"they brought daylight on\"\r\ndebating the best way to resist both acts. At their call the people\r\ncrowded into the courthouse to protest. \"We will ... defend ourselves in\r\nthe full enjoyment of ... those inestimable privileges of freeborn\r\nBritish subjects of being taxed only by representatives of their own\r\nchoosing.... If we quietly submit to the execution of the said Stamp\r\nAct, all our claims of civil liberty will be lost, and we and our\r\nposterity become absolute slaves.\"[46]\r\n\r\nA few days later, when word went round that a certain Captain William\r\nSmith had been responsible for the seizure of several vessels in the\r\nElizabeth River, he was arrested by a group of leading citizens.\r\nHurrying him to the County Wharf, they tarred and feathered him, set him\r\nin the ducking stool, and pelted him with stones and rotten eggs. They\r\nnext marched him through the town with drums beating, ducked him again,\r\nand at last threw him headlong into the water. Had not a passing boat\r\npulled him out, more dead than alive, he would have been drowned.[47]\r\n\r\nAt Hobb's Hole, Essex County, a merchant named Ritchie barely escaped\r\nsimilar treatment. A number of men, hearing that he had boasted that he\r\ncould secure stamps and was determined to clear his ship with them,\r\nmarched on the town and drew up along the main street. They brought\r\nRitchie out and threatened to strip him to the waist, tie him to the\r\ntail of a cart, and then fix him in the pillory. This was too much for\r\nhim. Reluctantly he swore on \"the holy Evangels\" that no vessel of his\r\nwould clear \"on stamped paper.\" Thereupon most of the crowd dispersed,\r\nand those living nearby went to the tavern \"where they spent the evening\r\nwith great sobriety.\"[48]\r\n\r\nThe people of the colony were encouraged in their resistance to the\r\nStamp Act by articles in British gazettes and magazines, which were\r\nreprinted in the _Virginia Gazette_. A writer in the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_ contended that the act violated the British constitution,\r\nwhich \"declared that no Englishman is to be taxed without his own\r\nconsent.\" \"I know very well I shall be told that though the Americans\r\nare not immediately represented in the English Parliament, they are\r\nnevertheless represented virtually.... But why, in the name of common\r\nsense, if the mother country judged herself the virtual representative\r\nof all her various dependencies, did she grant a provincial legislature\r\nto her colonies, and from the time of their first existence invest this\r\nlegislature with the sole power of internal taxation?\" For the colonists\r\nto yield, he thought, would be to confess themselves slaves.[49]\r\n\r\nAnd when the Virginians read the _Gazette_ they noted with satisfaction\r\nthat the disruption of trade was causing great distress in England. A\r\ndispatch from Birmingham stated that unless the Stamp Act were repealed\r\ntwenty thousand persons would be out of work.[50] The merchants of\r\nLondon petitioned the Commons for relief. Their trade with the colonies,\r\nwhich was of such great importance to the nation, faced utter ruin, they\r\nsaid. They could not collect debts due them in America, because the\r\nSugar Act and the Stamp Act had thrown the colonies into confusion and\r\nbrought on many bankruptcies. Unless these acts were repealed a\r\nmultitude of workers would become a burden on the community or else seek\r\ntheir bread in other countries.[51]\r\n\r\nIt was late in May, 1766, that a vessel arrived in Virginia waters\r\nbearing the news that the Stamp Act had been repealed. As horsemen\r\ngalloped along the roads and boatsmen in their shallops ascended the\r\ngreat rivers, the word was passed from mouth to mouth. Everywhere there\r\nwas joyous celebration. At Great Bridge the people listened to a\r\npatriotic sermon in St. Giles Church, and then went to the Banqueting\r\nRoom, where they raised their glasses in a series of toasts--to the King\r\nand Queen, Colonel Barre, and others. At Hampton there was a banquet at\r\nthe Bunch of Grapes, followed by a ball at the King's Arms Tavern, while\r\noutside there was a great bonfire.[52] The people of Williamsburg waited\r\nfor their celebration until the convening of the court when the town\r\nwas crowded. Then every house was illuminated, and there was \"a ball and\r\nelegant entertainment at the Capitol,\" marked by \"much mirth\" and the\r\ndrinking of toasts.[53]\r\n\r\nWith the French and Indian War brought to a successful conclusion, with\r\nthe problem of currency inflation settled, with the Stamp Act repealed,\r\nit seemed that Fauquier might look forward to a period of harmony and\r\nprosperity. But fate soon struck a cruel blow. In the summer of 1767 the\r\nGovernor became ill with a very painful disorder. And though, under the\r\ncare of Dr. Matthew Pope, of York, he became better, he never fully\r\nrecovered his health.[54] He died in the early hours of March 3, 1768.\r\nIn his will he directed that if the nature of his illness should not be\r\nunderstood by his physicians, an autopsy be held on his body, so that he\r\nmight become more useful to his fellow creatures in death than he had\r\nbeen in life. He desired, also, that he be buried \"without any vain\r\nfuneral pomp.\"[55]\r\n\r\nFrancis Fauquier was an able, just, tactful Governor, who tried to do\r\nhis duty both to the King and to the colony. His was an extremely\r\ndifficult task. His sympathies seem to have been with the people. Living\r\namong them, knowing their views, he must have deplored the policy of the\r\nMinistry in trying to deprive them of the cherished right of\r\nself-government. Great Britain's strongest link with America was not the\r\nlink of government, not even the economic link, but the link of\r\naffection. And nothing tended more to strengthen it than the appointment\r\nof such a man as Fauquier to be Lieutenant Governor of the largest of\r\nthe colonies. It would have been a lasting grief to Fauquier had he\r\nlived to see the final separation of mother country and colonies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _The writings of Thomas Jefferson_, ed. A. A.

The unrest in the colony had convinced the Privy Council that\r\nthe government \"should no longer be administered by a substitute.\" So\r\nwhen Sir Jeffrey Amherst declined \"going over to America,\" it was\r\ndecided to appoint one who would go. For the first time since the death\r\nof Nott, Virginia had a resident Governor General. The people of the\r\ncolony regarded this as a singular honor. When Botetourt arrived in\r\nWilliamsburg, he found the members of the Council, the Speaker of the\r\nHouse, the Attorney General, and other prominent men waiting to receive\r\nhim at the gate of the Capitol yard. After they had gone in to the\r\nCouncil Chamber, where the new Governor administered the oath, they\r\nstepped over to the Raleigh Tavern for supper. Then Botetourt was\r\nescorted to the Palace through the illuminated Duke of Gloucester Street\r\nand the Palace Green.[1]\r\n\r\nIf the British Government had hoped to please the people of Virginia in\r\nsending them a Governor General, they were not disappointed. \"All ranks\r\nvied with each other in testifying their gratitude and joy that a\r\nnobleman of such distinguished merit and abilities is appointed to\r\npreside over and live among them.\"[2] But it was not so much his rank as\r\nhis personality which won all hearts. He was easily accessible, affable\r\nto the humblest visitor, sympathetic with the people's grievances.\r\n\r\nThe new Governor was at once confronted with grave issues. In May, 1767,\r\nCharles Townshend had secured an act of Parliament placing duties on\r\nglass, lead, painters' colors, and tea imported into the colonies. It\r\nwas expressly stated that the revenue was to be used to pay the salaries\r\nof British officials in America. Another act was passed to enforce the\r\ntrade laws, and still another to suspend the New York Assembly for its\r\ndefiance of the Billeting Act.\r\n\r\nAgain all America seethed. It is obvious, men told each other, that the\r\nBritish Government will not be content until they have made slaves of\r\nus. At first they claimed that they were seeking nothing more of us than\r\na revenue. Now they openly avow that these new duties are to be used to\r\nmake British officials in America independent of the Assemblies. That\r\nwould be the final triumph of royal authority.\r\n\r\nSo when Botetourt dissolved the old Assembly and called for a new\r\nelection, the people selected their ablest and most patriotic men. Among\r\nthem were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Richard\r\nHenry Lee, Henry Lee, and Edmund Pendleton. When they met, in May, 1769,\r\nGovernor Botetourt entered an elegant coach which had been presented to\r\nhim by King George III, on it the insignia of royalty, drawn by six\r\nmilk-white horses, and drove from the Palace to the Capitol. After the\r\nusual address to the Assembly and the replies of the Council and the\r\nBurgesses, Botetourt entertained many of the members at dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the previous February the Governor had written the Lords of Trade\r\nwarning them of the temper of the people. \"I must not venture to flatter\r\nyour Lordships that they will ever willingly submit to being taxed by\r\nthe mother country. The reverse is their creed. They universally avow a\r\nmost ardent desire to assist upon every occasion, but pray to be allowed\r\nto do it in consequence of requisition.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIt seems strange, then, that he should have been surprised to hear that\r\nthe Burgesses had passed several resolutions asserting the rights of the\r\npeople. They declared that the sole right of imposing taxes \"is now, and\r\never hath been\" constitutionally vested in the House of Burgesses; that\r\nthe people have the right to petition the sovereign for redress of\r\ngrievances; and that trials for crimes committed in the colony should be\r\ntried in the Virginia courts.[4]\r\n\r\nThe next day the Governor summoned the Council and Burgesses to the\r\nCouncil Chamber, where he said he had heard of the resolutions, that he\r\npredicted they would have an ill effect, and that according to his duty,\r\nhe dissolved them.\r\n\r\nBut the Burgesses would not be silenced. Filing out of the Capitol, they\r\nwent to the nearby Raleigh Tavern for an unofficial session. After they\r\nhad elected Peyton Randolph moderator, they discussed the serious\r\nproblems facing the colony. They then appointed a committee to draw up a\r\nplan for an association, and adjourned until the next day.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee, which was signed by eighty-eight men is a\r\ndocument of the greatest importance in the history of the clash between\r\nthe American colonies and Great Britain. It spoke of the \"grievances and\r\ndistresses\" with which the people were oppressed, of the evils which\r\nthreatened their ruin and the ruin of their posterity by reducing them\r\n\"from a free and happy people to a wretched and miserable state of\r\nslavery.\" They denounced \"the restrictions, prohibitions, and\r\nill-advised regulations in several late acts of Parliament,\" and\r\ndeclared that the \"unconstitutional act imposing duties on tea, paper,\r\nglass, etc. for the sole purpose of raising a revenue in America is\r\ninjurious to property, and destructive to liberty.\"[5] Those who signed\r\nthe association promised to discourage luxury and extravagance, agreed\r\nnot to import goods taxed by Parliament or any of a long list of\r\ncommodities, until the hated duties were removed.\r\n\r\nAfter all had affixed their signatures, they gathered around the punch\r\nbowl to drink a series of toasts--to the King, the Queen and the Royal\r\nFamily, Lord Botetourt, A Speedy and lasting Union between Great Britain\r\nand her Colonies, The Constitutional British Liberty in America and all\r\ntrue Patriots, the Supporters thereof, the Duke of Richmond, the Earl of\r\nShelburne, Colonel Barre, the late Speaker, etc. At last, either because\r\nthe liquor or the toasts gave out, the meeting came to an end.[6]\r\n\r\nIt was while the Assembly was in session that Secretary Hillsborough\r\nwrote Botetourt assuring him that the King's ministers would soon\r\npropose the repeal of the obnoxious duties. Whereupon the Governor\r\ncalled an Assembly and laid the joyous news before them. But the\r\nBurgesses must have seen the joker in the announcement when they noted\r\nthat the repeal would be based, not on any illegality in the duties, but\r\non the fact that they had been laid \"contrary to the true principles of\r\ncommerce.\"[7]\r\n\r\nYet Botetourt was all optimism. \"I will be content to be declared\r\ninfamous if I do not to the last hour of my life ... exert every power\r\nwith which I am or ever shall be legally invested ... to obtain and\r\nmaintain for the continent of America that satisfaction which I have\r\nbeen authorized to promise by the confidential servant of our gracious\r\nsovereign.\" Some months later, when the Virginians learned just how the\r\nMinistry had carried out this promise, Botetourt had reason to think\r\nthat he had been led into deceiving them. It is true that all the duties\r\nhad been taken off save that on tea. But so far from considering this a\r\nfavor, the colonists resented it as a bait to make them acknowledge the\r\nright of Parliament to tax them. The resentment of the people was all\r\nthe greater because of their disappointment. Hillsborough's promise had\r\nmade them lax in enforcing the association, so in June, 1770, they\r\norganized a new one. A long list of imported goods were to be boycotted,\r\nindustry was to be encouraged, prices were not to be advanced. To see\r\nthat the agreement was carried out committees were to be organized in\r\nevery county to examine invoices and expose violators.\r\n\r\nIt was unfortunate for Virginia that Botetourt's administration was\r\nshort. He died October 15, 1770. \"Truly and justly to express the many\r\ngreat virtues and amiable qualities which adorned this noble lord, as\r\nwell in his public as private character, would demand the skill of the\r\nablest penman,\" stated the death notice in the _Gazette_. \"Virginia, in\r\nhis fall, sorely laments the loss of the best of Governors and the best\r\nof men.\"[8]\r\n\r\nA few days later a sorrowful procession moved from the Palace to Bruton\r\nParish Church, amid the tolling of the bells in the church, the college,\r\nand the Capitol. In front of and beside the hearse were eight mourners\r\ncarrying staffs draped in black, around them were the pallbearers--six\r\nCouncillors and the Speaker of the House. Then followed the Governor's\r\nservants, the clergy, the professors of the college, the Williamsburg\r\nofficials preceded by the city mace, and many others, all having white\r\nhatbands and gloves. After the service in the church the procession\r\nmoved to the Wren Building where the lead casket, covered with a crimson\r\nvelvet cloth, was placed in a vault below the floor of the chapel.[9]\r\n\r\nAs a token of affection the Assembly employed Richard Hayward, of\r\nLondon, to make a marble statue of Botetourt, which arrived in 1773 and\r\nwas set up in the piazza of the Capitol. Later it was mutilated by a\r\ncrowd of vandals as an expression of their hostility to all things\r\nBritish. In 1801 the College of William and Mary acquired it and removed\r\nit to the campus in front of the Wren Building, where it stands today an\r\nobject of veneration for faculty, students, and alumni.\r\n\r\nThe grief of the people at the loss of Botetourt would have been all the\r\ngreater had they known who was to be his successor. At the time John\r\nMurray, Earl of Dunmore, was Governor of New York, where he was regarded\r\nwith contempt. At a feast of the Sons of St. Andrew he got drunk, acted\r\nlike \"a damned fool,\" and \"sank himself\" so low with vile language that\r\nthe entire company was abashed. When word reached him that he was to be\r\ntransferred to Virginia, he expressed resentment. \"Damn Virginia!\" he\r\ncried. \"Why is it forced on me? I asked for New York. New York I love\r\nand they have robbed me of it.\" At a farewell dinner given in his honor,\r\n\"he took too cheerful a glass,\" and got into a fight.[10]\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia were probably not aware of Dunmore's character,\r\nfor they greeted him cordially upon his arrival in Williamsburg, late in\r\nSeptember, 1771. In the evening the city was illuminated, with a candle\r\nin every window, as a testimony of joy at his Excellency's safe\r\narrival.[11]\r\n\r\nThe time was auspicious, for there was a lull in the controversy with\r\nthe mother country. Though the duty on tea had not been removed, there\r\nwas general hope that all differences could be adjusted. It is true that\r\nDunmore aroused suspicion by trying to create new fees with which to pay\r\nhis secretary, but his promptness in relinquishing them soon dissipated\r\nit. \"A ball and elegant entertainment\" at the Capitol given by the\r\nBurgesses in his honor testified to a spirit of cordiality.\r\n\r\nIt was just this lull which alarmed some of the younger leaders in\r\nVirginia. As long as the tax on tea remained they realized that the\r\ndanger to liberty persisted. So when the Assembly met in the spring of\r\n1773, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, and others\r\nheld private consultations in the Raleigh Tavern on how to awaken the\r\npeople, not only of Virginia, but of all the colonies, to the need of a\r\ncommon defense.[12]\r\n\r\nA momentous series of meetings they proved to be, for out of them came\r\nthe intercolonial system of committees of correspondence and the\r\nContinental Congress. \"We were all sensible that the most urgent of all\r\nmeasures was that of coming to an understanding with all the other\r\ncolonies to consider the British claims as a common cause to all, and to\r\nproduce a unity of action,\" Jefferson stated afterward. \"And for this\r\npurpose that a committee of correspondence in each colony would be the\r\nbest instrument for intercommunication. And that their first measure\r\nwould probably be to propose a meeting of deputies from every colony, at\r\nsome central place, who should be charged with the direction of the\r\nmeasures to be taken by all.\"[13]\r\n\r\nOn March 13, the resolution to appoint the committee of correspondence\r\nfor Virginia was introduced in the House of Burgesses by Dabney Carr,\r\nand adopted unanimously. To the committee were appointed some of the\r\nfirst men in the colony--Peyton Randolph, Thomas Jefferson, Richard\r\nHenry Lee, Patrick Henry, Edmund Pendleton, etc.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lee, writing from London, said that this action \"struck a\r\ngreater panic into the Ministers\" than anything since the passage of the\r\nStamp Act. And well it might, for soon the entire country was covered\r\nwith committees, who kept in close touch with each other, formulated\r\npublic opinion, and prepared the way for revolutionary action.\r\n\r\nThe need for these bodies became glaringly evident when the British\r\nGovernment adopted a policy of repression which aroused the spirit of\r\nresistance to the highest pitch. At the time the East India Company was\r\non the verge of bankruptcy. In order to save it the government agreed to\r\nremit the long-standing duty of twelve pence a pound on tea entering\r\nGreat Britain. When the tea was re-exported to America the price, even\r\nafter the three pence duty there had been paid, would be nine pence less\r\nthan formerly. George III approved of the plan heartily, and confidently\r\nexpected the colonists to swallow the pill of Parliamentary taxation,\r\nnow that it was coated with the sugar of reduced prices.\r\n\r\nNever was a man more mistaken. The Americans, after struggling for a\r\ncentury and a half to win liberty, were not going to sell it for a cup\r\nof tea. When the East India Company ships arrived, angry mobs forced\r\nsome to turn back with their cargoes, some were boarded and the tea\r\ndestroyed. When the brigantine _Mary and Jane_ arrived in Norfolk with\r\nnine chests of tea, a crowded meeting at the courthouse demanded that\r\nthey be sent back. When the importers complied they received a vote of\r\nthanks.[14] The York County committee, headed by Thomas Nelson, debated\r\nwhether a ship which came in with two chests of tea should not be burnt,\r\nbut contented themselves with forcing her to leave without the expected\r\ncargo of tobacco.\r\n\r\nTea was banned in every patriotic household. One evening at Nomini Hall,\r\nMrs. Robert Carter made \"a dish of tea\" for her husband. \"He smelt,\r\nsipt, looked.\" \"What is this?\" he asked. Then \"splash\" he emptied the\r\ncup in the fire.[15] But what chiefly aroused the ire of the British\r\nMinistry was the so-called Boston Tea Party, when fifty or sixty men,\r\ndisguised as Indians, boarded the tea ships and threw box after box in\r\nthe harbor, while a large crowd looked on and applauded.\r\n\r\nThis provoked the British Government into making their most serious\r\nblunder--the passage of what the Americans called the \"Intolerable\r\nActs.\" The port of Boston was closed; the Massachusetts government was\r\naltered to increase the power of the Governor; in certain cases accused\r\npersons might be sent to England for trial; the Governors were\r\nauthorized to requisition buildings for the use of royal troops; the\r\nboundaries of the province of Quebec were extended to the Mississippi on\r\nthe west and the Ohio on the south.\r\n\r\nThe American patriots now realized that they must act with vigor and\r\nfirmness or lose all that they held most dear. The King and Parliament\r\nwere determined to force the issue. When the Virginia Assembly met in\r\nMay, 1774, Henry, Jefferson, Richard Henry Lee, and several others met\r\nin the Council Chamber in the Capitol to agree on some measure to arouse\r\nthe people to a sense of the danger. After some discussion it was\r\ndecided to propose to the Burgesses that they make June 1, the date set\r\nfor the closing of the port of Boston, a day of general fasting and\r\nprayer. The resolution was introduced by Robert Carter Nicholas, and\r\npassed without opposition.[16]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Lord Dunmore. From the copy in the possession of the\r\n    Virginia Historical Society of the original portrait by Sir Joshua\r\n    Reynolds.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Governor's Palace, Williamsburg. Courtesy of\r\n    Colonial Williamsburg, Inc.]\r\n\r\nThe resolution stated that it was necessary to have a day of \"fasting,\r\nhumiliation, and prayer, devoutly to implore the divine interposition\r\nfor averting the heavy calamity which threatens destruction to our civil\r\nrights, and the evils of civil war; to give us one heart and mind firmly\r\nto oppose, by all just and proper means, every injury to American\r\nrights; and that the minds of his Majesty and his Parliament may be\r\ninspired from above with wisdom, moderation, and justice to remove from\r\nthe loyal people of America all cause of danger from a continued pursuit\r\nof measures pregnant with ruin.\" Dunmore thought the resolution\r\nreflected on the King and Parliament, and so made it necessary for him\r\nto dissolve the Assembly.[17]\r\n\r\nBut on June 1, in all parts of Virginia, the people dropped their daily\r\ntasks to assemble in the churches. Every face reflected the universal\r\nalarm, as the eastern aristocrat, the frontiersman in his buckskin\r\nclothes, the great landholder, and the small planter knelt in prayer. In\r\nWilliamsburg the citizens and as many of the Burgesses as had remained\r\nin town, assembled at the courthouse and moved in solemn procession to\r\nthe church to listen to a sermon by the chaplain of the House.[18] There\r\nhad been no such solemn occasion since the French and Indian War, and it\r\ncame as an electric shock to the people.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, events of great importance were taking place in\r\nWilliamsburg. When Dunmore dissolved the Assembly, the Burgesses,\r\ninstead of dispersing, met as they had done five years before in the\r\nRaleigh Tavern. Here, as they sat in the beautiful Apollo Room, they\r\nrenewed the association to boycott English goods; proposed to the\r\ncommittees of correspondence in every colony that they appoint deputies\r\nto a continental Congress; and suggested that each county in Virginia\r\nshould elect representatives to a convention to meet at Williamsburg on\r\nAugust 1.[20]\r\n\r\nDespite their revolutionary activities, the members of the Assembly\r\nmaintained cordial relations with the Governor. When Lady Dunmore joined\r\nher husband earlier in the spring, she was greeted with cheers by the\r\npeople of Williamsburg. On May 26, the Burgesses gave a ball and\r\nentertainment in the Capitol in her honor. My lady seems to have been a\r\nmost graceful dancer. When she and the Governor visited Norfolk where a\r\nball was given them, the city authorities sent to Princess Anne County\r\nfor Colonel Moseley to come \"with his famous wig and shining buckles\" to\r\ndance the minuet with her. So when the fiddles struck up away she went\r\n\"sailing about the room in her great, fine hoop-petticoat, and Colonel\r\nMoseley after her wig and all.\"[21]\r\n\r\nMost of the Burgesses of the Assembly of 1774 had hardly rested from\r\ntheir journey home when they had to repack their saddlebags, mount their\r\nhorses, and set out again for Williamsburg to attend the provincial\r\nconvention. When they had assembled they once more renewed the\r\nassociation, and then proceeded to the election of delegates to the\r\nContinental Congress. Randolph was chosen because it was thought he\r\nwould preside, Washington because he might be called on to command the\r\narmy, Henry and Richard Henry Lee because of their eloquence, Bland,\r\nHarrison, and Pendleton because of their ability as political leaders.\r\n\r\nAs these men turned their faces toward Philadelphia, their minds must\r\nhave reverted to the series of violations of the rights of the people\r\nwhich had brought on the crisis. The questions George Washington asked\r\nhimself no doubt were in the minds of all. \"Does it not appear as clear\r\nas the sun in its meridian brightness that there is a regular,\r\nsystematic plan formed to fix the right and practice of taxation upon\r\nus?... Does not the uniform conduct of Parliament for some years past\r\nconfirm this?... Is not the attack upon the liberty and property of the\r\npeople of Boston ... a plain and self-evident proof of what they are\r\naiming at? Do not subsequent bills ... convince us that the\r\nadministration is determined to stick at nothing to carry its\r\npoint?\"[22]\r\n\r\nCongress met in the \"plain and spacious rooms\" on the lower floor of\r\nCarpenter's Hall which had been completed four years before. After some\r\ndebate they adopted a Declaration of Rights and Grievances, stating the\r\nAmerican case against taxation without representation and demanding the\r\nrepeal of the \"unpolitic, unjust, cruel, and unconstitutional\"\r\nIntolerable Acts. They then framed a \"Continental Association\" to be\r\nenforced by local committees.\r\n\r\nThe Association proved remarkably successful. To this Dunmore himself\r\nbore testimony. To the Earl of Hillsborough he wrote in December, 1774:\r\n\"The Associations ... recommended by the people of this colony, and\r\nadopted by what is called the Continental Congress, are now enforcing\r\nthroughout this country with the greatest rigor. A committee has been\r\nchosen in every county whose business it is to carry the Association of\r\nthe Congress into execution, which committee assumes an authority to\r\ninspect the books, invoices, and all the secrets of the trade and\r\ncorrespondence of the merchants, to watch the conduct of every\r\ninhabitant without distinction, and send for all such as come under\r\ntheir suspicion into their presence, to interrogate them ...and to\r\nstigmatize, as they term it, such as they find transgressing what they\r\nare hardy enough to call the laws of Congress.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe American patriots were greatly encouraged by the support they\r\nreceived from many of the ablest men in Great Britain. These men were\r\nshocked at the disregard by Parliament of the principle that no man\r\nshould be taxed without his own consent. Pitt declared that if America\r\nfell the British Constitution would fall with her. When troops were sent\r\nto Boston, the Duke of Richmond blurted out: \"I hope from the bottom of\r\nmy heart that the Americans may resist and get the better of the forces\r\nsent against them.\"\r\n\r\nToday one wonders how the King and Parliament could have turned a deaf\r\near to the ringing words of Edmund Burke in his famous address on\r\n\"Conciliation with the Colonies.\" \"As long as you have the wisdom to\r\nkeep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of\r\nliberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the\r\nchosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their\r\nfaces toward you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will\r\nhave; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be\r\ntheir obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere--it is a seed that grows\r\nin every soil.... But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true\r\ninterest and your national dignity, freedom they can have from none but\r\nyou.... Deny them this participation of freedom, and you break that sole\r\nbond which originally made, and must still preserve, the unity of the\r\nEmpire.... It is the spirit of the English Constitution which, infused\r\nthrough the mighty mass, pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies\r\nevery part of the Empire, even down to the minutest members.\"[24]\r\n\r\nIn the revolutionary changes in Virginia it was the House of Burgesses,\r\nnot the Council, who took the lead. Washington, Henry, Jefferson,\r\nPendleton, Richard Henry Lee, George Mason were all Burgesses. In fact\r\nthe members of the Council were placed in a most embarrassing position.\r\nAppointed by the King to aid and advise the royal Governor, they owed a\r\ndouble allegiance--to Crown and country. To them the breach was a\r\ntragedy, the choice of allegiance a difficult one. So for the most part\r\nthey played a negative role. In the Council meetings they usually voted\r\nwith the Governor. But as the crisis grew more acute they drifted away\r\nfrom him to join their countrymen in resisting the assaults on their\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nJohn Page, Junior, in Council supported Dunmore in dissolving the\r\nAssembly in May, 1774; yet he remained in town and joined the Burgesses\r\nin the procession to the church on the fast day.[25] On the other hand,\r\nRobert Carter, though he had refused to drink a cup of tea, would not\r\npermit any of his family to observe the day. \"By this I conclude he is a\r\ncourtier,\" wrote Fithian in his _Diary_. But he did not long remain a\r\n\"courtier.\" \"The enemies of government are so numerous and so vigilant\r\nover the conduct of every man that the loyalists have been so\r\nintimidated that they have entirely shrunk away,\" wrote Dunmore in July,\r\n1775. \"Even the Council ... approves everything done by the Burgesses.\"\r\nThe only members he could rely upon were Ralph Wormeley, Gawin Corbin,\r\nand the Reverend John Camm.[26] The rest, while not subscribing to the\r\nAssociation, adhered strictly to it.\r\n\r\nBut John Randolph, the Attorney General, remained faithful to the King\r\nto the end. His opposition to the resolutions denouncing the Stamp Act,\r\nthe boycott, and the calling of the provincial and Continental\r\nCongresses brought down on him the wrath of the patriots. Dunmore stated\r\nthat he was insulted, his life threatened, and his home destroyed.[27]\r\nIn 1775 he sailed for England with his family, never to return.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1774 Dunmore brought on himself the hatred of the\r\nVirginia frontiersmen by his conduct in a war with the western Indians.\r\nPlacing himself in command of one force, and General Andrew Lewis of\r\nanother, he gave the order to advance. Lewis defeated the famous chief\r\nComstock in the bloody battle of Point Pleasant, but Dunmore, ignoring\r\nthe chance to deliver a crushing blow, made a treaty of peace with the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThe frontiersmen, as they turned their faces homeward, cursed the\r\nGovernor as a traitor, who spared the Indians because he planned to use\r\nthem against the Virginians should they go to war with Great Britain.\r\nNor were their suspicions groundless, for a few months later Dunmore\r\nwrote the Earl of Dartmouth that if the King would send him \"a small\r\nbody of troops\" and arms and ammunition, he could raise \"such a force\r\namong Indians, Negroes, and other persons\" as would soon reduce Virginia\r\nto obedience.[28]\r\n\r\nBut at this moment obedience was far from the minds of the people. On\r\nMarch 20, 1775, the second Provincial Congress met in St. John's Church,\r\nRichmond. The place was but a straggling village, but it was more\r\ncentrally located than Williamsburg, and further away from the British\r\nwarships in the York River. The delegates were unanimous in approving\r\nthe proceedings of the Continental Congress, and in thanking the\r\nVirginia representatives for their services. But it soon became evident\r\nthat they were divided on the vital question of preparing for war. When\r\nHenry introduced resolutions for putting the colony in a state of\r\ndefense by arming and disciplining a force of militia, some of the\r\nleading members drew back. War was unthinkable, they said. The country\r\nwas too weak, too defenseless, too open to invasion. The only hope was\r\nfor reconciliation, for the mediation of America's friends in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThis brought Henry to his feet. \"What has there been in the conduct of\r\nthe British Ministry for the last ten years to justify hope? Are fleets\r\nand armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? These are the\r\ninstruments of subjugation sent over to rivet upon us the chains which\r\nthe British Ministry have been so long forging. What have we to oppose\r\nthem? Shall we try argument? We have been trying that for the last ten\r\nyears.... Shall we resort to entreaty and supplication? We have\r\npetitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated; and we have been\r\nspurned from the foot of the throne.... If we wish to be free we must\r\nfight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight!... Is life so dear or peace so\r\nsweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it,\r\nAlmighty God. I know not what course others may take, but as for me,\r\ngive me liberty or give me death.\"[29] Henry's eloquence carried the\r\nday, yet so fraught with danger was the issue, that his motion was\r\ncarried by a majority of five only.\r\n\r\nA few days later Dunmore wrote to Dartmouth denouncing the proceedings\r\nof the Convention. \"The most dangerous, as well as the most daring\r\nattempt is the resolution which is adopted for raising a body of armed\r\nmen, horse and foot as well. The plan for imbodying, arming, and\r\ndisciplining of which is by these resolutions published as the final\r\norder for putting the same into execution.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost overnight Virginia was converted into an armed camp. Everywhere\r\nthere was the sound of drums, the sharp commands of drillmasters,\r\nmarching and countermarching. Even in Williamsburg the streets were full\r\nof men with arms in their hands. In the Valley of Virginia, Fithian\r\njotted down in his _Diary_ on June 6: \"Here every presence is warlike,\r\nevery sound is martial! Drums beating, fifes and bagpipes playing....\r\nEvery man had a hunting-shirt, which is the uniform of each company.\r\nAlmost all have a cockade and bucktail in their hats to represent that\r\nthey are hardy, resolute, and invincible natives of the woods of\r\nAmerica.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThese warlike preparations drove Dunmore to take a step, which aroused\r\nthe fury of the patriots. In Williamsburg there still stands a little\r\noctagonal building which was used as a magazine in colonial days. Here\r\nwere stored twenty barrels of powder and several guns. To keep the\r\nindependent companies from seizing the powder the Governor ordered a\r\nparty of sailors to take it on board an armed schooner nearby in the\r\nJames River. Before daybreak, on April 20, they made off with most of\r\nit, and it was later put on board the _Fowey_ man-of-war.[31]\r\n\r\nDespite the gloom of early dawn the removal of the powder was observed,\r\nand the beating of drums gave the alarm. The independent companies got\r\nunder arms, the people assembled, and the Governor was threatened with\r\nviolence unless he returned the powder. The mayor and other city\r\nofficers, leaving the troops nearby, went to the Palace with an address\r\nwhich Dunmore thought amounted to a peremptory demand for the powder.\r\nShould he refuse they could not answer for the dreadful consequences.\r\n\r\nThe Governor not only refused, but prepared to resist any attack with\r\nthe aid of several British officers and a few men from the warships. Had\r\nnot Peyton Randolph and Robert Carter Nicholas persuaded the angry\r\ntroops to disperse, the war in Virginia would have begun with an assault\r\non the Palace. As it was, parties of armed men continued to pour into\r\nWilliamsburg, and word came that several hundred cavalry were at\r\nFredericksburg, ready to march, and that Patrick Henry was leading a\r\nforce up from the south. In alarm the Governor sent Lady Dunmore and his\r\nchildren to one of the warships, and threatened to arm the slaves and\r\nreduce Williamsburg to ashes.[32]\r\n\r\nThe more conservative leaders among the Virginians, who were still\r\nhoping for a compromise with Great Britain, were able, though with great\r\ndifficulty, to restrain the troops. At Fredericksburg the men pledged\r\nthemselves to be in readiness at a moment's notice to defend the laws,\r\nthe liberties, and the rights of Virginia and any sister colony, and\r\nthen dispersed.[33] Henry's force got within fifteen miles of\r\nWilliamsburg, and halted only when Richard Corbin, the Receiver General,\r\npaid for the powder from the royal funds by handing him a bill of\r\nexchange for L330.\r\n\r\nFate decreed that hostilities should begin, not in Virginia, but in\r\nMassachusetts. The Virginia delegates were just preparing to leave for\r\nthe second Continental Congress when the news of the skirmish at\r\nLexington and Concord arrived. New England was already at war. The\r\nquestion in everyone's mind was, would the rest of the country follow?\r\nWashington's answer was to wear his military uniform. Along the road he\r\nand the other Virginia delegates were cheered on by crowds of\r\nenthusiastic people, amid the blaring of bands and the firing of guns.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that some of the conservative members of Congress\r\nprevented a declaration of independence. And though a petition to the\r\nKing was agreed on, the taking over of the New England army around\r\nBoston and appointing Washington commander in chief, was in effect a\r\ndeclaration of war. Yet, as Washington was leaving for the east to draw\r\nthe sword, Pendleton returned to Virginia to resume his post as Speaker\r\nin a last attempt to re-establish the old government.\r\n\r\nHe was welcomed to Williamsburg like a conquering hero. A detachment of\r\ncavalry met him at the Pamunkey River and escorted him the rest of the\r\nway. Two miles from the city they were joined by a company of infantry.\r\nAt sunset, as they entered Williamsburg, they were received by the\r\nringing of bells and the cheers of the crowds in the streets. At dark\r\nevery house was illuminated.\r\n\r\nDunmore thought \"this pompous military exhibition\" had been planned \"to\r\nraise the importance of the members of this new created power, the\r\nCongress, before the people.\" And the \"appearance of numbers of the\r\nBurgesses in the clothes of the American troops, wearing a shirt of\r\ncoarse linen or canvas over their clothes and a tomahawk by their\r\nsides,\" added fuel to the fire.[34]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly had been in session but three days when several overzealous\r\nyoung men broke into the magazine to take out some of the arms. They\r\nstumbled against a cord which had been attached to a gun pointed at the\r\nentrance, which went off wounding two of them. This aroused the people\r\nto action, and the next day at noon an angry crowd, among them several\r\nBurgesses, entered the magazine and carried off about 400 stand of arms.\r\nA committee of the House of Burgesses persuaded the people to return the\r\narms, and then set a military guard around the magazine. \"So the custody\r\nof the magazine and public stores is thus wrested out of the hands of\r\nthe Governor,\" complained Dunmore.[35]\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Assembly the Governor began by urging the\r\nacceptance of the resolutions which Lord North had pushed through\r\nParliament in February, as the basis for reconciliation. These\r\nresolutions promised that if any colony would raise of its own authority\r\nthe cost of its own government, Parliament would not tax that colony. In\r\nother words, if the Americans guaranteed to pay into the hands of the\r\nKing's Governors funds sufficient to make them independent of the\r\nAssemblies, Parliament would not take their money from them to do so.\r\nThe Burgesses must have been indignant when Dunmore told them that he\r\nhad strong hopes a consideration of this offer would bring to an end the\r\ndisputes with the mother country.[36]\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Burgesses, which was almost certainly written by\r\nJefferson, is notable because of the clearness with which it exposed the\r\nunconstitutionally of the British position. They had viewed the proposal\r\nwith pain and disappointment, for it merely changed the form of\r\noppression without lightening its burden. \"The British government has no\r\nright to intermeddle with the support of civil government in the\r\ncolonies. For us, not for them, has government been instituted here....\r\nWe cannot conceive that any other legislature has a right to prescribe\r\neither the number or pecuniary appointment of our officers.\" The claim\r\nof Parliament of the right to tax the people of the colony had no\r\nprecedent. Even the act of 1680 giving the King a perpetual revenue was\r\npassed, not by Parliament, but by his Majesty \"with the consent of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe Burgesses were not willing to purchase exemption from an unjust\r\ntaxation by saddling the people with a perpetual tax to be disposed of\r\nby the King or Parliament. \"We have a right to give our money as the\r\nParliament does theirs, without coercion.... It is not merely the mode\r\nof raising, but the freedom of granting our money for which we have\r\ncontended, without which we possess no check on the royal prerogative.\"\r\n\r\nUpon receiving assurance that no harm was intended his family, Dunmore\r\nhad brought them back to the Palace. But on June 8, before daybreak, he,\r\nLady Dunmore, the children, his secretary, and some of the servants\r\nstole out and went on board the _Fowey_. \"My house was kept in continued\r\nalarm and threatened every night with an assault,\" Dunmore explained.\r\n\"Surrounded as I was by armed men ... and situated so far from any place\r\nwhere men-of-war can approach, ... I could not think it safe to continue\r\nin that city.\"[38]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly urged the Governor to return, but he refused. So on the\r\nnight of June 24, a large body of men forced their way into the Palace\r\nby bursting open a window, and carried off several hundred stand of arms\r\nwhich had been kept in the hall. Some days later another group entered\r\nthe building, went from room to room breaking into cabinets, and\r\ncarried off arms of various sorts.[39]\r\n\r\nAnd now Williamsburg became an armed camp. Bands of horse and foot, in\r\nuniforms and each company displaying their distinctive badge flocked in.\r\nSome of them lodged in the Capitol, the cavalry encamped on the Palace\r\nGreen.[40] One wonders whether these men knew that a century earlier\r\nNathaniel Bacon had assembled his men on or near this spot, or whether\r\nany of them realized that they had fought for the same cause as they,\r\nthe cause of liberty?\r\n\r\nWith Dunmore on the _Fowey_ and the Assembly in Williamsburg, the\r\nremainder of the session was rather futile. There was renewed bickering\r\nover the removal of the powder, the Burgesses drew up a long address to\r\nthe Governor criticizing his administration, and accusing him of\r\nmisrepresenting conditions in Virginia in one of his letters to the Earl\r\nof Dartmouth. The Assembly adjourned on June 24, until October 12, and\r\non that date, when only thirty-seven members showed up, adjourned again\r\nuntil March 7, 1776. This time less than a fourth of the Burgesses\r\nattended, and immediately adjourned to May 6, when several members met,\r\n\"but did neither proceed to business nor adjourn, as a House of\r\nBurgesses.\" And so died the Virginia Assembly after more than a century\r\nand a half of existence, in which it had fought and won the good battle\r\nfor liberty. It now remained for other bodies to defend and preserve\r\nthat liberty for future generations.[41]\r\n\r\nEven while the Assembly was in session the government, in reality, had\r\npassed into the hands of the conventions and the committees of safety.\r\nAs early as December, 1774, Dunmore wrote that the royal government had\r\nbeen \"entirely overthrown.\" \"There is not a justice of peace in Virginia\r\nthat acts except as a committeeman. The abolishing of the courts of\r\njustice was the first step taken, in which the men of fortune and\r\npre-eminence joined equally with the lowest and meanest. The General\r\nCourt ... is in much the same predicament.\"[42] All that was needed to\r\ntake the government completely out of the hands of the Governor and the\r\nAssembly was an executive head. And this was supplied by the third\r\nconvention which met in Richmond in July, 1775, by the appointment of a\r\n\"general committee of safety.\"\r\n\r\nTo this body were appointed some of the ablest men in the\r\ncolony--Pendleton, George Mason, John Page, Richard Bland, Thomas\r\nLudwell Lee, and others. It was given almost dictatorial powers, for it\r\nhad the supervision of military affairs, appointing officers, collecting\r\nsupplies, and naming paymasters; it corresponded with the county\r\ncommittees, arrested Loyalists, held inquiries.[43]\r\n\r\nThe convention, having created a body to take over the functions\r\nformerly exercised by the Governor and Council, itself practically\r\nreplaced the dying Assembly. It prepared for the defense of the colony\r\nby raising two regular regiments and several thousand minutemen,\r\nreorganizing the militia, and setting up works for the manufacture of\r\narms and powder. It authorized the Treasurer to issue L350,000 of paper\r\nmoney. It levied taxes on tithables, coaches, land, licenses, legal\r\npapers, etc.[44]\r\n\r\nA state of war now existed. If they could have laid hands on Dunmore,\r\nthe patriots no doubt would have kept him in confinement. And on one\r\noccasion he barely escaped. It was in July that he went in a barge to a\r\nfarm which he owned on a creek about seven miles from Williamsburg. He\r\nand Captain Montague, of the _Fowey_, had just finished dinner when the\r\nservants rushed in to warn them that the Americans were coming. They had\r\nbarely time to run to their boat and push off. Two of their men were\r\ncaptured, and another, jumping into a canoe, paddled desperately with\r\nbullets whizzing past his head.[45]\r\n\r\nAs early as May, 1775, Dunmore wrote Dartmouth that he could not\r\nmaintain even an appearance of authority without \"a force to support\r\nit.\" Dartmouth replied that he was sending him 3,000 stand of arms, 200\r\nrounds of powder and ball for each musket, and four light brass cannon.\r\n\"I see that Gage has ordered sent you a detachment of the Fourteenth\r\nRegiment. I hope with the Negroes, Indians, etc., you can reduce\r\nVirginia.... It is the King's firm resolution that the most vigorous\r\nefforts should be made, by sea and land, to reduce his rebellious\r\nsubjects to obedience.\"[46]\r\n\r\nDunmore was soon in control of Virginia waters. The sloop of war _Otter_\r\narrived late in June, the _Mercury_, carrying twenty guns, on July 10,\r\nto be followed by the _Liverpool_, a frigate of twenty-eight guns; the\r\n_Kingfisher_, and the _Dunmore_. But the Governor was never able to\r\nraise a land force capable of contending with the Virginians. With the\r\narrival of seventy men from St. Augustine and one company from Rhode\r\nIsland to add to the marines, he could muster about 200 men. This small\r\nforce he hoped would be a nucleus for an army of Tories and Negroes, and\r\non November 7 he issued a proclamation declaring martial law, summoning\r\nall \"loyal\" citizens to join him, and offering freedom to any slaves who\r\nwould take up arms for the King.[47]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, he had moved with his little fleet into the Elizabeth\r\nRiver. It was necessary for him to find provisions, and he counted upon\r\nthe Scottish merchants of Norfolk and other Tories in the lower counties\r\nto supply him. When the local committee of safety denounced all who sent\r\nfood out to the ships as enemies of liberty, he threatened to bombard\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk printer, John Holt, ignoring the guns of the warships which\r\npointed out over the town, continued to issue his gazette and to urge\r\nthe people not to give up their liberty. On September 30 a party of\r\nBritish rowed ashore, marched to the printing office, and carried off\r\nthe press, the type, the ink, the paper, and two of the printers. As\r\nthey embarked they gave three huzzas, in which a crowd of Negroes\r\njoined. \"I am now going to have a press for the King,\" Dunmore said.[48]\r\n\r\nOn November 16, Dunmore took possession of Norfolk, where he raised the\r\nroyal standard. To his great satisfaction the Scottish merchants and\r\ntheir clerks, some Negroes, and others took the oath. He then began to\r\nfortify the city with earthworks.[49] He would have done better to build\r\nforts at different points on the long, circuitous road by which alone\r\nNorfolk could be approached, between the Dismal Swamp and the heads of\r\nseveral branches of the Elizabeth River. Not until it was too late did\r\nhe fortify Great Bridge where the Southern Branch flowed between two\r\nmarshes, each crossed by a long causeway.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the Virginia troops had been concentrating at\r\nWilliamsburg, under the command of Colonel Woodford. They now crossed\r\nthe James, marched through Suffolk, and headed for the Great Bridge.\r\nMany of the men were from the western counties, and were armed, not with\r\nmuskets, but with rifles. They were deadly shots, as the British soon\r\nfound to their sorrow. When the Virginians reached Great Bridge, the\r\nBritish, instead of waiting for them to attack their almost impregnable\r\nposition, themselves took the initiative. The regulars led the way over\r\nthe causeways and the bridge, followed by the Tories and Negroes.[50]\r\n\"Reserve your fire until they are within fifty yards,\" the Virginia\r\nofficers ordered. Then the shirtmen, aiming as coolly as though they\r\nwere shooting deer, let fly. The regulars were cut to pieces, the Tories\r\nand Negroes refused to fight, so with the coming of darkness the British\r\nleft their posts and streamed back to Norfolk.[51]\r\n\r\nWhen Dunmore heard of this defeat he raved like a madman, and even\r\nthreatened to hang the boy who brought the news. With the shirtmen\r\nadvancing on the city, flight was all that was left him. Soon the\r\nstreets were jammed with panicky soldiers, men, women, and children,\r\nhastening to the wharves to take refuge on the warships or the fleet of\r\nmerchantmen. They were none too soon, for on December 11, the\r\nVirginians, reinforced by a body of North Carolinians under Colonel\r\nHowe, entered the city.\r\n\r\nBut having gained Norfolk, the two commanders now debated what they\r\nshould do with it. If a large force of British attacked it by land and\r\nsea it could not be defended, and the garrison would be captured.[52] On\r\nthe other hand, for the enemy it would be invaluable as a base for\r\nattacks on any point in eastern Maryland, Virginia, or North Carolina.\r\nHowe wrote the Virginia convention, hinting for permission to burn the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nDunmore's folly gave him an excuse for doing so without waiting for a\r\nreply. Food and water were becoming scarce on the crowded ships in the\r\nriver, many of the refugees became ill, several died. So Dunmore\r\nthreatened to bombard the city if the patriots cut off supplies, and\r\nmoved the warships to a position close by. But now the riflemen, firing\r\nfrom warehouses near the wharves, began picking off his men whenever\r\nthey appeared on deck. On the afternoon of January 1, 1776, the warships\r\nopened fire, and several boatloads of soldiers rowed up to the wharves\r\nand set fire to the adjacent buildings.[53]\r\n\r\nIt was a striking evidence of the sacrifices which the colonial\r\nVirginians were willing to make in the cause of liberty that twice they\r\napplied the torch to one of their towns to prevent the enemy from using\r\nit as a base. The burning of Jamestown by Bacon and his men foreshadowed\r\nthe burning of Norfolk by the revolutionary troops a century later.\r\nSeizing upon the fires set by the British as an excuse, the soldiers\r\nwent from house to house to spread the flames. In all nearly nine\r\nhundred houses were destroyed. A month later, by command of the\r\nconvention, the Americans burned down what was left of the city, 416\r\nhouses in all.[54]\r\n\r\nThe burning of Norfolk was a drastic step indeed. All who witnessed the\r\nplight of the people as they trudged along the roads leading out of the\r\ncity to seek refuge in nearby farms must have condemned it as an act of\r\nuseless cruelty. But in the end it probably saved more suffering than it\r\nentailed. Had the city been spared, the British would almost certainly\r\nhave occupied it and held it throughout the remainder of the war, just\r\nas they held New York. It would have been a haven for Tories from all\r\nthe adjacent states, the British would have made it a great naval and\r\nmilitary base, from it expeditions would have been launched up the great\r\nVirginia rivers as Berkeley had launched expeditions from the Eastern\r\nShore.\r\n\r\nSince the Virginians had no fleet of warships capable of driving Dunmore\r\nout of their waters, they decided to starve him out. They even\r\nthreatened to move the entire population of parts of Norfolk and\r\nPrincess Anne Counties to prevent provisions from reaching him. In May\r\nhe gave orders for the fleet to leave the Elizabeth River and proceed to\r\nGwynn's Island, in the Chesapeake Bay, near the mouth of the\r\nRappahannock River. Here he established a camp. But when General Andrew\r\nLewis set up batteries on the mainland and opened fire, the place became\r\nuntenable. One shot struck the _Dunmore_ and wounded the Governor. \"Good\r\nGod! that ever I should come to this!\" he shouted. A few days later his\r\nfleet sailed down the bay and out through the capes. With it went the\r\nlast vestige of British authority in Virginia.[55]\r\n\r\nNow the question of independence was in the minds of all. The small\r\nplanter as he set out his tobacco crop debated it with himself; the\r\nblacksmith talked it over with his client as he shod his horse; it was\r\nthe topic of conversation in the church yard before the sermon began;\r\nthe members of the convention debated it as they rode along the muddy\r\nroads. In May, 1775, Dunmore wrote: \"It is no longer to be doubted that\r\nindependence is the object in view.\"[56] But in this he was wrong. The\r\ncolonists did not want independence. They were Englishmen, most of them,\r\nspeaking the English language, living under English law, attached to\r\nEnglish institutions. They had hardly ceased to speak of England as\r\n\"home.\" They looked to the British navy for protection, they were keenly\r\nalive to their economic dependence upon the mother country, they were\r\nweak and disunited. The colonies went into the war hugging the hope that\r\nthere might yet be reconciliation, with Washington referring to the\r\nBritish soldiers as the Ministerial troops, and the American chaplains,\r\nin public services, praying for the King.\r\n\r\nThe colonies, in taking up arms, sought only to maintain existing\r\nconditions. The King and the Ministry were the real revolutionists, not\r\nthe Americans. It was Washington who wrote in 1769, that \"at a time when\r\nour lordly masters in Great Britain will be satisfied with nothing less\r\nthan the deprivation of American freedom, something should be done to\r\navert the stroke and maintain the liberty which we have derived from our\r\nancestors.\" Washington by no means considered himself a rebel. He was\r\nchampioning the British constitution and American rights under it\r\nagainst the illegal aggressions of a reactionary Ministry.\r\n\r\nBut the war had not been long in progress before the people saw that\r\nthey must preserve their freedom at the bayonet's point, or make abject\r\nsubmission. When, in the summer of 1775, Richard Penn and Arthur Lee\r\nwent to England with the last effort of Congress for reconciliation, the\r\nso-called Olive Branch, they were rebuffed. The King and his Ministers\r\nrefused to see them. While they were in London a proclamation was read\r\nat Palace Yard and Temple Bar by heralds, prohibiting all intercourse\r\nwith the colonies.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the ties of reverence and affection gave way rapidly before\r\nthe anger and bitterness of war. The news that the King was purchasing\r\ntroops from certain German rulers for use against them aroused the\r\nAmericans to fury. Angry men gathered everywhere, in the coffee houses,\r\non the village greens, or around the courthouses to discuss the burning\r\nof Portland in the midst of a Maine winter, or the arming of the slaves\r\nby Dunmore.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Tom Paine's _Common Sense_ made its\r\nappearance. Although this pamphlet was bombastic, radical, and filled\r\nwith absurdities, it fell in with the trend of the day, and so tended to\r\ncrystallize thought in favor of independence. More than 100,000 copies\r\nwere sold, and it was estimated that every third person in the colonies\r\nread it. \"Where, some say, is the King of America? I'll tell you friend.\r\nHe reigns above, and doth not make havoc of mankind like the royal brute\r\nof England. A government of our own is our natural right. Ye who oppose\r\nindependence now, ye know not what ye do: ye are opening a door to\r\neternal tyranny.\"\r\n\r\nReluctantly the leaders of thought in Virginia came to the conclusion\r\nthat the British government was forcing them into independence.\r\nJefferson wrote John Randolph in November, 1775, that he loved the union\r\nwith Great Britain, \"but by the God that made me I will cease to exist\r\nbefore I yield to a connection on such terms as the British Parliament\r\npropose, and in this I think I speak the sentiments of America.\"\r\n\r\nYet the Virginia convention, in August, 1775, had declared: \"We again\r\nand for all, publickly and solemnly declare, before God and the world,\r\nthat we do bear faith and true allegiance to his Majesty George the\r\nThird, our only lawful and rightful King.\"[57]\r\n\r\nBut before the meeting of the convention of May 6, 1776, sentiment had\r\nchanged. Jefferson said that nine out of every ten persons were now for\r\nindependence.[58] In February, Benjamin Harrison had hinted strongly\r\nthat the time was ripe for separation. In January Washington had written\r\nJoseph Reed that \"a few more such flaming arguments\" as Falmouth and\r\nNorfolk would not leave many to oppose a separation. On April 12 John\r\nPage predicted that independence would be voted in the approaching\r\nconvention; two days later Carter Braxton expressed the opinion that\r\nindependence was not only desirable but inevitable; Pendleton, though\r\ngreatly disturbed at the prospect of separation, thought that no other\r\ncourse was possible.\r\n\r\nThere was great excitement in Williamsburg when the delegates arrived to\r\ntake their seats in the Hall of Burgesses for the opening of the\r\nconvention. The crowds which filled the gallery must have pointed out\r\neach distinguished member as he entered--the aged Richard Bland; George\r\nMason, his black hair now showing a touch of gray; Patrick Henry, in the\r\nplain garb he always wore; Richard Henry Lee, who had been called from\r\nCongress by the illness of his wife; James Madison, a small delicate\r\nyoung man, widely known as a scholar and political thinker; Edmund\r\nPendleton, six feet in height, lithe, and handsome; Robert Carter\r\nNicholas, Henry Lee, Edmund Randolph.[59]\r\n\r\nOn the question of independence there were three opinions. Nicholas was\r\nopposed to separation, for he thought there was still hope for\r\nconciliation. Henry wished Congress to establish independence through a\r\ndeclaration. Pendleton argued for a statement by the convention and by\r\nCongress that independence already existed by the action of King and\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn the end Pendleton was directed to prepare a resolution on\r\nindependence. So, on May 15, Thomas Nelson, Junior, rose and read two\r\nresolutions which Pendleton had drawn up:\r\n\r\n     Forasmuch as all the endeavors of the United Colonies, by the most\r\n     decent representations and petitions to the King and Parliament of\r\n     Great Britain to restore peace and security to America under the\r\n     British government, and a reunion with that people upon just and\r\n     liberal terms, instead of a redress of grievances, have produced,\r\n     from an imperious and vindictive administration, increased insult,\r\n     oppression, and a vigorous attempt to effect our total destruction.\r\n     By a late act, all these colonies are declared to be in rebellion,\r\n     and out of the protection of the British Crown; our properties\r\n     subjected to confiscation; our people, when captivated, compelled\r\n     to join in the murder and plunder of their relations and\r\n     countrymen; and all former rapine and oppression of Americans\r\n     declared legal and just. Fleets and armies are raised, and the aid\r\n     of foreign troops engaged to assist in these destructive purposes.\r\n     The King's representative in this colony hath not only withheld all\r\n     the powers of government from operating for our safety, but, having\r\n     retired on board an armed ship, is carrying on a piratical and\r\n     savage war against us, tempting our slaves by every artifice to\r\n     resort to him, and training and employing them against their\r\n     masters. In this state of extreme danger, we have no alternative\r\n     left but an abject submission to the will of those overbearing\r\n     tyrants, or a total separation from the Crown and government of\r\n     Great Britain, uniting and exerting the strength of all America for\r\n     defence, and forming alliances with foreign powers for commerce and\r\n     aid in war: Wherefore, appealing to the SEARCHER OF HEARTS for the\r\n     sincerity of former declarations, expressing our desire to preserve\r\n     the connection with that nation, and that we are driven from that\r\n     inclination by their wicked councils, and the eternal laws of\r\n     self-preservation:\r\n\r\nResolved, unanimously, That the delegates appointed to represent this\r\ncolony in the General Congress, be instructed to propose to that\r\nrespectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent\r\nstates, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon the Crown or\r\nParliament of Great Britain; and that they give the assent of this\r\ncolony to such declaration, and to whatever measures may be thought\r\nproper and necessary by the Congress for forming foreign alliances, and\r\na confederation of the colonies, at such time, and in the manner as to\r\nthem shall seem best; Provided, the power of forming government for, and\r\nthe regulations of the internal concerns of each colony, be left to the\r\nrespective colonial legislatures.\r\n\r\nResolved unanimously, That a committee be appointed to prepare a\r\nDECLARATION OF RIGHTS, and such a plan of government as will be most\r\nlikely to maintain peace and order in this colony, and secure\r\nsubstantial and equal liberty to the people.\r\n\r\nThe people of Virginia everywhere applauded this final breach with Great\r\nBritain. In Williamsburg the \"Union flag of the American states\" was\r\nraised over the Capitol. The troops, under General Lewis, wheeled and\r\nmarched in a nearby grove in the presence of the members of the\r\nCommittee of Safety and of the convention and a crowd of citizens. After\r\nthe resolutions of the convention had been read to the troops, a toast\r\nwas proposed to \"The American Independent States,\" which was drunk to\r\nthe shouts of the crowd and the firing of the artillery. Then followed\r\ntoasts to \"The Grand Congress of the United States and their Respective\r\nLegislatures,\" and to \"General Washington and Victory for the American\r\nArms.\" With coming of night the people illuminated the town amid\r\ndemonstrations of joy \"that the domination of Great Britain was now at\r\nan end.\"[60]\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of the convention were tantamount to a Virginia\r\ndeclaration of independence. Though it was thought wise to act in\r\nconcert with the other colonies, the convention did not wait for\r\nCongress, but proceeded to draw up a constitution for an independent\r\nstate, with Governor, Senate, House of Delegates, and judiciary. One\r\nhundred and sixty-nine years, almost to a day, after Captain Christopher\r\nNewport planted the English flag on the Jamestown peninsula, English\r\nauthority in Virginia was overthrown.\r\n\r\nAs the delegates rode home after the convention had concluded its work,\r\nthe minds of some must have gone over the developments of those\r\nseventeen decades, the heritage of self-government which their ancestors\r\nhad brought with them from England, the struggle to defend their liberty\r\nagainst the assaults of despotic Kings and despotic Governors, the\r\nspirit of self-reliance fostered by life in the New World, and now the\r\nattempts of a reactionary government in Great Britain to turn back the\r\nhands of the clock and deprive them of the rights they had won. It had\r\nbeen James I and Charles I, and even George III who, in their dealings\r\nwith the colonies, had insisted upon \"obedience,\" but the colonists\r\ninsisted upon another word, the word \"liberty.\" Now that they had won\r\nliberty, it remained to be seen whether they could preserve it against\r\nthe attacks of the British armies and navy. And none could foresee that\r\nat Yorktown, but a few miles away, British armed might in America was\r\ndestined to be broken, as its political power had already been broken at\r\nWilliamsburg.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Virginia Gazette_, P. and D., Oct. 27, 1768.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[3] CO5-1332, Feb. 18, 1769.\r\n\r\n[4] _Virginia Gazette_, P. and D., May 18, 1769.\r\n\r\n[5] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[6] CO5-1332, Botetourt to Hillsborough, May 19, 1769.\r\n\r\n[7] _Journals of the House of Burgesses_, 1766-1769: 227.\r\n\r\n[8] _Virginia Gazette_, P. and D.

During\r\nmany months of work in this office the author made more than eight\r\nhundred pages of notes and transcripts which he has used freely in the\r\nwriting of this volume. The notations CO1-3, CO5-1318, etc., in the\r\nfootnotes all refer to the Public Record Office.\r\n\r\nIt is especially fortunate that these documents have been preserved,\r\nsince of the copies left in Virginia, when there were copies, most have\r\nbeen destroyed. Among the scores of manuscript volumes on Virginia in\r\nthe Record Office, thirty-two are devoted to the correspondence of the\r\nBoard of Trade, seventeen to the correspondence of the Secretary of\r\nState, twenty-two to Entry Books, letters, commissions, warrants, etc.,\r\nfor the period from 1680 to the American Revolution alone.\r\n\r\nIn this vast collection are found the instructions to governors;\r\nmemorials concerning the clergy, the revenue, the College of William and\r\nMary; addresses of the Assembly to the Throne; reports of special agents\r\nof the Crown; accusations against governors; nominations to office; the\r\njournals of the Council and of the House of Burgesses.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the nineteenth century William Noel Sainsbury,\r\nAssistant Keeper of the Records, made no less than twenty volumes of\r\nabstracts of these documents, which have been deposited in the Virginia\r\nState Library. They cover the long period from the founding of the\r\ncolony to 1730. The McDonald Papers, also transcribed from the documents\r\nin the Public Record Office, and also deposited in the Virginia State\r\nLibrary, parallel the Sainsbury abstracts, but they are fuller and give\r\nsome papers overlooked by Sainsbury. The author spent the summer of 1908\r\nin Richmond to study these papers, but they merely whetted his desire to\r\nsee the original collection. So June, 1910, found him in the chilly old\r\nbuilding off Chancery Lane, London, immersed in the musty but\r\nfascinating mass of documents.\r\n\r\nVirginia historians today no longer have to make the journey across the\r\nAtlantic, for the United States Government has had transcriptions made\r\nof the papers relating to our colonial history for the Library of\r\nCongress. Moreover, the journals of the House of Burgesses and the\r\njournals of the Council have been published. Many other documents in the\r\nPublic Record Office have been published in part or in full in the\r\n_Calendar of State Papers_, _Colonial Series, America and West Indies_,\r\nand in historical magazines.\r\n\r\nThe Coventry papers relating to Virginia, Barbados, and other colonies,\r\nat Longleat, the magnificent residence of the Marquess of Bath, which\r\nhave been microfilmed by the American Council of Learned Societies,\r\nthrow a flood of light on Virginia history, especially upon Bacon's\r\nRebellion. They contain letters from Bacon to Berkeley, from Berkeley to\r\nBacon, and from Philip Ludwell to Lady Berkeley, reports from the\r\nVirginia agents who were seeking a charter for the colony, Berkeley's\r\naccount of the evacuation of Jamestown, and many other valuable\r\ndocuments. They give new and overwhelming evidence that Bacon and his\r\nfollowers rose in arms, not only to protect the people from the Indians,\r\nbut to right their wrongs under Berkeley's government.\r\n\r\nThe American Council of Learned Societies was also responsible for the\r\nmicrofilming of the Sackville manuscripts belonging to the Earl of\r\nDorset. They contain letters to the British Government from the Virginia\r\nHouse of Burgesses and from the Council in 1631, and throw a gleam of\r\nlight on an obscure period.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Lord Dunmore and Lord Dartmouth, in the British\r\nPublic Record Office, is vital to any account of the early years of the\r\nRevolution in Virginia. In his letters Dunmore reports on the committees\r\nof correspondence, the boycott, the plight of the Tories, his conflict\r\nwith the Assembly, the arming of the patriots, his flight from\r\nWilliamsburg, his seizure of Norfolk, etc. This correspondence is\r\navailable to scholars in microfilm in the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nW. W. Hening (ed.), _The Statutes at Large_ (1809-1823), in thirteen\r\nvolumes, are indispensable to the historian. In addition to the Virginia\r\nlaws it publishes a few extremely important documents.\r\n\r\nThe county records throw light on local government and the use of the\r\npatronage by the governors to control the Assembly. It is unfortunate\r\nthat many documents in the county courthouses were destroyed in the\r\nRevolution and the War between the States. Yet the records of Surry,\r\nYork, Essex, Rappahannock, Accomac, Elizabeth City, and other counties\r\nhave been preserved.\r\n\r\nPeter Force (ed.), _Tracts and Other Papers_ (1836), has many valuable\r\ndocuments relating to early Virginia history. The accounts of Bacon's\r\nRebellion are of especial interest. Edward Arber (ed.), _The Works of\r\nCaptain John Smith_ (1910), is a main source for the founding and early\r\nhistory of Jamestown. But Smith's tendency to glorify himself and the\r\nprobability that he colored his account to further the designs of King\r\nJames I and the court party have caused many historians to distrust much\r\nthat he has written.\r\n\r\nAlexander Brown, _Genesis of the United States_ (1890), gives many\r\ndocuments on early Virginia history which had long been inaccessible to\r\nscholars. Other publications of documents or early histories are Susan\r\nM. Kingsbury (ed.), _The Records of the Virginia Company of London_\r\n(1906-1935); J. C. Hotten (ed.), _Original Lists of Emigrants to\r\nAmerica, 1606-1700_ (1874); _Lower Norfolk County_ Antiquary; Lyon G.\r\nTyler (ed.), _Narratives of Early Virginia_ (1907); Charles M. Andrews\r\n(ed.), _Narratives of Insurrections_ (1915); Clayton C. Hall (ed.),\r\n_Narratives of Early Maryland_ (1910); and Edmund Goldsmid (ed.),\r\n_Hakluyt's_, _The Principal Navigations_ (1885-1890).\r\n\r\nR. A. Brock (ed.), _The Official Records of Robert Dinwiddie_\r\n(1883-1884); while of great value, is incomplete, since many letters in\r\nthe British Public Record Office have been omitted. R. A. Brock (ed.),\r\n_The Original Letters of Alexander Spotswood_ (1882-1885), from the\r\nmanuscript collection in possession of the Virginia Historical Society,\r\nis also far from complete.\r\n\r\nAmong the historical magazines which have published documents relating\r\nto Virginia the most important are _The Virginia Magazine of History and\r\nBiography_, _William and Mary College Quarterly_, _Tyler's Quarterly\r\nHistorical and Genealogical Magazine_, and the _Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety, Proceedings_.\r\n\r\nThree narratives, Henry Hartwell, James Blair, and Edward Chilton, _The\r\nPresent State of Virginia and the College_; Robert Beverley, _The\r\nHistory and Present State of Virginia_; and Hugh Jones, _The Present\r\nState of Virginia_, have all the value of primary sources. The Hartwell,\r\nBlair, and Chilton history was written in 1697 and first published by\r\nJohn Wyat at the Rose, in St. Paul's churchyard, London, in 1727. It was\r\nrepublished in 1940, with an able introduction by Hunter D. Farish.\r\nBeverley's volume appeared in 1705, and a new edition was published in\r\n1947. Hugh Jones' history came out in 1724, was reprinted in 1865 in a\r\nlimited edition, and republished in 1956. The last edition, edited by\r\nRichard L. Morton, has a valuable introduction, and more than a hundred\r\npages of illuminating notes.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of histories of Virginia. William Stith, _The History\r\nof the First Discovery and Settlement of Virginia_ (1747), is little\r\nmore than a rehash of Captain John Smith's story. John Burk, _The\r\nHistory of Virginia_ (1822), though more critical, is out of date since\r\nthe author did not have access to a mass of documents now available to\r\nthe historian. The same criticism applies to Charles Campbell, _History\r\nof the Colony and Ancient Dominion of Virginia_ (1860). Henry Howe,\r\n_Historical Collections of Virginia_ (1845), brings together many facts,\r\ntraditions, and biographical sketches. It also gives brief descriptions\r\nof contemporaneous life in the various counties. John Fiske's _Old\r\nVirginia and her Neighbors_ (1900), is interesting, but untrustworthy.\r\nEdward D. Neill, _Early Settlement of Virginia and Virginiola_ (1878),\r\n_The English Colonization of America during the Seventeenth Century_\r\n(1871), _History of the Virginia Company of London_ (1869), _Virginia\r\nVetusta_ (1885), and _Virginia Carolorum_ (1886), are based on primary\r\nsources and are still valuable. John Esten Cooke, _Virginia: A History\r\nof the People_ (1884), is interesting but full of mistakes.\r\n\r\nOther works on early Virginia history are Alexander Brown, _The First\r\nRepublic in America_ (1898), T. J. Wertenbaker, _Virginia under the\r\nStuarts_ (1914); Mary Newton Stanard, _The Story of Virginia's First\r\nCentury_ (1928); Matthew Page Andrews, _The Soul of a Nation_ (1943),\r\nand _Virginia, the Old Dominion_ (1937); William Foote, _Sketches of\r\nVirginia_ (1850); Robert R. Howison, _A History of Virginia_ (1848);\r\nConway W. Sams, _The Conquest of Virginia_ (1924); and Wesley Frank\r\nCraven, _Dissolution of the Virginia Company_ (1932).\r\n\r\nIn 1957 the Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corporation published\r\na series of booklets on seventeenth-century Virginia history under the\r\nable editorship of Dr. Earl G. Swem. Among them are E. G. Swem and John\r\nM. Jennings, _A Selected Bibliography of Virginia_, 1607-1699; William\r\nW. Abbot, _A Virginia Chronology_, 1585-1783; Samuel M. Bemiss (ed.),\r\n_The Three Charters of the Virginia Company of London_; Wesley Frank\r\nCraven, _The Virginia Company of London_; Charles E. Hatch, Jr., _The\r\nFirst Seventeen Years at Jamestown_, 1607-1634; Thomas J. Wertenbaker,\r\n_Bacon's Rebellion_ and _The Government of Virginia in the Seventeenth\r\nCentury_; Richard L. Morton, _Struggle against Tyranny and the Beginning\r\nof a New Era_; Martha W. Hiden, _How Justice Grew_. Dr. Wilcomb E.\r\nWashburn, _Virginia under Charles I and Cromwell_, takes issue with most\r\nVirginia historians by coming to the defense of Governor John Harvey who\r\nwas kicked out of Virginia because of his despotic rule, abuse of the\r\ncourts, and disregard of law.\r\n\r\nAmong the special studies relating to the political history of Virginia\r\nare Philip A. Bruce, _The Institutional History of Virginia_ (1910);\r\nJulian A. C. Chandler, _The History of Suffrage in Virginia_ (1901);\r\nOliver P. Chitwood, _Justice in Colonial Virginia_ (1905); Percy S.\r\nFlippin, _Financial Administration of the Colony of Virginia_ (1915);\r\nArmistead C. Gordon, _The Laws of Bacon's Assembly_ (1914); Albert O.\r\nPorter, _County Government in Virginia_ (1947); Mary N. Stanard, _The\r\nStory of Bacon's Rebellion_ (1907); R. T. Barton, _Colonial Decisions_\r\n(1909); Edward Ingle, _Virginia Local Institutions_ (1885); Elmer I.\r\nMiller, _The Legislature of the Province of Virginia_ (1907); Lyon G.\r\nTyler, _The Cradle of the Republic_ (1906); Moncure D. Conway, _Omitted\r\nChapters_ (1888); H. J. Eckenrode, _The Revolution in Virginia_ (1916);\r\nHugh Blair Grigsby, _The Virginia Convention of 1776_ (1855); Charles R.\r\nLingley, _The Transition in Virginia from Colony to Commonwealth_\r\n(1910); Charles S. Sydnor, _Gentlemen Freeholders, Political Practices\r\nin Washington's Virginia_ (1952); Curtis P. Nettels, _George Washington\r\nand American Independence_ (1951).\r\n\r\nBiographies of prominent Virginians seem to come in pairs. There are two\r\nbiographies of William Claiborne, Norton C. Hale, _Virginia Venturer_\r\n(1951), and John H. Claiborne, _William Claiborne of Virginia_ (1917);\r\ntwo biographies devoted to the Lee family, Burton J. Hendrick, _The Lees\r\nof Virginia_ (1935), and Cazenove G. Lee, Jr., _Lee Chronicle_ (1956);\r\ntwo short studies of James Blair, Daniel E. Motley, _Life of Commissary\r\nJames Blair_ (1901), and Edgar L. Pennington, _Commissary Blair_ (1936);\r\ntwo biographies of Edmund Pendleton, Robert L. Hilldrup, _The Life and\r\nTimes of Edmund Pendleton_ (1939), and David J. Mays, _Edmund Pendleton_\r\n(1952); there are several biographies of Captain John Smith.\r\n\r\nPhilip A. Bruce, _The Virginia Plutarch_ (1929), gives brief biographies\r\nof Sir William Berkeley, Nathaniel Bacon, Alexander Spotswood, William\r\nByrd II, Patrick Henry, and others. Among other biographies are Richmond\r\nC. Beatty, _William Byrd of Westover_ (1932); Thomas J. Wertenbaker,\r\n_Torchbearer of the Revolution, The Story of Bacon's Rebellion and Its\r\nLeader_ (1940); Leonidas Dodson, _Alexander Spotswood_ (1932); Louis K.\r\nKoontz, _Robert Dinwiddie_ (1941); Louis Morton, _Robert Carter of\r\nNomini Hall_ (1941); Kate Mason Rowland, _Life and Correspondence of\r\nGeorge Mason_ (1892); William Wirt Henry, _Patrick Henry_ (1891); A. T.\r\nS. Goodrick, _Edward Randolph_ (1898-1909); Thomas Jefferson,\r\n_Autobiography_.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous Virginia local histories, among them W. Asbury\r\nChristian, _Richmond, Her Past and Present_ (1912); (1931); Ralph T.\r\nWhitelaw, _Virginia's Eastern Shore_ (1951); John B. Bodie, _Seventeenth\r\nCentury Isle of Wight County, Virginia_ (1938); Marshall Wingfield, _A\r\nHistory of Caroline County, Virginia_ (1924); and Herbert C. Bradshaw,\r\n_History of Prince Edward County, Virginia_ (1955).\r\n\r\n_The Virginia Gazette_ is a major source for the history of Virginia in\r\nthe eighteenth century. The scattered numbers still in existence have\r\nbeen photostated and copies deposited in some of the larger libraries.\r\nTheir usefulness has been greatly enhanced by the preparation of an\r\nIndex by Lester J. Cappon and Stella F. Duff.\r\n\r\nVirginia historians will always be grateful to Dr. Earl G. Swem for his\r\n_Virginia Historical Index_, covering _The Virginia Magazine of History\r\nand Biography_, volumes 1-38; _William and Mary College Quarterly_,\r\nfirst series, volumes 1-27; second series, volumes 1-10; Hening's\r\n_Statutes at Large_, and other publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n  Acadians: ejected, 204\r\n\r\n  Allerton, Isaac:\r\n    bribed with seat in Council, 20, 119;\r\n    refuses oath of allegiance, 126\r\n\r\n  Amherst, General Jeffrey: replaces Loudoun, 210\r\n\r\n  Andros, Sir Edmund:\r\n    Governor, 127;\r\n    despotic in New England, 127;\r\n    mild in Virginia, 129;\r\n    quarrels with Blair, 131;\r\n    suspends Blair from Council, 131;\r\n    resigns, 132\r\n\r\n  Appomatox Indians: hostile, 86\r\n\r\n  Argall, Samuel:\r\n    Governor, 6;\r\n    cruelty of, 7\r\n\r\n  Aristocracy:\r\n    effect of slavery on, 152, 153;\r\n    libraries, 153;\r\n    mansions, 153;\r\n    intermarriages, 153;\r\n    dominate General Court, 153, 154\r\n\r\n  Armistead, Col.
