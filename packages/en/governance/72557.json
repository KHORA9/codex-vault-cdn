ECONOMICAL PRINTING COMPANY,\r\n  NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of John Kelly, written without partisan bias, and to promote\r\nno other object but the vindication of the truth of history, is\r\npresented to the reader in the following pages.\r\n\r\nThe narrative is associated with three great epochs in American\r\nhistory, in each of which John Kelly has acted a prominent and\r\nconservative part. If he appears in the foreground of the picture which\r\nthe author has attempted to sketch of those epochs, it is because no\r\ntrue history of them can be written without according to him such a\r\nplace. He was the champion of civil and religious liberty during the\r\nera of Know-Nothingism, and contributed as powerfully to the overthrow\r\nof the Know-Nothing party as any man in the United States, with the\r\nsingle exception of Henry A. Wise, of Virginia, who slew the monster\r\noutright.\r\n\r\nIn the fierce war between Barnburner and Hunker, and Hard Shell and\r\nSoft Shell Democrats, which broke out in 1848, and continued to rage\r\nthroughout the State of New York with intense bitterness for eight\r\nyears, John Kelly, in 1856, played the conspicuous part of pacificator\r\nboth in the State and National Conventions of his party. The re-union\r\nwhich then took place between the Hards and Softs resulted in the\r\nnomination of Buchanan and Breckenridge at Cincinnati, who were\r\nelected President and Vice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe third epoch covers the contest with the Tweed Ring, and the\r\nexpulsion of the Ring from Tammany Hall in 1872, when the Reformers\r\nwere led by John Kelly. Grand Sachem Tweed had to give place to Grand\r\nSachem Augustus Schell; and Sachems Peter B. Sweeny, A. Oakey Hall, and\r\nRichard B. Connolly were succeeded by Sachems Horatio Seymour, Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden and John Kelly. It was not merely a change, but a revolution.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the results reached in 1872, and in the few years\r\nimmediately following, a leader of consummate power was necessary.\r\nHonesty, courage, and sagacity in the highest degree were required in\r\nthat leader. A man of action—not a visionary in the closet, was what\r\nthe times demanded. Upon John Kelly, who sought not the position, but\r\nhad it thrust upon him, then devolved the leadership of the Democratic\r\nparty in New York. The events of that period have passed into history,\r\nand although there were some who at the time called Kelly a dictator,\r\nposterity will be more apt to remember him as a benefactor.\r\n\r\nFor years the subject of this memoir has been the target of calumny and\r\nmisrepresentation. His whole life from childhood to the present hour is\r\nhere laid before the reader, as the best answer to his maligners.\r\n\r\n  J. F. McL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author has been at much pains to procure good pictures of Mr.\r\nKelly. The caricaturists have taken so many liberties with his face,\r\nand presented it in so many ridiculous lights, that public curiosity is\r\nfelt in every part of the United States to know exactly how John Kelly\r\ndoes look _in propria persona_. To gratify this curiosity the book has\r\nbeen embellished by three excellent likenesses of Mr. Kelly, taken at\r\nthe ages respectively of thirty-five, fifty, and fifty-eight. To Mr.\r\nEdward Bierstadt, whose picture of President Garfield has been much\r\nadmired, the reproduction in artotype of the pictures for this volume\r\nwas intrusted. Fine engravings were used to get the likeness, and the\r\nartotypist has executed his work with great success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n                                                                   PAGE.\r\n  Partisan Abuse.—Jackson also subjected to it.—The First\r\n  detailed Narrative of Life of John Kelly, Author’s long\r\n  Acquaintance with, Popular Misconception of his Character.—Anti-Kelly\r\n  Crusade in the Press.—Compared to\r\n  Nathaniel Macon.—Kelly a Safe Leader.                                3\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  Birthplace and Parentage.—A Good Mother.—Anecdote of\r\n  the Son.—Chastises a Larger Boy.—Narrow circumstances\r\n  of his Youth.—School Days.—Loses his Father.—Employed\r\n  by James Gordon Bennett in the _Herald_ Office.—At\r\n  Night School.—The Future Man as Sketched\r\n  in the Utica _Observer_.—Discusses Political Economy with\r\n  Bonamy Price of Oxford.—Relations of the Boy with Mr.\r\n  Bennett.—Their Friendship.—Leaves the _Herald_.—Apprenticed\r\n  to Jacob B.

Fifty or sixty years ago\r\nAndrew Jackson was subjected to similar treatment. The hero of New\r\nOrleans lived down the slanders which were hurled thick and fast upon\r\nhim by political opponents. Mr. Kelly will do the same thing, for the\r\npeople, though easily imposed upon for the moment by artful men, soon\r\ncorrect their own misconceptions, and invariably render justice to\r\npublic characters. The malice which invents slanders is incapable of\r\ntransmitting them into history.\r\n\r\nFugitive and imperfect sketches of John Kelly’s career have appeared\r\nfrom time to time in the newspapers. No detailed narrative of his life\r\nhas hitherto been submitted to the public. The writer of these pages\r\nis conscious of the difficulty of portraying the character of a living\r\nman. Appreciation of merit should not run into panegyric; condemnation\r\nof faults should not be spared where faults are found. The advantages\r\npossessed by the present writer to discharge the task he has undertaken\r\nhave been derived from an acquaintance with Mr. Kelly extending over\r\nthirty years, and from participation in public affairs in which that\r\ngentleman has been a conspicuous actor. Mr. Kelly has figured in\r\ntransactions which will form an interesting chapter in the history\r\nof the present times. The testimony of a contemporary who preserves\r\na distinct recollection of the events he describes will always be an\r\naid to the historian of the next age, who must sift evidence in order\r\nto get at the truth, and who should reject whatever falls below that\r\nstandard. There would not be so many fictions in American biography,\r\nif those who have participated in the scenes would record their honest\r\nrecollection of them. The testimony of an eye-witness is in the nature\r\nof primary evidence, and the historian can have no more helpful\r\nauxiliary than such a reminiscent. The following pages are offered to\r\nthe public as the contribution to American biography of one who has\r\nenjoyed unusual advantages of knowing the man he writes about.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly is one of the few remarkable men the present political\r\ngeneration has produced. The public has read so much about him both\r\nof pure fiction and coarse abuse, that an outline sketch of his life\r\nwill no doubt prove acceptable to candid readers, and furnish, at the\r\nsame time, a corrective of current misrepresentations. It might seem\r\nstrange to those who do not stop to consider the causes of it, that\r\na life-long citizen of New York, who has acted a prominent part in\r\nits affairs, should have come to be misunderstood by so many people.\r\nBut to those who look into the matter more closely the explanation is\r\nnot difficult to find. Mr. Kelly is a man of very positive character.\r\nHe has antagonized powerful men, and on several memorable occasions\r\nthwarted their schemes of ambition and self-aggrandizement. He has thus\r\nexcited resentments, and in their disappointment his opponents have\r\nsought revenge. Some of these gentlemen control great combinations of\r\ncorporate wealth, and possess enormous private fortunes. They have\r\nnot found it difficult to enlist a large section of the press into a\r\nspecies of anti-Kelly crusade. The weapons of partisan warfare are not\r\nvery choice, and this crusade has been carried on without much regard\r\nto the amenities of journalism, but with a resolute and persistent\r\nattention to the main idea, namely, the elimination of Mr. Kelly as a\r\npolitical leader, by proclaiming him to be the representative of one\r\nof the worst elements of American politics. But this mode of attack,\r\nwhile it may answer a temporary purpose, is always in the end a weak\r\none. Intelligent people become interested to know more of a man who\r\nexcites his opponents into storms of abuse, torrents of invective, and\r\nhurricanes, as it were, of rage. Is it all real, or does it cover a\r\npurpose? That becomes the question which the public soon ask, and its\r\nanswer is always favorable to truth, and fatal to the manipulators of\r\nan artificial excitement, for intelligent people have an independent\r\nway of getting at the truth the moment they suspect it is being kept\r\nback, and get at it they will, and they do.\r\n\r\nIn this manner John Kelly’s political opponents have really done him a\r\nservice. The universal gaze has been directed towards the man, and the\r\nmonster painted by reckless partisans of other and rival politicians\r\nhas been found to be no monster at all, but a plain, quiet man, honest\r\nand straightforward as old Nat. Macon himself—to whom he was once\r\nlikened by the late Alexander H. Stephens—of very original and rugged\r\norder of mind, of powers of command scarcely equalled by any other\r\nstatesmen in the United States to-day, a foe to humbug, a terror to\r\ncorruptionists—one, in short, to inspire love and respect rather than\r\nhatred and ill-will in the minds of disinterested people.\r\n\r\nThe writer thinks he knows John Kelly intimately and thoroughly.\r\nHis mind is powerful, without the acuteness of a Calhoun, or the\r\nimagination of a Webster, but as far as he sees his objects he sees\r\nwith the eye of a statesman, and no judgment was ever sounder. Of ideas\r\nin their simplicity men in general have but a partial cognition, an\r\napperception of consciousness, as philosophers term it, and not the\r\nclear perception. But the perceptive faculty is Mr. Kelly’s pre-eminent\r\nfeature. He is deliberate in mental operation, trusting nothing to\r\nfancy or imagination, and not distinguished for impulsive celerity of\r\naction, but almost invariably sure in his conclusions. Thus it has\r\nbeen sometimes, that his plans, when suddenly deranged in action by\r\nunforeseen circumstances, were not rapidly reformed, and defeat came\r\nupon him. But when he is in rest, and left to himself to devise and\r\nmap out movements, his judicious arrangement and skill in deciding\r\nupon what is best to do have proved almost faultless. Incapable of\r\nfear, he has seemed to some to go forward to his objects with blind\r\nobstinacy. But those who think so have a superficial knowledge of the\r\nman, for prudence is his controlling quality. Before he reaches a\r\ndecision, every circumstance and consideration is maturely weighed, all\r\nsuggestions are patiently heard, all doubts exert restraint upon him.\r\nIndeed, his prudence has exposed him to the charge by more hot-headed\r\nmen of being a plodder, so carefully does he labor to mature plans. It\r\nis only when he has reached a decision that his purpose becomes fixed\r\nand immovable, and he goes through with it, no matter what obstacles\r\nbeset his path, or what less courageous friends may advise to change\r\nhis resolution. Mr. Kelly has, in fine, granite firmness, and there is\r\na broad distinction between firmness and doggedness.\r\n\r\nNature has given him a high temper, but reflection and habits of\r\nself-command have reduced it to almost perfect subjection. If aroused,\r\nhowever, and goaded to passion, he is one of the most tremendous men\r\nin his wrath, and one of the most formidable in his mode of delivering\r\nbattle. A man of warm affections and commanding presence, his personal\r\nmagnetism is simply wonderful. His name, wherever he is well-known,\r\nis never mentioned at public meetings without storms of applause\r\nimmediately breaking forth. His appearance at public gatherings is\r\nalways the signal for hand clapping and expressions of welcome of that\r\nunmistakable sort only bestowed on a favorite. In this respect John\r\nKelly almost rivals Henry Clay, and since the death of the illustrious\r\nMill Boy of the Slashes no other man in America has had such an\r\nenthusiastic personal following.\r\n\r\nWhile his liberality is great it is unpretentious. Publicity in\r\nwell-doing is repulsive to his nature. His charity, which is almost\r\nceaseless, is consequently always silent. The solidest kind of man\r\nin build and character, he delights in action more than words, and\r\nis known in New York as the safe leader. His natural ascendency over\r\nmen is instinctively recognized. For these and kindred qualities his\r\ninfluence in American politics is as potent as that of any other\r\nstatesman in public life, and the reader of the following pages will\r\nfind, it is believed, that this influence has been always beneficially\r\nexerted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n HIS PARENTAGE AND EARLY LIFE—SCHOOL DAYS—EMPLOYED BY JAMES GORDON\r\n BENNETT—APPRENTICED TO JACOB B. CREAMER—DAVID C. BRODERICK—KELLY,\r\n CAPTAIN OF EMMET GUARDS—ATHLETIC SPORTS—HIS FONDNESS FOR PRIVATE\r\n THEATRICALS—RELIGIOUS STRIFE—A BATTLE AT THE POLLS—KELLY AS LEADER—THE\r\n KNOW-NOTHING PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly was born in the city of New York, April 20, 1822. The home\r\nof his parents and spot of his nativity was in Hester Street near Mott,\r\nin the old Sixth, afterwards changed into the Fourteenth Ward, famous\r\nfor its politicians. He springs from that stalwart race of men who have\r\nplayed so conspicuous a part in the history of the United States—Tyrone\r\nCounty Irishmen. From Tyrone County came Richard Montgomery, whom\r\nBancroft places second only to Washington as the military genius of the\r\nRevolutionary War; thence also came Alexander Porter, the illustrious\r\nLouisiana statesman, and one of the great lights of the United States\r\nSenate in its palmiest days. Archbishop Hughes, who left his impress\r\non the age in which he lived as one of its most remarkable men, and\r\nGeneral James Shields, one of the heroes of two American wars, who\r\nenjoyed the unprecedented distinction of having been elected to the\r\nUnited States Senate at various times by three great States of the\r\nUnion, were both emigrants from Tyrone County, Ireland. Out of this\r\nMilesian hive, seeking his fortunes in the New World in the early part\r\nof the present century, came Hugh Kelly, father of the subject of\r\nthis memoir. He married Sarah Donnelly, of County Fermanagh, a small\r\ncounty adjoining Tyrone. The marriage took place in Ireland. There were\r\nseven children born to the parents, of whom John was the fourth. The\r\nothers were five daughters and a son, the last named after the father,\r\nHugh. Old New Yorkers, who were acquainted with the mother of John\r\nKelly, have informed the writer of this memoir that she was a woman of\r\nremarkable force of character, a devout Christian, and a mother who\r\nbrought up her children in the love and fear of God. The children were\r\nall vivacious, and very communicative among themselves in the family\r\ncircle, with the exception of John, who was quiet and thoughtful,\r\nand a better listener than talker. On one occasion a neighbor paid a\r\nvisit to the Kellys, and brought news of an excursion, a pic-nic, or\r\nsome such affair, that pleased and greatly excited the little ones,\r\neach of whom, save John, had something to say about it. At length the\r\nneighbor looked over at John, who had remained a silent listener, and\r\nexclaimed, “Look at John there, with his big head, taking it all in,\r\nand not saying a word.” “Oh, yes,” said the mother, “that is his way;\r\nhe thinks a great deal more than he talks, but be sure he is not dumb.”\r\nA New York newspaper once cynically characterized him as an ox, but\r\nthe dumb ox, to use the figure of Albertus Magnus, has given a bellow\r\nwhich has been heard round the world. The devotion of Mrs. Kelly to\r\nher elder son was peculiarly tender. At one time, when he was a small\r\nboy, he had to cross the East River daily. The mother would often\r\naccompany him to the boat in the morning, and always went to meet him\r\non his return in the afternoon. Other boys going and returning at the\r\nsame time observed that young Kelly’s mother never failed to be at the\r\nlanding in the afternoon to accompany her son home. The mischievous\r\nboys sometimes cracked jokes at his expense, and teased him about his\r\nmother’s apron strings. He stood the bantering well enough for a time,\r\nbut at length grew tired of it. One of the tallest and strongest of the\r\nboys hearing that Kelly had threatened to thrash the next fellow that\r\nannoyed him on the subject, took it into his head to try his mettle.\r\n“Say, Kelly,” exclaimed this one, “how’s your mother? Boys, he’s got a\r\ngood mother, sure. She won’t let him go running about the streets with\r\nthe gang for fear he might learn something wicked, but comes for him\r\nand takes her little boy home every night. Come along, Johnny, and be\r\ntucked in your little bed. Bah!” A flushed face and clenched fist told\r\nthat Kelly would stand no more raillery of that sort. A smart battle\r\ntook place on the spot between the two youngsters, and ended in the\r\ndiscomfiture of the larger boy. Kelly’s victory made him a favorite\r\namong his companions, and they all soon came to look upon him as a\r\nsort of leader, although he would not loiter with the crowd at street\r\ncorners of evenings, nor haunt the purlieus of the city where youth\r\nloses its innocence, and flaunting vice slopes the way to ruin. Such a\r\nmother is a guardian angel to her children, and Mrs. Kelly’s afternoon\r\nescort to her son provoked no more jibes at the expense of the latter.\r\nThis incident affords an insight into the methods of his boyhood, and\r\nshows how, under the fostering hand of his mother, the character of\r\nthe future man was moulded. The American sin of cursing and swearing\r\nis first picked up by children running idly about the streets into all\r\nsorts of company. John Kelly was never addicted to this bad habit, and\r\nit may be doubted whether his most intimate friend of to-day ever heard\r\nhim utter a profane oath. The Psalmist’s aspiration to walk soberly and\r\nchastely in the day before the Divine Face should be the aim of the\r\nrising generation. With that object in view children should be kept out\r\nof temptation in the pitfalls of a great city. After awhile, when the\r\nhabits of a promising youth are formed on the right side, temptation\r\nassails him in vain, and whether it be from the cot of poverty or the\r\nmansion of wealth, a hero steps forth for life’s battle, who may be\r\ndepended upon to make his way, and render a good account of himself.\r\n\r\nIn the case of young Kelly, it was from the cot of poverty he emerged.\r\nHis father’s and mother’s business of a small retail grocery store\r\nafforded the family a modest but comfortable living. But while John\r\nwas still a small boy of eight years his father died, and the widow\r\nand her elder son had to become the bread-winners—the former managing\r\nthe store, and the latter, when about ten years old, going out in\r\nquest of employment. John had attended for some two or three years\r\nthe parochial school attached to old St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Mott\r\nStreet. Now he had to give up the school and go to work. It was a sore\r\ntrial to him, for he was ambitious of book learning, and the dream\r\nof his life was to get a good education. But he started out with a\r\nbrave resolution to seek employment. For a long time the search was\r\ntedious and unsuccessful. He had to take many surly replies from\r\nill-bred people, and often went home tired at night after a fruitless\r\nday’s rounds, to begin the work over again in the morning. But he\r\ntold his disappointments to no one, unless indeed to whisper them to\r\nthe fond mother whose strong heart went out in such sympathy with\r\nhis own, and whose sound practical sense helped him to form some new\r\nplan for the morrow. It is probable that the lesson he learned then\r\nof “man’s inhumanity to man” during his first humble trials to make\r\nhis way in life was never forgotten. When the day came for himself to\r\nmount to power, and to be called upon by many young and old seeking a\r\nfriendly hand to help them to their feet, John Kelly proved to be a\r\nreal philanthropist, uttering the gentle word, cheering the drooping\r\nheart by the overflowing generosity and charity of his own, and never\r\nallowing a human being to pass out of his doorway without feeling\r\nbetter and stronger for having carried his sorrow to him.\r\n\r\nOne day John went into the _Herald_ office, then in its infancy,\r\nand asked James Gordon Bennett whether he wanted an office boy. Mr.\r\nBennett scanned the boy over from head to foot without making a reply.\r\nSeemingly satisfied with the first scrutiny, he began a conversation\r\nwith him, which continued for five or ten minutes. There was no better\r\njudge of character than the elder Bennett, and he was always quick in\r\nmaking a decision. “Come in here, my lad, and take off your hat and get\r\nto work,” said he, and John Kelly found himself an employé forthwith of\r\nthe great editor. No two men have ever made their mark more thoroughly\r\nin the metropolis of the United States than James Gordon Bennett and\r\nJohn Kelly. Did the editor descry in that first glance at the boy the\r\nlatent powers which ultimately have made Kelly so distinguished? “It\r\nis said,” remarked the editor of the _Utica Observer_, in a notice of\r\nMr. John Kelly in that paper, “that old James Gordon Bennett took a\r\ngreat fancy to him. This speaks much in his praise, for the founder\r\nof the _Herald_ was quick to see the possibilities of greatness or\r\nusefulness in an undeveloped youth.”[1]\r\n\r\nEvening schools then but recently had been established in New York, and\r\nthe youth was quick to avail himself of the advantages they afforded to\r\nboys in his situation for acquiring an education. He became a regular\r\nattendant at one of those night schools, was a diligent and close\r\nstudent, and, like the great Sir Thomas More, “rather greedily devoured\r\nthan leisurely chewed his grammar rules.” The editor of the _Utica\r\nObserver_, one of Mr. Kelly’s most energetic opponents and Governor\r\nRobinson’s ablest advocate in the press, during the celebrated New\r\nYork gubernatorial struggle of 1879, declared of Kelly, in the heat of\r\nthat campaign, and in an article containing an attack upon him, “that\r\nthere is a great deal to admire in the character of John Kelly.” Of\r\nhis education the editor added: “His thirst for learning had not been\r\nsatisfied in his youth, and he proceeded by study to enlarge the scope\r\nof his understanding. He became a good scholar in French, as well as in\r\nEnglish, and for twenty years he has devoted several hours of every\r\nday to the pursuit of literature and science. If anybody has imbibed\r\nthe impression that Mr. Kelly is an ignorant man, he does not want\r\nto confront that delusion with an actual examination of Mr. Kelly’s\r\nacquirements. A Utica man who met him once in the presence of Prof.\r\nBonamy Price, of Oxford, says that he held his own in a discussion on\r\nPolitical Economy with England’s foremost teacher of that science.”[2]\r\nHe proved to be an excellent office-boy, was always at his post, and\r\nwas as punctual as the clock in fulfilling engagements. He became\r\na great favorite with Mr. Bennett, and when, at length, as he grew\r\nolder he resolved to give up his employment in the _Herald_ office in\r\norder to learn some regular business or trade, Mr. Bennett tried to\r\ndissuade him from his purpose, and offered additional compensation\r\nas an inducement for him to remain. But while greatly appreciating\r\nhis employer’s kindness, young Kelly replied that his mother and her\r\nlarge family mainly looked to him, the elder brother, for support,\r\nand that it had always been his intention to go into business on his\r\nown account. The time had now come to carry out that purpose. Mr.\r\nBennett, in his brusque but kindly Scotch voice, gave John some parting\r\nadvice and wished him well, predicting that success awaited him in his\r\nfuture career. The boy now apprenticed himself to Jacob B. Creamer,\r\na grate-setter and soap-stone cutter at 346 Broome Street, then on\r\nthe corner of Broome and Elizabeth, and speedily learned that trade.\r\nHe had grown to be a large boy, with the thews and sinews of a young\r\nHercules, and although he was not quarrelsome, he was high spirited\r\nand courageous, and would brook no insult from anyone. In the factory\r\nwhere he worked there was another young man, three or four years older\r\nthan himself, a dark complexioned powerful fellow, of a domineering\r\ntemper, with a reputation for fisticuffs. One day this person got\r\nangry with Kelly and struck him. Kelly returned the blow. The men in\r\nthe establishment separated them, but the blood of both was up, and a\r\nfight was agreed upon between them as soon as the bell should be rung\r\nfor dinner. They went into the factory yard and prepared for battle.\r\nThe hands about the establishment finding the boys meant to fight,\r\nundertook to secure fair play in the encounter. Kelly was much shorter\r\nthan his antagonist, and no one supposed he had any chance to win. At\r\nit they went pell mell, with a lively interchange of heavy thuds. The\r\nolder youth fought rapidly, and brought Kelly down several times with\r\nfurious blows. Fighting was not allowed while either of the boys was on\r\nthe ground, and in this way matters progressed for fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes, Kelly getting the worst of it all the time, but showing great\r\nendurance, and urging that no one should interfere. He had made thus\r\nfar but very little impression on his antagonist. He observed, however,\r\nthat one of his chance blows had caused the other to wince with pain.\r\nFrom that moment he took all the punishment the larger boy could\r\ninflict, and made the battle one of strategy, reserving himself to give\r\na blow in the same place, which he found to be the other’s weak spot.\r\nThe tide now began to turn, and it soon became evident to the onlookers\r\nthat the big swarthy fellow was no match either in courage or endurance\r\nfor Kelly. The latter, selecting the weak spot, laid his antagonist on\r\nhis back several times by well-directed blows. The last time he fell\r\nboth his strength and courage collapsed, and he bellowed out crying\r\nthat he was whipped and would fight no more. One of the men who had\r\nwitnessed the encounter with the closest attention from beginning to\r\nend, and saw that Kelly had won it by superior intelligence, now rushed\r\nup to him, and taking his hand exclaimed, “Well Johnny, my boy, you are\r\na born general sure, and you will yet be a great general over men when\r\nyou grow up to be a man yourself.” A few years ago an aged man entered\r\nMr. Kelly’s crowded office at 117 Nassau street, and sent in his name\r\nwith the rest. When his turn came he was admitted. “Do you not know me,\r\nMr. Kelly?” said the old man. “No,” was the reply, “I do not recall\r\nyou.” “Do you remember when you were a boy the fight you had with that\r\nbig swarthy fellow in Creamer’s factory yard, when one of the men told\r\nyou you would one day become a great general over men? Well, I was that\r\nvery man, and didn’t I tell the truth, sir?” Mr. Kelly remembered the\r\noccurrence and his visitor too, immediately, whom he had not seen for\r\nmany years, and laughed heartily over the reminiscence of his youth as\r\nhe shook the old man’s hand.\r\n\r\nHe worked industriously at his new occupation, and is said to have\r\ndisplayed mechanical skill of no mean order. In due time he set up in\r\nbusiness for himself, made friends rapidly, and secured an excellent\r\nline of custom. He became a prosperous young man, and was remarked upon\r\nfor sobriety, modesty of deportment and attention to business. It was\r\nnot long before he found himself able to branch out on a more extensive\r\nscale, for his friends were numerous and willing to lend him a helping\r\nhand when the needs of his business made it expedient to ask credit.\r\nWhile yet a very young man, his success was sufficiently assured to\r\njustify him in establishing a soap-stone and grate factory at 40\r\nElizabeth street, and he also opened an office where he took business\r\norders, in a frame building on Broome street, next door to the church\r\nover which Dr. Maclay at that time presided, and of which Dr. Cohen, in\r\nsubsequent years, became the pastor. Among his customers were Thomas\r\nO’Conor, father of Charles O’Conor, the lawyer; John A. Dix, afterward\r\nGovernor of New York; Horace F. Clark, and many other influential\r\npeople. John Kelly had now become a prosperous man. His first care was\r\nfor the beloved mother who had shaped the days of his youth in the\r\nways he should walk, but who departed this life in the most edifying\r\nsentiments of piety when he was quite a young man, scarcely twenty-one\r\nyears of age. His next care was for his younger brother and five\r\nsisters, towards whom he acted as a father, and for whose education\r\nand welfare he was now able to provide in a suitable manner. His own\r\nearly struggles for education had taught him to appreciate it highly\r\nin others, and he secured to his brother and sisters advantages which\r\ndisciplined their youthful years and qualified them for the duties of\r\nafter life. Later on he took his brother into partnership with him, but\r\nthat brother and all his sisters, save one, Mrs. Thomas, who lives near\r\nMexico, in Oswego County, New York, died many years ago. Mr. Kelly,\r\nas already mentioned, owed to his mother’s care the blessing of right\r\ntraining in his youth, and the consequent formation of his character\r\nin the practice of the Christian virtues. An old New Yorker who knew\r\nhis mother, has told the writer she was a thorough disciplinarian,\r\nand taught her children to love the truth in all things, and that the\r\nbeginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord. His mother died before\r\nher son’s brilliant success began; she who had equipped him for the\r\nbattle stayed not to enjoy its triumphs.\r\n\r\nAt this period of his life John Kelly had not a dream of ever entering\r\nupon a political career. In this respect he resembled another\r\ndistinguished New York statesman, the late Daniel S. Dickinson, who\r\nbegan life as a mechanic, became a woollen manufacturer, and, beyond\r\nbeing an earnest Democrat, passed several years with no inclination\r\nwhatever for the field of politics. It was true, however, that even\r\nfrom his boyhood John Kelly displayed rare capacity to lead others, and\r\nhe now found himself, in spite of preoccupation in the manufacturing\r\nbusiness, constantly called on by neighbors seeking his advice and\r\ninstinctively following him. He was once asked by a newspaper reporter\r\nif he ever sowed wild oats in his youth. “That may be called a leading\r\nquestion,” he replied; “I was in a gambling-house once in my life,\r\nbut it was on business—not to gamble. And I never was in a house of\r\nassignation in my life. I don’t know what the inside of such a house\r\nis.” “It is charged against you,” the reporter said, “that you attend\r\nchurch very regularly, and that you do it for effect.” “Well,” Mr.\r\nKelly said, “that’s a queer charge to make against any one. I had a\r\ngood careful mother who sent me to the Sunday-school regularly. I have\r\nbeen to church regularly ever since. Under such training, no doubt, I\r\nought to be a great deal better Christian than I am. I suppose I have\r\nbeen very wicked sometimes, and yet I can’t recall any time when I have\r\nbeen wilfully bad.”[3]\r\n\r\n“During Tweed’s ascendancy in New York politics,” said the well\r\ninformed Utica editor, in the article already quoted from, “Mr.\r\nKelly retired from Tammany Hall. Between him and Tweed the bitterest\r\nhostility always existed. It is pleasant to believe that Kelly’s\r\nsuperior virtue made him distasteful to the burly champion of\r\ncorruption. But that does not account for their feud. During the glow\r\nof his guilty glory, Tweed’s ambition was to secure the endorsement of\r\nmen of unimpeachable character. By turning back a page in political\r\nhistory, we might show how well he succeeded. But he could not make\r\nterms with John Kelly, for Mr. Kelly would accept no position but that\r\nof ruler. William M. Tweed swore a solemn oath that John Kelly never\r\nshould control Tammany Hall—and we all know what came of it.”\r\n\r\nShortly before his death, while he was a prisoner in Ludlow Street\r\nJail, Tweed was interviewed by a New York _Herald_ reporter, and gave\r\nwith undeserved freedom his impressions of the leading men he had known\r\nin politics. “Whom,” said the reporter, “do you regard as the most\r\nsuccessful city politician of New York in the thirty years of your\r\nexperience?” “John Kelly,” said Tweed. “He was always a plodder—always\r\nsaving something and learning something. He stood well with the\r\nChurch—rather a high class man in the Church—and got his support there.\r\nI never did but one thing for him; twenty years ago I helped him beat\r\nWalsh for Congress.” “When you came to politics,” asked the reporter,\r\n“did you ever remotely entertain the idea of such proportions as the\r\nRing afterwards assumed?” “No,” said Tweed. “The fact is, New York\r\npolitics were always dishonest—long before my time. There never was a\r\ntime when you couldn’t buy the Board of Aldermen, except now. If it\r\nwasn’t for John Kelly’s severity, you could buy them now.”[4]\r\n\r\nThe reporter of the _World_, with an odd sort of unconscious humor in\r\nhis interview, not unlike Tweed’s commercial valuation of piety as an\r\ninvestment, so naively suggested by the words, “rather a high class man\r\nin the Church,” bluntly told Mr. Kelly that it was not only complained\r\nagainst him that he attended Church, but that he aggravated the matter\r\nby attending it very regularly. No wonder Kelly should have thought\r\nthat a “queer charge” to make against him.\r\n\r\nAn old citizen of New York, acquainted with him from his youth, is\r\nauthority for the statement that Kelly was as fully a leader of the\r\nyoung men of his neighborhood when he first grew up, as he became of\r\nthe Tammany Democrats at a later day. He was of a social disposition,\r\nand while always temperate in his habits, he would go occasionally,\r\nafter getting through with his day’s work, to the Ivy Green, a famous\r\nhostelry in those days in Elm street, kept by Malachi Fallon, who went\r\nto California in 1849, and which was afterward kept by John Lord. The\r\nIvy Green, like Stonehall’s in Fulton Street, was a popular gathering\r\nplace for politicians and their friends. John Clancy, Peter B. Sweeny,\r\nMatthew Brennan, David C. Broderick, and many other active young\r\nfellows, who afterwards became prominent in politics, were in the habit\r\nof visiting the Ivy Green, and John Kelly would sometimes call there\r\nfor a chat with the boys. Less frequently, but once in a great while,\r\nKelly and Broderick, the latter being a warm friend of Kelly’s, also\r\ndropped in at the Comet, another place of resort of the same kind, kept\r\nby Manus Kelly on Mott street, where they would meet the same jolly\r\ncrowd that frequented the Ivy Green, and whither came quite often the\r\ncelebrated Tom Hyer, Yankee Sullivan, and other champions of the manly\r\nart of self-defence. “But,” said the writer’s informant, “none of these\r\nfighting men ever intermeddled with Kelly or Broderick. The best of\r\nthem would have had his hands full if he had done so.” Poor Broderick,\r\nwho afterwards became a United States Senator from California, finally\r\nfell in a duel in that State.\r\n\r\nYoung Kelly was very fond of athletic sports. He was a good oarsman,\r\nwas often on the water, and pulled a shell with the best. There was a\r\ncrack company called the Emmet Guards in New York, when Kelly was a\r\nyoung man. He was first lieutenant of this company during the captaincy\r\nof James McGrath, upon whose death he was elected captain, and being\r\nfond of military matters, he brought his company to a high state of\r\nefficiency. Captain Kelly retained the command until he was elected\r\nAlderman in 1853. The Old Volunteer Fire Department was then in its\r\nzenith. He was a member of it, and one of its leading spirits. While\r\nhe was in the Fire Department an incident occurred which has exercised\r\na restraining influence over him through life. At a fireman’s parade,\r\nwhile he was in line of March, a burly truckman attempted to drive\r\nthrough the ranks. Kelly was near the horses and kept them back. The\r\ndriver sprang to the ground, and made a furious attack on the young\r\nfire laddie. He received in return a blow from Kelly’s fist which ended\r\nthe battle by rendering the truckman insensible. He was borne to a\r\nneighboring doctor’s office, and was resuscitated with much difficulty.\r\nFor two or three days the truckman was disabled. Kelly, who had acted\r\nstrictly on the defensive, nevertheless was greatly distressed for his\r\nantagonist. He had been unaware of the almost phenomenal force of his\r\nown blow, and his tremendous hitting power was first fully revealed to\r\nhim by the effect of his fist on the truckman. To one of his intimate\r\nfriends he declared that he deeply regretted this affair, but that,\r\nperhaps, it had served a good purpose, for he was now unalterably\r\nresolved never again as long as he lived to strike any man with all his\r\nforce, no matter what the provocation might be.\r\n\r\nHis herculean strength and known courage have sometimes been seized\r\nupon by opponents for disparaging paragraphs in the newspapers, just\r\nas the combativeness of Andrew Jackson, in his earlier days, was\r\noften commented upon to his detriment. But as there was nothing mean\r\nor domineering in the temper of Jackson, any more than there is in\r\nKelly, only the high and unconquerable spirit that felt “the rapture of\r\nthe strife,” Old Hickory did not suffer in popular esteem on account\r\nof his early scrimmages. In 1828 Dr. James L. Armstrong, one of his\r\nold opponents in Tennessee, gathered up and published as a political\r\nnosegay a list of nearly one hundred pistol, sword and fist fights in\r\nwhich Jackson had been engaged between the ages of 23 and 60. Jackson\r\nreplied to this by promising to cudgel Armstrong on sight. The courage\r\nof some men is so conspicuous that they are recognized at once as\r\nheroes. In his admirable life of Nelson, Southey relates many acts of\r\napparently reckless intrepidity on the part of the hero of Trafalgar;\r\nbut, as it was with Jackson, so was it with Nelson, his conduct was\r\nnot the result of real recklessness; it was not the courage of the\r\nbull-dog, the maddened bull or the enraged lion, but rather the play\r\nof a spirit which rose with the occasion, the exhibition of a will not\r\nto be appalled by dangers common natures shrink from. It was such a\r\ncourage the poet had in view when he made Brutus say—\r\n\r\n    “Set honor in one eye, and death i’ the other,\r\n     And I will look on both indifferently.”\r\n\r\nOn several occasions in his career John Kelly has exhibited this\r\nheroic quality. Through his agency, at a stormy political convention\r\nin New York, when several of the most notorious partisans of Tweed,\r\nwhile clutching to retain the power which had been wrested from their\r\nfallen chief, were beaten at every point, a resort to brute force\r\nwas threatened, and several of the vilest desperadoes in the city\r\nwere despatched from the hall to waylay Kelly and take his life as he\r\npassed along the street. Some of his friends divined the purpose of\r\nthe would-be-assassins, and admonished Mr. Kelly of their movements. A\r\ncarriage was sent for, and he was urged to get into it and be driven\r\nhome, in order to avoid the bravos. Augustus Schell, Horace F. Clark,\r\nand several other friends tried to persuade him to enter the carriage.\r\nMr. Kelly replied that he generally went home by a certain route,\r\npointing to the street where the thugs were in hiding, and it was his\r\nintention to go that way then. If anybody wanted to kill him, the\r\nopportunity would be given, as he would neither seek nor avoid such\r\nmiscreants. “My friends,” he quietly remarked, “if you run away from\r\na dog, he will be very apt to bite you.” He went out of the hall and\r\napproached the corner, keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the sinister\r\ngroup gathered there like beasts of prey, passed on, and was not\r\nmolested. Determined to take his life, but deterred by cowardice when\r\nKelly confronted them, the villains made a plan to secrete themselves\r\nin a small unoccupied frame house on Lexington Avenue, between 33d\r\nand 34th streets, on the following morning, and to shoot him as he\r\nwent down town to business. An old man living in the neighborhood,\r\nby the merest accident overheard a part of the muttered plot of the\r\nconspirators, and saw them early next morning enter the deserted house.\r\nHe was a friend of Mr. Kelly, and suspected that he was to be attacked.\r\nHe went out, and meeting Mr. Kelly, told him of his suspicion, and\r\npointed out the house in which the men were concealed. John Kelly\r\ncrossed the street, and proceeded deliberately to enter the house and\r\nroom from which the Ring desperadoes in dumb astonishment watched his\r\napproach. Thinking they had been betrayed—for it must have flashed upon\r\nthem that Kelly would not have the madness to do such a thing unless\r\nhe had assistance at hand—the terrified assassins fled from the rear of\r\nthe house as he entered at the front. He went into the room they had\r\njust quit, and saw four men running through a vacant lot as fast as\r\ntheir legs could carry them into the next street. Alone and absolutely\r\nunassisted, save by the cool judgment and unflinching courage which\r\neminently distinguish his character, he adopted this hazardous line of\r\nconduct as the most effective way of confounding a gang of murderous\r\nruffians, and stamping out their cowardly plots. He succeeded. The Ring\r\nmen beset his path no more.\r\n\r\nThose acquainted with John Kelly are aware that there is a humorous\r\nside to his character, and that he possesses mimic powers of a high\r\norder. It is not generally known, but it is a fact however, that\r\nwhen he first grew up to manhood he was one of the organizers of an\r\nAmateur Dramatic Association, which had its headquarters in a hall\r\nat the corner of Elm and Canal Streets, and which sent forth several\r\nprofessional actors who afterwards attained eminence on the stage.\r\nCharles Place, Samuel Truesdale, Mr. Godwin, John Kelly and other well\r\nknown citizens of New York were members of this company; and several\r\ngreat tragedies, notably some of the now neglected ones of Shakespeare,\r\nwere essayed by these aspiring youths. “Many of Mr. Kelly’s friends,”\r\nsaid a writer in September, 1880, in a New York weekly paper called\r\n_The Hour_, “will be surprised to learn that he once, in the character\r\nof Macbeth, sturdily challenged Macduff to ‘lay on’; that as the\r\nsable-clad Hamlet he was accustomed to win applause as he expressed\r\nthe wish that his ‘too, too solid flesh would melt’; and that his\r\npassionate outbursts as the jealous Moor in ‘Othello’, were wont to\r\nbring down the house. Equally astonished will they be to hear that, in\r\nthe versatility of his genius, he was as much a favorite in ‘Toodles’\r\nand other of Burton’s eccentric comedy parts as in the higher walk of\r\ntragedy.”\r\n\r\nIn Kelly’s younger days religious persecution and hostility to\r\nforeigners had begun to be shown in not a few localities. This\r\nintolerant spirit, which had lain dormant in America from the days of\r\nWashington to the end of Monroe’s administration, broke forth with\r\ngreat fury in several parts of the country after the close of the\r\n“era of good feeling.” The fathers of the Republic were liberal men\r\nwho kept this spirit at a distance. Archbishop Carroll of Baltimore,\r\nthe friend of Washington, was chosen by a unanimous resolution of\r\nCongress, and in compliance with the desire of the clergy and laity\r\nof all denominations, to deliver the first anniversary address upon\r\nthe father of his country after his death. The address was delivered\r\nFebruary 22, 1800, and is still preserved. Bishop Cheverus of Boston,\r\nafterwards Cardinal Archbishop of Bordeaux, France, was the warm\r\npersonal friend of John Adams, and when the Bishop was about to build\r\na church in Boston, the first name on the list of his subscribers was\r\nthat of President Adams. When Bishop Dubois, the friend of Lafayette,\r\nwas driven into exile by the French Revolution, he found a place of\r\nrefuge in Virginia, a home in the private residence of James Monroe,\r\nafterwards President, friends in his host and Patrick Henry, and,\r\nhaving no church of his own, a chapel in the capitol at Richmond\r\nwhich the legislature of Virginia placed at his disposal to be used\r\nfor the offices of religion. These halcyon days of Christian charity\r\nand toleration in America were now about to be rudely interrupted. In\r\n1831, the same Dubois, then Bishop of New York, had the mortification\r\nto see his church of St. Mary’s, in that city, set on fire by an\r\nincendiary and burned down. The first Catholic college in the State\r\nof New York was built in the neighborhood of Nyack, on the Hudson, in\r\n1833, by this prelate. Religious bigotry incited by Rev. Dr. Brownlee\r\nand other enemies of the Catholics, soon applied the torch to the\r\nstructure and reduced it to ashes. In 1834 the Ursuline Convent at\r\nCharlestown, Massachusetts, was burned and sacked. Two or three years\r\nlater an anti-Catholic mob formed the design of burning St. Patrick’s\r\nCathedral in New York. A pious churchman, Bishop Dubois was also a\r\nman of courage. If the civil authorities would not stay the fury of\r\nthe mob, he determined to protect himself, and defend his church\r\nfrom destruction. John Kelly, then a well grown youth and a favorite\r\nof Bishop Dubois, was selected by him on account of his prudence\r\nand extraordinary courage as a sort of _aid de-camp_ to Lawrence\r\nLangdon, the leader of a large body of citizens who assembled in the\r\nvicinity of the Cathedral for defense. The streets were torn up for a\r\nconsiderable distance; paving stones, wagons and omnibuses were used\r\nfor barricades; armed men filled the Cathedral, and the walls of the\r\nadjoining grave-yard glistened with swords and bayonets. The Bishop\r\nenjoined the utmost forbearance upon his people, and gave them positive\r\norders not to begin the assault, and to avoid collision with the mob\r\nuntil the Cathedral might be attacked. Conspicuous in carrying out the\r\norders of the leader, and in directing the movements of the defending\r\nparty, and maintaining constant communication between Langdon and\r\nhis followers, was young John Kelly of the Fourteenth Ward. The mob\r\napproached through Broadway, a dense body extending for several blocks,\r\nmarching in solid line and filling the street from one side to the\r\nother. They turned into Prince Street and approached the Cathedral.\r\nKelly carried the order at this moment for the defenders to lie down\r\nin the grave-yard and keep perfectly quiet. It was night, and the mob\r\nmarched on until stopped by the barricades, when they found the whole\r\nneighborhood in a state of siege. The ample preparations to receive\r\nthem disconcerted the church-burners, and the silence of the defending\r\nparty, of whose presence they had become aware, made the incendiaries\r\nwary and apprehensive. They faltered and lost heart, and slunk away\r\nin the direction of the Bowery, terrified from their wicked design by\r\nthe intrepid courage of one old Bishop. They passed along the sidewalk\r\nadjoining the burial-ground in lines six deep, with frightful oaths\r\nupon their lips, while the men in the city of the dead remained as\r\nstill and motionless as the tenants of the tombs below, but every\r\nfinger was on a trigger, and every heart beat high with resolve to\r\ndefend St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the graves of their fathers from\r\nsacrilege and desecration. Driven by cowardly fear from the church, the\r\nmob crossed to the Bowery, wrecking the houses of several Irishmen,\r\nand the tavern called the Green Dragon, on the way, and finally their\r\nfury was let loose on the private residence of Mr. Arthur Tappan, the\r\nfamous abolitionist, whose windows and doors they broke, and otherwise\r\ninjured his property. Thus by the prudence of the Cathedral defenders\r\nin avoiding collision with the mob, a terrible sacrifice of life\r\nwas escaped, and young John Kelly, inspired by the counsel of the\r\nBishop and his own coolness and sagacity, played a prominent part in\r\npreventing bloodshed and saving the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against foreigners, an outgrowth of that aversion which\r\nthe old Federal party leaders manifested towards Frenchmen, Germans\r\nand Irishmen, indeed to all foreigners except Englishmen, continued to\r\nincrease in bitterness after the close of the “era of good feeling.” A\r\npolitical party was at last organized on a platform of disfranchisement\r\nof the Irish and “the Dutch,” the latter being a commonly used misnomer\r\nfor the Germans. This party took the name of Native Americans. It\r\nadvocated laws prohibiting Irish and German emigrants from landing on\r\nthese shores, and practical denial of the right of suffrage, or of\r\nholding office, to those already here. For some years this unwise and\r\nunstatesmanlike policy of exclusion and proscription seriously checked\r\nthe tide of emigration from Europe. Had the Native Americans prevailed,\r\ninstead of the fifty odd millions of population in the United States\r\nto-day, there would have been less than twenty millions, and the wealth\r\nand greatness of the country would be diminished in like proportion.\r\nInstead of being, perhaps, the greatest nation in the world, the United\r\nStates would occupy the position of a fourth or fifth-rate power,\r\na little but not much ahead of Canada on the north, and the South\r\nAmerican governments on the south.\r\n\r\nAs the greater number of the foreign population were Roman Catholics,\r\na sectarian element was infused into the new party, and with bigotry\r\nsuperadded to a widespread jealousy of foreigners, the Native American\r\nparty soon signalized itself by burning down Catholic churches and\r\ncolleges, and by bloody chance-medleys and deliberate riots with German\r\nand Irish adopted citizens. In the year 1844 these disturbances reached\r\na climax. A terrible riot occurred that year in Philadelphia, in which\r\nmany lives were sacrificed, and the Catholic church of St. Augustine\r\nwas laid in ashes by the mob. The scenes in that city bore resemblance\r\nto some of the godless excesses in Paris during the reign of terror. To\r\nbe a foreigner was to brave death, to be a Catholic to court martyrdom\r\nin free America.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture the Native American party in the city of New\r\nYork again threatened the destruction of St. Patrick’s Cathedral.\r\nThe New York _Courier and Enquirer_, and _Evening Express_ fanned\r\nthe passions of the people to white heat by appeals to sectarian and\r\nrace prejudices. But there was a man then at the head of the Catholic\r\nChurch in New York who possessed many of the qualities for which\r\nAndrew Jackson was distinguished. Bishop Hughes belonged to the tribe\r\nof the lions. He perceived that it was the favorite policy of the\r\nNative Americans to make New York city an anti-foreign stronghold.\r\nThere, Catholics and adopted citizens were powerful; crushed there,\r\nit would be an easy matter to prostrate them everywhere. In the month\r\nof May, 1844, the Native American leaders in New York, invited their\r\nbrethren of Philadelphia, who had most distinguished themselves in the\r\ndeplorable events in that city, to visit New York, and to bring with\r\nthem emblems of the horrible scenes in Kensington at the time of the\r\nburning of the church of St. Augustine, the better to fire the New York\r\nheart. A delegation of Philadelphians promised to accept the invitation\r\nand carry on the emblems. A public reception, and a procession through\r\nthe streets, were to take place. It became evident that the purpose of\r\nthis sinister movement was to re-enact in New York the scenes which\r\nhad just disgraced Philadelphia. Bishop Hughes took decisive action.\r\nHe admonished Catholics to keep away from public meetings and unusual\r\ngatherings of the populace, and, to avoid in a special manner, all\r\ndisturbers of the peace. That great man, in looking over the city for\r\nprudent and conservative persons to aid him in carrying out his policy\r\nof forbearance, found no one on whom he more implicitly relied, and\r\nwho proved more effective in the emergency than John Kelly. Bishop\r\nHughes and John Kelly’s father were natives of the same county and\r\nneighborhood in Ireland. Between the Bishop and his fellow countryman’s\r\nson a warm friendship existed. They were both endowed with minds of\r\nsingular originality and power, both natural leaders of men, both\r\npossessed a remarkable hold on the respect and affections of the\r\npeople. Among the Whigs, at this perilous juncture, Bishop Hughes\r\nalso found several powerful supporters, chief among whom were William\r\nH. Seward, Horace Greeley and Thurlow Weed. As the time drew near for\r\nthe Native American demonstration, popular excitement and fears of a\r\nterrible riot increased. Bishop Hughes now called on the Mayor of the\r\ncity, Robert H. Morris, and advised him not to allow the demonstration\r\nto take place. “Are you afraid that some of your churches may be\r\nburned?” the Mayor asked. “No, sir, but I am afraid that some of yours\r\nwill be burned,” the Bishop said; “we can protect our own. I came to\r\nwarn you for your own good.” “Do you think, Bishop, that your people\r\nwould attack the procession?” “I do not; but the Native Americans want\r\nto provoke a Catholic riot, and if they can do it in no other way, I\r\nbelieve they would not scruple to attack the procession themselves, for\r\nthe sake of making it appear that the Catholics had assailed them.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, would you have me do?” asked the Mayor. “I did not come to\r\ntell you what to do,” the Bishop said. “I am a Churchman, not the Mayor\r\nof New York; but if I were the Mayor, I would examine the laws of the\r\nState and see if there were not attached to the police force a battery\r\nof artillery, and a company or so of infantry, and a squadron of horse;\r\nand I think I should find that there were; and if so, I should call\r\nthem out. Moreover, I should send to Mr. Harper, the Mayor-elect, who\r\nhas been chosen by the votes of this party. I should remind him that\r\nthese men are his supporters; I should warn him that if they carry out\r\ntheir designs there will be a riot; and I should urge him to use his\r\ninfluence in preventing the public reception of the delegates.”[5]\r\n\r\nThis characteristic stand of Bishop Hughes had its effect. No public\r\nreception of the church burners took place, but for nearly two weeks\r\nthe Cathedral was guarded every night, and the mob which threatened its\r\ndestruction was kept at bay. During those dark days Bishop Hughes found\r\nJohn Kelly to be one of the most prudent young men in the Cathedral\r\nparish, energetic in danger, conservative in conduct, and always\r\nresponsive to the call of duty. His manly bearing then may be said to\r\nhave laid the foundation of that enduring confidence in his judgment,\r\nand respect for his character, which the Bishop ever afterwards felt\r\nand expressed. Mr. Kelly was not a zealot, and there is not a tinge\r\nof bigotry in his nature. He was then, as he is now, a true liberal,\r\nand has always declared that religion and politics should be kept as\r\nwide apart as the poles. But he is the foe of intolerance, and while\r\ndespising the arts of the demagogue, no man in New York has done more\r\nto uphold foreign citizens in their rights, and to emancipate the\r\nballot-box from persecution on the one hand, and fraudulent voting on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe Native American party finally developed into the notorious\r\nKnow-Nothing movement, the party of grips, and signs, and\r\ndark-lanterns. In many of the election districts of New York no\r\nforeigner dared approach the polls. The primaries were even worse,\r\nand were conducted in defiant disregard of the election laws. In John\r\nKelly’s ward, which was a fair illustration of every other ward in the\r\ncity, any Irishman or German risked his life by going to the polls.\r\nGangs of repeaters and thugs, as far as they could, kept all foreigners\r\nfrom the primaries. These tools of the Know-Nothing leaders would fill\r\nthe room where the election was held, take possession of the line,\r\ncrowd out their opponents by threats or violence, return again and\r\nagain, force their way, after passing the spot where the votes were\r\nreceived, once more into the line, and repeat the farcical act of\r\nvoting a second and third time, keeping up the villany until relieved\r\nby another squad of repeaters, who continued to enact the same scenes\r\nuntil the close of the polls. A friendly police force connived at these\r\nrascalities, and openly backed up the repeaters and ballot-box stuffers\r\nwhenever a determined citizen, in the exercise of his rights, resisted\r\nexpulsion from the line, or attempted to defend himself from assault.\r\nSo great became the terror these law-breakers inspired, that opposition\r\nto them was practically at an end. This state of affairs was more\r\nhumiliating, since the majority of voters in the Fourteenth Ward were\r\nknown to be Democrats. John Kelly protested against these outrages as a\r\nprivate citizen, and at a meeting of Democrats declared his intention\r\nof attending the next primary election in the Fourteenth Ward, then\r\nnear at hand, and exercising his right of voting at all hazards. Those\r\nwho knew the man knew this was not an idle boast, but many tried to\r\ndissuade him from the rash attempt, which, if persisted in, would\r\nlikely enough cost him his life.\r\n\r\nThe primary election was to take place in a hall, long since removed,\r\nin the march of the city, which then stood on the corner of Grand and\r\nElizabeth Streets. The part of the room for the inspectors’ seats was\r\nprotected by a high partition, and a box desk, like a bank teller’s\r\nwindow, with a hole only large enough for a voter’s hand to be put\r\nthrough in handing his ballot, to the receiving inspector, was placed\r\nat one side of the partition. A narrow path in the main room, fenced in\r\nby high rails, to allow but one voter to approach at a time, afforded\r\nthe only means of access to the polls. When the voter handed in his\r\nballot, that was the last he saw of it, as the partition effectually\r\nshut off observation from without. As a matter of fact it was the\r\npractice of the inspector to throw the vote into a waste basket, on\r\nthe floor at his feet, if it was not of the approved sort. This mode\r\nof taking the _vox populi_ had long been in practice, and was not\r\nonly an open evasion of the statute, which provided for the presence\r\nof watchers for the several parties, whose legal right it was to see\r\nthat all had a fair opportunity to vote, but it was adopted with\r\nthe deliberate purpose of protecting the swindling inspectors from\r\ndetection while engaged in the nefarious work of making way with legal\r\nballots. On the day of the election John Kelly was early on the scene,\r\nand was accompanied by a large number of the lawful voters of the ward,\r\nwho appointed him as their watcher at the polls. He and his friends\r\nforced their way into the hall, and as the black hole, behind which\r\nthe frauds were practiced, was there in violation of the statute, it\r\nwas straightway demolished, in order to secure at least a semblance of\r\nfairness to the voting about to take place. The Know-Nothings were at\r\nfirst struck dumb with astonishment at this bold step on the part of\r\nthe Democrats. To defend themselves from violence was as much as the\r\nlatter had previously attempted. Rage soon took the place of surprise,\r\nand a furious attack was made on those who had removed the box screen\r\nfrom about the inspectors’ desk. John Kelly, who had been recognized\r\nas a Democratic watcher, was also set upon by the gang of ballot-box\r\nstuffers. A fierce scuffle ensued. But the Democrats outnumbered the\r\nKnow-Nothings, and drove them from the hall. The leaders of the latter\r\nparty, uttering vows of vengeance, declared they would soon return\r\nwith reinforcements, and make short work of Kelly and his party. They\r\nrepaired to the ship-carpenters’ quarters at the foot of Delaney\r\nstreet, and soon the news of their discomfiture was spread abroad among\r\nthe thousands of mechanics in that part of the city. These mechanics\r\nwere, for the most part, engaged in ship building, for those were\r\nthe days when New York’s famous clipper ships whitened the seas and\r\nbrought back cargoes of commerce from all parts of the world. The\r\nship carpenters constituted a formidable body of athletic men, whose\r\ninfluence at elections was cast on the side of the Know-Nothings. It\r\nwas not long before a body of these mechanics, over a thousand in\r\nnumber, was drummed up in Delaney street and vicinity, and marshalled\r\nby notorious Know-Nothing bullies, the crowd started for the hall in\r\nGrand street to inflict condign punishment upon John Kelly and the\r\nFourteenth Ward Democrats, who had shown the unprecedented audacity of\r\ninterfering with the usual Know-Nothing methods of carrying elections\r\nin that ward. In the meantime the Democrats had not been idle, but had\r\nrecruited their own ranks to prepare for the threatened attack. Soon\r\nthe two parties came into collision, and a desperate encounter took\r\nplace. But for a second time the victory remained with the Democrats.\r\nThe Know-Nothings, unaccustomed to serious opposition, were not\r\nprepared for it now, and advanced in a promiscuous manner, expecting\r\nto bear down opposition and to have everything their own way. The\r\nDemocrats presented a compact front, and fought in companies of ten\r\neach. The hall was cleared a second time of the assailing party. A\r\ngreat multitude was now gathered in the streets threatening to tear\r\ndown or burn the building, when the Democrats suddenly sallied forth\r\nwith the precision of veterans, and struck the Know-Nothing mob at a\r\ndozen different points simultaneously. The mob being gathered from\r\nall parts of the city greatly exceeded the Democrats in numbers, but\r\nthe sub-divisions of tens on the part of the latter worked so well\r\nthat their onslaught became irresistible. Soon the mob were flying\r\nin all directions, some seeking refuge in stores, others in private\r\nhouses, and the rest were pursued into and through the Bowery with\r\ngreat impetuosity. “The hour was come and the man.” None knew it better\r\nthan the Know-Nothing Dirk Hatteraicks of New York. The effect of that\r\nday’s work in the Fourteenth Ward was felt all over the city of New\r\nYork for years afterwards, and its immediate consequence was to break\r\nthe backbone of Know-Nothingism in the ward in which it occurred.\r\nThereafter Democrats, whether native or foreign born, were not afraid\r\nto appear at election places. The moral effect was salutary. The timid\r\nwere reassured, the indifferent were roused into interest in public\r\naffairs, and fair elections became more frequent in New York city.\r\nThe one strong man who had worked this revolution was John Kelly. The\r\nIrish and German population looked upon him as their deliverer, and\r\nfrom that day forth the Know-Nothing power on the East side of the city\r\ndwindled into insignificance, and no further attempts to stifle the\r\nvoice of the majority took place. Kelly became identified in the minds\r\nof the adopted citizens of all nationalities, but especially of the\r\nIrish, who were chiefly aimed at, as their champion. Henceforth it was\r\nnot possible for this strong man, this born leader of his fellows, to\r\nfollow the bent of his inclinations and remain in a private station.\r\nHe was elected to the Board of Aldermen, and next to the Congress of\r\nthe United States. The Know-Nothings, by their excesses in New York,\r\nhad raised up an adversary to their oath-bound secret organization who\r\nwas destined to accomplish as much in the Empire State for equal rights\r\nto all citizens, native and foreign-born, as Alexander H. Stephens, in\r\na similar contest, wrought out in Georgia, and Henry A. Wise, by his\r\ngreat anti-Know-Nothing campaign accomplished in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Utica Observer_, Sept. 16, 1879.\r\n\r\n[2] _Utica Observer_, Sept. 16, 1879.\r\n\r\n[3] New York _World_, Oct. 18, 1875.\r\n\r\n[4] New York _Herald_ October 26, 1877.\r\n\r\n[5] Clarke’s Lives of the Deceased Bishops, vol. ii., pp. 111-112.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n THE GREAT COMMONER OF GEORGIA—SPEECH OF A.

STEPHENS, AND JAMES GORDON BENNETT—THE ERA OF\r\n KNOW-NOTHINGISM—KELLY’S PART IN ITS OVERTHROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future historian of the United States, when he comes to\r\ntreat of that extraordinary movement in American politics called\r\nKnow-Nothingism, will not do justice to the subject unless he\r\nassigns the post of honor in the work of its overthrow as a national\r\norganization to Stephens of Georgia, Wise of Virginia, and Kelly of New\r\nYork. A glance at the great work accomplished by these three men is all\r\nthat can be attempted in this memoir.\r\n\r\n“True Americanism,” said Alexander H. Stephens in his memorable\r\nAnti-Know-Nothing contest in Georgia in 1855, “as I have learned it, is\r\nlike true Christianity—disciples in neither are confined to any nation,\r\nclime or soil whatever. Americanism is not the product of the soil;\r\nit springs not from the land or the ground; it is not of the earth,\r\nor earthy; it emanates from the head and the heart; it looks upward,\r\nand onward and outward; its life and soul are those grand ideas of\r\ngovernment which characterize our institutions, and distinguish us from\r\nall other people; and there are no two features in our system which so\r\nsignally distinguish us from all other nations as _free toleration_ of\r\nreligion and the doctrine of _expatriation_—the right of a man to throw\r\noff his allegiance to any and every other State, prince or potentate\r\nwhatsoever, and by _naturalization_ to be incorporated as a citizen\r\ninto our body politic. Both these principles are specially provided\r\nfor and firmly established in our Constitution. But these American\r\nideas which were proclaimed in 1789 by our ‘sires of ’76’ are by\r\ntheir ‘sons’ at this day derided and scoffed at. We are now told that\r\n‘naturalization’ is a ‘humbug,’ and that it is an impossibility. So did\r\nnot our fathers think. This ‘humbug’ and ‘impossibility’ they planted\r\nin the Constitution; and a vindication of the same principle was one of\r\nthe causes of our second war of independence. Let no man, then, barely\r\nbecause he was born in America, presume to be imbued with real and true\r\n‘Americanism,’ who either ignores the direct and positive obligations\r\nof the Constitution, or ignores this, one of its most striking\r\ncharacteristics. An Irishman, a Frenchman, a German, or Russian, can be\r\nas thoroughly American as if he had been born within the walls of the\r\nold Independence Hall itself. Which was the ‘true American,’ Arnold or\r\nHamilton? The one was a native, the other an adopted son.”[6]\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens had declined to be a candidate for Congress in 1855,\r\nand the Know-Nothings taunted him with cowardice, because, they\r\nsaid, if he should run he knew he was doomed to defeat. His letter\r\non Know-Nothingism to Judge Thomas, from which the preceding extract\r\nis quoted, was denounced furiously by the Know-Nothings, who\r\nloudly predicted that the letter would prove to be his political\r\nwinding-sheet. These taunts were published throughout the country, and\r\ninduced Mr. Stephens to change his mind, and re-enter the field as\r\na candidate for the Thirty-fourth Congress. In a speech at Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, in which he announced this purpose, he said: “I have heard\r\nthat it has been said that I declined being a candidate, because a\r\nmajority of the district were Know-Nothings, and I was afraid of being\r\nbeaten. Now, to all men who entertain any such opinion of me, I wish to\r\nsay that I was influenced by no such motive. I am afraid of nothing on\r\nearth, or above the earth, or under the earth, except to do wrong—the\r\npath of duty I shall ever endeavor to travel, ‘fearing no evil,’ and\r\ndreading no consequences. Let time-servers, and those whose whole\r\nobject is to see and find out which way the popular current for the\r\nday and hour runs, that they may float upon it, fear or dread defeat\r\nif they please. I would rather be defeated in a good cause than to\r\ntriumph in a bad one. I would not give a fig for a man who would shrink\r\nfrom the discharge of duty for fear of defeat. All is not gold that\r\nglitters, and there is no telling the pure from the base until it is\r\nsubmitted to the fiery ordeal of the crucible and the furnace. The best\r\ntest of a man’s integrity and the soundness of his principles is the\r\nfurnace of popular opinion, and the hotter the furnace the better the\r\ntest. I have traveled from a distant part of the State, where I first\r\nheard these floating taunts of fear—as coming from this district—for\r\nthe sole and express purpose of announcing to you, one and all, and\r\nin this most public way to announce to the other counties, without\r\ndistinction of party, that I am again a candidate for Congress in this\r\ndistrict. The announcement I now make. My name is hereby presented to\r\nthe district; not by any convention under a majority or a two-third\r\nrule—but by myself.\r\n\r\n“I know, fellow-citizens, that many of you differ with me upon those\r\nexciting questions which are now dividing—and most unhappily, too, as\r\nI conceive—dividing our people. It is easy to join the shouts of the\r\nmultitude, but it is hard to say to a multitude that they are wrong.\r\nI would be willing to go into one of your Know-Nothing lodges or\r\ncouncils, where every man would be against me, if I could be admitted\r\nwithout first having to put myself under obligations never to tell\r\nwhat occurred therein, and there speak the same sentiments that I shall\r\nutter here this night. Bear with me, then, while I proceed.[7] It is to\r\nexhibit and hold up even to yourselves the great evils and dangers to\r\nbe apprehended from this ‘new,’ and, I think, most vicious political\r\n‘monster,’ that I would address you; and against the influences of\r\nwhich I would warn and guard you, as well as the rest of our people.\r\nWhile the specious outside title of the party is that ‘Americans shall\r\nrule America,’ when we come to look at its secret objects as they leak\r\nout, we find that one of its main purposes is, not that ‘Americans\r\nshall rule America,’ but that those of a particular religious faith,\r\nthough as good Americans as any others, shall be ruled by the rest.\r\n\r\n“But it is said the ‘proscription’ is not against a religious but a\r\npolitical enemy, and the Roman Church is a political party, dangerous\r\nand powerful. Was a bolder assertion, without one fact to rest upon,\r\never attempted to be palmed off upon a confiding people? The Roman\r\nChurch a political party! Where are its candidates? How many do they\r\nnumber in our State Legislatures or in Congress? What dangers are\r\nthey threatening, or what have they ever plotted? Let them be named.\r\nWas it when Lord Baltimore, a Catholic, established the colony of\r\nMaryland, and for the first time on this continent established the\r\nprinciple of free toleration in religious worship? Was it when Charles\r\nCarroll, a Catholic, signed the Declaration of Independence? But it\r\nis said that great danger is to be apprehended from the Catholics\r\nbecause of a ‘secret order’ amongst them, known as Jesuits. ‘No one,’\r\nsays a Know-Nothing writer, ‘knows, or possibly can know, the extent\r\nof their influence in this country. One of them may eat at your\r\ntable, instruct your children, and profess to be a good Protestant,\r\nand you never suspect him. Their great aim is to make their mark in\r\nAmerica. Perjury to them is no sin, if the object of it be to spread\r\nCatholicism or acquire political influence in the country.’ Whether\r\nthis be true of the Jesuits or not I cannot say. But I submit it to\r\nthe consideration of candid minds how far it is true of the new order\r\nof Know-Nothings, which is now so strenuously endeavoring to make its\r\nmark in America, and to gain political influence in the country, not\r\nonly by putting down all foreigners, and all native-born citizens who\r\nmay be of Catholic faith, but also all other native-born citizens who\r\nwill not take upon their necks the yoke of their power. Do not hundreds\r\nand thousands of them go about daily and hourly, denying that they\r\nbelong to the order, or that they know anything about it? May they\r\nnot, and do they not ‘eat at your table,’ attend your sick, and some\r\nof them preach from your pulpits, and yet deny that they know anything\r\nabout that ‘order’ which they are making such efforts to spread in the\r\nland? I do not say all of them do this; but is it not common with the\r\n‘order,’ thus by some sort of equivocation and slippery construction,\r\nto mislead and deceive those with whom they converse? There is\r\nnothing worse that can be said of any man or any people indicating a\r\ndestruction of morals or personal degradation, than that ‘the truth\r\nis not in him.’ It is the life and soul of all the virtues, human or\r\ndivine. Tell me not that any party will effect reformation of any\r\nsort, bad as we now are in this land, which brings into disrepute this\r\nprinciple upon which rests all our hopes on earth, and all our hopes\r\nfor immortality. And my opinion is that the Protestant ministers of\r\nthe Gospel in this country, instead of joining in this New England,\r\npuritanical, proscriptive crusade against Catholics, could not render a\r\nbetter service to their churches, as well as the State, in the present\r\ncondition of morals amongst us, than to appoint a day for everyone of\r\nthem to preach to their respective congregations from this text, ‘What\r\nis truth?’ Let it also be a day set aside for fasting, humiliation and\r\nprayer—for repentance in sackcloth and ashes—on account of the alarming\r\nprevalence of the enormous sin of lying! Was there ever such a state of\r\ngeneral distrust between man and man before? Could it ever have been\r\nsaid of a Georgia gentleman, until within a few months past, that he\r\nsays so and so, but I don’t know whether to believe him or not? Is it\r\nnot bringing Protestantism, and Christianity itself, into disgrace when\r\nsuch remarks are daily made, and not without just cause, about Church\r\ncommunicants of all our Protestant denominations—and by one church\r\nmember even about his fellow-member? Where is this state of things to\r\nlead to, or end, but in general deception, hypocrisy, knavery, and\r\nuniversal treachery?\r\n\r\n“Was ever such tyranny heard of in any old party in this country as\r\nthat which this new ‘order’ sets up? Every one of them knows, and\r\nwhether they deny it or not, there is a secret monitor within that\r\ntells them that they have pledged themselves never to vote for any\r\nRoman Catholic to any office of profit or trust. They have thus pledged\r\nthemselves to set up a religious test in qualifications for office\r\nagainst the express words of the Constitution of the United States.\r\nTheir very organization is not only anti-American, anti-republican,\r\nbut at war with the fundamental law of the Union, and, therefore,\r\nrevolutionary in its character, thus silently and secretly to effect\r\nfor all practical purposes a change in our form of government. And what\r\nis this but revolution? Not an open and manly rebellion, but a secret\r\nand covert attempt to undermine the very corner-stone of the temple of\r\nour liberties.\r\n\r\n“Whenever any government denies to any class of its citizens an equal\r\nparticipation in the privileges, immunities, and honors enjoyed by all\r\nothers, it parts with all just claim to their allegiance. Allegiance\r\nis due only so long as protection is extended; and protection\r\nnecessarily implies an equality of right to stand or fall, according\r\nto merit, amongst all the members of society, or the citizens of\r\nthe commonwealth. The best of men, after all, have enough of the\r\nold leaven of human nature left about them to fight when they feel\r\naggrieved, outraged and trampled upon; and strange to say, where men\r\nget to fighting about religion they fight harder, and longer and more\r\nexterminatingly than upon any other subject. The history of the world\r\nteaches this. Already we see the spirit abroad which is to enkindle\r\nthe fires and set the fagots a blazing—not by the Catholics, they are\r\ncomparatively few and weak; their only safety is in the shield of\r\nthe constitutional guarantee; minorities seldom assail majorities;\r\nand persecutions always begin with the larger numbers against the\r\nsmaller. But this spirit is evinced by one of the numerous replies to\r\nmy letter. The writer says: ‘We call upon the children of the Puritans\r\nof the North, and the Huguenots of the South, by the remembrance of\r\nthe fires of Smithfield, and the bloody St. Bartholomew, to lay down\r\nfor once all sectional difficulties,’ etc., and to join in this great\r\nAmerican movement of proscribing Catholics. What is this but the\r\ntocsin of intestine strife? Why call up the remembrance of the fires\r\nof Smithfield but to whet the Protestant appetite for vengeance? Why\r\nstir up the quiet ashes of bloody St. Bartholomew, but for the hope,\r\nperhaps, of finding therein a slumbering spark from which new fires\r\nmay be started? Why exhume the atrocities, cruelties, and barbarities\r\nof ages gone by from the repose in which they have been buried for\r\nhundreds of years, unless it be to reproduce the seed, and spread\r\namongst us the same moral infection and loathsome contagion?—just as it\r\nis said the plague is sometimes occasioned in London by disentombing\r\nand exposing to the atmosphere the latent virus of the fell disease\r\nstill lingering in the dusty bones of those who died of it centuries\r\nago. Fellow citizens, Fellow Protestants, Fellow Americans—all who\r\nreverence the constitution of your country—I entreat you, and I envoke\r\nyou to give no listening ear to such fanatical appeals.\r\n\r\n“When the principles of the Constitution are disregarded, when those\r\n‘checks and restraints,’ put in it as Mr. Madison has told us, for\r\n‘a defence to the people against their own temporary errors and\r\ndelusions,’ are broken down and swept away, when the whole country\r\nshall have been brought under the influence of the third degree of this\r\nKnow-Nothing order, if that time shall ever come, then, indeed may the\r\ndays of this Republic, too, be considered as numbered.\r\n\r\n“I wish to say something to you about this third degree, the union\r\ndegree, as it is called. For under this specious title, name or guise,\r\nthe arch-tempter again approaches us, quite as subtly as under the\r\nother of ‘Americans shall rule America.’ The obligation taken in\r\nthis degree is ‘to uphold, maintain and defend’ the Union, without\r\none word being said about the Constitution. Now, as much as we all,\r\nI trust, are devoted to the Union, who would have it without the\r\nConstitution? This is the life and soul of it—this is its animating\r\nspirit. It is this that gives it vitality, health, vigor, strength,\r\ngrowth, development and power. Without it the Union could never have\r\nbeen formed, and without it it cannot be maintained or held together.\r\nWhere the animating principle of any living organism is extinguished,\r\nthis is death, and dissolution is inevitable. You might just as well\r\nexpect that the component parts of your bodies could be held together\r\nby some senseless incantations after the vital spark has departed, as\r\nthat this Union can be held together by any Know-Nothing oaths when\r\nthe Constitution is gone. Congress is to be done away with, except in\r\nso far as its members may be necessary, as the dumb instruments for\r\nregistering the edicts of an invisible but all-powerful oligarchy. Our\r\npresent Government is to be paralyzed by this boa-constrictor, which is\r\nnow entwining its coils around it. It is to be supplanted and displaced\r\nby another self-constituted and secretly organized body to rise up in\r\nits stead, a political ‘monster,’ more terrible to contemplate than the\r\nseven-headed beast spoken of in the Apocalypse.\r\n\r\n“I have seen it stated in the newspapers by some unknown writer, that\r\nmy letter to Col. Thomas will be my political winding-sheet. If you\r\nand the other voters of the Eighth Congressional District so will it,\r\nso let it be; there is but one other I should prefer—and that is the\r\nConstitution of my country; let me be first wrapped in this, and then\r\ncovered over with that letter, and the principles I have announced this\r\nnight; and thus shrouded I shall be content to be laid away, when the\r\ntime comes, in my last resting-place without asking any other epitaph\r\nbut the simple inscription carved upon the headstone that marks the\r\nspot—‘Here sleep the remains of one who dared to tell the people they\r\nwere wrong when he believed so, and who never intentionally deceived a\r\nfriend, or betrayed even an enemy.’”[8]\r\n\r\nThus spoke Alexander H. Stephens, Georgia’s greatest statesman, of\r\nthe pernicious tendencies of the Know-Nothing party. On that speech\r\nhe ran for Congress and was elected by three thousand majority.\r\nKnow-Nothingism was thus slain in Georgia. Since the death of Mr.\r\nStephens some scribbler with a talent for forgery has taken the\r\nquotation marks from the paragraph about the Jesuits in the foregoing\r\nspeech, affixed Mr. Stephens’s name to it, and sent it on its rounds\r\nthrough the press as the declared opinion of the dead statesman\r\nconcerning the followers of Loyola. Mr. Stephens quoted the paragraph\r\nfrom a Know-Nothing writer, not to approve the attack on the Jesuits,\r\nbut for the opposite purpose of showing it applied to the Know-Nothings\r\nthemselves. No man in this country could use the weapon of retort\r\nwith more effect than Alexander H. Stephens, and his remarks on the\r\nparagraph in question afford a favorable instance of his power in that\r\nline. That this stupid calumny on the great man who battled so nobly\r\nfor the equal rights of Catholics and Protestants, Jews and Gentiles,\r\nforeign born and native Americans, should have been palmed off on the\r\npublic, is less surprising than that it should have found its way into\r\ncertain Catholic newspapers, in the columns of at least one of which\r\nthe present writer read it shortly after the death of Mr. Stephens.\r\n\r\nThe ever memorable conflict in Virginia of 1855, between the\r\nKnow-Nothings and Democrats, was led on the part of the latter by\r\nthe gallant Henry A. Wise. That conflict was one of great national\r\nmagnitude. If the Know-Nothings, theretofore victorious, had then\r\nsucceeded, it is likely a civil war precipitated by religious\r\nfanaticism would have followed, not to be conducted between the States,\r\nas later unfortunately occurred, but between citizens of the same\r\ncities, and towns and neighborhoods throughout the Union, with a fury\r\nto make humanity shudder—in every sense of the word a civil war. The\r\nVirginia election of that year was, therefore, watched with intense\r\ninterest by the whole American people, and a feeling of feverish\r\nexcitement was everywhere visible. Henry A. Wise, the uncompromising\r\nenemy of the Know-Nothings, was named as the Democratic candidate\r\nfor Governor of Virginia. Never was such a canvass before. He went\r\neverywhere, pouring out fiery eloquence in the Western Mountains, in\r\nthe Blue Ridge that milks the clouds, upon the Potomac, lovely River of\r\nSwans, on the Rappahannock, the Piankatank, Mob Jack Bay, James River,\r\nElizabeth River, down to the North Carolina line; and wherever he went\r\nthis second Patrick Henry stirred the people’s hearts as they had not\r\nbeen stirred before. One of the best stump speeches ever heard in this\r\ncountry was made by Mr. Wise at Alexandria. He had declared hostility\r\nto the Know-Nothings in a letter to a citizen of Virginia, written\r\nSeptember 18, 1854.\r\n\r\nIn that letter he said: “I am a native Virginian; my ancestors on\r\nboth sides for two hundred years were citizens of this country and\r\nthis State—half English, half Scotch. I am a Protestant by birth, by\r\nbaptism, by intellectual belief, and by education and by adoption. I\r\nam an American, in every fibre and in every feeling an American; yet\r\nin every character, in every relation, in every sense, with all my\r\nhead and all my heart, and all my might, I protest against this secret\r\norganization of native Americans and of Protestants to proscribe Roman\r\nCatholic and naturalized citizens. As early as 1787 we established a\r\ngreat land ordinance, the most perfect system of eminent domain, of\r\nproprietary titles, and of territorial settlements, which the world\r\nhad ever beheld to bless the homeless children of men. It had the very\r\nhouse-warming of hospitality in it. It wielded the logwood axe, and\r\ncleared a continent of forests. It made an exodus in the old world, and\r\ndotted the new with log-cabins, around the hearths of which the tears\r\nof the aged and the oppressed were wiped away, and cherub children were\r\nborn to liberty, and sang its songs, and have grown up in its strength\r\nand might and majesty. It brought together foreigners of every country\r\nand clime—immigrants from Europe of every language and religion, and\r\nits most wonderful effect has been to assimilate all races. Irish\r\nand German, English and French, Scotch and Spaniard, have met on the\r\nWestern prairies, in the Western woods, and have peopled villages and\r\ntowns and cities—queen cities, rivalling the marts of Eastern commerce;\r\nand the Teutonic and Celtic and Anglo-Saxon races have in a day mingled\r\ninto one undistinguishable mass—and that one is American. The children\r\nof all are crossed in blood in the first generation, so that ethnology\r\ncan’t tell of what parentage they are—they all become brother and\r\nsister Jonathans. As in the colonies, as in the revolution, as in the\r\nlast war, so have foreigners and immigrants of every religion and\r\ntongue contributed to build up the temple of American law and liberty\r\nuntil its spire reaches to heaven, whilst its shadow rests on earth. If\r\nthere has been a turnpike road to be beaten out of the rocky metal, or\r\na canal to be dug, foreigners and immigrants have been armed with the\r\nmattock and the spade and if a battle on sea and land had to be fought,\r\nforeigners and immigrants have been armed with the musket and the blade.\r\n\r\n“We can name the very hour of our birth as a people. We need recur to\r\nno fable of a wolf to whelp us into existence. As a nation we are but\r\nseventy-eight years of age. Many persons are now living who were alive\r\nbefore this nation was born. And the ancestors of this people about\r\ntwo centuries only ago were foreigners, every one of them coming to\r\nthe shores of this country to take it away from the aborigines, and to\r\ntake possession of it by authority either directly or derivatively of\r\nPapal Power. His Holiness the Pope was the great grantor of all the\r\nnew countries of North America. Foreigners in the name of the Pope and\r\nMother Church took possession of North America, to have and to hold the\r\nsame to their heirs against the heathen forever. And now already their\r\ndescendants are for excluding foreigners, and the Pope’s followers\r\nfrom an equal enjoyment of this same possession. So strange is human\r\nhistory. Christopher Columbus! Ferdinand and Isabella! What would they\r\nhave thought of this had they foreseen it when they touched a continent\r\nand called it theirs in the name of the Holy Trinity, by authority\r\nof the keeper of the keys of Heaven, and of the great grantor of the\r\nempire and domain of earth? What would have become of our national\r\ntitles to northeastern and northwestern boundaries, but for the plea of\r\nthis authority, valid of old among all Christian powers?”\r\n\r\nWriting thus in September, 1854, Mr. Wise, although he had been a Whig\r\nyears before, was nominated for Governor by the Democrats in December\r\nof the same year. In his famous Alexandria speech, before discussing\r\nKnow-Nothingism, he told the people some practical truths explanatory\r\nof the decadence of the prosperity of Virginia, of the causes producing\r\nit, and the remedies to be applied. “You have,” he said, “the bowels of\r\nyour Western mountains rich in iron, in copper, in coal, in salt, in\r\ngypsum, and the very earth is so rich in oil that it sets the rivers in\r\nflame. You have the line of the Alleghany, that beautiful Blue Ridge\r\nwhich stands placed there by the Almighty, not to obstruct the way of\r\nthe people to market, but placed there in the very bounty of Providence\r\nto milk the clouds, to make the sweet springs which are the sources\r\nof your rivers. And at the head of every stream is the waterfall\r\nmurmuring the very music of your power to put spindles in motion. And\r\nyet commerce has long ago spread her sails and sailed away from you;\r\nyou have not as yet dug more than coal enough to warm yourselves at\r\nyour own hearths; you have set no tilt-hammer of Vulcan to strike blows\r\nworthy of gods in the iron foundries. You have not yet spun more than\r\ncoarse cotton enough, in the way of manufacture, to clothe your own\r\nslaves. You have had no commerce, no mining, no manufactures. You have\r\nrelied alone on the single power of agriculture; and such agriculture!\r\nYour sedge patches outshine the sun. Your inattention to your only\r\nsource of wealth has scarred the very bosom of mother earth. Instead\r\nof having to feed cattle on a thousand hills, you have had to chase\r\nthe stump-tailed steer through the sedge patches to procure a tough\r\nbeef-steak. You are in the habit of discussing Federal politics; and\r\npermit me to say to you, very honestly and very openly, that next to\r\nbrandy, next to card playing, next to horse-racing, the thing that has\r\ndone more harm to Virginia than any other in the course of her past\r\nhistory, has been her insatiable appetite for Federal politics. She has\r\ngiven all her great men to the Union. Her Washington, her Jefferson,\r\nher Madison, her Marshall, her galaxy of great men she has given to the\r\nUnion. Richmond, instead of attending to Richmond’s business, has been\r\ntoo much in the habit of attending to the affairs of Washington city,\r\nwhen there are plenty there, God knows, to attend to them themselves.\r\n* * “Puritanism,” said Mr. Wise, has disappeared, and we have in place\r\nof it Unitarianism, Universalism, Fourierism, Millerism, Mormonism—all\r\nthe odds and ends of isms—until at last you have a grand fusion of all\r\nthose odds and ends of isms in the _omnium gatherum_ of isms called\r\nKnow-Nothingism. Having swept the North, the question was: How can this\r\nism be wedged in in the South? And the devil was at the elbow of these\r\npreachers of ‘Christian politics’ to tell them precisely how.” [At this\r\npoint Mr. Wise was interrupted by cat-calls, derisive cheers and other\r\nmanifestations of the Know-Nothing element of the meeting.] “There were\r\nthree elements in the South,” continued the speaker, “and in Virginia\r\nparticularly, to which they might apply themselves. There is the\r\nreligious element, the 103,000 Presbyterians, the 300,000 Baptists, the\r\n300,000 Methodists of Virginia. Well, how were they to reach them? Why,\r\njust by raising a hell of a fuss about the Pope!\r\n\r\n“Cæsar’s kingdom is political, is a carnal kingdom. And I tell you\r\nthat if I stood alone in the State of Virginia, and if priestcraft—if\r\nthe priests of my own Mother Church dared to lay their hands on the\r\npolitical power of our people, or to use their churches to wield\r\npolitical influence, I would stand, in feeble imitation it may be, but\r\nI would stand, even if I stood alone, as Patrick Henry stood in the\r\nRevolution, between the parsons and the people. These men, many of\r\nwhom are neither Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists,\r\nCongregationalists, Lutherans, nor what not—who are men of no religion,\r\nwho have no church, who do not say their prayers, who do not read their\r\nBible, who live God-defying lives every day of their existence, are\r\nnow seen with faces as long as their dark-lanterns, with the whites\r\nof their eyes turned up in holy fear lest the Bible should be shut\r\nup by the Pope! You tell the people that Catholics never gave aid to\r\ncivil liberty; that they never yet struck a blow for the freedom of\r\nmankind. Who gave you alliance against the crown of England? Who but\r\nthat Catholic king, Louis XVI. He sent you from the Court of Versailles\r\nLafayette, the boy of Washington’s camp, a foreigner who never was\r\nnaturalized, but who bled at the redoubt of Yorktown, when Arnold, a\r\nnative, like Absalom proved traitor.\r\n\r\n“And, Sir, before George Washington was born, before Lafayette wielded\r\nthe sword, or Charles Carroll the pen for his country, six hundred and\r\nforty years ago, on the 16th of June, 1214, there was another scene\r\nenacted on the face of the globe, when the general charter of all\r\ncharters of freedom was gained, when one man, a man called Stephen\r\nLangton, swore the Barons of England for the people against the power\r\nof the King—swore the Barons on the high altar of the Catholic Church\r\nat St. Edmundsbury, that they would have Magna Charta or die for it.\r\nThe charter which secures to every one of you to-day trial by jury,\r\nfreedom of the press, freedom of the pen, the confronting of witnesses\r\nwith the accused, and the opening of secret dungeons—that charter was\r\nobtained by Stephen Langton against the King of England, and if you\r\nKnow-Nothings don’t know who Stephen Langton was, you know nothing sure\r\nenough. He was a Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. I come here not to\r\npraise the Catholics, but I come here to acknowledge historical truths,\r\nand to ask of Protestants—what has heretofore been the pride and boast\r\nof Protestants—tolerance of opinion in religious faith.\r\n\r\n“All that I have to say to the Democracy is that you want active,\r\nearnest organization. Remember that if these Know-Nothings hold\r\ntogether they are sworn compact committees of vigilance. Go to work\r\nthen. Organize actively everywhere. Appoint your vigilance committees,\r\nbut take especial care that no Know-Nothings are secretly and unknown\r\nto you upon them. Be prepared. I have gone through most of Eastern\r\nVirginia, and in spite of their vaunting I defy them to defeat me.\r\nThere are Indians in the bushes, but I’ll whack on the bayonet, and\r\nlunge at every shrub in the State till I drive them out. I tell them\r\ndistinctly there shall be no compromise, no parley. I will come to no\r\nterms. They shall either crush me, or I will crush them in this State.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wise, though his health was impaired, conducted his campaign with\r\nextraordinary energy, travelling about 3000 miles, to every point\r\nin the State, and speaking fifty times before the election. He was\r\ntriumphantly elected Governor of Virginia, receiving upwards of ten\r\nthousand majority over his Know-Nothing competitor. The impartial\r\nverdict of history is that Henry A. Wise did more to kill the\r\nKnow-Nothing party than any other man in the United States.\r\n\r\nMany Know-Nothings were elected to Congress from the Northern States,\r\nand a few from the Southern States. In the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives there were seventy-eight members of that party in 1855.\r\nConspicuous among them all, on account of his prejudices no less than\r\nhis ability, was Henry Winter Davis, a member of the Thirty-fourth and\r\nThirty-fifth Congresses from Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated controversy upon the floor of Congress between Davis\r\nand John Kelly on the Know-Nothing question entitles the Know-Nothing\r\nleader to some notice here.\r\n\r\nHenry Winter Davis was born at Annapolis, Maryland, August 16, 1817,\r\nand received his education at Kenyon College, Ohio, where he was\r\ngraduated in 1837. His father was an Episcopalian minister. Young\r\nDavis was sent to the University of Virginia in 1839 by his aunt, a\r\nMiss Winter of Alexandria, Virginia, and entered upon his preparatory\r\nlegal studies at that institution. He afterwards opened a law office\r\nat Alexandria, where he struggled with poverty for some years, making\r\nbut little mark in that community, save as an occasional contributor\r\nof political essays to the Alexandria _Gazette_, but applying himself\r\nclosely to his studies, and becoming an able lawyer. Reverdy Johnson\r\nrecognized his talents and advised him to remove to Baltimore, where\r\nhe would find a wider field for their display. Mr. Davis acted on this\r\nadvice, and made Baltimore his home. He had married a Miss Cazenove\r\nof Alexandria, who soon died, and subsequently he married a daughter\r\nof John S. Morris, a wealthy and prominent citizen of Baltimore. Mr.\r\nMorris opposed the marriage on account of Davis’s peculiar political\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nHenry Winter Davis was a man of genius, with a natural bent for an\r\nopposition leader. In person he was handsome, in manners haughty and\r\nreserved, in demeanor elegant; and he possessed the gift of a fine\r\noratory, both logical and persuasive. A morose temper and a cynical\r\nand cold nature served to heighten the picturesque effect of his\r\ncharacter, and to make him delight in fomenting discord and violence.\r\n“The ignorant Dutch and infuriated Irish, let them beware lest they\r\npress the bosses of the buckler too far,” is said to have been a form\r\nof expression he applied to Germans and Irishmen in the course of\r\none of his invectives on the stump in Baltimore. He soon became an\r\nacknowledged leader of the Know-Nothings, and no man knew better how\r\nto fire the rage and incite to acts of bloodshed the Plug Uglies of\r\nthat city. Had Davis lived during the era of the Alien and Sedition\r\nLaws, his genius probably would have placed him at the head of that\r\nconspiracy, and his name would have become famous in history. He was a\r\ncontemner of the sanctions of authority. The sacredness of institutions\r\nhanded down from generation to generation unimpaired by the ravages of\r\ntime, awakened no sense of reverence in the mind of this iconoclast.\r\nBurke’s beautiful allusion to the bulwarks of civil society which have\r\nbeen stamped with the “mysterious virtue of wax and parchment,” must\r\nhave appeared to him only as a figure of rhetoric or a ridiculous\r\nfetich. How contemptuously he regarded the warning of Washington to his\r\ncountrymen in the Farewell Address against entangling alliances with\r\nthe nations of Europe is discovered in the following passage, found at\r\npage 367, of a book written by Mr. Davis, called “The War of Ormuzd and\r\nAhriman in the Nineteenth Century.”\r\n\r\n“They who stand with their backs to the future and their faces to the\r\npast, wise only after the event, and refusing to believe in dangers\r\nthey have not felt, clamorously invoke the name of Washington in their\r\nprotest against interference in the concerns of Europe. With such it\r\nis useless to argue till they learn the meaning of the language they\r\nrepeat.”\r\n\r\nWith many similar sophistries he declared it would be wise policy on\r\nthe part of the United States to take part in European controversies,\r\nand pretended to find warrant in the Monroe doctrine for this radical\r\nreversal of Washington’s maxim. But that Davis was a demagogue in\r\nthe offensive sense of the word is evident from the fact that the\r\nvery advice of General Washington against foreign influence, which he\r\nscouted at in his book, was soon after relied upon by the same Davis as\r\nhis chief argument in Congress for the exclusion of foreigners from the\r\nrights and privileges of citizenship. In the course of a Know-Nothing\r\nspeech, delivered in the House of Representatives, January 6th, 1857,\r\nhe said: “Foreign allies have decided the government of the country.\r\n* * * * Awake the national spirit to the danger and degradation of\r\nhaving the balance of power held by foreigners. Recall the warnings of\r\nWashington against foreign influence, here in our midst, wielding part\r\nof our sovereignty; and with these sound words of wisdom let us recall\r\nthe people from paths of strife and error to guard their peace and\r\npower.” The insincerity of Davis is further shown from his conduct in\r\nregard to the Republican party. He denounced that party in the speech\r\nabove quoted from, saying, among other things, “the Republican party\r\nhas nothing to do and can do nothing. It has no future. Why cumbers\r\nit the ground?” In the course of a few years he became a Republican,\r\nand notwithstanding his former denunciation of them, swallowing at a\r\nsingle breath the most ultra tenets of that party. Consistent only in\r\nhis inconsistencies, he again prepared to bolt from the Republican\r\norganization shortly before his death, and was the author of the\r\ncelebrated Wade-Davis Manifesto in 1864, against the renomination of\r\nAbraham Lincoln. Once having been invited by a literary society of\r\nthe University of Virginia to deliver the annual address before that\r\nbody, he took up some eccentric line of political conduct before the\r\ncommencement day occurred, and compelled the society in self-respect\r\nto revoke its invitation. He affected the Byronic manner, and the\r\ncontagion spread to other members of Congress. Roscoe Conkling, after\r\nhe entered the House of Representatives, is said to have become a\r\ngreat admirer of Henry Winter Davis, and to have fallen into his\r\npeculiarities of style as a public speaker. Mr. Conkling’s famous\r\nparliamentary quarrel with Mr. Blaine soon after occurred.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man the Know-Nothings recognized as their leader in the\r\nHouse of Representatives when John Kelly entered that body. In the\r\nearly part of 1857 Mr. Kelly replied to a sneering assault of Mr.\r\nDavis on the Irish Brigade, and in the debate which followed not only\r\nproved himself able to cope with the Know-Nothing leader, but in a\r\nrunning debate with Mr. Kennett of Missouri, Mr. Akers of the same\r\nState, and Mr. Campbell of Ohio, who entered the lists against him,\r\nKelly established his reputation as one of the best off-hand debaters\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from the speeches on the occasion, which are taken\r\nfrom the _Congressional Globe_, will furnish an idea of the style of\r\nthe speakers, and the merits of the controversy. In referring to the\r\nPresidential election of 1856, and the victory of the Democrats, Mr.\r\nDavis said: “The Irish Brigade stood firm and saved the Democrats from\r\nannihilation, and the foreign recruits in Pennsylvania turned the fate\r\nof the day. They have elected, by these foreigners, by a minority\r\nof the American people, a President to represent their divisions.\r\nThe first levee of President Buchanan will be a curious scene. He is\r\na quiet, simple, fair-spoken gentleman, versed in the by-paths and\r\nindirect crooked ways whereby he met this crown, and he will soon know\r\nhow uneasy it sits upon his head. Some future Walpole may detail the\r\ncurious greetings, the unexpected meetings, the cross purposes and\r\nshocked prejudices of the gentlemen who cross that threshold. Some\r\nhonest Democrat from the South will thank God for the Union preserved.\r\nA gentleman of the disunionist school will congratulate the President\r\non the defeat of Mr. Fillmore. The Northern gentlemen will whisper\r\n‘Buchanan, Breckenridge and Free Kansas’ in the presidential ear,\r\nand beg without scandal the confirmation of their hopes. * * But how\r\nto divide the spoils among this motley crew—ah! there’s the rub.\r\nSir, I envy not the nice and delicate scales which must distribute\r\nthe patronage amid the jarring elements of that conglomerate, as\r\nfierce against each other as clubs in cards are against spades. * *\r\nThe clamors of the foreign legion will add to the interest of the\r\nscene. They may not be disregarded, for but for them Pennsylvania was\r\nlost, and with it the day. Yet what will satisfy these indispensable\r\nallies, now conscious of their power? That, Sir, is the exact\r\ncondition of things which will be found in the ante-chamber—exorbitant\r\ndemands, limited means, irreconcilable divisions, strife, disunion,\r\ndissolution—whenever the President shall have taken the solemn oath of\r\noffice and darkened the doors of the White House.\r\n\r\n“The recent election has developed in an aggravated form every evil\r\nagainst which the American party protested. Foreign allies have decided\r\nthe government of the country—men naturalized in thousands on the eve\r\nof the election. Again in the fierce struggle for supremacy, men have\r\nforgotten the ban which the Republic puts on the intrusion of religious\r\ninfluence on the political arena. These influences have brought vast\r\nmultitudes of foreign born citizens to the polls, ignorant of American\r\ninterests, without American feelings, influenced by foreign sympathies,\r\nto vote on American affairs; and those votes have, in point of fact,\r\naccomplished the present result.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly replied to the Know-Nothing leader. He said: “I rise for the\r\npurpose of submitting as briefly as I can a few remarks in reply to\r\nthe very extraordinary speech of the honorable member from Baltimore\r\ncity. In the great abundance of his zeal to assail the President of\r\nthe United States, the gentlemen from Baltimore could not permit so\r\ngood an occasion to pass without hurling his pointless invectives\r\nagainst my constituents, in terms and temper which demand a reply. * *\r\n* His ambition seems restless and insatiable, for he cannot conclude\r\nhis speech without trying a bout with what he denominates the ‘Irish\r\nBrigade.’ What particular class of our fellow-citizens this fling\r\nwas aimed at, I am at a loss to conjecture. There is a body known to\r\nhistory under that appellation—a body of historical reputation, whose\r\ndeeds of bravery on every battle-field of Europe have long formed\r\nthe glowing theme for the poet’s genius and the sculptor’s art. But,\r\nsir, they were too pure to be reached by the gentleman’s sarcasm—too\r\npatriotic to be measured by his well conned calculation of the ‘loaves\r\nand fishes’ which have unfortunately slipped through his fingers—too\r\nbrave to be terrified by the menaces or insults of those who would\r\njustify brutal murder—the murder of defenceless women and helpless\r\nchildren—the sacking of dwellings and the burning of churches, under\r\nthe insolent plea of ‘summary punishment.’ Sir, the Irish Brigade of\r\nhistory was composed of patriots whom oppression in the land of their\r\nbirth had driven to foreign countries, to carve out a home and a name\r\nby their valor and their swords. The brightest page of the history of\r\nFrance is that which records the deeds and the names of the ‘Irish\r\nBrigade.’ France, however, was not the only country in which the\r\nIrish Brigade signalized its devotion to liberty, and its bravery in\r\nachieving it. Sir, the father of your own navy was one of that glorious\r\nband of heroes who shed lustre on the land of their birth, while they\r\npoured out their life-blood for the country of their adoption. John\r\nBarry was a member of the Irish Brigade in America—he, who when tempted\r\nby Lord Howe with gold to his heart’s content, and the command of a\r\nline-of-battle-ship, spurned the offer with these noble words: ‘I have\r\ndevoted myself to the cause of my adopted country, and not the value\r\nor command of the whole British fleet could seduce me from it.’ He,\r\nwho when hailed by the British frigates in the West Indies and asked\r\nthe usual questions as to the ship and captain, answered: ‘The United\r\nStates ship Alliance, saucy Jack Barry, half-Irishman, half-Yankee.\r\nWho are you?’ Sir, saucy Jack Barry, as he styled himself, was the\r\nfirst American officer that ever hoisted the Stars and Stripes of our\r\ncountry on board a vessel of war. So soon as the flag of the Union was\r\nagreed on, it floated from the mast-head of the Lexington, Captain John\r\nBarry. But Captain John Barry was not the only member of the ‘Irish\r\nBrigade’ whose name comes down to us with the story of the privations\r\nand bravery of our revolutionary struggle. Colonel John Fitzgerald\r\nwas also a member of that immortal band. Of this member of the ‘Irish\r\nBrigade’ I will let the still living member of Washington’s own\r\nhousehold, the eloquent and venerable Custis speak:\r\n\r\n“‘Col. Fitzgerald,’ says G. W. P. Custis in his memoirs of\r\nRevolutionary Heroes, ‘was an Irish officer in the Blue and Buffs,\r\nthe first volunteer company raised in the South, in the dawn of the\r\nRevolution, and commanded by Washington. In the campaign of 1778 and\r\nretreat through the Jerseys, Fitzgerald was appointed aid-de-camp to\r\nWashington. At the battle of Princeton occurred that touching scene,\r\nconsecrated by history to everlasting remembrance. The American\r\ntroops, worn down by hardships, exhausting marches and want of food,\r\non the fall of their leader, that brave old Scotchman, General Mercer,\r\nrecoiled before the bayonets of the veteran foe. Washington spurred\r\nhis horse into the interval between the hostile lines, reigning up\r\nwith the charger’s head to the foe, and calling to his soldiers, ‘Will\r\nyou give up your General to the enemy?’ The appeal was not made in\r\nvain. The Americans faced about and the arms were leveled on both\r\nside—Washington between them—even as though he had been placed as a\r\ntarget for both. It was at this moment Colonel Fitzgerald returned\r\nfrom conveying an order to the rear—and here let us use the gallant\r\nveteran’s own words. He said: ‘On my return, I perceived the General\r\nimmediately between our line and that of the enemy, both lines leveling\r\nfor the decisive fire that was to decide the fortunes of the day.\r\nInstantly there was a roar of musketry followed by a shout. It was the\r\nshout of victory. On raising my eyes I discovered the enemy broken\r\nand flying, while dimly, amid the glimpses of the smoke, was seen\r\nWashington alive and unharmed, waving his hat and cheering his comrades\r\nto the pursuit. I dashed my rowels into my charger’s flanks and flew to\r\nhis side, exclaiming, ‘Thank God, your Excellency’s safe.’ I wept like\r\na child for joy.’”\r\n\r\n“This is what history tells us of another member of the ‘Irish\r\nBrigade.’ Now, Sir, if the gentleman from Maryland will only suppress\r\nhis horror, and listen with patience, I will tell him what tradition\r\nadds concerning this brave aid-de-camp of Washington—this bold and\r\nintrepid Irishman. After peace was proclaimed and our independence\r\nachieved—after the Constitution had been put in operation, and\r\nWashington filled the office of chief-magistrate of the nation—he sent\r\nfor his old companion in arms, then living in Washington’s own county\r\nof Fairfax, and invited him to accept the lucrative office of collector\r\nof the customs for the port of Alexandria. This tradition will be found\r\nto correspond with the records of the Treasury Department, on which may\r\nbe read the entry that Colonel John Fitzgerald was appointed collector\r\nof the customs at Alexandria, Virginia, by George Washington, President\r\nof the United States, April 12, 1792. Thus we find that the Father of\r\nhis country, were he now living, would come under the denunciations\r\nof the gentleman from Maryland, and his Know-Nothing associates, for\r\nconferring office on one of the ‘Irish Brigade.’\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from Baltimore city professes great devotion to the\r\nmemory and fame of the illustrious Clay. He was the gentleman’s\r\noracle while living. Hear his eloquent voice coming up to us as if\r\nfrom his honored grave. He, too, is speaking of the ‘Irish Brigade,’\r\nand in his warm, honest and manly soul the only words which he can\r\nfind sufficiently ardent to express his feelings are ‘bone of our\r\nbone, and flesh of our flesh.’ ‘That Ireland,’ exclaims the orator of\r\nAmerica in a speech delivered as late as 1847, ‘which has been in all\r\nthe vicissitudes of our national existence our friend, and has ever\r\nextended to us her warmest sympathy—those Irishmen who in every war\r\nin which we have been engaged, on every battle-field from Quebec to\r\nMonterey, have stood by us shoulder to shoulder and shared in all the\r\nperils and fortunes of the conflict.’ If anything, Mr. Chairman, were\r\nwanting after this to ennoble the ‘Irish Brigade,’ and give it its\r\nproper and constitutional position in the family of American freemen,\r\nit is the obloquy of His Excellency Henry J. Gardner of Massachusetts,\r\nand the Hon. Henry Winter Davis, of Baltimore.\r\n\r\n“I now propose, Mr. Chairman, to address myself for a few moments to\r\nthe honorable gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Akers), who is, I learn, a\r\nminister of the gospel. While his friend from Baltimore city exhausts\r\nall his powers upon the ‘Irish Brigade,’ he, with an equal stretch of\r\nfancy, but a much vaster stride over space, obtrudes himself at a bound\r\ninto the cabins of the Irish peasantry, far away across the Atlantic.\r\nHailing from a State first settled by Catholics, whose chief city was\r\nnamed by its pious founders after the sainted crusader King of France,\r\nthe gentleman from Missouri calls on you to hear the Irish priest\r\nbeyond the Atlantic holding converse with his enslaved parishioners.\r\nMr. Chairman, from boyhood to manhood, I have known more priests of\r\nnative and foreign birth than Mr. Akers ever saw. I have seen them at\r\nthe cradle of infancy; I have been with them at the death-bed of old\r\nage; but, sir, my ears are only those of a man; I never heard a word\r\nof the speeches the gentleman from Missouri puts into their lips. Is it\r\nnot known, sir, to every candid and impartial traveler who has visited\r\nthat beautiful but ill-fated Island that the only true, devoted, loyal,\r\nself-sacrificing friend that the Irish peasant has in the land of his\r\nbirth is the Catholic priest? He stands between him and the oppression\r\nof his haughty, blood-stained rulers; and when he cannot ameliorate his\r\ncondition he bears on his own shoulders his full share of the burden.\r\nIn suffering and misfortune he administers to him the consolations of\r\nhis religion and the counsel of a friend; he sympathizes with him in\r\nall his trials, and when the minister of a strange faith, armed with\r\nall the terrors of the law, sends his bailiffs and his minions to seize\r\nthe very bed on which his sick wife is preparing to meet the God of\r\nher fathers—when under the maddening spectacle a momentary burning for\r\nrevenge perhaps seizes upon his agonized soul—the priest is by his side\r\nwhispering in his ear ‘Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord’; takes him by\r\nthe hand, provides with his last penny for the safe removal of the sick\r\nand the helpless, and leaves them not until the hour of their trial\r\nis passed—a trial that will continue to harrass and oppress the Irish\r\nCatholic so long as the national Church of England prolongs a life of\r\ndebauchery and vice on the plunder and pillage of the Irish peasant.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly made a deep impression on the House. The Know-Nothing\r\nmembers held a consultation while he was speaking, and decided that\r\nhe must be interrupted and overcome if possible by a running fire of\r\ncross-questions. Luther M. Kennett of Missouri, formerly Mayor of St.\r\nLouis, and Lewis D. Campbell of Ohio, Chairman of the Committee of Ways\r\nand Means, were selected to open fire upon him. Mr. Kennett began by\r\nsaying, “Will the gentleman from New York allow me to interrupt him for\r\na moment?”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Certainly, sir.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennett: “I see, Mr. Chairman, that my colleague to whom the\r\ngentleman refers, is not in his seat. I will, therefore, with his\r\npermission, say that I think he has unintentionally misinterpreted my\r\ncolleague’s remarks. The inference which I drew from the argument of my\r\ncolleague on this floor was that he was opposed to the consolidation of\r\npolitical and religious questions and to the proscribing of any man on\r\naccount of his religious belief—and such are the principles and policy\r\nof the American Party. My colleague said further that the American\r\nParty was the first party that ever introduced that principle in their\r\npolitical platform.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I must insist, Mr. Chairman, with all deference to the\r\ngentleman from Missouri, that I have not misunderstood the remarks of\r\nhis colleague. I listened to his speech, as I have already said, with\r\nattention, and read it very carefully as it is printed in the _Globe_,\r\nand as it now appears in that paper to speak for itself. While I admit\r\nan apparent effort on the part of the gentleman from Missouri to _look_\r\nliberal, I must be permitted to remark that he seems no way solicitous\r\nto _talk_ liberal, and an unbiased perusal of the gross libel which he\r\nhas published in the _Globe_ concerning the Irish Catholic priesthood\r\nwill lead his colleague, however reluctantly, to the same conclusion.\r\nBut the gentleman only acts out the principles and ritual of the\r\nmidnight order, which conceals all it can, and denies everything.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennett: “I will answer the gentleman more fully in my own speech,\r\nand will here state that I am ready to answer any question he may\r\npropound.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Then I ask the gentleman did he or does he now give his\r\nadhesion to the platform of principles adopted by the American Party in\r\nPhiladelphia in February, 1856? If so, does not the gentleman by his\r\nown showing concur in the principle of proscribing Catholics because of\r\ntheir religious belief? I allude to the fifth article of the American\r\nplatform.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennett: “I will answer the gentlemen by referring him to the\r\nplatform laid down by the American Party of my State which proscribes\r\nno man because of his religious belief. And now let me further say\r\nthat the gentleman is in error when he asserts that this debate was\r\ncommenced by my colleague. It was introduced by Mr. Bowie of Maryland,\r\nin his animadversions upon his colleague, Mr. Davis.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “The gentleman certainly is in error, for Mr. Davis himself\r\nin his wild foray against the ‘Foreign Brigade,’ unnecessarily and\r\nunfoundedly attributed the defeat of his party in the last election to\r\nthe ‘religious influences’ which brought so many alien citizens to the\r\npolls. The gentleman has not, however, yet answered my question.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennett: “I am sorry I cannot suit the gentleman in my reply.\r\nHe says the Democratic party are a unit, that they everywhere fully\r\nendorsed the Kansas-Nebraska bill; I say they nevertheless claim\r\nthe largest liberty in its construction, and that construction is\r\nnotoriously different in different sections of the Union among brethren\r\nof the same political faith. Now, the American party also needed a\r\nplatform for the Presidential canvass, and that of February last was\r\nput forth for that purpose. If it was not perfect, it was the best\r\nwe could get, and we had to take it, those of us that it did not\r\nprecisely suit, with the mercantile reservation, ‘Errors excepted.’\r\nWas your President, the present occupant of the White House, elected\r\nby a majority of American-born citizens? On the contrary, without the\r\nforeign vote, which was cast for him almost unanimously, he never would\r\nhave been elevated to the position he now occupies.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Suppose he was not elected by American-born votes (which\r\nwas very likely the case), were not the principles advocated by the\r\nparty which elected Mr. Pierce national principles, without the benefit\r\ntoo of ‘Errors excepted’? Was there anything in the platform laid down\r\nat Baltimore by the convention which nominated him violative of the\r\nspirit or letter of the Constitution of the United States?”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennett: “I have not charged the contrary to be so. My point is\r\nthat the foreign-born vote holds the balance of power in our country,\r\nthat that vote is almost always on the Democratic side, and thus it\r\nshapes the policy and action of the Government. This I consider wrong.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I will say to the gentleman that the illiberal and narrow\r\npolicy parties have pursued in this country has contributed much to\r\ndrive both native and foreign-born Catholics in self-defense into the\r\nDemocratic party. That this is true is proved by the fact which you\r\nknow full well, Mr. Chairman [Mr. Humphrey Marshall], that the large\r\nCatholic vote of Kentucky and Maryland had always been found with the\r\nWhig party, until the Know-Nothing monster and its protean brood of\r\nplatforms drove them in self-respect as well as in self-defence into\r\nthe ranks of the national Democracy, where they have found repose and\r\npeace under the broad shadows of the Constitution. I will add further,\r\nthat with the exception of two terms the administration of this\r\nGovernment has been in the hands of the Democratic party. It appears to\r\nme, therefore, that the fact that the foreign-born population, in the\r\nexercise of the elective franchise being always found on the side of\r\nthe dominant party, is rather doubtful evidence that they are not as\r\nloyal to the country as any other class of voters. The high state of\r\nprosperity which the country has attained under Democratic rule would,\r\nI should think, lead to quite a different conclusion.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennett: “The Democratic party have been sharper and more\r\nsuccessful hitherto in bidding for their votes than we. Not that we\r\nwould not have won them too, had it been in our power. Office-seekers\r\nare all in love with German honesty and the ‘sweet Irish brogue.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell, of Ohio: “I have no desire to interrupt the gentleman\r\nfrom Missouri, or to interfere with the very interesting colloquy\r\nbetween him and the gentleman from New York. I have had something to\r\ndo with this matter of Americanism myself; something to do with the\r\ntariff, and, like the gentleman from Missouri, I have been a Whig.\r\nI think the greatest statesman of America was stricken down by a\r\nreligious influence.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “To whom does the gentleman refer?”\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell: “I refer to Mr. Clay of Kentucky. I well remember when\r\nhe was last a candidate—in 1844—that there was an individual on the\r\nticket with him—a distinguished gentleman, Theodore Frelinghuysen and I\r\nknow of my own personal knowledge that a priest of the Catholic Church\r\nsaid that because Theodore Frelinghuysen was placed on the ticket for\r\nVice-President, therefore the influence of the Catholic Church of the\r\nUnited States would be exercised against the ticket.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Supposing this to be so, does the gentleman mean to argue\r\nthat because an individual Catholic priest used such a remark it is\r\nsufficient ground upon which to condemn and disfranchise the four\r\nmillions of Catholics in this country?”\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell: “No, sir, by no means; nor would I interfere with their\r\nreligion, even though it was true that they had done so. The point I\r\nmake is this: That because Theodore Frelinghuysen was nominated on\r\nthe ticket with Henry Clay, who was recognized as one of the greatest\r\nstatesmen of his age, the influence of the Catholic Church—I mean\r\nespecially that of the foreign Catholic Church, I do not include the\r\nAmerican Catholic Church—was brought to bear against him; and wherever\r\nyou find a foreign Catholic vote in referring to the election of 1844\r\nyou will find, particularly in your large cities where the power was\r\nwielded, that the power was exercised for the prostration of Harry of\r\nthe West, for the reason, as admitted to me in person by a priest of\r\nyour church, that Theodore Frelinghuysen was a leading Presbyterian\r\nand President of the American Protestant Bible Society; and it is\r\nagainst that spirit on the part of foreign Catholic influence in this\r\ncountry, which has sought to control, through the power of its Church,\r\nthe destinies of this great nation that I make war.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Allow me to say that I am a native-horn citizen of Irish\r\nparents; and I wish to say to this House, and to the country, that no\r\nsuch feelings actuate the Catholic Christians of this Republic. There\r\nmay be individual cases, but I deny that such influences have anything\r\nto do with the Catholic population. And Mr. Clay himself, in writing a\r\nletter on this very subject in the canvass referred to, made a public\r\nacknowledgement that he had as much confidence in the Catholic people\r\nas he had in any other religious sect in this Union. That letter was\r\npublished in a speech which I made in this House last session, and the\r\ngentleman from Ohio can find it in the records of the House. To convict\r\nthe gentleman from Ohio, however, of misrepresenting Harry of the West\r\nin this matter, I will again quote the same extract from the letter\r\nreferred to:\r\n\r\n“‘Nor is my satisfaction diminished by the fact that we happen to be of\r\ndifferent creeds; for I never have believed that that of the Catholic\r\nwas anti-American and hostile to civil liberty. On the contrary, I have\r\nwith great pleasure and with sincere conviction, on several public\r\noccasions, borne testimony to my perfect persuasion that Catholics were\r\nas much devoted to civil liberty, and as much animated by patriotism as\r\nthose who belong to the Protestant creed.’”\r\n\r\n“I have already quoted from Mr. Clay’s speech delivered in 1847, four\r\nyears afterwards, enough to show that his views and sentiments in\r\nreference to foreign-born voters and religious creeds underwent no\r\nchange. But it was ever Mr. Clay’s misfortune to be damaged by his\r\nfriends. We have proof this evening that the fatality follows him to\r\nthe grave.”\r\n\r\nIn this debate, Mr. Kelly, who was the only Catholic in Congress,\r\nsustained the concentrated charge of the leading Know-Nothing members,\r\nand in the estimation of the House had the best of the argument over\r\nthem all. His speech was published and read throughout all parts of the\r\nUnion, and was received with manifestations of approval and pride by\r\nDemocrats generally, but especially by Catholics and adopted citizens.\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated Hayne-Webster debate in the Senate of the United\r\nStates on the Foot Resolution in 1830, Andrew Jackson, then President,\r\nwas so much pleased with Col. Hayne’s speech that he caused a number\r\nof copies to be struck off on satin, and placed one of them on the\r\nwalls of his library in the White House.[9] The speech of John Kelly,\r\nfrom which the preceding extracts are taken, was also published\r\non satin, and is still preserved in many households throughout the\r\ncountry as a souvenir of the dark days of Know-Nothingism, and of the\r\ngallant stand that was made in the House of Representatives against the\r\nproscriptionists by the future leader of the New York Democracy.\r\n\r\nDuring another debate in Congress—that of May 5, 1858—on the bill for\r\nthe admission of Minnesota into the Union, introduced by Alexander H.\r\nStephens, Chairman of the Committee on Territories, Henry Winter Davis\r\nagain attacked those he called “unnaturalized foreigners;” and Mr. John\r\nSherman, then a member of the House, and at present a Senator from\r\nOhio, and a recent aspirant for the Presidency, declared that “Ohio\r\nnever did allow unnaturalized foreigners to vote, and never will.” Mr.\r\nMuscoe R. H. Garnett, of Virginia, made a fierce attack on the same\r\nclass, designating them as the “outpourings of every foreign hive that\r\ncannot support its own citizens.” When these tirades were made, Mr.\r\nKelly rose to address the House in reply, but so bitter was the native\r\nAmerican feeling on the subject, and especially since his refutation of\r\nthe sectarian and anti-foreign speech of Davis in the preceding year,\r\nthat John Sherman resorted to every parliamentary quibble to cut off\r\nKelly’s speech. “Gentlemen here,” Mr. Kelly said, “directed many of\r\ntheir arguments against emigration and against the naturalization of\r\nforeigners. I intend to confine my remarks to that particular branch of\r\nthe subject.” At this point Mr. Sherman objected.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman, of Ohio: “I rise to a question of order. The rule requires\r\nthat the debate shall be pertinent to the question before the House. If\r\nthe gentleman desires to make a speech upon the benefits of emigration\r\nI hope he will make it in Committee of the Whole. Such debate is not in\r\norder here.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “What I shall say will be pertinent to the issue before the\r\nHouse.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman: “I insist on my question of order. I would inquire whether\r\nthe subject of emigration, which is manifestly the question which the\r\ngentleman intends to discuss, is debatable on this bill? I do not wish\r\nto embarrass the gentleman, but desire, if he wants to debate that\r\nsubject, that he shall do it in the Committee of the Whole on the state\r\nof the Union.” This objection by Mr. Sherman to Mr. Kelly’s continuing\r\nthe discussion which he himself had just been indulging in, shows\r\nthat Kelly’s method of handling the subject was not relished by the\r\nproscriptionists. Elihu B. Washburn, of Illinois, afterwards Minister\r\nto France, here interposed in favor of fair play.\r\n\r\nMr. Washburn: “I hope by unanimous consent the gentleman from New York\r\nwill be permitted to continue his speech. He is upon the floor now, and\r\nthe matter of naturalization is involved more or less in the merits of\r\nthe question before the House.” But Mr. Sherman was ready with another\r\nquibble.\r\n\r\nMr. Sherman: “If unanimous consent be given, I am willing to go\r\ninto Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union and allow the\r\ngentleman to speak, but I must object to it in the House.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wright, of Georgia: “I would remark that the gentleman from\r\nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) introduced this particular subject yesterday,\r\nand occupied twenty-five minutes in its discussion.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “It is singular that gentlemen should make objection,\r\nwhen it is a well-known fact that the whole discussion on this bill\r\nhas directed itself to that particular point. But I think there is a\r\ndisposition on the part of the House to let me go on.”\r\n\r\nSeveral Members: “There is; go ahead.”\r\n\r\nThe Speaker: “Does the Chair understand that unanimous consent is given\r\nto the gentleman’s proceeding?”\r\n\r\nMr. Lovejoy: “Not unless he is in order.”\r\n\r\nMr. Morris, of Pennsylvania: “I object; because if the gentleman is\r\nallowed to proceed, other gentlemen must be allowed to speak in reply,\r\nand thus we would have a general debate in violation of the rules of\r\nthe House, and I will not agree to violating the rules of the House.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Inasmuch as there are objections I withdraw my appeal. I do\r\nnot desire to force myself upon the House.”\r\n\r\nThus did the Know-Nothings wince under the lash of John Kelly of New\r\nYork. Had he chosen to insist, he would have been heard, for he was\r\nnow one of the leaders of the House, and the majority would have found\r\na way to secure him the floor. He was the most formidable enemy of\r\nthe Know-Nothings in the Northern States, for he knew how to act as\r\nwell as to talk. Dreamers and visionaries write fine theories, but\r\nonly great men reduce them to practice. Mr. Kelly’s youth and early\r\nmanhood were passed at a period when native American bigotry and\r\nintolerance were burning questions in State and National affairs. He\r\nhad been taught by observation, and a study of the fathers of the\r\ngovernment, that the best service he could render his country was to\r\nmake war on Know-Nothingism. He had met the leaders of that party\r\nin their strongholds in the city of New York, and vanquished them.\r\nBefore his day there were clubs and factions, and local leaders and\r\ncaptains of bands—Bill Poole and his Know-Nothings, Isaiah Rynders and\r\nhis Empire Club, Arthur Tappan and his Abolitionists, Mike Walsh and\r\nhis Spartans, Samuel J. Tilden and his Barnburners, Charles O’Conor\r\nand his Hunkers—but the born captain had not appeared to mould the\r\ndiscordant elements to his will, and make them do the work that was\r\nto be done. When John Kelly struck the blow at Know-Nothingism at the\r\nprimary election on the corner of Grand and Elizabeth streets, already\r\ndescribed, and drove out the ballot-box stuffers, the people of New\r\nYork instantaneously recognized a man behind that blow, and everybody\r\nfelt better for the discovery. When he ran against the celebrated\r\nMike Walsh for Congress, one of the most popular characters who ever\r\nfigured in New York politics, and beat him, the native American\r\nproscriptionists were glad that John Kelly was out of the way, for\r\nwhile they feared him in local politics, they persuaded themselves\r\nthat he would be swallowed up in obscurity among the great men at\r\nWashington, and that he would be heard of no more. Given a big idea\r\nlodged in the centre of a big man’s head, and be sure fruit will\r\nspring from the seed. Kelly carried his idea with him to Congress, and\r\nhostility to Know-Nothingism marked his career there, as it had done at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWhen James Buchanan became President, John Kelly became one of\r\nthe leaders of the Administration party in Congress. He was then\r\nthirty-four years old. One day General Cass, Secretary of State,\r\nvisited the Capitol, and in conversation with a friend said: “Look at\r\nJohn Kelly moving about quietly among the members. The man is full of\r\nlatent power that he scarcely dreams of himself. He is equal to half a\r\ndozen of those fellows around him. Yes, by all odds, the biggest man\r\namong them all. The country will yet hear from Honest John Kelly.”\r\nThese words of General Cass, uttered in his imposing George-the-Third\r\nstyle of conversation, shortly after were repeated to old James\r\nGordon Bennett, the friend of Kelly’s boyhood, and the editor took\r\nearly opportunity to mention Honest John Kelly in the _Herald_, and\r\nfrequently afterwards applied the same title to him. The appellation\r\nstruck the public as appropriate, and soon passed into general use.\r\nThe subject of this memoir has been called “Honest John Kelly,” from\r\nthat day to this. In a letter to the present writer, in 1880, the late\r\nAlexander H. Stephens said: “I have stood by John Kelly in his entire\r\nstruggle, and have often said, and now repeat, that I regard him as the\r\nablest, purest and truest statesman that I have ever met with from New\r\nYork.”\r\n\r\nMr. Buchanan was urged by Mr. Kelly to appoint Augustus Schell\r\nCollector of the Port of New York. Other members of the New York\r\ndelegation in the House, and both the New York Senators opposed the\r\nselection of Mr. Schell. Mr. Seward was vehement in his opposition. But\r\nJohn Kelly stuck with the tenacity of Stanton in the War Department,\r\nor Stonewall Jackson in the battle-field. The President nominated\r\nMr. Schell Senator Clay of Alabama reported the nomination favorably\r\nfrom the Committee of Commerce, William H. Seward and the others were\r\noverborne, and Mr. Schell was confirmed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Kelly entered upon his political career, to be a foreigner, or\r\nthe son of a foreigner, in New York, in the opinion of the intolerant\r\nof both parties, was deemed a matter that required an apology, or at\r\nleast an explanation. In 1857 one of the leading representative men of\r\nthe Federal Administration in New York was John Kelly, and those who\r\nhad been persecuted and oppressed before were recognized and advanced\r\nequally with all others in the city and State of New York; and the\r\nvanishing Know-Nothings at last realized that the absent Kelly had\r\ndealt them heavier blows from Washington than he ever delivered in New\r\nYork. In these later and happier days men are no longer ashamed to be\r\ncalled the sons of Irishmen, and at the festive board of the Irish\r\nsocieties the notable ones of the country gather to make eloquent\r\nspeeches and drink rousing toasts. But while some men forget, true\r\nIrishmen and true descendants of Irishmen have not forgotten their\r\nHoratius at the bridge in the brave days of old. John Kelly, were he\r\na man of vanity, in contrasting the auspicious scenes of to-day with\r\nthose of the dark days of 1844 and 1854, and in viewing his own part in\r\neffecting the change, could not fail to find much cause for pride and\r\ncomplacent reflection; but vanity is not his weakness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _John Kelly_\r\n\r\n(AT THE AGE OF 35 YEARS.)]\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly went to Washington in the winter of 1855 to succeed the\r\nbrilliant Mike Walsh in the House of Representatives. How did the\r\nweighty statesmen receive him? He went into their midst a big-boned,\r\nheavy-browed, brawny stranger, with his far-seeing eye, and firm solid\r\nstep, and as he strode in among the Solons of Washington they all felt\r\nan instantaneous conviction from his conversation and bearing that in\r\nthe society of the most eminent men of the Republic John Kelly was\r\nexactly where he was entitled to be. He flattered no great man by the\r\nleast symptom of being himself flattered by his notice. He measured his\r\nstrength in discussion with the most celebrated men in Congress, and\r\nfeared the face of none. At their social gatherings he responded to the\r\nbrilliant _bon mots_ of the wits of the capital by quiet strokes of\r\nhumor, and anecdote, and story, that sent bursts of merriment through\r\nthe circle, delighting the sensible, and penetrating even those who\r\nencased themselves in triple folds of aristocratic reserve.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing artificial about him, but he has been always, and was\r\nso particularly in those days, the child of nature, with no shadow\r\nof pretension or affectation in his manners. He was not simply a man\r\nlifted up from the ranks of toil to be noticed by the world’s favored\r\nones, but he was endowed with that greatness of soul which always\r\ndistinguishes its possessor above his fellows, whether his lot be cast\r\nin the highest or lowest situation of life. It is not strange that New\r\nYork has felt, and will continue to feel, the moral influence of this\r\nman as long as he continues to take part in its affairs, loved by the\r\nmasses for his lion-like courage, and by friends who meet him face to\r\nface in retirement for his almost womanly gentleness, while for obvious\r\nreasons he is hated and vilified by those who do not appreciate such\r\nqualities. And this courage and gentleness and unruffled equanimity\r\ncome all in a breath, perfectly natural and free, for they come of\r\ntheir own accord. His composure under all circumstances has often\r\nbeen remarked upon, and in the hurly-burly of New York politics, and\r\nthe headlong rush of the tide of life in the great metropolis, John\r\nKelly is as sedate and recollected as the ascetic in his cloister. But\r\nthere is nothing of sourness in his temper. Reflecting much at all\r\ntimes, he possesses the rare gift of thinking while he is talking,\r\nand when he is expressing one idea his thoughts never outrun the\r\npresent sentence, as do those of nine-tenths of people, to frame words\r\nfor the next one. He does not, in short, think of what he is going\r\nto say next, but of what he is saying now. Among the finer shades\r\nof character that distinguish one man from another it is extremely\r\ndifficult to define that untranslatable something which gives to each\r\nperson his individuality; but this intentness of Mr. Kelly upon the\r\nimmediate subject under consideration, both as listener and talker, is\r\nwonderfully attractive, and constitutes one of the subtle forces of his\r\ncharacter as a political leader. This faculty of concentration belongs\r\nexclusively to original minds. Self-reliant, and borrowing nothing\r\nfrom others as to style or conduct, he gets at the point without\r\nlabored approaches, and acts great parts with a happy carelessness.\r\nWhen others have been cast down and worried with care over affairs in\r\nwhich Mr. Kelly was more interested than themselves, his elastic spirit\r\nhas not given way. Loving thus the sunshine, he affords a conspicuous\r\nexample of the truth of the inspired words, “a merry man doeth good\r\nlike a medicine.” Nothing has ever dispelled his cheerfulness. Defeat,\r\ndeprivation of office, desertion by those he trusted, and who owed all\r\nthey were to him, have neither embittered him, cast him down, daunted\r\nhis courage, nor shaken his faith in himself. Domestic afflictions such\r\nas few men ever know—the death of his entire family—have come upon\r\nhim, and while the keen shaft scarred the granite, his constancy has\r\nremained, and neither head nor chastened heart succumbed to misanthropy\r\nor rebellion against Providence. Surely something more substantial than\r\nwit, or genius, or equable temper was required to sustain John Kelly in\r\nthe trials he has borne. The natural can only accomplish the natural,\r\nbut a good man draws from supernatural fountains to replenish the\r\nwell-springs in the arid plains of the desert, and Christianity, not\r\nfor holiday show but daily use, must have been this man’s sheet-anchor.\r\n\r\nThose acquainted with Mr. Kelly will be proper judges of the fidelity\r\nor shortcomings of this picture. They who have read the absurd\r\ndelineations of him in some of the newspapers, and accept them without\r\nmore inquiry as reliable, may reject this description of his character\r\nas contradictory of their preconceived notions on the subject. There is\r\na third class of witnesses—an increasing class—perhaps more impartial\r\nthan the two former ones, whose testimony on the point is important.\r\nThese are strangers who have formed violent prejudices against the man\r\nafter reading certain newspapers, but who on becoming acquainted with\r\nhim repudiate their own opinions as rash and preposterously unjust.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” but say his enemies, “this is not a fair test; Kelly is plausible\r\nand fair-spoken, and has great personal magnetism. Strangers when\r\nthey meet him fall under his spell.” The objection is a weak one, for\r\nthese strangers never relapse into their former absurd opinions after\r\nthey have gone away, and withdrawn themselves out of his spell. Let\r\nsuch strangers decide as to the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the\r\npicture sketched here. A case of the kind occurred at the Cincinnati\r\nDemocratic Convention in 1880. A delegate to the Convention from the\r\nState of Rhode Island was very severe on John Kelly. He had been\r\nreading an unfriendly newspaper. He denounced him as a boss, and\r\nuttered many just sentiments on the evils of bossism. While he was\r\nspeaking John Kelly and Augustus Schell passed by, and the former was\r\npointed out to him. “Is that Kelly?” said he. “Well, he doesn’t look\r\nmuch like a New York rough, or bar-room bully anyhow. I have been told\r\nhe was both.” An introduction followed, and a conversation took place\r\nbetween the delegate and the subject of his recent execrations. “I am\r\ngreatly obliged to you,” said the Rhode Island delegate to the author\r\nof this memoir, who gave the introduction, after Mr. Kelly had parted\r\nfrom him and re-joined Mr. Schell. “I honestly detested John Kelly, as\r\na low, ignorant ward politician, who had conducted a gang of rowdies\r\nto this Convention to try and overawe it. So I had been told again\r\nand again. Now I don’t believe a word of it. I never talked to a more\r\nsensible man, and modest gentleman than John Kelly. This opens my eyes\r\nto the whole business.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of this chapter particular attention has been directed to\r\nMr. Kelly’s war on Know-Nothingism as his chief claim to distinction\r\nand the gratitude of his country during his younger days. He became\r\nidentified with the cause of equal rights in the minds of adopted\r\ncitizens of various nationalities, especially of the Irish, and\r\ncontributed as much, after Henry A. Wise, towards the overthrow of\r\nthe Know-Nothing party, as any man in the United States. The adopted\r\ncitizens were proud of their champion, and the place which he gained\r\nin their affections became so deep that, like Daniel O’Connell in\r\nIreland, he could sway them by his simple word as completely as a\r\ngeneral at the head of his army directs its movements. Mr. Kelly never\r\nabused this confidence, and consequently has retained his influence\r\nto the present day. Many have marvelled at his hold on the people of\r\nNew York, as great when out of power, as when he has had the patronage\r\nof office at his disposal. Among the causes which have conspired to\r\ngive him the largest Personal following of any man of the present\r\ngeneration, his patriotic services in the old Native American and\r\nKnow-Nothing days must be reckoned among the chief. Such a hold Dean\r\nSwift had upon Irishmen in the eighteenth century. Nothing could break\r\nit, nothing weaken it, the King on his throne could not withstand the\r\nauthor of the Drapier’s Letters in his obscure Deanery in Ireland. It\r\nis fortunate John Kelly is a just and honest man, unmoved by clamor,\r\nnot to be bribed by place or power, nor seduced by the temptations of\r\nambition; for were it otherwise, his sway over great multitudes of\r\nmen might enable him to lead them to the right or left, whichsoever\r\nway he might list, a momentous power for good or evil. The politician\r\nwho ignores this man’s influence, the historian who omits it from his\r\ncalculation of causes, has not looked below the surface of things, and\r\nknows nothing of the real state of affairs in the city and State of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nAlexander H. Stephens was acquainted with John Kelly for over a quarter\r\nof a century; came into daily contact with him for four years on the\r\nfloor of Congress; served with him for two years on the Committee of\r\nWays and Means in the House; and his estimate of Mr. Kelly’s character,\r\nreferred to at a former page, is entitled to respectful consideration\r\nfrom every man in the United States, especially on the part of those\r\nwho know nothing about him except what they have read in partisan\r\nnewspapers. “I have often said, and now repeat,” declared Georgia’s\r\ngreat Commoner, “that I regard John Kelly as the ablest, purest and\r\ntruest statesman that I have ever met with from New York.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Cleveland’s Life of A.

The old Federal party and its several legitimate\r\nsuccessors, more especially the Whigs and Know-Nothings, had not been\r\nfortunate in their conflicts with the Democratic party. Founded by\r\nMr. Jefferson, the latter party always had been distinguished for\r\ntwo central ideas—a strict construction of the Constitution, and\r\nadherence to the minimum scale of governmental powers. The Federalists\r\nhad destroyed themselves as a national organization by opposition\r\nto the war of 1812. General Jackson declared he would have hung the\r\nmen who burned blue lights at New London, when Commodore Decatur was\r\nblockaded there by the British fleet.[10] These blue lights were said\r\nto be signals to the enemy of the movements of the American forces.\r\nThe exposure by John Quincy Adams of the machinations at Boston of\r\nJohn Henry, the British emissary and spy, who was sent from Canada\r\nto instill treason in New England and bring about the secession of\r\nthe Eastern States,[11] had hardly less effect in sealing the fate\r\nof the Federal party than the Hartford Convention, whose object was\r\nthe dissolution of the Union. Massachusetts—not South Carolina—was\r\nthe birthplace of the secession doctrine.[12] The extinction of the\r\nFederal party was followed by the “era of good feeling.” Then came\r\nthe disruption during the administration of John Quincy Adams, who\r\nhaving first propitiated Jefferson and Madison by making war on the\r\nHartford Convention and the Essex Junto, in the end showed he was a\r\nFederalist at heart by reviving the principles which had distinguished\r\nhis father’s administration, and opening the way for the formation\r\nof the Whig party by fastening the protective system on the country,\r\nand deducing implied powers from the Constitution not found in\r\nthat instrument. The inevitable tendency of these revived ideas of\r\nfederalism was towards the centralization of all powers, whether\r\ndelegated or not, in the General Government. The Whig party, though led\r\nby the brilliant Henry Clay, was no match for the Democratic party.\r\nTwice it succeeded in wresting the government from the Democrats, but\r\non each occasion the result was due to Democratic dissensions, and to\r\nthe furore excited over the name of a military chieftain—Harrison in\r\n1840, and Taylor in 1848. With Clay and Webster the Whig party died,\r\nand was succeeded by Know-Nothingism. Mr. Kelly’s part in the overthrow\r\nof the American or Know-Nothing party was dwelt upon in the last\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nBut the old Federal party, so unsuccessful with the Hartford\r\nConvention, and in its opposition to the second war with England; so\r\nshort-lived in its regained supremacy under the Whigs; and so easily\r\noverthrown under its bigoted organization of Know-Nothingism; was at\r\nlength about to adopt a new course, and to acquire a new vitality in\r\nits war with the party of the Constitution, the Jeffersonian Democracy,\r\ndestined to place it in control of the government for a quarter of\r\na century, and to revolutionize the institutions of the country, if\r\nnot the principles of the Constitution itself. Agitation over negro\r\nslavery furnished the anti-Jefferson party with this new lease of\r\nlife. That agitation became the burning question in American politics\r\nwhile Mr. Kelly was in Congress. A maximum of government was now to\r\nbe employed, and the disciples of Mr. Jefferson, divided and routed,\r\nwere soon to behold the Hamiltonian school of politicians in absolute\r\ncontrol of every department of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThe commanding influence of New York in the affairs of the United\r\nStates was never more conspicuously displayed than at the time of the\r\ndissolution of the Whig and organization of the Republican parties.\r\nDissensions among the Democrats of New York proved a potent factor in\r\nthis process of decay and rejuvenation among their opponents. Prior to\r\n1848 the Abolitionists had no strength as a party organization. Mobbed\r\nin Boston, New York and other cities, denounced by Daniel Webster as\r\n“infernal Abolitionists,” and by Henry Clay as “mad fanatics,” they\r\nstruggled in vain for long years to effect a lodgment in American\r\npolitics. A rapid glance at the origin of political Abolitionism will\r\nnot be without interest to the historical student. Forty-four years\r\nago, January 28-29, 1840, an anti-slavery convention was held at\r\nArcade, then in Genessee County, New York. Reuben Sleeper of Livingston\r\nCounty presided. Among the delegates were Myron Holley and Gerrit\r\nSmith. At this conclave a call was issued for a national convention,\r\nto be held at Albany April 1, 1840, to discuss the expediency of\r\nnominating Abolition candidates for President and Vice-President of\r\nthe United States. At the time and place appointed the first national\r\nconvention of the anti-slavery party was held. Alvan Stewart presided,\r\nand the Liberty Party, after a long discussion, was organized. The\r\nconvention was composed of delegates from six States. James G. Birney\r\nand Thomas Earle were nominated for President and Vice-President. They\r\nreceived a little less than 7,000 votes at the polls, the Harrison and\r\nTyler tidal wave sweeping everything before it. In 1844 the Liberty\r\nParty again placed its candidates in the field—James G. Birney for\r\nPresident and Thomas Morris for Vice-President—who polled nearly\r\n60,000 votes, and defeated Henry Clay. The politicians were not slow\r\nto perceive that the Abolitionists at last held the balance of power\r\nbetween the two national parties of Whigs and Democrats. But no one\r\nthen dreamed that Martin Van Buren, who had achieved all his successes\r\nin life as a Democrat, whom the South had made President in 1836,\r\nand whom John Randolph described as the “Northern man with Southern\r\nprinciples,” would place himself at the head of the Abolitionists in\r\n1848, and thereby defeat his own party at the Presidential election\r\nof that year. In this surprising defection of Mr. Van Buren from the\r\nDemocratic party, Samuel J. Tilden likewise struck his colors and\r\nwent off with the Little Magician into the camp of the Abolitionists.\r\nLucius Robinson also bolted with Tilden. John Kelly followed the lead\r\nof William L. Marcy and Horatio Seymour, and supported Cass and Butler,\r\nthe nominees of the National Democracy.\r\n\r\nA convention of the Liberty Party was held at Macedon Locke, Wayne\r\ncounty, New York, June 8, 9 and 10, 1847, at which the Abolitionists\r\nnominated Gerrit Smith and Elihu Burritt for President and\r\nVice-President. Burritt declined, and at a convention held soon after\r\nat Rochester, New York, Charles C. Foote was nominated in Burritt’s\r\nplace. The politicians now began to put in their fine work. The\r\nnational committee of the Liberty Party and their outside advisers had\r\ntheir own plans with which the nomination of Gerrit Smith conflicted.\r\nThey accordingly called another convention of the Liberty Party to\r\nmeet at Buffalo, October 20, 1847. The Macedon convention thereupon\r\nseparated from the Liberty Party, and took the name of Liberty\r\nLeague. Both wings were in agreement in maintaining that slavery was\r\nunconstitutional. William Lloyd Garrison and his followers, while\r\nnot endorsing the Liberty Party in all things, held that a rising\r\nof the slaves in the Southern States would be no “insurrection.” In\r\nthis view the Abolition editors concurred, as did also the Liberty\r\nParty conventions in Massachusetts and other Eastern States, those\r\nheld in various parts of New York, and those convened in Ohio and\r\nother Western States. The Liberty League occupied the same ground\r\nin regard to slavery, with this difference: they took position on\r\nother public questions which the Liberty Party excluded from the\r\nscope of its operations. Gerrit Smith, who was one of the single idea\r\nAbolitionists, in fact their leader, was placed in nomination for the\r\nPresidency at the Buffalo Liberty Party Convention of October 20,\r\n1847. His candidature would have received the hearty support of the\r\nLiberty League, for its members knew that a servile insurrection was\r\nwhat he desired. Thirteen years later Gerrit Smith supplied John Brown\r\nwith the money to carry out his notorious Harper’s Ferry raid, the\r\nrevelation of which fact in Frothingham’s biography of Gerrit Smith\r\nled to the suppression of the book by the friends of the latter. The\r\nmanagers of the convention passed over Mr. Smith, and for the first\r\ntime went outside of their own ranks for candidates. John P. Hale,\r\nof New Hampshire, and Leicester King, of Ohio, were nominated for\r\nPresident and Vice-President. These nominations were only temporary.\r\nIn 1848 the Barnburners of New York were in open revolt against the\r\nDemocrats, bolted at the National Democratic Convention of Baltimore,\r\nand held a convention of their own at Utica. The anti-slavery Whigs\r\nof Massachusetts and the followers of Joshua R. Giddings and Salmon\r\nP. Chase in Ohio were ready to unite with the Abolitionists of the\r\nLiberty Party. A conference was held by the leaders of these various\r\ndiscordant factions, secessionists from the two old parties, which\r\nled to the call for the celebrated Buffalo Convention of August 9,\r\n1848. In that Convention was born the Republican party of to-day. The\r\nLiberty Party was swallowed up, Hale and King withdrew, the name of\r\nFree Soil party was assumed, and two men never before considered as\r\ndistinctive Abolitionists, Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams,\r\nwere nominated for President and Vice-President. “A party has arisen,”\r\nsaid Daniel Webster with vitriolic humor in a speech at Abington,\r\nMassachusetts, October 9, 1848, “which calls itself the Free Soil\r\nparty. I think there is a good joke by Swift, who wished to ridicule\r\nsome one who was making no very tasteful use of the words ‘_natale\r\nsolum_’:\r\n\r\n    “‘_Libertas, et natale solum!_\r\n      Fine words. I wonder where you stole ’em.’”\r\n\r\nThomas H. Benton, the Jackson Democrat and friend and champion of Van\r\nBuren in the long struggle between the latter and Calhoun, added his\r\ncondemnation to that of Webster, the New England Whig. Of the Free\r\nSoil party, which was launched on its stormy career at the Buffalo\r\nConvention, Benton says in his “Thirty Years’ View”: “It was an\r\norganization entirely to be regretted. Its aspect was sectional,\r\nits foundation a single idea, and its tendency to merge political\r\nprinciples in a slavery contention. And deeming all such organizations,\r\nno matter on which side of the question, as fraught with evil to the\r\nUnion, this writer, on the urgent request of some of his political\r\nassociates, went to New York to interpose his friendly offices to\r\nget the Free Soil organization abandoned; but in vain. Mr. Van Buren\r\naccepted the nomination, and in so doing placed himself in opposition\r\nto the general tenor of his political conduct in relation to slavery. I\r\ndeemed this acceptance unfortunate to a degree far beyond its influence\r\nupon persons or parties. It went to impair confidence between the North\r\nand the South, and to narrow down the basis of party organization to\r\na single idea; and that idea not known to our ancestors as an element\r\nin political organizations. Although another would have been nominated\r\nif he (Van Buren) had refused, yet no other nomination could have\r\ngiven such emphasis to the character of the convention and done as\r\nmuch harm.”[13] The vote in 1848 was as follows: Taylor and Fillmore,\r\n1,360,752; Cass and Butler, 1,219,962; Van Buren and Adams, 291,342.\r\nMr. Van Buren was assisted very warmly in this crusade against the\r\nNational Democratic party by Samuel J. Tilden and Lucius Robinson, and\r\nhaving effected his object in joining the Abolitionists, the defeat of\r\nGeneral Cass, he turned his back on his new allies in a single year and\r\nreturned to the Democratic fold. But the “harm” predicted by Benton had\r\nbeen done, and the prodigal’s return could not undo it. It was by such\r\nexploits that Mr. Van Buren won the title of “Fox of Kinderhook.”\r\n\r\nFour years later, in 1852, the Free Soil party again held a national\r\nconvention, and nominated for President and Vice-President John P. Hale\r\nof New Hampshire, and George W. Julian of Indiana. They polled 157,685\r\nvotes at the election.\r\n\r\nAt the succeeding Presidential election the Whig party was dead, and\r\nthe seed sown at the Buffalo Convention of 1848 by the Free Soilers had\r\nflowered in the interval into its natural fruit—the Republican party,\r\na sectional organization founded on the single idea of opposition\r\nto slavery. The mission of this party was proclaimed by its leader.\r\nWilliam H. Seward, to be an “irrepressible conflict” between a solid\r\nNorth and a solid South. John C. Fremont and William L. Dayton were\r\nnominated for President and Vice-President by the Republican National\r\nConvention of 1856. Francis P. Blair, Mr. Van Buren’s old friend of\r\nthe _Globe_, was the political inventor of Colonel Fremont. Buchanan\r\nreceived 1,838,169 votes, Fremont 1,341,264, and Fillmore 874,534.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden was now back in the Democratic party, and acting in\r\nharmonious accord with Mr. Kelly. Not so Mr. Lucius Robinson.\r\nThis gentleman, whose famous gubernatorial contest with Mr. Kelly\r\ntwenty-three years later attracted national attention, and operated\r\ndisastrously on the fortunes of Mr. Tilden, now left the Democrats\r\nand joined the Republican party. At a Fremont convention held at\r\nSyracuse, New York, July 25, 1856, resolutions denouncing the\r\nDemocratic conventions, State and National, were adopted. The committee\r\nreporting these resolutions, of which Lucius Robinson was a member,\r\nalso submitted an address which was adopted. “Mr. Buchanan,” it was\r\nsaid in this address, “the candidate of the Cincinnati Convention,\r\nstands pledged to make the resolutions of that convention his rule\r\nof practice. Such a candidate, under such circumstances, we cannot\r\nsupport. Mr. Fremont, who has been nominated by the Republicans,\r\nis an acceptable choice. In his hands the Presidential office\r\nwill be vigorously and justly administered. We have, therefore,\r\nnominated him for the Presidency, and his associate Mr. Dayton, for\r\nthe Vice-Presidency, and will use every honorable effort to secure\r\ntheir election, that we may rescue the Presidential office from the\r\ndegradation into which it has fallen, and the politics of the country\r\nfrom the corruption which is fast undermining our best institutions.”\r\nMr. Robinson’s committee also arraigned President Pierce for the\r\n“deplorable misrule of the present administration.”\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Lucius Robinson continued to be an active Republican.\r\nIn 1876 when Mr. Tilden insisted on that gentleman’s nomination as\r\nDemocratic candidate for Governor of New York, Mr. Kelly called Mr.\r\nTilden’s attention to the record of his candidate, and advised against\r\nhis nomination. As Mr. Tilden still insisted, and was himself the\r\nDemocratic candidate for President, Mr. Kelly gave Mr. Robinson his\r\nsupport, in order not to weaken the national ticket. Robinson was\r\nelected Governor. His administration will long be memorable for the\r\nproscriptive policy adopted by the Governor against a respectable\r\nand powerful wing of the Democratic party. He surrounded himself\r\nwith an inner council, or star chamber, and stretched the Executive\r\nprerogative of arraigning and removing Democratic officials to the\r\nverge of tyranny. It soon became evident that no Democrat, howsoever\r\nirreproachable in the walks of life, who did not belong to the\r\nGovernor’s faction, and who might be reached by Mr. Robinson, could\r\ncount on his safety in office, or feel himself secure for an hour from\r\nthe vengeance of the Executive. To follow John Kelly, or to adhere to\r\nthe Tammany Hall Democracy, became an atrocious crime in the estimation\r\nof Lucius Robinson. The revolt against Robinson which soon took place,\r\ncleared the moral atmosphere wonderfully, and proved that the spirit of\r\nmanhood which De Witt Clinton half a century earlier infused into the\r\npolitics of New York, when he rebelled against a similar tyranny, was\r\nstill to be relied upon in an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe rise of political Abolitionism presents a curious study, and this\r\nrapid outline of its genesis has been deemed necessary. Mr. Kelly at\r\nthe juncture now reached was in a position to take an important and\r\nconservative part in the great anti-slavery controversy, about which so\r\nmany angry passions have been lashed, and whose true history has not\r\nyet been written. The Democratic party of the State of New York has\r\nalways been a quarrelsome family. De Witt Clinton and Van Buren were\r\nleaders of rival factions; Wright and Marcy renewed the controversy;\r\nand Tilden and Kelly, in the present generation, inherited the local\r\nfeuds and marshalled the contending hosts of their party in the State.\r\nSettled first by the Dutch, New York was more rapidly colonized by\r\nthe Puritans, and later by the Irish and Germans. Contrarieties of\r\nrace sped the growth and power of the Empire State, but produced those\r\nantagonisms among its people, which have been more intense there than\r\nin any other State in the Union. Clinton, sprung from Irish stock,\r\nwas at war with Van Buren, who, although of Dutch blood, became the\r\nleader of the New York Puritans. In the days of Jackson and Calhoun the\r\nquarrel was revived over the disputes in which those two celebrated\r\nnational leaders, theretofore devoted friends, were embroiled by\r\nMartin Van Buren about the year 1830. Calhoun was supplanted in\r\nJackson’s affections, and Van Buren, thanks to Peggie O’Neil, succeeded\r\nto the Presidency. But Calhoun’s retributive blows in 1840 and 1844\r\nprostrated Van Buren, and destroyed his ascendency in the Democratic\r\nparty. Stripped of dear bought power, Van Buren resolved on revenge,\r\nand in 1848 turned on the National Democratic party itself, of which\r\nMr. Calhoun was then the powerful leader. Persons of a retrospective\r\nimagination may indulge in day dreams over what might have been the\r\ndestiny of the United States, and over what other and happier story the\r\nMuse of History might have related, had Martin Van Buren restrained his\r\nfeelings, and not rushed headlong into the camp of the Abolitionists.\r\nPursuing the same pleasing train of reflection, they might say—if the\r\nVan Buren bolt had not occurred, the supreme calamity of disunion\r\nand war, which Henry Clay and Daniel Webster by the most marvellous\r\nexercise of statesmanship averted in 1850, might not have taken place\r\nin 1860. But this is all idle speculation, like the saying that if\r\nRichard Cromwell had possessed the genius of his father, he would have\r\nfixed the Protectorate in his family, which Count Joseph de Maistre\r\nbrushes away with the pithy remark, that “this is precisely the same as\r\nto declare, if the Cromwell family had not ceased to rule it would rule\r\nstill.”[14]\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly was trained in the school of William L. Marcy, who, in\r\nconsideration of his pre-eminent abilities, was chosen Secretary\r\nof State by General Pierce, and as the New Hampshire organ of the\r\nPresident, the Concord _Patriot_ declared, because Mr. Marcy had\r\n“completely succeeded in re-uniting the Democracy of New York.” Mr.\r\nKelly occupied a similar position to that taken by Horatio Seymour\r\nin relation to African slavery. Regarding slavery as an evil, Kelly\r\nbelieved, if the principles of Jefferson should be allowed to work\r\nout their legitimate results without infraction of the compromises of\r\nthe Constitution, that the Southern States themselves in time would\r\nadopt the policy of emancipation. This was the sentiment Washington\r\nand Jefferson[15] had often expressed, and which John Randolph put\r\nin practice by emancipating his four hundred slaves. Charles Fenton\r\nMercer, a Virginia statesman whose zeal for the negro was no less\r\nardent than that of Dr. Channing, the Boston philanthropist, devoted\r\nhis life to the extinction of slavery in Virginia. In 1836 John Letcher\r\nand Charles James Faulkner championed a bill for gradual emancipation\r\nin the Legislature of the same State. The Emancipationists did their\r\nshare in the interest of the black man, long before the Abolitionists\r\nbegan their agitation. In estimating the influence of the two forces\r\nupon the destinies of the negro race, greater sobriety of statement\r\nthan that of partisans will be required for the purposes of history.\r\nWhether the views of Senator Ingalls of Kansas on John Brown are\r\nmore correct than those of Mr. Daniel B. Lucas of West Virginia on\r\nJohn Randolph, or whether the verdict of posterity will pronounce\r\nboth eulogists at fault, it is beyond the power of any man of this\r\ngeneration satisfactorily to decide. “Scholars,” Ingalls says,\r\n“orators, poets, philanthropists play their parts, but the crisis comes\r\nthrough some one whom the world regards as a fanatic or impostor, and\r\nwhom the supporters of the system he assails crucify between thieves or\r\ngibbet as a felon. It required generations to arouse the conscience of\r\nthe American people to the enormous iniquity of African slavery. The\r\nclassical orators, the scholarly declaimers and essayists performed\r\ntheir work. They furnished the formulas for popular use and expression,\r\nbut old John Brown, with his pikes, did more in one brief hour to\r\nrender slavery impossible than all the speechmakers and soothsayers had\r\ndone in a quarter of a century, and he will be remembered when they and\r\ntheir works are lost in dusty oblivion.”[16]\r\n\r\n“In regard to African slavery,” Lucas says, “which has played\r\nso important a part in our political history, Randolph was an\r\nEmancipationist as distinguished from an Abolitionist. This distinction\r\nwas a very broad one; as broad as that between Algernon Sidney and\r\nJack Cade. It was the difference between Reason and Fanaticism. On\r\nthis subject Randolph and Clay concurred; both were Emancipationists,\r\nand both denounced the Abolitionists, as did also Webster and all\r\nthe best, wisest and purest men of that day. Randolph was right in\r\nhis denunciation of the Abolitionists. They were a pestilent class\r\nof agitators who, for the most part, with little or no stake in the\r\ncommunity, mounted their hobby-horses, Hatred and Fanaticism, and\r\nrode them, like Ruin and Darkness, the steeds of Lucifer in Bailey’s\r\n“Festus,” over the fairest portion of our Republic. An exhaustless\r\nempire of land has enabled the nation to survive this substitution of\r\nthe methods of Abolition for those of Emancipation; but the eternal\r\ntruth remains the same, that the one was legitimate and the other\r\ninternecine; and to justify the Abolitionists, because Emancipation\r\nfollowed their efforts would be to justify the crime of the Crucifixion\r\nbecause Redemption followed the Cross.”[17]\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party in New York, after the Buffalo Convention, became\r\ndivided upon the subject of slavery, and the Wilmot Proviso tended to\r\nwiden the breach. Barnburners who trained under Van Buren, and Hunkers\r\nwho followed the lead of Marcy, although all claimed to be Democrats,\r\nwere more bitter against each other than against those of the opposite\r\nparty. The election of Franklin Pierce in 1852, upon a platform which\r\nproclaimed the inviolability of the Compromise Measures of 1850, served\r\nto soften the asperities existing in the Democratic party of New York.\r\nBefore that time, Marcy and Seymour, both Hunkers, had declared “that\r\nopinions upon slavery should not be made a test” of party loyalty.\r\nDaniel S. Dickinson, then a Democratic extremist, who afterwards became\r\na Republican extremist, took opposite ground, and refused to unite with\r\nthe Barnburners. This led to the division of the New York Democracy\r\ninto “Hards” and “Softs.” And it is here, after these divisions had\r\ntaken shape, that John Kelly came forward, and acted an interesting and\r\nconspicuous part in this great sectional controversy. His action and\r\ninfluence in the Soft Shell Conventions of August 29, 1855, and January\r\n10, 1856, although he was not a delegate to the latter Convention,\r\nproved him to be a statesman of commanding abilities.\r\n\r\nThe New York Soft Shell Democratic Convention of 1855 was composed of\r\ngentlemen who represented three distinct factions in the Democratic\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nFirst, of those who had not recanted their Free-soil sentiments of\r\n1848, and were still simon-pure Barnburners, utterly opposed to any\r\ncompromise with slaveholders, or the admission of another State\r\ninto the Union with the institution of slavery recognized in its\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nSecondly, of those who had previously occupied the same ground as\r\nthe first class, but who now enjoyed the patronage and favor of the\r\nPierce administration in New York, and who had abandoned their Buffalo\r\nplatform, and accepted the principles of the Missouri Compromise of\r\n1820, prohibiting slavery in all territories, except Missouri, lying\r\nnorth of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude.\r\n\r\nThirdly, of those who accepted the Webster-Clay Compromise of 1850 as a\r\nsettlement “in principle and in substance” of the slavery question in\r\nall the territories, and who, therefore, acquiesced in the legislation\r\nof 1854 in re-affirmation of that memorable compromise.\r\n\r\nThe Union had been saved by the Compromise of 1850. Franklin Pierce\r\nhad been elected on a platform squarely endorsing it. The Whigs had\r\nnot given to it as hearty an endorsement in their platform, but rather\r\nevaded the issue. Pierce went to the people on this vital question,\r\nand beat Scott overwhelmingly. The verdict approached unanimity, only\r\nfour States in the Union giving their electoral votes for Scott. The\r\nCongressional legislation of 1854, known as the Kansas-Nebraska bill,\r\nwas supplementary to, and in strict conformity with the principles\r\nof the Compromise of 1850, and left the question of slavery in those\r\nterritories entirely to the people thereof to settle for themselves,\r\nwith no interference from without. This was the ground taken by Henry\r\nClay in his last great effort to pacify the sections on a basis just\r\nand honorable to each. It was the ground on which Daniel Webster\r\ntook his stand so patriotically in his celebrated 7th-of-March\r\nspeech in 1850. The only man who maintained the same position in the\r\nNew York Soft Shell Democratic Convention of 1855 was John Kelly,\r\nnotwithstanding the unparalleled approval the compromise received\r\nat the hands of the people in Pierce’s election. John Van Buren,\r\nwho had been in company with President Pierce at the White Sulphur\r\nSprings in Virginia—an administration favorite of anti-administration\r\nproclivities—hastened back to New York, and appeared as a delegate at\r\nSyracuse, to defend, as it was reasonably supposed, the measures of\r\nPierce in a convention composed of Democrats who enjoyed the patronage\r\nof the administration. But Prince John, as Mr. Van Buren was called,\r\ndisplayed his usual fickleness in this business, and went far in his\r\ndalliance with the Abolitionists, to undermine the administration in\r\nwhose sunshine he was basking, and to render the renomination of that\r\nexcellent President, Franklin Pierce, practically hopeless. Without\r\nexactly joining the Abolitionists of the Syracuse Convention in an\r\nunqualified crusade against slavery, he kicked over the traces of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill, repudiated the compromise of 1850, and in order\r\nto find a middle ground to stand on went back to the obsolete Missouri\r\nCompromise of 1820. Dean Richmond, Sandford E. Church, and others\r\nfollowed Van Buren’s lead in this matter, and voted for a resolution he\r\nsubmitted taking this position. The Abolitionists of the Convention,\r\nlike General James W. Nye and Ward Hunt, pronounced the Van Buren\r\nresolution “mere patchwork,” and wanted to go further in condemnation\r\nof Franklin Pierce. There was only one man in the convention who stood\r\nup to rebuke the slippery conduct of Mr. Van Buren, and to defend\r\nthe National Democracy from its false friends. This gentleman was\r\nCongressman John Kelly, the subject of this memoir.\r\n\r\nProminent among the delegates who took part in the Convention were\r\nDean Richmond, chairman of the Democratic State Committee; Sandford\r\nE. Church, afterwards Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals;\r\nJohn Kelly, Congressman elect; John Cochrane, Surveyor of the Port of\r\nNew York; Lorenzo B. Shepard, John Van Buren, Robert Kelly, President\r\nof the Convention; James W. Nye, Timothy Jenkins, Wm. Cassidy, Ward\r\nHunt, Andrew H. Green, Israel T. Hatch, who was nominated for Governor,\r\nThomas B. Alvord, Peter Cagger, Dennis McCarthy and Benjamin Wood.\r\nAlthough the Convention was called to nominate candidates for State\r\nofficers, the debate took a wide range, and the Kansas-Nebraska\r\ntroubles became the subject of an angry discussion.\r\n\r\nThe New York _Herald_ of September 2, 1855, contained in its Syracuse\r\ncorrespondence a spirited sketch of the brilliant debate in the\r\nConvention, and of the exciting scenes to which it gave rise. A\r\ndisruption at one time seemed inevitable. “The excitement,” said the\r\n_Herald_, “had been wrought up to fever heat. There were dire menacings\r\nof a bolt. Both divisions of the army seemed ready simultaneously to\r\nthrow off their allegiance, and go over to the double enemy. Mr. John\r\nKelly of New York, had thrown out awful menacings of defection in favor\r\nof the National Democracy, if the Convention should fail to endorse the\r\nadministration; and Ex-Lieutenant Governor Church, Jenkins and Hunt, of\r\nOneida, and the good-humored member from Suffolk, General Nye, seemed\r\nto be just as ready to march off with their hosts to the Republican\r\nparty. The remnant of the faction, if any were left, might have divided\r\nthemselves among the Whigs or Know-Nothings, leaving only the Custom\r\nHouse, marshalled by John Cochrane, as the sole corporal’s guard of\r\nthe Administration. Such a dreadful contingency was to be avoided at\r\nall hazards and sacrifices. The recess was utilized in endeavoring\r\nto harmonize conflicting views, and to beat down the extravagant\r\nrequirements of the extremists of either section. There was, therefore,\r\nintense interest manifested in the proceedings of the evening session,\r\nand when the Convention re-assembled at 7 o’clock P. M., the hall was\r\ncrowded to its greatest capacity.”\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary stages of the Convention two sets of resolutions\r\nhad been submitted. Those of the regularly appointed committee were\r\nreported by William Cassidy. In these the Pierce administration\r\nwas endorsed, and the National Democracy sustained. Minority or\r\nsupplementary resolutions taking directly opposite grounds were offered\r\nby Timothy Jenkins, a pronounced Free-soiler.\r\n\r\nJenkins, in a radical Barnburner speech, denounced the territorial\r\nlegislation known as the Kansas-Nebraska bill, arraigned the President,\r\nand demanded a restoration of the Missouri Compromise. He was answered\r\nby John Cochrane in defence of the President, but as Mr. Cochrane had\r\nbeen a violent Barnburner in 1848, his argument was handicapped by\r\nhis record. Besides, he was Surveyor of the Port of New York, and the\r\nnewspapers had often referred to a letter said to have been written\r\nby Franklin Pierce to the bolting Barnburners’ meeting in the Park\r\nin 1848, at which the standards of party rebellion against Cass\r\nand Butler and the National Democracy were first raised. If General\r\nPierce wrote such a letter it was suppressed, but Mr. Cochrane’s\r\nopponents claimed that he was the recipient of this “scarlet letter,”\r\nas the _Herald_ styled it, and as he subsequently obtained one of the\r\nPresident’s fat offices, uncharitable comments were made upon General\r\nPierce’s motives in the transaction. But it is scarcely credible, in\r\nview of Pierce’s antecedents, that he could have committed himself to\r\nthe Van Buren bolters of 1848. His record in the United States Senate,\r\nand in New Hampshire, had been that of a Jeffersonian Democrat of the\r\nstrict construction school.\r\n\r\nJohn Van Buren addressed the Convention after Mr. Cochrane, but as\r\nhe too had been a Barnburner, and the Rupert of debate among the\r\nbolters of 1848, his effort now to throw oil on the troubled waters\r\nproved a failure. Besides, it was a very halting effort. He moved that\r\nall resolutions in relation to the Administration, Kansas-Nebraska\r\nlegislation, and Slavery be laid on the table, but did not press the\r\nmotion to a vote, and shortly after withdrew it. The motion to withdraw\r\nwas more consonant with Mr. Van Buren’s real sentiments than the one\r\nto table the disturbing resolutions. The Convention was now face to\r\nface with Mr. Jenkins’s anti-Democratic programme, and Mr. Van Buren\r\nshowed a disposition to support it. It was at this juncture that Mr.\r\nJohn Kelly rose to stem the tide of Sewardism that was sweeping over\r\nthe Convention. With an intuitive understanding of a scene which was\r\nconstantly shifting, but whose inevitable end, if not now stopped,\r\nhe foresaw would be the elevation of William H. Seward to a position\r\nlittle short of that of dictator of the destinies of the Union, John\r\nKelly pointed out the perilous levity of Mr. Van Buren’s conduct, and\r\nmade a patriotic appeal to the Convention to close up its ranks and\r\nredeem the State from Know-Nothingism, and the sectional Republican\r\nparty. “The firebrand of discord,” said Mr. Kelly, “which gentlemen\r\nof the old Barnburner persuasion are now on this floor throwing into\r\nthe ranks of the Democratic party, would have even worse consequences\r\nthan their course had produced in 1848, when they defeated General\r\nCass for the Presidency, and enabled the Whigs to slip into control\r\nof the Legislature, and elect Mr. Seward United States Senator to\r\nsucceed a Democrat. The fate of the Union now trembled in the balance,\r\nand dissensions in this Convention would go far to destroy the\r\nNational Democracy, and place the sceptre of power in the hands of\r\nthe arch-agitator, William H. Seward. Mr. Van Buren’s constituents,”\r\ncontinued Mr. Kelly, “will approve of the resolutions of the Committee\r\nin favor of the National Democracy, though that gentleman may not do\r\nso. I admire Mr. Van Buren’s personal character, but not his political\r\ntergiversations. I hope the Convention will sustain the administration\r\nof Franklin Pierce, and not divide the Democratic party by passing the\r\nsupplementary resolutions of the gentleman from Oneida. But to preserve\r\nharmony here I am willing to leave out all matters relating to Kansas,\r\nand so will be the delegation from New York city, who are prepared now\r\nto vote for the resolutions of the regular committee.”[18]\r\n\r\nGeneral Nye, former political associate of Gerrit Smith, the John Brown\r\nAbolitionist, took the floor to reply to Mr. Kelly. Bowie knives, and\r\npistols, and pronunciamentos in Kansas formed the burden of his speech.\r\nIn conclusion the eloquent but somewhat comical General Nye declared:\r\n“I would say, President Pierce, you have openly insulted the spirit\r\nof your countrymen. Let us speak out and make this declaration. I\r\nknow it is our opinion, and think it is his. I don’t think my friend\r\nKelly would withdraw from the Convention if we passed the Jenkins\r\nresolutions; but if he should do so, we should obtain legions by\r\nadopting them. The Republican Convention is counting on our ominous\r\nsilence.”\r\n\r\nAnother Free Soil resolution was introduced at this point by Sandford\r\nE. Church, declaring uncompromising hostility to the extension of\r\nslavery into free territory. John Van Buren again took the floor and\r\nloudly advocated the Church resolution. An administration resolution\r\nwas next offered by Lorenzo B. Shepard, declaring that the people in\r\nthe Territory of Kansas should be left to settle their own matters\r\nas to slavery without interference from the North or South. A Mr.\r\nHinckley, of Ontario County, made a violent Abolition speech, and\r\ncaused roars of laughter by assuming a tragic attitude and declaring,\r\n“I feel like a brave Indian on the battle field.”\r\n\r\nJohn Van Buren, whose mission in the Convention seemed to be to destroy\r\nhis friend President Pierce, now offered the following resolution:\r\n\r\n “_Resolved_, That while the Democracy of this State will faithfully\r\n adhere to all the compromises of the Constitution, and maintain all\r\n the reserved rights of the States, they deem this an appropriate\r\n occasion to declare their fixed hostility to the extension of slavery\r\n into free territory.”[19]\r\n\r\nHe supported this resolution in a long speech, in which he tried hard\r\nto leave the Administration without a leg to stand on. As a death-blow\r\nto Pierce, the effort was eminently successful. In conclusion, he moved\r\nto lay the whole subject on the table. Having shot his parthian arrow\r\ninto the side of the National Democracy, Prince John was not disposed\r\nto give its friends a chance to be heard. A sharp running debate now\r\ntook place between Mr. Kelly and Mr. Van Buren. The New York _Herald_\r\npublished a synopsis of it:\r\n\r\n“Mr. John Kelly, of New York, hoped the gentleman would not press his\r\nmotion, but would give other gentlemen an opportunity of expressing\r\ntheir sentiments.”\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren: “I will withdraw it, for I am going to dinner\r\n(laughter), provided you or the gentleman who shall speak last agrees\r\nto renew it in my name.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I will agree to that if the Convention agrees to go to\r\ndinner now.” (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren: “But if the Convention does not now take a recess, I\r\nwant to make the same bargain. I want the last man who speaks to renew\r\nthe motion in my name.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I will do no such thing.”\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren: “Then I insist on my motion.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I expected more generosity from the gentleman from the\r\nThirteenth District of New York, than to do anything of this kind.”\r\n\r\nAt this point a recess was taken until 3 o’clock P. M. On the\r\nre-assembling of the body Mr. John Kelly addressed the Convention,\r\nand showed a determination not to be choked off by Mr. John Van Buren\r\nand the Seward contingent of Disunionists and Abolitionists, who,\r\nnotwithstanding their noisy demonstrations, constituted only about\r\none-third of the Convention. He made a powerful speech in defense of\r\nthe National Democracy, and the Administration of General Pierce. He\r\nreviewed, in scathing terms, the treason to Cass and Butler on the\r\npart of the bolting Barnburners in 1848, and when he declared sternly\r\nand with unmistakable indignation, that, if this treason was now to\r\nbe repeated he would leave the Convention, and never again affiliate\r\nwith Barnburners, a great sensation occurred, and it became evident\r\nthat the schemes of the fanatics had been arrested and thwarted by\r\nMr. Kelly. A hurried consultation took place between the friends and\r\nopponents of the Administration. Mr. Kelly’s demand that a delegation\r\nof true Democrats, and not Seward Democrats, should be sent to the\r\nCincinnati National Convention, and that a platform endorsing the\r\nterritorial legislation of Congress in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska bill\r\n(in effect a re-affirmation of the Webster-Clay Compromise of 1850)\r\nshould be adopted, was reluctantly but finally conceded. The sectional\r\nand disturbing resolutions of Jenkins, Church and Hunt were withdrawn,\r\nand in return for these concessions it was agreed to by Kelly and his\r\nfriends that the appointment of the delegation to Cincinnati should\r\nbe postponed to a later day, and the drafting of an address and\r\nresolutions expressive of National Democratic principles should be\r\ndeferred until the meeting of another convention, at which the National\r\nConvention delegates should be chosen. In view of this compromise any\r\nfurther conflict over the Van Buren Free-soil resolution was avoided,\r\nand it was adopted by the Convention.\r\n\r\nNo full report of Mr. Kelly’s important speech, which brought about the\r\nadministration victory, was taken down at the time of its delivery,\r\nindeed none of the speeches before the convention was fully reported.\r\nThe New York _Herald_, of September 1st, 1855, contained the following\r\nsynopsis of what he said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. John Kelly, of New York, took the floor. He came here, he\r\nsaid, to represent the Democracy of the city of New York, and he\r\nwas determined to do so. He was always led to suppose that it was\r\nnot upon principle, but upon personal grounds that the Democratic\r\nparty was divided. He belonged to the Tammany Hall section of the\r\nparty, but if it were resolved to force down the throats of the\r\nConvention resolutions derogatory to the honor of the Democratic\r\nparty, and of the administration, he, for one, would not remain in\r\nthe Convention. Let these dividing questions, he said, rest as they\r\nare. If the resolutions reported by the Committee were brought up,\r\nthe city delegates would sustain them. But if on the other hand, the\r\nresolutions of the gentleman from Oneida were forced down the throats\r\nof the body, he would leave the Convention, and never attach himself\r\nagain to this branch of the party. (Sensation and applause.) He\r\nasked was it desirable for one-third of this Convention to be the\r\nmeans of severing the ties which connect the party together? He knew\r\nthat the constituents of the gentleman from New York who last spoke\r\n(Mr. Van Buren) would endorse the administration, and endorse the\r\nKansas-Nebraska bill. If it were the desire of that gentleman to try\r\nand distract the Convention, he should have come from another district,\r\nand not disgrace that which sent him. (Hisses and applause.) When\r\nhe—Mr. Kelly—remembered the causes of the division of the Democracy\r\nin 1848, he thought that the ‘isms’ and those causes of division\r\nwere to be forever buried in oblivion. But they come here again.\r\nShall it be said that the Democratic party of New York shall not\r\nsustain a Democratic administration? If so, let it go forth that the\r\nadministration portion of the Democratic party of New York has refused\r\nto endorse and sustain it. He trusted the Convention would consider\r\nthese matters well, and see what they were going to do. They were going\r\nto divide the party and dissever it, never to be brought together\r\nagain in its present strength. They were going to give the power to\r\nthe proscriptive Know-Nothing party, which would bring the country to\r\nruin and desolation. Let them consider the matter well, and ask their\r\nconsciences whether they could do such a thing as this. He, for one,\r\nwould vote for the resolutions endorsing the administration, and if it\r\nwere necessary to endorse the Kansas and Nebraska bill, he would vote\r\nfor such resolution, too, and he was sure that the majority of the New\r\nYork delegation would do so.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Nye: “It is not on the issue of the Kansas-Nebraska bill that\r\nthe Democratic party of New York can hope to triumph, nor on it that\r\nmy friend from New York city, Mr. John Kelly, can expect to be sent to\r\nCongress in 1856.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “On that issue alone I was elected.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Nye: “It so happens, however, that the opposing candidate voted\r\nfor the bill, and you could not have much advantage over him there.\r\n(Laughter.) Besides, the very district which my friend Mr. Van Buren\r\nis said to misrepresent—the Thirteenth—elected John Wheeler, who voted\r\nagainst the bill.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Will you also state that John Wheeler was elected by the\r\nKnow-Nothing party?”\r\n\r\nGeneral Nye: “No: I know nothing of that party. (Laughter.) I wish\r\nthis Convention to treat the subject in a manly way. If you do, I do\r\nnot believe Mr. Kelly will withdraw from the Convention; but even if\r\nhe does, better he should go than that the hosts that I see around me\r\nshould do so.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ward Hunt, of Oneida, made a violent Free soil speech, in the\r\ncourse of which he said:\r\n\r\n“Another gentleman from the city of New York, a member of Congress\r\nelect (Mr. John Kelly), threatened to walk out of the Convention, if\r\nit happened to adopt a course not in accordance with his views. He\r\nwould only say that if that gentleman did walk out, his blessing would\r\ngo with him, and the delegation of the city of New York might go with\r\nhim, too.”\r\n\r\nMr. O’Keefe: “Except Van Buren.” (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt: “Well, I am glad to see that there is one good man left in\r\nthe city of New York.”\r\n\r\nMr. Van Buren: “I will not give notice, like my friend from the\r\nFourteenth Ward, Mr. Kelly, that if the procedure of the Convention\r\nshould not please me I would bolt. Perhaps if I did, the Convention on\r\nthat very account would persist in adopting such measures.” (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nThe repeated references by the leading opposition members of the\r\nConvention to Mr. Kelly’s notice of his determination to retire, if\r\nthe Seward wing of the party persisted in its factious course, and the\r\nconcessions which followed, showed that the blow had been sent home.\r\nThe one strong man had been found to arrest the progress of disunion,\r\nand to aid materially in staving off in 1856, the calamity which\r\nfinally overtook the country in 1860.\r\n\r\nHad New York entered the Democratic National Convention of 1856,\r\ndistracted by intestine feuds, as was the case in 1848, the election of\r\nthe Republican candidate for President, John C. Fremont, probably would\r\nhave followed, together with the dreadful appeal to arms which shook\r\nthe continent four years later. The State ticket placed in the field by\r\nthe Soft Shell Convention of 1855, was not successful at the polls. The\r\nState was carried by the Know-Nothings by decisive majorities. Samuel\r\nJ. Tilden was the candidate on the Soft Shell ticket of that year for\r\nAttorney General. A short time before the election Mr. Tilden received\r\nthe following letter from Josiah Sutherland, nominee for the same\r\noffice on the State ticket of the other wing of the party:\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK CITY, Friday, Oct. 12, 1855.\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL J. TILDEN, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n MY DEAR SIR:—I was nominated for the office of Attorney General of\r\n this State, by that portion of the Democratic party of the State\r\n called the Hards; you were subsequently nominated for the same office\r\n by that portion or section of the Democratic party of the State called\r\n the Softs. I look upon the resolutions passed and published by the\r\n Convention which put me in nomination (a copy of which I herewith\r\n enclose) as truly, emphatically and unequivocally expressing great\r\n principles of the National Democracy and of the Constitution. The\r\n third resolution, as you will observe, firmly enunciates the great\r\n Democratic principle, “That it should be left to the people of the\r\n States to determine for themselves all local questions, including the\r\n subject of slavery;” it expresses also “an unqualified adherence to\r\n the Kansas-Nebraska Bill,” and a firm opposition to “any effort to\r\n re-establish the Missouri prohibition.”\r\n\r\n I approve of these resolutions and have endorsed them, and do\r\n now endorse them in letter and spirit. Do you look upon these\r\n resolutions as truly and faithfully expressing principles of the\r\n National Democracy and of the Constitution? Are you in favor of the\r\n Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and of the great principle of the exclusive\r\n constitutional right and liberty of the people of the Territories on\r\n the subject of slavery, thereby affirmed?\r\n\r\n Do you believe that in the organization of future Territories Congress\r\n will have no right or power, under the Constitution as it now is,\r\n to prevent the inception, existence or continuance of slavery in\r\n such Territories as a domestic or Territorial institution; that\r\n the question and subject of slavery as a domestic or Territorial\r\n institution, in the absence of any express provision or clause of the\r\n Constitution giving such right and power to Congress, will and must\r\n of necessity belong exclusively to the people of such Territories—of\r\n natural, if not of constitutional right; and that the only\r\n constitutional and legitimate way in which a citizen of Massachusetts\r\n or of New York can interfere with or act upon that question, is by\r\n exercising his undoubted right to move to the territory where the\r\n question is pending, and to become a citizen or resident thereof?\r\n\r\n Are you opposed to the political, verbal “Black Republican” fanatics\r\n and demagogues of the North, who, using words for things, oppose\r\n this great principle, and call for a restoration of the “Missouri\r\n Compromise line?” Are you opposed to the State ticket lately put in\r\n nomination in this State, headed by Preston King, and to the declared\r\n principles and grounds upon which that ticket was nominated?\r\n\r\n The opinions, propositions, or principles which would be implied in\r\n the affirmative answers to the foregoing questions appear to me to\r\n be plainly expressed, or necessarily implied in the resolutions of\r\n the Convention which put me in nomination, and of which you herewith\r\n receive a copy.\r\n\r\n Please answer these questions by letter at the earliest possible\r\n day; for if you answer them in the affirmative, I shall take great\r\n pleasure in immediately laying your letter before the State Committee\r\n of the party which put me in nomination, and shall at the same time\r\n inform that Committee that I decline any longer to be considered a\r\n candidate. I will not stand in the way of a union of the Democratic\r\n party of this State upon principle. The Constitution and the Union now\r\n need the united force of the Democratic party of this State for their\r\n protection.\r\n\r\n With the most sincere desire to promote such a union of that party,\r\n and with high regard for yourself personally, I have the honor to be,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  JOSIAH SUTHERLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. TILDEN’S REPLY.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK, Thursday, Oct. 18, 1855.\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR:—I have received your letter, offering, on certain\r\n conditions, to send your declension to the State Committee of the\r\n party by which you were nominated, with my letter of compliance, and\r\n to open to me the opportunity of running before that Committee for\r\n their nomination in the vacancy.\r\n\r\n I think that, on reflection, you will see that it is impossible for\r\n me to entertain any negotiation, or discuss any conditions, for a\r\n fusion of a part of the two State tickets, as proposed by you, or of\r\n the entire ticket, as proposed in other quarters. Still less can I\r\n initiate such an arrangement for my individual advantage, irrespective\r\n of the other gentlemen nominated on the ticket with me, and which,\r\n even if not intended for that purpose, may result in a call for\r\n some of them to reciprocate your withdrawal. Discussions as to the\r\n feasibility, propriety or terms of any union of the two tickets belong\r\n not to me, but to the party which nominated me, or its authorized\r\n representatives. The only countenance I could, in any event, give to\r\n the suggestion would be in retiring myself, and not in being made\r\n instrumental in, or even a party to, causing others to do so. Those\r\n who have done me the honor to make me their candidate know that no\r\n delicacy toward me need restrain them from anything of this nature\r\n which they think it advisable to do. Very respectfully, your obedient\r\n servant,\r\n\r\n  HON. J. SUTHERLAND.[20]       S. J. TILDEN.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Mr. Tilden made no answer to Judge\r\nSutherland’s inquiries on the vexed question of slavery in the\r\nterritories. Mr. Tilden was one of the Free soil bolters at the\r\nBaltimore Convention of 1848, and supported Van Buren and Adams in the\r\nPresidential contest of that year. His views on the subject of Slavery\r\nin the Territories, which he did not disclose in this correspondence,\r\nwere frankly stated five years later in his letter of October 26, 1860,\r\nto Judge William Kent. “I never held any opinion,” said Mr. Tilden\r\nin the Kent letter, “which could justify either the policy or the\r\norganization of the Republican party. If I had done so I should not\r\nhesitate to frankly renounce so grave an error. * * * But, in truth,\r\nI never adopted the doctrine of absolute and universal exclusion,\r\nby federal legislation, of slavery from all territories, and still\r\nless that of the exclusion of new slave States, or the philosophical\r\ntheories on which the doctrines are founded.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s energetic protests in the Soft Shell Convention of 1855\r\nbore ample fruit in the Convention of the same party held at Syracuse\r\nJanuary 10, 1856. The delegates chosen to represent the Softs at\r\nCincinnati were headed by Horatio Seymour, and were National Democrats\r\nof conservative convictions and feelings. Mr. Kelly was a delegate\r\nfrom the Fourth Congressional District. An able and elaborate address,\r\nwritten by Nicholas Hill, Jr., was adopted by the Convention, and\r\nwas replete with sound Democratic doctrine of the broadest national\r\ncharacter. Not a word of Free soilism appeared in it. The resolutions\r\nwere of the same conservative kind, and adverted to the triumph of\r\nthe principles of the Kansas-Nebraska bill as shown in the recent\r\nelections. The fourth resolution was in these words:\r\n\r\n “_Resolved_, That the determination of Congress, avowed in the\r\n Kansas-Nebraska bill, to reject from the National councils the subject\r\n of slavery in the Territories, and to leave the people thereof free to\r\n regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\n the Constitution of the United States, is one that accords with the\r\n sentiments of the Democracy of this State, and with the traditional\r\n course of legislation by Congress, which under Democratic auspices,\r\n has gradually, in successive Territorial bills, extended the domain\r\n of popular right and limited the range of Congressional action;\r\n and that we believe this disposition of the question will result\r\n most auspiciously to the peace of the Union and the cause of good\r\n government.”\r\n\r\nThus the principles advocated by John Kelly were embodied in the\r\naddress and resolutions of this Convention, while those which John Van\r\nBuren had urged were entirely rejected. Franklin Pierce was unfortunate\r\nin the selection of his political representative in the State of New\r\nYork, at this important juncture. He was an aspirant for renomination,\r\nand his brilliant but unstable counsellor, Prince John, landed him\r\nin a Serbonion bog, and left the coveted prize to James Buchanan.\r\nJohn Kelly would have proved a safer adviser for the eloquent and\r\npatriotic Pierce. The differences between the two wings of the New York\r\nDemocracy, led respectively by Horatio Seymour and Greene C. Bronson,\r\nwere harmonized at Cincinnati, and on motion of Mr. Bayard of Delaware,\r\nboth were admitted on an equal footing in the National Convention.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that William L. Marcy desired John Kelly, in place of\r\nJohn Van Buren, to be made the mouthpiece of the Administration in New\r\nYork at this critical period. But from the day of Pierce’s election\r\nJohn Van Buren had been assiduous in his attentions to him. He went\r\nearly to Concord before the inauguration, and was closeted with the\r\nPresident elect.[21] He was with him at the White Sulphur Springs, in\r\nVirginia, just before the Syracuse Convention of 1855. Mr. Van Buren\r\nwas a man of varied and fascinating accomplishments, and found it\r\nan easy task to capture the President’s heart. Notwithstanding the\r\npreference of Mr. Marcy for John Kelly as administration leader in\r\nNew York, on Prince John was bestowed that distinction. William L.\r\nMarcy, with the exception of De Witt Clinton, the greatest Democratic\r\nstatesman the Empire State has yet furnished to the country, died at\r\nBallston Spa, New York, July, 4, 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly won a national reputation by his brilliant course in the\r\nSyracuse Convention of 1855. His services in the cause of the Democracy\r\nwere recognized on all sides before he took his seat in Congress at\r\nthe meeting in December of that year. General Cass, successor of\r\nMr. Marcy in the State Department, introduced and welcomed his old\r\nNew York supporter of 1848 into the councils and friendship of the\r\nAdministration of Mr. Buchanan. John Kelly entered the field of Federal\r\npolitics, as a member of the Thirty-fourth Congress, under favorable\r\nauspices for a successful career.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Ingersoll’s Hist.

GIDDINGS PLAYS PART\r\n OF CASSANDRA—CULLEN OF DELAWARE TALKS OF EGGING THE CATHOLICS—KELLY\r\n REPLIES—READS IMPORTANT LETTER OF LAFAYETTE ON PRIESTS WHICH THE\r\n KNOW-NOTHINGS HAD GARBLED—KELLY THE ONLY CATHOLIC IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough a political rather than a chronological order has been\r\nobserved in the preceding chapters, it is necessary now, for the\r\npreservation of important threads of the narrative, to speak of some\r\nevents as they transpired.\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly, then captain of that popular company the Emmet Guards, was\r\nelected Alderman for the Fourteenth Ward at the election in November,\r\n1853, to serve for two years, beginning January 1st, 1854. Twenty-five\r\nor thirty years ago the people of the city of New York selected the\r\nstrongest men in the community to represent them in the Board of\r\nAldermen. To attain, at that period, the place of a City Father was an\r\nobject of ambition with those who sought an attractive rank among their\r\nfellow-citizens, and many men were elected Aldermen who have since\r\nbecome famous in State and National politics. The Boards of which\r\nMr. Kelly was a member in 1854-5, were exceptionally able bodies. At\r\nhis election, November 8th, 1853, the whole number of votes cast for\r\nAlderman of the Fourteenth Ward was 1938, of which John Kelly received\r\n1097; Thomas Wheelan, 566; and Morris Miller, 275. Mr. Kelly’s majority\r\nover all was 256. He was a member of the Committee on the Almshouse\r\nDepartment in the Board of Aldermen, and of the Committee on Annual\r\nTaxes in the Board of Supervisors, the latter body being composed of\r\nthe Mayor, Recorder and Board of Aldermen. The Aldermanic list for\r\n1854 contains the well-known names of Nathan C. Ely, President of the\r\nPeter Cooper Insurance Company, and also President of the Board of\r\nAldermen; William Boardman, jun.; Abram Wakeman, Amor J. Williamson,\r\nThomas Christy, Anson Herrick, Daniel D. Lord, John Kelly, Richard Mott\r\nand Thomas Woodward. To these were added, in 1855, Isaac O. Barker,\r\nwho succeeded Mr. Ely as President of the Board, Orison Blunt, William\r\nChauncey, George W. Varian, and others, the new members taking the\r\nseats of those whose terms expired in 1854.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s aptitude for affairs was soon recognized by his fellow\r\nmembers. President Barker placed him on no less than five committees in\r\nhis second year in the Board, and appointed him chairman of the most\r\nimportant committee of the body—that on Annual Taxes in the Board of\r\nSupervisors. The members of this Committee were John Kelly, Henry R.\r\nHoffmire and Daniel D. Lord. The Know-Nothings were then powerful in\r\nNew York, and John Kelly was their sleepless opponent in the Board of\r\nAldermen. His constituents were warmly attached to the man, and duly\r\nappreciated his services in official life. Some even went so far as to\r\npredict that he would soon become a dangerous rival to the celebrated\r\nMike Walsh, then in the meridian of his popularity. Kelly and Walsh\r\nboth lived in the Fourth Congressional District, and the latter was at\r\nthat time representing the District with great acceptability in the\r\nThirty-third Congress. The prediction was verified, and Kelly became\r\nWalsh’s competitor at the ensuing election. The interest which this\r\ncontest excited was not confined to the city, but extended to all parts\r\nof the State of New York. The plan adopted in these pages of giving\r\noutline sketches of the more conspicuous men with whose names that of\r\nMr. Kelly has been associated in political controversies, certainly\r\ncannot be disregarded in the case of Mike Walsh, that wayward genius,\r\ngifted orator, and child of misfortune.\r\n\r\nMichael Walsh was born in the town of Bandon, County Cork, Ireland,\r\nin 1815, and came to this country with his parents when he was a\r\nchild. His father was an intelligent, industrious, hard working man,\r\nand the owner of a mahogany yard in Washington Street, New York.\r\nHe entertained peculiar views in regard to a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and on that account never became a citizen of the United\r\nStates. His son Michael possessed a great deal of talent, and was\r\neducated at St. Peter’s school in Barclay Street. When he was about\r\nsixteen years of age his father indentured him to a lithographer at\r\nBroadway and Fulton Street, with whom he learned that business. He was\r\nhardly twenty-one when he began to be exceedingly active in political\r\naffairs in New York, and the whole country. As an orator, for his\r\nage, he had probably no equal. He possessed literary ability, and was\r\nequally ready with pen or tongue. His forte, however, was sarcasm, and\r\nunfortunately for himself he had an unrivaled knack for coining slang\r\nexpressions. Many of the slang sayings peculiar to New York at this\r\nday were invented by Mike Walsh. He was naturally humorous, and was\r\nendowed with powers of mimicry that would have made his fortune on the\r\nstage. He could describe the weaknesses of human nature, and lay bare\r\nthe motives which influenced public men in their actions with a mastery\r\nwhich no other man of his time possessed.\r\n\r\nHe was elected to the lower branch of the Legislature of New York\r\nbefore he was twenty-one years of age, and although he had little or\r\nno business ability, he distinguished himself in the House by his\r\nfine oratorical powers. His speeches were not only interesting and\r\namusing, but often full of information. Without previous thought or\r\nreflection, he could make a capital off-hand speech, expressing his\r\nviews very intelligently, and enlisting the attention of his audience\r\nthroughout. The Democratic party in New York, at that period, was under\r\nthe control and influence of men who had very little respect for Walsh,\r\nas his manners were not only objectionable, but sometimes his language\r\nwas abusive. He was very strong, notwithstanding, with the people,\r\nand on that account was feared by the leaders. He was re-elected to\r\nthe Assembly several times. He established and edited a paper which\r\nhe called “The Subterranean,” and his squibs, sometimes clever but\r\noften coarse, were sent forth in its columns. There was a furniture\r\ndealer in the Fifth Ward named John Horsepool, between whom and Walsh\r\na bitter feud existed. Several times Horsepool had him arrested for\r\nlibel. At last “The Subterranean” belched forth an angrier flame than\r\nusual, and Horsepool got his revenge. Walsh was indicted, tried and\r\nconvicted, and sent for a short term to the penitentiary. But this\r\nserved to excite sympathy for him and increase his popularity. He\r\nwas a very companionable man, was full of anecdote, and had a very\r\nretentive memory. He recollected, without particular effort, nearly\r\neverything he had ever read, and if called upon would recount a story\r\nor any other matter with great precision. Among his companions, for\r\nseveral years, were Tom Hyer, the pugilist, and Jack Haggarty, son of\r\nthe old New York auctioneer of that name. They generally made their\r\nheadquarters at the Hone House, a hostelry kept by Morgan L. Mott. This\r\nwas formerly the private residence of Philip Hone, and took its name\r\nfrom him. Walsh and his coterie would gather together here daily, and\r\nrelate stories and anecdotes of their checkered experiences. Having no\r\nbusiness occupations and some money to spend, they all shortened their\r\ndays by the immoderate use of alcoholic stimulants. As long as Mike\r\nWalsh survived he was the life of the company. During the Presidential\r\ncanvass of 1844 Walsh formed a political organization on the East Side\r\nof New York city, which he named the Spartan Band. This body was in\r\nopposition to the Empire Club of Captain Isaiah Rynders. Both of these\r\nclubs were exceedingly active during the Polk and Dallas campaign,\r\nand rendered efficient service to the Democratic ticket. Walsh was\r\nproud of the influence he wielded over his men, and of the power his\r\nposition brought to him as a leader. The singular notion occurred to\r\nhim of giving high-sounding titles to his several lieutenants, and\r\nhe consequently called them after the distinguished French Marshals\r\nwho fought in the wars of Napoleon the First. All the men who were\r\nprominent in those days in the Spartan Band and Empire Club have long\r\nsince passed away, with the exception of Captain Rynders, who still\r\nfigures in New York politics at eighty-one, as erect of carriage and\r\nalmost as brisk of step as he was fifty years ago.[22]\r\n\r\nA curious anecdote is told of the way in which Mike Walsh and David C.\r\nBroderick, subsequently Senator from California, ceased to be friends.\r\nAfter Walsh was sentenced to Blackwell’s Island, an understanding is\r\nsaid to have been reached between them that Walsh should commit suicide\r\non his way to the penitentiary by jumping from the ferry-boat into the\r\nEast River. Walsh being regarded as the champion of the poor as against\r\nthe rich, and many believing he had been sentenced to Blackwell’s\r\nIsland because of his advocacy of the interests of the poor, his death\r\nin the manner indicated, it was thought, would be avenged by his\r\nfollowers as that of a martyr in their cause. In view of the disgrace\r\nvisited upon him, Walsh is said to have promised Broderick that he\r\nwould sacrifice his life by drowning, and thus stir up the vengeance of\r\nthe populace in retaliation upon his and their oppressors. But Walsh\r\nshowed better sense than to do so foolish a thing, and Broderick became\r\nhis enemy, and branded him as a coward, because he did not kill himself\r\naccording to promise.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months Mike Walsh was in the habit of frequently\r\nsleeping all night in one or another of the parks of the city, because,\r\nas he claimed, the night air hardened his constitution. For the same\r\nreason he seldom wore an overcoat in winter. He was an inveterate\r\njoker, and was in his element whenever he could play a trick on the\r\nunwary or uninitiated. He was the author of the Frank McLoughlin\r\nhoax, which all old New Yorkers will remember. McLoughlin was a noted\r\nsporting man in New York forty years ago, and a great toast among\r\nhorse men, pugilists, and like people of that day. He was one of the\r\nCalifornia pioneers of 1849 when the gold excitement broke out. In a\r\nfew years he returned to New York. Mike Walsh happened to be passing\r\nthrough the City Hall Park, and met McLoughlin as he was on his way\r\nfrom the ship to the house of his relatives.\r\n\r\n“Well, Frank,” said Mike, “I see you have returned.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Do you expect to remain here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said Frank, “I hope to spend the remainder of my days in\r\nNew York. I have been in no place since I left here that I like as\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said Mike, “all of your friends will be glad to see you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am sure they will, and I shall be glad to see them.”\r\n\r\nThus they separated. Walsh hastened over to the Pewter Mug on Frankfort\r\nStreet, Thomas Dunlap proprietor, then known as Tammany Hall. Passing\r\ninto the bar-room, Walsh exclaimed to those present that he had just\r\nseen Frank McLoughlin, and that he had gone to a public-house on\r\nthe Bowery, and requested his friends to call on him there at once.\r\nMcLoughlin being a favorite, a great many persons started out to find\r\nhim, but as it was Sunday they encountered some difficulty in obtaining\r\nadmittance to the hotel. The bar-keeper there perceived the joke in an\r\ninstant, and said McLoughlin had been at the hotel, but had gone to\r\nJohn Teal’s, on the corner of Stanton and Forsyth Streets, having left\r\nword, if any of his friends should call, they were to go there and see\r\nhim. Walsh took care to circulate the hoax all over the city, sending\r\npeople to various points in quest of McLoughlin, who was the bearer,\r\nquoth Mike, of many letters and presents to the boys in New York from\r\nold acquaintances in California. Proprietors of drinking saloons reaped\r\na large harvest by selling extra quantities of their beverages to the\r\nvictims of the hoax. In sportive tricks of this sort Mike Walsh was\r\ncontinually engaged.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 he was nominated for Congress in the Fourth Congressional\r\nDistrict, and elected. He served in the House of Representatives for\r\ntwo years, and attracted by his peculiar powers much attention in that\r\nbody. He was nominated the second time in 1854 by the Hard Shells. The\r\nSoft Shells nominated John Kelly. A very bitter and exciting contest\r\nfollowed. Many thought Walsh was invincible in the Fourth District,\r\nbut his opponent was very popular, and the struggle between them was\r\ncarried on with great enthusiasm and energy. Mr. Kelly came out the\r\nvictor, but only with eighteen plurality. The whole number of votes was\r\n7,593, of which John Kelly received 3,068; Mike Walsh, 3,050; Sandford\r\nE. Macomber, 824; John W. Brice, 626; James Kelly, 1; and scattering,\r\n24.\r\n\r\nAfter the election Walsh served notice on Kelly that he would contest\r\nhis seat, on the ground that illegal votes had been cast in the\r\nFourteenth Ward, where the majority against Walsh was quite large. Mr.\r\nKelly at once acted on information that had been given to him by a\r\nfriend of Walsh’s father, the late John Griffin, that Walsh was not a\r\ncitizen of the United States, his father not having been naturalized,\r\nand he himself having neglected to take out citizen’s papers when he\r\nreached the proper age. He was not, therefore, a citizen of the United\r\nStates. A certificate of his baptism was procured from the parish\r\npriest at Bandon, Ireland, where he was born, and Walsh, fearing the\r\nresult of an exposure, withdrew, and the contest ended.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent career of Mr. Walsh was a checkered one. He was\r\nemployed by George Steers, the well-known ship-builder, as his agent\r\nto go to Russia to negotiate a contract in his favor to build ships\r\nfor that Government. Walsh obtained letters of introduction from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy of the United States to officials of the Russian\r\nGovernment, and set out on his mission with fair prospects of a\r\nsuccessful issue to the business. Instead, however, of conducting the\r\naffair well, the unfortunate man fell into riotous living in Europe,\r\nand spent the remittances his employer sent to him. He returned to the\r\nUnited States in the steerage of one of the steamships plying between\r\nLiverpool and New York.\r\n\r\nHe was never a candidate for office again, after his memorable contest\r\nwith Mr. Kelly in 1854. In the winter of 1859 poor Mike, while on his\r\nway home one night, slipped and fell down a cellar-way on the 8th\r\nAvenue, near 16th Street, and was supposed to have been instantly\r\nkilled, as he was found dead the next morning by the police. Although\r\nat the time it was thought that he had been murdered, the evidence\r\ntaken at the inquest showed that this was not the case, and the jury\r\nreturned their verdict that his death was caused by an accidental fall\r\nin an open cellar-way. His death called forth expressions of profound\r\nsorrow in New York, for, in spite of the infirmities of his nature,\r\nMike Walsh had a powerful hold on the popular mind, and over his\r\nnew-made grave many an eye was dimmed with unhidden grief, and all that\r\nwas gentle and noble in his nature was feelingly recalled.\r\n\r\nAlthough John Kelly had been an ardent Hunker, or Cass and Butler man,\r\nin 1848, he was now acting with the Soft Shells, having, when the\r\nreconciliation took place between the Hunker and Barnburner factions\r\nin 1849, followed the leadership of William L. Marcy and Horatio\r\nSeymour, the two eminent Hunkers, who became Soft Shells. It was by\r\nthe Soft Shells he was nominated against Walsh in 1854. The country\r\nwas roused to a high pitch of excitement by the Kansas imbroglio\r\nwhen he took his seat as a Representative of the city of New York in\r\nthe Thirty-fourth Congress. For the first time in the history of the\r\ngovernment a purely sectional candidate, sustained exclusively by\r\nsectional votes, was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives\r\nin 1856. This was Nathaniel P. Banks, of Waltham, Massachusetts. The\r\nstruggle was the most bitter and protracted one that ever took place\r\nin the House, beginning when Congress assembled on the first Monday\r\nof December, 1855, and continuing from day to day for nine weeks. The\r\ncontending forces were so evenly balanced, and party spirit ran so\r\nhigh, that it seemed impossible to break the dead-lock. There were\r\nthree candidates in the field, and the followers of each supported\r\ntheir respective favorites with unflinching resolution. William A.\r\nRichardson of Illinois, who had brought in the Kansas-Nebraska bill\r\nat the last session, and carried it through successfully, was the\r\ncaucus nominee of the Democrats; Nathaniel P. Banks, of Massachusetts,\r\nof the Republicans; and Henry M. Fuller, of Pennsylvania, of the\r\nKnow-Nothings. It was the beginning of the great sectional conflict,\r\nand the ominous mutterings of the storm were now heard in the House\r\nof Representatives whose thunder in a few years was to break forth on\r\na hundred battle-fields. There was Joshua R. Giddings, the ancient\r\nAbolitionist, who for years like Cassandra in the gates had been\r\nuttering prophecies of woe, and now in anticipation of victory was\r\ngoading the Hotspurs of the South to fury, such as Keitt, and Brooks,\r\nand Caskie, and Bowie, and Extra Billy Smith, and Fayette McMullin.\r\nThere, too, were Humphrey Marshall, Henry Winter Davis, Zollicoffer\r\nand Cullen, Know-Nothing birds of evil, shouting their No-Popery cry\r\nin the House, like Lord George Gordon in the British Parliament,\r\nseventy-five years before. There were Alexander H. Stephens, who on the\r\noutbreak of sectionalism left the Whigs forever, and now took sides\r\nwith the National Democrats, John Kelly, Howell Cobb, James L. Orr, and\r\nWilliam A. Richardson, marshalling the forces of the administration,\r\nand striving to pluck success from the aggressive and powerful\r\nsectionalists. They would have succeeded in electing the Democratic\r\ncandidate, William Aiken, finally settled upon in place of Messrs.\r\nRichardson and Orr, but for the officious intermeddling of a blunderer,\r\nwho revealed the plans of the Democrats before they were fully matured,\r\nand nominated Aiken in a theatrical speech which repelled the two or\r\nthree wavering votes, only needed to elect him. This was Williamson\r\nR. W. Cobb of Alabama. In the homely words of Mr. Stephens, as will\r\nbe explained more fully a few pages further on, he “plugged the melon\r\nbefore it was ripe.”[23] It was true that Aiken was first nominated\r\nby John Kelly in a few tentative words, that attracted several and\r\ndid not repel any votes. Mr. Kelly made no kite-flying speech, and\r\nthe anti-Banks Whigs, such as John Scott Harrison, Haven, Cullen and\r\nBarclay, who opposed an out-and-out Democrat, were interested in Mr.\r\nKelly’s off-hand manner of presenting William Aiken’s name, and showed\r\na disposition to vote for him as against Banks. Harrison had avowed his\r\nintention to do so.[24] But W. R. W. Cobb of Alabama, let the secret\r\nout that Aiken was the Democratic dark horse, and the masterly plans\r\nof Alexander H. Stephens and John Kelly, just as victory was in reach,\r\nwere dashed to the ground. An opinion further prevailed among many\r\nthat one or two Democrats were corruptly bought off.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of December, 1855, after nearly two weeks had been spent\r\nin a fruitless effort to organize the House, John Letcher of Virginia\r\nproposed that all the members should resign, and new elections be\r\nheld. This proposal was not made seriously, but rather as a protest\r\nagainst the dead-lock. Joshua R. Giddings of Ohio chose to treat\r\nthe proposition seriously, and on the 18th of December spoke of the\r\nDemocrats as follows: “These are the gentlemen who propose here to\r\nthe majority of the House, that we shall resign and go home, if they\r\nwill. The proposition is unfair. We are endeavoring to organize this\r\nHouse; they are endeavoring to prevent an organization. To illustrate\r\nmy idea, I will remark that I am reminded of the criminal standing upon\r\nthe gallows, the rope fastened to the beam over his head and around\r\nhis neck, the drop on which he stands sustained by a single cord,\r\nwhich the sheriff stands ready with his hatchet to cut. ‘Now,’ says\r\nthe criminal to the sheriff, ‘if you will resign, I will, and we will\r\ngo home together, and appeal to the people.’ Let me say to gentlemen,\r\nwe are each of us now writing our biography with more rapidity than\r\nwe generally imagine. Gentlemen of the Democratic party, I say again,\r\nin your attempt to extend this sectional institution, you have called\r\ndown the vengeance of the American people upon your heads. The\r\nhandwriting upon the wall has been seen and read of all men. Your\r\nhistory is written, and your doom is sealed; the sentence is pronounced\r\nagainst you, ‘depart, ye cursed!’ I have already given my views upon\r\nRepublicanism. They are expressed in the language of that immortal\r\ninstrument the Declaration of Independence. That is the foundation of\r\nmy Republicanism, as it is that of a vast majority of the Whigs and\r\nKnow-Nothings of the North. You, gentlemen of the Democratic party,\r\nstand forth here denying this doctrine. You say men are not endowed by\r\ntheir Creator with the inalienable right of liberty. * * * I would to\r\nGod I could proclaim to every slave in Virginia to-day—You have the\r\nright of self-defence, and when the master attempts to exercise the\r\nright of dominion over you, slay him as he would slay yourselves!”[25]\r\n\r\nHere then the incendiary appeal in favor of a servile insurrection,\r\nwhich John Brown tried to carry out with arms in 1859, was openly made\r\non the floor of Congress in 1855.\r\n\r\nThat Giddings was either blinded by his fanaticism, or was a dishonest\r\npettifogger, became clearly established a few weeks after he made this\r\nseditious speech. On the 18th of January, 1856, the House still being\r\nin the wrangle over the Speakership, Mr. Giddings took the floor,\r\nand advocated the adoption of the plurality rule. Mr. Banks had the\r\nlargest number of votes of the several candidates. Giddings, who had\r\nbitterly opposed this rule in 1849, now, to help his candidate, as\r\nearnestly advocated it.\r\n\r\nHe said: “We have but one precedent in the history of the Government\r\nfor our guidance. In 1849 this body found itself in the same condition\r\nfor three weeks that it now finds itself in during almost seven weeks.\r\nThere were then, as now, three parties in the House. No one party\r\nhad sufficient numbers to decide the election. No one party now has\r\nsufficient numbers to elect.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jones of Tennessee rose to a question of order.\r\n\r\nMr. Giddings: “I do not blame the gentleman (Mr. Jones) for rising to\r\na question of order. He then stood with the party which established a\r\nprecedent which shall go down in all time to the condemnation of his\r\nparty. I mean that under the circumstances, the Democratic party, as\r\na party, in its caucus, speaking by a party organ, then declared the\r\nplurality rule to be the proper and only rule which could be adopted\r\nfor the organization of the House.”\r\n\r\nMr. Howell Cobb, “Mr. Clerk, the gentleman is mistaken.”\r\n\r\nMr. Giddings: “No, sir; I stand upon the record. I have the record\r\nbefore me, and the gentleman must contradict that before he contradicts\r\nme. I read from the Congressional Globe. ‘The House had now’ says the\r\nrecord, ‘reached the contingency contemplated in the proposition of\r\nMr. Stanton. It had exhausted the three votings therein provided for,\r\nwithout a result, and had arrived at that point where, in fulfillment\r\nof an agreement entered into between the two parties, a Speaker was\r\nto be elected by a plurality vote.’ Here, sir, stands the record. Now\r\nwe stand precisely where we then stood. I do not know the number of\r\ntimes that we, on this side of the House, have endeavored to follow\r\nthis established precedent that was then adopted. It was adopted by\r\ngentlemen on the other side of the House, and under it the gentleman\r\nfrom Georgia (Mr. Cobb) himself was exalted to that chair. The\r\nRepublican party stands ready to carry out that precedent now. The\r\nRepublicans stand upon the great principle which was avowed by both of\r\nthe great parties, Whigs and Democrats.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb: “I corrected the gentleman in a statement of fact. I rise\r\nnow for the purpose of putting that statement correctly before the\r\ncountry in connection with his remarks. He stated that the Democratic\r\nparty had in 1849 adopted the plurality resolution in caucus. The truth\r\nis simply this: the plurality rule was adopted in caucus by the Whig\r\nparty. When it was reported by the Committee of Conference of the two\r\nparties to the Democratic caucus, it was rejected there by a decided\r\nmajority. And, if he desires to stand by the record, there was no man\r\non the floor more violent or more denunciatory of the operation of the\r\nplurality rule than the gentleman from Ohio. My recollection is that\r\nhe offered a substitute for it, which declared that it was wrong in\r\nprinciple, dangerous in its tendency, and ought not to be adopted.”\r\n\r\nMr. Giddings: “I only repeat what was said by a leading member of the\r\nDemocratic party, the Hon. Mr. Stanton, of Tennessee, on this floor,\r\nand in the presence of the gentleman from Georgia, and his party in\r\nthis House. That gentleman sat silently in his seat when Mr. Stanton\r\ndeclared the plurality rule to have been agreed to by the Committee,\r\nand he did not deny it; no member of his party denied the fact. I\r\ncall the attention of the country to the fact that in their caucus\r\nthe Democratic party, as a party, agreed with the Whig party, as a\r\nparty, that this should be the rule. I do not involve gentlemen; I only\r\ninvolve the Democratic party. I mean to pin it on that party.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edmundson: “Anybody who asserts that the Democratic party agreed to\r\nadopt the plurality rule, asserts what is not true.”\r\n\r\nMr. Orr: “I was present on the occasion to which I suppose reference is\r\nmade; and I state distinctly that no such resolution as that referred\r\nto by the gentleman from Ohio was adopted by the Democratic caucus,\r\neither directly or indirectly.”\r\n\r\nMr. Millson, and other members who had attended the Democratic caucus\r\nof 1849, made similar denials.\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb: “Fortunately the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Stanton),\r\nalthough not a member of this House, is here, and I assert, without one\r\nword of conference with him, that he never intended to say before this\r\nHouse, nor did a single member of the House at that time so construe\r\nhis language—that the Democratic party had adopted the plurality rule\r\nin caucus.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Jones, of Tennessee, referred to the _Globe_ of 1849,\r\nand showed that the words put in Mr. Stanton’s mouth by Mr. Giddings\r\nhad not been used by him at all, but were words of the reporter\r\ndistinctly employed in another connection. This revelation, so damaging\r\nto Mr. Giddings’s character for fair dealing, was clinched by Mr.\r\nLetcher, who quoted from a speech made in the House by Mr. Giddings\r\nhimself, in 1849, five days after the adoption of the plurality rule,\r\nin which he declared the Whig party had forced the rule upon the House.\r\nHaving quoted the passage from Mr. Giddings’s speech contradictory of\r\nhimself, Mr. Letcher remarked: “Now, Sir, I submit that whatever may\r\nhave been the opinion of other people, it does not become the gentleman\r\nfrom Ohio to rise here in his place, and undertake to charge that\r\nthe Democratic party adopted that rule, after he has sent out to the\r\ncountry and published a speech, revised and printed in pamphlet form,\r\nin which he purports to give the facts as they occurred in 1849.”\r\n\r\nMr. Giddings: “I repeat what I said when I first rose, that the\r\nDemocratic party in its caucus, speaking through its committee, did\r\nagree to the resolution.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edmundson: “I want to let the gentleman from Ohio know that he is\r\nasserting what is not true. I am stating facts within my own knowledge.\r\nThe Democratic caucus voted down the resolution, and refused to adopt\r\nit. Now, any statement made in conflict with that, I say this from my\r\nown personal knowledge, is a statement which is not true, and he who\r\nmakes it knows, at the time he is making it, that it is not true.”\r\n\r\nMr. Giddings:\r\n\r\n    “‘Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,\r\n      And make your bondmen tremble,’\r\n\r\nbut do not come here to make any imputations upon me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edmundson (advancing towards Mr. Giddings, who had sprung\r\nShakespeare on him unexpectedly): “I want to hear what the gentleman\r\nfrom Ohio is saving.”\r\n\r\nMr. Giddings: “Let gentlemen keep cool.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edmundson: “I will keep cool, if you will state the facts.”\r\n\r\nAt this point there were loud cries of “Order, order,” and much\r\nconfusion and excitement in the hall.\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb: “When the gentlemen from Ohio stated that the Democratic\r\nparty had adopted as a party the plurality rule, I unhesitatingly\r\ndenied that statement. When he said that the resolution was introduced\r\nby Mr. Stanton, he read the language of Mr. Stanton to show that he\r\nmade the statement to the House, and to the country, to that effect.\r\nI stated then that it was a misconstruction of the language of Mr.\r\nStanton, and that it must have been so from the facts as they were.\r\nNow, Mr. Clerk, I ask this House, and I put it to the candor of every\r\nman on this floor, if, at the time this declaration was made, it was\r\nnot its understanding that the language quoted was the language of Mr.\r\nStanton?”\r\n\r\nSeveral members: “He so stated, expressly.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cobb: “I put it to the memory and candor of gentlemen here, if the\r\ngentleman from Ohio did not so intend it, then he made a charge against\r\nthe party without any particle of ground to stand on. If he did intend\r\nit, it was an effort to falsify the record on which he was standing.\r\nThis language was the language of the reporter, giving an account of\r\nthe proceedings of the day, and does not occur in connection with Mr.\r\nStanton’s name at all. There is a vote intervening between the time\r\nwhen Mr. Stanton addressed the House, and the remarks here made by\r\nthe reporter, which had no earthly connection with them whatever.\r\nWhere, then, is the point of the gentleman’s remarks when he charges me\r\nwith sitting by and allowing Mr. Stanton to state that the plurality\r\nproposition was the result of an agreement between the two parties,\r\nunless it be because he had put in Mr. Stanton’s mouth the language of\r\nthe reporter? I submit the facts to the House; I shall not characterize\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nMr. Orr: “Since the debate commenced, Mr. Stanton has come within the\r\nlimits of this hall. I have had an interview with him, and he has\r\nauthorized me to state, that when the proposition to elect by plurality\r\nwas presented to the Democratic caucus, it was almost unanimously\r\nrejected by them, and that when he offered the plurality resolution he\r\ndid it upon his own individual responsibility.”\r\n\r\nThese crushing refutations of the charges of Mr. Giddings raise a\r\nstrong doubt of his honesty in this matter. He was a sharp politician,\r\nand sought without regard to the means to elect Mr. Banks Speaker of\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\nThe Know-Nothings, recruited as were the Republicans from the\r\nsame parent stem of John Adams Federalism, were the allies of the\r\nSectionalists led by Mr. Giddings in 1856. The folly of the Southern\r\nKnow-Nothings in the great conflict over the Speakership in the\r\nThirty-fourth Congress was remarkable.\r\n\r\nSome of them, like Zollicoffer and Humphrey Marshall, were afterwards\r\nsuch violent Secessionists that they became Generals in the Confederate\r\narmy. Even Henry Winter Davis was so much opposed to the Republican\r\nparty at this time, and for several years after, that he denounced it\r\nas a miserable, useless faction, and sneeringly asked, “Why cumbers\r\nit the ground?” Mr. Zollicoffer, a Southern man, of no mean powers,\r\nwith surprising inconsistency refused to vote for a Democratic\r\ncandidate for Speaker when none other had the remotest chance to\r\nbeat Banks, and at the same time inveighed against Mr. Campbell, a\r\nPennsylvania Know-Nothing, for voting for Banks, and thereby aiding the\r\nSectionalists in opening the door for disunion and civil war. These\r\nmen and their congeners in bigotry, like the blood-stained fanatic\r\nLord George Gordon before them, strove to excite a religious war, and\r\npreached proscription of foreigners, and persecution of Catholics in\r\nthe American Congress. No union with slaveholders, was the platform of\r\nJoshua R. Giddings; no-Popery, and no citizenship for foreigners, the\r\nplatform of Henry Winter Davis.\r\n\r\n“I go against the Catholics,” said Mr. Cullen of Delaware, during the\r\nsame Speakership contest. “I never will support them. They are not fit\r\nto be supported by Americans. The people of the State from which I come\r\nlook upon them with abhorrence. A Catholic priest, a short time ago,\r\ncame among us. He was a stranger. He taught the doctrine of purgatory.\r\nAfter he had proclaimed that doctrine, an honorable gentleman of the\r\nState of Delaware, and who at the last election ran for Governor on the\r\nsame ticket with myself, declared that he ought to be egged! I vote\r\nagainst the Catholics!”\r\n\r\nMr. Dowdell, of Alabama: “I am exceedingly pained at the spectacle\r\nwhich has been presented to-night. When Rome was burning Nero was\r\nfiddling and dancing. Now, sir, we are standing upon a slumbering\r\nvolcano. Upon our borders in the common territory of this country,\r\nour people are marshalling their forces to try the great question\r\nwhether they are able to govern themselves, it may be with rifles in\r\ntheir hands. I have been reminded by the ludicrous scenes witnessed\r\nhere of a parallel to be found in a book entitled, ‘Georgia Scenes.’\r\nNed Brace, the hero of the story, happened to be in a city during the\r\nprevalence of a great fire, the flames in red volumes were rising\r\nhigher and higher each moment, the people were running to and fro in\r\ngreat consternation, women and children were screaming through the\r\nstreets, and the midnight fire-bells were sending out their rapid and\r\nstartling sounds, when Ned quietly took his position on the sidewalk.\r\nAbout this time a large old man, nearly out of breath, came running by\r\nin great haste, whose home was threatened with destruction perhaps,\r\nand was abruptly stopped by Ned with the interrogatory: ‘Sir, can you\r\ntell me where I can find Peleg Q. C. Stone?’ ‘Damn Peleg Q. C. Stone,\r\nmy house is on fire;’ was the impatient reply. Now, sir, while the fire\r\nof civil war is threatening to be kindled upon our borders, questions\r\nare propounded here quite as impertinent at this time of danger, and\r\ncalculated to provoke similar impatience, if not a similar reply.\r\nI have no fear that any party in this country opposed to religious\r\nliberty will ever be strong enough to control its legislation.”\r\n\r\nMr. Paine, of North Carolina: “I ask whether any gentleman in this\r\nHouse is willing to see the Government of the United States, and the\r\nCongress of the United States, in the hands of the Roman Catholics of\r\nthis country? This is a matter which enters into the private feelings,\r\nhowever unwilling members may be to expose it. These very gentlemen\r\nthemselves would not trust the government of the country and Congress\r\nin the hands of Roman Catholics.”\r\n\r\nMr. Valk, of New York: “The honorable gentleman from Alabama (Mr.\r\nDowdell) took occasion to draw the attention of the House to the once\r\nliving embodiment of that portrait on my right—that of La Fayette. I\r\nfrankly and freely do honor to his memory. But the gentleman forgets\r\none remark which fell from the lips of that man when living. He said:\r\n‘If ever the liberties of this country are destroyed it will be by\r\nCatholic priests.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Bowie of Maryland: “Sparks says that is a lie.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. Kelly tried to get the floor to repel the furious\r\nassaults of the Know-Nothings upon his church, of which the preceding\r\nextracts are but a few specimens.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I should like to explain my vote.”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk: “The clerk would remind the gentleman from New York that it\r\nis too late. He can proceed, however, if no objection is made.” There\r\nwere loud cries of “object!”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Does the Clerk decide that I am not in order?”\r\n\r\nThe Clerk: “The Clerk makes no decision.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pennington: “I move that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Kelly)\r\nhave leave to explain his vote, and I do so because the gentleman is a\r\nCatholic, and the only one I believe of that faith upon this floor. I\r\nthink that under the circumstances it would be only common courtesy to\r\nhear him.” Loud cries of “Hear him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bowie: “Hear him; he is the only Catholic here.”\r\n\r\nMr. Washburn: “I will yield to the gentleman for ten minutes.” Mr.\r\nKelly, without previous preparation, now proceeded to make his second\r\nspeech in the House, January 9, 1856, his first having been delivered\r\nDecember 19, 1855, in reply to Mr. Whitney, a New York Know-Nothing.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I am aware, Mr. Clerk, that it is very improper to bring\r\nreligious matters into legislative business at all but when I hear such\r\nremarks as have fallen from the intelligent gentleman who has just\r\nspoken, I feel that it becomes me, as a member of the religious body\r\nwhich the gentleman has been assailing, to say something, at least, in\r\nits defense.\r\n\r\n“The accusation is made here that the Catholic religion is dangerous\r\nto the institutions of this Republic. Sir, no man possessed of any\r\nintelligence would give any weight to a charge of that sort. When\r\nhave the Catholic clergy urged their flocks to support particular\r\nindividuals for office? When have they from their pulpits urged their\r\ncongregations to support particular measures, or to vote for particular\r\nmen? There is not in the history of this country an instance in which\r\nthe Catholic clergy have so acted. But can the same be said of other\r\nreligious denominations in this country? In the Eastern portion of the\r\nUnion you will frequently find ministers from their pulpits invoking\r\ntheir flocks to vote for measures which interest them, and the section\r\nof the Union to which they belong. Now, Mr. Clerk, I am a Catholic,\r\nand I love this Union. I defy any man in this Congress to say that he\r\nis a better citizen, or more devoted to the true interests of this\r\nUnion than I am. This is not only my sentiment, but it is the sentiment\r\nof the religious body to which I belong. It is the sentiment of our\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\n“I let the accusation that the Catholic religion is dangerous to our\r\nbeloved country, go for what it is worth; for I am satisfied that\r\nno sane man would make such an assertion. But this charge has been\r\nfrequently made since we first met here. When my colleague, Mr. Valk,\r\nmade several charges against the Catholic religion, I had not an\r\nopportunity to say one word in reply but, sir, I am surprised that the\r\ngentleman from Long Island, a man of intelligence and a Christian,\r\nas I take him to be, should rise upon this floor, and denounce his\r\nfellow Christians because he differs with them in opinion upon\r\nreligious questions.” Mr. Valk, who had indulged in such denunciation,\r\nnevertheless, made a denial at this point.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Paine, asks, would\r\nyou like to see this Government in the hands of the Catholic people?\r\nSuppose that it was in the hands of the Catholic people, have the\r\nCatholic people of this Union ever been false to its true interests?\r\nWhy, sir, look at the early history of our country, and look to that\r\nState which borders upon this District. A Catholic community existed\r\nthere, which extended a liberality to all other religions that could\r\nnot be found in other colonies at that time. While Calvert, Lord\r\nBaltimore, was founding a free colony there, religious persecution was\r\ngoing on in other colonies; and when people were persecuted in other\r\ncolonies, where did they go that they might worship God according\r\nto the dictates of their own consciences? They came to the Catholic\r\ncolony of Maryland. These are the Catholic people to whom the honorable\r\ngentleman from Alabama has referred. Such, sir, is the history of the\r\nCatholics in this country, and such has it ever been. These people when\r\nthey leave their homes in Germany, in Ireland, or in whatever country\r\nthey may be found, and come here, it is to make this country their\r\nhome. They imbibe the spirit of true patriotism before they leave the\r\nOld World. They come here with their parents, brethren, and friends,\r\nbecause here they can enjoy their liberty. And tell me, sir, is not\r\nthe assertion, that they are inimical to your liberties unfounded? Are\r\nnot the people who make it blinded by prejudice and bigotry? Why, sir,\r\nforeigners have always composed a large portion of the army of the\r\ncountry. They have fought side by side with our native-born citizens\r\nin every battle that has been fought from the earliest period of\r\nour existence as a nation, down to the present time. They have been\r\nworking in a common cause to promote common objects—the blessings and\r\nprosperity of this Union. Let me say to this House, if they come not\r\nhere with wealth, they come with willing hands to work and earn their\r\nbread upon your public works, from their very commencement to their\r\ncompletion. How could your great public works have been constructed\r\nwithout these men?”\r\n\r\nThe Know-Nothings, not liking Kelly’s argument, at this point made a\r\ndetermined effort to cut him off.\r\n\r\nMr. Russell Sage, of New York: “I move that this House do now proceed\r\nto vote for Speaker, and upon that motion I demand the previous\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, of Alabama: “I hope the gentleman from New York, Mr. Kelly,\r\nwill be allowed to proceed with his explanation.”\r\n\r\nMr. Eustis, of Louisiana: “I hope Mr. Kelly will be allowed to proceed\r\nby unanimous consent.”\r\n\r\nSeveral members objected.\r\n\r\nMr. Leiter, of Ohio: “I appeal to the House to withdraw all objection,\r\nand allow the gentleman from New York to go on with his speech.”\r\nObjection was again made.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I do not care about proceeding further. I wished to deny\r\nthe charges made by the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Paine, and\r\nby the gentleman from New York, Mr. Valk, and having done that I am\r\nsatisfied to let the matter rest for the present.”[26]\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly, had he not been cut off by objections, intended to read\r\nthe letter of La Fayette, written from Paris in 1829 to a Protestant\r\ncitizen of New York, whose guest the old patriot had been during his\r\nlast visit to this country. This letter Mr. Valk had grossly perverted.\r\nAt the earliest opportunity during that session Mr. Kelly replied to\r\nMr. Valk and Mr. Smith, and read the La Fayette letter. The sentences\r\nin it which Mr. Valk had so garbled were in reality as follows:—“But I\r\nmust be permitted to assure you that the fears which in your patriotic\r\nzeal you seem to entertain, that if ever the liberty of the United\r\nStates is destroyed it will be by Romish priests, are certainly without\r\nany shadow of foundation whatever. An intimate acquaintance of more\r\nthan half a century with the prominent and influential priests and\r\nmembers of that Church, both in England and America, warrant me in\r\nassuring you that you need entertain no apprehension of danger to your\r\nrepublican institutions from that quarter.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Captain Rynders died suddenly about the middle of January, 1885,\r\nhaving enjoyed his usual good health up to within a few hours of his\r\ndemise.\r\n\r\n[23] Life of A.

STEPHENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter the strange spectacle was presented of Southern\r\nKnow-Nothings, while declaring their opposition to the Abolitionists,\r\nactually aiding them to elect a Speaker, and offering as an excuse for\r\ntheir conduct the dread that the Catholic Church might obtain control\r\nof the Government! The Democratic caucus had adopted a resolution\r\ndenouncing the enemies of civil and religious liberty. Humphrey\r\nMarshall and the Southern Know-Nothings declared this was an insult to\r\nthem, and not only Marshall, but Cox of Kentucky, and Zollicoffer and\r\nEtheridge assigned the same cause as presenting an insuperable obstacle\r\nto their voting for any Democrat for Speaker. The Know-Nothings and\r\nAbolitionists, having nothing in common, united to overthrow the party\r\nof the Constitution, the former to prevent the Catholics from seizing\r\nthe Government, the latter to get rid of slavery. This ridiculous\r\npretext of the Know-Nothings concerning the political ambition of the\r\nCatholic Church was most effectively answered by the fact that out of\r\nthe whole 234 members of the House, and 7 Territorial Delegates, John\r\nKelly was the only Catholic in the Thirty-fourth Congress. Mr. Kelly\r\ndeclared truly that no sane man would offer such an insult to the\r\nintelligence of the country, as a justification for his conduct, but\r\nDavis of Maryland, Cullen of Delaware, Whitney of New York, and other\r\nproscriptionists were wedded to their idols, and in order to strike\r\ndown an imaginary enemy, they became the tools of a real one.\r\n\r\nFor nine weeks the stubborn contest continued. The country, from one\r\nend to another, was roused to feverish excitement. It was the first\r\ntime the Republican party had shown front in a National contest. Ever\r\nsince the Seward-Fillmore quarrel had led to the overthrow of the Whig\r\nparty in 1853, the Freesoilers had been a heterogeneous mass of the\r\nNorthern population, unorganized, and with no common object in view.\r\nMr. Seward keenly felt that success in the present struggle for the\r\nSpeakership was vital to the perpetuity of the Republican party. He\r\nsummoned to Washington his ablest friends, Thurlow Weed, Horace Greeley\r\nand James Watson Webb. These four famous leaders soon organized their\r\nfollowers in the House into a compact body. Mr. Zollicoffer, who\r\nsubsequently became a Secessionist, and fell in battle as a Confederate\r\nGeneral, characterized them by name on the floor of the House as the\r\nchiefs of the lobby. In the course of a speech on the 20th of December,\r\nin which he declared, with a short-sightedness unworthy of so clever a\r\nman, that he would not vote for a Democrat against Banks, Zollicoffer\r\nsaid: “I see here a great organization, numbering from one hundred and\r\nfour to one hundred and six members, who are steadily voting for Mr.\r\nBanks. Whilst I have reason to believe that the great lobby spirits\r\nwho control that organization are Greeley and Seward, and Weed and\r\nWebb, men of intellect and power at the North, who are as bitterly\r\nopposed to the American party as they are to the Democratic party, I\r\ndo, upon my conscience, believe that there are gentlemen voting for\r\nMr. Banks, from day to day, who do not belong to the Abolition, or,\r\nas they style themselves, the Republican organization. For example, I\r\ncite the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Campbell), at whose position,\r\nas he announced it here the other day, I was surprised. He says he is\r\nan American, and he spurned the idea that the American party at the\r\nNorth were identified with the Freesoilers of the North and yet he\r\ncasts his vote steadily against a conservative National American of\r\nhis own State, and gives it to Mr. Banks, a Free Soil Democrat, who\r\nhas affiliated, as his record clearly shows, with the most ultra and\r\nviolent Free-soil and Abolition factions.”\r\n\r\nThe Capitol was alive with intrigues and with intriguers from every\r\npart of the country. The leaders retired to the Committee rooms day by\r\nday, and night by night, and runners kept them constantly informed of\r\nthe movements of their adversaries. Counter-movements followed, and\r\nnew plans succeeded each other on every side without avail. It was an\r\ninteresting moment for the historian; the events of the hour were big\r\nwith the fate of the country. Federalism and Democracy were once more,\r\nas in the year 1801, locked in a death struggle. Then, as now, it was\r\nthe party of the Constitution against the party of Centralization. The\r\nKnow-Nothings held the balance of power, and of course the followers\r\nof the man who wrote his own epitaph in these words, “Author of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and of the Statutes of Virginia for\r\nReligious Freedom,” had nothing to expect from that pestilent band of\r\nbigots. Sprung from the same parent stem of John Adams Federalism,\r\nJoshua R. Giddings and his Abolitionists, and Henry Winter Davis\r\nand his Know-Nothings, were natural allies against the disciples of\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\nSeward, Weed and Greeley, to their credit be it recorded, having led\r\nthe anti-Know-Nothing branch of the Whig party in New York, were\r\nnot personally influential with members of the American party in\r\nCongress. But the Republican leaders were men of varied resources,\r\nand Thurlow Weed, the Whig Warwick, was equal to any emergency. The\r\nfierce philippics of Henry A. Wise against the Know-Nothings in the\r\nmemorable Virginia campaign just closed, and the tremendous blows\r\nwhich Alexander H. Stephens had dealt the party of dark lanterns in\r\nhis then recent Georgia campaign, were artfully spread abroad among\r\nthe proscriptionists in Congress, and the bitterness of their defeat\r\nin both those States added to the chagrin which the unanswerable\r\narraignments of Wise and Stephens excited among them. The resolutions\r\nof the Democratic caucus, especially the one denouncing the enemies\r\nof civil and religious liberty, and the alleged contradictory\r\nconstructions placed upon the Kansas-Nebraska bill by Northern and\r\nSouthern Democrats, were also used by the Seward men as electioneering\r\nappeals for Mr. Banks. In one or two Democratic quarters the Republican\r\nleaders were strongly suspected of employing corrupt appliances.\r\n\r\nThe great anti-Know-Nothing speech of Alexander H. Stephens at\r\nAugusta, largely quoted from in a former chapter of this book, was\r\nnow being used by the Republicans to increase Know-Nothing enmity to\r\nthe Democrats. On his part Mr. Stephens was a tower of strength to\r\nthe Administration men in the House. He appreciated the magnitude of\r\nthe struggle, and was indefatigable in his attempts to defeat the\r\nRepublican and Know-Nothing alliance. He rejoiced at the prominence\r\nwhich the Republican leaders were giving to the victory over\r\nKnow-Nothingism in his own State. “I think,” he said in a letter to his\r\nbrother, “the Georgia election is more talked of than that of any other\r\nState in the Union.”[27]\r\n\r\nLewis Cass, Stephen A. Douglas, C. C. Clay, R. M. T. Hunter, Judah P.\r\nBenjamin, and other Democratic Senators, were in frequent consultation\r\nwith Alexander H. Stephens, John Kelly, Howell Cobb, James L. Orr,\r\nWilliam A. Richardson, and other Democratic members of the House. The\r\nrelative strength of the two leading parties in the House, seventy-four\r\nDemocrats and one hundred and four Republicans, was the subject of\r\nanxious thought, and all at length saw that Mr. Richardson, the caucus\r\nnominee of the Democrats, could not be elected. He was, therefore,\r\ndropped, and James L. Orr substituted as the Democratic candidate. As\r\nweek after week elapsed, it became evident that the dead-lock could\r\nonly be broken by the abandonment of a straight party man by the\r\nDemocrats. Even then no election was likely to take place unless the\r\nplurality rule should be adopted. About ten days before the end of\r\nthe contest, as alluded to already, a private consultation took place\r\nbetween Mr. Stephens, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Orr, and Mr. Cobb, at which the\r\nnomination of William Aiken of South Carolina was decided upon as\r\nthat of the only available candidate against Banks. But in order to\r\nrender this movement effective, the utmost secrecy was necessary until\r\nthe time should have come to bring out the new candidate. This plan\r\noriginated with Mr. Stephens. Mr. Kelly entered heartily into it. To\r\nhim was assigned the important duty as a Northern Democrat of putting\r\nMr. Aiken in nomination. He was only to do this, when Banks’s election\r\nshould appear imminent, or after the plurality rule had been adopted,\r\nwith Orr still running against Banks. The nomination was not to be\r\nenforced by any set speech on the part of the mover, which might show\r\ndesign and premeditation, but was to be made as if on the impulse of\r\nthe moment, and as the sudden act of an individual who had given up all\r\nhope for Orr, and now named Aiken as a sort of dernier resort to beat\r\nBanks.\r\n\r\nIt showed that the Democratic leaders reposed extraordinary confidence\r\nin Kelly’s coolness, tact and good judgment, that he should have been\r\nselected to initiate this most delicate parliamentary move. Mr. Orr\r\nhad agreed to withdraw at the proper moment in Aiken’s favor. In the\r\nmeantime Mr. Stephens was to manage the preliminary strategy necessary\r\nto put the train of affairs in motion. He sounded various members in\r\ncasual conversation, and found men of the most opposite views quite\r\nfavorable to Aiken, as a compromise candidate against Banks. At length,\r\nFebruary first, when it seemed probable that Banks would be elected,\r\nand at the right moment, with admirable brevity and effect, John\r\nKelly rose and nominated Aiken. But before Orr could get the floor\r\nto withdraw in favor of Mr. Kelly’s nominee, Williamson R. W. Cobb,\r\nof Alabama, who had found members who were in the secret predicting\r\nthat Aiken would win, now sprang up and in a cut-and-dried-speech,\r\nand with a great parade of theatrical language, declared that the\r\ntime had arrived to name the winning man, that he had the pleasure of\r\noffering an olive-branch to all those who opposed the Republicans, and\r\nafter giving everybody to know that he was about to announce a grand\r\nparliamentary stroke on the part of the Democrats, he nominated William\r\nAiken of South Carolina. The effect of that supremely ill-timed speech\r\nwas to drive off votes which Mr. Aiken would have otherwise won, for as\r\nsoon as it dawned upon the Whigs and Know-Nothings, who had not gone\r\nover to Banks, that the latest move was a Democratic “olive-branch,”\r\na sufficient number of them reconsidered their intention to vote for\r\nAiken, and Banks was elected Speaker the next day, under the operation\r\nof that extra-constitutional device—the plurality rule.\r\n\r\nThe votes of John Hickman and David Barclay, two Democrats from\r\nPennsylvania, were not given on the final ballot to the candidate\r\nsupported by the Democratic side of the House. They were much censured\r\nfor their course.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Globe contains the following:\r\n\r\n“House of Representatives, Friday, February 1, 1856.\r\n\r\nMr. Ball. I offer the following resolutions, and upon it I demand the\r\nprevious question:\r\n\r\nResolved, That Nathaniel P. Banks, of Massachusetts, be, and he is\r\nhereby declared Speaker of this House for the Thirty-fourth Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly. I desire to offer a substitute for that resolution.\r\n\r\nThe Clerk. It is not in order to do so now, as the previous question\r\nhas been demanded.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly. Then I give notice, that if the pending resolution is voted\r\ndown, I shall hereafter offer the following:\r\n\r\nResolved, That William Aiken, of South Carolina, be, and he is hereby\r\nelected Speaker of this House, for the Thirty-fourth Congress.”\r\n\r\nThe resolution declaring Banks the Speaker was lost by 102 ayes to 115\r\nnoes. Then, before Mr. Kelly could obtain the floor to name Mr. Aiken,\r\nWilliamson R. W. Cobb made his fatal olive-branch speech in favor of\r\nAiken, and Mr. Washburne of Illinois moved to lay “that olive branch\r\non the table.” The House by a vote of 98 to 117 refused to table the\r\nresolution. The main question of declaring Aiken Speaker was then put\r\nand lost, ayes 103, noes 110. It will be observed that the vote for\r\nAiken was larger than that for Banks. Banks 102 to 115; Aiken 103 to\r\n110. Mr. Kelly would have had the honor of naming the Speaker but for\r\nthe precipitancy of Mr. W. R. W. Cobb. The plurality rule, a device\r\nof doubtful constitutionality, was adopted the next day, February 2d,\r\nand Banks was elected. The following was the vote: Banks 103; Aiken\r\n100; Fuller 6; Campbell 4; Wells 1. If Henry Winter Davis and the\r\nother five Know-Nothings who voted for Fuller, or even three of them,\r\nhad supported Mr. Aiken, his election would have taken place. Or if\r\nonly two of those Know-Nothings, and the two Democratic back-sliders,\r\nHickman and Barclay, had voted for Aiken, the defeat of Banks, and\r\nelection of the Democratic candidate, in this momentous national\r\ncontest would have resulted.\r\n\r\n“After a prolonged struggle,” says Mr. Blaine in his _Twenty Years\r\nof Congress_, “Nathaniel P. Banks was chosen Speaker over William\r\nAiken. It was a significant circumstance, noted at the time, that the\r\nsuccessful candidate came from Massachusetts, and the defeated one\r\nfrom South Carolina. It was a still more ominous fact that Banks was\r\nchosen by votes wholly from the free States, and that every vote from\r\nthe slave States was given to Mr. Aiken, except that of Mr. Cullen of\r\nDelaware, and that of Henry Winter Davis of Maryland, who declined to\r\nvote for either candidate. It was the first instance in the history of\r\nthe Government in which a candidate for Speaker had been chosen without\r\nsupport from both sections. It was a distinctive victory of the free\r\nStates over the consolidated power of the slave States. It marked an\r\nepoch.”[28] If William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed were here to explain\r\nthis “distinctive victory,” as Mr. Blaine calls it, they might, if they\r\nwere in a confessing mood, call the thing by another name.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that votes were thrown away on nominal candidates, and\r\nsome even were given for Mr. Banks which belonged rightfully to Mr.\r\nAiken. The members who cast those votes not only failed to reflect the\r\nsentiments of their constituencies, but in some cases openly defied\r\nand misrepresented the will of the voters to whom they owed their\r\nseats. Why these men betrayed the Democratic party in the memorable\r\nparliamentary battle which, as Mr. Blaine says “marked an epoch,”\r\nwill perhaps forever remain one of the mysteries of the lobby of that\r\neventful Thirty-fourth Congress.\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly, Howard Cobb and others strongly suspected that corrupt\r\nappliances were at work.\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens, in a letter to his brother Linton Stephens, February 1st,\r\n1856, said: “But for a _faux pas_ on the part of that fool C——, I think\r\nwe should have made Aiken Speaker to-day. I had set the programme\r\nfor it about ten days ago. My plan was this: after the plurality rule\r\nshould have been adopted (which I had all along believed after a while\r\nwould be), and two ballots should have been had under it, if the\r\nSouthern Know-Nothings should not indicate a purpose to go over to Orr\r\nto prevent Banks’s election (which I did not much expect them to do),\r\nthen Aiken was to be put in nomination on the floor, Orr to decline,\r\nand let the last vote be between Aiken and Banks. From my knowledge\r\nof the House, its present tone and temper, knowledge of Aiken and the\r\nestimation he was held in by several of the scatterers, I believed he\r\nwould beat Banks. This I communicated to a few, and a few only. I gave\r\nCobb, of Georgia, my idea; he was struck with it, and communicated\r\nit to a few others. It took finely. I sounded some of the Western\r\nKnow-Nothings,—Marshall and others,—and found that they could be\r\nbrought into it. I said nothing of my plan, but simply asked carelessly\r\nhow Aiken would do. I found that he would do for them. But after his\r\nname began to be talked of, he got so popular in the minds of many that\r\nC——, a fool, plugged the melon before it was ripe. If we had then been\r\nunder the pressure of the plurality rule, and the choice between him\r\nand Banks, he would have been elected, sure as fate, in my opinion.”[29]\r\n\r\nIn conversations with the writer of this memoir, and in letters to\r\nhim on the subject, Mr. Stephens often spoke of Mr. Kelly’s conduct\r\nduring this first great struggle between the Democratic and Republican\r\nparties in the House of Representatives, as truly admirable and\r\npatriotic. “Mr. Kelly,” said he, “never hounded on anybody against the\r\nSouth, but was one of the few Northern Democrats who then stood firmly\r\nby us, in defense of our Constitutional rights against the assaults\r\nof Republicans and Know-Nothings, who had formed an unholy alliance\r\nagainst us.” The present writer has sometimes read, with surprise,\r\nattacks on Mr. Kelly in Southern newspapers of respectability and\r\nstanding, such as the Baltimore _Sun_ and Atlanta _Constitution_,\r\nwhich only could be ascribed to insufficient information on the part\r\nof the writers, or perhaps they unintentionally erred in accepting the\r\nscurrilous caricatures of _Puck_, and other Gerrymanders, for the real\r\nJohn Kelly.\r\n\r\nMr. Banks appointed the standing Committees of the House in the\r\ninterest of the ultra wing of the Republican party, of which William H.\r\nSeward and Joshua R. Giddings were the leaders. M. Seward was at length\r\nat the head of a great organization, with the immense power of the\r\npopular branch of Congress at his back, and no other man in American\r\npolitics ever made more of his opportunities. Five years before he\r\nhad been rudely jostled from his dream of ambition by the death of\r\nPresident Taylor, to whose friendship for him he was indebted for\r\nhis elevation to leadership in the Whig party in 1849. That event had\r\nbeen rendered possible in consequence of the disastrous feuds in the\r\nDemocratic party of New York in 1848. While Hunkers and Barnburners\r\nfought, the Whigs captured the Legislature of New York, by which a\r\nSenator in Congress was to be chosen. Mr. Seward was elected Senator.\r\nHis political sagacity soon enabled him to grasp the situation. Deeming\r\nit certain that whoever might control the Administration patronage,\r\nwhether Senator or not, would control the politics of New York, he went\r\nto Washington, and paid assiduous court to that dashing Virginian,\r\nWilliam Ballard Preston, Secretary of the Navy, to whom President\r\nTaylor was more attached than to any other member of his Cabinet. As a\r\ncharmer Mr. Seward had few equals. He was addicted to aphorisms, and\r\nstudied _bon mots_ with the diligence of Sheridan. His affectation\r\nof philosophy was set off by good manners and easy address. He had\r\nbeen a school-master in Georgia, and had at his command a fund of\r\nSouth-of-Potomac reminiscences, saws, and anecdotes. In the company\r\nof William Ballard Preston he was never so happy as when expatiating\r\nover the types, and modes, and fascinations of Southern society. The\r\nTazewells, Randolphs, Gastons, Lowndes, Calhouns, Crawfords, Forsyths,\r\nLumpkins, and other famous Cavaliers, were all names familiar on\r\nMr. Seward’s lips as household words. It did not take him long\r\nto win Preston, and that gentleman soon addressed himself to the\r\ntask of winning over the President to the side of Mr. Seward. But\r\nVice-President Fillmore was Seward’s bitterest enemy, and Taylor’s\r\nconfidence was of slower growth than Preston’s. Fierce sectional\r\npassions upon the subject of slavery were already raging between the\r\nNorth and South, and the old hero of Buena Vista desired to allay\r\nthose passions, and render his Administration the era of pacification.\r\nPledges were finally exacted and given, James Watson Webb representing\r\nMr. Seward, and Secretary Preston representing the President, and the\r\npatronage of the Administration in New York was placed at Mr. Seward’s\r\ndisposal; in consideration of which that wily diplomat entered into\r\nengagements to take no part in the Senate of the United States in\r\nthe Abolition agitation, but to pursue a policy of conciliation and\r\ncompromise at Washington. He had been elected Senator to succeed a\r\nDemocrat. Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and John J. Crittenden, and the\r\nother leading Whigs in the Senate and House, were friends of Mr.\r\nFillmore, and unalterably opposed to Seward’s recognition by Taylor,\r\nupon any terms, as leader of the Administration party in New York.\r\nAngry controversies took place in Administration circles. A breach\r\noccurred between the President and Vice-President, and their social\r\nrelations were broken off. Preston had acquired complete personal\r\nascendency over Taylor, and the old soldier became a violent partisan\r\nof Mr. Seward. The Senator from New York was now recognized as the real\r\nleader of the Whig party, and wielded the Administration lash with\r\nexasperating indifference to the powerful men arrayed on the side of\r\nMr. Fillmore. Alienations took place between life-long friends, and\r\nmany of the great Whig statesmen were not even on speaking terms. The\r\nWhig party was rent in twain.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine has recently discussed some of the political events of\r\nthis period of American history, in his valuable work “Twenty Years\r\nof Congress,” but in assigning causes for the destruction of the Whig\r\nparty, he has strangely overlooked this portentous quarrel, provoked\r\nby Seward, which was the underlying cause,—the _causa causans_,—of the\r\ndissolution and utter extinction of that celebrated party.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of March, 1850, Mr. Seward, unmindful of his pledges to\r\nWilliam Ballard Preston, made a violent Abolition speech in the Senate.\r\nThe Georgia school-master has outwitted the Secretary of the Navy.\r\nCharles Francis Adams, in his memorial address at Albany on Mr. Seward,\r\nstated that he was aware of the “agreement,” as he called it, between\r\nthe Auburn statesman and Taylor’s Administration, but he must have been\r\nignorant of its real terms, for a descendant of two Presidents would\r\nscarcely have regarded the violation of voluntary pledges as a fit\r\ntopic for glowing eulogy.\r\n\r\nAnd now in that month of March, 1850, William H. Seward was at the\r\nheight of power. In all human probability he would be next President\r\nof the United States. Short-lived triumph. The summer of his glory was\r\nsoon overcast with stormy portents. Within four little months Zachary\r\nTaylor lay dead in the White House, and Fillmore, Seward’s dearest\r\nfoe, was President. The downfall of the Whig party soon followed, and\r\nMr. Seward and Winfield Scott sat amid its ruins. It was about this\r\ntime that Daniel Webster said to his friend Peter Harvey of Boston:\r\n“One of the convictions of my mind, and it is very strong, is that the\r\npeople of the United States will never entrust their destinies, and the\r\nadministration of their government, to the hands of William H. Seward\r\nand his associates.”[30]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Webster, perhaps, underestimated the character of Mr. Seward.\r\nIn 1856, upon the election of Nathaniel P. Banks as Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, the distinguished New York Senator became\r\ntitular primate of a new and more powerful organization than the\r\nWhig party ever had been in its palmiest days. England is governed\r\nby Cabinet Ministers with seats in Parliament; the United States by\r\nstanding Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, by\r\nwhom legislation is initiated, secretly formulated, and then carried\r\nthrough both Houses by aid of caucus management, and under the whip and\r\nspur of imperious majorities. This vast energy Mr. Seward now commanded\r\nthrough Speaker Banks in the House of Representatives. He had admirable\r\nlieutenants. Banks was a fair Speaker in his rulings, and not a sticker\r\nover non-essentials, but in everything that seriously affected the\r\nwelfare of the Republican party, he was an aggressive and tenacious\r\npartisan. The astute Thurlow Weed was even a shrewder politician\r\nthan Mr. Seward himself; and Horace Greeley, adopting the maxim of\r\nDaniel O’Connell—that agitation is the life of every cause—employed\r\nhis unrivaled editorial pen in the anti-slavery crusade, now fairly\r\ninaugurated throughout the Northern States. Yet with all his great\r\nadvantages and skill as an organizer, Mr. Seward could not have carried\r\nthe Republican party to victory, had not some of the leaders of the\r\nDemocratic party, during the last five years of their ascendency at\r\nWashington, wilfully neglected their opportunities, and given to their\r\nmore vigilant opponents the vantage ground in the collision of forces\r\non the floor of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter days of the Pierce administration, and the whole\r\nof that of Buchanan, measures of great national importance were\r\ndefeated through the culpable negligence of a few Southern Democrats.\r\nNorthern Representatives who stood by the South in defense of its\r\nconstitutional rights, bitterly complained of this neglect on the part\r\nof those who were so deeply interested. These Northern men, like Mr.\r\nKelly and Horace F. Clark, had to brave a false but growing public\r\nopinion at the North, on account of their heroic devotion to what they\r\ndeemed the line of duty, especially on the great Territorial questions,\r\nover which the Union was being shaken to its foundations. They had,\r\ntherefore, the right to expect corresponding earnestness on the part\r\nof all their fellow Democrats of the South. To hold to Jeffersonian,\r\nstrict construction opinions was then becoming extremely unpopular at\r\nthe North, and involved sacrifices that threatened to blight their\r\npolitical prospects. To maintain similar opinions at the South was a\r\nwholly different matter. Everybody there believed in the State-rights\r\ndoctrine, and public men were carried smoothly on with the current in\r\ndefending measures of administration.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly observed some things which he could not but regard with\r\npain during the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-fifth Congresses, for they\r\nwere pregnant with ill-omens for the country, and to a man of his\r\nperspicacious brain they must have foreboded those disasters to the\r\nDemocratic party which ere long overtook it. There was an incapacity\r\nfor affairs on the part of a few Southern Representatives, and a\r\nproneness to intemperance among quite a number of otherwise excellent\r\nmen from the same section. It was a bad symptom of the distempered\r\nstate of the Democratic party to find many of its Representatives\r\nfrequently, and inexcusably, absent from their seats when test votes\r\nwere about to be taken, fraught with vital interest to the South, and\r\ndecisive of great national policies. The fault was more grievous, when\r\nthe absentees, as was often the case, would have been able to change\r\nthe result by being present and voting. This was attributable in some\r\nmeasure to inexperience, and want of training for public life. Some\r\nthere were who were addicted to pleasure parties, frequently went home\r\nto their families, and entertained fanciful ideas respecting the duties\r\ndevolving on gentlemen in society. That they were honorable men who\r\nwould not stoop to disreputable conduct, no one who knew them can for\r\na moment doubt. Indeed their integrity bore refreshing contrast to\r\nthe looser morality so often to be encountered in a later political\r\ngeneration. The trouble simply was that these men were impracticables,\r\nand out of place in the Halls of Congress during the stormy days of\r\n1855-60. They talked politics in the parlor and bar-room, and neglected\r\ntheir duties in the House and Senate. John Randolph, in his Hudibrastic\r\nvein, scores a similar class that flourished in Virginia in 1831: “We\r\nhug our lousy cloaks around us, take another _chaw of tubbacker_,\r\nfloat the room with nastiness, or ruin the grate and fire-irons, where\r\nthey happen not to be rusty, and try conclusions upon constitutional\r\npoints.”[31]\r\n\r\nBut a still greater evil was intemperance. The Hole-in-the-Wall, in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, was the downward path to irretrievable ruin,\r\nwhere many a noble fellow of genius and promise drowned his faculties\r\nin rum, when his country most needed his services. While the Democrats\r\nand Republicans were in a deadly struggle on the floor of the House\r\nover questions involving the destinies of the Union, and the lives and\r\nfortunes of millions of human beings, the tipplers were in the bar-room\r\ndrinking, or on the sofas of the lobby dozing in their cups. A vote\r\nis wanting to carry an imperiled measure to victory,—the inebriate is\r\nlifted into a sitting posture, dragged to the floor, and bid to vote\r\naye, or no, provided he is there to mumble out the word. Too often\r\nhe is absent, having been carried off to his lodgings in a state of\r\ndrunken imbecility. John Quincy Adams[32], in his Memoirs, inveighs\r\nsavagely against this melancholy vice, as the besetting sin of an\r\nearlier day; and Alexander H. Stephens, in his private letters to his\r\nbrother, Judge Linton Stephens, pours out indignant lamentations over\r\nthe same disgraceful spectacle at the period under review.\r\n\r\n“One vote against us,” writes Mr. Stephens to his brother, August 23,\r\n1856, on the loss of an important bill. “Seven more Southern men absent\r\nthan Northern. If our men had stayed, we should have been triumphant\r\nto-day. On several votes we lost two to three Southern men who were\r\ntoo drunk to be brought in.”[33] Again, February 5, 1858, he says: “I\r\nhave been more provoked at the course of Southern men on this Kansas\r\nquestion from the beginning than upon any other subject in my public\r\ncareer. I mean their culpable negligence.”[34] He informs his brother\r\nthat thirteen Southern Democrats were absent March 11, 1858, when an\r\nimportant vote was taken, and the Republicans prevailed. “Had the\r\nthirteen been present we should have saved the question. How shamefully\r\nthe South is represented! Some of the Southern men were too drunk to\r\nbe got into the House. * * Have we any future but miserable petty\r\nsquabbles, parties, factions, and fragments of organizations, led on by\r\ncontemptible drunken demagogues?”[35]\r\n\r\nThe next day he writes again: “As usual we lost the question by the\r\nabsence of two Southern votes. Luck seems to be against us. We had all\r\nour other men there to-day except those paired. Some were so drunk they\r\nhad to be kept out until they were wanted to say ‘aye,’ or ‘no,’ as the\r\ncase might be.”[36] Two years later, after the celebrated Charleston\r\nDemocratic National Convention had broken up in a row, and the Douglas\r\nwing had adjourned to meet in Baltimore, and the Breckenridge wing in\r\nRichmond, Mr. Stephens seems to hint that drunkenness had something to\r\ndo with that most fatal step the Democrats ever took. “I am sorry,”\r\nhe says in a letter to Professor Johnston, “things are as they are;\r\nsorry as I should be to see the paroxyms of a dear friend in a fit of\r\ndelirium tremens.”[37] Mr. Kelly, who was a delegate to the Charleston\r\nConvention, returned home mortified and sad. “The drunkenness down\r\nthere,” said he to the author of this memoir, “was shameful. Men whose\r\nminds are inflamed with whiskey are not able to govern themselves, much\r\nless the country. Alas! for the poor Democratic party. The disruption\r\nmeans defeat, and unless the Douglas men and Anti-Douglas men come\r\ntogether and nominate a single ticket, the Republicans will carry the\r\nelection.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly, during his two terms in Congress, witnessed the demoralizing\r\nscenes to which Mr. Stephens refers in his letters. Kelly was often\r\namused in spite of himself when he went out to the lobby to shake up\r\nsome poor inebriated gentleman, and lead him to the floor to give an\r\nimportant vote. The grotesqueness and difficulties of the task, and the\r\nabsurd figure cut by the tipsy Solon, always excited his risibilities,\r\nalthough he tried to keep a straight face during the trip to and fro.\r\nHis account of some of these scenes, never mentioned except among\r\nintimate friends, was rich in comic touches and facial contortions. His\r\nmimicry of the scenes was irresistible. But he, too, equally with Mr.\r\nStephens, saw what it would all lead to, and felt that the Democratic\r\nparty was in a bad way.\r\n\r\nAnother element of Democratic weakness was the over-readiness of those\r\ncalled Fire-eaters to appeal to the code duello, or other forms of\r\npersonal rencontre. This was made by an unfriendly press to bear the\r\nappearance of a species of terrorism, and was to some extent a revival\r\nof the bullying and domineering so common among the Federalists in\r\nCongress in their treatment of Democrats during the Administration\r\nof John Adams. Writing in 1809 of “the brow-beatings and insults,”\r\nto which the Federalists subjected the Democrats in the days of the\r\nelder Adams, Mr. Jefferson says: “No person who was not a witness of\r\nthe scenes of that gloomy period can form any idea of the afflicting\r\npersecutions and personal indignities we had to brook. They saved our\r\ncountry, however.”[38] The inexcusable assault of Preston S. Brooks on\r\nCharles Sumner in the Senate Chamber, May 22, 1856, had had its exact\r\ncounterpart on the floor of the House of Representatives, February 15,\r\n1798, when Roger Griswold, a member of Congress from Connecticut, with\r\na stout hickory club, made a furious assault during the sitting of the\r\nHouse upon the celebrated Matthew Lyon, one of the Representatives from\r\nVermont. Griswold was a Federalist, and Lyon a Democrat. But in the\r\nlatter case the assault was made by Brooks, a Democrat, upon Sumner,\r\na Republican. The Federalists condoned the offense of Griswold, and by\r\nthe decisive majority of 73 to 21 refused to expel him from Congress.\r\nEven a resolution to censure him was lost.[39] The Republicans of 1856,\r\npolitical legatees of the Federalists of 1798, did not show the same\r\nforbearance in the case of Brooks. A resolution of expulsions received\r\n121 affirmative, and 94 negative votes in the House, not enough to\r\nexpel a member under the two-thirds rule required by the Constitution,\r\nbut more than enough, remembering the palliation of Griswold’s offense,\r\nto prove that all such votes reflect the partisan prejudices rather\r\nthan the impartial judgment of members.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 a scuffle took place upon the floor of Congress between\r\nMr. John Sherman of Ohio, and Mr. Wright of Tennessee. Mr. Sherman\r\nattempted to throw a handful of wafers in Mr. Wright’s face, and the\r\nlatter returned the compliment by aiming a blow at Sherman with his\r\nfist. The latter put his hand in his pistol-pocket, but before he could\r\ndraw members rushed between the combatants, and separated them.[40]\r\nIntense excitement prevailed during this bear-garden performance.\r\n\r\nA still more disgraceful scene occurred in the House, February 5, 1858.\r\nMr. Grow of Pennsylvania, and Mr. Keitt of South Carolina became\r\nengaged in a regular fist fight, which spread to others until the\r\nflourishing conflict boasted not less than thirty active participants.\r\nThe fight took place directly in front of the Clerk’s desk. In the\r\nmidst of the melee Mr. Barksdale, who afterwards fell in the battle\r\nof Gettysburgh, rushed at Mr. Covode of Pennsylvania, who had lifted\r\nup a heavy spittoon and was about to hurl it at the head of the\r\nMississippian, but at that instant some one seized Barksdale by the\r\nhead, and off came his wig, leaving his shining pate glittering in\r\nthe gas light, perfectly bald. At this ludicrous vision the enraged\r\ncombatants and all the spectators were moved to laughter, and finally\r\nMr. Speaker was able, by aid of the Sergeant-at-Arms, who bore his mace\r\non high and led his posse through the throng, to recall the House, if\r\nnot to order, at least from pandemonium.\r\n\r\n“Last night,” says Mr. Stephens, in a letter, February 5, 1858, “we\r\nhad a battle royal in the House. Thirty men at least were engaged in\r\nthe fisticuff. Fortunately, no weapons were used. It was the first\r\nsectional fight ever had on the floor, I think; and if any weapons had\r\nbeen on hand it would probably have been a bloody one. All things here\r\nare tending to bring my mind to the conclusion that the Union cannot,\r\nor will not last long.”[41]\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly in the midst of these belligerent and disgraceful scenes\r\nkept cool and calm. Once, however, Mr. Humphrey Marshall, the Kentucky\r\nKnow-Nothing, provoked him into momentary indignation by an insulting\r\nallusion to Mr. Kelly’s religion, and by charging Catholics with abject\r\nservitude in all civil and religious matters to the will of a foreign\r\nprince, the Pope of Rome. Kelly rose and corrected Marshall without\r\ndiscourtesy or bad feeling, but the huge form of the Kentuckian dilated\r\nwith rage, and he repeated the offensive charge in still stronger\r\nlanguage. Then Kelly rose with fire in his eye, and hurled back the\r\ncharge in such manner as to satisfy the whole House, and Marshall\r\nin particular, that the barbaric passion for war, however held in\r\nsubjection at other times, now glowed in the bosom of the New York\r\nmember with irresistible fierceness. The two gentleman sat near each\r\nother, and the scene as described to the author of this memoir by a\r\nmember who occupied an intervening seat, Judge Augustus R. Wright of\r\nGeorgia, must have produced intense excitement throughout the House.\r\nJudge Wright, a distinguished Southern lawyer, said that after the\r\ncolloquy between Mr. Kelly and Mr. Marshall, which is imperfectly\r\nreported in the Globe, and after Mr. Marshall had concluded his speech,\r\nthe latter walked over to Mr. Kelly’s seat, and demanded to know what\r\nhe meant by declaring the statement he had made was false. Marshall was\r\nknown to be a believer in the code duello, and was a man of immense\r\nsize. Mr. Kelly kept his eyes fixed on Mr. Marshall as he approached,\r\nand Mr. Wright said that his physiognomy would have been a study for\r\nLavater. It was rigid and intent, but the eyes kindled with peculiar\r\nlight, and he gave Marshall such a glance that he, Wright, never could\r\nforget it as long as he lived, and he supposed Marshall never would\r\neither. To the question Kelly replied: “I meant exactly what I said;\r\nyour statement was not true, Sir.” Mr. Kelly was on his feet facing Mr.\r\nMarshall, and Judge Wright anticipated an immediate collision between\r\nthem. It was avoided, however, and Marshall, with returning good humor,\r\nmade some allusion to the plain modes of speech in vogue among New York\r\nmembers, and went back to his place.—The colloquy as published in the\r\nGlobe, toned down considerably in asperity, is as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall. “I feel quite sure there should have been a distinction\r\ndrawn between the Papist and the Catholic. I understand that a portion\r\nof the Catholics hold the doctrine that the Pope,—whether it springs\r\nfrom his spiritual power or his temporal power, or both combined, is\r\nin the last resort the ultimate judge, not only of moral right, but\r\nunder the moral law, of political right; and, therefore, possesses the\r\npower in some way, to absolve the citizen from obedience to the law of\r\nthe land or country to which he belongs, of which his Holiness may\r\ndisapprove as an infraction of the Divine law.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly. “I desire to ask the gentleman a question.”\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall. “The gentleman can take an hour to reply to my speech.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly. “The gentleman asserts what is not a fact, and I desire”—\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall. “I have found a great contrariety of opinions among\r\nCatholics upon this particular branch of my subject, and I do not\r\nexpect that my friend from New York and I shall agree upon what are the\r\nfacts in regard to it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly. “I deny that they hold any such doctrine, and the gentleman\r\nstates what is not true.”\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall. “Well, I must say that the gentleman puts his remarks in\r\na very blunt form.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly. “I say that the statement is not true.”\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall. “Why surely one branch of the Church holds that doctrine.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly. “I say there is no branch in this country that holds that\r\ndoctrine; and the gentleman has never seen one that advocates that\r\ndoctrine.”[42]\r\n\r\nMr. Marshall reiterated the statement, and Mr. Kelly in still more\r\npositive language denounced it as untrue, and challenged the\r\nKentuckian to produce any evidence to sustain his allegation. The scene\r\nwas becoming very animated, and as the two herculean Representatives\r\nglared at each other with angry mien and menacing front, Mr. Wright was\r\nreminded, as he afterwards said, of Milton’s picture:—\r\n\r\n                                       “Such a frown\r\n    Each cast at the other, as when two black clouds\r\n    With heaven’s artillery fraught, come rattling on\r\n    Over the Caspian, then stand front to front\r\n    Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow\r\n    To join their dark encounter in mid-air\r\n    So frowned the mighty combatants.”\r\n\r\nBut this dispute with Marshall was a very exceptional thing to happen\r\nto Mr. Kelly. He was a universal favorite in both Houses of Congress,\r\nand his popularity continued to grow the longer he remained at the\r\nFederal Capital. Some rare men there are in this world in whom there\r\nis such unity of character, whose talents however high are equalled by\r\nthe qualities of their hearts; whose virtues however great are equalled\r\nby the warmth of their affections and the sweetness of their temper;\r\nthey carry a passport to the common heart written, as it were, upon\r\ntheir fronts by the finger of God. “The world is a looking-glass,” says\r\nThackeray in Vanity Fair, “and gives back to every man the reflection\r\nof his own face. Frown at it, and it will in turn look sourly upon\r\nyou; laugh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion.” Sir\r\nThomas More was one of those rare characters who won the general heart\r\nby the sunshine that played about him. He met Erasmus at a dinner table\r\nin London without an introduction, but Erasmus knew him at once. “Aut\r\nMorus aut Nullus,” said he. “Aut Erasmus aut Diabolus,” was the waggish\r\nreply. In America occasionally some noble spirit appears who finds his\r\nway to all hearts without an effort. Such a man was Nathaniel Macon of\r\nNorth Carolina, simple, plain, unostentatious, the political idol of\r\nJohn Randolph, “the last of the Romans” as Jefferson called him; “a\r\nspeaker,” says Benton, “of no pretension and great performance, who\r\nspoke more good sense while he was getting up out of his chair and\r\ngetting back into it, than many others did in long discourses.”[43]\r\nMr. Stephens frequently said to the present writer that John Kelly\r\nreminded him more of Nathaniel Macon than did any other man in public\r\nlife. Kelly’s rugged sense of right, his blunt honesty, sagaciousness,\r\nmodesty, and good humor, conspired to make friends for him on all sides\r\nof the House. If he was asked to do a favor for any one, he generally\r\ndid more than was asked, and never said anything about it afterwards.\r\nKindness and service to mankind were virtues of which he was the\r\ncheerful exemplar.\r\n\r\nStephens and Kelly were strikingly alike in this respect, both seemed\r\nnever to tire in well-doing and deeds of benevolence. The number of\r\npoor boys who have owed their education and success in life to these\r\ntwo men has been very large. There are hundreds of happy homes in\r\nthis country to-day where poverty has been turned into comfort, and\r\npinching want into comparative prosperity, by Alexander H. Stephens and\r\nJohn Kelly. The two gentlemen were deeply attached friends, and each\r\nregarded the other as the type of an honest statesman. Twenty years\r\nafter the close of their Congressional relations, Mr. Stephens, in a\r\nletter to the present writer, desired to be remembered to Mr. Kelly in\r\nthe kindest manner. The following is the letter, personal matters of no\r\ninterest to the general reader being omitted:\r\n\r\n  LIBERTY HALL,\r\n  Crawfordsville, Georgia,\r\n  28th October, 1878.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n Your letter was duly received. Two days afterwards the parcel came. *\r\n * *\r\n\r\n I am now just about leaving home for an absence of several days. I\r\n want you to read Johnston and Browne’s recent book. I have ordered\r\n several copies, but none has yet reached here, or I would send you\r\n one. Give John Kelly my kindest regards when you see him. I regard him\r\n as one of the ablest and truest men in this country. * * *\r\n\r\n With best wishes to you and all yours, I remain,\r\n\r\n  Very truly,\r\n\r\n  ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s esteem for Mr. Stephens while living, and his respect for\r\nthe great Commoner’s memory when dead, are shown by the subjoined\r\nextract from an article which appeared in the New York Utica Observer,\r\nNovember 22, 1884:\r\n\r\n“William M. Evarts, Republican, and John Kelly, Democrat, have each\r\ncontributed fifty dollars to the Alexander H. Stephens Memorial Fund.\r\nJohn Kelly wrote as follows to the Committee: ‘I had the honor of\r\nsitting in Congress with this gentleman thirty years ago, and always\r\nentertained for him the highest regard. He was a noble example of a\r\nstatesman; in fact, I never met a man who was so pure in his intentions\r\nin public life.’ Commenting upon this circumstance, the Atlanta\r\n_Constitution_ says: ‘It is a good sign of the proper feeling between\r\nthe South and North to see such men as W.M. Evarts and John Kelly\r\njoining in doing honor to the memory of the ex-Vice-President of the\r\nConfederacy.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Life of A. H. Stephens.

KELLY IN VARIOUS DEBATES—FAMINE IN THE CAPE DE VERDE\r\n ISLANDS—“IRISH WAITERS”—MAYNARD’S SNEER AND KELLY’S\r\n REBUKE—KNOW-NOTHING RIOT IN WASHINGTON—KELLY WITNESSES THE SCENE—HIS\r\n GREAT HOMESTEAD SPEECH—OTHER SPEECHES BY HIM—WASHINGTON SOCIETY IN THE\r\n OLDEN DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a comprehensive portrayal, rather than biography in detail, is the\r\ndesign of this volume, a general survey of Mr. Kelly’s Congressional\r\ncareer is all that can be attempted in these pages, with concise\r\nmention of some of its leading events and incidents. His speeches alone\r\nwould fill a book of equal size to this.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a debate in the Committee of the whole on the State\r\nof the Union, May 26, 1856, Mr. Kelly delivered a strong speech upon\r\nNew York politics, in which he gave an interesting review of the\r\ndivisions that had prevailed in the Democratic party of that State.\r\nTracing back those divisions to 1848, he gave a lucid insight into\r\nthe history of the Hunkers and Barnburners, and of the later factions\r\nknown as Hard Shells and Soft Shells. He evinced thorough acquaintance\r\nwith the complexional differences between those factions, and with\r\nthe political history of the Empire State, a knowledge which was\r\nto prove so useful to him in after years. He charged that many of\r\nthe Hards were Know-Nothings, but attributed patriotic motives to\r\nother members of that wing of the party. He might have made the same\r\ncharge of Know-Nothingism with equal justice against many of the\r\nSofts. Subsequent history probably has led Mr. Kelly to modify some\r\nof the opinions he expressed in that speech. There were good National\r\nDemocrats in both wings of the party, the disturbing question of\r\nslavery being the chief cause of dissension. The anti-slavery agitation\r\nat the North, and consequent dissemination at the South of the old\r\nNew England doctrine of secession, were the two growing ideas, the\r\nmonomania of that age of American history. The Republican party was\r\nmore largely recruited from the ranks of the Soft Shells than from\r\nthose of the Hard Shells, and the resolutions and speeches in the\r\nSyracuse Soft Convention of 1855, of which Mr. Kelly was a member, and\r\nwhich were discussed at large in a former chapter, clearly indicated\r\nthat such would be the case.\r\n\r\nAs sound a Democrat as President Pierce was, he made the mistake of\r\nplacing the chief control of his Administration in the hands of those\r\nDemocrats, both at the North and South, who had opposed the compromise\r\nof 1850, such as John A. Dix and John Van Buren on the one hand, and\r\nJefferson Davis on the other.\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding,” said Mr. Kelly, “the outcry raised by our enemies,\r\nwho desire to destroy the influence of New York, let me assure you,\r\nMr. Chairman, that there now exists no division among the Democratic\r\nmasses there. They now happily constitute a united party, bound\r\ntogether by a common creed and a common interest. This union of the\r\nHunker and Barnburner sections of the party was accomplished in 1849,\r\nthe year after the unfortunate defeat of General Cass, and it has gone\r\non strengthening ever since, in spite of the transient fanaticisms of\r\nRepublicanism and Know-Nothingism, from one or the other of which the\r\nparty in every section of the country has suffered temporary damage,\r\nour late reverses in New York forming no exception to the general rule.\r\nIf the Democrats of Louisiana, or Tennessee, or of any other Southern\r\nStates, have been prostrated when opposed to only one of these evils,\r\nis it a peculiar disgrace—is it any special evidence of impotency, that\r\nwe have had to yield once or twice before the combined forces of both?”\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1855 the crops in Europe and other parts of the world\r\nsuffered greatly from unseasonable and excessive rains. In some\r\nplaces, particularly in the Cape de Verde Islands, the wet weather was\r\nsucceeded by a protracted drought. For two years prior to that year the\r\nCape de Verdes had suffered from a scarcity of food owing to similar\r\ncauses, and a third visitation now reduced the inhabitants in many\r\nplaces to a state of starvation. The Bishop of those islands on the\r\n12th of March, 1856, wrote an earnest appeal for succor to Archbishop\r\nHughes, of New York. “Having exhausted all our own means,” said he, “it\r\nonly remains for us to appeal to the charity of the public. If these\r\npeople are not promptly succored more than twenty thousand persons\r\nwill perish, victims of famine.” A movement was organized in New\r\nYork to send food to the famine-stricken islanders, and a resolution\r\nwas introduced in Congress by Mr. Wheeler, of New York, in which the\r\nPresident was requested to instruct the Secretary of the Navy to detail\r\ntwenty-five seamen to man the vessel in which the cargo of food was\r\nto be shipped to the sufferers. Archbishop Hughes had confided Bishop\r\nPatricio’s appeal to Mr. Kelly, and requested him to lay it before\r\nCongress, and use his best offices with his fellow-members to secure\r\nfavorable action upon it. On the 19th of May, Mr. Kelly asked and\r\nobtained the unanimous consent of the House, after the introduction of\r\nMr. Wheeler’s resolution, to have the letter to Archbishop Hughes read.\r\nThe picture which the Bishop of the Cape de Verde Islands had drawn of\r\nthe dreadful scourge deeply impressed members. In the course of the\r\ndebate some objections were made to the passage of the resolution, to\r\nwhich Mr. Kelly replied as follows:\r\n\r\n“This resolution, Mr. Speaker, merely proposes to relieve the poor\r\npeople in those islands, who are now in a state of starvation on\r\naccount of the blight to their vine crop; and it is astonishing to me\r\nthat any member of this House should object to a resolution of this\r\nkind. It asks no appropriation of money; it does not ask Congress\r\nto appropriate a single dollar towards relieving them. The generous\r\ncitizens of New York have come forward and held a meeting at the\r\nExchange in that city, and agreed to load a vessel with provisions for\r\nthe use of these destitute people of the Cape de Verdes, who are now\r\nliving on the bark of trees, the stalks of bananas, and anything else\r\nthey can pick up to save themselves from utter starvation. Therefore,\r\nI trust that there will be no objection from any gentleman in this\r\nHouse to the resolution presented by my colleague. It merely asks that\r\na crew of United States seamen may be given to navigate the vessel, in\r\norder that relief may reach those poor people in time to save them from\r\nimpending destruction. It is not much that is asked, and we ought, I\r\nthink, cheerfully to grant it.”\r\n\r\nThis simple, strong appeal proved effective, and the resolution was\r\npassed by the large vote of 123 ayes to 24 noes.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly was again nominated for Congress in 1856, and at the election\r\non November 4th of that year was returned to the Thirty-fifth Congress\r\nby an overwhelming majority. Of the 11,599 votes cast in the Fourth\r\nCongressional District of New York, John Kelly received 8,319, L. W.\r\nRyckman, 1,497; W. F. Gould, 1,735, and 48 were scattering. Kelly’s\r\nmajority over all was 5,039.\r\n\r\nDuring Mr. Kelly’s second term in Congress a savage riot occurred in\r\nWashington at the District election in June, 1857. For some time the\r\ncity was at the mercy of a gang of professional desperadoes, composed\r\nof Washington Know-Nothings, and Plug Uglies of the same party from\r\nBaltimore, the latter being the pets and followers of the malignant\r\nHenry Winter Davis. The Mayor was powerless to preserve the peace with\r\nthe insufficient police force at his command, and President Buchanan,\r\non the Mayor’s requisition, called out the Marines at the Navy Yard\r\nunder Major Tyler to disperse the rioters. The military proceeded\r\nto the Northern Liberties, where they were attacked by the mob,\r\nand several innocent citizens were killed. Major Tyler was finally\r\ncompelled to return the fire of the infuriated mob, and for some time\r\nthat portion of the city was the scene of a fierce battle. It was not\r\nuntil the fire of the soldiers was directed in a few cases with fatal\r\neffect that the miscreants were driven off and dispersed.\r\n\r\nAfter the disturbance, the Mayor of the city and the Chief of the\r\nWashington police, feeling themselves unable to cope with the lawless\r\nbands in their midst, appealed to Congress for relief. A bill to\r\nestablish an Auxiliary Guard for the protection of public and private\r\nproperty in the city of Washington was accordingly introduced in the\r\nSenate, and after an extended debate the excellent measure passed\r\nthat body, and was sent to the House of Representatives for action\r\nthere. The remedies applied in the city of Baltimore, where still\r\nmore atrocious scenes of bloodshed annually had occurred under Mayor\r\nSwan’s Know-Nothing administration, with Henry Winter Davis firing\r\nthe hearts of his Plug Uglies to a war of extermination against\r\nforeigners, presented an example to Washington of the effective way\r\nof redeeming the latter city from the scoundrels who infested it.\r\nThe Legislature of Maryland took the control of the police force of\r\nBaltimore from the Mayor, and lodged it in the hands of an independent\r\nofficer known as Marshal of Police. In the bill creating the office\r\nthe celebrated George P. Kane was designated as Marshal, and no\r\nbetter man ever lived for a position of that kind. Col. Kane was a\r\ngentleman by instinct and education; the purity of his character was\r\nuniversally recognized, and the intrepidity of his nature was perfectly\r\nunderstood by the law-breakers of Baltimore. A man of gigantic stature,\r\nhe possessed wonderful symmetry and comeliness of person, enormous\r\nphysical strength, and a courage that would have carried him to the\r\nstake to be flayed alive in vindication of an idea or principle he\r\nbelieved to be right. This man did more to redeem Baltimore from the\r\nassassins and ruffians who had controlled it than all other men and\r\nagencies combined. Under Marshal Kane’s magnificent administration the\r\nMonumental City became one of the most peaceable, as it long had been\r\none of the most beautiful of American cities. In after years the people\r\nrewarded this destroyer of Know-Nothingism in their midst, first with\r\nthe office of High Sheriff, and next with that of Mayor of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe bill to establish an Auxiliary Guard in Washington, whose features\r\nresembled those of the Maryland Act creating a Marshal of Police in the\r\ncity of Baltimore, received Mr. Kelly’s decided approval and support\r\nwhen it reached the House. In the course of the debate on this bill,\r\nApril 15, 1858, Mr. Kelly said:\r\n\r\n“The proposition before the Committee is that the police laws of this\r\ncity are of such a character that the citizens of Washington have to\r\nask Congress to alter them in order to protect them from the murderer\r\nand assassin. The bill proposes to give to the President of the United\r\nStates the power to appoint the Chief of Police, and that that Chief\r\nof Police, with the consent of the Secretary of the Interior, shall\r\nhave the power to appoint his subordinate officers. The people here\r\nare willing to throw up their charter, given to them by Congress, for\r\nthe reason, as they say, that they are not able to protect themselves\r\nagainst the criminals that infest the city. The amendment proposed\r\nby the gentleman from New York (Mr. Dodd) providing for the selection\r\nof Commissioners by the people is, in my opinion, objectionable.\r\nMen elected as Americans will, of course, appoint Americans or\r\nKnow-Nothings to office, and _vice versa_, Democrats will do the same\r\nthing. The only way to give this city an efficient police is by passing\r\nthe bill reported by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goode), placing\r\nthe power in the hands of the President of the United States to appoint\r\nthe Chief of Police. Mr. Chairman, in the various arguments that have\r\nbeen made on this bill, all kinds of logic have been brought to bear\r\nin favor of gentlemen’s different prejudices. The gentleman from\r\nTennessee (Mr. Maynard), in discussing this bill yesterday, referred to\r\na transaction which took place during a former Congress.[44] He spoke\r\nof men who earn their living by the sweat of their brow as a ‘parcel\r\nof Irish waiters.’ Now, sir, I do not think that that expression\r\nwas called for. These men, whether Irish or German, or belonging to\r\nany other country, have the same rights under the Constitution as\r\nAmerican-born citizens. It is not to be said that because these men\r\nwere waiters, they had not their independent rights and privileges as\r\nmuch as the Representatives of the people on this floor. I tell the\r\ngentleman from Tennessee, and other members of this House, that the\r\nhumble Irishman has his rights under the Constitution, naturalized as\r\nhe is by your laws, equally with the native-born, and until he commits\r\nsome act in derogation of the true principles of manhood, it does\r\nnot become any gentleman to stigmatize him or speak of him in such a\r\ncontemptuous style.\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stanton), in speaking on this Bill,\r\nattributes the defeat in 1844 of that great and honored statesman, Mr.\r\nClay, who has long since gone to his grave, to the Empire Club in the\r\ncity of New York, and to the manner in which the election was conducted\r\nin that city. Let me tell the gentleman that I was conversant with\r\nall those facts, and knew of the transactions which took place in New\r\nYork in 1844. There was another Club there at that time, and it was a\r\nvery objectionable one, because all the pugilists, all the fighters,\r\nand all the rowdies you could find, were brought together by pay,\r\nby solicitations of whatever nature, and were formed into a Club in\r\nopposition to the Empire Club at that time. Now, I ask the gentleman if\r\nhe knows who was president of that Club?”\r\n\r\nMr. Stanton: “I know nothing in regard to that Club. Who was the man?”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “Bill Poole. I am sorry to say he got into a personal\r\ndifficulty in New York and was killed. Let me say to the gentleman\r\nthat when both of those Clubs were organized at that particular time,\r\nthough there were violent men in both, neither one of these Clubs used\r\nviolence against citizens in going to the polls to exercise the right\r\nof suffrage. That cannot be said in this city, for I am reminded of the\r\ntransactions which took place at the election here last June.”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from Mississippi, (Mr. Quitman,) said, in his speech,\r\nthat there was no violence in this city; that he had travelled around\r\non frequent occasions, in order to see if some one of the rowdies here\r\nwould not attack him. Now I know that the gentleman has displayed\r\ncourage upon the battle-field, and rendered essential service to his\r\ncountry. No man doubts his integrity, his honesty and his bravery; but\r\nhad he been here last June, he would have met in the streets of this\r\ncity that which no man desires to meet. I saw a body of young men from\r\neighteen to twenty years of age, driving men of thirty and forty years\r\nof age before them like sheep from the field, and firing their pistols\r\namong them indiscriminately. Yet there did not appear to be, so far as\r\nI could see, courage enough in the citizens of this city to resent the\r\noutrage which was perpetrated upon them at that time.\r\n\r\n“Crime, Mr. Chairman, in all cities, whether it be here, or in New\r\nYork, or elsewhere, unless checked by the physical power of man, will\r\ncontinually manifest itself. Some gentlemen here have argued that you\r\ncannot check it by physical force; that moral force must be resorted\r\nto. That is all humbug, for such a check amounts to nothing at all.\r\nViolence of all description will be committed, unless you have proper\r\nofficers to prevent it. Then you ought in the present case to organize\r\na police force to meet this exigency, and to arrest the individuals\r\nwho are in the habit of committing crimes in your city. Now this bill\r\norganizes an efficient police, under the jurisdiction of officers of\r\nthis Government who have the full control of it,—a force which will be\r\nthe means of protecting individuals who come here to transact business,\r\nas well as yourselves, for many of you admit that it is dangerous to\r\nleave your rooms at night,—that you are afraid of encountering these\r\nmarauders who infest the city. The main objection on the other side\r\nof the House is that the Chief of Police, who may be appointed by\r\nthe President, will be partial in his appointments, selecting only\r\npartisans, or those who favor his political principles, just as it\r\nis supposed the President himself will appoint a man who is of his\r\npolitics. That argument, in my opinion, cannot hold good. I do not\r\nthink such a course will be carried out, and I know if I had anything\r\nto do with it, I would not be partial at all. I would select men for\r\ntheir character alone. If I saw they were efficient, physically able\r\nto do the duties of policemen, and of good moral character, I would\r\nappoint them upon such grounds alone, without regard to politics. But,\r\ngentlemen on the other side say they are afraid to trust the President.\r\nWell, we are afraid to trust them in the city of New York. The case\r\nof this city and that of New York, between which some analogies have\r\nbeen made, are not parallel cases at all. This city is under the\r\njurisdiction of the Federal Government. The President and the Congress\r\nof the United States are here; Ministers from foreign Governments are\r\nhere; and the courts here are under the jurisdiction of the Federal\r\nGovernment. The only difference between the appointment of a Chief of\r\nPolice by the President and by the Mayor is this: in the former case\r\nthe Chief of Police is responsible to the Federal Government, and if he\r\ndoes not carry out the laws, can easily be reached; while on the other\r\nhand if the Mayor does not appoint satisfactorily, the people cannot\r\nreach his appointee, in the same manner.”[45]\r\n\r\nThe Republicans and Know-Nothings were strong enough, with the aid of\r\na few Democrats, who had fine-spun constitutional objections to it,\r\nto prevent the passage of this excellent bill by the House, but Mr.\r\nKelly’s argument was not successfully answered by any of the opponents\r\nof the measure.\r\n\r\nAn interesting debate took place in the House, May 3, 1858, in relation\r\nto the Bureau of Statistics of the State Department, in which Mr. Kelly\r\ntook a prominent part. This Bureau was established by Congress upon\r\nthe recommendation of Mr. Marcy during the last Administration. The\r\nurgent necessity for such a Bureau was originally pointed out by Mr.\r\nWebster in 1842, when he was at the head of the Department. Several\r\nvolumes upon the Commercial Relations of the United States with all\r\nother countries were issued during 1856 and 1857, prepared ostensibly\r\nby Edmund Flagg, Superintendent of the Bureau, but in reality Flagg\r\nhad very little to do with the work. Hugh C. McLaughlin of Virginia,\r\nMr. Flagg’s assistant, and who was soon after appointed his successor\r\nas Superintendent, was the real compiler, translator and editor of\r\nthe valuable materials contained in those volumes. But Flagg was\r\nSuperintendent, and he not only contrived to get his name printed on\r\nthe title page as such, but to monopolise the whole credit to himself\r\nfor the work. The volumes were received with remarkable favor by the\r\nleading commercial authorities in this country and Europe. Hunt’s\r\nMerchants Magazine spoke highly of them. In a notice of the fourth\r\nvolume, the London Athenæum of February 20, 1858, said: “The highest\r\npraise is due to the House of Representatives for publishing this\r\ncomprehensive and really national report, which brings into one view\r\nthe commercial status of the United States with the entire world.”[46]\r\nThe celebrated M. Rouher, then Minister of Agriculture and Commerce\r\nin France, who subsequently figured so conspicuously under the Empire\r\nof Napoleon the Third, expressed unqualified praise of this work of\r\nthe State Department at Washington. To a friend who sent him one of\r\nthe volumes, M. Rouher wrote: “This document is executed under the\r\ndirection of the Secretary of State, by Mr. Edmund Flagg, an officer\r\nof the State Department. The Minister of France at Washington had\r\nalready communicated to the Imperial Government the remarkable Report\r\nof Mr. Flagg to Mr. Marcy. It contains abundant and useful information;\r\nand I am happy to recognize in it marked improvement over works of\r\nthe same character previously published by the American Government. A\r\nfurther improvement will be accomplished when, in accordance with the\r\nwish of Mr. Flagg, Congress shall prescribe a continuous, periodical\r\nand practically useful publication, like that which my Department has\r\nconstantly issued for many years.”[47]\r\n\r\nIf M. Rouher was in the habit of following the proceedings of the\r\nAmerican Congress, his surprise must have been great to find this\r\nsame Mr. Flagg, who but a few months before had expressed so earnest\r\na desire for the continued and regular publication of the Commercial\r\nRelations by the State Department, now haunting the lobbies of\r\nCongress, and supplying specious arguments to the opposition or\r\nRepublican members against the further publication of the work, and in\r\nfavor of the abolition of the Bureau itself. That which he proclaimed\r\na work of national importance yesterday, he declared to be a useless\r\nencumbrance to-day. Flagg’s sudden change of mind was easily explained.\r\nCertain irregularities in his accounts had been discovered, and\r\nSecretary Cass had compelled him to send in his resignation. _Hinc\r\nillae lachrymæ._ The opposition members were always ready to attack\r\nthe Administration, and Mr. Flagg plied them with frivolous arguments\r\nagainst the Bureau from which he had been discharged. Mr. Nichols\r\nof Ohio, and Mr. Washburne of Illinois, two Republican Congressmen,\r\nperhaps unaware that Flagg was a man with a grievance, espoused his\r\ncause, and while the Appropriation Bill for the legislative, executive\r\nand judicial branches of the Government was under consideration, May\r\n3, 1858, they declared that it would be a waste of money to make any\r\nappropriation for the Bureau of Statistics in the State Department,\r\nand Mr. Nichols made this a pretext to denounce the extravagance of\r\nthe Administration. After he had made his attack, and elicited no\r\nreply, Mr. Nichols was emboldened to go farther, and indiscreetly\r\nbegan to cross-question the members of the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, of which Mr. Kelly was one, and by which the Appropriation Bill\r\nhad been brought in, and to extol Flagg as a disinterested patriot,\r\nwho had resigned his office, because he could not conscientiously\r\ndraw a salary for work that was wholly useless. This was a fatal line\r\nof attack for Nichols to pursue, as he soon discovered to his cost.\r\nSenator Clay of Alabama, Chairman of the Committee on Commerce in the\r\nSenate, had investigated Flagg’s case in the State Department, and Mr.\r\nKelly afterwards had become acquainted with the doings of the latter\r\nindividual. Challenged to defend the appropriation, Mr. J. Glancy\r\nJones, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, and Mr. Kelly, a\r\nmember of the same Committee, completely turned the tables upon Mr.\r\nNichols and Mr. Washburne and after Kelly’s crushing rejoinder, Mr.\r\nNichols, the would-be-champion of Flagg, dropped him as he would have\r\nrun away from the contagion, and made a most ludicrous retreat from the\r\nfield of his own selection.\r\n\r\nTo quote Mr. J. Glancy Jones, in his able defense of this item of the\r\nAppropriation Bill brought in by his Committee, would occupy too much\r\nspace here; but the spicy debate between Messrs. Nichols, Kelly, and\r\nWashburne cannot be entirely omitted in a memoir of Mr. Kelly’s life.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols: “I cannot take my seat without paying a just tribute to\r\nthe late Mr. Marcy, and Mr. Flagg, who had charge of the preparation of\r\nthe volume known as the ‘Commercial Relations.’ I would enquire of the\r\ngentleman (Mr. J. Glancy Jones) whether the former Superintendent did\r\nnot resign his office under the express declaration that a discharge\r\nof the duties of the office was no longer necessary; and whether after\r\nthat, and during this year, a successor was appointed?”\r\n\r\nMr. J. Glancy Jones: “I do not know what induced the gentleman alluded\r\nto to resign the office.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I have made some enquiry on this subject, and from the best\r\ninformation I could get, I learned that Mr. Flagg was compelled to\r\nresign because there were charges made against him, to the effect that\r\nhe had employed women ostensibly at four dollars a day, and only paid\r\nthem at two dollars a day, requiring their receipts for four dollars\r\na day. This fact was ascertained by the gentleman who represents the\r\nCommittee on Commerce of the Senate. When he found that such was the\r\ncase, he went to the State Department and said, that if Mr. Flagg\r\nwas not turned out of that office, he would expose the matter to the\r\ncountry. This was the reason that Mr. Flagg was compelled to resign.\r\nSo far as the Bureau itself is concerned, every gentleman knows that\r\nthere is no Bureau in the Government that has been so effective in\r\ngiving the country valuable statistical information. But Mr. Flagg\r\nbeing compelled to resign, now comes to Congress, and makes the effort\r\nto abolish a Bureau which has been of so much benefit to the country.”\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols: “I beg leave to say that so far as my action here is\r\nconcerned, Mr. Flagg has nothing to do with it whatever. He has been\r\nconnected with that Bureau, but I have spoken to him hardly half a\r\ndozen times.”\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols, but a few minutes before, had been extolling Flagg, and\r\ncoupled his name with that of Secretary Marcy in what he called a “just\r\ntribute.” Now he wriggles out of the debate in the following amusing\r\nstyle:\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols: “I desire to conclude what I have to say. I wish the\r\ngentleman from New York to understand that, in reference to anything he\r\nmay say about troubles in the Democratic camp which may have led to the\r\nremoval of any of its children, I desire to enter into no discussion.\r\nI have nothing to do with it, then, or the difficulties of this happy\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I think the gentleman from Ohio is entirely in error.\r\nThe duty of the statisticians in the State Department is to collate\r\nand compile all the reports made by consuls at foreign ports upon\r\ncommercial matters, and everything which pertains to the welfare and\r\nbenefit of this Government. It is done not only for the benefit of\r\ncommercial men, but for the benefit of the community generally, and I\r\nthink the abolition of that particular branch of the Government would\r\nbe entirely wrong. The whole expense of keeping it up amounts to very\r\nlittle. I say again that the whole of this matter originated—though\r\nI do not attribute it to the gentleman from Ohio—on the part of\r\ndisappointed gentlemen who had been turned out of office, and in\r\nnothing else.”\r\n\r\nMr. Washburne, of Illinois: “My object in asking my friend to yield\r\nme the floor is to say a word here in reference to Mr. Flagg. I have\r\nhad some acquaintance with that gentleman from my connection with this\r\nmatter during the last Congress, and I am astonished at the charges the\r\ngentleman from New York has made here to-day; and I think it is due to\r\nMr. Flagg that the gentleman from New York should state his authority.\r\nThose charges go to the country, and reflect severely upon Mr. Flagg.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I have made no charge, and shall make no charge against the\r\ngentleman.”\r\n\r\nMr. Washburne “Will the gentleman state his authority for what he has\r\nsaid?”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “The State Department itself. If the gentleman desires to\r\nhave this matter investigated, let him introduce a resolution for that\r\npurpose. If information on the subject be desired for the House and the\r\ncountry, let a resolution be introduced and passed calling on the State\r\nDepartment to furnish it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Maynard: “I should like to know who is the present head of the\r\nBureau?”\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols: “These interruptions have entirely broken the thread of\r\nmy remarks. With the discussion of family differences and difficulties\r\nwhich have led to the removal of one man and the substitution of\r\nanother, I have nothing to do, and I desire to have nothing to do with\r\nthem. I do not know who fills this office. It is nothing to me who\r\ndoes. I find I have occupied about enough of the time of the Committee\r\nwith this question.”[48]\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Statistics flourished on, and was no longer disturbed\r\nby Edmund Flagg. Mr. Kelly had overwhelmingly refuted the charges of\r\nMessrs. Nichols and Washburne against the management of the State\r\nDepartment under General Cass.\r\n\r\nThere was a warm controversy between the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives over the appropriations for the naval service for the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1859. Committees of Conference on the disagreeing\r\nvotes of the two Houses were appointed, and held frequent meetings. The\r\nmanagers on the part of the Senate were Stephen R. Mallory, Solomon\r\nFoot, and Judah P. Benjamin; those on the part of the House were Thomas\r\nS. Bocock, John Kelly and F. H. Morse. The conferees finally agreed\r\nupon their report. Mr. Bocock submitted the report to the House, June\r\n11, 1858. Of the few amendments in controversy, the House Committee\r\nreceded from their disagreement to the second and third amendments,\r\nrelating to an appropriation of fifty thousand six hundred dollars for\r\na new purchase in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Messrs. Morgan, Grow, Clemens\r\nand others energetically opposed this appropriation. Mr. Bocock and Mr.\r\nKelly of the Conference Committee as strongly advocated it. The members\r\nof the Conference Committees of both Houses had unanimously approved\r\nthe report, and each of the managers had signed it. Mr. Kelly answered\r\nthe objections to this appropriation.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly: “I will say a word on this matter with the permission of the\r\ngentleman from Virginia. The Government owns the land between the Navy\r\nYard and the Marine Hospital. It is now all, or nearly all, a swamp. A\r\npart has been filled in, and filled in, I believe, for the very small\r\nprice of sixteen cents a yard. As the property now stands, it cannot be\r\nof any use to the Government. Even if the Government desires to sell,\r\nit would be a sound economy and prudent foresight to first fill it in.\r\nIt would then command a large price. It extends for a considerable\r\nway along what is called the Wallabout, and it shows a complete\r\nwater-front. If the Government filled it in at the rate contracted for\r\nbefore, they might sell lots there for large sums, which are now of\r\nno earthly use to anybody. Until it is filled in the Marine Barracks\r\nordered by Congress cannot be built; and the Marines at that Yard are\r\nnow quartered in sheds. They are small, and not at all suitable for the\r\npurpose for which they have been temporarily put up. I hope, therefore,\r\nthat this appropriation will be concurred in. I am convinced that it is\r\nneeded and needed now.”[49]\r\n\r\nThe objectors, however, were unyielding, and the report of the\r\nCommittee of Conference was disagreed to by a vote of 74 noes to 67\r\nayes.\r\n\r\nThe interests of Brooklyn always have had a warm advocate in Mr. Kelly,\r\nand although in more recent days he has found there some of his most\r\nactive political opponents, it may be doubted whether those gentlemen\r\nhave proved themselves truer friends of the general interests of that\r\ngreat city than John Kelly.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter of this book allusion has been made to the many\r\ngross misrepresentations of Mr. Kelly’s motives and actions to which\r\nthe press has given circulation. A glaring instance of this bearing\r\nof false witness against the neighbor is to be found in a volume\r\nentitled _The American Irish_, by “Philip H. Bagenal, B. A., Oxon.”\r\nThis Mr. Bagenal seems to be, not an American Irishman, but an English\r\nIrishman of the London Tory variety, whose booklet smacks of the facile\r\ncourtier of some Cabinet Minister, not far off from Downing Street or\r\nPall Mall. It is a libel on Ireland and Irishmen at home and abroad,\r\nnow on Mr. Parnell in Wicklow, and again on Mr. Kelly in New York.\r\nBagenal writes not so well, but after the fashion of Dr. Russell,\r\nanother English Irishman, familiarly known as “Bull Run Russell.” The\r\nlatter’s vulgar caricatures of President Lincoln, in his letters to\r\nthe London _Times_, caused his expulsion from the military lines of\r\nthe Federal army during the war. Peripatetic book-makers from abroad,\r\nwho take hasty journeys through this country, generally contrive to\r\npick up a budget of miscellaneous misinformation, which they cram\r\ninto misbegotten books, and offer for sale in the London market.\r\nMr. Bagenal’s mission appears to have been to contribute an English\r\ntract on Irish life in the United States, for English partisan use in\r\nIreland. To say that the alleged facts in this book are frequently\r\nuntrue, is to characterize the performance very mildly. Mr. Parnell\r\nand his followers, according to Bagenal, are enemies of Ireland,\r\nand architects of ruin and anarchy only less reprehensible than the\r\ndynamiters.\r\n\r\n“In New York,” says this scribe of the London _Times_, “we find the\r\nIrish dying faster than any others, less given to marriage than any\r\nothers, and more given to hard work and fasting than any others. * *\r\nI visited the tenement houses in New York where the Irish population\r\ndwell. * * Everywhere the moral atmosphere is one of degradation and\r\nhuman demoralization. Gross sensuality prevails. The sense of shame,\r\nif ever known, is early stifled. * * Thus live the descendants of\r\nthe great Irish exodus of 1845-48. * * They sought such occupation\r\nas offered; they underbid labor, adapted themselves manfully to\r\nthe conditions of industry, or joined the rabble that trooped as\r\n‘ballot-stuffers’ and ‘shoulder-hitters’ in the train of the Tweeds,\r\nthe Morrisseys, and the Kellys of the day; and so became the scourge of\r\nAmerican politics. In those bygone days when the Irish-American nation\r\nbegan to grow on Yankee soil, had Government directed and assisted\r\nthe tide of emigration, hundreds of thousands would have been carried\r\nout West; where, accustomed to agricultural pursuits, they would have\r\nbecome quiet and prosperous citizens, instead of fire-brands and\r\nperpetuators of the animosity between England and Ireland.”[50]\r\n\r\nThis slanderous picture of the Irish population in New York is followed\r\nby an account of Bishop Ireland’s noble efforts to build up an Irish\r\ncolony in Minnesota, and the great West. Mr. Bagenal holds up Mr. Kelly\r\nas an enemy of this great movement. What a pity he did not ask Bishop\r\nIreland, with whom, he says, he became acquainted at St. Paul, who were\r\nthe leading co-workers with that pious churchman in opening up a home\r\nfor Irish settlers in the new States of the West? Bagenal would have\r\nlearned from Bishop Ireland, had he sought to know the truth, that\r\nJohn Kelly had aided this philanthropic work by giving to the Bishop\r\none thousand dollars, afterwards increased to nearly two thousand, as\r\na contribution to the St. Paul Catholic Colonization Bureau. Knowledge\r\nof this circumstance probably would not have deterred Bagenal, the\r\nvilifier of Mr. Parnell, from describing Mr. Kelly as the enemy to\r\nIrish colonization in the West. The typical London snob abroad is\r\nrevealed in the mendacious sentence concerning “the rabble that trooped\r\nas ‘ballot-stuffers’ and ‘shoulder-hitters’ in the train of the Tweeds,\r\nthe Morrisseys and the Kellys of the day,” and sufficiently proves the\r\nDowning Street inspiration of this Tory romancer, who, it appears from\r\nhis preface, is a writer for the London _Times_.\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly, throughout his whole career, has been an earnest advocate\r\nfor the settlement on the fertile prairies of the West of the poor\r\nemigrants who crowd into the Eastern cities, too often to starve for\r\nthe want of employment. Twenty-seven years ago he introduced one of\r\nthe first Homestead bills brought forward in Congress, which was a\r\nstatesmanlike effort to relieve the overcrowded population of the great\r\ncities, and to build up the prosperity and happiness of the struggling\r\nmasses of his fellow-citizens. He supported this bill in a speech of\r\ngreat vigor, in which he pointed out the advantages of homes in the\r\nWest to the poor, and sought to place the acquisition of such homes\r\nwithin the reach of every citizen of the United States, who wished to\r\nbecome an actual settler upon the teeming millions of land that then\r\nbelonged to the Government. Had his bill been passed, the gigantic\r\nrailroad monopolies of to-day might not be in possession of the mighty\r\nlanded empire which they, in so many cases, acquired by fraud, and hold\r\nby corruption, against the rights of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January, 1858, Mr. Kelly introduced a bill in Congress\r\nto secure homesteads to actual settlers upon the public domain. The\r\nbill was read a first and second time, and referred to the Committee on\r\nAgriculture. This great measure which Mr. Kelly then brought forward,\r\none of the most beneficent that ever claimed attention in the American\r\nCongress, was originally introduced by Andrew Johnson, March 27, 1846,\r\nthen a Representative in Congress from Tennessee. More than six years\r\nelapsed before the House acted on this bill, but the indomitable Andrew\r\nJohnson, future President of the United States, persevered in his\r\nstatesmanlike advocacy of the measure, and the House of Representatives\r\nfinally passed it May 12, 1852, by a majority of two thirds. The bill,\r\nunfortunately, failed in the Senate. The same bill, in substance,\r\nwas again introduced in the House in 1853 by John L. Dawson of\r\nPennsylvania, where it was passed a second time by an overwhelming\r\nmajority. As it had done before, the Senate again rejected the bill,\r\nunder the mistaken notion that it would weaken some of the old States\r\nto allow a flood-tide of population to pour into the new ones.\r\n\r\nThe next attempt to carry through the measure in Congress, and to\r\nbestow happy homesteads on homeless millions of American citizens, was\r\nthat of Mr. Kelly of January 18th, 1858. About the same time Andrew\r\nJohnson, then a Senator, introduced a similar bill in the Senate,\r\nand became, as before, its powerful champion. The House, being in\r\nthe Committee of the Whole, May 25, Mr. Kelly made one of the ablest\r\nspeeches of his life on the Homestead Bill. The length of the speech,\r\nand the scope of this volume, preclude its reproduction here. A few\r\nextracts are all that can be given:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Chairman,” said he, “I regret that the bill which I had referred\r\nto the Committee on Agriculture, in the early part of this Session,\r\nhas not as yet been reported on, as I would have much preferred\r\naddressing my remarks on the homestead question to the bill itself. I\r\nwill take occasion to observe, in passing, that the Committees of this\r\nHouse have been prompt in making their reports even on matters that\r\nsink into insignificance when compared with the question of giving an\r\nhumble homestead to actual settlers on the lands of the Government. If\r\nthe Committee should think proper to delay their report much longer,\r\nI shall feel it to be my duty, at an early day, to move for their\r\ndischarge from the further consideration of the subject, and ask leave\r\nto bring the bill directly before the House. If the Senate bill does\r\nnot reach us in the meantime, I may fail even in this way to secure a\r\nvote on the question; but I will have the consolation to know that I\r\nhave done my duty to those of our fellow-citizens who are either too\r\nmodest or too poor to command much influence in this Hall.”\r\n\r\n“The main provision of the bill now before the Committee consists\r\nin the liberal appropriation contained in the first section, in the\r\nfollowing words: ‘That any person who is the head of a family, or who\r\nhas arrived at the age of twenty-one years, and is a citizen of the\r\nUnited States, or who shall have filed his intention to become such,\r\nas required by the naturalization laws of the United States, shall,\r\nfrom and after the passage of this act, be entitled to enter, free of\r\ncost, one quarter section of vacant and unappropriated public lands\r\nwhich may, at the time the application is made, be subject to private\r\nentry, at $1.25 per acre, or a quantity equal thereto, to be located in\r\na body, in conformity with the legal sub-divisions of the public lands,\r\nand after the same shall have been surveyed.’”\r\n\r\n“The other sections of the bill are either explanatory of the first,\r\nor designed to guard against mistake or fraud in its execution. Its\r\ngeneral purport and object is, as its title indicates, to secure\r\nhomesteads to actual settlers on the public domain.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly next enters into a minute history of the vast extent of the\r\npublic lands of the United States, how and when title to them was\r\nacquired, from whom derived, and an interesting resumè of the subject\r\nfrom a period anterior to the adoption of Articles of Confederation\r\nbetween the thirteen original States, down to the latest acquisition of\r\nterritory in 1854, known as the Gadsden Purchase. After an instructive\r\nreview of European, and especially of English colonization, he\r\ncontinues as follows:\r\n\r\n“But, sir, humanity claims for this bill the serious consideration of\r\nevery member of this House, more especially of those who, like myself,\r\nrepresent in part any of the large and populous cities of the Union.\r\nFor the laboring classes, large cities and towns, with superabundant\r\npopulations, are too often but the portals from wretchedness to death.\r\nThey can find no employment whereby to earn their bread by the sweat of\r\ntheir brow, and idleness, poverty and crime are the inevitable results.\r\nThe very shifts they resort to, the avocations they follow in quest of\r\nsubsistence, even if they desire to live honestly, yield but scarcely\r\nsufficient to supply unwholesome, scanty, unnutritious diet; and hence\r\nthe statistics of city life exhibit a frightful mortality. * * Does not\r\nhumanity, then, as well as patriotism, invoke our favorable action\r\non a bill which will withdraw from our large cities this overplus\r\npopulation, and by giving a proper incentive to its industry and labor,\r\nrescue it from pauperism and death? It is not for the worthless vagrant\r\nwho is found in every large city, lurking amid the haunts of vice and\r\nwretchedness, I appeal. This pauperism strikes down those who are able\r\nand willing to work, and, therefore, are fit subjects for the bounty\r\nof Congress. It is a truism in political economy that when pauperism\r\nsiezes upon this class of citizens, the wages of labor are reduced to\r\nthe cost of subsistence. The whole class must therefore be subjected to\r\nthe necessity of working, rather to avoid the poor-house than to better\r\ntheir condition. Rescue these and such as these, not only from New York\r\nor Boston, or New Orleans or Baltimore, but from every city, and town,\r\nand village in the Union; rescue them from drudgery and death, and\r\ntransform them into useful and industrious citizens of a free Republic.\r\nThe earth which God made is man’s. Give him, at least, a share of it,\r\na spot for a cot and a garden, and a grave when he dies, else God will\r\nhold us as usurpers and faithless stewards, when the great day of\r\nreckoning shall come.”[51]\r\n\r\nNothing in the political career of John Kelly has been more marked than\r\nhis hostility to the great land cormorants, particularly the railroad\r\ncorporations, and in nearly all his public utterances from that day\r\nto this he has uniformly denounced the venal men who have controlled\r\nthe lobbies of Congress, and bought legislation by bribery and gifts,\r\nwhereby they have usurped so vast a part of the public domain. A true\r\nhistory of Congressional grants to those corporations has yet to be\r\nwritten. The annals of Congress show nothing so disgraceful, and so\r\ndisastrous to the public welfare, as the wholesale donations of the\r\nlands of the people to the great railroad monopolists.\r\n\r\nIn closing this rapid sketch of John Kelly’s Congressional career, it\r\nmay be observed that necessarily many things have been omitted which\r\nproperly should find a place in his complete biography. The object\r\nsought here is to elucidate his character, and the transactions which\r\nhave been selected for this purpose were among those in which he more\r\nespecially displayed the bent of his mind, his love of human kind, and\r\nthe practical business direction of his thoughts and language. Mr.\r\nKelly had not reached his thirty-fourth year when he entered Congress.\r\nHe had had no former experience in National politics, and was called\r\nupon to contend with statesmen of great ability, long service, and\r\nwith a large following in the House. Two or three terms are required,\r\ngenerally, before members can hope to attain prominence as legislators\r\nand debaters in a body where men of so much ability are in rivalry\r\nfor the palm of superiority. In spite of these obstacles, Mr. Kelly\r\ntook rank among the leading men even during his first term, and during\r\nhis second he was placed on the Committee of Ways and Means, the most\r\nimportant committee of the House, was recognized as one of the leaders\r\nof his party, and wielded an influence with the Administration scarcely\r\nexceeded by any one. Had he remained in the House of Representatives,\r\nconsidering the high position he won there in two terms, and judging\r\nfrom the remarkable ability he has displayed in his subsequent career,\r\nin all probability John Kelly would have become one of those few great\r\nparliamentary worthies whose names occupy so large a space in American\r\nhistory. He has given ample evidence that he possessed the requisite\r\nqualifications to have succeeded Stephen A. Douglas as leader of the\r\nNorthern Democracy, when death snatched the sceptre from the hands\r\nof that gifted man. Of the calibre of Kelly, the reader has seen the\r\nopinions in the preceding pages which were expressed by such weighty\r\nstatesmen as Lewis Cass, and Alexander H. Stephens. The gauge and\r\nmeasurement which those distinguished men took of him over a quarter\r\nof a century ago have been justified by the events of the past fifteen\r\nyears, and the marvellous grip upon the minds and imagination of the\r\nAmerican people which the very name of Kelly has come to possess.\r\n\r\nHardly had he taken his seat in Congress when he was confronted by\r\nWm. H. Seward, as leader of the Banks forces, in the famous contest\r\nover the Speakership in the Thirty-fourth Congress, and yet after nine\r\nweeks of stubborn battle in the House, John Kelly named a candidate,\r\nWilliam Aiken, as competitor against Mr. Seward’s candidate, and Aiken\r\ncame within two votes, in a House containing seventy-four Democrats\r\nand one hundred and four Republicans, of beating Mr. Banks for Speaker\r\nof the House of Representatives. In his second struggle with Mr.\r\nSeward, when the Collectorship of the Port of New York was at stake,\r\nMr. Kelly may be said to have entered the lists almost single handed\r\nagainst a powerful adverse interest in the Senate and House from his\r\nown State. He was, nevertheless, completely successful in securing the\r\nconfirmation by the Senate of Augustus Schell for that office, as he\r\nhad been mainly instrumental in procuring his nomination by President\r\nBuchanan. In a letter to a friend in New York, written some time after,\r\nMr. Kelly said: “Mr. Schell’s nomination was opposed very bitterly by\r\na large number of Democrats, and I have no doubt but that it was my\r\ninfluence with Clay, Orr, Dowdell, Shorter, Fitzpatrick, and I might\r\nsay quite a number of the members of the Senate, that brought about\r\nthe confirmation of Mr. Schell.” John Kelly and Augustus Schell were\r\ndevoted personal and political friends, although in the factional\r\ndivisions in New York the former had been a Soft Shell and the latter\r\na Hard Shell Democrat. They stood shoulder to shoulder in victory and\r\ndefeat, thinking the same things about the Republic, inseparable in\r\naffection and fellowship throughout a long and tempestuous period in\r\nthe politics of the country. In city, State and National conventions\r\nof the Democratic party these two men always appeared together, and in\r\ntheir journeys to and fro they travelled together, roomed together, sat\r\nat the same table, and presented a picture to the public eye of more\r\nthan brotherly affection. In looking at them, as they conversed with\r\neach other at such times, one would be reminded of Gales and Seaton in\r\nreal life, or of the Cheeryble Brothers of romance. The death of Mr.\r\nSchell, in 1884, was a grievous blow to Mr. Kelly. All who heard his\r\nspeech at the memorial meeting for his departed friend at Tammany Hall,\r\nwill remember the unwonted emotions under which he labored.\r\n\r\nSociety at the Capital during Mr. Kelly’s day in Congress was very\r\nagreeable and homelike, and the manners and tastes of the people\r\nwere formed in the school of frugality and simplicity well befitting\r\na Democratic Republic. Boast as men may of the material progress of\r\nthe country, the old school which held sway at Washington, during\r\nDemocratic Administrations, was the nursery of civic virtues, and had\r\nabout it the flavor of the golden age of the fathers. This was the\r\nschool Jefferson founded, and Madison and Monroe illustrated. It was\r\nthe school in which appeared John Taylor of Caroline, Rufus King,\r\nWilliam Pinkney, Governor Gore, Josiah Quincy, William Gaston, and\r\nLittleton Waller Tazewell. Along Pennsylvania Avenue John Marshall and\r\nDaniel Webster might be seen wending their way to market with baskets\r\non their arms, while Chancellor Bibb has gone fishing to the Long\r\nBridge, John Quincy Adams to have a swim in the Potomac, and John C.\r\nCalhoun has gone out in the old-fashioned omnibus to Georgetown College\r\nto talk philosophy with Father Dzierozynsky.[52] This society was based\r\non simplicity, the heritage handed down from Revolutionary soldiers,\r\noffshoot of freedom and downrightness. There was no charlatanism in\r\nWashington then, neither had there been any since Jefferson came to\r\ntell the people “we are all Republicans, all Federalists.” For fifty\r\nyears the official rogues could be counted on the ten fingers. How\r\ndifferent in that respect since the antique school has passed away. The\r\ngreat wars have blown out the old-fashioned virtues, and money-changers\r\nhave unhinged the morality of the people. Corruption in high places\r\nhas prevailed, and it has been in Washington as it was in Rome during\r\nthe last days of the Empire, when Fabricius and Tully were forgotten,\r\nand turgid and loquacious rhetoricians mouthed in the Capitol. The\r\ngolden age of manners, and tastes, and honest living still survived\r\nwhile the subject of this memoir sat in Congress. To be a gentleman\r\nabove reproach was glorious. Poverty was no badge of disgrace, for\r\nJames Monroe had given his fortune to the country in the war of 1812,\r\nand died, “like rigid Cincinnatus, nobly poor.” Henry Clay could never\r\nreach the White House, because after the fashion of the simple great\r\nones he would rather be right than President. Webster was an old school\r\npatriot, for after Calhoun’s speech in 1833, he modified his views so\r\ngreatly that he never afterwards denied that the Government of the\r\nUnited States was a compact between sovereign States. The rule of right\r\nliving was so inflexible that Calhoun relinquished all hopes for the\r\nPresidency, rather than have his wife visit Bellona, at the dictation\r\nof General Jackson.\r\n\r\nHappy days! Fortunate John Kelly! to have been there to witness the\r\nantique social phases, and to have come away again before the era was\r\nquite passed and gone, and another and a different one had arisen in\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] The reference in the speech was to the murder of a waiter named\r\nKeating, in the spring of 1856, at Willard’s Hotel, by a drunken\r\nCongressman from California named Herbert. Great indignation was\r\naroused by this unprovoked crime, and although after two trials,\r\nthe jury failing to agree in the first, Herbert was acquitted, his\r\nusefulness as a representative was destroyed. “He remained in Congress\r\ntill the end of his term,” says Gobright in his _Recollection of\r\nMen and Things at Washington_, “but failed to be respected by his\r\nfellow-members,” p. 164.\r\n\r\n[45] Cong.

OAKEY HALL—CAUSES OF HIS WITHDRAWAL—GOES TO\r\n EUROPE—VISITS HOLY LAND—INNER LIFE—HIS CHARITIES—RELATIONS WITH\r\n S. J. TILDEN—LEADER OF TAMMANY—SECOND MARRIAGE—COMPTROLLER OF NEW\r\n YORK—SPEECH AT LOTOS CLUB, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1858, having been elected Sheriff of the City and\r\nCounty of New York, November 2d of that year, Mr. Kelly resigned his\r\nseat in the Thirty-fifth Congress. He remained in Washington at his\r\npost until it was necessary to go to New York to enter upon his new\r\noffice; but in refreshing contrast to those Representatives in a\r\nsubsequent Congress, the Forty-second, who voted themselves back-pay,\r\nhe declined, after his election as Sheriff, to draw any salary at all\r\nfor his service as a member of Congress. The total number of votes cast\r\nat the election for Sheriff was 69,088, of which John Kelly received\r\n39,090, and William H. Albertson received 29,837, scattering 161.\r\nKelly was the regular nominee of the Democratic party of the city. His\r\nmajority was 9,092.\r\n\r\nHe entered with characteristic energy upon the duties of Sheriff,\r\nthat most ancient of county officers known to the common law,\r\n_Vice-comes_ to the Earl, as Blackstone calls him. The difficulties\r\nand responsibilities of this office in New York are peculiarly\r\ngreat. The reported cases upon Sheriff’s law in that city indicate\r\nthe immense number of statutes applicable to the office, and the\r\nsubtleties, refinements, and nice legal distinctions, together with\r\nthe liabilities, which constantly press upon the Sheriff in the\r\ndischarge of his duties. As laymen nearly always have been elected to\r\nthe office, it was the rule, before Kelly’s term, for incumbents to\r\nrely for guidance upon legal advisers and prompters behind the scenes,\r\nwhose special knowledge of business was supplemented by professional\r\nknowledge of law, and by training and experience in the office. But\r\nJohn Kelly set resolutely to work with his law books, for it is one of\r\nthe leading traits of his character to perform conscientiously whatever\r\nduties are imposed upon him, and he was determined to delegate to no\r\none else a labor which the people had elected him to do himself. While\r\nhe was in the office the Under-Sheriff ceased to be the High-Sheriff.\r\nAfter reading one or two good elementary books, he next applied himself\r\nto the Code of Procedure, the Revised Statutes, and Reported Cases,\r\nand wrote out a syllabus, or private digest for himself, of opinions\r\ndelivered in the lower Courts and the Court of Appeals in relation to\r\nSheriff’s law. To master such questions he worked with unflagging zeal,\r\nnot only by day but far into the night, during the greater part of his\r\nterm. In the meantime he acquired familiarity with the routine and\r\nusages of the office. Thus equipped, he was perhaps the first Sheriff\r\nwho thoroughly understood the duties of the office, and discharged them\r\nin person. He became a favorite among the members of the bar, and was\r\nan authority, theoretically and practically, upon disputed questions of\r\nSheriff’s law. In the Sheriff’s Court Mr. Kelly himself presided over\r\nthe intelligent juries there empanelled. He heard arguments of counsel,\r\npassed upon authorities cited, was conversant in the law applicable\r\nto cases, and in the opinion of leading members of the profession he\r\ndisplayed a judicial mind of high order.\r\n\r\nThe best body of jurors in the United States is undoubtedly the\r\nSheriff’s Jury in New York city. The members of this jury are chosen\r\nannually by an eminent Commission of judicial and other high officers,\r\nand are selected from among the foremost citizens in the community,\r\nwhose wealth, intelligence, and established character afford a\r\nguarantee of their freedom from improper influences. Large fines for\r\nabsence are imposed, and cheerfully paid. An annual banquet, known of\r\nall men, _ubique gentium_, as the Sheriff’s Jury’s Dinner, is provided\r\nfor with the ample sum thus accumulated. Delmonico’s choicest menu is\r\nlaid under requisition, and a distinguished and brilliant company is\r\nalways brought together.\r\n\r\nThat accomplished and discerning gentleman, Mr. Rosewell G. Rolston,\r\nPresident of the Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company of New York, was\r\none of the members of the Sheriff’s Jury during Mr. Kelly’s term. He\r\nonce expressed to the writer of these pages his high respect for the\r\nSheriff, and descanted upon his sturdy qualities, saying, that while he\r\nwas a stern and austere man to look at, he was, nevertheless, brimful\r\nof kindly human nature. After mentioning some occurrences which had\r\ncome under his own observation, he said, with no little earnestness,\r\n“John Kelly is a love of a man, a grand fellow undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\nUnder-Sheriffs had presided at the trial of Sheriff’s cases before Mr.\r\nKelly’s entry into the office. The Jury was surprised now to see the\r\nusual rule broken, and the new Sheriff going upon the bench himself.\r\nThe more experienced members gave each other a smile of astonishment\r\nand a knowing wink, for they suspected that Kelly was led away by\r\nzeal, and by ignorance of the mysteries of the law, into whose knotty\r\nlabyrinths he would be plunged presently by wrangling lawyers. But Mr.\r\nRolston and his fellow-jurors quickly discovered that the imperturbable\r\nSheriff behaved like a veteran under legal fire, and the lawyers\r\nthemselves were surprised to find him not only familiar with questions\r\nat issue, both of traverse and demurrer, but practically master of\r\nthe situation. He had broken the precedent, and what had been before\r\na fiction was now a fact, a Sheriff of New York who knew more about\r\nhis office than any of his subordinates. John Kelly made a reputation\r\nfor honesty and capacity as Sheriff, which in the whole history of the\r\noffice has never been excelled by any man who has occupied it. The\r\nbest evidence of this is found in the fact that at the earliest moment\r\nwhen he was eligible under the Constitution of the State, namely, at\r\nthe expiration of the term of Sheriff Lynch, his immediate successor,\r\nJohn Kelly was renominated and re-elected Sheriff of New York. He\r\nis the only man since the foundation of the Government who has been\r\nelected twice to this important office. In the early day, before the\r\nHamiltonian or monarchical features of the State Constitution had\r\nbeen abolished, and the Jeffersonian or elective principle had been\r\nsubstituted for them by constitutional amendment, the Governor and\r\nCouncil held the appointment, not only of judicial and other great\r\nofficers, a most fruitful source of corruption and centralization,\r\nbut they were likewise clothed with the power to appoint Sheriffs and\r\nCounty Clerks in the several counties of the State. But twice only,\r\nin the early history of the State, did the Council of Appointment at\r\nAlbany select the same men to fill a second term as Sheriff of the\r\ncity and county of New York. Marinus Willett was appointed Sheriff\r\nof New York in 1784, and served until 1787. He was re-appointed in\r\n1791, and held until 1795. Benjamin Ferris also held the office by\r\nappointment from 1808 to 1810, and again from 1811 to 1813. On the\r\n6th of November, 1864, John Kelly, who had filled the office so\r\nfaithfully from 1859 to 1861, was re-elected Sheriff of New York, an\r\nunprecedented honor, as well as endorsement of his official integrity,\r\nnow bestowed for the first time in the history of the city, by the\r\npeople themselves, upon any individual.\r\n\r\nAt this election there were three candidates in the field, two\r\nDemocrats and a Republican, but after an exciting canvass John Kelly\r\nled the poll by a plurality of nearly 6,000, his Republican competitor\r\ncoming next. The whole number of votes for Sheriff was 106,707, of\r\nwhich Kelly received 42,022, John W. Farmer 36,477, and Michael\r\nConnolly, commonly called the “Big Judge,” 28,099. The number of\r\nscattering votes was 109. Mr. Kelly’s second term expired December 31,\r\n1867. That it was a repetition of the first one in his fidelity to the\r\nimportant interests and duties confided to his charge, was universally\r\ndeclared at the time, without one whisper of dissent. In the fierce\r\nconflicts of party fifteen years after his first term as Sheriff, and\r\nseven years after the second, when his talents and commanding position\r\nin the community had made him a formidable antagonist, John Kelly’s\r\nofficial integrity as Sheriff was called in question for the first time\r\nby certain political opponents, whose misconduct he had exposed, and\r\nwhose arbitrary acts he had resisted. These tardy shafts of malice fell\r\nharmless at his feet.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1868, eleven months after he had ceased to be Sheriff a\r\nsecond time, a still handsomer testimonial to the stainlessness of his\r\ncharacter was tendered to him than that implied in his re-election as\r\nSheriff; an emphatic endorsement of his qualifications for the highest\r\ncivic preferment was received by him when the Democratic Union of New\r\nYork nominated him for Mayor of the city against A. Oakey Hall, the\r\ncandidate of the Tweed Ring. In a laudable and patriotic attempt to\r\ndrive the Ring from power at the Charter election of November, 1868,\r\nNew York’s best citizens,—merchants, bankers, tradesmen, mechanics,\r\nand members of the various professions, turned to John Kelly to lead\r\nthem, to the man whose admirable administration of the trusts he\r\nhad previously held as Alderman, Congressman, and Sheriff, afforded\r\nsatisfactory proof of his fitness to grapple with the Ring, and if\r\nelected, to crush it, and restore honesty and economy in the various\r\nmunicipal offices.\r\n\r\nAmong those who looked to Mr. Kelly at this interesting and critical\r\nhour in the history of New York, as a safe leader against the notorious\r\ntriumvirate of Tweed, Sweeny and Connolly, were Samuel J. Tilden,\r\nAndrew H. Green, Augustus Schell, and still another—tell it not in\r\nGath! mention it not in the streets of Ascalon! for it is surprising\r\nto relate—Nelson J. Waterbury himself. Yes, in the very next year\r\nafter John Kelly had ceased to be Sheriff, this gentleman, who has\r\nsince lavished so much savage abuse upon him for mythical misdeeds\r\nas Sheriff, the self-same Nelson J. Waterbury was an enthusiastic\r\nsupporter of John Kelly for Mayor of New York.\r\n\r\nThe support which Mr. Tilden was disposed to bestow upon Mr. Kelly\r\nwas a more important incident of that eventful campaign. For a long\r\ntime they had been intimate acquaintances, and Tilden not only looked\r\nupon Kelly as a man of invincible honesty, but recognized in him a\r\nborn leader of men. It was a most unfortunate thing that Mr. Kelly’s\r\nhealth, at this particular juncture, was so much impaired that it was\r\nnot possible for him to stand the strain of such a contest, or, indeed,\r\nof any contest at all. The blackest chapter in the history of New\r\nYork was about to be written. He felt the magnitude of the occasion,\r\nand rose from a sick bed to go meet the people half way, when they\r\ncalled him to lead them in the fight. No personal sacrifice could be\r\ntoo great, not even life itself, when the stakes were the reformation\r\nof the public service, and the rescue of a million people from the\r\ncorrupt domination of such a Ring. “You will never live to reach the\r\narmy,” said Voltaire to the feeble and emaciated Mareschal de Saxe, as\r\nthe leader was setting out for Fontenoy. “The object now,” replied the\r\nfiery commander, “is not to live, but to go.” But Mr. Kelly, however\r\nwilling to act his part, soon found that nature’s barriers are not to\r\nbe overcome. The hand which had rejoiced in its strength was relaxed\r\nand powerless under wasting illness, and like that of Old Priam,\r\n_telumque imbelle_, no longer could strike an effectual blow. He was,\r\nindeed, destined to smite the Tweed Ring a death-blow, but not now, nor\r\nuntil four years had come and gone, when, with health restored, and\r\nenergies all on fire, he drove them from Tammany Hall, and inscribed\r\nhis name among the benefactors of New York. He lived, like Saxe, to\r\nfight and win his Fontenoy.\r\n\r\nFrom early life Mr. Kelly had suffered from bronchial troubles, which\r\nalways were increased by public speaking. His mind is intensely\r\nactive. “I must be occupied in some way,” he once said to a friend,\r\n“and I can’t sit still five minutes without doing something. I cannot\r\nbe an idler.”[53] Whatever he undertook to do, his faculties became\r\nconcentrated upon the task until it was accomplished. His occupations\r\nfor a long time had been engrossing and laborious, and his health had\r\nsuffered under the strain. “For twenty years,” to repeat the remark\r\nof the editor of the _Utica Observer_, quoted in a preceding chapter\r\nof this volume, “he had devoted several hours of every day to the\r\npursuit of literature and science,” and at length his constitution was\r\nseriously impaired. Domestic afflictions also came upon him about this\r\nperiod, and his physical maladies were increased fourfold.\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly had entered into wedlock when a very young man, and for\r\ntwenty years his circle of domesticity was unclouded by a single\r\nshadow. His wife, _nèe_ McIlhargy, was the daughter of an Irish\r\nadopted citizen of New York, and an interesting family, a son and two\r\ndaughters, grew up to the verge of manhood and womanhood about him.\r\nMrs. Kelly, whom the present writer knew well, and greatly respected\r\nfor the excellent but unostentatious qualities of her character, was\r\na good wife, a devoted mother and a pious Christian woman. In the\r\nyear 1866 she fell a victim to consumption. Her son Hugh, a bright\r\nand winning young man, just as he had turned his twenty-first year,\r\nsuccumbed to the same disease, and followed his mother to the grave.\r\nSymptoms of consumption also appeared in the daughters, and it was\r\nevident that death had marked them both for its early victims. To a\r\nman of John Kelly’s strongly affectionate nature, wrapped up in his\r\nhome and family, these visitations falling upon him like unmerciful\r\ndisasters, one after another in quick succession, proved well nigh\r\nirreparable. His health already impaired, gave way entirely, and his\r\nfriends were seriously apprehensive of his own early demise.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of these afflictions that he was nominated for\r\nMayor against A. Oakey Hall. He was placed in nomination by the\r\nDemocratic Union, which held its convention at Masonic Hall, November\r\n18, 1868, and he received on the first ballot 240 votes, to 51 for\r\nJohn W. Chanler, and 1 each for John McKeon and Fernando Wood. On the\r\nsecond ballot John Kelly received every vote in the convention, and was\r\ndeclared the unanimous nominee for Mayor. A committee was appointed by\r\nthe chair, Mr. Roswell D. Hatch, to notify Mr. Kelly of his nomination,\r\nand to invite him before the convention. The chairman of this committee\r\nwas Mr. Nelson J. Waterbury. After some time Mr. Kelly entered the hall\r\nescorted by Mr. Waterbury, by whom he was presented to the convention\r\nin appropriate terms, as the reform candidate for Mayor.\r\n\r\nHe was warmly received, and made a brief speech, vigorously denouncing\r\nthe Tweed and Sweeny Ring, which had usurped control of Tammany Hall.\r\nHe referred in terms of praise to those honest Democrats, many of whom\r\nhe saw before him, who formerly like himself had been identified with\r\nthe Wigwam, but who had retired from it in disgust, as he himself\r\nhad done when the Ring obtained control. “I see many gentlemen in\r\nthis convention,” said Mr. Kelly, “who formerly were associated with\r\nme in Tammany Hall, and who felt the same grievances there which I\r\nmyself have experienced. I have no desire for this nomination, but\r\nwhile I have not sought it, I will only say this, I shall stand by\r\nthose who have so generously nominated me for Mayor, and if elected,\r\nI will discharge the duties of the office honestly and faithfully. In\r\naccepting your nomination I fully realize that both yourselves and\r\nmyself will have to work strenuously against the corrupt men opposing\r\nus, if we expect to secure victory. But by working together in good\r\nfaith we can succeed, for the people of New York feel the importance\r\nof the contest, and the necessity of putting down the bad men who have\r\nobtained control of the city government. I accept your nomination, and\r\nif elected will do the best in my power to realize all your legitimate\r\nexpectations.”[54]\r\n\r\nAbram R. Lawrence was nominated for Corporation Counsel. The candidacy\r\nof Mr. Kelly greatly alarmed the Ring leaders and their Republican\r\nallies. The latter sought to control the Republican convention which\r\nwas held the next day, and force through a straight Republican ticket\r\nfor Mayor and Corporation Counsel, as the most effective way to secure\r\nthe election of A. Oakey Hall. But fortunately there was a reform\r\nelement among the Republicans, as well as among the Democrats, and\r\nthe opponents of the Ring were in a majority in the Republican city\r\nconvention. That excellent citizen, Mr. Sinclair Tousey, was President\r\nof this convention. The main struggle was between those who favored\r\nthe endorsement of John Kelly for Mayor, and, therefore, wished\r\nthe convention to adjourn over, and those who advocated the prompt\r\nnomination of a straight Republican ticket. The latter class was led\r\nby Charles S. Spencer, who vehemently demanded immediate action. But\r\nthe opponents of Spencer prevailed, and secured an adjournment to\r\nthe following Monday. “It was understood,” remarked the _Herald_ of\r\nNovember 20th, “that the party of compromise was engaged in fixing up\r\nquite a neat little arrangement, by which the Republicans would endorse\r\nthe nomination of John Kelly for Mayor, in consideration of having Mr.\r\nShaw substituted for Mr. Lawrence as candidate for Corporation Counsel.\r\nThe compromisers gave out that Spencer and the party of action were\r\nsimply acting in the interest of Tammany Hall in endeavoring to have\r\nthe Republican convention make regular nominations.”\r\n\r\nIn this campaign the _Herald_ opposed John Kelly, and championed A.\r\nOakey Hall for Mayor. This was not evidence of any complicity on the\r\npart of that paper in the misconduct of the Ring, for in 1868 there was\r\nno positive proof in possession of the public of the criminality of\r\nthe Ring, and hence the _Herald_ or any other journal was not justly\r\nobnoxious to unfavorable criticism at that early day in the history\r\nof the plunderers for advocating the election of Hall. “The Ring,”\r\nsays Mr. Tilden in his history of its overthrow, “became completely\r\norganized and matured on the 1st of January, 1869, when Mr. A. Oakey\r\nHall became Mayor. Its duration was through 1869, 1870 and 1871.”[55]\r\n\r\nThe morning after Mr. Kelly’s nomination the _Herald_ declared for\r\nA. Oakey Hall and against Kelly, in one of those plausible leading\r\narticles by which it has so long and so remarkably influenced public\r\nopinion for or against men and measures. The reference to Mr. Kelly as\r\na nabob was an adroit campaign stroke, and although he was living quite\r\nunostentatiously in a modest three-story brick house at the corner of\r\n38th Street and Lexington Avenue, an impression was created that he was\r\nsurrounded by princely opulence, in the fashionable quarter among the\r\nmillionaires. The _Herald_ editorial was as follows:\r\n\r\n“John Kelly is a good citizen and a respectable man; but he has already\r\nbeen elected by the Tammany Democracy, to which he owes all his past\r\npolitical favors, to the offices of Councilman, Alderman, member of\r\nCongress, and twice to the valuable position of Sheriff of New York,\r\nbeing the only man, we believe, who has held that lucrative office a\r\nsecond term. John Kelly was brought up a lad in the _Herald_ office,\r\nwhen he first came to New York, and was well brought up; but he went\r\ninto politics in spite of his early training. We supported him for\r\noffice while he was poor and lived in the locality of the Fourteenth\r\nWard. Now that he has made himself a millionaire, and lives like a\r\nnabob in the high locality of one of the most fashionable avenues of\r\nuppertendom, we think he should be satisfied, and give place to others\r\nwho have not enjoyed such good fortune.”\r\n\r\n“If the Democrats nominate A. Oakey Hall, as it is said they will,\r\nas their candidate for Mayor, he will no doubt be elected by a large\r\nmajority. He will suit those who take a pride in the dignity of the\r\ncity, because he is a man of superior ability, a profound thinker,\r\nan eloquent talker, and understands thoroughly the details of the\r\nmunicipal government.”[56]\r\n\r\nThe Ring men got thoroughly frightened after the adjournment of the\r\nRepublican City Convention without a nomination, for it was becoming\r\nquite clear that independent citizens, both outside and inside of the\r\nrespective political parties, meant to support Mr. Kelly for Mayor\r\nagainst the Ring candidate. This state of things caused the _Herald_ to\r\ndiscard special pleading respecting the “nabobs of uppertendom,” and to\r\nredouble its attacks on Kelly. He was now denounced as a deserter for\r\nhaving retired from Tammany Hall, and joined the opponents of William\r\nM. Tweed. “The fight,” said the _Herald_, “is to be made against the\r\nDemocratic organization with the object of breaking down Tammany, and\r\nthus giving the death-blow to the regular Democracy in its stronghold.\r\nThe _Tribune_, _Times_ and _World_ are co-laborers in this work—the two\r\nformer openly, and the latter in an underhanded but not less vindictive\r\nmanner. They are preparing to unite on John Kelly, who has deserted\r\nthe Democratic organization for the purpose of leading the Republican\r\nforces in the battle. District Attorney A. Oakey Hall will be the\r\nDemocratic nominee, and will no doubt be elected; but it will be one of\r\nthe greatest fights we have ever had over a Charter election, as the\r\nbreaking down of the Democratic organization at this end of the State\r\nwould be the death-blow of the party, and is therefore a stake worth\r\nplaying for by the Republicans, who feel the loss of power in New York\r\nvery severely.”[57]\r\n\r\nAgainst this pretended but sham regularity, not only Mr. Kelly, but Mr.\r\nTilden also revolted. “Weighty pressure,” says Tilden, “was brought\r\non me from powerful men all over the State to ‘save the party.’ I\r\ndenied that the system of organization then in use in the city had\r\nany moral right to be considered regular, or to bind the Democratic\r\nmasses. I told the State Convention that I felt it to be my duty to\r\noppose any man who would not go for making the government of this city\r\nwhat it ought to be, at whatever cost, at whatever sacrifice. If they\r\ndid not deem that ‘regular,’ I would resign as chairman of the State\r\nCommittee.”[58]\r\n\r\nThe exertion made by Mr. Kelly in leaving a sick bed to go before the\r\nDemocratic Union City Convention to accept its nomination for Mayor,\r\nincreased the illness from which he suffered. His physician called\r\neminent doctors into consultation, and it was the opinion of them all\r\nthat his continuance in active political movements would have a fatal\r\nresult. This professional decision was communicated to Mr. Kelly by\r\nthat eminent physician, the late Dr. Marion Sims. Thus admonished that\r\nthe excitement of the campaign would kill him, Mr. Kelly, on the 27th\r\nof November, reluctantly sent in his withdrawal from the Mayoralty\r\ncontest to the Executive Committee of the Democratic Union, and the\r\nvacancy was filled by the nomination of Mr. Frederick A. Conkling.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly, who was a sufferer from insomnia, soon after sailed with his\r\ntwo daughters for Europe. He made an extended tour in Europe, Asia and\r\nAfrica, visiting, among other places, the Holy Land. He first went to\r\nIreland as a pilgrim would return to the home of his fathers, spending\r\nsome time in the beautiful Island of Saints, where Christianity made\r\nits only bloodless conquest in the world. During fourteen hundred\r\nyears, while other Christian nations have rushed back into infidelity\r\nand again become Christian, Ireland has never lapsed into infidelity,\r\nnor into a scoffing, Godless philosophy, the invariable accompaniment\r\nof unbelief and paganism. After visiting the various capitals of\r\nEurope,—London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, St. Petersburg, and\r\nother places, he repaired to Rome, the city of the soul, the Niobe\r\nof nations, shrine of saints and martyrs, of doctors and confessors,\r\nwhere he spent a considerable period in rest and retirement, and in\r\nviewing its wonderful ruins, monuments, and churches. Repairing to Holy\r\nLand, Mr. Kelly remained for some time at Jerusalem, the cradle of\r\nChristianity; which Titus, in fulfilment of prophecy, left not a stone\r\nupon a stone of; where Christ had walked about among the people, and\r\nwhere He died upon Calvary.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating scenes associated with the earthly life and death\r\nof the Redeemer, the traveler no doubt derived comfort in his own\r\nbereavements, dignified by such a fellowship of suffering as was there.\r\nWhat a lesson of humility the ignominious Cross must have preached\r\nto his reflective mind. He was leading a contemplative life, and his\r\nletters at this period dwell much upon the Mount of Olives, the Way of\r\nthe Cross, and the Holy Sepulchre. He had read somewhere in allegory\r\nof the contest in which the trees of the forest are represented as\r\ndebating among themselves who should be their king. Had the contest\r\noccurred in the days of the Redeemer, small chance the ignoble tree of\r\nthe Cross would have had to win the crown. Mr. Kelly had read Cardinal\r\nWiseman’s beautiful thoughts on the subject. “Apply the allegory,”\r\nsaid he once in a circle of his friends, “and let us enter some forest\r\nof Judea filled with stately trees, lofty, tapering pine, and royal\r\ncedar, and hear the proud possessor give orders as to how their worth\r\nshould be realized into wealth. He says to the forester: ‘See that\r\nelegant and towering tree which has reached the maturity of its growth,\r\nhow nobly will it rise above the splendid galley and bear itself in\r\nthe fell fury of the wind, without breaking or bending, and carry\r\nthe riches of the earth from one flourishing port to another. Cut it\r\ndown and destine it for this noble work. And this magnificent cedar,\r\novercasting all around it with the solemnity of its shade, worthy to\r\nhave been built by Solomon into the temple of God, such that David\r\nmight have sung its praises on his inspired lyre; let it be carefully\r\nand brilliantly polished, and embarked to send to the imperial city,\r\nthere to adorn those magnificent halls, in which all the splendor of\r\nRome is gathered; and there, richly gilded and adorned, it shall be an\r\nobject of admiration for ages to come.’ ‘It is well, my lord,’ replies\r\nhis servant, ‘but this strange, this worthless tree, which seems\r\npresumptuously to spring up, beneath the shadow of those splendid\r\nshafts, what shall we do with it? it is fitted for no great, no noble\r\nwork.’ ‘Cut it down, and, if of no other use, why, it will make a cross\r\nfor the first malefactor!’”\r\n\r\nStrange counsels of men! The soaring pine dashed the freight that\r\nit bore against the rocks, and rolled a wreck upon the beach. The\r\nnoble cedar witnessed the revels of imperial Rome, and fell by the\r\nearthquake, or in the fire kindled by the barbarians, charred into\r\nashes. But that ignoble tree, spurned by proud man and put to the\r\nmost ignominious of uses, bore the price of the world’s redemption\r\nupon Calvary, its every fragment has been gathered up, and treasured\r\nand enshrined, and in every age it has been considered worth all that\r\nthe world dotes on, and sets its heart on. An Empress crossed the\r\nseas and searched among the tombs of the dead for that material wood\r\nof the Cross of Christ. For that holy rood was built a magnificent\r\nchurch on Mount Sion. For it the Emperor Heraclius made war on the\r\nKing of Persia; and when he had recovered it, bore it as his Master\r\nhad borne it before, barefoot and in humble garb to Calvary. For that\r\ntree Constantine the Great built a noble church, yet standing among\r\nthe ruins of the palaces of Rome, and brought the very earth from the\r\nSavior’s own land, as though none were worthy to be there save that\r\nupon which had first fallen the precious blood of redemption. For\r\neighteen hundred years this relic has been the most priceless treasure\r\nof Christians. Its smallest fragment has been enshrined and vestured\r\nin gold and precious stones, and housed and sheltered in magnificent\r\ntemples piled up with the richest materials and noblest productions of\r\nart. The ignoble tree which the world despised has conquered the world\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s correspondence at this time made it apparent that he had\r\nceased to feel interest in the busy trifles of politicians, and that\r\nhis thoughts were directed to problems of the moral world, to reveries\r\nupon the mysteries of redemption, like that outlined in the preceding\r\nallegory upon the Cross, and to the works of mercy, both spiritual and\r\ncorporal. He brought back from Palestine souvenirs and patristic relics\r\nof much interest. He had familiarized himself with the topography of\r\nthe hallowed scenes of Holy Land, and those who have heard him describe\r\nthem and relate the history and traditions connected with them, have\r\nbeen struck with his reverence as a narrator, as well as with his\r\ncloseness as an observer of manners, customs and places. While he was\r\nabroad unfounded rumors reached New York that John Kelly had withdrawn\r\nfrom the world, in order to spend the remainder of his days in monastic\r\nretirement. Perhaps this story originated from the circumstance that he\r\ntravelled much in the company of clergymen in Europe. Vicar-General\r\nQuinn of New York was his companion on the Continent. The late Bishop\r\nMcGill of Richmond, Virginia, a man of ascetic tastes and profound\r\nlearning, often shared Mr. Kelly’s carriage in the latter’s drives\r\nabout Rome. Another thing which may have given color to the rumor was\r\nthe fact that Mr. Kelly had educated, and was still educating, many\r\nyoung men for the ecclesiastical state, not only American youths, but\r\nthose of Irish and German and Swiss nationalities. While he was in\r\nSwitzerland his attention was directed by his daughters to a pious\r\nlittle boy, the son of a poor gardener, who with another boy of wealthy\r\nparentage, served at the altar every morning. The wealthy man’s son\r\nsoon departed for the University, when Mr. Kelly sent for the son of\r\nthe gardener, and finding that he wished to become a religious, told\r\nhim that he would afford him the means to carry out his purpose, and\r\namid the grateful tears and prayers of the boy’s parents, he sent him\r\nto a renowned German University, and defrayed all his expenses until\r\nhe was graduated. That boy has since become a learned scholar and\r\nminister at the altar. While Mr. Kelly was in Rome he became warmly\r\ninterested in the American College, a noble seat of learning in that\r\ncity for the training of young ecclesiastics for the American Missions,\r\nand he generously established a bursary in the College. He gave to its\r\nPresident, Dr. Chatard, who since has been raised to the Episcopate,\r\nfive thousand dollars for the maintenance of this charitable Kelly\r\nfoundation. It reflected no credit upon the managers of the New York\r\nCooper Institute meeting, held in 1884, to denounce the spoliation of\r\nthe Propaganda, of which the American College at Rome is a part, to\r\nhave omitted one of its benefactors, and so prominent a representative\r\nman as John Kelly, from the list of the officers and speakers of that\r\nmeeting. Those managers were then burning incense to Monsignor Capel,\r\na clerical gentleman of know—ledge, not knowledge, who thinks American\r\nCatholics are too illiterate yet awhile to aspire to a University.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful pictures in stained glass, which adorn the windows of\r\nSt. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York, are, with the exception of the\r\nexamples in the French Cathedral in Chartres, perhaps unsurpassed in\r\nmodern times, as figured scenes from the Scriptures and lives of the\r\nsaints. In this pictorial religious epic is a beautiful window placed\r\nthere by John Kelly in memory of his lost ones, or more correctly\r\nof those members of his family who have been called to the better\r\nlife. “Before quitting the Sanctuary,” says the writer of a pamphlet\r\ndescriptive of the exterior and interior of the Cathedral, “we will\r\nbend our steps towards the Lady Chapel. The window in the first bay\r\nrepresents the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin in the Temple. The\r\nhigh priest, in gorgeous vesture, advances to receive the child, while\r\nSt. Joachim and St. Anne modestly remain standing behind. The friends\r\nof the family are assembled to witness the ceremony. This bears the\r\ninscription, ‘John Kelly—_in memoriam_.’”[59]\r\n\r\nSome years before the completion of the new Cathedral, and while Mr.\r\nKelly was in Rome, he gave an order to a celebrated artist in that\r\ncity of art treasures to execute for him four great oil paintings\r\nrepresenting the Baptism of our Lord, the Marriage feast of Cana, the\r\nReturn of the Prodigal Son, and St. Patrick preaching at Tara. He\r\nafterwards embraced two additional scenes from sacred history in his\r\nscheme, the Ascension of Our Lord, and the Assumption of the Blessed\r\nVirgin. The artist, Galliardi, produced a noble work after the best\r\nmasters. These six magnificent paintings were sent from Rome to America\r\nas a present from Mr. Kelly to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and are the\r\nonly paintings in canvas upon the walls of that grand church.\r\n\r\nWhen he was in England he visited a region inhabited almost entirely by\r\nminers—English, Irish and Welsh. Those people were, to a great extent,\r\nignorant of the truths of Christianity, and there were no facilities\r\nin the wild mountain region they inhabited to improve their moral\r\ncondition. Working in the mines day and night, and constantly exposed\r\nto death in the midst of their subterranean toil, these poor people\r\nappealed to friends at a distance to send them a clergyman to minister\r\nto their spiritual wants. The appeal was answered, and the Reverend Mr.\r\nDealy arrived there to open a mission a short time before Mr. Kelly\r\nvisited that part of England. The clergyman found himself destitute of\r\nevery worldly appliance for a proper ministration of the functions of\r\nhis spiritual office, no church, no school-house, no charitable home\r\nor asylum for the sick and helpless, all things, in a word, wanting,\r\nand no adequate means to provide them. He was an excellent and zealous\r\nman, and he stated his situation, and the necessities of the people\r\nto Mr. Kelly. He told him that if he had the money to build a church\r\nand school-house, incalculable good might be done. He poured his story\r\ninto sympathetic ears. Help was promised, and faithfully was the\r\npromise kept. Mr. Dealy some time after, upon Mr. Kelly’s invitation,\r\nset sail for America, and took up his residence in the latter’s house.\r\nWhen Mr. Kelly reached home he organized a movement among those of his\r\nimmediate friends, whose opulence and charity admitted of the appeal,\r\nand in the course of a few months Mr. Dealy, as he informed the writer\r\nof these pages, was the fortunate possessor of a purse of over twelve\r\nthousand dollars, inclusive of Mr. Kelly’s own handsome donation. Those\r\npoor miners in England soon had their church, and a school for their\r\nchildren, and their pastor had reason to bless the day when he first\r\nmade the acquaintance of the subject of this memoir.\r\n\r\nAfter John Kelly had re-entered the field of politics, and even when\r\nimmersed in public affairs, his charity and philanthropy continued to\r\nbe the controlling principles of his conduct. During the past five\r\nor six years he has been a frequent lecturer in various cities of\r\nthe Union. His lectures, respectively upon the Sisters of Charity,\r\nthe Early Jesuit Missionaries in North America, and upon the Irish\r\nSettlers in North and South America, were replete with historical\r\ninformation and sound practical instruction, and wherever he appeared\r\non the platform as a lecturer he always drew crowded houses. Mr. Kelly\r\nrealized from his lectures, which he delivered repeatedly in the North,\r\nSouth and West, over fifty thousand dollars, and this immense sum he\r\ngave in charity to educate and clothe the poor, to build schools, or\r\nto lift the burden of debt from charitable institutions. His heart\r\nwas in his work. He would not allow one penny of the proceeds of\r\nhis lectures to be diverted from the sweet uses of charity for his\r\ntraveling expenses, but in every instance, wherever he went to lecture,\r\nhe insisted on paying his railroad fare, and hotel bills, out of his\r\nown pocket.\r\n\r\nBagenal, the London traducer of the American Irish, with unblushing\r\nmendacity, classes John Kelly as a leader of “shoulder-hitters and\r\nballot-stuffers,” and ignorantly accuses him of being an enemy of Irish\r\ncolonization in the West. The simple truth is that Kelly is one of the\r\noriginators and prime leaders in the movement to get poor emigrants out\r\nof the overcrowded Eastern cities, and has contributed thousands of\r\ndollars to make their colonization in the West a success.\r\n\r\nDr. Ireland, Bishop of St. Paul, Minnesota, one of the great pioneers\r\nin this benign scheme, while speaking kindly of Mr. Bagenal in a\r\nletter to the present writer, still shows how erroneous he is in his\r\nstrictures upon Mr. Kelly. The Bishop’s comment upon Bagenal, is as\r\nfollows: “He is mistaken, of course, in his remarks about Mr. John\r\nKelly. But I do not think he will be sorry to be set right. He mixes\r\nup Mr. Kelly with the average politicians of New York—not knowing,\r\nas I know, Mr. Kelly’s exceptional qualities, his sterling honesty,\r\nhis true love for his fellow-Irishmen, and his general nobility of\r\ncharacter.”[60]\r\n\r\nWhen he retired from politics in 1868, Mr. Kelly had resolved to enter\r\nupon that field no more. Chastened by domestic affliction, and loss of\r\nhealth, the plan of his life was changed. Public station had lost its\r\ncharm for him. To feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and open the doors\r\nof colleges, or advanced schools, to those whose talents were good, but\r\nwho were too poor to gain admittance, these things afforded to him his\r\ngreatest pleasure. He sought out the companionship of holy men, and\r\nof holy books. Thomas à Kempis became his _vade mecum_. He took more\r\ndelight in the pages of the Following of Christ than he had ever known\r\nin the conflicts of politics, either in the halls of Congress or the\r\ncity of New York. It was not altogether surprising, therefore, that\r\npeople’s conjectures should consign him to the prospective seclusion\r\nof a monastery, and that rumors to that effect should have gained\r\ncirculation. The _New York Times_, on one occasion, shortly after Mr.\r\nKelly’s second marriage, made editorial reference to these rumors, and\r\nspoke of him as that remarkable individual who had escaped being a monk\r\nat Rome, in order to become the nephew of a Cardinal in America.\r\n\r\nThese revelations of the inner life of John Kelly are not laid before\r\nthe public without a great deal of reluctance. Some may think it were\r\nbetter to keep them back until after his death, and the writer knows\r\nperfectly well that no one else would prohibit their publication at any\r\ntime, or under any conceivable circumstances more sternly than John\r\nKelly himself. But these pages have been written without consultation\r\nwith any human being in the world, and recollecting the unparalleled\r\nand shameful abuse which this man has been subjected to for doing his\r\nduty as God has given him to see it, the writer is resolved to tell\r\nthe truth about him, and let the unprejudiced reader know something\r\nof his real character. Indeed hardly a tithe of those charities and\r\ngood works of John Kelly which are within the personal knowledge of\r\nthe present writer, have been mentioned in these pages. During the\r\nwar for the Union, especially, were the kindly impulses of his nature\r\ndisplayed. He went about among the hospitals visiting and cheering the\r\nsick and despondent, supplying articles for their relief and money\r\nfor their wants, and doing what he could for the wounded. He did not\r\nconfine these ministrations to the hospitals in New York, but went to\r\nWashington and got a pass from Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, whom\r\nhe had known well in former years, to visit the Army of the Potomac,\r\nand particularly the camp hospitals. Thither he repaired, and extended\r\nhis aid not only to New York soldiers but to those of other States,\r\nwith characteristic zeal and liberality. A letter was published in the\r\nNew York _World_, November 1st, 1875, from Mr. James Murphy, in which\r\nreference is made to one of Mr. Kelly’s visits to the army in Virginia.\r\n\r\n“I well recollect,” said the writer, “that thirteen years ago, when\r\nI was a soldier in the Second Army Corps of the Army of the Potomac,\r\nand stationed at Stafford Heights, Virginia, opposite Fredericksburg,\r\nI had the pleasure of meeting Mr. John Kelly. His mission was one of\r\nthe noblest that man ever followed. He was going round from hospital\r\nto hospital, and from tent to tent, visiting the sick and wounded of\r\nthe poor and neglected soldiers of the New York regiments, to see to\r\ntheir wants, and alleviate their sufferings as much as lay within his\r\npower, and questioning them as to their treatment as compared with\r\nthe treatment of the soldiers of other States.” Many persons in the\r\nborder States, as those adjoining the scene of military operations were\r\ncalled, who were guilty of no disloyal acts, were nevertheless made\r\nvictims of spies and detectives, and they and their families suffered\r\ngreat hardships. One of these was Mr. John Henry Waring, a prominent\r\nand wealthy citizen of Prince George’s County, Maryland, whose property\r\nwas confiscated, whose large family, mostly ladies, were banished, and\r\nwho was himself imprisoned for the war in Fort Delaware. This was the\r\nwork of Baker, the notorious detective, and a more cruel persecution\r\nhardly occurred during the war. Mr. Kelly was appealed to on behalf of\r\nMr. Waring, and after he was satisfied that injustice had been done\r\nto that excellent citizen, he went to Washington and saw Mr. Lincoln,\r\nand Secretaries Stanton and Montgomery Blair, on behalf of the Waring\r\nfamily and estate. But Baker had poisoned the mind of Stanton against\r\nthe Warings, and, notwithstanding the Secretary’s regard for Mr. Kelly,\r\nhe refused the clemency that was asked. Mr. Kelly returned to New\r\nYork, and enlisted in Mr. Waring’s favor the powerful co-operation of\r\nGovernor Morgan, Archbishop Hughes, Thurlow Weed, James T. Brady, and\r\nabout fifty other leading men, and, thus strengthened, he renewed the\r\nappeal for justice and executive clemency. Postmaster General Blair had\r\nbecome warmly interested in the case, and to him Mr. Kelly confided\r\nthe petition of the citizens of New York named above, and Mr. Blair\r\nin conjunction with Mr. Kelly ceased not to press the case until Mr.\r\nWaring was liberated, his family were recalled from banishment, and his\r\nbeautiful home and plantation on the Patuxent river were restored to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly returned from Europe in the fall of 1871, much improved in\r\nhealth, but not yet restored to his old vigor. The present writer gave\r\nto Mr. J. E. Mallet, of Washington, D. C., who was going to Europe,\r\na letter of introduction to Mr. Kelly, while the latter was abroad.\r\nAlthough they were near each other several times in Europe, Mr. Mallet\r\ndid not become acquainted with Mr. Kelly until they accidentally met\r\non the same steamship, the _Republic_, in returning to America. In a\r\nletter published in the Baltimore Catholic _Mirror_, Mr. Mallet gave an\r\ninteresting account of this voyage, and of the amusements improvised on\r\nshipboard. “One evening,” said he, “we organized a musical and literary\r\nentertainment. The chairman made a speech, a lady played a fine musical\r\ncomposition, a gentleman gave a recitation, a young bride sang a\r\nbeautiful ballad, Hon. John Kelly, of New York, sang in excellent style\r\nan amusing Irish song, then a duet was sung by two ladies, some one\r\nsang a French song, Father Sheehy sang an Irish ballad on St. Patrick,\r\nand the entertainment concluded, and the assemblage dispersed during\r\nthe reading by the Rev. Dr. Arnot, of one of his old sermons.”\r\n\r\n“A valued friend had given me a letter of introduction to Mr. Kelly,\r\nto present in France or Switzerland, but I met that gentleman only\r\non the wharf at Liverpool, and then almost accidentally. Mr. Kelly\r\nhas travelled throughout Europe and the Holy Land, and is one of the\r\nmost interesting travelling companions whom I have ever met. I was\r\nparticularly pleased with his manner of presenting the true history of,\r\nand reasons for certain religious and national practices in Ireland and\r\nItaly, in opposition to the theories and suppositions of certain of our\r\nfellow-voyagers, who ignorantly calumniated the one, and ridiculed the\r\nother.”\r\n\r\nDuring the three years of Mr. Kelly’s absence in Europe, New York\r\nhad been given over to every form of official rascality and plunder.\r\nNo sooner had he reached the city than he was besieged by leading\r\ncitizens, such as Mr. Tilden, Mr. Schell, Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Belmont,\r\nMr. Chanler, Mr. Clark, Mr. Green and others, all of whom urged him\r\nto take the lead in a movement for the overthrow of the Tweed Ring.\r\nTo each one of these gentlemen he said that it was not in accord with\r\nthe plan of life which he had marked out for himself for the future,\r\nto re-enter the field of active politics. But his friends redoubled\r\ntheir importunities. They told him there was no other man in New York,\r\nscarcely one in the United States, so well fitted as himself to head\r\nsuch a movement, and that in the lifetime of but very few persons did\r\nso grand an opportunity offer itself to serve the people as that which\r\nnow awaited him. His friends finally prevailed, his private plans were\r\nchanged, and his memorable reappearance in New York politics occurred\r\nin the year 1872. “My health remains about the same as when I saw\r\nyou,” said Mr. Kelly, in 1872, in a letter to the present writer. “I\r\nwas compelled to take part, for the reason that my old associates\r\nwould not take No for answer. My active participation has not helped\r\nme much in point of health, nor does it seem possible for me to live\r\nin New York without being more or less mixed up in politics.” In an\r\ninterview published in the New York _World_, October 18, 1875, Mr.\r\nKelly explained more fully how he was induced to return to politics.\r\nDetails omitted, the salient points of that interview were as follows:\r\n“When I returned from Europe in the fall of 1871, it was my intention\r\nto have nothing to do with politics at all. I had been sorely afflicted\r\nby the loss of my family, and I wanted to spend the rest of my life\r\nas a private business man. I was met by a number of leading men, who\r\ntold me that during my absence the Democratic party in the city had\r\nbecome utterly demoralized, and that the Grant Republicans, taking\r\nadvantage of this state of affairs, had come into full possession in\r\nthis great Democratic city, and they begged me to assume an active\r\npart. I had hundreds of the leading men in the city here at my house,\r\nasking me to take hold and help them up. After much importunity, I\r\nconsented, and threw my whole heart into the work. I suppose I have\r\nsome foresight. I think I generally see things pretty clearly, and this\r\nis probably why they trust to my judgment. Whenever I fail to win their\r\nconfidence it will be an easy matter for them to dispense with me. I\r\nam not commissioned as a leader by any constituted authority. But as\r\nwhat power and influence I have depend entirely upon the good will and\r\nconfidence of the people who choose to recognize me as a leader, and\r\nlisten to my advice, I am wholly in their hands, and they can keep me\r\nor reject me any day.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s part in public affairs prior to 1872 had been creditable\r\nand marked by ability, but there were other public men who, in like\r\ncircumstances, had attained equal or greater distinction. In the year\r\n1872 he was called upon to prove whether he was endowed with that\r\nhighest of all the gifts of Heaven, the capacity to lead men in a\r\nsupreme emergency, and it is not the language of eulogy to say that he\r\ndisplayed consummate ability as such a leader; and that his courage,\r\ncoolness and good judgment enabled him to achieve results which no\r\nother citizen of New York, with similar resources at command, and\r\nsimilar obstacles in his way, could have accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _yours truly_\r\n\r\n_John Kelly_\r\n\r\n(AT THE AGE OF 50 YEARS.)]\r\n\r\nIn a city of a million inhabitants, where a Government had prevailed\r\nfor years, such as disgraced Rome in the days of Caligula, when the\r\ntyrant made his horse a Roman Consul; or in the epoch from Tiberius to\r\nNero, when folly, crime and profligacy ran riot in all departments of\r\nthe Empire, such as Tacitus describes so vividly in the Annals, and in\r\nthe immortal Life of Agricola; in such a state of affairs it was an\r\nenormous task for John Kelly to head a successful movement against a\r\nRing intrenched in office, with millions of stolen money at command,\r\nand backed up by a purchased Legislature. This task he undertook and\r\naccomplished, and history will record the fact on its imperishable page\r\nthat the gallant attack upon the Ring in the Courts and Legislature,\r\nby Charles O’Conor and Samuel J. Tilden, was not crowned with final\r\nsuccess until John Kelly carried the war into Tammany Hall, and drove\r\nthe Ring politicians from its portals. O’Conor and Tilden scotched the\r\nsnake in 1871, and John Kelly killed it in 1872. Tammany Hall, the\r\ncradle of American Democracy, whose patriotic Sachems in the year\r\n1819 were addressed in a speech by Andrew Jackson,[61] and in long\r\nfriendly letters at the same period by Thomas Jefferson, the elder\r\nAdams, and James Madison,[62] was rescued from disgrace and placed\r\nagain in control of honest men in 1872 by John Kelly. Not only the\r\npolitical organization, but the Tammany Society was wrested from the\r\ncontrol of the Ring. No political contest in the history of the city of\r\nNew York was more stubbornly fought on both sides, or has been followed\r\nby happier results to the people at large. If great public service\r\nentitles a man to rank among the worthies of the Republic, John Kelly\r\nwon that title when he succeeded in expelling the Ring men from Tammany\r\nHall. His victory marked an epoch. The Board of Sachems of the Tammany\r\nSociety for 1871, and the Board for 1872 tell the story of this great\r\nrevolution:\r\n\r\n        1871.                        1872.\r\n\r\n   _Grand Sachem_:             _Grand Sachem_:\r\n  WILLIAM M.

HEWITT,\r\n                                    ETC.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of Mr. Belmont from the Chairmanship of the National\r\nDemocratic Committee, in 1872, that distinguished position was tendered\r\nto Mr. Kelly at the meeting of the National Convention in Baltimore.\r\nBut domestic affliction had again visited him about that time, in the\r\ndeath in New York of his only surviving daughter, his elder daughter\r\nhaving died some time before in a city in Spain, where her father had\r\ntaken her in a vain pursuit of health. Cast down by these afflictions,\r\nMr. Kelly declined the Chairmanship of the National Committee of\r\nhis party, but suggested his old friend Mr. Schell, who was elected\r\nChairman. “Who is John Kelly?” asked some of the younger delegates at\r\nBaltimore, when they heard his name mentioned as their first choice\r\nby the New York delegation. They were informed by Mr. Schell that Mr.\r\nKelly was detained at home in the house of mourning, but that he was a\r\ngreat leader in New York politics, and a true patriot in public life;\r\nand that he had sat in Congress before many of those young men were\r\nwell out of the nursery.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the Committee of Seventy set out to reform\r\nthe city government, but those worthy old gentlemen soon became engaged\r\nin an amusing scramble for office, and beyond putting their chairman,\r\nGeneral Dix, in the Governor’s chair, and another of their number,\r\nMr. Havemeyer, in that of Mayor, they did not set the river on fire,\r\nnor perform any of the twelve labors of Hercules. As soon as the\r\nCommittee of Seventy became known as office-seekers, their usefulness\r\nwas at an end. John Kelly sought no office, for he had to fight a\r\nbattle with office-holders, then a synonym for corruptionists, and\r\nhe appreciated the magnitude of the struggle more correctly than to\r\nleave it in anybody’s power to say that the Ring men and the Reform\r\nelement, the latter marshalled by Tilden and himself, were fighting\r\nover the offices. A mere scramble for office between the Ins and Outs\r\nis always a vulgar thing. When they became place-hunters, the Committee\r\nof Seventy ceased to be reformers. Kelly, with better statesmanship,\r\nsought no office, and would accept none. When every other event in his\r\nlife has been forgotten, his memorable battle in the County Convention\r\nof 1872 will still be remembered. A fiercer one was never fought in\r\nAmerican politics. To employ the words of Mr. Tilden, in his history\r\nof the overthrow of the Tammany Ring, Kelly had to confront on that\r\noccasion, “an organization which held the influence growing out of the\r\nemployment of twelve thousand persons, and the disbursement of thirty\r\nmillions a year; which had possession of all the machinery of local\r\ngovernment, dominated the judiciary and police, and swayed the officers\r\nof election.”[63]\r\n\r\nHarry Genet was leader of the Ring men in the Convention.\r\nPrize-fighters and heelers swarmed upon the floor; and when Samuel\r\nB. Garvin was again placed in nomination for District-Attorney, the\r\nfighters and heelers roared themselves hoarse with applause. Mr. Kelly\r\ntook the floor to oppose Garvin, when he was interrupted by Genet. He\r\nreplied to the latter in scathing language, arraigned him and Garvin\r\nwith the utmost severity, and although hissed by the hirelings of the\r\nRing, and interrupted by volleys of oaths, John Kelly kept the mob in\r\nsufficient restraint until he caught the eye of the chairman, and moved\r\nan adjournment to 3 o’clock the next day. Mr. Schell, who was in the\r\nchair, put the motion to adjourn, and it was carried, in spite of the\r\nprotests of the mob.\r\n\r\nThe next day the same emissaries of the Ring were there to overwhelm\r\nthe Convention again, but this time Kelly was prepared for them. He\r\nhad a force stationed at the doors of Tammany Hall, and no man, not a\r\ndelegate to the Convention, and not provided with a delegate’s ticket,\r\nwas allowed to enter the building. The police and city authorities were\r\non the side of the desperadoes, but no policeman was allowed inside\r\nthe premises. This bold stand of Mr. Kelly had the desired effect. By\r\nhis personal intrepidity, and readiness to resist attack, he cowed the\r\nrowdies, and no others but delegates got into the Convention. Garvin\r\nwas defeated, and Charles Donohue was nominated for District-Attorney.\r\nAbram R. Lawrence was nominated for Mayor. It was in that day’s\r\nstruggle that the backbone of the Ring was broken, and it ceased to\r\nbe a compact organization, and melted away after that day’s defeat.\r\nHavemeyer of the Committee of Seventy was elected Mayor, with Lawrence\r\na close second, and O’Brien a bad third. Phelps beat Donohue for\r\nDistrict-Attorney. But Reformed Tammany, in spite of predictions to the\r\ncontrary, polled a surprisingly large vote, and although it did not\r\nelect, it was a vote of confidence in John Kelly, and discerning men\r\nsaw that the future belonged to the old organization. Mr. Havemeyer,\r\nwho had been an excellent Mayor in early life, now proved a failure.\r\nHis defiance of the Supreme Court in the case of Police Commissioners\r\nCharlick and Gardner raised a storm of indignation about his head,\r\nand led to his reprimand by Governor Dix, who threatened his removal\r\nfrom office. Charlick and Gardner had been indicted for a violation of\r\nthe election laws, and Mr. Kelly was very active in bringing on their\r\ntrial. They were convicted by the Jury, and sentenced by Judge Brady\r\nto pay a fine of $250 each, but conviction carried with it a still\r\nseverer penalty, forfeiture of their offices and disability to fill\r\nthem by reappointment. The Mayor’s attempt to reappoint them was an act\r\nof surprising folly, but when the Governor’s reprimand reached him,\r\nwith the statement that his age, and near completion of his term of\r\noffice, alone saved him from removal for contumacy, Mayor Havemeyer’s\r\nrage vented itself in an extravagantly abusive attack on John Kelly.\r\nHe held Mr. Kelly responsible for the trial of Charlick and Gardner,\r\nand after astounding the community by defying the Supreme Court with a\r\nvain attempt to re-instate the guilty officials, he brought the matter\r\nto an impotent conclusion by pouring out a torrent of abuse upon John\r\nKelly, and assailing his record for honesty when he was Sheriff of New\r\nYork. During all the long years which had elapsed since Mr. Kelly had\r\nheld that office, not one syllable had ever been uttered derogatory to\r\nhis exalted character for honesty as Sheriff, until Mayor Havemeyer\r\nmade his reckless charges. Smarting under a sense of humiliation after\r\nthe Gardner-Charlick fiasco, the Mayor allowed bad temper to get the\r\nmastery of his judgment, and the explosion of wrath against Mr. Kelly\r\nfollowed. The animus of the attack was perfectly apparent on its face,\r\nand the good sense of the people was not imposed upon by the revengeful\r\nebullitions of the angry old gentleman. Mr. Kelly promptly instituted a\r\nsuit for damages, but on the very day the trial began, by a remarkable\r\ncoincidence Mayor Havemeyer, stricken by apoplexy, fell dead in his\r\noffice. The passionate events of the moment were forgotten, and a sense\r\nof sorrow pervaded the community. Mr. Havemeyer’s long and honorable\r\ncareer was remembered, and the unfortunate passage in his last days\r\nwas generally, and justly imputed to the misguided counsels of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany Democrats were completely victorious at the election of\r\n1873. Those able lawyers, Charles Donohue and Abram R. Lawrence, were\r\nelected to the Supreme Court. The late William Walsh and the late Wm.\r\nC. Connor, both excellent men, were elected County Clerk and Sheriff.\r\nAgain, in 1874, victory perched on the standards of Mr. Kelly. This\r\ntime its dimensions were larger. In addition to a Mayor (Mr. Wickham),\r\nand other city officers, a Governor (Mr. Tilden), and other State\r\nofficers, were chosen by overwhelming Democratic majorities.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly had been the first man to suggest Mr. Tilden’s nomination for\r\nGovernor. His splendid services in the war on the Ring pointed him out\r\nas the fit candidate of his party. Tired out, after his long labors,\r\nMr. Tilden, in 1874, went to Europe to enjoy the first holiday he had\r\nallowed himself for years. But such was his confidence in the judgment\r\nof Mr. Kelly, that a cable message from that friend was sufficient to\r\ncause him to cancel his engagements in Europe, give up his tour, and\r\ntake passage in the first steamer for New York. The Canal Ring was\r\nin motion against Tilden’s nomination, and Kelly, who had found this\r\nout, thought there was no time for delay. Tilden at first expressed\r\ndisinclination for the office, but the Tammany Chief had set his heart\r\non his nomination, and the author of these pages has heard Mr. Tilden\r\nsay that Mr. Kelly’s persistency finally controlled his decision, and\r\nwon his acquiescence. One of the leading delegates to the Convention of\r\n1874 was Mr. William Purcell, editor of the _Rochester Union_. “To John\r\nKelly,” said Purcell editorially, shortly after the election, “more\r\nthan any other man does Governor Tilden owe his nomination and his\r\nmajority at the election. Governor Tilden was personally present at the\r\nnominating convention, in close counsel with Mr. Kelly, than whom he\r\nlauded no man higher for his personal honesty, his political integrity,\r\nand his purity of purpose.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden was a constant visitor at Mr. Kelly’s house during this\r\nperiod, and no two men could have evinced more respect and friendship\r\nfor each other. The last time Mr. Tilden attended a meeting in Tammany\r\nHall was at the election of Sachems on the third Monday of April, 1874.\r\nThe late Matthew T. Brennan and others ran an opposition or anti-Kelly\r\nticket, and so anxious was Mr. Tilden for the defeat of this movement\r\nthat he came down to the Wigwam, and took an active part in favor of\r\nthe regular ticket. He sat with Mr. Kelly, and when the result was\r\nannounced warmly congratulated him upon the victory.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of January, 1875, a few weeks after Mr. Tilden’s\r\ninauguration as Governor, the author spent a morning at his residence\r\nin Gramercy Park, and there met ex-Governor Seymour and Mr. Kelly,\r\nin company with Governor Tilden. The conversation of these three\r\ndistinguished men, in the abandon of social intercourse around the\r\nhearthstone of Gramercy Park, was very agreeable and entertaining.\r\nThe author was an attentive listener and observer, and afterwards, on\r\nthe same day, wrote out in his diary his impressions of these three\r\ncelebrated New Yorkers. Although ten years have elapsed since those\r\nimpressions were written, they are here reproduced in the exact words\r\nin which they were then put down in the diary, without the alteration\r\nof a single sentence:\r\n\r\n[Conversed with Messieurs Seymour, Tilden and Kelly at 15 Gramercy Park\r\nto-day. Big fellows all of them, but entirely distinct types. Let me\r\nsee if I can depict them.\r\n\r\nHoratio Seymour is a man well advanced in life, tall, well-shaped,\r\nthough rather spare in build, with a beaming open countenance, a\r\nbright speaking eye, expressive mouth and a large nose. The marks\r\nand lines of the face and forehead are deep and strong. His language\r\nis quite Saxon in its selection and character, words of one or two\r\nsyllables prevailing. His expression of thought was clear enough to\r\nbe taken down by a stenographer as prepared utterances. His range of\r\nsubjects is large, and his treatment of each ready and versatile.\r\nIt is conversation all the time, not platform or stump-speaking.\r\nThe fault with him seems to be one which any person of such eminent\r\nparts might be liable to—it is an occasional tendency to diffusion,\r\na Narcissus-like disposition to dwell on the shadow mirrored in the\r\nwave; not vanity, but an introspective play of thought. His mental bent\r\nis speculative, which perhaps accounts for his sometimes presenting a\r\nthought under a great variety of aspects. He throws out an opinion, and\r\nfollows it up by a profusion of suggestive considerations. Instead,\r\nhowever, of pausing after the stroke was dealt, he would now and again\r\nkeep on elaborating his points until the conversation began to expand\r\ninto a disquisition. The key remained conversational still, while the\r\nrange was widening. But let an interruption occur, and the ex-Governor\r\nknew how to conclude with a hasty stroke or two. His descriptive power\r\nis good, but not so good as his reach and closeness of observation into\r\ngeneral principles, and his capacity to grasp and develop causes and\r\neffects. He is more of a philosopher than a delineator, and has humor\r\ntoo, which draws the laugh at will.\r\n\r\nGovernor Tilden is a spare, close-cut man, of rather a nautical\r\nappearance. You might mistake him in a crowd for a weather-beaten old\r\ntar retired from the deck of a man-of-war, to enjoy a little needed\r\nrepose. His movements and quiet speech suggest the idea to a stranger\r\nof a cold, formal, negative man, reticent, receptive, and not easily\r\nto be enlisted in ordinary matters. Five minutes conversation with him\r\nwill suffice to upset such an opinion. First you will most probably be\r\nstruck with his eyes, which have an indefinable expression. It would\r\nbe spectral, if it were not now melancholy, and again indicative of a\r\nwomanly tenderness. There is a peculiar play in them which expresses\r\na great deal. His voice is low, and one might suppose, till he begins\r\nto converse, that he is a better listener than talker. The forehead is\r\ngnarled and concentrated, and on phrenological principles would not\r\nindicate a marked presence of the intellectual faculties, considered\r\nby itself; but if you draw an imaginary line from the tip of the ears\r\nacross the head, it is evident that the brain power from the brows\r\nto this line is proportionately very large, and phrenologically very\r\nstrong. His nose is a decided aquiline, the mouth full but compressed,\r\nand the chin prominent, and indicative of a marked preponderance of\r\nthe vital forces. His conversation is more nervous than Seymour’s,\r\nbut not so copious. He seems better pleased with the suggestion than\r\nelaboration of ideas. He can, however, when you don’t want to talk but\r\nto listen, throw an analytical strength into his expressions which\r\nsustains his reputation for sagacity and vigor. Governor Tilden is\r\nclassical in diction. The right word is used all the time, although\r\nnot a shadow of art is perceptible in the language. He seems bent\r\non convincing you by what he has to say, and not by his manner of\r\nsaying it. His method of reasoning is logical and exhaustive, and yet\r\nit is analytical and not synthetical. He leaves his listener to draw\r\nconclusions. He is less given to generalization than to subtle methods\r\nof mastering subjects. He has a quiet way of talking, and of saying\r\ntrenchant, sententious things. Governor Tilden strikes me as a man who\r\nwould be very slow to gain popularity by dash of manners or exterior\r\nconduct, but as having grit in him, and a genius for accomplishing what\r\nhe undertakes. He is already named in several quarters as a prominent\r\nDemocratic candidate for the next Presidency.\r\n\r\nJohn Kelly, leader of Tammany Hall, remains to be described. He is a\r\nvery different man from Seymour or Tilden. An English traveler once\r\nheard Daniel Webster on the stump in an interior New England town. As\r\nhe gazed at “Black Dan” with his massy brows playing with ponderous\r\nthought, and his great arm and big body swaying back and forth in\r\nobedience to the ideas he was expressing, the first impression of the\r\nEnglishman was: “Why this man Webster, with his herculean frame and\r\nsledge-hammer fist, would have proved the most formidable gladiator\r\nthat ever entered the arena—if Providence had not given him a still\r\nbigger head than body. He is a magnificent creature considered as\r\nan animal, but a still more magnificent man.” Kelly answers this\r\ndescription. The New York _Herald_ once compared him to General\r\nGrant on account of his quiet manners and reticence. He stands two\r\nor three inches under six feet, weighs about two hundred and thirty\r\nor forty pounds, is active and firm in step and movement, and from\r\nhis leonine aspect must be the envy of those who delight in the manly\r\nart of self-defence. His forehead is massive and broad, with a wealth\r\nof phrenological development; over his physiognomy are the lines of\r\ndecision and benevolence of character. The under jaw is large and\r\nfirmly set, imparting to his face an air of command and resolution. In\r\nconversation he is modest and direct, and seldom speaks of himself.\r\nThat he is a man of action is at once revealed to the observer. He has\r\nhumor and a keen appreciation of the amusing side of human nature. His\r\nmanners are quiet and frank, but underneath there is discernible a\r\ncool and commanding spirit. A mingled air of _bonhommie_ and sternness\r\nproclaims to all that he knows how to command obedience as well as\r\nrespect, and if once fairly aroused no man can confront an enemy with\r\nsterner mien, or more annihilation in his glance. Those who have seen\r\nhim in stormy public place, where such qualities alone avail, have\r\noften witnessed this quiet man’s transformation into the fiery ruler of\r\nhis fellows.[64]]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary victories of the Tammany Democracy for several years\r\nafter Mr. Kelly became its leader, at length aroused jealousies and\r\nrivalries, and it began to look as though the successful leader had\r\nenemies in Printing-house Square. Perhaps the editors thought they\r\nshould have been consulted more frequently in regard to nominations\r\nand other matters, and perhaps Mr. Kelly made a mistake in not oftener\r\nseeking their advice. At all events, an animated newspaper fire was\r\nopened upon him in 1875. He was called a boss, a dictator; “one man\r\npower” was furiously denounced; and so savage was this onslaught, that\r\nif the editors had not modified their expressions after election,\r\nand even begun again to speak handsomely of him, one might have\r\nimagined that John Kelly was a veritable Ogre, a lineal successor\r\nto Tweed, instead of the destroyer of Tweedism. But it was all only\r\na custom of the country at elections, and not an expression of the\r\neditorial conscience. No man occupying a high place ever escapes these\r\nfusillades; John Kelly formed no exception to the invariable rule.\r\nAt the election of that year the Tammany ticket was badly defeated.\r\nReplying to these denunciations against the Tammany Chief, Mr. Abram\r\nS. Hewitt, then Chairman of the General Committee of the Tammany\r\nDemocracy, made a speech, October 30, 1875, in the course of which he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“The assertion that John Kelly is a dictator is an insult to Tammany\r\nand its members. All organizations must have leaders, and no one but\r\nJohn Kelly could have done the work that he has performed. The city\r\nof New York owes to that calumniated man honors that statues could not\r\nadequately pay. There is no desire in John Kelly’s breast so strong as\r\nto be relieved from his present onerous position but if some one of\r\nrespectability was not found to do such labors, the city of New York\r\nwould be soon as uninhabitable as a den of wild beasts.”[65]\r\n\r\nOne of the shrewdest political observers who has figured during recent\r\nyears in New York politics, was the late Hugh J. Hastings, editor\r\nof the _Commercial Advertiser_. As a Republican he was opposed to\r\nDemocrats, but he had the blunt candor to speak of John Kelly in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n“On the ruins of Tweed rose Kelly, of Tammany Hall, and Tilden,\r\nHewitt, and Cooper joined his Court, and were numbered among his\r\nlegions. Under Kelly the condition of society has improved in the\r\ncity, and we might add the municipal government,—all know there was\r\ngreat room for improvement. Kelly has ruled the fierce Democracy in\r\nsuch a manner that life and property are comparatively safe. It is a\r\nfearful responsibility to hold this wild element in check. Beasts of\r\nburden may easily be managed by a new master. But will the wild ass\r\nsubmit to the bonds? Will the unicorn serve and abide his crib? Will\r\nthe leviathan hold out his nostrils to the hook? The mythological\r\nconqueror of the East, whose enchantments reduced wild beasts to the\r\ntameness of domestic cattle, and who harnessed lions and tigers to his\r\nchariot, is but an imperfect type of the man who can control the wild,\r\nwhiskey-drinking and fierce spirits that make up the worst elements\r\nof this great city. It requires a great man to stand between the City\r\nTreasury and this most dangerous mass. It demands courage, activity,\r\nenergy, wisdom, or vices so splendid and alluring as to resemble\r\nvirtues. Again we say, dethrone Kelly, and where is the man to succeed\r\nhim?”[66]\r\n\r\nThe spirit of faction, the curse of New York politics from the\r\nbeginning of the century, was again distracting the Democratic party.\r\nNew York and Albany are natural political antagonists, as were Carthage\r\nand Rome of old.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Conventions of 1821 and 1846, by enlarging the\r\nelective features of government, had greatly relieved New York, and\r\ngreatly diminished the power of the Albany Regency, but the love of\r\npower is inbred in man, and special legislation at the State capital\r\nstill holds the giant metropolis in political leading strings. During\r\nMr. Tilden’s administration as Governor, he and his old friend Mr.\r\nKelly became involved in unfortunate differences as leaders of rival\r\nwings of the Democratic party of the State. It were useless here to\r\nrecapitulate the story of this disastrous breach between two statesmen\r\nwho had done so much when acting together to purify the public service;\r\neach occupying the place he held at the wish, and by the powerful\r\nassistance of the other; Kelly in Tammany at Tilden’s urgent request,\r\nand Tilden called back from Europe by a cable dispatch from Kelly to\r\nrun for Governor of New York. It were worse than useless to revive the\r\nbitter memories of the strife. Let them be buried in oblivion. A few\r\nweeks before the St. Louis Convention in 1876, Mr. Tilden called upon\r\nMr. Kelly, and talked over old times. Before leaving, the Governor\r\nhumorously remarked:\r\n\r\n“Now John, you are my sponsor, or political godfather. You found me\r\nnot inclined to take any office two years ago, and you insisted that\r\nI should take the nomination for Governor. No matter what differences\r\nmay have arisen since, remember John, you are my sponsor.” Mr.\r\nKelly smiled, but was non-committal. But that visit, and graceful\r\nreminiscence of a happier day in their political lives did its work\r\nwell. Let the brilliant Philadelphia editor, Alexander McClure, tell\r\nthe sequel. In a letter to his paper from St. Louis, announcing Mr.\r\nTilden’s nomination for the Presidency, Mr. McClure said:\r\n\r\n“The work of the Convention was then done, but it was electrified by\r\nthe appearance on the main aisle of the full-moon, Irish face of John\r\nKelly, the Anti-Tilden Tammany Sachem. Those who hissed and howled at\r\nhim yesterday, now greeted him with thunders of approval, and called\r\nhim to the platform. When he appeared there a whisper could have\r\nbeen heard in any part of the hall, and when he gave in his adhesion\r\nto Tilden and Hendricks, and pledged his best efforts for their\r\nelection, he was crowned and welcomed as the returning prodigal of the\r\nhousehold.”[67]\r\n\r\nRight nobly did John Kelly keep that pledge. Rutherford B. Hayes came\r\nin from the rural districts of New York 30,000 ahead of Samuel J.\r\nTilden. When he reached the Harlem River he found that Tammany Hall\r\nhad given Mr. Tilden 54,000 majority in the city of New York, and had\r\nwrested the Empire State from the Republicans. President-elect Tilden\r\nsent a message of congratulation on that memorable election night to\r\nJohn Kelly, and his warmest salutations to the invincible tribe of\r\nSaint Tammany, as “the right wing of the Democratic Army.”\r\n\r\nBy changing dates and names, it will be found that Mr. Kelly’s services\r\nin the Cleveland campaign of 1884 were an exact repetition of his\r\nservices in 1876. He gave the same loyal support to Grover Cleveland\r\nthat he had given to Samuel J. Tilden. He held his forces in hand\r\nmagnificently, and if the high honor may be attributed to any one man\r\nof carrying New York through the most desperate conflict ever waged\r\nwithin her borders, safely out of the very jaws of defeat, to the\r\nDemocratic column, that honor belongs to Honest John Kelly. To save\r\nGrover Cleveland, Kelly sacrificed every man on his local ticket, every\r\ndear friend who bore the Tammany standards on that eventful day, which\r\ndecided the destinies of the United States for the next four years.\r\n\r\nWhen John Kelly was appointed Comptroller of the City of New York by\r\nMayor Wickham, in 1876, the debt of the municipality which had been\r\nuniformly accumulating under his predecessors until it reached over a\r\nhundred million of dollars, was first arrested in its upward course,\r\nand brought into a line of rapid reduction. In four brief years he had\r\nreduced the debt $12,000,000, thus justifying the encomiums of the\r\npress at the time of his accession to the office. The New York _Herald_\r\nof December 8, 1876, the day after his appointment, said editorially:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kelly will make a very good Comptroller. He has firmness, honesty\r\nand business capacity. He is the right man in the right place, and a\r\ngreat improvement on Mr. Green. He will guard the treasury just as\r\njealously as the present Comptroller, without being impracticable,\r\nlitigious and obstructive. The people of New York will be satisfied\r\nwith Mr. Kelly.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _World_ of the same date, after dwelling editorially upon\r\nhis great ability, said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kelly’s honesty and integrity are unquestioned, even by his\r\nbitterest political opponents. He is a native of New York city.\r\nBeginning life as a mechanic, by his energy and industry he very soon\r\nmade himself a manufacturer and a merchant. He sat for one term in the\r\nBoard of Aldermen, and was twice elected to Congress. At Washington he\r\nhandled questions of national importance with ability and decorum, and\r\nby the force of his native good sense soon took rank above many men\r\nwho had more experience than he in the national councils. He is best\r\nknown to New Yorkers of the present day as the leader of the Tammany\r\norganization, as the man who took hold of that ancient society after\r\nit had been deservedly defeated, disgraced and overthrown under the\r\nmanagement of members of the old Ring. He reorganized it, filled it\r\nwith new life, and weeded out the men who helped to bring reproach\r\nupon it. The property-holders and taxpayers of this city are to be\r\ncongratulated that the administration of their financial affairs has\r\nfallen into such worthy hands, and will be entrusted to a man of Mr.\r\nKelly’s perspicacious brain and known probity.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _Evening Express_, of the same date, referred to Mr.\r\nKelly’s eminent fitness for the office, and to his services in the\r\nelection of Mr. Tilden to the Presidency, and said, editorially:\r\n“Speaking in a political sense only, Mr. Kelly has well earned this\r\noffice, and even a higher one, for to him more than any other man is\r\nthe credit due for the immense Democratic majority in this city, which\r\ngave the state to Governor Tilden.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _Sun_, of the same date, said editorially:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kelly is an honest and capable man, willing to do a great deal\r\nof hard work, well fitted to look after the important and varied\r\nbusiness of his office, and the financial interests of the city. He is\r\nthe most popular man of the party that governs this city, and stands\r\nwell with the community at large. He will make a good Comptroller.\r\nWhen the nomination of Governor Tilden was made in St. Louis Mr.\r\nKelly promised to do all in his power to insure the success of the\r\npeople’s choice. During the campaign Mr. Kelly’s labors were arduous\r\nand continuous. He gave time and strength and money, and even deferred\r\nhis marriage until the fight should be over. That Mr. Kelly might have\r\nsecured the Mayoralty or any other local office for himself, had he so\r\ndesired, is no secret. That he was urged against his will to take the\r\nComptrollership is asserted by his friends as a fact.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting event in Mr. Kelly’s life is incidentally alluded to by\r\nMr. Dana in the preceding article from the _Sun_. This was his second\r\nmarriage, which took place on the 21st of November, 1876. His wife is\r\nan accomplished lady in every sense of the word, the good helpmeet,\r\nsuch as the Scripture describes. The following, account of the wedding,\r\nis taken from the New York _World_:\r\n\r\n“As announced in _The World_ of yesterday, promptly at the hour of 8 in\r\nthe morning, the ceremonies began that were to end in the marriage of\r\nMr. John Kelly to Miss Teresa Mullen, a niece of Cardinal McCloskey.\r\nAbout 7.30 the very few who were to participate in the event assembled\r\nat Cardinal McCloskey’s house in Madison avenue, where, in the private\r\nchapel of His Eminence, the marriage was to take place. This alone was\r\na compliment of the highest order in Church etiquette, doubtless owing\r\nto the relationship of the bride to His Eminence. The little company\r\ninvited to witness the ceremony was gathered together in the parlor of\r\nthe mansion. The party consisted, besides Mr. Kelly, of Mr. Francis D.\r\nCleary, brother-in-law of the bride; Mr. Edward L. Donnelly, Colonel\r\nGeorge W. Wingate, and Mr. Kelly’s nephew, Hugh Kelly. Above stairs\r\nwas assembled the bride with her two sisters, Mrs. Francis D. Cleary\r\nand Miss Mullen. At the hour appointed the Rev. Father Farley made\r\nhis appearance at the parlor door, and announced that all was ready.\r\nThe gentlemen at once arose and proceeded to the chapel on the third\r\nfloor, Mr. Kelly and Father Farley being last. On the way to the chapel\r\nMr. Kelly was joined by the bride, and, arm in arm, the couple slowly\r\npassed up to the double _Prie-Dieu_, before the altar under the escort\r\nof Father Farley. Meantime all had taken their respective positions in\r\nthe beautiful little chapel, in the order peculiar to Catholic Church\r\netiquette. All knelt in silent prayer for some few moments, when the\r\nvenerable Cardinal made his appearance, preceded by the Rev. Father\r\nFarley, Very Rev. Vicar-General Quinn, and one handsome little boy\r\ndressed like a miniature Cardinal, who acted as candle-bearer to His\r\nEminence.\r\n\r\n“The Cardinal in his scarlet robes then took his place before the\r\naltar, with the Vicar-General to his right, and Father Farley and the\r\nacolyte to his left. Immediately behind His Eminence knelt the future\r\nhusband and wife, side by side. After a moment’s silent prayer the\r\nCardinal began the services. Laying off the mozetta, the Vicar-General\r\nand Father Farley enrobed His Eminence. The amice, alb, cincture,\r\npectoral cross, stole, cope and mitre having been placed upon his head\r\nand shoulders, the Cardinal turned to perform the marriage ceremony.\r\nThe vestments worn were white and gold. The ring was blessed, and the\r\nCardinal said: ‘John Kelly, do you take this woman to be your lawful\r\nwife?’\r\n\r\n‘I do.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you promise to love and cherish her until death?’\r\n\r\n‘I do.’ And so likewise vowed Teresa Mullen to love and honor John\r\nKelly until death.\r\n\r\n“A few more prayers, and His Eminence turned from the kneeling couple,\r\nleaving them man and wife. The crozier, mitre and cope were laid aside;\r\nand His Eminence, putting on the chasuble, commenced the nuptial Mass,\r\n_pro sponsis_. The gospel of the Mass is the recital of the marriage of\r\nCanaan, when Christ changed the water into wine. The Mass progressed\r\nslowly to the communion, when the newly-married received the Sacrament.\r\nJust after the _Pater Noster_, the two kneeling on the step of the\r\naltar, His Eminence read from the missal, with mitre on head, the long\r\nprayer imploring from God harmony and peace in the domestic relations\r\nof the newly-married, and praying that if God should bless them with\r\nchildren, they might be brought up in the fear of the Lord. This over,\r\nthe Mass soon ended. After the Mass the little congregation and the\r\nclergy withdrew, leaving the Cardinal, and Mr. and Mrs. Kelly together.\r\nA few kind words of encouragement, and advice, and congratulations\r\nwere administered by the Cardinal; and, while he remained to say a few\r\nprayers, Mr. and Mrs. Kelly joined their friends, and received their\r\nwell wishes.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn concluding this volume the author regrets that he has not found room\r\nfor more of Mr. Kelly’s speeches. They are all full of good sense, and\r\noccasionally they display a high order of eloquence. The present plan\r\ndid not admit of their introduction. One, however, must be included, as\r\nit illustrates the witty side of his character, and was spoken of by\r\nthose who heard it as a very happy after-dinner speech. It was made\r\nbefore the Lotos Club, January 11, 1879, at the dinner given to Mayor\r\nCooper, soon after that gentleman had entered upon his duties as Mayor\r\nof the city of New York.\r\n\r\nThe following is the report in the _Herald_ of January 12, 1879:\r\n\r\n“The seating capacity of the large dining room of the Lotos Club was\r\ntaxed to the utmost last evening. Mayor Cooper, and the retiring Mayor,\r\nSmith Ely, Jr., being the guests of the club. About ninety members and\r\nguests found seats at the tables, and nearly as many more, who were\r\npresent during the delivery of the speeches, had to content themselves\r\nwith standing room. Mr. Whitelaw Reid, president of the club, presided\r\nat the middle table, and at the heads of the upper and lower tables,\r\nrespectively, sat the vice-presidents, Noah Brooks and Dr. Charles J.\r\nPardee. Among the persons present as members or guests were Postmaster\r\nJames, Chauncey M. Depew, Augustus Schell, John Kelly, Judge Noah\r\nDavis, Robert B. Roosevelt, Peter Cooper, Charles H. Chapin, Paul Du\r\nChaillu, Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, Colonel Thomas W. Knox, George Osgood,\r\nFrederick B. Noyes, Moses Mitchell, Drs. Hammond, Arnold and Callen,\r\nand General Barnum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPTROLLER KELLY’S SPEECH.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly was very cordially greeted when, in answer to a pressing\r\ncall for ‘a few words,’ he rose to speak.\r\n\r\n“_Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Lotos Club:_— I have read\r\nfrequently in the papers of the Lotos Club, but never before had even\r\nthe honor to know where it met after it left Irving Place, and when\r\nasking to-night where the Lotos Club was, I was informed that it was\r\ndirectly opposite the Union Club. I do not know what progress the Lotos\r\nClub has made in life since its organization, but certainly you are at\r\na point in this city—on Fifth avenue—where they say the aristocracy\r\nlive. If this is a specimen of the aristocracy I am entirely content to\r\nmix with them at all times. (Applause and laughter). As the president\r\nof the Club has said, you have a mixture here of all kinds, and that\r\npolitical discussions are never brought among you. I will say that that\r\nis a very friendly state of society when you can come together and talk\r\nof everything but politics. I have always noticed in life, particularly\r\nin public affairs, that the first topic broached was politics, and it\r\nusually commenced by abusing somebody. (Laughter). Now that has been\r\nmy misfortune. I got along very well in my early political life. I had\r\nvery little said against me, but I found after a few years that I was\r\nabout as bad a fellow in the estimation of some people as could be\r\nfound in this community, or any other. (Laughter). But it don’t worry\r\nme a bit. (Laughter). I have got to that state of mind that I feel\r\nif a man is conscious that he is trying to do his best, as well as he\r\ncan understand it, he need care very little what may be said about\r\nhim. (Applause). A man’s conscience should at all times be his master.\r\n(Applause). Now, I do not think that politics should be brought into\r\ndiscussion here. Mayor Cooper has a very important duty to perform.\r\nProbably he can hardly realize yet the amount of labor he must go\r\nthrough, and no man can tell until he gets into the Mayor’s office.\r\nI suppose our friend Ely here, when he first entered on his duties,\r\nconsidered it a light place, but he was not there long before he saw\r\nthat the labor was immense. I do not mean to say that the intellectual\r\nlabor is immense, but the responsibility connected with the office. I\r\nam exceedingly anxious, so far as I am concerned, that Mayor Cooper’s\r\nadministration may be successful. (Loud applause.) Mayor Cooper is not\r\nthe representative of a party; he leaves the party behind him. And he\r\nundoubtedly will be successful, because I sincerely believe that he\r\nhas the full interest of the people at heart, and that he will do his\r\nbest to serve them. (Applause.) I have said so since his election,\r\nand I said so before his election. People have various opinions about\r\nparties. Our friend Reid here sometimes scolds, but probably if he\r\nknew the truth he would not say such things about public officers as\r\nhe does. (Laughter.) I do not mean to say that he will allow himself\r\nto be prejudiced or biased, but he will get a notion in his head, and\r\nsay, ‘That fellow is not doing right, and I will take him to task for\r\nit,’ and so he goes at it. (Laughter.) Mayor Cooper now has the support\r\nof the press of this city, but he will probably find that before the\r\nend of his term the press will begin to find fault with him. Then\r\nMayor Cooper will say, ‘I have not done anything in particular that I\r\nknow of that they should abuse me. Damn the fellow; I will go and see\r\nhim.’ (Great laughter.) I do not mean to say that Mr. Cooper will do\r\nthat either, because he is a very sensible man, but I know that our\r\nfriend Ely did it repeatedly. (Great laughter.) I have often gone into\r\nhis office after he came in in the morning. He had read the papers at\r\nhome, and was full of them. Down he comes to the office, slaps his hat\r\non his head, and off he goes to the _Times_. The _Times_ man tells\r\nhim, ‘Well, we will look into this thing.’ (Laughter.) He has not got\r\na satisfactory answer from the _Times_, and off he starts for our\r\nfriend of the _Tribune_. Then Mr. Reid says, ‘Well, Mr. Ely, I don’t\r\nknow; there are various opinions about this matter. I cannot give you\r\na positive answer about it. I will look into the thing, and let you\r\nknow.’ (Laughter.) So, Ely goes the rounds. Back he comes disconsolate.\r\nHe says, ‘I have seen all these fellows of the press, and they are\r\nall alike, they are abusing me for nothing. They can’t do that. I\r\nhave been in the leather business, and I refer them to that trade.\r\nGo and ask Schultz; go and ask any fellow down in the Swamp whether\r\nI ever took anything that didn’t belong to me.’ (Laughter.) Then he\r\nbecomes a philosopher and says, ‘What is the use of talking? They are\r\nonly one man. Each controls his paper, and has individual opinions.\r\nThe ‘boys’ are with me. (Loud laughter.) I will throw myself on the\r\n‘boys.’ (Renewed laughter.) ‘They can say what they please about me.’\r\nAfter a few days pass down he comes to the office again, and says,\r\n‘The _Times_ is raising the devil this morning,’ and so the thing goes\r\non. (Laughter.) Now, gentlemen, I will say this. You have a very large\r\ncity. Some people in public office must be censured. It is necessary,\r\nprobably, sometimes that they should be, for it often has a beneficial\r\neffect. There is a large number of people who will say that there has\r\nbeen no reform in the city government, and will never take the trouble\r\nto find out whether there is or not. During the time Mayor Ely has been\r\nin office great progress has been made; but I venture to say that,\r\nwhile the debt of the city has been reduced $6,300,000 inside of two\r\nyears, by the end of the term of the present Mayor, if things should\r\ncontinue in the same way, as there is no reason why they should not,\r\nyou will find that the debt will have been reduced from $3,000,000 to\r\n$4,000,000. (Applause.) That will be an accomplishment of $10,000,000\r\ninside of four years. (Applause.) Yes; I venture to say that if I\r\nremain in office—whatever has occurred, let that pass; I do not refer\r\nto it—but if he and I work together in the interests of the city, the\r\ndebt in the next two years will be reduced $8,000,000. (Applause.)\r\nI wish Mayor Cooper all the success in public life that any friend\r\nof his can wish him, and I assure him and his friends that so far as\r\nthe official business of this city is concerned, there will be no\r\ndisagreement between us on matters which are really in the interest of\r\nthe people. (Long continued applause.)\r\n\r\nSpeeches were made during the evening by Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, Chauncey\r\nM. Depew, Robert B. Roosevelt and Judge Noah Davis.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs this volume goes to press Mr. Kelly, who has been indisposed\r\nrecently, is again recovering his health. His severe labors in the\r\nrecent Presidential campaign brought on an attack of his old trouble of\r\ninsomnia. He is now steadily improving, and rides horseback for one or\r\ntwo hours every day. Referring to his sickness, the New York _Times_ of\r\nDecember 12, 1884, contained the following remarks:\r\n\r\n“The substantial shoes of Mr. John Kelly stand unoccupied in Mr.\r\nKelly’s Sixty-ninth street mansion, and their owner is taking all the\r\nease which ill-health and restlessness will admit of. Those shoes are\r\nthe object of a great deal of attention. In all the 50,000 voters in\r\nthe Tammany Hall organization, there is not one fit to succeed him as\r\nthe head of the party.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ might have added that there is no one in Tammany Hall who\r\ndesires to succeed Mr. Kelly, and that he has held the leadership of\r\nthat ancient organization nearly five times as long as any other leader\r\nin the whole history of Tammany. But there are other men of no mean\r\nability in the ranks of that organization. They are all the friends,\r\nand not the rivals, of the subject of this memoir.\r\n\r\nThe chief events of John Kelly’s past life are, at least in outline,\r\nnow before the reader. The task which the author set out to perform is\r\ndischarged, to tell the truth about a distinguished citizen, and to let\r\nhim speak for himself, both in his public and private career, during\r\nthe past forty years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. Kelly, and two bright little children, a daughter and son, have\r\nbrought the sunlight back again to John Kelly’s home, where, after this\r\nimperfect sketch of his remarkable career, we leave him a happy man,\r\nand an honored citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] _New York World_, Oct. 18, 1875.\r\n\r\n[54] _New York Herald_, November 19, 1868.\r\n\r\n[55] Life of S.
