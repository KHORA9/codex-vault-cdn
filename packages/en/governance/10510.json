A spring reborn in\r\nthe world's oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and courage\r\nto reinvent America.  When our founders boldly declared America's\r\nindependence to the world, and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew\r\nthat America, to endure, would have to change.  Not change for change\r\nsake, but change to preserve America's ideals:  life, liberty, the\r\npursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nThough we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless.\r\nEach generation of American's must define what it means to be an American.\r\nOn behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his\r\nhalf-century of service to America . . . and I thank the millions of men\r\nand women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression,\r\nfascism and communism.\r\n\r\nToday, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War assumes new\r\nresponsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom, but\r\nthreatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.  Raised in\r\nunrivalled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's\r\nstrongest, but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages,\r\nincreasing inequality, and deep divisions among OUR OWN people.\r\n\r\nWhen George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold,\r\nnews travelled slowly across the land by horseback, and across the ocean\r\nby boat.  Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast\r\ninstantaneously to billions around the world.  Communications and\r\ncommerce are global.  Investment is mobile.  Technology is almost magical,\r\nand ambition for a better life is now universal.\r\n\r\nWe earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with\r\npeople all across the Earth.  Profound and powerful forces are shaking\r\nand remaking our world, and the URGENT question of our time is whether\r\nwe can make change our friend and not our enemy.  This new world has\r\nalready enriched the lives of MILLIONS of Americans who are able to\r\ncompete and win in it.  But when most people are working harder for less,\r\nwhen others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care devastates\r\nfamilies and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small;\r\nwhen the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom; and\r\nwhen millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are\r\ncalling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.\r\n\r\nWe know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps,\r\nbut we have not done so.  Instead we have drifted, and that\r\ndrifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy,\r\nand shaken our confidence.  Though our challenges are fearsome,\r\nso are our strengths.  Americans have ever been a restless, questing,\r\nhopeful people, and we must bring to our task today the vision\r\nand will of those who came before us.  From our Revolution to the\r\nCivil War, to the Great Depression, to the Civil Rights movement,\r\nour people have always mustered the determination to construct from\r\nthese crises the pillars of our history.  Thomas Jefferson believed\r\nthat to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need\r\ndramatic change from time to time.  Well, my fellow Americans,\r\nthis is OUR time.  Let us embrace it.\r\n\r\nOur democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of\r\nour OWN renewal.  There is nothing WRONG with America that cannot be\r\ncured by what is RIGHT with America.\r\n\r\nAnd so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a\r\nnew season of American renewal has begun.\r\n\r\nTo renew America we must be bold.  We must do what no generation has had\r\nto do before.  We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and\r\nin their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt. . .and we\r\nmust do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity.\r\nIt will not be easy.  It will require sacrifice, but it can be done, and\r\ndone fairly.  Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for OUR own\r\nsake.  We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its\r\nchildren.  Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity.  We\r\ncan do no less.  Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into\r\nsleep knows what posterity is.  Posterity is the world to come, the world\r\nfor whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and\r\nto whom we bear sacred responsibilities.  We must do what America does\r\nbest, offer more opportunity TO all and demand more responsibility FROM\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing:\r\nfrom our government, or from each other.  Let us all take more\r\nresponsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our\r\ncommunities and our country.  To renew America we must revitalize\r\nour democracy.  This beautiful capitol, like every capitol since\r\nthe dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation.\r\nPowerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is\r\nIN and who is OUT, who is UP and who is DOWN, forgetting those people\r\nwhose toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way.\r\n\r\nAmericans deserve better, and in this city today there are people\r\nwho want to do better, and so I say to all of you here, let us resolve\r\nto reform our politics, so that power and privilege no longer shout down\r\nthe voice of the people.  Let us put aside personal advantage, so that we\r\ncan feel the pain and see the promise of America.  Let us resolve to make\r\nour government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called \"bold,\r\npersistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows, not our\r\nyesterdays.\"  Let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nTo renew America we must meet challenges abroad, as well as at home.\r\nThere is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is\r\ndomestic.  The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS\r\ncrisis, the world arms race: they affect us all.  Today as an old order\r\npasses, the new world is more free, but less stable.  Communism's\r\ncollapse has called forth old animosities, and new dangers.  Clearly,\r\nAmerica must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.  While\r\nAmerica rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor\r\nfail to seize the opportunities of this new world.  Together with our\r\nfriends and allies, we will work together to shape change, lest it\r\nengulf us.  When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and\r\nconscience of the international community is defied, we will act; with\r\npeaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.  The\r\nbrave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia,\r\nand wherever else they stand, are testament to our resolve, but our\r\ngreatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many\r\nlands.  Across the world, we see them embraced and we rejoice.  Our hopes,\r\nour hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent, who are building\r\ndemocracy and freedom.  Their cause is America's cause.  The American\r\npeople have summoned the change we celebrate today.  You have raised your\r\nvoices in an unmistakable chorus, you have cast your votes in historic\r\nnumbers, you have changed the face of congress, the presidency, and the\r\npolitical process itself.  Yes, YOU, my fellow Americans, have forced the\r\nspring.  Now WE must do the work the season demands.  To that work I now\r\nturn with ALL the authority of my office.  I ask the congress to join\r\nwith me; but no president, no congress, no government can undertake THIS\r\nmission alone.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.\r\nI challenge a new generation of YOUNG Americans to a season of service,\r\nto act on your idealism, by helping troubled children, keeping company\r\nwith those in need, reconnecting our torn communities.  There is so much\r\nto be done.  Enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young\r\nin spirit, to give of themselves in service, too.  In serving we recognize\r\na simple, but powerful, truth:  we need each other, and we must care for\r\none another.  Today we do more than celebrate America, we rededicate\r\nourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution,\r\nand renewed through two centuries of challenge, an idea tempered by\r\nthe knowledge that but for fate, we, the fortunate and the unfortunate,\r\nmight have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation\r\ncan summon from its myriad diversity, the deepest measure of unity;\r\nan idea infused with the conviction that America's journey long, heroic\r\njourney must go forever upward.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st Century,\r\nlet us begin anew, with energy and hope, with faith and discipline, and\r\nlet us work until our work is done.  The Scripture says: \"And let us not\r\nbe weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\"\r\nFrom this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in\r\nthe valley.  We have heard the trumpets, we have changed the guard, and\r\nnow each in our own way, and with God's help, we must answer the call.\r\n\r\nThank you, and God bless you all.",
